    "about 25 years ago it was pointed out that high temprerature limit of the field theory is descrived by the same theory with less - dimension and it suffers from severe infrared divergences with dimensionful coupling constant[1 ] . before",
    "these argument infrared divergences associated with massless particle such as photon and graviton has been discussed to determine the infrared structure of one particle state[2].these are known as cut structure or infrared behaviour of the propagator near mass shell.in this kind of works renormalization group analysis or method of spectral function had been applied[2].however in the analysis of three dimensional theory these approaches have not been used.the main reason may be in the dimensionfull coupling constant and the super renormalizability of the model.but in[2,3,4 ] infrared divergence near the mass shell has been given in a model independent way.of course the topological mass soften infrared divergence but it is limited to parity violating case and we concentrate ourselves to parity conserving case[5].at the same time ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional qed with massless fermion has been shown its dynamical chiral symmetry breaking by the analysis of dyson - schwinger ( d - s ) equation and lattice simulation [ 6,7,8,9,10,11,12]and the massless pair instability has been shown by solving behte - salpeter ( b - s ) equation with @xmath0 approximation[13].in condensed matter physics ( 2 + 1)-dimensional fermionic system shows super - conductivity phase .",
    "it has been pointed out that the d - wave superconductor - insulator transition at @xmath1 is analougas to the dynamical mass generation in qed@xmath2.and qed@xmath2 is referred to as an effective theory of phase transition for its pairing instability of massless fermion[14,15].in the previous work we studied fermion propagator based on the mass singularity in qed@xmath2 in quenched approximation with finite bare photon mass in spectral representation[3].after exponentiation one photon matrix element we have the explicit form of the propagator with confining properties , dynamical mass generation as we got in the d - s equation.the purpose of this paper is to improve quenched approximation by taking into account of vacuum polarization.other approaches has shown that the screening effects soften the infrared behaviour [ 1,4,6].especially in [ 1 ] order @xmath3 self - energy of massless fermion was improved by spectral function of photon with vacuum polarization of massless fermion.in this work we use the same spectral function of dressed photon propagator and get the non - perturbative effects by integrating the quenched spectral function of fermion with bare photon mass.as a result linear infrared divergences turned out to be logarithmic one , and @xmath4 is converted to @xmath5 in the spectral function.thus we can remove an infrared cut - off from the dressed fermion propagator away from the threshold , where the coupling constant @xmath6 plays the role of photon mass.in comparison our results with the analysis by unquenched dyson - schwinger equation , our solution is consistent with the latter excepts for wave renormalization @xmath7 in section ii spectral representation of the fermion propagator are defined and we show the way to determine it based on lsz reduction formula and low - energy theorem.in section iii we evaluate the full propagator for quenched case with photon mass as an infrarfed cut - off and improve it by the photon spectral function for unquenched case.in section iv is devoted to the analysis in momentum space of these solutions and the comparison with dyson - schwinger analysis[9,11,12 ] .",
    "in this section we show how to evalute the fermion propagator non pertubatively by the spectral represntation which preserves unitarity and analyticity[2,3,4].the spectral function of the fermion is defined @xmath8 in the quenched approximation the state @xmath9 stands for a fermion and arbitrary numbers of photons,@xmath10 we have the solution for the spectral function @xmath11 which is written symbolically@xmath12 here the notations @xmath13 have been introduced to show the phase space of each photons.to evaluate the contribution of soft photons , first we consider the situation when only the @xmath14th photon is soft.we define the matrix element @xmath15 we consider @xmath16 for @xmath17continue off the photon mass shell by lsz reduction formula:@xmath18 provided@xmath19 where @xmath20 is a gauge fixing parameter.@xmath16 satisfies ward - takahashi - identity@xmath21 provided@xmath22 by translational invariance@xmath23 we get the usual form@xmath24 by the low - energy theorem the fermion pole term in @xmath25 is dominant for the infrared singularity in @xmath26.inclusion of regular terms and their contribution to ward - identities are given for the scalar case[2].hereafter we consider the leading pole term for simplicity .",

    "in this section we consider the renormalization constant and bare mass in our model.it is easy to evaluate the renormalization constant and bare mass defined by the renormalization transformation @xmath100@xmath101@xmath102 there is no pole and it shows the confinement for @xmath103.order parameter @xmath104 is given as the integral of the scalar part of the propagator in momentum space @xmath105 in position space we evaluate directly from ( 40)@xmath106 from the above equation we see that @xmath104 @xmath107 and finte only if @xmath108 in this case we have@xmath109 with the relation between physical mass and coupling constant @xmath110 the @xmath40 dependence of @xmath104 is weak at large @xmath40 in comparison with dyson - schwinger equation where the order parameter vanishes fast with @xmath40[6,7,8,9,10,12].it is not difficult to test the convergence for different values of @xmath55 numerically in momentum space@xmath111 at @xmath99 we derive directly ( 55 ) provided@xmath112 we see vacuum expectation value is finite for @xmath99.this condition is independent of the bare mass.however we can not apriori determine the value @xmath113since @xmath53 is a physical mass@xmath114 and zero momentum mass @xmath115 is not the same quantity in general but we assume they have the same order of maginitude.in our model @xmath115 can be evaluated as the value of the inverse of the scalar part of the propagator at @xmath116 with @xmath117 in numerical analysis of dyson - schwinger equation @xmath115 damps fast with @xmath40 and is seen to vanish at @xmath118[6,7,8,9,10,12]@xmath119 in our approximation if we set @xmath53 equals to the value @xmath120 in ( 41 ) we obtain @xmath121 which is very close to@xmath94.for large @xmath122 remains @xmath123 but @xmath124 is @xmath125 and mass generation is suppressed.for @xmath99 we have a similar solution of the propagator at short distance which is known by the analysis of d-s.and we find the @xmath53 and @xmath115 are the same order.in the analysis of gap equation , zero momentum mass @xmath115 and a small critical number of flavours have been shown[6,7,8,9],in which same approximation was done because the vacuum polarization governs the photon propagator at low energy.the critical number of flavour @xmath126 is a consequence of the approximation for the infrared dynamics as in quenched qed@xmath127 where ultraviolet rigion is non trivial and is not easy to find numerically.for fixed value of the coupling we solved the coupled dyson - schwinger equation numerically and found that the @xmath115 which is,@xmath128 at @xmath129,the same order of magnitude as we get in the quenched landau gauge[11,12].the value of @xmath130 at @xmath129 is the same order of magnitude @xmath131 which is shown in[9].in the case of vanishing bare mass @xmath132ward - takahashi - identity for axial vector currents@xmath133 implies exisitence of a massless pole in the @xmath134where @xmath135 is a b - s amplitude for psedoscalar bound state.this is related to the propagator@xmath136 in our approximation.the scalar density @xmath137 is understood as the density of electron.@xmath138 gives the gradient energy of superfliud current.in our approximation or dyson - schwinger equation we can determine the propagator and the density of electron at the same time in the condensed phase .",
    "we evaluate the fermion propagator in three dimensional qed with dressed photon by the method of spectral function.in the evaluation of lowest order matrix element for fermion spectral function we obtain finite mass shift , coulomb energy and gauge invariant position dependent mass which has the same property in the the analysis of d - s equation.however there remains infrared divegences such as linear and logarithmic ones which were  regulaized by an infrared cut - off @xmath139including vacuum polarization we find that infrared behaviour is modified which is shown in ( 37)-(41 ) and we can avoid the infrared divergences away from threshold.this result is consistent with other analysis with dimensional regularization[4].for @xmath140 order parameter @xmath104 is finite , where we have the familiar relation of the mass and coupling constant in @xmath0 approximation.in our analysis coulomb energy at short distance is logarithmically divergent and plays the same role of mass singularity in four-dimension.this sets the renormalization constant @xmath141 for arbitrary positive value of the coupling constant.if we assume the magnitude of physical mass @xmath53 is @xmath142 in the landau gauge at @xmath129,our results is consistent with numerical analysis of coupled dyson - schwinger equation excepts for wave renormalization [ 9,12].we find the similar structure of the propagator in whole region except for @xmath40 dependence.the advantage of our approximation is to get the super - fluid density @xmath137 as well as b - s amplitude for psedoscalar @xmath143 by ward - takahashi - identity@xmath119",
