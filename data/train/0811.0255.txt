    "at high energies amplitudes of hadronic reactions with rapidity gaps are dominated by the exchange of a color singlet , @xmath0-even state  called the pomeron . in the language of perturbative qcd the pomeron can be described at lowest order as the exchange of two gluons in the color singlet state .",
    "in contrast to the very well settled notion of the pomeron , the status of its @xmath0-odd partner  the odderon  is less safe . although it is needed _",
    "e.g. _ to describe properly the different behaviors of @xmath1 and @xmath2 elastic cross sections @xcite , it still evades confirmation in the perturbative regime , where , again at lowest order , it can be described by the exchange of three gluons in the color singlet state .",
    "the difficulty is rooted in the smaller amplitude for odderon exchange in comparison to the pomeron exchange .",
    "hence , in cross sections after squaring the amplitude , the odderon contribution is always covered by the pomeron . in this contribution we study charge asymmetries in the production of two pion pairs in photon - photon collisions @xmath3 in such asymmetries , due to interference effects , the odderon amplitude enters linearly and not quadratically the observable .",
    "this approach has been initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our specific case",
    "we consider the momentum transfer @xmath4 to provide a hard scale of a few @xmath5 justifying a perturbative calculation within @xmath6-factorization since at the same time we impose @xmath7 .",
    "a sample diagram of the two gluon exchange is given in fig .  [ fig:1 ] . due to high energy factorization",
    ", the amplitudes can be expressed as convolutions of two impact factors over the transverse momenta of the exchanged gluons .",
    "the impact factors themselves consist of a perturbatively calculable part  describing the transition of a photon into a quark - antiquark pair  and a non - perturbative part , the two pion generalized distribution amplitude ( gda ) which parametrize the quark - antiquark to hadron transition .     in a sample feynman diagram of the two gluon exchange process.,height=207 ]    one key point to our final predictions is the choice of the phenomenological input : the gda @xcite which are functions of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath8 of the quark , of the angle @xmath9 ( in the same rest frame of the pion pair ) and of the invariant mass @xmath10 of the pion system . after an expansion in gegenbauer polynomials @xmath11 and in legendre polynomials @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 ) @xcite , it is believed that only the first terms give a significant contribution : @xmath14,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 can be identified with the electromagnetic pion form factor @xmath16 . for the @xmath17 component we use different models .",
    "the first model follows ref .",
    "@xcite and expresses the functions @xmath18 in terms of the breit - wigner amplitudes of the according resonances .",
    "a second model has been elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite and interprets the functions @xmath18 as corresponding omns functions for @xmath19 and @xmath20waves constructed by dispersion relations from the phase shifts of the elastic pion scattering .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the actual phases of the gda might be closer to the phases of the corresponding @xmath21 matrix elements @xmath22 . the third model for the @xmath17 component of the gda takes this into account by using the technique of model 2 with these phases @xmath23 of the @xmath21 matrix elements .",
    "indeed , measurements at hermes @xcite do not observe a resonance effect at the @xmath24-mass , but concerning the @xmath25 both phases ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) are compatible with data @xcite . having this in mind ,",
    "we consider also a fourth model  a mixed description with the @xmath24 contribution from model 3 and the @xmath25 contribution from model 2 .",
    "the gdas for @xmath0-even pion pairs ( @xmath28 ) enter the odderon exchange amplitude , while those for the @xmath0-odd pion pairs ( @xmath29 ) enter the pomeron exchange .",
    "they are orthogonal to each other in the space of legendre polynomials in @xmath30 such that only the interference term survives , when the amplitude squared is multiplied by @xmath30 before the angular integration .",
    "thereby we define a charge asymmetry in the following way : @xmath31}{\\int_{-1}^1d\\cos\\theta\\int_{-1}^1d\\cos\\theta'\\,\\left[\\left|\\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbb{p}}\\right|^2+\\left|\\mathcal{m}_{\\mathbb{o}}+\\mathcal{m}_{\\gamma}\\right|^2\\right ] } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where also the @xmath0-odd photon exchange has been included .",
    "since in the kinematic region of interest it is much smaller than the odderon contribution , the asymmetry is driven by the odderon/ pomeron - interference .    the obtained landscape as a function of the two invariant masses would be difficult to measure .",
    "to reduce the complexity , we integrate over the invariant mass of one of the two pion systems to obtain @xmath32    an analytic calculation of the odderon matrix element would demand the notion of analytic results for two - loop box diagrams , whose off - shellness for all external legs is different . with the techniques available on the market such a calculation is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "instead we rely on a numerical evaluation by monte carlo methods .",
    "in particular we make use of a modified version of vegas as it is provided by the cuba library @xcite .    although the asymmetry @xmath33 will problably not be measured , it is illustrative to display it for completeness in fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape ] .",
    "the result for the asymmetry @xmath34 at @xmath35 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymplot1 ] . since our framework",
    "is only justified for @xmath36 , ( in fact strictly speaking , one even needs @xmath37 ) , we keep @xmath10 below 1gev .     at @xmath35 for model 2 ( left ) and 3 ( right ) .",

    "we have presented charge asymmetry estimates in production of pion pairs in @xmath42 collisions .",
    "this asymmetry is linearly dependent on the odderon amplitude and moreover is sizable but gda - model dependent .",
    "hermes measurements of two pion electroproduction @xcite disfavor models with a strong @xmath24 coupling to the @xmath43 state but to our minds higher statistics data , which may come from a jlab experiment at 6 or 12gev , are needed before a definite conclusion . as we argue in ref .",
