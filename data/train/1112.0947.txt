    "topologically ordered ( to ) states are ground states of certain quantum many - body systems that exhibit an order which does not rely on symmetry - breaking mechanism , and thus can not be characterized by a non vanishing local order parameter @xcite .",
    "they possess a ground state degeneracy which depends on the topology of the underlying space and which can not be lifted by local perturbations of the hamiltonian , and a pattern of long - range entanglement .    for pure states ,",
    "we say they possess topological order if they span a degenerate ground space with a gap , and such that distinct ground states are locally indistinguishable , i.e. the reduced density matrix over any topologically trivial region does not depend on the choice of the state within the ground space @xcite .",
    "this property implies a topological robustness under local perturbations , which has made this kind of order interesting for quantum computation @xcite .",
    "this robustness property means that topological order is a property of a whole phase , and one is interested in some quantity that can label and detect this kind of order .",
    "it turns out that to states are characterized by specific entanglement properties .",
    "first , they posses an area law with a finite universal correction @xcite .",
    "this correction , called _ topological entropy _ ( te ) , has been shown to be constant within the whole to phase of the toric code @xcite , and therefore can be used as an order parameter to label the to phases .",
    "it has been shown that this quantity is also characteristic of other to phases like the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite , topological dimer phases , fractional quantum hall liquids @xcite , and to phases with finite correlation length @xcite , or other quantum states that are defined in group theoretic terms @xcite .",
    "also , these properties show up in the entanglement spectrum .",
    "to what extent which to phases can be classified using the full entanglement spectrum is still an open problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , quantum phases break in domains of quasi adiabatic continuity , namely the set of those states that can be connected by means of evolution with a local hamiltonian without closing a gap @xcite .",
    "if we ignore symmetry , all the non to states are in the same phase as the completely factorized state . in this sense ,",
    "non to states have trivial entanglement , while to states belong to different classes of non trivial , long - range entanglement @xcite .    however , a real physical system is always found at some finite temperature @xmath1 by coupling to a thermal environment and so does not occupy solely the ground state . if topological order is to be a physical phenomenon , it must therefore exist in thermal states at nonzero temperature too .",
    "we should then seek generalizations of the above characterizations of topological order to @xmath2 .",
    "the given definition , in terms of mass gap and ground - state degeneracy , fails to generalize straightforwardly as we can not speak about locally indistinguishable distinct states at @xmath2 simply because the thermal state is unique .",
    "nevertheless , we can generalize this definition through its physical implications . at zero temperature",
    ", it implies that a to system can support long - lived quantum memory . indeed ,",
    "if we add a local perturbation to a hamiltonian of such system of linear size @xmath3 , we must go to @xmath4-th order in perturbation theory to connect orthogonal ground states .",
    "hence , the tunnelling amplitude between distinct ground states is @xmath5 , in which case we obtain a quantum memory register with lifetime @xmath6 , which we call _ stable _ quantum memory .",
    "similarly , a stable classical memory is a system in which we can reliably encode classical information for exponentially long times .",
    "we can generalize this viewpoint to finite temperature by defining a topologically ordered system to be one which supports quantum memory with lifetime that scales exponentially with the size of the system .",
    "as an example , the toric code in 2d @xcite does not support any kind of memory , quantum or classical at any finite temperature @xmath2 , while the ising model in 2d and the toric code in 3d both have a critical temperature @xmath7 below which classical memory is stable @xcite .",
    "the notion of te generalizes to @xmath2 immediately@xcite . scaling of the von neumann entropy with subsystem proportions is more complicated then the area law at zero temperature , but one may take a suitable linear combination of von neumann entropies of different subsystems and isolate the universal constant piece coming from structured entanglement @xcite . for the toric code in 2d and 3d , the calculation of te at finite temperature",
    "was performed in @xcite and @xcite . in 2d",
    "there is no te at any finite temperature , just like there is no stable information . in 3d",
    ", there is a stable te of completely classical origin , just like there is a stable classical memory .",
    "this fact strongly pushes the question whether the stability of te and memory at finite temperature are always related , and if yes , why .",
    "moreover , the characterization of to as states with non trivial entanglement ( nt ) has recently been generalized to finite temperature by hastings @xcite , by considering equilibrium states that can not be connected by means of a quantum circuit of finite range to a mixed state which is made of product states in the energy eigenbasis .",
    "non to states at finite temperature do possess trivial entanglement ( fac ) .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the important question whether these three characterizations of topological order are still equivalent at @xmath2 .",
    "we study the simplest model with to , the toric code -in arbitrary @xmath8 spatial dimensions- introduced by kitaev @xcite , which in the low energy sector realizes the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "we analyze the stability of quantum memory , calculate the te and compare these results also with the presence of nt or fac as indicators of topological order .",
    "the calculation of te at arbitrary temperature in the thermodynamic limit is made possible by decomposition into contributions from the two kinds of defects @xcite and a mapping to the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory .",
    "we find the critical temperatures for the stability of te , corresponding to the confinement - deconfinement transitions of the underlying gauge theory @xcite .",
    "we find that the value of te contains all the information about stability of quantum and classical memory in these models ( and about the triviality of entanglement ) and hence that all define the same notion of topological order .",
    "so , at least in the toric code models , we see that _ quantum te means stable quantum memory , while classical te means stable classical memory_. we are also able to elucidate that the same physical mechanism is responsible for destruction of quantum memory and quantum te .",
    "the toric codes examined in this paper depend on two couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we find there are two critical temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath12 , such that the stability of memory and te are connected as follows .    * quantum memory stable and @xmath13 for @xmath14 , and nt * classical memory stable and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , and fac * no stable memory and @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and fac ,    where @xmath19 is the topological entropy at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "as usual in statistical mechanics , the existence of finite critical temperature depends on the dimensionality of the system , where low dimensional systems are less likely to have finite - temperature phase transitions .",
    "as particular cases , we recover the results of castelnovo and chamon @xcite in two and three dimensions .",
    "this precise correspondence leads us to conjecture that it holds in general to systems and hence that we may define topological order at @xmath2 as follows : a thermal state is to at @xmath2 if @xmath20 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , the general toric codes are described , together with their dualities and connections to lattice gauge theory",
    ". statistics of defects is then used to analyse the stability of quantum and classical memory in the toric codes in section [ sec : memory ] .",
    "decomposition of the topological entropy , duality of the toric codes and a map to @xmath0 lattice gauge theory lead to the calculation of te in section [ sec : entropy ] .",
    "our results are discussed and compared to hastings s circuit definition in section [ sec : discussion ] , together with suggestions for further work .",
    "the toric codes considered in this paper are labelled by a pair @xmath21 , where @xmath8 is the dimension of the lattice and @xmath22 .",
    "the toric code labelled by @xmath21 will be denoted @xmath23 and is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath24 be a @xmath8-dimensional cubic lattice of linear size @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions and let us refer to its elementary @xmath25-dimensional blocks as @xmath25-cells .",
    "let us denote @xmath26 the set of @xmath25-cells and @xmath27 the total number of 0-cells in our lattice , so that @xmath28 . to obtain @xmath23 , put a spin-@xmath29 degree of freedom on each @xmath25-cell and associate the star operator @xmath30 with each @xmath31-cell @xmath32 , where the product runs over all @xmath25-cells neigbouring @xmath32 , and plaquette operator @xmath33 with each @xmath34-cell @xmath35 , where the product runs over the @xmath25-cells contained in @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 are the local pauli spin operators .",
    "the hamiltonian of @xmath23 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath40 overlap only if @xmath32 is contained in @xmath35 , but then they share precisely @xmath41 @xmath25-cells , so that @xmath42 = [ a_a , a_{a ' } ] = [ b_b , b_{b ' } ] = 0 $ ] .",
    "hence the ground state subspace is @xmath43 .",
    "denote the dual lattice by @xmath44 .",
    "the algebra @xmath45 of operators commuting with the hamiltonian is generated by products of @xmath46 over closed @xmath47-chains in @xmath44 and products of @xmath48 over closed @xmath25-chains in @xmath24 .",
    "the algebra @xmath49 is generated by @xmath50 and @xmath51 operators and hence consists of products of @xmath46 over boundary @xmath47-chains in @xmath44 and products of @xmath48 over boundary @xmath25-chains in @xmath24 .",
    "hence the algebra of operators acting on the ground state @xmath52 is generated by products of @xmath46 over @xmath47-homologies of @xmath44 and products of @xmath48 over @xmath25-homologies of @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25th @xmath0 homology group of the @xmath8-dimensional torus is @xmath53 .",
    "it is not hard to see that there is a canonical one - to - one correspondence between the @xmath47-homologies of @xmath44 and @xmath25-homologies of @xmath24 , so that if we define the logical operators @xmath54 for @xmath55 to be the described products over homology representatives , we can choose the @xmath56 labels so that @xmath57 = 0\\quad\\textrm{if } \\alpha\\neq\\beta\\ ] ] the algebra of eq .",
    "is just the algebra of @xmath58 independent spin-@xmath29 particles , so we find @xmath59 .",
    "the information stored in the ground space is topologically protected since only products of @xmath46 and @xmath48 over surfaces with nontrivial homology act nonidentically on @xmath60 . considering a local perturbation at @xmath61",
    ", we would have to go to the @xmath4-th order in perturbation theory to get a nonvanishing matrix element between orthogonal ground states , i.e. the tunnelling amplitude is exponentially small in the size of the system .",
    "the situation is very different at @xmath2 where stability of to depends on the energy barrier for these defects to wind around the torus .",
    "the @xmath23 model is exactly dual to the @xmath62 model on the dual lattice , which will prove very useful in the following . to obtain this result , note first that each @xmath63-cell in @xmath24 intersects precisely one @xmath64-cell of @xmath44 , so if @xmath65 , let @xmath66 be the corresponding @xmath64-cell in @xmath44 . hence the spins naturally live on the @xmath47-cells of @xmath44 .",
    "we now observe that if @xmath67 and @xmath68 , then @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the boundary operator .",
    "define @xmath71 to be the unitary operator swapping globally the @xmath72 and @xmath73 computational bases . denoting @xmath74 , @xmath75 the analogous @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 operators on the dual lattice , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we find @xmath78 consequently , if @xmath79 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath62 on the dual lattice , the duality is expressed through the equation @xmath80 it follows that any thermal expectation values calculated in the @xmath23 and @xmath62 at the same temperature are connected by swapping @xmath9 and @xmath10 since the two density matrices are conjugate .",
    "the unique toric code in two dimension is the well - known @xmath81 model with star and plaquette operators , which is self - dual .",
    "it also follows that there is only one kind of a toric code in @xmath82d , since @xmath83 is dual to @xmath84 , and so we need to go to at least @xmath85d to find distinct models with equal @xmath8 .",
    "it will become clear that the most interesting @xmath85d toric code is the self - dual @xmath86 .      in the limit @xmath87 , the condition @xmath88 is enforced on all physical states @xmath89 projecting @xmath23 onto the corresponding @xmath0 pure lattice gauge theory @xcite with the hamiltonian @xmath90 and gauge constraints .",
    "let us denote this theory by @xmath91 .",
    "spin flips cause excitations , which take the form of boundary @xmath92-chains in @xmath44 .",
    "a boundary @xmath92-chain @xmath93 defines the @xmath34-chain @xmath94 of @xmath34-cells such that @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "such @xmath34-cells will be called `` flipped cells '' and @xmath94 the `` flipped chain '' in the following .",
    "duality of @xmath91 and @xmath97 for @xmath98 can be used to show that @xmath91 for this range of @xmath25s is a two - phase system @xcite , where the elitzur s theorem forbids existence of a local order parameter . in the low - temperature phase , defects , which are necessarily at least 1-dimensional for @xmath99 ,",
    "are confined , and become deconfined at a finite critical temperature .",
    "@xmath100 contains @xmath101-dimensional defects , which become deconfined already at @xmath61 , and thus the system only has the disordered phase .",
    "as noted in section [ sec : model ] , the primary interest in the toric codes stems from the capacity of the ground - state subspace to store qubits which are stable under local perturbations at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "the problem of the stability of quantum memory at finite temperature is much more delicate and of great importance for both theoretical implications and practical reasons . in the view that the resilience of quantum memory at finite temperature is a property of the phase",
    ", one would expect that it is necessary to have a critical temperature below which memory is stable @xcite .",
    "a remarkable fact of the memory encoded in the ground space of the toric codes is that their thermal stability can be studied through the confinement - deconfinement transition of the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory @xcite . in this discussion",
    ", it is important to distinguish between classical and quantum memory , which are defined as follows .",
    "a qubit is prepared in a superposition @xmath102 , and coupling with a thermal bath is switched on .",
    "let @xmath103 be the time scale at which the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix go to zero in some basis , i.e. the time at which the quantum correlations disappear .",
    "similarly , let @xmath104 be the time scale when the diagonal elements change significantly , or equivalently when one loses even the classical probabilities .",
    "we say that our system posesses quantum memory if @xmath105 , where @xmath3 is the size of the system , and only classical memory if @xmath106 and @xmath107 . finally , the system has no memory if both @xmath108 in the size of the system .",
    "the ground state subspace of @xmath23 is isomorphic to the hilbert space of @xmath58 @xmath41-level systems , and its algebra of logical operators is generated by @xmath109 for @xmath110 , which satisfy .",
    "the different @xmath56 sectors are equivalent and independent and we will restrict to @xmath111 in the following and drop the indices .",
    "let us choose a basis @xmath112 for this tensor factor of @xmath60 such that @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , prepare qubit in a superposition @xmath117 and turn on coupling with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling is assumed local and so @xmath2 will produce local defects of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "quantum memory is destroyed when the thermal defects can change the eigenvalue of either @xmath118 or @xmath119 , while classical memory is preserved when the eigenvalue of either @xmath118 or @xmath119 is robust under the thermal defects @xcite .",
    "we have seen that @xmath118 is a product of @xmath46 over a @xmath47-homology in @xmath44 and @xmath119 a product of @xmath48 over the dual @xmath25-homology in @xmath24 .",
    "hence the eigenvalue @xmath118 is fragile when the @xmath40 defects can wind around the torus . in turn , the deconfinement of these defects can be seen as the deconfined phase of the corresponding gauge theory , i.e. the deconfined phase of @xmath91 with coupling @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the eigenvalue of @xmath118 is fragile when the @xmath39 defects can conspire to produce surfaces with nontrivial homology .",
    "the @xmath120 duality tells us this happens precisely when @xmath121 with coupling @xmath9 is deconfined .",
    "we can now summarize these results in the following table    .quantum and classical memory in @xmath23 [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     in the introduction , we mentioned the recent formulation by hastings for topological order at @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a thermal state @xmath122 has to if it can not be transformed arbitrarily close to a ` classical ' state by means of local unitaries , even if we are allowed to tensor in additional local degrees of freedom . by a classical state",
    "is meant a thermal state of a local hamiltonian which is diagonal in a product basis . in @xcite , it is argued that a thermal state is topologically ordered if one can efficiently perform quantum error correction , in the sense of @xcite , since one can then thicken the logical operators @xmath118 , @xmath119 while preserving their algebraic properties .",
    "these then prevent local unitaries from conjugating the state @xmath122 arbitrarily close to a classical state . in @xmath23 , efficient correction of defects of both kinds",
    "is possible if and only if both @xmath123 and @xmath124 are in the confined phase .",
    "hastings s circuit definition , the presence of stable quantum memory and the behavior of te all agree in predicting topological order in the toric codes :    _ a system has to at @xmath2 if @xmath20 .",
    "_    we remark again that the mere presence of non - vanishing te is not enough to ensure to .",
    "indeed , there are situations for classical states in the sense of @xcite in which one can encode stable classical memory , for instance the toric code in 3d @xmath125 , in which @xmath126 see also @xcite . in order to assess to , te must have the full value that it has at zero temperature .",
    "in fact , up to half of that value can be of classical origin and therefore not related to quantum to @xcite .",
    "we want to discuss the meaning of stable classical and quantum memories from the statistical mechanics point of view .",
    "the stability of classical memory corresponds to ergodicity breaking .",
    "the phase space breaks into domains in which the evolution is confined for exponentially long ( in the system size ) times .",
    "these domains become disconnected in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one can encode classical information in the system by knowing in which domain the system is confined .",
    "a stable quantum memory means that there is a manifold of metastable quantum states .",
    "the breaking of ergodicity here is more dramatic , because there is an infinite number of states that are disconnected , and that have arbitrarily large overlap between each other .",
    "we find that this property is accompanied by a particular pattern of long - range entanglement , being it te or the non triviality of entanglement ( nt ) criterion .",
    "we asked ourselves : why is that",
    "? why should the entanglement properties be related in such a strict way to the way the system approaches equilibrium ?",
    "we think that answering this question is crucial to the understanding of the notions of quantum memory , ergodicity breaking , and the statistical mechanics of topological phases .    in this paper",
    ", we have proven that the mechanism leading to the destruction of te is given by the confinement - deconfinement transition in the corresponding gauge theory ( here the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory ) and therefore to a critical temperature @xmath7 for the stability of @xmath127 .",
    "moreover , we have proven that the same mechanism is responsible for the transition @xmath128 that describes topological order in terms of patterns of non trivial long - range entanglement . the confinement - deconfinement mechanism",
    "though , is _ also _ the one responsible for the destruction of quantum ( or classical ) memory @xcite .",
    "we can then establish that to is a property of the way ergodicity is broken , or , in information - theoretic terms , is a property of how information encoded in the system is resilient .",
    "this is important since the entanglement criteria , or other non local order parameters @xcite are hardly experimentally accessible , so we need to find other properties of to that can characterize it .",
    "this work leaves many open questions , the most natural of all is whether these results extend to general quantum double models and the corresponding discrete gauge theories .",
    "another generalization is to investigate this transition in general string - net models @xcite , though these do not correspond to a gauge theory .",
    "moreover , we have seen why we obtain a sharp phase transition when we consider partitions of infinite size . for the finite system ,",
    "there are exponentially suppressed branes that are able to see the topology of the partitions and therefore to give exponentially suppressed corrections to @xmath127 . with this in mind , we ask ourselves what is the final size scaling in order to find the critical behaviour of @xmath127 near @xmath7 ( scaling behaviour for the mutual information in to was examined in @xcite ) . would the critical exponents for @xmath127 be related to other information - theoretic quantities , that we can perhaps measure ? moreover , in the 3d case , we see that a te of classical origin corresponds to the existence of classical memory .",
    "again , we wonder , what is the connection ?",
    "is there a kind of te in all the classical phases which host a stable classical memory ?",
    "a fourth question is related to the very interesting class of models whose quantum memory at finite temperature is stable for only polynomial ( in the system size ) lifetimes .",
    "these models are obtained by coupling with a bosonic system @xcite or with other long range interactions @xcite or with hamiltonians whose excitations have fractal geometric properties @xcite .",
    "what kind of to do these models have ?",
    "what happens to their te ? and what about the hastings criterion for such systems ?",
    "along with thermal stability , the question of whether te in itself is stable in the whole to phase is still an open question in its generality , thought te is known to be stable in the @xmath0 lattice gauge theory @xcite . we know that the to phase at @xmath61 is stable because the gap will not close for arbitrary perturbations ( within a range)@xcite .",
    "if te or nt are the hallmark of to , one needs to prove they are stable too , for the same range .",
    "we hope that the results shown in this work can also be helpful for this important question .",
    "to finish , we want to mention that another important form of stability is dynamical stability after a quantum quench , that is a sudden dramatic change in the system hamiltonian .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that te is stable in the quench scenario for some particular quenches in the toric code in 2d while quantum memory is not @xcite .",
    "therefore the dynamical scenario is different , and there are no results in higher dimensions",
    ". our results in the mapping to the lattice gauge theory may prove useful to study also these scenarios .",
    "all these questions constitute an exciting challenge for the study of novel quantum phases of matter , statistical mechanics paradigms , and quantum information theory .",
    "research at perimeter institute for theoretical physics is supported in part by the government of canada through nserc and by the province of ontario through mri ."
