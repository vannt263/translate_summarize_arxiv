    "this paper was motivated by the study of simple tiling substitutions such as the substitution @xmath1 shown in figure  [ np.subs ] .    to the left of the arrows ,",
    "four prototiles are shown along with their dimensions .",
    "the larger dimension , @xmath2 , is a root of the polynomial @xmath3 .",
    "the patches to the right of the arrows show the application of the substitution @xmath1 to each prototile .",
    "the substitution @xmath1 can be applied repeatedly , to produce arbitrarily large patches of tiles .",
    "the first few applications , starting with the large square prototile , are shown in figure [ iterate.misfit ] .",
    "our interest in @xmath1 arises because its length expansion @xmath0 is not a pisot number .",
    "an algebraic integer @xmath0 is called a _ pisot number _ if @xmath4 , and all its galois conjugates @xmath5 satisfy @xmath6 . here ,",
    "@xmath0 is not pisot since its conjugate is @xmath7 .",
    "it is known that whether or not the linear expansion of a tiling substitution @xmath1 is a pisot number has implications for the tiling dynamical system that it defines .",
    "( we make the distinction between the linear expansion and the length expansion of a substitution tiling precise in section [ tilingresults ] . )",
    "solomyak proved in @xcite that a one- or two - dimensional self - similar tiling dynamical system with real linear expansion @xmath0 is weakly mixing if and only if @xmath0 is not pisot .",
    "a similar result holds for a two - dimensional self - similar tiling dynamical system with complex linear expansion @xmath8 .",
    "solomyak showed that such a dynamical system is weakly mixing if and only if @xmath9 is not a `` complex pisot '' number .",
    "however , in the two - dimensional case the proofs of these results , as well as many similar results , use the additional assumption of `` local finiteness '' ( a property that is automatic for the one - dimensional case ) . a tiling is defined to be _ locally finite _ if , up to rigid motions , it contains only finitely many two - tile configurations .    for substitution tilings",
    ", local finiteness follows from `` two - tile closure property''@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "danzer has conjectured @xcite that non - locally finite tilings may in fact be generic for certain classes of substitutions .",
    "we will show that tilings admitted by the substitution in figure  [ np.subs ] fail to be locally finite .",
    "it remains unclear the extent to which results like those in @xcite can be extended to the non - locally finite case .",
    "although some examples of non - locally finite tilings have already appeared ( see @xcite , see also @xcite ) , our example has the benefit of simplicity .",
    "it belongs to a family @xcite of tilings that can be created quite easily from any one - dimensional substitution .",
    "moreover , our proof is based on a one - dimensional method that may be of independent interest .    to see how the lack of local finiteness appears from figure  [ np.subs ] , consider figure  [ iterate.misfit ] , which shows three iterations of the large square tile . in the first iteration",
    ", we have circled a point where there is , in danzer s terminology @xcite , a  misfit situation \" .    under the inflate - and - subdivide rule @xmath1 the tiles",
    "are inflated by the linear map @xmath10 ; we can follow the circled point s location under this linear map . following the circled point through two more iterations ,",
    "we see that the misfit it creates moves around relative to the tile below it .",
    "we will prove that this point occupies infinitely many locations with respect to the tile below it .",
    "therefore the infinite tiling generated by this process is not locally finite .",
    "now one can begin to see why the arguments are one - dimensional .",
    "inspection of figure  [ np.subs ] shows that there are two kinds of upper edges : a long one and a short one , which we denote @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the reader can verify that a long upper edge is substituted by a long followed by three short edges , ( @xmath13 ) , and a short upper edge is substituted by a long one , ( @xmath14 ) . the circled point in figure  [ iterate.misfit ] is always on the corner of two of the tiles above it , but it is ( we will show ) always in the interior of an upper edge .",
    "thus we restrict our attention to the one - dimensional substitution on the upper edges to prove our result .",
    "in fact , following the misfit through these iterates is analogous to applying a suitably defined  generalized @xmath0-transformation \" , which we discuss in the next section .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first focus on the one - dimensional theory , which is itself of independent interest . in section [ definitions ] , we give the one - dimensional definition of a substitution tiling and a generalized @xmath0-transformation , and we show how they are related . in section [ onedresults ]",
    "we give conditions that guarantee finite or infinite orbits of the generalized @xmath0-transformations and relate this result to one - dimensional tilings . in section [ tilingresults ]",
    "we apply this machinery to tilings of @xmath15 .",

    "we require that @xmath22 has a real eigenvalue @xmath26 such that the right eigenvector @xmath27 has strictly positive entries .",
    "it is worth noting that perron - frobenius theory ensures this in two special cases : irreducibility and primitivity .",

    "it is the mapping from tilings to tiling patches defined by @xmath48 clearly we have @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "this allows us to extend @xmath1 to a mapping on tiling patches , and even to tilings .",
