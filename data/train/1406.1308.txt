    "a central problem in coding theory is that of determining the asymptotic performance of optimal codes when the block length is sent to infinity .",
    "mathematically , this general problem can be formalized in different ways .",
    "an example is that of determining the asymptotic minimum distance of binary codes at a given rate .",
    "another example is that of determining the largest possible rate for zero - error communication for a channel over which certain pairs of symbols can not be confused . again",
    ", another question is the determination of the asymptotic behavior of the probability of error of optimal codes at a given rate . in this paper",
    ", we consider a generalization of the first example , that is , the study of the minimum distance of codes at given rate .",
    "the proposed approach , however , borrows ideas from bounds originally developed in the context of the second example , that is bounds on the zero - error capacity of channels .    the elias bound is certainly one of the most famous bounds on the minimum distance of codes .",
    "originally developed for binary codes , it was later extended by berlekamp @xcite , blahut @xcite and piret @xcite to more general contexts and for particular distances . in this paper , we present an extension of the bound to general , possibly infinite - valued , distances . allowing infinite distances ,",
    "we handle in a unified way bounds on the minimum distance of codes and bounds on graph ( or zero - error ) capacity .",
    "in fact , we propose a method which builds upon a combination of the elias bound with the lovsz theta function to bound the minimum distance of codes even in cases where some pairs of symbols have infinite distance .",
    "the derived bound will be shown to include as special cases both the mentioned previous extensions of the elias bound and lovsz @xcite and marton s @xcite bounds on graph / zero - error capacity .",
    "the bound derived in this paper represents an evolution of some results presented in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the focus was there on the bhattacharyya distance as a mean for bounding the reliability function of channels . in deriving the new bound",
    ", we present the result with generality for an arbitrary distance .",
    "we then discuss the particular application to the bhattacharyya distance and to other distances that can be used to bound the reliability function .",
    "let @xmath0 be a discrete set and let @xmath1 be a function @xmath2 such that for all @xmath3 @xmath4 we will refer to such a function @xmath1 as a `` distance '' , although as seen above we do not really require all the properties of a distance .",
    "we stress that @xmath1 is allowed to take value @xmath5 for some pairs of symbols , a case which will be of practical interest in this paper .",

    ", we define its minimum distance as @xmath18 for a fixed rate @xmath19 and block length @xmath12 we define the optimal minimum distance as @xmath20 where the maximum is over all codes of length @xmath12 and rate at least @xmath19 .",

    "we are however also interested in bounding the minimum distance of codes with constant composition ( or _ type _ , see @xcite ) . using the notation of @xcite ,",
    "this means that there exists a distribution @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the set of sequences of length @xmath12 which contain any symbol @xmath33 exactly @xmath34 times .",

    "we can then define the @xmath52-capacity of the graph as @xmath57 note that , when specialized to @xmath58 , this definition recovers equation if distinct nodes are considered adjacent if and only if @xmath59 . in this sense",

    "one first identifies a subset @xmath88 of codewords which are all _ packed _ in a ball around a properly chosen fixed sequence @xmath89 .",

    "we first recall for the reader convenience how the approach sketched above is used in the binary case to derive the original bound stated in example [ ex : binary ] .",

    "let @xmath94 be the set of @xmath12-bit binary sequences which differ from @xmath93 in exactly @xmath95 positions .",
    "it is well known that that @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the binary entropy function defined in , and @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "hence , by symmetry , any sequence @xmath100 is contained in @xmath94 for @xmath101 sequences @xmath93 . given any code with @xmath102 codewords ,",
    "the total number of codewords counted ( with multiplicities ) in all the sets @xmath94 , as @xmath93 runs over @xmath103 , is thus @xmath104 .",
    "since there are @xmath105 sets @xmath94 , at least one of them , say @xmath106 , contains @xmath107 codewords .",
    "note that these codewords are all packed around the sequence @xmath89 since they all differ from it in exactly @xmath95 positions .",

    "we then obtain the bound @xmath123 valid for @xmath122 . by continuity of @xmath118 , we can extend the bound to the case @xmath124 .",
    "berlekamp considers two possible choices of the distance @xmath1 . assuming @xmath0 is the set @xmath125 , endowed with the usual sum mod @xmath126",
    ", berlekamp considers the hamming distance defined by @xmath127 and the lee distance defined by @xmath128 note that in all cases the distance is finite .",
    "the bound in @xcite is stated as follows .",
    "let @xmath129 be the number of sequences of length @xmath12 with distance at most @xmath1 from the sequence @xmath130 .",
    "let then @xmath131 and @xmath132 then @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the average distance of the points in @xmath0 from @xmath69 under a uniform distribution @xmath135    it is useful to rewrite berlekamp s bound in a more convenient way .",
    "note that all sequences with a given composition @xmath136 are at the same distance from @xmath137 , which is given by the expression @xmath138 since the number of different compositions of sequences in @xmath139 is polynomial in @xmath12 , the exponential grow of the quantity @xmath129 is determined by the largest composition class at distance at most @xmath1 from @xmath137 .",
    "to the first order in the exponent , there are @xmath140 sequences of composition @xmath136 , where @xmath141 is the entropy of a distribution .",
    "hence , we will have @xmath142 where @xmath136 maximizes @xmath143 over the set of compositions satisfying @xmath144 taking the limit as @xmath38 , this implies that @xmath145 where @xmath146 since @xmath147 is a convex domain and the objective function is linear , it can be verified with the use of lagrange multipliers that the optimal @xmath148 satisfies @xmath149 where @xmath150 are parameters chosen so as to satisfy the constraints on @xmath136 with equality .",
    "an important remark about this bound is that it relies only on two properties of the considered distances .",
    "the first property is that the distances are circularly symmetric , that is @xmath151 and , hence , circular permutations of the elements in @xmath0 do not change the cross - distances .",
    "the second property is that the quadratic form @xmath152 is a concave function over the simplex of distributions @xmath136 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "13.4 and eqs .",
    "( 13.63)-(13.66 ) ) ) .",
    "this requirement is essentially needed in order to apply the jensen inequality as we did to move from equation to equation in the binary case . as we will see below , this is a recurrent requirement in all versions of the elias bound and it is essentially due to the use of the plotkin bound .",
    "blahut develops his bound on the minimum distance as a tool for bounding the reliability function of discrete memoryless channels .",
    "let @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , be the transition probabilities of a discrete memoryless channel @xmath156 with input alphabet @xmath0 and output alphabet @xmath157 .",
    "blahut considers the bhattacharyya distance between symbols , defined by @xmath158 under the assumption that @xmath159 is finite , which means that the channel @xmath156 has no zero - error capacity @xcite .",
    "his bound , which applies to a particular subset of channels to be described below , in the most general form states that @xmath160 where @xmath161 is a stochastic matrix running over the set @xmath162 here , @xmath163 is the mutual information with the notation of @xcite , and @xmath164 means @xmath165 after optimization of the composition we then have @xmath166    the particular class of channels for which this bound is derived by blahut is that of the so - called non - negative definite channels studied by jelinek @xcite , which are channels for which the matrix @xmath167 with elements ( see notations and ) @xmath168 is positive semidefinite for all @xmath169 . as we will discuss later ( see lemma [ lemma : distances ] below ) , this property implies that the quadratic form in equation is concave in the distribution @xmath136 , and this is essentially the only property of the distance used in blahut s derivation .",
    "note in particular that , contrarily to berlekamp s bound , there is no algebraic structure in the alphabet and no circular symmetry of @xmath159 in the sense of , which is the reason for the more complicated resulting expression in the bound .",
    "piret considers the case where the elements of @xmath0 are uniformly spaced points on the unit circle in the plane and the distance is the squared euclidean distance . note that this is a case where the distance is explicitly assumed to be a circularly symmetric squared euclidean distance .",
    "piret s bound follows an approach which is similar to blahut s and can be stated as follows .",
    "let again @xmath146 then , for any @xmath170 we have @xmath171 again , the only properties used by piret are the circular symmetry of the distance and the concavity of the quadratic form ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.2 ) ) .",
    "the latter probably leads piret to observe that it is difficult to determine the distribution @xmath170 which gives the best bound , and he thus suggests to search heuristically for a @xmath136 which gives good bounds .",
    "interestingly , even if apparently unaware of berlekamp s approach , he conjectures that the optimal @xmath136 is the same @xmath148 defined in section [ sec : berlekampsbound ] which minimizes .",
    "a detailed discussion of the connections between berlekamp s , blahut s and piret s bounds is of interest and , to the best of the author s knowledge , has not been reported previously in the literature .",
    "we postpone such an analysis to a later section where we show that all three bounds are included as special cases in our bound .",
    "it will turn out that our bound includes blahut s one which in turn includes piret s bound , which finally implies berlekamp s one .    for the moment , instead , we discuss the fundamental common feature that has already emerged in the presentation of the bounds , which is the fact that they all rely on the concavity of the quadratic form on the simplex of probability distributions . in order to better investigate this property , we need the following lemma , whose proof is given in the appendix .",
    "[ lemma : distances ] let @xmath0 be a finite alphabet and @xmath66 a distance on @xmath0 as defined in section [ sec : notations ] .",
    "if @xmath1 is finite , then the following four statements are equivalent    1 .",

    "that is , there exist points @xmath179 in a euclidean space such that @xmath180 .",
    "this observation , which does not seem to have been made before in this context , automatically implies that not only the distance used by piret , but also those used by berlekamp and blahut are squared euclidean distances .",
    "conversely , for the same reason , since the concavity of is the only used property , berlekamp s bound applies to all circularly symmetric squared euclidean distances and blahut s bound applies to all squared euclidean distances .",
    "we note here that the hamming distance is trivially representable as a squared euclidean distance in @xmath181 using mutually orthogonal vectors . for the lee distance ,",

    "[ fig : lee - sqeuclidean ] .    for the bhattacharyya distance",
    ", finally , we observe that , as already mentioned , blahut develops his bound only for the class of non - negative channels studied by jelinek with the additional assumption that they have no zero error capacity . for these channels ,",
    "the bhattacharyya distance is finite and satisfies by definition , but it is not difficult to show that this actually implies it for all @xmath182 , since the element - wise product of positive semidefinite matrices is positive semidefinite .",
    "see also the proof of lemma [ lemma : distances ] .",
    "] the condition [ item1 ] of lemma [ lemma : distances ] .",
    "it was already observed by jelinek that the equivalence of conditions [ item1 ] and [ item2 ] in lemma [ lemma : distances ] was a known fact among algebraists ( see his comments to ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , what was apparently not noticed before in the information theory community , is the equivalence of these conditions with condition [ item4 ] of lemma [ lemma : distances ] . in particular",
    ", this implies that for jelinek s channels the bhattacharyya distance is a squared euclidean distance .",
    "we observe that jelinek also reports in his lemma 1 another `` test '' for the condition [ item2 ] in our lemma [ lemma : distances ] to be satisfied , namely - using our notation - that the matrix @xmath183 with elements @xmath184 is positive semidefinite ( see the proof of lemma [ lemma : distances ] in appendix ) .",
    "what is curious is that this property is reported by jelinek but has apparently no importance in his paper , and even if already known in the algebraic community ( see @xcite ) it was probably not much used outside , at that time . on the contrary , equation is by now a fairly well known equation in kernel based learning theory since it represents the condition for a set of points with given cross - distances to be embeddable in a euclidean space . the requirement that the matrix @xmath183 be positive semidefinite implies that it is the gram matrix of a set of vectors @xmath185 and it turns out that the vectors @xmath186 satisfy @xmath187 .",

    "this is a necessary step when considering channels with a zero - error capacity for which some pairs of symbols can not be confused .",
