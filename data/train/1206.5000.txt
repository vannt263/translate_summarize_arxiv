    "nearby galaxies come in two flavors @xcite : red quiescent galaxies ( qgs ) with old stellar populations , and blue young star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) .",
    "this color bimodality seems to be already in place at @xmath12 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , presenting also strong correlations with mass , size and morphology : sfgs are typically larger than qgs of the same mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and disk - like , whereas qgs are typically spheroids characterized by concentrated light profiles @xcite .",
    "since sfgs are the progenitors of qgs , their very - different , mass - size relations restrict viable formation mechanisms .        a major surprise has been the discovery of smaller sizes for massive qgs at higher redshifts  these compact qgs ( cqgs ) , also colloquially known as  red nuggets \" , are @xmath13 times smaller than local , equal - mass analogs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in contrast , most of the massive sfgs at these redshifts are still relatively large disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt the view that galaxy mass growth is accompanied by size growth , as suggested by the mass - size relation . in this case , to form compact qgs from sfgs , three changes are required : a significant shrinkage in radius , an increase in mass concentration , and a rapid truncation of the star formation",
    ".    proposed mechanisms to create compact spheroids from star - forming progenitors generally involve violent , dynamical processes ( @xcite ) , such as gas - rich mergers @xcite or dynamical instabilities fed by cold streams @xcite .",

    "although our analysis focuses on @xmath51 , two panels at lower redshifts are shown to illustrate the extrapolated evolutionary trends .",

    ", the number of compact qgs ( cqg ; @xmath46@xmath3510.3 ) builds up first , and only at @xmath55 we do start finding a sizable number of extended qgs .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of these galaxies are assembled at late times by both continuous migration ( quenching ) of non - compact sfgs ( bottom - left region ) and size growth of cqgs . as a result of this growth",
    ", the population of cqgs disappears by @xmath15 .",
    "simultaneously , we identify a population of compact sfgs ( csfgs ) whose number density decreases steadily with time since @xmath49 , being almost completely absent at @xmath56 .",
    "the number of csfgs makes up less than 20% of all massive sfgs , but they present similar number densities as cqgs down to @xmath57 , suggesting an evolutionary link between the two populations .",
    "an evolutionary sequence where csfgs are the progenitors of cqgs at lower redshifts is supported by the fact that csfgs first appear before cqgs at high redshift ( @xmath58 ) and then disappear before them at low redshift ( @xmath59 ) , implying that evolution is from blue through red rather than vice versa . therefore ,",
    "if we assume that csfgs would see their star formation quenched and fade at roughly constant @xmath46 , these could rapidly populate the compact quiescent region in time scales of @xmath6500  myr ( approx .",
    "one of our redshift intervals ) .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the sizes of csfgs and cqgs shows that , indeed , both populations have median effective radii slightly smaller than 1  kpc ( similar to the findings in @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the median @xmath46 of cqgs ( red arrows in figure  [ selection_diag ] ) decrease by 0.25  dex ( i.e. , increase their radii by a factor of @xmath62 ) from @xmath60@xmath393.0 to @xmath60@xmath391.4 , in agreement with previous results on the size evolution of qgs ( @xcite ) , whereas csfgs present smaller values of @xmath46 ( blue arrows ) by @xmath60.2  dex , and a weaker evolution with time .",
    "however , csfgs migrating to the red sequence are expected to slowly increase their masses with time , thus moving to higher values of @xmath46 at lower redshifts . given their median ssfr , the typical mass - doubling times for csfgs range from 0.6 to 1  gyr .",
    "this is enough to account for the observed difference in @xmath46 between csfgs and cqgs , provided that the newly formed stars do not significantly increase the galaxy radii .",
    "both cqgs and csfgs present similar surface brightness profiles , which are best represented by large srsic indices .",
    "the median values range from @xmath61 for cqgs to @xmath62 for csfgs .",
    "this means that both populations are preferentially spheroid - like , in contrast with non - compact , disk - like sfgs ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the median axis ratios of csfgs , b / a@xmath60.65 , are also consistent with spheroidal morphologies .",
    "however , cqgs present slightly smaller axis - ratios , b / a@xmath60.54 , suggesting that some of these are small flattened disks @xcite .",
    "this feature might be explained if cqgs developed an extended component surrounding the compact core , perhaps via minor mergers ( @xcite ) or regrowth of a remnant disk that survived the major merger ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these mechanisms will continue to growth these galaxies is size , eventually depopulating the compact region .    turning back to the possibility of csfgs fading into cqgs",
    ", we find that indeed csfgs present suppressed ssfrs compared to the bulk of sfgs . although at @xmath64 the majority ( @xmath66080% ) of csfgs are detected at 24@xmath22 m , yielding sfr@xmath39100200  m@xmath40/yr@xmath5 , their median ssfrs are typically @xmath60.3  dex lower than those for non - compact sfgs at the same redshift .",
    "this suggests that the star formation in the compact evolutionary stage already has started to quench .",
    "simultaneously , we find an increasing fraction of csfgs hosting x - ray detected active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at @xmath64 ( open markers in figure  [ selection_diag ] ) .",
    "this result also supports the quenching scenario , since agn seems to be connected with quenching of the star formation on time scales of a few hundred myrs @xcite .",
    "in particular , a high luminosity quasar phase ( @xmath65@xmath3510@xmath66  erg  s@xmath5 ) , associated with high black - hole accretion rates , would be particularly efficient at removing the available gas , thus stopping the star formation .",
    "using data from the deepest x - ray survey in goods - s , we find that csfgs host x - ray luminous agns 30x ( @xmath630% ) more frequently than non - compact ( @xmath67% ) ( but massive ) sfgs at @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that , at these epochs , the majority of luminous ( @xmath65@xmath3510@xmath69  erg / s ) agn are found preferentially in compact hosts , as opposed to lower redshifts , where agn are more frequent in non - compact galaxies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , ( the few ) cqgs at @xmath54 also show a high fraction of x - ray detections ( @xmath70 ) , strengthening the idea that agns might play an important role on the quenching of star formation .    note",
    "that , although point source contamination from a luminous agn could bias the structural parameters towards compact morphologies @xcite , x - ray detected galaxies do not deviate from the general trend followed by non - xray detected csfgs in figure  [ selection_diag ] , with the exception of a few extreme outliers .",
    "these agns and also those with strong sed contamination were excluded from our sample prior to the analysis described above .",
    "number density evolution of massive , @xmath0 , cqgs ( red ) and csfgs ( blue ) versus redshift .",
    "the solid red line is the best fit to the number density of cqgs .",
    "solid black lines depict the evolution of the number of csfgs required to match the observed increasing density of cqgs , assuming that the former have lifetimes of @xmath71  gyr .",
    "the error bars were computed by bootstrapping the ssfr and @xmath46 uncertainties along with terms for small number statistics and field - to - field differences .",
    "the shaded regions encompass the observed number densities when the selection thresholds in ssfr and @xmath46 are modified by @xmath720.2  dex.,width=321 ]",
    "figure  [ density ] shows the number density evolution of massive cqgs and csfgs .",
    "the best fit ( red line ) to the increasing number density of qgs can be parametrized as @xmath73a@xmath74b(1+z ) , with a@xmath391.75@xmath7510@xmath76 and b@xmath39 - 6.75@xmath7510@xmath76 .",
    "assuming that all cqgs at a given redshift @xmath77 come from csfgs , we can estimate how many of the latter we should observe at @xmath78 . to do so",
    ", we propose a simple evolutionary model that assigns to all sfgs an arbitrary lifetime for their current burst of star formation , @xmath79 , after which they will become quiescent .",
    "the number of cqgs at a given time would be :    @xmath80    we explore @xmath81 values from 0.3  gyr to 1.0  gyr , similar to the typical e - folding times expected for sfgs at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "the observed number density of csfgs is broadly consistent with the model prediction for a median value of @xmath81@xmath6800  myr .",
    "this simple model assumes , that at every step , @xmath81 , enough csfgs are being formed by some mechanism(s ) , restoring the ones that turned into cqgs .",
    "plausible mechanisms to reduce the size of massive ( larger ) sfgs are gas - rich dissipational processes , such as mergers or dynamical instabilities .",
    "these can produce compact , star - bursting remnants that would likely quench in a short period of time ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . without relying on mergers being the main or sole driver of this transformation",
    ", we can make a quantitative estimate of the number of csfgs assembled by this mechanism by using typical numbers for major mergers at these redshifts .",
    "considering pair fractions of roughly 10% @xcite , merger time scales of 1  gyr ( @xcite ) and a density of massive galaxies of @xmath82  mpc@xmath53 ( @xcite ) , we obtain an assembly rate for new csfgs via mergers of @xmath83@xmath610@xmath76  gyr@xmath5 , which is roughly consistent with the observed densities for the predicted @xmath81 .    in this model ,",
    "the significant decrement on the number csfgs by @xmath56 implies that the formation mechanism(s ) become quickly inefficient at lower redshifts , thereby truncating the formation of new csfgs and thus cqgs .",
    "this gradual decline of the efficiency of the dissipational processes may follow the decline in the amount of available gas in dark matter haloes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "detailed comparisons to cosmological models will allow tests of this hypothesis and provide a more rigorous modeling of the number density evolution ( porter et al . , in prep ) .",
    "also , a follow up survey of csfgs at @xmath843 will place better constraints on the formation scenario for these galaxies ( c. williams et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "schematic view of a two path ( fast / slow track ) formation scenario for qgs . on the fast track , a small fraction of the massive sfgs at @xmath8 evolve ( e.g. , through gas - rich dissipational processes ) to a compact star - bursting remnant .",
    "then , the star formation is quenched in @xmath6800  myr ( perhaps by agn and/or supernovae feedback ) , and galaxies fade into cqgs . once in the red sequence ,",
    "cqgs grow envelopes , over longer time scales , de - populating the compact region by z@xmath61 . simultaneously , at @xmath11 , other ( slower ) mechanisms have already started to populate the red - sequence with normal - sized , non - compact qgs ( formed by , e.g. , secular processes , halo quenching , or gas - poor mergers),width=321 ]    using the deepest data spanning from the x - ray - to - mir , along with high resolution imaging from candels in goods - s and uds , we analyze stellar masses , sfrs and sizes of a sample of massive ( @xmath0 ) galaxies at @xmath85 to identify a population of csfgs with similar structural properties as cqgs at @xmath3 .",
    "the csfg population is already in place at @xmath14 , but it completely disappears by @xmath56 .",
    "a corresponding increase in the number of cqgs during the same time period suggests an evolutionary link between them .    a simple duty - cycle argument , involving quenching of the star formation activity on time scales of @xmath86  gyr , is able to broadly reproduce the evolution of the density of new qgs formed since @xmath37 in terms of fading csfgs . under this assumption",
    ", we also need to invoke a replenishment mechanism to form new csfg via gas - rich dissipational processes ( major mergers or dynamical instabilities ) , that then become quickly inefficient at @xmath87 , as the amount of available gas in the halo decreases with time ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    during the transformation processes , the compact phase is probably associated with : enhanced ( probably nuclear and dusty ) star formation , the presence of an agn , and sometimes a short - lived quasar , followed by a decline of the star formation in @xmath61  gyr @xcite .",
    "all these phenomena fit with the observed properties of csfgs presented in this letter .",
    "csfgs present no visible traces of mergers , but they do show lower ssfrs than the bulk of massive sfgs , presumably being at different stages of the starburst to passive evolution .",
    "simultaneously , @xmath630% of them host luminous ( @xmath88erg  s@xmath5 ) x - ray detected agns at @xmath64 , suggesting that these might be playing a role in the quenching of star formation .",
    "our observations connect two recent results at @xmath57 : a population of compact ( @xmath89 ) galaxies with enhanced star formation activity @xcite and an increasing fraction of small , post - starburst galaxies recently arrived on the red sequence @xcite .",
    "the emerging picture suggests that the formation of qgs follows two evolutionary tracks , each one dominating at different epochs ( as illustrated in figure  [ cartoon ] ) . at @xmath3 the formation of qgs proceeds on a fast track ( right - region ) : from @xmath90 , the number of cqgs builds up rapidly upon quenching of csfgs at roughly constant @xmath46 .",
    "merely 2  gyrs later ( @xmath15 ) , cqgs almost completely disappear due to : 1 ) size growth as a result of minor mergers satellite accretion ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or the re - growth of a remnant disk ( @xcite ) which causes them to leave the compact region ; 2 ) a decrement in the efficiency of the formation mechanisms for new csfgs , and therefore new cqgs . by @xmath11 ,",
    "other ( probably slower ) mechanisms start to populate the red sequence with larger , non - compact , qgs without passing through a compact state .",
    "this slow track ( left region ) is likely associated with the fading of normal disk galaxies to become s0s , due to halo quenching @xcite or morphological quenching @xcite .",
