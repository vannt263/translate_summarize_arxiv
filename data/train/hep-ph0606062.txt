    "grand unified theories ( guts ) are considered to be among the most appealing scenarios for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "qualitatively they always predict ( i ) unification of gauge couplings of the standard model and ( ii ) proton decay .",
    "the first feature can not be directly probed since unification takes place at a very high energy scale  the so - called gut scale .",
    "however the second feature _ can _ be probed and it offers the only realistic way of testing grand unification .",
    "it is thus important to single out and investigate viable models of grand unification ; where proton decay is not only well predicted , but also experimentally accessible in both current and future proton decay experiments .    out of all grand unified theories",
    "the scenarios based on @xmath0 gauge symmetry are arguably the most predictive ones for proton decay .",
    "recall , of all simple gauge groups that allow sm embedding only @xmath0 has unique single - step symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "this allows rather accurate determination of high energy scales relevant for proton decay .",
    "and , in its non - supersymmetric version , @xmath0 gut avoids uncertainties pertaining to the exact nature as well as the relevant scale of supersymmetry breaking ; both of those features are yet to be established experimentally .",
    "moreover , it simplifies the discussion on the dominant source(s ) of proton decay .",
    "all these appealing properties single out non - supersymmetric @xmath0 as the theory for proton decay .",
    "we accordingly focus our attention on its simplest realistic realizations .",
    "our starting point is the @xmath0 model proposed long ago by h.  georgi and s.  glashow  @xcite .",
    "their model offers partial matter unification by accommodating @xmath5th generation of matter fields in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 dimensional representations .",
    "the scalar sector is composed of a @xmath2 dimensional higgs representation and a @xmath1 dimensional higgs multiplet .",
    "the sm singlet in @xmath2 breaks @xmath0 symmetry down to the standard model , while the sm @xmath8 doublet in @xmath1 accomplishes electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the model , however , is not realistic ; the gauge couplings do not unify , neutrinos are massless and @xmath9 at the gut scale .",
    "there are two possible model building approaches that lead to simple yet realistic extensions of the georgi - glashow ( gg ) model in view of generation of realistic charged fermion masses .",
    "one approach is to allow for higher - dimensional operators which modify bad mass relations @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "that approach requires no additional higgs fields to be introduced to fix those relations . and",
    ", the strength of required corrections in the charged sector might allow one to place an upper bound on the scale where the uv completion of the unified theory takes place .",
    "of course , in order to improve unification more split representations need to be present .",
    "the other approach is to stick with renormalizable operators .",
    "the latter approach requires addition of a @xmath3 dimensional higgs multiplet .",
    "( recall that the tensor product @xmath10 . ) within that approach , as far as the neutrino masses are concerned , one can either introduce some fermion singlets  the right - handed neutrinos  or a @xmath4 dimensional higgs representations ( or both ) .",
    "the simplest non - renormalizable model based on @xmath0 has been subject of a recent investigation  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the model , with the higgs sector composed of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 , can be tested at future proton decay experiments and at future collider experiments , for example at lhc .",
    "the first possibility is due to existence of an upper bound on the proton decay lifetime .",
    "namely , @xmath11years , where @xmath12 is the nucleon matrix element .",
    "the second one is based on potential production of light leptoquarks  @xcite .",
    "see reference  @xcite for the study of several phenomenological and cosmological issues in this context .    in this work",
    "we want to investigate the minimal extension of the georgi - glashow model within the renormalizable framework .",
    "namely , we want to study predictions of a model with the higgs sector made out of @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 representations .",
    "we initially assume that the matter sector contains right - handed neutrinos to generate neutrino masses through the type - i see - saw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "however , we also discuss the case when there is an extra @xmath4 dimensional representation that generates neutrino mass via type - ii see - saw  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section i we describe the minimal renormalizable @xmath0 and consequently study the unification constraints . in section",
    "ii we compare different scenarios based on @xmath0 and discuss possibility to test them . in the last section we summaries our results .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal renormalizable @xmath0 is composed of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 dimensional representations .",
    "their sm @xmath13 decomposition is given by : @xmath14 where we also set our notation .",
    "the yukawa potential for charged fermions read as : @xmath15 where the field @xmath3 satisfies the following conditions : @xmath16 in this model the masses for charged fermions are given by : @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are arbitrary @xmath23 matrices .",
    "( note the georgi - jarlskog  @xcite factor in eq .",
    "( [ gj ] ) . ) clearly , there are enough parameters in the yukawa sector to fit all charged fermions masses . for previous studies in this context",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "now , let us understand the unification constraints within this model .",
    "necessary conditions for the successful gauge coupling unification can be expressed via two equalities .",
    "( see reference  @xcite for details . )",
    "these are @xmath24 where all experimentally measured quantities on the right - hand sides are to be taken at @xmath25 energy scale .",
    "the first one is the so - called `` b - test '' and the second one is the `` gut scale relation '' . in what follows we use  @xcite @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 to obtain : @xmath29 the left - hand sides , on the other hand , depend on particular particle content of the theory at hand and corresponding mass spectrum .",
    "more precisely , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 coefficients are given by : @xmath32 @xmath33 are the sm coefficients while @xmath34 are the one - loop coefficients of any additional particle @xmath35 of mass @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "( recall , for the case of @xmath38 light higgs doublet fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . )",
    "relevant @xmath42-coefficient contributions in our scenario are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".[table1 ] contributions to the @xmath42 coefficients .",
    "the masses of the higgs doublets are taken to be at @xmath25 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     there are two fields in @xmath4 that can improve unification ; these are @xmath43 and @xmath44 . @xmath43",
    "has very small contribution to @xmath45 and very large contribution to @xmath46 .",
    "this means that its impact on the gut scale is not significant .",
    "@xmath44 , on the other hand , has large impact on the gut scale relation but , in general , it mediates proton decay and it is probably better to keep it heavy .    in any case",
    ", the @xmath47 contribution to the running of the gauge couplings is crucial to achieve high scale unification in agreement with experimental data .",
    "if its contribution to the decay of the proton is set to zero by additional symmetry the unification scale could be very large .",
    "therefore , since in that case the most important contributions to the decay of the proton are the gauge @xmath48 ones , we can conclude that proton could be _ stable _ for all practical purposes in the minimal renormalizable @xmath0 .      as we discussed in previous sections",
    "there are two simple candidates for unification based on @xmath0 . in the first scenario the higgs sector is composed of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 , and higher - dimensional operators are used to modify the relation @xmath9",
    "let us call this model gut - i .",
    "the second scenario is the one discussed in this work  the renormalizable model with a higgs sector composed of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "let us call this gut - ii .",
    "there are two possibilities to test the gut - i  @xcite .",
    "one is through proton decay in the current and next generation of experiments and the other is through the production of light leptoquarks in future colliders . in this work",
    "we have concluded that gut - ii model can not be tested through proton decay since the lifetime of the nucleon could be very large .",
    "therefore , we can say that the only gut candidate based on @xmath0 which can be falsified in the near future is the model presented in reference  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the possibility to achieve unification without supersymmetry in a minimal realistic grand unified theory based on @xmath0 , where the higgs sector is composed of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 dimensional representations .",
    "we have pointed out that the proton could be practically stable in this scenario .",
    "we have accordingly concluded that the best candidate to be tested is the gut model with @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 dimensional representations in the higgs sector .",
