    "<S> another way to characterize the deviation from scale invariance , analogous to the `` trace anomaly '' in quantum field theory , is to rewrite ( [ gamma1 ] ) as as @xmath150 , where @xmath151 describes the scaling of the coupling @xmath20 with respect to the momentum scale @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath153 while @xmath154 , reflecting the difference between the logarithmic and power - law dependence on the density in @xmath0 and @xmath6 respectively . in both the bcs ( @xmath155 ) and bec ( @xmath156 ) regions , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 beta function is much smaller than its @xmath6 counterpart .    finally , </S>",
    "<S> using the sum rules ( [ zetasumrule2 ] ) and ( [ subtracted - sum - rule ] ) , we discuss the damping of the monopole mode , controlled by @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> although a small value for the sum rule by itself does not rigorously upper - bound @xmath86 , any physically reasonable functional form for the spectral function ( e.g. , a drude form for @xmath157 ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zetafig ] ) would lead to a very small value for @xmath121 . </S>",
    "<S> we see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sumrulefig ] that in the bcs regime @xmath158 , the sum rule @xmath159 in both @xmath0 and in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we would thus expect a very small @xmath160 here in both @xmath0 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this sum rule is quite large on the bec side and does not lead to any restriction on @xmath86 . from the low - energy sum rule ( [ subtracted - sum - rule ] ) , however , we see that the large value of @xmath161 in the bec limit is entirely dominated by the high - energy tail on scales larger than the dimer binding energy . </S>",
    "<S> once this is subtracted out , the low - energy integrated spectral weight , equal to @xmath4 , is very small even in the bec regime ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zetafig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus in @xmath0 , we expect the bulk viscosity @xmath86 to be very small both in the bcs and in the bec regimes .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions_we have shown that the parameter @xmath3 controls the deviation of the breathing mode frequency @xmath33 from its scale - invariant value @xmath13 and also quantifies the low - energy spectral weight for excitations that break scale invariance , using an exact sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that @xmath0 is special , with a coupling that depends logarithmically on density , leading to a very small @xmath4 , even in the bec regime where scale invariance is strongly broken by the large dimer binding energy ( and hence @xmath162 is large ) . </S>",
    "<S> the small @xmath4 also implies , via the @xmath0 sum rule , weak damping of the monopole mode in both the bcs and bec regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the regime very near @xmath163 deserves further theoretical and experimental investigation , but the available evidence suggests that @xmath4 might be small there as well .    _ </S>",
