    "collective properties of interacting units have been traditionally studied considering that each of these units has a property or state , and interacts with others in a network of interactions .",
    "the result of the interaction depends on the state of the interacting units . for example , in a spin system in a lattice , there is a spin in each node with a given state and it interacts with its neighbors in the lattice , in a way that depends on their relative spin state . the same basic set up has been implemented in individual or agent based models of social collective properties @xcite .",
    "these models endow individuals with a variable , which can be discrete or continuous , describing for example , an opinion state .",
    "the model also prescribes a dynamical rule , which results in changes of the states of the agents that depend on the state of the agents with whom they interact .",
    "however , there is a number of possible interactions among individuals in which the state variable is more properly described as a state of the interaction link than a state of the individuals in interaction .",
    "this is specially the case for relational interactions such as friendship , trust , communication channel ( phone or skype ) , method of salutation ( kiss or handshake ) , etc .",
    "it is also the case in language competition dynamics @xcite : so far language has been modeled in this context @xcite as an individual property , but use of a language , as opposed to knowledge of a language , is more a link than a node property in a social network of interactions .",
    "noteworthy , data on link states associated with trust , friendship or enmity , obtained from on - line games and on - line communities , is now available and has been recently analyzed @xcite . + social balance theory @xcite is a well established precedent in the study on link states and link interactions .",
    "this theory states that a relation can be positive or negative and that there is a natural tendency to avoid unbalanced triads of individuals , where an unbalanced triad is defined as one for which the multiplication of the states of the three links is negative .",
    "a number of recent studies address social balance in complex networks , implementing stochastic link dynamics that explore when a balanced situation is or is not reached asymptotically @xcite .",
    "social balance theory has also been confronted with large scale data @xcite , and alternative theories for the interaction of positive / negative relations have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "focusing on link properties has also been emphasized in the problem of community detection in complex networks @xcite .",
    "this opposes the traditional view of identifying network communities with a set of nodes @xcite , and it makes possible for an individual to be assigned to different communities . finally , the idea of considering link dynamics is also present in the problem of network dynamics controllability @xcite . here",
    "the aim is to identify the most relevant links to drive the system to a desired global state of the network , instead of focusing on the dynamically most influent nodes @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to investigate a prototype model for the dynamics of link states in a fixed network .",
    "links can be in two equivalent states .",
    "this departs from the positive / negative interactions , considered for example in social balance , where the two link states play different roles .",
    "equivalent link states can occur in many relational interactions including , for example , salutation or competition of languages of the same prestige . as a first step towards the characterization of such link dynamics we choose to investigate a majority rule dynamics akin to a zero - temperature kinetic ising model but for the states of the links , instead of the state of the nodes .",
    "we show that such link majority rule dynamics on complex networks results in a variety of non - trivial different asymptotic configurations which are generally not found when studying traditional node - dynamics in the same topologies .",
    "we also show how a quantity characterizing the node behavior naturally arises for the link states , so that nodes can also be characterized by the state of the links connected to the node .",

    "this results in an increased cliqueness of the line graph , as compared to the original network .",
    "such cliqueness is behind the topological traps that give rise to the wide range of possible asymptotic configurations that we find for the link - dynamics .",
    "in addition , the mapping of a hub of the original network in the corresponding line - graph also helps understanding the different role played by hubs in node or link - based dynamics : as discussed in section iv , hubs tend to freeze link states in their neighborhood .",
    "+ the link heterogeneity index is a useful way of characterizing nodes in a given link configuration .",

    "state @xmath4 or @xmath5 characterizes the language used in a given interaction between two individuals , and the link heterogeneity index is a natural measure of the degree of bilingualism of each individual ( node ) .",

    "consideration of the coevolution of link and node states is a natural framework that emerges in the study of collective behavior of interacting units . in physical terms , the states of the interacting particles are coupled to the state of the field that carries the interaction .",
    "another possible avenue of research is the addition of more realistic features to the model , such as the temporal patterns of human interactions @xcite , which introduces heterogeneity in the activation of different links .",
