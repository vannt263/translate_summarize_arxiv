    "it is well established that the mean - field description of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in a deep optical lattice can be reduced , starting from the one - dimensional ( 1d ) gross - pitaevskii equation with the cubic nonlinearity , to the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation @xcite . however , while the dnls equation with the cubic on - site nonlinearity readily predicts solitons @xcite , it can not describe the dynamical collapse , which is often observed experimentally in the self - attractive bec @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in the general case , the reduction of the 3d gross - pitaevskii equation for the bec trapped in a cigar - shaped `` configuration to the 1d form leads , instead of the naive '' cubic schrdinger equation , to ones with a nonpolynomial nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "such models are useful in various settings , making it possible to obtain results in a relatively simple form , which compare well to direct simulations of the underlying 3d equations @xcite . in particular",
    ", the version of this model corresponding to the combination of the tight transverse trap and strong optical - lattice potential acting in the longitudinal direction takes the form of the discrete nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ( dnpse ) , which was introduced recently @xcite .",
    "an essential property of both the continual nonpolynomial equation and its discrete counterpart is that they make it possible to model the collapse .",
    "a new variety of the bec dynamics , dominated by long - range ( nonlocal ) interactions , occurs in dipolar condensates , which can be composed of magnetically polarized @xmath0cr atoms , as demonstrated in a series of experimental works @xcite . in particular , the dipole - dipole ( dd ) attraction in the condensate",
    "may give rise to a specific @xmath1-wave mode of the collapse @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath0cr condensate can be efficiently stabilized against the collapse , adjusting the scattering length of the contact interaction by means of the feshbach - resonance ( fr ) technique @xcite .",
    "another theoretically analyzed possibility is to create a condensate dominated by dd interactions between electric dipole moments induced in atoms by a strong external dc electric field @xcite .",
    "a similar situation may be realized in bec formed by dipolar molecules hetmol . in particular ,",
    "recent experimental work @xcite has reported the creation of lics dipolar molecules in a mixed ultracold gas .",
    "a possibility of making 2d solitons in dipolar condensates was predicted in several works . in particular , isotropic solitons @xcite and vortices",
    "@xcite may exist if the sign of the dd interaction is inverted by means of rapid rotation of the dipoles @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "stable anisotropic solitons can be supported by the ordinary dd interaction , if the dipoles are polarized in the 2d plane @xcite .",
    "solitons supported by nonlocal interactions were also predicted and realized in optics , making use of the thermal nonlinearity @xcite",
    ".    a natural extension of the consideration of the dipolar bec includes a strong optical lattice potential , which leads to the discrete model with the long - range dd interactions between lattice sites @xcite . in particular ,",
    "1d unstaggered solitons in this model with the cubic on - site nonlinearity were studied in ref .",
    "it was shown that the dd interactions might enhance the solitons stability .",
    "this conclusion suggests a possibility of suppressing the collapse by means of the long - range dd forces , but the study of the collapse is not possible in the discrete system with the cubic nonlinearity .",
    "the objective of the present work is to introduce the dd interaction into dnpse model and analyze the effects of the long - range interactions between dipoles localized at site of the discrete lattice on the soliton s collapse in the sufficiently dense self - attractive condensate trapped in the deep optical lattice potential .",
    "we here focus on unstaggered solitons , leaving the consideration of staggered ones for another work .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . the discrete model including the on - site nonpolynomial nonlinearity and long - range dd interactions is formulated in section ii .",
    "results for on - site and inter - site  solitons , including the study of their stability , and the possibility of the collapse onset , are presented in section iii .",
    "the mobility of discrete solitons in the dnpse model is also briefly considered in section iii .",
    "the paper is concluded by section iv .",

    "it is worthy to note that the difference between the @xmath55 curves for the on - site and inter - site solitons vanishes as the attractive dd interaction strengthens .    in the case of the repulsive dd interaction , the @xmath55 curves for on - site and inter - site",
    "solitons are completely separated , see fig . [ fig1](d ) .",
    "actually , the slope of @xmath55 curves for both on - site and inter - site solitons tends to be very small in this case , which makes the application of the slope criterion doubtful . in these areas ,",
    "the solitons feature the amplitude close to the upper limit admitted by the model , @xmath63 , and a very small width , corresponding to a situation when nearly all atoms are collected in a single well of the underlying potential lattice .",

    "the collapse condition , @xmath63 , is attained at the black solid line , which is , simultaneously , a stability border . in direct simulations ,",
    "the on - site solitons which are predicted to be stable survived as long as the simulations ran [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] , while the solitons classified as unstable ones suffered the collapse ( destruction of the solution after attaining the level of @xmath63 ) in a finite time .",
    "on the other hand , all inter - site solitons are unstable , as the spectrum of eigenvalues for small perturbations around them always contains real eigenvalues .",
    "however , unstable inter - site solitons which have stable on - site counterparts with the same norm avoid the collapse , evolving into robust breathers oscillating around the corresponding stable on - site solitons , as shown in fig . [",

    "unstable inter - site solitons do collapse if no stable on - site soliton with the same norm can be found , see fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) .",
    "therefore , the border line for the collapse of the inter - site solitons coincides with the stability border for on - site solitons in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    for the repulsive dd interaction , the spectral stability condition for all inter - site solitons does not hold either .",
    "because , in this case , curves @xmath66 for the inter - site and on - site solitons are strongly separated [ fig.[fig1](d ) ] , unstable inter - site solitons do not find stable on - site counterparts with the same norm , therefore they suffer the collapse .",
    "as for the on - site solitons , there exists a region where the spectral stability condition holds for them .",
    "this region expands as the repulsive dd interaction gets stronger , although the respective curve @xmath55 becomes almost horizontal , and the slope condition can not be accurately verified .",
    "direct numerical simulations confirm the predictions of the stability analysis for the on - site solitons in this case too .      in this case , the slope condition is satisfied for all on - site solitons in the absence of the dd interaction ( @xmath67 ) , see fig . [",

    "as the strength of the attractive dd interaction grows , a pair of subfamilies emerge , the slope - stable and unstable ones , the respective @xmath55 curves being similar to those observed in the case of the strong coupling , @xmath57 [ fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] . eventually , when the attractive dd interaction becomes dominant , the region where the slope condition is satisfied spreads over the entire parameter space , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) .    in the model with @xmath58 , all inter - site solitons again satisfy the slope condition . with the strengthening of the dd interaction , the separation between the @xmath55 curves for the on - site branch , which satisfies the slope condition , and",
    "its inter - site counterpart vanishes . on the other hand , in the case of the repulsive dd interaction , the corresponding @xmath55 curves for on - site and inter - site soliton families",
    "are strongly separated , see fig . [ fig4](d ) .",
    "results of the stability analysis for the on - site solitons are summarized in the stability diagram displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) in parametric space @xmath68 . unlike the case of @xmath57 , cf",
    "[ fig2 ] , in the present case there appears a region where the spectral stability condition is violated for on - site solitons as the dd interaction grows stronger , as well as a region where the stability condition holds for inter - site solitons .",
    "these regions disappear again with the further growth of @xmath31 .",
    "also in contrast to the case of @xmath57 , the line at which the collapse is attained in the family of on - site solitons _ does not _ coincide with the border between stable and unstable parts of the family .",
    "rather , the collapse line passes trough the unstable region where the spectral - stability condition does not hold , see fig . [",
    "fig5](a ) .",
    "direct simulations demonstrate that unstable on - site solitons which have stable inter - site counterparts with the equal norm evolve into breathers oscillating around the stable counterparts . on the other hand ,",
    "if unstable on - site solitons can not find stable inter - site counterparts with the same ( or close ) value of the norm , they undergo the collapse .",
    "in fact , the existence of the two different scenarios of the instability development  the formation of the breather and collapse  explains the above - mentioned fact that the collapse line does not coincide with the instability border . in the present case too , direct simulations corroborate the stability of those solitons which do not have unstable eigenvalues .",
    "extending the above - mentioned trend , unstable inter - site solitons which have stable on - site counterparts with the same norm evolve into persistent breathers , while those unstable solitons that are devoid of stable equal - norm counterparts suffer the collapse .",
    "accordingly , the line at which the collapse is attained does not coincide with the instability border , as seen in fig . [",
    "fig5](b ) .",
    "it is worthy to note the existence of a stability region for inter - site solitons in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) which is adjacent to the collapse line . in the latter case ,",
    "the stable inter - site solitons do not have on - site counterparts with the same value of the norm .    for the repulsive dd interactions , the spectral stability condition always holds for on - site solitons and does not hold for inter - site modes , similar to the case of @xmath57",
    "again , in some part of the parameter space , the corresponding @xmath55 curves for the on - site solitons are nearly horizontal lines with zero slope , being completely separated from the @xmath69 line for the inter - site modes .",
    "direct simulations demonstrate that the on - site solitons are indeed stable in this case , while the unstable inter - site solitons undergo the collapse .",
    "if the local interaction is repulsive , the existence of the unstaggered solitons may only be supported by the attractive dd interaction . in the model with the self - repulsive cubic on - site nonlinearity ,",
    "unstaggered solitons were found only when the relative strength of the attractive dd interaction was large enough , @xmath70 @xcite . in the present model , unstaggered solitons ( with large amplitudes )",
    "are obtained for smaller values of @xmath31 as well",
    ". nevertheless , general results obtained in the present model for the case of the local repulsion are not drastically different from those reported in the model with the cubic on - site nonlinearity in ref .",
    "in particular , differences between @xmath55 curves for on - site and inter - site solitons are small at all values of @xmath60 , the slope condition is always satisfied for both types of the solitons , and there is an exchange between regions where the spectral stability condition is fulfilled for on - site and inter - site solitons .",
    "further , unstable solitons evolve into breathers oscillating around their stable counterparts .",
    "the similarity of these results for discrete solitons in the present dnpse model and its cubic counterpart is not surprising , as in the case of the local repulsion ( unlike attraction ) there is no dramatic difference between the nonpolynomial and cubic nonlinearities , therefore the competition of the local term of either type ( nonpolynomial or cubic ) with the dd attraction gives rise to similar solitary modes .",
    "finally , we briefly summarize results concerning mobility of localized modes , with respect to the concept of the peierls - nabarro barrier mobil . to this end",
    ", we follow the lines of the analysis developed in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "examination of the mobility has shown that the peierls - nabarro barrier in the dnpse model depends on the strength of the dd interaction in the same way as it was in the discrete model with the cubic on - site nonlinearity .",
    "namely , in the case of the local attraction , the repulsive or attractive dd interaction decreases or increases , respectively , a region in plane @xmath71 where mobile localized modes can be found . on the other hand , in the case of the contact repulsion",
    ", all localized modes can be set in motion by an initial kick , regardless of the value of dd coefficient @xmath31 . in all cases when mobile discrete solitons exist , the vanishing of the peierls - nabarro barrier coincides with the disappearance of the separation between @xmath55 curves for the on - site and inter - site soliton families , cf .",
    "refs . @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work was to achieve a better understanding on the influence of the long - range dd ( dipole - dipole ) interactions on the stability and collapse of localized nonlinear modes in the cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate trapped in a deep optical - lattice potential . to this end",
    ", we have introduced the model based on the one - dimensional dnpse ( discrete nonpolynomial schrdinger equation ) , which includes the contact ( on - site ) and dd nonlinear terms .",
    "both attractive and repulsive signs of the contact and dd interactions were considered .",
    "the main conclusion is that the presence of the attractive dd interaction enhances the soliton s stability and helps to prevent the collapse .",
    "our analysis was limited to unstaggered solitons , the consideration of staggered localized modes being a subject of a separate work .",
