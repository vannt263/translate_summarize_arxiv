    "let @xmath2 be an algebraically closed field .",
    "a _ tube category _ @xmath3 of rank @xmath4 over @xmath2 can be defined as the category of finite dimensional nilpotent representations of an oriented @xmath4-cycle over @xmath2 .",
    "we introduce a geometric model of such a category using an annulus with @xmath4 marked points on the outer boundary and none on the inner boundary .",
    "the indecomposable objects of @xmath3 are in bijection with certain oriented arcs in the annulus , i.e.  those which are oriented anticlockwise and which are not homotopic to a boundary arc between successive marked points ; we refer to them as admissible arcs .",
    "the ar - quiver of the tube can be realised via the geometry of the arcs .",
    "we then show that :    [ t : mainresult ] let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be admissible arcs in an annulus with @xmath4 marked points on its outer boundary , and let @xmath7 and @xmath8 be the corresponding indecomposable objects in a tube @xmath3 of rank @xmath4 .",
    "then the dimension of @xmath9 coincides with the minimal number of negative crossings between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "cluster categories were introduced in  @xcite ( and in  @xcite for type @xmath7 ) in order to model the cluster algebras  @xcite of fomin - zelevinsky .",
    "they have since been used widely in representation theory ( see e.g.  @xcite for a survey ) . since",
    "a tube is skeletally small it follows from keller s theorem  @xcite that the cluster category @xmath10 associated to a tube ( which we call a cluster tube ) is triangulated ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite ) . we show that the minimal number of crossings between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is equal to the sum of the minimal number of positive crossings and the minimal number of negative crossings .",
    "this total number coincides with @xmath11 .",
    "we thus obtain a geometric interpretation of the fact that @xmath12 ( which can be proved as in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.7 ) ) for indecomposable objects @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath3 , where @xmath13 .",
    "we also show that similar results hold for the category of finite dimensional representations of the linear orientation of the quiver @xmath1 , a hereditary category whose ar - quiver is of type @xmath14 .",
    "we note that geometric models of cluster categories and of the generalised cluster categories of amiot  @xcite use unoriented arcs in marked riemann surfaces : see  @xcite .",
    "such models were used for cluster algebras in  @xcite .",
    "our perspective here is that by using oriented arcs we can model the classical categories @xmath3 arising in representation theory .",
    "the @xmath15-calabi - yau @xmath16-symmetry of the cluster category then arises by forgetting the orientation on the arcs .",
    "we note that oriented arcs have also been used in  @xcite to obtain a geometric model for the root category  @xcite of type @xmath7 ( the quotient of the bounded derived category by the square of the shift ) .",
    "we remark that  @xcite and  @xcite give a construction of the ar - quiver of a cluster tube ( in the latter case , as a subcategory of a generalised cluster category ) using unoriented arcs in an annulus .",
    "also , it follows from  @xcite that if the intersection number of two admissible arcs in the annulus is non - zero then the corresponding @xmath16-group in the cluster tube is non - zero ( with equivalence in the case where the arcs are equal ) .",
    "thus , in the case of the cluster tube , we obtain a strengthening of this last result .    in section",
    "@xmath15 we recall tube categories and indicate how the ar - quiver of the tube can be constructed geometrically using admissible arcs in the annulus . in section @xmath17 we compute intersection numbers between admissible arcs in the annulus by lifting them to the universal covering space , and prove the main result . in section",
    "@xmath18 we give an interpretation of our model using doubled arcs which , in particular , gives a connection with a model for the rigid part of the cluster tube given in  @xcite . in section 5",
    "we consider the case of the category of finite dimensional representations of the linear orientation of @xmath1 .    since completing this work ,",
    "we learnt of interesting independent work in the diploma thesis  @xcite which , in particular , gives a bijection between string modules over a quiver of type @xmath19 ( i.e.  a quiver whose underlying graph is a cycle , but is not an oriented cycle itself ) and certain oriented arcs in the annulus ( regarded as a cylinder ) .",
    "a geometric interpretation of the ar - quiver is given and it is shown that the negative intersection number of two arcs coincides with the dimension of the extension group of the corresponding modules . since tubes can be obtained as subcategories of the module categories of such quivers , this gives an alternative proof of theorem  [ t : mainresult ] .",
    "the difference here is that we work directly with the tube , via finite dimensional nilpotent representations of a cyclic quiver , allowing a simpler proof for this subcategory .",
    "we also include a topological description of the relationship between intersection numbers in the annulus and its universal cover ( see section  [ s : intersectionnumbers ] ) .",
    "our approach links up interpretations of intersection numbers with and without orientation , thus strengthening results of  @xcite in this case , and also gives an explanation for the doubled arc model for exceptional objects in the tube appearing in  @xcite .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for background on the theory of finite dimensional algebras and their representations . a stable translation quiver @xmath20 without multiple arrows is said to be of _ tube type _ if it is of the form @xmath21 for some @xmath22 , cf .  @xcite .",
    "in that case we say that the tube @xmath20 has rank @xmath4 and we call the additive hull of the mesh category of @xmath20 a _ tube of rank @xmath4 _ , denoting it @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath23 is a cyclically oriented quiver with @xmath4 vertices then the category of finite - dimensional nilpotent representations of @xmath24 is equivalent to @xmath3 ( this follows from  @xcite ) ; see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* iii.1.1 ) ) .",
    "the category @xmath3 is hom - finite , abelian , hereditary and uniserial  @xcite .",
    "we have the duality @xmath25 in @xmath3 , where @xmath26 denotes the ar - translate .",
    "we can form its cluster category as in  @xcite , obtaining the _ cluster tube _",
    "@xmath10 of rank @xmath4 as the orbit category @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "as noted above , keller s theorem  @xcite applies , so the cluster tube is triangulated .",
    "this category has also been studied in  @xcite .",
    "its ar - quiver is the same as the ar - quiver of @xmath3 ( arguing as in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "1.3 ) ) . to abbreviate we write @xmath28 for the ar - quiver of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath29 be an annulus with @xmath4 marked points on the outer boundary .",
    "our goal is to use oriented arcs in @xmath30 as a geometric model for the tube and the cluster tube as introduced in subsection  [ ssec : tubes ] .    in  ( * ?",
    "* example 6.9 ) , the authors consider annuli of the form @xmath31 with @xmath32 . these have @xmath33 marked points on the outer boundary , @xmath34 marked points on the inner boundary and unoriented arcs between these marked points .",
    "more generally , the authors study triangulated surfaces as a geometric model for cluster algebras . in particular , the annuli @xmath31 give rise to cluster algebras associated to quivers of type @xmath35 with @xmath33 arrows in one direction and @xmath34 arrows in the other direction .",
    "thus it makes sense to use the annulus @xmath30 , with @xmath4 marked points on one boundary component only , to model @xmath3 , whose objects can be considered as ( nilpotent ) representations of a cyclic quiver with @xmath4 arrows all in the same direction .",
    "we consider smooth oriented arcs in surfaces with boundary .",
    "recall that two such arcs @xmath5 , @xmath6 which start at the same point and finish at the same point are said to be _ homotopy equivalent _ if there is a homotopy between them fixing the starting point and the finishing point .",
    "we write @xmath36 to denote this .",
    "let us now consider oriented arcs between marked points of the boundary of @xmath30 .",
    "we start by labelling the marked points of @xmath30 with @xmath37 , in an anti - clockwise direction .",
    "we will always take arcs up to homotopy fixing the starting and ending points . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the marked points are equally spaced around the outer boundary of @xmath30 .",
    "an oriented arc from a marked point @xmath38 to a marked point @xmath39 , for @xmath40 , is homotopically equivalent to the boundary arc which starts at @xmath38 , goes around the boundary @xmath2 times ( for some @xmath41 ) and then ends in @xmath39 ; we shall denote this arc by @xmath42 .",
    "it will be most convenient to describe oriented arcs and their intersections using the universal cover of @xmath30 . to be precise , observe that we may identify the annulus @xmath30 with a ( bounded ) cylinder @xmath43 of height @xmath0 with @xmath4 marked points on the lower boundary : we regard the cylinder as a rectangle in @xmath44 with the vertical sides identified , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : ann - cyl ] . as in the annulus , we label the marked points on the lower boundary of @xmath43 from left to right and assume that arcs are oriented anti - clockwise ( when viewed from the top of the cylinder ) , i.e. left to right in the rectangle in @xmath44 .    in a second step ,",
    "we move from the cylinder @xmath43 to its universal covering space @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , an infinite strip in the plane .",
    "we adopt the orientation on @xmath47 inherited from its embedding in the plane .",
    "the covering map @xmath48 is induced from wrapping @xmath47 around @xmath43 , i.e.  the effect of @xmath49 on @xmath50 is to take the first coordinate modulo @xmath4 : @xmath51 so @xmath52 is mapped to @xmath53 for any @xmath54 .",
    "we choose an orientation on @xmath43 such that @xmath49 is orientation - preserving . via the identification of @xmath43 with @xmath30",
    ", this induces an orientation on @xmath30 .",
    "we will also write @xmath49 to indicate the covering map from @xmath47 to @xmath30 directly .",
    "we take the integers @xmath55 , @xmath56 , as marked points on the lower boundary of @xmath47 .",
    "we define @xmath57 to be the translation which adds @xmath4 to the @xmath58-coordinate of a point in @xmath47 , with inverse @xmath59 subtracting @xmath4 from the @xmath58-coordinate of a point , so that @xmath60 for all @xmath61 and for all @xmath56 .",
