    "photometric observations combined with radial velocity measurements of stars harboring transiting giant planets yield the absolute radii , masses and densities of the planets . the ongoing photometric surveys for transiting planets have now delivered large numbers of candidates , but those observations alone can not distinguish between companions that are jupiter - size planets , brown dwarfs , or late type m dwarfs , since they all have similar radii ( of order 0.1 @xmath3 ) .",
    "they also can not distinguish between true transiting planets and so - called  blends \"  chance alignments or physical triple systems involving an eclipsing binary that can mimic planetary transits @xcite .",
    "these can be very common , particularly in crowded fields .",
    "hence follow - up spectroscopic observations are not only necessary to measure the radial velocities and derive the mass of a transiting planet , but they are also vital for weeding out astrophysical false positives .",
    "the first confirmed case of a transiting planet proposed by a photometric survey @xcite was that of ogle - tr-56b @xcite .",
    "three other examples have also come out of the ogle survey @xcite : ogle - tr-113b @xcite , ogle - tr-132b @xcite and ogle - tr-111b @xcite .",
    "additionally , the first transiting planet from a wide - field bright - star survey has recently been reported ( tres-1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this brings the total number to six , including the case of hd  209458b , a planet originally discovered in the course of a radial velocity survey and only later found to undergo transits @xcite .",
    "ogle - tr-10 was identified as a promising candidate by the ogle team during their 2001 campaign in three fields towards the galactic center @xcite .",
    "the possible planetary nature of its companion based on spectroscopic follow - up was first established by @xcite . in that paper",
    "we reported a tentative radial velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath4 , and a mass for the putative planet of @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "however , the possibility of a blend could not be categorically ruled out at the time due to the small number of observations .",
    "recently @xcite also called ogle - tr-10 a possible planet , with @xmath7  and @xmath8 @xmath6 , although these authors were still unable to completely exclude a blend scenario because of the insufficient signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of their observations .",
    "in this paper we present the results from additional spectroscopic monitoring of ogle - tr-10 with keck  i / hires on two additional runs , for a total of three seasons ( 20022004 ) .",
    "we are now able to confirm the planetary nature of ogle - tr-10b .",
    "our new radial velocities and the parameters of the parent star are presented in section  [ sec : observations ] and section  [ sec : spectrum ] .",
    "the ogle light curve solution and planet parameters are derived in section  [ sec : orbit ] , where we combine our radial velocities with those reported by @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : falsepositive ] we analyze and rule out a blend as an alternative explanation .",
    "the results are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "ogle - tr-10 was observed spectroscopically with the keck  i telescope using the hires instrument @xcite in july 2002 , august 2003 , and july 2004 .",
    "the exposure times ranged from 30 to 50 minutes and the wavelength coverage was 3850  to 6200  ( 36 echelle orders ) , at a resolving power of @xmath9 .",
    "we collected 10 spectra of which 9 were taken with the iodine gas absorption cell ( i@xmath10 ) that superimposes a dense forest of absorption lines directly on the stellar spectrum in the region from approximately 5000  to 6200  ( some 12 echelle orders ) .",
    "the iodine orders had typical snr of 15 to 25 per pixel .",
    "one spectrum was taken without the i@xmath10 to serve as the template for the iodine velocity reductions .",
    "for faint stars such as ogle - tr-10 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) light losses due to the iodine cell typically prevent one from using that technique to determine precise radial velocities in the manner done for brighter doppler targets .",
    "however , as described by @xcite precision as good as 50  can still be achieved with the i@xmath10 cell on faint targets by using a synthetic spectrum instead of an observed spectrum as the template . additionally , in order to monitor changes in the instrumental profile ( psf ) that affect the velocities significantly , we obtained observations a bright star with the i@xmath10 cell on every night we observed ogle - tr-10 .",
    "those observations were used to model the psf and establish the parameters that we then applied to ogle - tr-10 . in this way we were able to determine radial velocities with typical uncertainties of about 60  , which are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "our spectroscopic orbital solution is described below in  [ sec : orbit ] .",
    "the stellar parameters for ogle - tr-10 were derived from our high - resolution co - added keck spectrum ( snr of 44 ) with fits to synthetic spectra computed from model atmospheres for different compositions based on the atlas  9 and atlas  12 programs by @xcite .",
    "we use a code re - written in fortran-90 ( j.lester , priv .",
    "comm . ) and incorporating new routines for improved treatment of contributions from various broadening mechanisms , as well as updated and expanded opacities and line lists .",
    "this code has been tested extensively and performs very well for solar - type stars ( f - k type ) such as ogle - tr-10 .",
    "the fits between observed and synthetic spectra were made in spectral regions unaffected by the i@xmath10 lines , and including a large number of metal absorption lines of different ionization and excitation states as well as the core and wings of the @xmath134861 h@xmath14 line .",
    "our effective temperature determination , @xmath15  k , has an estimated accuracy of about 100  k ( see below ) . our projected rotational velocity , @xmath16  , is good to better than 2  ; we use an approach to the line broadening similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "our procedures allow us to derive the metallicity , [ fe / h ] , and the limb darkening parameter , @xmath17 , with good confidence .",
    "[ fe / h ] is estimated to be solar with a 0.2  dex uncertainty .",
    "the surface gravity is much more difficult to determine reliably .",
    "we estimate @xmath18 , in which the upper limit is much better constrained than the lower bound , as is common in this type of analysis . given the morphology of evolutionary tracks for main sequence stars and the lack of an independent distance estimate for ogle - tr-10 , this uncertainty in @xmath19 allows us to rule out a giant or subgiant status for the star , but provides only a weak constraint on the stellar radius on the main sequence .",
    "the stellar mass and radius were determined using a stellar evolution code described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as evolutionary tracks are nearly vertical in the @xmath20 vs.@xmath19 plane for the range of interest for ogle - tr-10 , the largest uncertainty in deriving the radius would be an error in @xmath20 .",
    "a temperature that is too hot would lead to an overestimate of the stellar mass and also a stellar radius that is too large ( given the stricter upper bound on @xmath19 ) .",
    "this in turn would lead to a significant overestimate of the derived planet radius ( @xmath21 ) in the solution of the transit light curve .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] illustrates our efforts to obtain an accurate value of @xmath20 , and in particular the strong sensitivity of balmer line profiles to the temperature .",
    "we point out that lte radiative equilibrium codes like atlas are particularly well suited to fit the wings of such lines .",
    "the cores are usually affected by chromospheres and non - lte effects , and are expected to appear deeper in a solar - type star like ogle - tr-10 .",
    "a fit to the wings of the @xmath134861 h@xmath14 line requires a careful setting of the contunuum ( for better illustration only a fraction of the hires order is shown in fig .",
    "reffig : spectrum ) . to guard against problems with contunuum setting and line broadening , in deriving @xmath20",
    "we also rely on temperature - sensitive line pairs : moderate - strength metal lines having different ( often opposite ) sensitivity to temperature and co - located ( within 0.1@xmath220.2  nm ) in wavelength ( see gray & johanson 1991 for the general idea and some line pairs ) .",
    "we get @xmath23  k , in good agreement with the balmer line wings and neutral - to - ionized metal lines comparisons .",
    "thus , based on the overall fit of the good - quality keck spectrum , ogle - tr-10 is confidently identified as a close analog to our sun .",
    "our estimates of the stellar parameters are significantly different from those reported by @xcite ( @xmath24 k , @xmath25 , [ fe / h ] = @xmath26 , @xmath27 m@xmath28 , @xmath29 r@xmath28 ) . however , as can be also seen in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] , our determinations lead to a much better match to the overall high snr spectrum of ogle - tr-10 from keck  i / hires .",
    "our radial velocities from  [ sec : observations ] show clear variations as a function of photometric phase . adopting the orbital period and epoch",
    "as reported for ogle - tr-10 by @xcite we fitted for a circular orbit solving for the center - of - mass velocity and the semi - amplitude @xmath30 ( see figure  [ fig : rv]a ) .",
    "the best - fit value of @xmath31  is consistent with the early result from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rms of our spectroscopic solution is 45  , and from monte carlo simulations we find that the probability of obtaining by chance a @xmath30 amplitude as large as we measure is only @xmath32 .    for our final spectroscopic orbital solution we combined our hires measurements with 14 velocity measurements by @xcite .",
    "the latter were obtained with two different configurations of the vlt spectrograph uves : in the standard slit mode ( hereafter uves ) , and a setup with a fiber link ( flames ) .",
    "we considered these as independent data sets , and solved for the corresponding velocity offsets relative to hires along with the rest of the orbital elements .",
    "the combined fit gives an improved velocity semi - amplitude of @xmath33 , with an rms residual of 60 ( see figure  [ fig : rv]b ) .",
    "the corresponding false alarm probability from monte carlo simulations is @xmath34 .",
    "we use this combined fit in the rest of our paper .",
    "the best - fit parameters are presented in table  [ tab : results ] , along with our light curve solution based on the ogle photometry , using the formalism of @xcite ( figure  [ fig : lcurve ] ) . by combining this information with the stellar parameters",
    "described previously we derive for the planet in orbit around ogle - tr-10 an absolute mass of @xmath0  m@xmath35 and a radius of @xmath36  r@xmath1 .",
    "the formal errors include the contribution from uncertainties in the mass and radius of the parent star .",
    "to test for the possibility that the radial velocities we measured for ogle - tr-10 are due simply to blending with an eclipsing binary , we computed the spectral line bisectors from our keck observations as described by @xcite .",
    "there is no significant variation of the bisector spans as a function of phase ( see below ) , as would be expected if lines from another star were causing asymmetries in the profiles of the main star by moving back and forth with the photometric period .",
    "similar results were reported by @xcite .",
    "next we modeled the ogle light curve in detail using the procedures described @xcite , assuming a configuration consisting of an eclipsing binary blended with the main g star forming a hierarchical triple system .",
    "although we were able to achieve an excellent fit that is essentially indistinguishable from a true transit light curve , this blend model predicts an optical brightness for the primary of the eclipsing binary that is _ greater _ than the g star itself , which is clearly not observed .",
    "we then relaxed the condition that the three stars be at the same distance , and considered models with the eclipsing binary in the background in order to make it fainter . here",
    "too we were able to find a perfectly acceptable fit for an eclipsing binary composed of an f9v star and a k5v star located several kpc behind the g star ( see figure  [ fig : figblend]a ) .",
    "the relative brightness of the eclipsing pair in this model is only about 4.5% compared to the g star , which would be just below our threshold of 5% for detecting lines of another star in the spectra ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the predicted orbital velocity semi - amplitude of the f9 star is 65  , and its spectral lines should show a rotational broadening corresponding to @xmath37  ( assuming the spin is synchronized with the orbital motion ) .    in order to test this blend scenario",
    "further we ran extensive numerical simulations following @xcite to predict the bisector span and radial velocity variations that would be expected from this configuration . in figure",
    "[ fig : figblend ] we compare these predictions with the observations as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the expected bisector span variations in figure  [ fig : figblend]b are relatively small ( less than about @xmath38  ) , and are therefore still consistent with the measurements , which show no significant variation given typical errors that are also about @xmath38  .",
    "thus , the fact that bisector spans for a transit candidate show no appreciable change with phase _ does not _ necessarily rule out a blend scenario .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : figblend]c indicates that the expected radial velocity variations are even smaller , and do not show the trend with phase displayed by the velocity measurements for ogle - tr-10 . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : orbit ] the latter velocity trend is confirmed and reinforced by independent measurements from two different data sets , as reported by @xcite . the false alarm probability based on monte carlo simulations that a set of velocity measurements resulting from such a blend scenario would have the phase coherence we observe , with a semi - amplitude as large as we observe , is @xmath39 from our hires measurements alone , and @xmath40 using all the rv data .",
    "this effectively rules out this blend configuration .",
    "experiments show that it is not possible to make the predictions more consistent with all of the observational constraints by changing the parameters of the blend model .",
    "additional evidence against a blend has been obtained recently by @xcite based on new high - quality and high - cadence photometric observations of the star .",
    "their accurate light curves in two passbands define the morphology of ingress and egress significantly better than the ogle measurements , and are clearly inconsistent with the light curve from a blend configuration such as we described above , involving a background eclipsing binary .",
    "we conclude that the observations do not support a blend scenario , and the planetary nature of the companion to ogle - tr-10 is confirmed .",
    "ogle - tr-10b is the seventh known extrasolar transiting planet and the fifth to come out of the ogle survey .",
    "admittedly the faintness of the transiting planet candidates from the ogle survey requires some of the largest available telescopes merely to confirm their planetary status , and other detailed follow - up studies are very difficult to pursue with current instrumentation .",
    "nevertheless , these discoveries around faint stars have been extremely important in the field of extrasolar planets .",
    "they account for most of the points in the current mass - radius diagram for giant planets ( see figure  [ fig : massrad ] ) , which relates key properties of these objects for our theoretical understanding of their structure and evolution .",
    "additionally , they have led to the discovery of a new class of  very hot jupiters \" @xcite with remarkably short orbital periods ( 12 days ) .",
    "the importance of faint transit candidates from surveys like ogle is likely to continue in the near future , especially given that the ogle team has recently released a new set of 40 candidates that seem very promising @xcite .",
    "the wide - field surveys , on the other hand , have only recently produced their first transiting planet @xcite despite having been in operation for longer than the ogle effort .",
    "they would provide planets for more detailed follow - up studies in the future .",
    "ogle - tr-10b is very similar to hd  209458b @xcite in terms of its orbital and physical parameters . in particular",
    ", its orbital period ( 3.1 days ) places it in the  hot jupiter \" category ( planets with periods of 34 days ) already well populated from the radial velocity surveys .",
    "ogle - tr-10b has a low average density and like hd  209458b might require an additional heating mechanism to explain it .",
    "there are now as many hot jupiters as there are very hot jupiters among the transiting planets uncovered photometrically , and so the apparent lack of longer - period planets in the transit surveys that initially appeared to cause some concern @xcite no longer seems to be a problem , as anticipated by @xcite .",
    "we note , finally , an apparent dichotomy in the mass - radius diagram of figure  [ fig : massrad ] in that the 4 planets with the longer periods ( in the hot jupiter class ) all have small masses ( @xmath410.7  m@xmath35 ) , while all the short - period planets ( very hot jupiters ) have masses roughly twice as large .",
    "this trend , noted previously by @xcite , now seems to be reinforced , and may perhaps be related to issues of survival of planets in very close proximity to their parent stars .",
