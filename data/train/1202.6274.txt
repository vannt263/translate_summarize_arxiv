    "during cell differentiation , the cell evolves from undifferentiated phenotypes in a multipotent stem or progenitor state to differentiated phenotypes in a mature cell . in this process ,",
    "the gene regulatory network , which governs the progressive changes of gene expression patterns of the cell , forces the cell to adopt the cell type - specific phenotypes .",
    "cells can have states with the higher probability of appearance , which leads to different cell phenotypes .",
    "different cell phenotypes correspond to different basins of attractions on the potential landscape @xcite .",
    "therefore the differentiation and developmental process of the cell can be thought as the evolution of the underlying landscape topography from one basin to to another .",
    "one grand challenge is to explain how this occurs , what is the underlying mechanism and how to quantify the differentiation and developmental process .",
    "furthermore , the unidirectional developmental process posses another challenge to explain the origin of time arrow .    in the cell ,",
    "intrinsic fluctuations are unavoidable due to the limited number of protein molecules .",
    "there have been increasing numbers of studies on how the gene regulatory networks can be stable and functional under such highly fluctuating environments @xcite .",
    "in addition , the gene state fluctuations from the regulatory proteins binding / unbinding to the promoters can be significant for gene expression dynamics .",
    "conventionally , it was often assumed that the binding / unbinding is significantly faster than the synthesis and degradation ( adiabatic limit ) @xcite .",
    "this assumption may hold in some prokaryotic cells in certain conditions , in general there is no guarantee it is true .",
    "in fact , one expects in eukaryotic cells and some prokaryotic cells , binding / unbinding can be comparable or even slower than the corresponding synthesis and degradation ( non - adiabatic limit ) .",
    "this can lead to nontrivial stable states and coherent oscillations appearing as a result of new time scales introduced due to the non - adiabaticity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the challenge for us is to understand how the biological differentiation and reprogramming can be functional under both intrinsic fluctuations and non - adiabatic fluctuations .",
    "previous studies showed that the change in the self activation regulatory strengths can cause the differentiation of phenotypes @xcite . in this article",
    ", we used a canonical gene regulatory circuit module to study cell fate decision and commitment in multipotent stem or progenitor cells @xcite .",
    "we will study a model of cell developmental circuit ( fig . [ circuit ] )",
    "@xcite which is composed of a pair of mutually inhibiting but self activating genes . this gene regulatory motif has been found in various tissues where a pluri / multipotent stem cell has to undergo a binary cell fate decision @xcite .",
    "for example , in the multipotent common myeloic progenitor cell ( cmp ) facing the binary cell fate decision between the myeloid and the erythroid fate , the fate determining transcription factors ( tf ) , pu.1 , and gata1 , which promote the myeloid or the erythroid fates , respectively , form such a gene network circuit . the relative expression levels a ( pu.1 ) and b ( gata1 ) of these two reciprocal tfs can bias the decision toward either lineage @xcite .",
    "we found that the change in the time scale of the binding / unbinding of regulatory proteins to the promoters may provide an new important mechanism for the cell differentiation .",
    "we studied the underlying potential landscapes associated with the differentiation and developmental process and found that the underlying landscapes developed from un - differentiated multipotent state to the differentiated states as the binding / unbinding rate decreased to the slow non - adiabatic binding region .",
    "in addition , in the slow non - adiabatic binding region , we predicted the emergence of multiple meta - stable states in the development of multipotent stem cells and explained the origin of this observation in the experiments @xcite .",
    "we also calculated the mean first passage transition time for the differentiation and reprogramming .",
    "we found that the mean first passage transition time strongly depends on the time scale of the promoter binding / unbinding processes .",
    "there is an optimal speed for differentiation and development with certain promoter binding / unbinding rates",
    ". it will be natural to ask whether the differentiation and development happens at this optimal speed ?",
    "future experimental and bioinformatics studies might be able to give the answer .",
    "we quantified the kinetic pathways for the differentiation and reprogramming .",
    "we found that they are irreversible .",
    "this captures the non - equilibrium prosperities for the biological processes of the underlying gene regulatory networks in multipotent stem or progenitor cells .",
    "it may provide the origin of time arrow for development .",
    "as shown in fig . [ circuit ] , the gene regulatory circuit that governs binary cell fate decision module consists of mutual regulation of two opposing fate determining master tf a and b. the module has been shown to control developmental cell fate decision and commitment in several instances of multipotent stem or progenitor cells that faces a binary fate decision , ( i.e. , gata1 and pu.1 ) @xcite .",
    "a and b are coexpressed in the multipotent undecided cell and committed to either one of the two alternative lineages is associated with either one factor dominating over the others , leads to expression patterns in a mutually exclusive manner @xcite .",
    "importantly , in many cases the genes a and b also self - activate ( positive autoregulate ) themselves ( fig .",
    "[ circuit ] ) . here , the hybrid promoter @xmath0 can be bound by the regulatory protein @xmath1 with the binding rate @xmath2 and dissociation rate @xmath3 ( both @xmath2 and @xmath4 can depend on protein concentration @xmath5 ) .",
    "the synthesis of protein @xmath0 is controlled by the gene state of promoter @xmath0 .",
    "there are two types of genes , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , to be translated into proteins @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "the proteins @xmath6(@xmath7 ) can bind to the promoter of the gene @xmath6(@xmath7 ) to activate the synthesis rate of @xmath6(@xmath7 ) , which makes a self - activation feedback loop .",

    "both protein @xmath6 and protein @xmath7 bind on promoters as a dimer with the binding rate @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "therefore , each gene has 4 states with self activator binding or non - binding and with mutual repression from another gene binding or non - binding ( assuming we have two different binding sites , one for self activator and one for the other gene ) .",

    "the self activation regulation coming from an effective regulation and its change is due to the regulations on these transcription factors mediated by other regulators such as klf4 . when the self activation is strong ( large @xmath42 ) , the system is mono - stable with one un - differentiated central basin , as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( or [ fig4_1 ] ) . as",
    "self activation strength @xmath42 decreases , the central basin gets weaker and differentiated basins on both sides start to develop , which results tri - stability as in fig .",

    ", @xmath21 and @xmath22 can not be both large in adiabatic limit , because they suppress each other .",
    "then , the un - differentiated central basin disappeared and two differentiated basins on both sides survives , which gives bi - stability as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( or [ fig1_1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , decreasing the self activation regulatory strength @xmath42 will lead the cell system to differentiate .",
    "changing of the effective self activation regulatory strengths of transcription factors binding to the genes therefore provides a possible differentiation mechanism which is currently under study @xcite .",
    "we would like to point out that there is another possible mechanism of the cell differentiation from the slow binding / unbinding of protein regulators to gene promoters .",
    "we noticed that for a fixed activation strength @xmath42 , cells can develop more stable differentiated states on both sides .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( or [ fig4_1 ] ) , [ fig5 ] ( or [ fig5_1 ] ) , [ fig6 ] ( or [ fig6_1 ] ) and fig .",

    "we also noticed that in the non - adiabatic slow binding limit ( small binding / unbinding rate @xmath48 ) , multiple meta - stable basins show up .",

    "[ fig6 ] ( or [ fig6_1 ] ) , [ fig9 ] ( or [ fig9_1 ] ) , [ fig3 ] ( or [ fig3_1 ] ) .",
    "these behaviors are directly due to the non - adiabatic effect : slow binding / unbinding of protein regulators to promoters . when the binding / unbinding rate @xmath48 is small , the interactions ( either repressions or activations ) between gene states are weak and different gene states statistically co - exist in cells",
    ". each gene state will give a basin in the concentration and sum of these basins will lead a multiple stable potential landscape .",
    "this results to the development and differentiation with slow binding from the original undifferentiated equally populated single basin of attraction with fast binding .",
    "slow binding provides another possible mechanism for differentiation and development .      to quantitatively characterize the dynamics of the differentiation and the reverse process as reprogramming , we study the speed of differentiation and reprogramming in terms of mean first passage time ( mfpt ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] . in an attractor landscape , the lifetime of an attractor reflects its stability , which can be measured by mfpt .",
    "mfpt is the average transition time induced by intrinsic statistical fluctuations of molecule numbers between attractors on a landscape , since the traversing time represents how easy to switch from one place to another .",
    "when the binding / unbinding rate @xmath48 is relatively large , the un - differentiated central basin becomes more stable , as in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( or [ fig4_1 ] ) , [ fig7 ] ( or [ fig7_1 ] ) , [ fig1 ] ( or [ fig1_1 ] ) , and cells have more chances to stay in the un - differentiated state .",
    "therefore , the differentiation process will be more difficult and mfpt is longer for faster binding . for the differentiation process",
    ", it is noticed that , as the binding / unbinding rate @xmath48 increases , the mfpt decreases first , and then increases . in the non - adiabatic limit ( small binding / unbinding rate @xmath48 ) , the differentiation limiting step is the binding / unbinding events .",
    "therefore , increasing binding / unbinding speed @xmath48 will accelerate the kinetics from the un - differentiated central basin to differentiated side basins .",
    "so for the differentiation process , caused from faster binding to slower binding of regulatory proteins to the genes , we notice that the speed for differentiation is slow when state is dominated by undifferentiated state for faster binding , and is also slower for slower binding which is due to the occasional binding being the rate limiting step for differentiation .",
    "there is an optimal speed for differentiation .",
    "as binding becomes faster from low speed end ( non - adiabatic limit ) , the speed of differentiation is controlled by the binding speed and therefore increases .",
    "as the binding becomes even faster , the differentiation is dominated by the escape from the undifferentiated basin of attraction and therefore is significantly slowed down .",
    "this creates an optimal speed for differentiation and development .",

    "[ fig11 ] ) and @xmath52 ( [ fig12 ] ) , the mfpt for the reprogramming decrease as the increasing of thbinding / unbinding speed @xmath48 , because the stability of un - differentiated symmetric central state increases with the binding / unbinding speed @xmath48 as we can see in potential landscapes , fig .",

    "[ fig13 ] , since there is no self - activation and no stable symmetric central basin in the landscape , the reprogramming is difficult and the mfpt is very long for different the binding / unbinding speed @xmath48 .",
    "both the differentiation and reprogramming can be caused by the change of gene regulations during the developmental process .",
    "here we consider the evolution of the binding / unbinding rate from fast to slow @xmath53 from @xmath54 for the differentiation and the evolution of the binding / unbinding rate @xmath55 + 0.001 $ ] from @xmath56 for the reprogramming from slow to fast .",
    "the transition paths from gillespie simulation are plotted in fig .",

    "it is interesting to observe that the biological dynamic paths are irreversible , i.e. the differentiation path and reprogramming path are totally different . in the differentiation process ,",
    "the system stay on the multipotent undifferentiated state for a while until binding becomes slower .",
    "as the binding becomes slower , the undifferentiated state becomes less stable .",
    "furthermore , the gene state can be switched through binding / unbinding event of regulatory proteins to the promoters and the system will then be evolved from the undifferentiated basin to the differentiated basin of attraction . in the reprogramming process",

    "our theory gives a possible explanation for the origins of those meta - stable states in the experiments .",
    "we show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the potential landscape and the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the intrinsic fluctuations of protein concentrations and gene state fluctuations through promoter binding .",
