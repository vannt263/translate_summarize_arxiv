    "evolution of a degenerate c  o stellar core with a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit ( @xmath14 for a carbon white dwarf , see bisnovatyi - kogan , 1989 ) leads to the development of thermal instability and to the explosion .",
    "the critical density @xmath15 for the beginning of the explosion may vary from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "it increases with reduction of @xmath18  the core mass growth - rate which for a single asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star is defined by the paczyski  uus relation ( paczyski , 1970 )    @xmath19    and can take values from @xmath20 to @xmath21 in an accreting white dwarf ( iben , 1982 ; hachisu et al . , 1996 ) . in the present paper",
    "we assume @xmath22 which can be appropriate both for a single agb - star and for a component of a binary system .",
    "the explosion calculations , some of which accounted for convection , were carried by various authors ( arnett , 1969 ; ivanova et al . , 1974 ; nomoto et al . , 1976",
    "; see also the review by niemeyer and woosley ( 1997 ) ) .",
    "ivanova et al.(1974 ) found that carbon was burning in the deflagration regime with excitation of pulsations , but convection at the supernova stage was not considered , and the initial temperature profile was obtained not from evolutionary calculations , but from an estimate of a convection contribution .",
    "woosley ( 1997 ) has carried out a series of one - dimensional explosion calculations for accreting white dwarfs ( unfortunately , in this work the accretion rates are not specified ) with critical central densities from @xmath23 to @xmath24 and with nuclear reactions for 442 isotopes , but he considered only the adiabatic convection at the presupernova stage , while at the beginning of the thermal runaway ( when @xmath25 k ) he turned off the convection artificially ( because further maintenance of the adiabatic temperature gradient in his model led to the prompt detonation ) , and defined the burning front propagation velocity according to woosley and timmes ( 1992 ) with a provision for a fractal dimension of the front .",
    "many authors ( e.g. iben , 1982 ) use the hydrostatic system of equations with adiabatic convection in the stellar core , when calculating the presupernova evolution ( with time - scale @xmath26 yr ) which is valid for this stage , but is too crude at the beginning of the thermal runaway .",
    "we carried our calculations both on the presupernova stage and on the stage of explosive burning by the hydrodynamic scheme elaborated in papers by blinnikov and rudzsky ( 1984 ) , blinnikov and bartunov ( 1993 ) , and by blinnikov and dunina - barkovskaya ( 1993 , 1994 ) . in the latter two papers",
    "this hydrodynamic scheme was used for the calculation of white dwarf evolution .",
    "here we have included non - adiabatic time - dependent convection in well - known mixing length approximation : @xmath27                         /(\\partial e/\\partial t)_\\rho\\ , , \\label{tdot}\\\\ \\partial x_{\\rm c}/\\partial t & = & - x_{\\rm c}^2 r_{\\rm cc } + ( \\partial x_{\\rm c}/\\partial t)_{\\rm conv}\\ ; , \\label{xcdot}\\\\ \\partial u_{\\rm c}/\\partial t & = & 2(v_{\\rm c}^2-u_{\\rm c}^2)/l_{\\rm mix}\\ ; , \\label{ucdot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the mass fraction of @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the energy release during the carbon burning , @xmath31 stands for standard neutrino energy losses ( as approximated by schinder et al . , 1987 ; see also haft et al . , 1994 ) , @xmath32 is the energy liberation during the gravitational contraction , @xmath33 is the radiative energy flux , @xmath34 is the convective energy flux , @xmath35 is the time - dependent convective velocity ( see arnett 1969 ) , and @xmath36 is the stationary convective velocity in the mixing length approximation which is given by the formula ( see , e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan , 1989 ) @xmath37    the convective energy flux @xmath34 and the value @xmath38 , which corresponds to the change of a carbon mass fraction @xmath28 by convection , were calculated by the formulas @xmath39    @xmath40    the arrangement and the sizes of the convective zones are defined by the schwarzschild criterion ( according to the aforecited formulas ( [ vconv ] ) and ( [ fconv ] ) ) . on the presupernova stage",
    "we did not account for time - dependent convection and",
    "the formulas ( [ fconv][dxcconv ] ) contained @xmath36 instead of @xmath41 .",
    "a comparison of calculations with stationary and time - dependent convection on the supernova stage was performed in ( dunina - barkovskaya , imshennik , 2000 ) .",
    "the mixing length in the @xmath42-th mass zone was determined by the relation @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the size of the convective zone containing @xmath42-th zone , and @xmath45 in our calculations was taken equal to unity .",
    "thermodynamic functions for the electron - positron gas ( the pressure @xmath46 , the entropy @xmath47 etc . ) were calculated with help of nadyozhin s asymptotic realtions described by blinnikov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and for the ionic gas with screening  by yakovlev and shalybkov ( 1988 ) .",
    "the initial state of the presupernova c  o core should to be taken from reliable evolutionary calculations .",
    "we begin our computations with the central density @xmath48 which , according to iben ( 1982 ) , corresponds to the central temperature about @xmath49  k. everywhere below we define , as a beginning of the runaway and , thereafter , as an end of the presupernova stage , the moment of time when the temperature in the central zone reaches the value of @xmath50 .",
    "the initial carbon mass fraction @xmath51 ( constant throughout the c  o core ) was taken the same as in iben s ( 1982 ) work . assuming the above - mentioned central parameters for the c  o core and its total mass @xmath0 , we have computed the adiabatic configuration in hydrostatic equilibrium which was used as an initial condition .",
    "it should be mentioned that its difference from iben s ( 1982 ) model seems insignificant .    during the calculations of the evolution of this model with account for a constant mass growth - rate @xmath21 ( typical for accreting white dwarfs in binary systems ) ,",
    "it is worth - while to set a non - zero outer boundary condition for the pressure . in our previous work ( dunina - barkovskaya , imshennik , 2000 ) , where the calculations led to relatively small changes of the total mass before the runaway",
    ", we included all the accreting mass in the outer boundary condition .",
    "this condition is easily derived in the approximation of a thin ( @xmath52 ) and light ( @xmath53 ) envelope .",
    "really , by integrating the hydrostatic equilibrium equation @xmath54 over the envelope thickness we obtain for the pressure @xmath55 on the outer boundary of the zone with the lagrangean coordinate @xmath56 : @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 during the hydrostatic evolution , i.e. the outer pressure @xmath55 from ( [ pex ] ) increases in proportion to the time @xmath60 which is measured from the beginning of the c  o core evolution calculations .    in this case",
    "the full mass @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is the mass of @xmath63 lagrangean zones contained in the hydrodynamic model ) grew up to @xmath64 , in accordance with evolution time @xmath65 yr ( dunina - barkovskaya , imshennik , 2000 ) .    in the present work",
    ", we have gradually , according to the accretion , added new lagrangean zones to the model ( cf .",
    "woosley , 1997 ) .",
    "the mass of the zones decreased geometrically from @xmath66 ( 151-th zone ) down to @xmath67 ( the last , 170-th zone ) .",
    "it was found in this case that the equation ( [ pex ] ) is quite inaccurate ( evidently because @xmath68 is not very small ) . as a result ,",
    "the evolution time on the presupernova stage increased nearly twice .",
    "for the variants with non - zero @xmath8 the mass of the model reached @xmath69 after @xmath70 yr , and the number of the lagrangean zones became @xmath71 .",
    "after that we have added no lagrangean zones , but simulated accretion by increasing the outer pressure . in the runaway point",
    "( after @xmath72 yr since the beginning of calculations ) the outer pressure corresponded to the additional external mass from @xmath73 ( for @xmath74 ) to @xmath75 ( for @xmath76 ) . in the control variant with @xmath77 the temperature in the central zone increased to @xmath50 already after @xmath78 years , therefore the model mass could grow only up to @xmath79 , which corresponds to the number of zones @xmath80 .",
    "let us consider the boundary condition ( [ pex ] ) during the explosion for the variant with @xmath81 when @xmath82 , and @xmath83 cm ( fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath84 where @xmath85din @xmath86 . this value is to be compared with the central pressure of the c  o core which has the well - known lower estimate @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the ratio of the outer boundary pressure to the central one , @xmath88",
    "@xmath89 @xmath90 , is surely very small at the beginning of the runaway . in the subsequent runaway process it certainly changes and can increase by factor of a few , but nevertheless remains small enough which can be seen from the numerical results .",
    "it is easy to estimate that the relative contribution of the inertial term into the derived boundary condition ( [ pb133 m ] ) with characteristic parameters of c  o core pulsations @xmath91 will be small : no more than a few percent .",
    "thus we can neglect it in ( [ pex ] ) even when the pulsations amplitude is maximal @xmath92 and @xmath93 by the end of deflagration burning ( see fig .",
    "this boundary condition imposed by the mass accretion onto the c  o core surface is in close agreement with the outer boundary condition assumed in the previous works ( ivanova et al . , 1974 ;",
    "ivanova et al . , 1977a ) with the same dependence on an outer radius @xmath94 :",
    "@xmath95 ( [ pb133 m ] ) .",
    "let us remind that in the cited works the outer pressure also simulated the presence of the outer c  o core envelope .",
    "it was taken small enough , but about a factor of 2 higher than the value from ( [ pb133 m ] ) .",
    "thus , the effect of the outer boundary was more pronounced there than in the present work , but less significant than in ( dunina - barkovskaya , imshennik , 2000 ) .",
    "it should be stressed that the non - zero outer pressure @xmath96 violates the energy conservation law during the explosion ( see fig .  4 , 5 ) when the pulsations arise and the radius @xmath94 of the c  o core changes .",
    "naturally , accounting for the accreting matter in the outer boundary condition ( [ pex ] ) and ( [ pb133 m ] ) we imply its attachment to the evolving c  o core without any further energy release , i.e. merely an adhesion .",
    "in fact , this substance has , generally speaking , another chemical composition , and can go through the thermonuclear reactions with an energy liberation and even with partial ejection of the accreted material .",
    "we simply neglect those processes . on the other hand ,",
    "the role of the outer boundary condition ( [ pb133 m ] ) is very significant during the explosion , especially when the detonation wave forms near the surface ( see below ) .",
    "in the present work we have systematically investigated the models numerically with different values of the mixing length parameter ( [ lmixdri ] ) equal to @xmath97 ; @xmath98 ; @xmath99 ; @xmath100 ; @xmath101 . from a physical standpoint , it is very difficult to choose a certain value @xmath8 from this wide range in the used approximate theory of non - adiabatic convection .",
    "the energy release in the thermonuclear reaction of carbon burning @xmath5c@xmath6c @xmath102mg@xmath103 was taken , first , by a rather crude formula obtained by fowler and hoyle ( 1965 ) with electron screening factor by salpeter ( 1954 ) ( see also salpeter and van horn 1969 , and arnett 1969 ) , and , second , with a maximum possible energy liberation corresponding to the instantaneous combustion of all the carbon - oxygen mixture to @xmath7ni . the energy release accepted here was taken from our early work ( ivanova et al .",
    "it is convenient for the further comparison of our previous results with those obtained in the current work .",
    "such a simplification of a thermonuclear energy generation can not affect essentially the obtained results due to the comparatively small sensitivity of the ignition conditions for the c  o mixture to all pre - exponential values in the expression for the thermonuclear burning rate .    as a result of the presupernova evolution calculations we obtained that just prior to the runaway the density drops to a value which depends non - monotonically on the parameter @xmath8 and",
    "is maximal when @xmath97 .",
    "in general , the initial critical central density ( in units @xmath48 ) @xmath104 turned out to be close to the one accepted earlier by ivanova et al .",
    "( 1974 ) and later by ivanova et al .",
    "( 1977a ) ( @xmath105 ) , though it is somewhat lower .",
    "let us remind that in 1970s the most popular viewpoint was that single intermediate mass stars evolve along the convergent pazcyski s ( 1970 ) track after the formation of the carbon ( or carbon - oxygen ) core .",
    "the modern approach to the presupernova evolution involves the evolution in a close binary system with an accreting white dwarf . in this case , according to yungelson ( 1998 ) , all the stars in the initial main sequence mass range @xmath106 may become carbon - oxygen white dwarfs in close binary systems .",
    "this range does not differ significantly from the similar range for single stars @xmath107 considered previously ( pazcyski , 1970 ) .    , the central density @xmath108 , the convective core mass @xmath109 , and the radius @xmath110 of the @xmath63-th ( last ) lagrangean zone upon time for @xmath111 after the convective core formation .",

    "the phase of the slow expansion before the runaway ( see above ) is almost unnoticeable on this graph because its duration ( @xmath115 yr ) is small in comparison to the overall evolution time ( during which the star , as a whole , was contracting very slowly ) and practically does not depend on @xmath8 .    ) for various values of the parameter @xmath8 . ]    in fig .  2 ,",
    "the initial profiles of temperature depending on the mass coordinate are represented at the moment of the beginning of explosion ( see above ) .",
    "it can be seen that the temperature in the convective variants is appreciably higher than that in the variant without convection .",
    "even for @xmath116 the temperature exceeds this value almost by a factor of 2 in the central part of the convective core .",
    "let us notice that in this moment there is an active combustion only in the first mass zone . on fig .",
    "2 we compare the initial temperature profiles with data from ivanova et al .",
    "( 1977b ) . in the latter work the explosion developed for the two ( upper ) @xmath117-profiles .",

    "the adiabatic temperature profiles are also shown , with the entropy equal to the entropy of the 2nd mass zone for each variant .",
    "it can be seen that our profiles lie quite below the corresponding adiabatic profiles , and they have another shape for @xmath120 , which of course can affect the development of the runaway without the regime of spontaneous burning ( blinnikov , khokhlov , 1986 ) .     and of the full energy of the c  o core @xmath121 for @xmath97 and @xmath10 ( prompt detonation ) .",

    "the basic result of our numerical calculations is that the pulsational deflagration regime eventuates when the mixing length is small enough , namely @xmath126 .",
    "it was found that for @xmath132 the prompt detonation occurs ( see fig .",
    "hereby we obtained a reasonably accurate threshold for the transition from the detonation to the pulsational deflagration .    on fig .",

    "the time dependence of the central temperature and of the total energy is shown for the computation with @xmath137 . here",
    "the total number of pulsations is appreciably larger than on the previous graph , but only 14 of them were accompanied by the propagation of deflagration into a neighboring mass zone , which can be well seen by very narrow specific maxima of the temperature @xmath138 .",
    "let us notice that these narrow maxima correspond ( due to the energy generation ) to the small jumps of the value @xmath121 . in the variant with @xmath13 one to three mass zones were burning during each pulsation ( except for 5th and 7th ) ,",
    "so almost all the pulsations had the said temperature peaks ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the deflagration regime is distinctly characterized by the profiles of density which are represented versus the eulerian radius @xmath139 in fig .  6 for @xmath13 .",
    "the density drops by a factor of @xmath140 at the deflagration front .",
    "depending upon the pulsation phase the front either moves inward ( the contraction phase ) or outward ( the expansion phase ) during the overall propagation ( by mass zones ) .",
    "the pulsations can be seen more clearly by the behaviour of the outer layers of the star , in the still unburnt matter .",
    "the amplitude of the outer radius pulsations grows in time and attains the value of @xmath141 ( this can be seen well due to the logarithmic scale for density in fig .  6 ) .",

    "it can be seen that at the burning front the density of matter distinctly increases displaying the detonation burning regime .",
    "the supersonic character of detonation is also revealed by the quiescence of stellar layers outside the burning front .",
    "the convective processes are most neatly characterized by the profiles of the specific entropy which are shown in fig .  8 for the case @xmath13 versus the mass coordinate @xmath145 ( in logarithmic scale ) .",
    "the convective zones which are defined by the known schwarzschild criterion , i.e. correspond to the regions with the negative entropy gradient , are marked on these profiles for some typical moments of time .",
    "this figure shows that the primary convective core during the runaway is being separated into some convective zones , the largest of which includes one of two mass zones behind the burning front and the rest of the convective core before the front .",
    "the separation process is of nonstationary character and indicates the importance of the time - dependent convection .",
    "the entropy profiles are given in fig .",
    "8 before the formation of the detonation wave propagating towards the center ( see fig .  4 ) . after the formation inception of such a wave , naturally , in a very short time @xmath146 s , the entropy behind the detonation front rises to the values which are typical also for the deflagration , @xmath147 , i.e. by factor of 4 - 6 more than an initial entropy ( @xmath148 , with a positive gradient . only in outer layers",
    "( with @xmath149 ) the negative entropy gradient persists , and , therefore , the convection occurs , partly preventing the detonation process described here .",
    "the important role of the convection intensity characterized by a parameter @xmath8 attracts our special attention .",
    "it is clear that the deflagration burning regime with pulsations ( of course , the deflagration is not necessarily accompanied by pulsations , but for the latter the subsonic deflagration is the necessary condition ) takes place in the whole range of the @xmath8 values , @xmath150 .",
    "it is essential that @xmath151 is above zero , because for @xmath77 in our calculation there was no hydrodynamic explosion at all , although the first mass zone was burning .",
    "we note that for higher critical densities @xmath152 which is the case for lower accretion rate ( see above ) , the value of @xmath151 can drop practically down to zero ( zmitrenko et al . , 1978 ) .",
    "however , for high densities @xmath15 the account for neutrino energy losses together with the neutronization kinetics is required ( ivanova et al .",
    ", 1977a , c ) . but in the present case ( @xmath153 ) the role of these complicated processes is not important , which was shown by direct comparison of the calculations of ivanova et al .",
    "( 1974 ) with those of ivanova et al .",
    "( 1977b ) at the close value of central density @xmath154 .",

    "this coordinate is virtually independent of the parameter @xmath8 . in our model in the 150th zone the mass grid changed from uniform to geometrically decreasing . in the work ( dunina - barkovskaya , imshennik , 2000 ) the 127th mass zone in which the detonation begins had the same feature",
    ", so we have to investigate the influence of a mass grid nonuniformity on a detonation initiation in our future work . in the present section",
    "we shall try to give a physical justification of the entropy growth that leads to the detonation .",
    "after some first pulsations , i.e. long before the generation of the burning front , the entropy of the outer mass zones begins to increase ( fig .  9 ) .",
    "at the moment @xmath157  s ( the beginning of the last pulsation ) two local entropy maximums exist , the outermost one ( @xmath158 ) and the innermost one ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "though the entropy in the innermost maximum is less than in the outermost one , the temperature in the innermost maximum during the last pulsation is higher ( due to the higher density ) . just at this maximum",
    "the detonation burning front is born ( see fig .",
    "we can see the relatively high growth of entropy between the close moments @xmath160  s and @xmath161  s , between the maximum and the minimum of the second ( ! ) pulsation ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , which is less by amplitude than the subsequent pulsations .",
    "it can be seen on the graphs for density ( fig .",
    "10 ) that the moments close to the maxima of pulsations are accompanied by a subsequent emergence of the compression waves on the stellar surface . following ivanova et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , one can estimate the entropy growth @xmath162 treating these compression waves as weak shocks with a pressure jump @xmath163 .",
    "the one gets the well - known entropy jump ( landau and lifshitz , 1954 ) : @xmath164 this estimate is easy to apply in the case under consideration because we can account only for the pressure of the completely degenerate ultrarelativistic electron gas @xmath165 , with @xmath166@xmath167g@xmath168s@xmath169 , in calculation of the second adiabatic derivative in ( [ ds ] ) , whence it follows that @xmath170 such an approximation is possible because in the zone under consideration with @xmath171 we can take as an estimate for the values @xmath172 and @xmath173 in front of the involved weak shock their values at the moment @xmath160  s , namely , @xmath174 , and @xmath175k . after a simple rearrangement we get the final expression for the specific entropy growth in ( [ ds ] ) ( @xmath47 is in units @xmath176 , see fig .",

    ". then we finally get from ( [ ds8 ] ) : @xmath179 , whereas in fig .",
    "9 the entropy growth between these two moments is @xmath180 .",
    "thereby we can reasonably explain the entropy growth obtained in calculations as a result of a weak shock dissipation which occurs in the region of a rather abrupt density decrease .",
    "closer to the surface the entropy growth subsides , according to ( [ ds8 ] ) , because of the density lowering towards the star edge , and inward it subsides too , probably due to the wave amplitude reduction ( see also fig .  10 ) . nevertheless , the local entropy maximum ( fig .",

    "11 , we represent the temperature profiles from the moment of the burning front initiation ( @xmath183 ) to its `` collision '' with the deflagration front at a radius @xmath184 cm ( which corresponds to the mass from the center @xmath185 ) at the moment @xmath186  s. on this graph the beginning of the expansion of matter behind the detonation wave can be well seen : the outer radius rises from @xmath187 cm to @xmath188 cm at the temperature @xmath189 .",
    "when the detonation wave propagates in the direction of increasing density , the temperature rises to @xmath190 , partly due to the heat capacity decline .",
    "the compression on the front is typically modest : only by a factor of 1.5 ( see fig .",
    "the pressure jump is not high too : about a factor of 2 till the end .",
    "it is remarkable that the generation of the detonation front really occurs at the innermost entropy maximum ( see fig .",
    "9 ) , which corresponds in fig .",
    "11 to the innermost temperature maximum at the moment @xmath157  s.    a fair question arises : whether such a detonation front is stable with respect to galloping instability considered recently by imshennik et al .",
    "this question requires an additional analysis , but it is conceivable that the stability here is more natural , because the density in front of the detonation wave increases which counteracts the decoupling of the shock wave front from the burning zone .",
    "there is one more argument in favor of the stability against the multidimensional disturbances , namely , the large enough width of the burning zone which can be compared with the c  o core radius at the densities @xmath191 ( imshennik , khokhlov , 1984 ) .",
    "this implies also that the burning of the c  o mixture as a matter of fact does not fuse the elements to `` iron '' ( `` fe '' ) in the converging detonation wave , but is limited , for example , by such nuclides as si etc .",
    "the problems of nucleosynthesis in the obtained regime of delayed detonation should be investigated in other works .",
    "in the current study , first of all , we obtained the initial conditions , justified by evolution calculations , for the thermonuclear runaway in the carbon - oxygen stellar core with a mass close to the chandrasekhar limit due to the accretion prescribed by a constant value @xmath192 , which does not contradict to the current evolutionary studies of close binary systems . in our simulations",
    "the runaway begins at the moment defined by the calculation itself ( and the equations do not change , except for the account for the time - dependent convection ) .",
    "thus , we do not have to solve a complicated problem of the choice of the initial conditions , which largely affected the inception of the runaway . in our previous work ( ivanova et al .",
    ", 1974 , 1977a , b , c ) the initial conditions ( i.  e. the initial temperature profiles ) were defined , strictly speaking , without an adequate justification .",
    "the present computations include a well - known approximate model of a nonadiabatic convection , namely , the mixing length theory with the only arbitrary parameter @xmath8 ( a ratio of the mixing length @xmath193 to the radial extent of the convective zone @xmath44 ) .",
    "the value of this parameter could be , in principle , extracted from the multidimensional approaches developed currently ( see lisewski et al . , 2000 ) , i.  e. the arbitrariness of the approximate theory could be removed . as a result of our computations",
    "it was found that the delayed detonation regime takes place under quite a wide range of values @xmath194 .",
    "the lower boundary of this interval is defined as an upper estimate . at higher values of a parameter @xmath195 in our calculations the ordinary detonation propagating from the center of the stellar c ",
    "o core was obtained , which is unlikely to take place because of the instability of the burning front etc .",
    "it could be interesting to find out whether the specified interval intersects with the region of effective mixing length parameters justified by a multidimensional theory of turbulence .",
    "but already with the parametric simulations of the flame propagation velocity we can impose some restrictions on the parameter @xmath8 . for example , we can notice that for @xmath196 during the burning of a few first mass zones this velocity was close to the laminar front velocity obtained by woosley and timmes ( 1992 ) .    in the present work , due to an application of the new hydrodynamic code with a variable lagrangean ( difference ) grid and with account for an outer boundary pressure conditioned by accretion , we have obtained a scenario of the development of a delayed detonation propagating from the surface towards the center of the star .",
    "the detonation is , in all probability , stable with respect to the galloping instability , and is conditioned by a preceding stage of the pulsational deflagration .",
    "this may prove to be important because of the recently emerged scepticism ( lisewski et al .",
    ", 2000 ) in regard to the scenario of the deflagration to detonation transition due to the destruction of the laminar burning front by turbulent eddies published earlier ( khokhlov et al . , 1997 ) .",
