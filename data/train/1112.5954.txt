    "there are several different methods of calculating the lepton asymmetry , that may be generated in the early universe .",
    "this variety of approaches is a feature that leptogenesis  @xcite has in common with many other topics in particle theory .",
    "the approach that is perhaps most commonly applied is to calculate the decay asymmetry of individual right handed , singlet majorana neutrinos @xmath0 from @xmath1-matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "these asymmetries , obtained by quantum field theoretical methods , are subsequently substituted into classical boltzmann equations , that describe the macroscopic non - equilibrium dynamics and the evolution of the asymmetry . by lsz - reduction",
    ", @xmath1-matrix elements can be obtained from time ordered @xmath2-point green functions .",
    "we then enjoy the usual simplifications of time - ordered perturbation theory , _",
    "i.e. _ we can calculate the @xmath2-point functions using the standard diagrammatic feynman rules .",
    "the price to pay for this simplification is cutting the direct link between the non - equilibrium dynamics and the generation of the @xmath3-asymmetry at the quantum level .",
    "a particular problem turns out to be due to the instability of the singlet neutrinos , which causes that the @xmath1-matrix , that involves the @xmath3-asymmetric decays and inverse decays of these singlets , is not unitary , or rather , that it does not correspond to an @xmath1-matrix in the proper sense . as a consequence ,",
    "the unitary evolution of the non - equilibrium system must be carefully re - implemented , which is performed in practise through the non - trivial method of real intermediate state subtraction  @xcite . without real intermediate state subtraction",
    ", one would predict from substituting the rates from the @xmath1-matrix elements into the network of boltzmann equations the presence of a lepton asymmetry even in thermal equilibrium , which would be an unacceptable violation of the @xmath4 theorem .",
    "for resonant leptogenesis  @xcite , it is assumed that the mass difference @xmath5 of two of the singlet neutrinos is small compared to their average mass @xmath6 , or , more precisely , the energy difference is small compared to the average energy .",
    "decays and inverse decays , that induce off - diagonal correlations of the singlet neutrinos in their mass eigenbasis , then lead to a relatively large mixing , which enhances @xmath3-violation . in the @xmath1-matrix approach , the mixing appears as a wave function correction to the singlet neutrino propagator in the decay diagrams  @xcite .",
    "the mixing that is calculated in this way is time - independent , which excludes the possibility of incorporating the effect of oscillations .",
    "alternatively , one can avoid the subtleties concerning unitarity by computing the real - time evolution of the quantum state from the outset .",
    "this can either be achieved by using the canonical hamiltonian approach or functional , closed - time - path ( ctp )  @xcite methods .",
    "this may appear as a complicated task , but one should keep in mind that the @xmath3-asymmetry arises in the @xmath1-matrix language at the one - loop level . in a real time approach , it turns out that in a diagrammatic representation , we have to go to two - loop level .",
    "however , the leading @xmath3-violating effects can be extracted by imposing some of the internal particles to be on - shell , which may be considered as a generalisation of the cutkosky rules  @xcite . in the end ,",
    "the integrals that are relevant for the leading order prediction of the @xmath3 asymmetry are identical to those encountered in the @xmath1-matrix approach , but with the advantage that an overcounting of particular processes in the boltzmann equations , that would violate unitarity , is avoided by construction .",
    "the canonical approach makes use of the property of the hamiltonian as the time evolution operator .",
    "a blueprint of this canonical approach , is the theory of neutrino oscillations in refs .",
    "it has been noticed that when supplemented by @xmath3-violation , the oscillations may lead to the creation of a lepton asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of describing mixing oscillations is one key advantage of the canonical approach when compared to using @xmath1-matrix elements . on the other hand , without a set of diagrammatic rules , the perturbation expansion is rather cumbersome .",
    "this is why the remaining important @xmath3-violating contribution , that is sometimes referred to as direct @xmath3-violation ( _ e.g. _ in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , has not been calculated in the hamiltonian approach . in the @xmath1-matrix approach",
    ", this contribution arises from the penguin - shaped vertex diagram . besides , the decays of the singlet neutrinos into standard model leptons are described in practise by appealing again to the @xmath1-matrix formalism .",
    "therefore , one may state that within the hamiltonian approach , no entirely closed picture for the emergence of the lepton asymmetry has yet been developed .    in principle",
    ", it should be possible to derive a set of diagrammatic rules that simplifies the calculations within the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "however , such a set of rules is readily available .",
    "it arises in an elegant and rather intuitive manner from the functional formulation of the ctp formalism  @xcite . in the ctp approach ,",
    "the hamiltonian time evolution of the density matrix is replaced by schwinger - dyson equations for the two - point green functions .",
    "these equations have four matrix components from the two indices that denote the two branches of the ctp .",
    "the kadanoff - baym equations are those of the schwinger - dyson equations , that encompass the macroscopic evolution of the system .",
    "recently , this approach has proved successful in order to describe leptogenesis within a single theoretical framework  @xcite .",
    "both , @xmath3-violation from wave - function and vertex corrections are incorporated .",
    "unitarity issues are resolved and an accurate account of all quantum - statistical effects on the asymmetry is made . moreover",
    ", the formulation in terms of green functions bears the potential of incorporating corrections from thermal field theory within this formalism . for the @xmath3-conserving production rate of singlet neutrinos , several phenomenologically relevant thermal corrections",
    "have recently been calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite . when it comes to the rate of @xmath3-violation , an aspect that is not dealt with in refs .",
    "@xcite is the possibility of flavour oscillations between the singlet neutrinos .",
    "the present work addresses this shortcoming .    while in ref .",
    "@xcite , the wave function correction is calculated using the perturbative loop expansion , the present work captures the same effect by solving the kadanoff - baym equations for the singlet neutrino propagator directly . in the limit where the mass difference is much larger than the decay rate @xmath7 of the singlets , @xmath8 , the standard perturbative result is reproduced . when @xmath9 or smaller , it becomes important that the solution to the kadanoff - baym equations corresponds to a resummation of all wave - function insertions .",
    "this is a generalisation of the familiar procedure for time - independent situations , which can be performed by the summation of a geometric series .",
    "the result obtained in the present work from the kadanoff - baym equations encompasses both , time - independent and oscillating contributions to the mixing of the singlet neutrinos .",
    "we note that for a model of the asymmetric decay of a scalar field , it was clarified in refs .",
    "@xcite that the hamiltonian approach incorporates indeed the wave - function contribution to the @xmath3-asymmetry from decays in the vacuum as it is usually calculated from @xmath1-matrix elements .",
    "the present work goes beyond this proof of principle not only because it also treats the decays of majorana fermions , but also because it formulates the evolution of the asymmetry in an interacting , finite - density system within the single framework of the ctp formalism .",
    "our results may therefore be employed for phenomenological studies of resonant leptogenesis in the early universe .    in order to further describe the context of this present work",
    ", we note that for computations of the asymmetry from @xmath1-matrix elements , it has been realised that the resonant enhancement factor @xmath10 should be regulated by the finite width of the singlet neutrinos  @xcite . for solutions to the kadanoff - baym equations in wigner space , . ]",
    "it turns out that the non - equilibrium distribution functions are not multiplied by a finite - width , breit - wigner distribution , but rather by a zero width , dirac @xmath11-function .",
    "the observation of this somewhat curious property has lead to the speculation that these zero - width solutions arise due to an incorrect treatment of pinch singularities that must be addressed by a non - perturbative resummation  @xcite , that is yet to be specified .",
    "this may be perceived as an obstacle for the formulation of an effective theory of resonant leptogenesis within the ctp framework .",
    "however , it was recently demonstrated analytically and numerically , that the vanishing width is a correct property of the out - of - equilibrium wigner functions . within loop diagrams ,",
    "the zero width is corrected for by a resummation of derivative operators , which effectively shifts the argument of the @xmath11-function from the real axis into the imaginary direction of the complex plane  @xcite .",
    "in the kadanoff - baym equations , this effect may be of relevance when the tree - level scattering processes are kinematically forbidden .",
    "as this is not the situation that we assume for the present purposes , the corrections that are explained in ref .",
    "@xcite are subdominant in the final result for the asymmetry and therefore are neglected here .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite imply however , that a straightforward solution of the kadanoff - baym equations should indeed regulate the asymmetry when @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , this is what we explicitly find in the present work .",
    "after these comments , we present the outline of this paper : in section  [ section : scalar ] , we use the schwinger - dyson equations on the ctp , in particular the kadanoff - baym equations , in order to calculate the asymmetry that emerges from the decays of mixing neutral scalar particles .",
    "the kadanoff - baym equations decompose into constraint and kinetic equations .",
    "when @xmath13 , one may use either of these equations in order to derive the asymmetry . if this is not the case , one should use an expansion based on @xmath14 . in this limit",
    ", the kinetic equations take the form that is familiar from the time - evolution of a density matrix in the hamiltonian approach . in order to gain a qualitative understanding ,",
    "we derive analytical solutions for the mixing propagator in the case of two mixing flavours in a constant - temperature background .    in section  [ section :",
    "fermions ] , we apply the same approximation strategies as for scalars to mixing majorana neutrinos . as an additional complication , we need to solve for the various spinor components of the singlet neutrino propagator . however , it turns out that the flavour dynamics shares the same essential features with the scalar model . even though our main interest is the decay of majorana fermions , a reader who is less interested in these technical details can skip this section and continue with section  [ section : illustrative ]",
    "there , we discuss some features of the analytical solutions for the asymmetry in a model in constant temperature background , for both , fermions and scalars .",
    "in particular , we see that when @xmath13 , the effect of oscillations of the singlet neutrinos averages out and the standard results for the decay asymmetry from @xmath1-matrix elements apply .",
    "however , when the condition @xmath13 does not apply , the oscillations can have a significant effect on the asymmetry .    in section",
    "[ section : effective : theory ] , we present the modifications of the kinetic equations that arise in an expanding universe .",
    "we therefore eventually arrive at an effective theory for resonant leptogenesis , that is formulated within the ctp framework . in section",
    "[ section : conclusions ] , there are a short summary of this paper as well as concluding remarks .",
    "the perhaps simplest model for generating a charge asymmetry from out - of - equilibrium decays is given by  @xcite @xmath15 the field @xmath16 is a complex scalar that can be associated with a charge , while the @xmath17 are real singlet scalar fields , that can create a charge asymmetry within @xmath16 when decaying out - of equilibrium .",
    "we sum over repeated indices @xmath18 .",
    "we take here @xmath19 , for simplicity .",

    "in both cases , the result for @xmath80 can then be substituted into the source term  ( [ asymmetry : compact ] ) .",

    "@xcite , must not give sizable corrections to the phenomenological results .",
    "in the resonant regime , such corrections are suppressed by the small oscillation frequency and therefore effectively by factors of order @xmath78 , while in the non - resonant regime , the suppression results from the averaging of the oscillatory contribution to the source for the asymmetry , as we discuss below .",
