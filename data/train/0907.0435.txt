    "the radiation from luminous quasi stellar objects ( qsos ) can currently be studied up to redshift 6.5 and thus allows one to probe , over much of the universe s age , the properties of their central black holes ( bhs , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their broad line region ( blr , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the ionization state of intergalactic gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the most distant qsos are of importance for both the study of galaxy evolution and large  scale structure . among the most surprising discoveries in this field",
    "are the detection of bh masses",
    "@xmath9 m@xmath4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the apparent constancy of the observed qso blr properties with redshift , even up to @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , corresponding to an age of 870myr .",

    "* hereafter k07 ) and / @xcite emission line ratios observed in the blr of @xmath11 qsos are as high as that observed in low - redshift objects .",
    "thus , near - solar metallicity in the centers of some of the earliest systems and accretion of @xmath9 solar masses in a central bh can be attained in less than 1gyr .",
    "one caveat , however , has to be taken into account : until now only the most luminous objects at @xmath8 have been studied .",
    "these objects may experience faster evolution than less luminous objects and therefore resemble low to intermediate redshift qsos already at @xmath2 .",
    "secondly , the relationships established using low - luminosity agn ( at low redshift ) may not be valid for objects at the upper end of the luminosity distribution .",
    "as an example , the determination of the bh mass in active galaxies was calibrated with reverberation mapping observations of agn that are one to two orders of magnitude fainter than the @xmath2 qsos observed until now @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to extend @xmath12 studies to lower  luminosity objects . here",
    "we present the first observations of a qso at @xmath13 with luminosity lower than l@xmath14 ergs@xmath15 : the qso ( hereafter j0303 - 0019 ) .",
    "this qso was detected in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) deep stripe with a magnitude of @xmath16 .",
    "its discovery spectrum shows a very strong and narrow ly@xmath17  emission line at @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "as this line falls in the @xmath19-band , the actual continuum luminosity is low , @xmath20 , 1.5 magnitudes fainter than the mean of the @xmath8 qso samples studied in k07 and @xcite .",
    "in addition , this is one of the two out of about twenty @xmath2 qsos that are not detected at 24@xmath6 m with mips / spitzer , implying a rest frame 3.5@xmath6m/4400ratio far lower than for any other known qso ( * ? ? ? * l.  jiang et al . in prep . ) .",
    "nir spectroscopy of j0303 - 0019 in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands was obtained in service mode on december 24 and november 26 and 28 , 2007 , respectively , with isaac @xcite at vlt ut1 .",
    "we used the short wavelength arm , equipped with a 1024@xmath231024 hawaii rockwell array which has a pixel scale of 0.147 .",
    "the 1  slit results in a spectral resolution of 550 and 450 for the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bands , respectively .",
    "observations were carried out in a standard abba offset pattern , with additional dithering to reduce the influence of bad pixels .",
    "individual exposures were 148s , repeated 16 times per observing block .",
    "nine such blocks were obtained in @xmath22 band , for a total exposure time of @xmath245.9hr , and two in @xmath21 band , for a total time of @xmath241.3hr .",
    "the data were reduced using eso s isaac pipeline software , which does flat fielding , background subtraction , rectification and combination of the individual frames in one observing block .",
    "we used sky lines to determine the wavelength calibration , obtaining an absolute 1@xmath25 error of 3 and 7 , respectively , in @xmath21 and @xmath22 band .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were extracted from the pipeline products in iraf .",
    "b and g stars with known nir photometry were used to correct for telluric absorption and initial flux calibration of the one - dimensional spectra .",
    "finally , the one - dimensional spectra were averaged to obtain the final spectra .",
    "these were flux calibrated using the broad band magnitudes obtained with the calar alto 3.5 m telescope ( see sec.[ssec : nir_img ] ) .",
    "the reduction is similar to that carried out by k07 , where more details are reported .      for accurate flux calibration ,",
    "the qso sdss j0303 - 0019 was imaged with the prime - focus nir camera omega2000 @xcite at the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto , spain .",
    "this instrument has a 2k@xmath232k hawaii-2 detector with a pixel scale of 0.45 , resulting in a field of view of 15.4@xmath2315.4 .",
    "j0303 - 0019 was observed on september 10 and 11 , 2008 , for 20 , 20 , 25 , and 77 minutes in @xmath26 , and @xmath27 bands , respectively .",
    "after dark subtraction and flat fielding with twilight exposures , the images were sky subtracted , registered and averaged with xdimsum in iraf .",
    "the seeing full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) on the combined images is 1.3 , 1.4 , 1.3 , and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "the combined images were astrometrized using the public service provided by astrometry.net @xcite using a second order polynomial to correct for distortions ( which are small for omega2000 ) .",
    "subsequently , we used about 80 stars from the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources @xcite to obtain the magnitude zero points . for @xmath21band , we used the ukidss second data release @xcite catalog .",
    "only half of the observed field is covered by ukidss , but this still provides 31 stars usable for the flux calibration .",

    "the obtained nir photometry of j0303 - 0019 ( table  [ tbl : nir_mags ] ) is consistent with a power law sed with slope @xmath34 , as measured in lower redshift qsos @xcite .",
    "imperfect flux calibration of the nir spectra , however , may affect the slope of the reduced @xmath21 and @xmath22 band spectra .",
    "indeed , the slope observed in the @xmath22 band seems redder and may be fit better by a slope of @xmath35 or even @xmath36 . as the nir spectra are too short and the data not of sufficient quality to constrain the slope , we carry out emission line fits employing a range of slopes @xmath37 fixed to = 0 , -1.0 , and -1.5 , to cover the complete range of plausible slopes .",
    "we take the slope of @xmath35 as the best compromise and use the parameters derived from fits employing the two extreme values to construct conservative error estimates on the fitted parameters .",
    "the  and  lines are fit by single gaussian functions on top of the co - addition of the power - law continuum , a balmer pseudo - continuum and a template of  lines ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of the latter two components were scaled with the power - law continuum , according to their proportions in the composite qso spectrum by @xcite .",
    "as the strength of the emission is not well constrained by the current spectra , but clearly lower than four times the strength in the sdss composite spectrum , we have also carried out the fitting assuming a four times stronger and four times weaker  contribution to establish proper error estimates .",

    "as in k07 and @xcite , we use the relations for and presented by @xcite and @xcite , respectively , which are also those applied to a sample of more than 60,000 sdss qsos by s08 . due to the scatter of individual data points around this relation m@xmath40  can be determined only within a factor of three . for j0303 - 0019",
    ", we derive m@xmath40  with these methods and take into account the range of power - law slopes and  template strength described in sec .",
    "[ ssec : spectra ] .",
    "we obtain m@xmath40  of 1.6@xmath41 and 2.5@xmath4210@xmath43 m@xmath4 , respectively , from the and lines .",
    "these are the lowest m@xmath40  derived in a @xmath13 qso to date , showing that , with this sample of fainter @xmath8 qsos , we are indeed probing down the mass function of bhs .",
    "we note that the central wavelength of the  line is blue shifted by 350 kms@xmath15 w.r.t .  the  line .",
    "according to s08 , this modest shift ( @xmath44 kms@xmath15 ) implies that the  line profile is dominated by gravitational effects and that m@xmath40  can therefore be reliably estimated from this line .",
    "the m@xmath40  derived from the line widths and corresponding eddington luminosities of @xmath45 = 46.31@xmath46 , and 46.51@xmath47 ergs@xmath15 , respectively , are small compared to the qso s bolometric luminosity of @xmath48@xmath280.04 ergss@xmath15 , implying a high eddingtion ratio ( r@xmath49 ) . from optical , ir , and radio data ( l.  jiang et al , in prep . ) , the bolometric luminosity of j0303 - 0019 is determined as in @xcite to be @xmath50 ergss@xmath15 .",
    "it is close to the values of @xmath51 = 46.62 , and 46.65 ergs@xmath15 obtained using the monochromatic luminosities at 1350  and 3000 , respectively , and the bolometric correction factors employed by s08 ( bc@xmath52 = 3.81 , bc@xmath53 = 5.15 ) . reconciling these values",
    ", we obtain the estimated bolometric luminosity stated above .",
    "the eddington ratio of most qsos is between 0.01 and 1 and only 804 out of the 62,185 sdss with m@xmath40  determined from their line  width have r@xmath49@xmath54 ( s08 ) . the eddington ratios for j0303 - 0019 derived from the  and  lines are r@xmath49  = 1.9@xmath55 and 1.2@xmath56 ( see table  [ tbl : line_meas ] and fig .  [",

    "less than 2% and 0.2% of the sdss qsos have such an r@xmath49()@xmath571.9 and r@xmath49()@xmath571.2 .",
    "even if we assume that the other four ( faint ) @xmath2 qsos of the complete sample of qsos discovered in the sdss deep stripe @xcite have r@xmath49  @xmath581.2 , the fraction of l@xmath59 ergs@xmath15 qsos at @xmath2 with r@xmath49  @xmath571.2 is 33% , almost 40 times higher than at lower redshifts .",
    "the chemical composition of gas clouds in the blr can be explored by comparing observed emission line ratios to models .",
    "the heavy elements in the blr are products of the star formation history in the host galaxy and therefore indicators of past star formation in at least the very center of the host .",
    "@xcite present several emission line ratios observed in sdss qsos at @xmath60 and models explaining the ratios .",
    "according to @xcite , the strength of the / ratio is strongly correlated with the luminosity of the qso , which can be interpreted in terms of higher gas metallicity in more luminous qsos .",
    "although j0303 - 0019 is one of the faintest qsos at @xmath2 , it has a @xmath61 of -26.2 , which makes it moderately luminous in comparison with the sdss qsos studied by @xcite .",
    "we measure a ratio of / = 1.61@xmath280.07 , the highest ratio among the known @xmath8 qsos , and also higher than those measured in the composite spectra of quasars in the luminosity range @xmath62 by @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the blr has a high metal abundance , possibly as high as 10z@xmath4 ( see fig .  29 in",
    "* ) , but the authors warn that estimates of the blr metallicity using only emission line ratios involving might be quite uncertain ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the intense uv radiation of the qso keeps a region around the qso ionized , the strmgren sphere , which will actually only be spherical if the igm surrounding the qso is homogeneous . outside this region ,",
    "uv photons are absorbed by neutral hydrogen and this causes complete absorption blueward of the wavelength of redshifted ly@xmath17 , the so - called gp trough @xcite . for reasons discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the strmgren sphere radius is difficult to measure and we rather use the size of the proximity zone ( r@xmath63 ) , defined as the region in which the transmitted flux is @xmath5710% of the ( extrapolated ) continuum emission when smoothed to a resolution of 20  ( as shown by the grey line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) .",
    "we measure the blue edge of this region to be at 8513@xmath281  ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) . combined with the systemic redshift of @xmath64 derived from the  line ( redmost dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ) , we compute ( k07 ) the co  moving radius of the strmgren sphere to be r@xmath65 = 4.5@xmath280.3mpc .",
    "this is a typical value for luminous @xmath2 qsos ( see , e.g. , k07 , * ? ? ?",
    "the average size of qso strmgren spheres , however , decreases by a factor @xmath242.5 over @xmath66 , consistent with an increase of the neutral fraction with redshift @xcite .",
    "sdss j0303 - 0019 has the lowest bh mass known at @xmath2 and is a truly peculiar qso : it has one of the highest eddington ratios observed for a qso , it has the highest / ratio observed in @xmath2 qsos , which is also significantly higher than that observed in lower redshift composite spectra of qsos , and it is one of the two @xmath2 qsos that is not detected in deep 24@xmath6 m observations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* l.  jiang et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "the other qso which is not detected at 24@xmath6 m is ( hereafter j0005 - 0006 ) , which also has a high eddington ratio : 2.4 as derived from the based m@xmath40  and 1.0 as derived from the based m@xmath40(k07 ) .",
    "detections at 250ghz and 1.4ghz have also been attempted but neither of the objects were detected down to rms values of 0.51 , 0.48mjy and 62 , 130@xmath6jy , respectively @xcite .",
    "in contrast , these qsos were detected at 3.6 , 4.5 and 5.8@xmath6 m with irac / spitzer ( * ? ? ? * l.  jiang et al .  in prep . ) , implying a rest frame 3.5@xmath6m/4400  ratio far lower than for any object in the @xmath2 qso sample , and lower than for any of the pg qsos observed by @xcite and @xcite for which the sensitivity at 3.5mu rest - frame is not an issue .",
    "@xcite show that the optical / ir seds of the observed @xmath2 qsos can be fit by two components : a power - law representing an accretion disk and a black - body representing hot dust .",
    "the respective ( 1@xmath25 ) upper limits of 21@xmath6jy and 9@xmath6jy at 24@xmath6 m for j0303 - 0019 and j0005 - 0006 , significantly lower than the expected flux of @xmath24160@xmath6jy based on seds of other @xmath2 qsos , suggests the absence of hot dust . the implied lack of dust",
    "could be explained if the gas is metal  poor , as in a galaxy host which has not experienced major star formation yet .",
    "however , this interpretation would contradict the potentially high metallicity based on the measured / ratio . alternatively",
    ", the non - detection of the hot dust component could be due to different dust properties , or due to a surrounding cool dust torus hiding the hot component @xcite .",
