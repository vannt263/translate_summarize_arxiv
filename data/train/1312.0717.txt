    "the unusual and remarkable transport properties of graphene have attracted considerable attention , including : an unconventional quantum hall effect  @xcite ; the possibility of testing the klein paradox  @xcite ; the aharonov - bohm effect in graphene rings  @xcite , as well as mesoscopic effects , such as weak localization  @xcite , conductance fluctuations  @xcite , quantum noise  @xcite , coulomb blockade  @xcite , and anderson localization  @xcite ; specular andreev reflection and josephson effect  @xcite ; formation of a wigner crystal  @xcite ; voltage - driven quantum oscillations of the conductance  @xcite ; intriguing electron lensing  @xcite , and other fascinating phenomena ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "studies of graphene are also inspired by its potential application in nanoelectronic devices , because the electron concentration can vary considerably due to applied electric fields , and graphene can have both electrons and holes as high - mobility charge carriers .",
    "a main feature of the graphene electron structure , which is very different from conventional two - dimensional electron systems , is the existence of six dirac cones at the corners of an hexagon - shaped brillouin zone with a massless linear electron - hole dispersion .",
    "this specific spectrum for the charge carriers leads to a number of interesting transport properties , or imparts new features to them .",
    "the phenomena listed above are caused by the quantum peculiarities of graphene , and these manifest at the _ quantum _ level .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to emphasize that the quantum features of the graphene conductivity can also play a very important role in _ classical _ macroscopic phenomena .",
    "a nontrivial example of a classical phenomenon is the propagation of the electromagnetic waves localized near a graphene layer inserted into a dielectric  @xcite .",
    "it is known that surface electromagnetic waves can not propagate along the interface between two dielectrics .",
    "surprisingly , the addition of only one monatomic graphene layer changes radically the _ macroscopic _ electrodynamic properties of the system .",
    "the graphene layer can support a surface wave between two dielectrics and can play a very important role in other problems of plasmonics ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the dirac spectrum of electrons leads to new features of the electrodynamic response of the electron - hole plasma in graphene , as compared to conventional electron systems .",
    "for instance , the existence of a localized transverse - electric ( te ) mode , a mode which can not exist in systems with a parabolic electron dispersion , was predicted in ref .   for the graphene in",
    "a _ symmetrical dielectric environment_. thus , both the transverse magnetic ( tm ) and transverse electric surface waves can propagate along the graphene layer . however , these tm and te modes exist in very different frequency ranges . indeed , as shown in ref .",
    ", the frequency range for the te modes can vary from radio to infrared frequencies , depending on the carriers concentration , but the tm surface waves do not exist at the frequencies for the te modes .    in this paper",
    ", we predict the coexistence of localized both te- and tm - polarized electromagnetic waves that can propagate _ in the same frequency range _ along the graphene layer inserted into a photonic crystal ( pc ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the te - polarized localized waves can propagate along the graphene layer placed between two semi - infinite dielectrics _ with very similar _ permittivities only .",
    "here we consider the case when the graphene layer is in a _ non - symmetrical environment_. we show that , due to the periodic structure of the environment , localized te - polarized waves can exist even in such a non - symmetric case . moreover , this periodicity also allows the possibility for propagation of the te- and tm - polarized localized waves in the same frequency range , contrary to the case of propagation of the te- and tm - polarized waves along the graphene layers placed between two identical semi - infinite dielectrics .",
    "we also consider the problem of the excitation of the te- and tm - polarized modes by the external wave that irradiates the pc - graphene - pc structure .",
    "we show that the resonance peak of the transmissivity of the structure appears , when changing the frequency or the incident angle , due to the tm or te surface waves excitation , independently of the polarization of the exciting wave .",
    "the predicted phenomenon can be observed in the terahertz frequency range , which is very important for various applications but not easily accessible with modern electronic and optical devices .",
    "this technological perspective provides an additional motivation for study of these phenomena .",
    "the analysis of the resonance peaks of the wave transmissivity can give important information on the graphene conductivity in the centimeter , millimeter , and submillimeter wavelength frequency ranges .",

    "note that the edges of these forbidden zones , expressed in dimensionless coordinates @xmath69 and @xmath70 , are the same for different frequency ranges .",
