    "recently there has been much interest in understanding and quantifying the entanglement present in quantum many - body systems .",
    "the aim of this program of research is to shed new light on systems , particularly strongly correlated systems , that are difficult to treat with conventional approaches .",
    "most studies have focused on quantum spin systems , especially near quantum phase transitions , see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "the concept of entanglement is well - defined in these systems as the spins can be considered distinguishable .",
    "the subject of entanglement becomes more subtle when the system to be studied consists of many _",
    "indistinguishable _ particles .",
    "examples of such systems span many fields of physics : quantum optics experiments , ultracold atomic gases , itinerant electrons and superconductors .",
    "even the question of which states are entangled is the subject much recent debate  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty arises from the lack of individual identity of the particles that are supposed to be entangled , which is manifest as the necessary symmetrization or antisymmetrization of the quantum wavefunction .",
    "wiseman and vaccaro  @xcite have recently proposed a measure of entanglement for systems of indistinguishable particles that is operational in the sense that it quantifies the amount of `` accessible '' entanglement in the system where a local particle number superselection rule restricts the possible operations that may be performed .",
    "this is in contrast to other measures such as the mode entanglement , where the physical meaning of the entanglement measure is not so clear as the measurements required to demonstrate entanglement are not obviously possible .",
    "the rapidly - developing field of mesoscopic electronics may provide a useful testing ground for comparing different notions of entanglement in condensed matter systems as experiments to demonstrate entanglement may be feasible in the near future  @xcite .",
    "the accessible entanglement , which is referred to as the `` entanglement of particles '' in  @xcite , is defined as the amount of entanglement that could be extracted from the system and placed in conventional quantum registers , from which it could be used to perform quantum information processing tasks , such as teleportation . in many physical systems",
    "it may be difficult to extract all , or even some , of this entanglement , but the quantity itself may still give insight into the physical properties of the system .",
    "an analogy with thermodynamics is helpful . in thermodynamics",
    "it is often fruitful to consider quantities such as the amount of free energy in a system , even in the absence of an explicit scheme to extract that free energy .",
    "if the total entanglement is taken to be analogous to the total internal energy , then the accessible entanglement is somewhat analogous to the free energy .    in",
    "@xcite the entanglement of particles was defined and evaluated for a number of states of indistinguishable particles .",
    "however there is a lack of studies of entanglement of particles in explicit physical models . in this work",
    "we aim to fill this gap by investigating the entanglement of particles in a number of simple physical systems , and compare and contrast to other approaches to studying entanglement .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] by reviewing the definition of entanglement of particles and explaining its motivation in terms of superselection rules and measurements . in sec .",
    "[ sec : smallsystems ] we study ground and thermal states of systems of bosons and fermions with a small number of modes . we show that for any number of modes non - interacting bosons have zero entanglement of particles , as one might intuitively expect",
    ". however non - interacting fermions can have non - zero entanglement of particles .",
    "we then study the effect of interactions on the entanglement of particles using the bose - hubbard and fermi - hubbard models as examples .",
    "we contrast the behaviour of the entanglement of particles with the entanglement of modes and show that the two measures can display opposite behaviour as one varies the interaction parameter .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : multimode ] we turn to multimode systems . in [ sec : epcorrel ] we show how to calculate the entanglement of particles from correlation functions .",
    "a particularly striking example of entanglement of indistinguishable particles is the non - interacting electron gas as studied in  @xcite . in those works the `` two - spin reduced density matrix ''",
    " a concept common in many - body physics  is used to study entanglement .",
    "it is shown that there is a finite length over which the non - interacting electrons are entangled . in [ sec : freeelectrons ] we show a similar effect in a lattice model of non - interacting electrons , where the entanglement persists over many lattice sites . in [ sec : continuum ] we make the connection to the continuum explicit and argue that writing down a two - spin reduced density matrix on the lattice leads to difficulties in interpreting the entanglement .",
    "the subtle difficulty stems from the indeterminate number of particles at any particular location .",
    "our results show that the phenomenon of entanglement of non - interacting electrons may feasibly be observed in an experiment .",
    "in this section we review the concept of entanglement of particles , as defined by wiseman and vacarro  @xcite and explain why we consider it an appropriate measure of entanglement in condensed matter systems .    in many - body physics",
    "it is common to represent the state of a system in the _ occupation - number representation_. if @xmath0 is a complete set of single - particle wavefunctions ( for example modes localized in position or momentum ) then a many particle state is written @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a set of occupation numbers for the single particle modes ( for fermions the occupation numbers are restricted to be 0 or 1 due to the pauli exclusion principle ) , and the @xmath3 are coefficients in the superposition . formally , the space of occupation - number states is equivalent to a tensor product space where each mode is a factor ( subsystem ) , and the occupation number of each mode represents a distinct state in that subsystem .",
    "it is thus tempting to define the `` entanglement '' in a many - body state as being with respect to this mode decomposition .",
    "following  @xcite , for bipartite systems we may quantify the _ entanglement of modes _ , @xmath4 , as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is some bipartite measure of entanglement ( e.g.   entanglement of formation , entanglement of distillation , negativity ) , @xmath7 and @xmath8 each control some subset of the total modes , and @xmath9 is the total state shared by @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "this approach is advocated in , for example , @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of modes depends on which modes @xmath7 and @xmath8 control , as discussed in  @xcite , but not on the local mode decomposition that they choose .",
    "the difference between entanglement of particles , which we define shortly , and entanglement of modes stems from the local particle - number superselection rule which may apply to systems of massive particles .",
    "operationally , a superselection rule ( ssr ) is a restriction on the allowed physical operations ( closed or open evolution , preparation , measurement , etc . ) on a system  @xcite .",
    "it is sometimes asserted that certain superselection rules apply _ in principle _ due to some underlying symmetry of the system , e.g.  a ssr for charge that appears in lorentz - invariant quantum field theories .",
    "however it is possible to lift superselection rules by constructing an appropriate reference frame for the quantity in question , the most famous example of this procedure being the thought experiment of aharonov and susskind  @xcite .",
    "whether or not superselection rules apply in principle is not important for our purposes .",
    "we simply note that often a superselection rule applies in practice due to the lack of an appropriate reference frame .",
    "the example we will be concerned with is the superselection rule for _ local _ particle number .",
    "consider a bipartite state of one particle superposed over two modes , where each party controls one of the modes : @xmath10 the phase @xmath11 in this superposition is only meaningful relative to some shared reference frame .",
    "two examples of systems that could act as a reference frame for this phase are a large coherent state of light if the particle were a photon , or a bose - einstein condensate if it were a bosonic atom .",
    "however without such a reference frame , as is generally the case in condensed matter systems , the phase is not accessible to experiment and the state @xmath12 is indistinguishable from the averaged state @xmath13 which is an incoherent mixture of the particle being in one mode or the other .",
    "notice that in the above example averaging over the unknowable phase @xmath11 is equivalent to projecting onto fixed local particle number .",
    "this is a general result  if two parties , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , share a multimode state of indistinguishable particles , @xmath9 , and a local particle number superselection rule applies , then this state is indistinguishable from the averaged state @xmath14 where @xmath15 projects onto fixed particle number @xmath16 and @xmath17 at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the sum runs over all possible local particle numbers  @xcite .    for these reasons wiseman and vaccaro  @xcite argue that the entanglement of modes does not capture the true amount of entanglement that the two parties , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , share since in order to take advantage of it they would need to be able to perform arbitrary local operations on the modes . in general such local operations would violate the local particle number superselection rule and are hence not possible in practice .",
    "wiseman and vaccaro give an operational definition of bipartite entanglement of indistinguishable particles by using the concept of a _ standard quantum register _  a set of distinguishable qubits    which each party possesses .",
    "they define the _ entanglement of particles _ as the maximal amount of entanglement that the two parties can produce between their standard quantum registers by local operations on the modes that they have access to . because the standard quantum registers consist of distinguishable qubits their entanglement may be measured by any standard measure of bipartite entanglement .    in  @xcite only pure states are considered",
    ", however a definition of entanglement of particles @xmath18 that applies for mixed states as well is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the ( unnormalized ) state conditioned on obtaining the results @xmath16 and @xmath17 for a measurement of local particle number at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath21 is the probability of obtaining that result and @xmath22 is the entanglement of modes in @xmath23  , before calculating the standard bipartite measure of entanglement , @xmath6 . ] . in words ,",
    "the entanglement of particles is the weighted sum of the entanglement of modes when local particle number is measured .",
    "it is sensitive , for example , to entanglement in spin between two particles at distinct spatial locations , but not to `` occupation - number entanglement '' such as exists mathematically in the state @xmath12 above but would be impossible to extract in an experiment without a shared reference frame",
    ".    it would be most in the spirit of the operational definition to use the _ _",
    "distillable entanglement__@xcite as the entanglement measure , @xmath4 .",
    "however this measure is often difficult to calculate , so throughout this paper we use _ entanglement of formation _ instead , as it is generally easier to calculate .",
    "in general the distillable entanglement is less than the entanglement of formation , and it is possible for a quantum state to have non - zero entanglement of formation but zero distillable entanglement .    the effective measurement of local particle number that appears in the definition of entanglement of particles is formally due to a lack of phase reference , as discussed above .",
    "however in many experimental scenarios the measurement does actually occur .",
    "for example in measuring correlations in spin between electrons in a mesoscopic conductor a measurement of spin ( up or down ) simultaneously implies that an electron was also measured at the location of the detector . in measuring a mode or modes , e.g.  momentum mode / s in a mesoscopic conductor , the hamiltonian coupling the measuring apparatus to the mode will typically commute with the total occupation number for the mode / s .",
    "it is straightforward to show that under these circumstances the set of generalized measurements ( povms )  @xcite that can be implemented have kraus operators that commute with the total occupation number .",
    "this implies that the generalized measurements obey the superselection rule .",
    "an example of a measurement that does not commute with local particle number , and therefore does not obey the superselection rule , is a projective measurement in the basis @xmath24 .",
    "practically it is often convenient to use entanglement witness to prove that a certain state is entangled .",
    "we note that entanglement of particles could be detected by measuring an entanglement witness that commutes with local particle number , as discussed for optical lattices in  @xcite .",
    "in other words states which are entangled in modes but not in particles are not detected by this type of entanglement witness .",
    "we now study some simple systems using the entanglement of particles in order to build intuition for its behaviour before moving to multimode systems in the next section .    in order to share a state with non - zero entanglement of particles @xmath7 and @xmath8 must each be in control of at least two modes , and there must be at least two particles in the system .",
    "therefore the simplest possible system in which there is entanglement of particles is two particles in four modes .    in these minimal systems",
    "the entanglement of particles is due solely to entanglement of the modes at @xmath7 and @xmath8 when there is one particle at each location ( i.e.  only the @xmath25 term from eq .",
    "( [ eq : epdef ] ) contributes ) . because there are two modes at @xmath7 and @xmath8 we have an effective two qubit system for which it is possible to calculate the entanglement of formation in closed form as a function of the density matrix for pure   or mixed states  @xcite .",
    "perhaps the simplest model for interacting bosons on a lattice is the bose - hubbard model . for four lattice sites ( modes )",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 are the usual boson annihilation and creation operators that satisfy @xmath29 = \\delta_{j , j'}$ ] , @xmath30 is the number operator for site @xmath31 , and we have imposed periodic boundary conditions , @xmath32 for @xmath33 .    for a fixed total number of bosons ,",
    "@xmath34 say , we write out the hamiltonian matrix in the fock basis and calculate the eigenvalues and eigenstates .",

    "the other distinct partition , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 control diagonally opposite modes never contains entanglement in either the ground or thermal state . at @xmath36",
    "we have no entanglement of particles , as seems reasonable since the bosons are non - interacting .",
    "in fact it is possible to show that the ground state of the non - interacting bose - hubbard model with an arbitrary number of sites has zero entanglement of particles for any possible bi - partition .",
    "consider an @xmath37-mode ring containing @xmath6 non - interacting bosons .",
    "the ground state is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the vacuum state containing zero particles in each mode .",
    "if @xmath7 controls @xmath16 modes and @xmath8 @xmath17 modes ( @xmath40 ) , and we project onto @xmath7 and @xmath8 having @xmath41 and @xmath42 bosons respectively ( @xmath43 ) , then using the commutation relations amongst the boson modes @xmath44 in words , the projected wavefunction is proportional to a factorized wavefunction where @xmath7 or @xmath8 s wavefunction is the ground state of their @xmath41 or @xmath42 non - interacting bosons as if their @xmath16 or @xmath17 modes were arranged in a ring .",
    "therefore there is no entanglement of particles for any division of the lattice into @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "by contrast the entanglement of modes is non - zero between any two partitions with respect to this spatial mode decomposition , even for non - interacting bosons .",
    "for @xmath45 we have non - zero entanglement of particles in the ground state , which increases with @xmath35 and plateaus at approximately @xmath46 .",

    "it is straightforward to calculate the spectrum by fourier transforming the annihilation operators , @xmath80 . for @xmath34 particles",

    "furthermore the equal mixture of these two states , i.e.  the @xmath67 limit of the canonical - ensemble thermal state , has the same values for @xmath74 and @xmath83   for the mixed state  @xcite . using the negativity , which is an upper bound for the entanglement of distillation , @xmath84  @xcite , it is possible to show that @xmath84 is strictly less for the mixed state than for either pure state . ] .",
    "so we have the somewhat surprising result that even _",
    "non - interacting _ fermions can have non - zero entanglement of particles in the ground state .",
    "this is in stark contrast to bosons , where in the non - interacting limit the entanglement of particles was zero .",
    "mathematically the reason that non - interacting fermions can have non - zero entanglement of particles but non - interacting bosons can not is that the commutation relations needed to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : factoredfreebosons ] ) as a local particle number projection from eq .",
    "( [ eq : groundfreebosons ] ) do not hold for fermions .",
    "motivated by this counterintuitive behaviour of non - interacting fermions we now turn to another simple , and perhaps more experimentally - relevant , model of two fermions in four modes  the hubbard dimer .",
    "the two - site hubbard model ( hubbard dimer ) for fermions with spin ( e.g.  electrons ) is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a position label and @xmath87 is a spin label .",
    "the @xmath48 term describes hopping between the two sites while conserving spin , and the @xmath47 term is a coloumb interaction between fermions on the same site .",
    "the hubbard dimer is a simple model for a number of physical systems , including the electrons in a @xmath88 molecule  @xcite .",
    "by varying @xmath48 we have a model of bond breaking as the two atoms are separated .",
    "the ground state may be calculated exactly as a function of @xmath35 , see e.g.  @xcite , @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    for the purposes of calculating entanglement of particles it seems most natural to imagine party @xmath7 controlling the up and down modes of one site and party @xmath8 the up and down modes of the other site .",
    "with this partition we see that the entanglement of particles in the ground state comes entirely from the second term in  ( [ eq : g0 ] ) , where there is one fermion at each site forming a singlet .",
    "the projected state , the singlet , has entanglement of formation equal to @xmath92 , and as @xmath35 increases the probability @xmath74 increases from @xmath93 to @xmath92 as the fermions are forced to localise on each site . at a fixed temperature",
    "we see that the entanglement of particles reaches a peak as a function of @xmath35 .",
    "when interpreted as a model for @xmath88 bond - breaking the peak corresponds to an optimal distance at which the trade - off between entanglement and probability of measuring one electron at each atom is maximized .",
    "however in reality the hubbard model is only a good approximation to the molecule when @xmath35 is not too large or small  @xcite , and at finite temperature vibrational modes will become relevant , so it is unclear whether this effect could actually be observed in @xmath88 .",
    "the behaviour of the canonical - ensemble thermal state is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : hubbarddimer_thermal ] . for any @xmath35 the entanglement of formation of the projected state approaches @xmath92 ( singlet ) as the system is cooled to the ground state ( @xmath94 ) , whereas the probability , @xmath74 , approaches some value between 0 and 1 that increases with @xmath35 ( as the particles become more localized )",
    ".    in @xcite zanardi performed a similar calculation of entanglement in the ground state of the hubbard dimer .",
    "he calculates what we refer to as the entanglement of modes between the two sites , which does nt distinguish local entropy arising from indefinite local particle number ( `` charge fluctuations '' ) and that from entanglement of the spins ( `` spin fluctuations '' ) . from his point of view",
    "the ground state becomes less entangled as one increases @xmath35 as it goes from a superposition over four local states at each site ( @xmath69 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) to a superposition over just two ( @xmath95,@xmath96 ) . from the entanglement of particles viewpoint it is only the `` spin fluctuations '' that are due to accessible entanglement between the two sites , and these increase with @xmath35 .",
    "zanardi also considers the entanglement of modes in the reciprocal ( momentum ) space , where the fourier - transformed mode operators are @xmath98 , for @xmath99 , @xmath87 . in this mode representation",

    "if @xmath7 controls one @xmath102 mode and @xmath8 the other there is no entanglement of particles in this state .",
    "finally , one could imagine @xmath7 controlling both up modes and @xmath8 both down modes .",
    "to observe this type of entanglement we could , for example , use a magnetic field to separate up and down fermions .",
    "we could then look for entanglement of particles in the position or momentum degrees of freedom , post - selected on having one up and one down . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0k ] ) we see that each term in the superposition has one fermion up and one fermion down , so @xmath103 and the entanglement of particles coincides with the entanglement of modes . since we are guaranteed to have one up and one down , the change between position and momentum bases is a `` local '' change of basis   or @xmath8 each control , even though they are not local in space . ] and the entanglement is therefore independent of this choice .",
    "it is equal to the mode entanglement between the momentum modes , as calculated in  @xcite    it increases from @xmath104 at @xmath105 to @xmath106 as @xmath107 .    the fact that one sees entanglement in position when the particles are distinguished by spin or entanglement in spin when the particles are distinguished by position may be viewed as a type of `` dualism of entanglement '' , as addressed in  @xcite .",
    "thus we see that there is rather subtle structure to the entanglement in the ground state of the hubbard dimer that is not revealed by simply calculating the entanglement of modes .",

    "having studied the behaviour of the entanglement of particles in a few small systems we now move to more - realistic systems containing many particles in many modes .",

    "an idea that has attracted much attention recently from the quantum information theory community is that the improved understanding of entanglement that has been developed may lead to new insights into the physics of strongly - correlated systems in condensed matter .",
    "typically in these systems the particles are itinerant and so must be treated as indistinguishable .",
    "thus if one wishes to explore the role of entanglement one must have a good understanding of what it means for indistinguishable particles to be entangled .",
    "we have argued that in many situations of interest in condensed matter a local particle number superselection rule applies to operations , such as measurements , that can be performed on the system .",
    "thus the notion of entanglement of particles , introduced in  @xcite , may be a more appropriate measure of entanglement to use in studying these systems than the entanglement of modes which appears in many previous studies .",
    "the physical meaning of entanglement of particles is clear  the subsystems that are supposed to be entangled are established by measurement of local particle number by the two parties .",
    "the mathematical entanglement in occupation number ( mode entanglement ) may still display interesting behaviour , however its physical significance is less clear as the measurements that could be performed to observe it are unspecified .    in order to get a feel for how the entanglement of particles compares with the entanglement of modes we began by studying some simple systems that are analytically solvable .",
    "the minimal situation in which entanglement of particles is possible is two particles in four modes .",
    "we found that the entanglement of particles was zero for bosons but non - zero for fermions for two non - interacting particles in a four - mode ring . in both cases",
    "the mode entanglement was non - zero . for the hubbard dimer we calculated the entanglement of particles according to a number of different mode decompositions and compared with previous studies of mode entanglement  @xcite .",
    "finally we studied non - interacting fermions on a lattice and compared with previous results for this system .",
    "we first showed how to write the projected matrix for one fermion on each of two distinct sites in terms of correlation functions . in agreement with previous results regarding the free fermi gas  @xcite we found an `` entanglement length '' in the system beyond which the fermions are not entangled .",
    "it is intriguing that this length extends over multiple lattice sites and persists even when one considers the more restrictive criteria of entanglement of particles where real measurements are considered .",
    "thus the phenomena of entanglement of non - interacting fermions should be experimentally observable , perhaps in optical lattice set - ups where condensed matter hamiltonians may be engineered .",
    "it can not be dismissed as trivially due to the antisymmeterization of the wavefunction and unobservable .",
    "finally we showed precisely how the entanglement of particles relates to the two - spin spin reduced density matrix  @xcite in the continuum limit .",
    "recently there has been interest in studying scaling laws for entanglement entropy in arbitrary dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy corresponds to the entanglement of modes for pure states when entanglement of formation is used as the measure .",
    "an interesting direction for future research would be to see if such scaling laws persist when the more - restrictive criteria of entanglement of particles is used , rather than entanglement of modes .    in conclusion ,",
    "we believe that the entanglement of particles may be a useful concept to consider alongside mode entanglement in studying systems of indistinguishable particles that are central to condensed matter physics .",
    "we have showed that it is physically well - motivated by measurement considerations and leads to distinct phenomenology of entanglement in a few simple systems ."
