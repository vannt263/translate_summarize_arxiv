    "brown dwarfs have been found in increasingly large numbers , particularly in young star - forming regions where their larger luminosities and effective temperatures make them easier to detect .",
    "observations of young substellar objects provide important clues to understanding how brown dwarfs themselves form and , more generally , the nature of the initial mass function . of particular interest is the study of circumsubstellar disks . since disks are the primary conduits of accretion onto stars and the likely birthplaces of planetary systems , characterization of disks around brown dwarfs in comparison to their stellar counterparts is key to constraining formation mechanisms and exploring the range of conditions under which planets may form .",
    "recent investigations by many groups have revealed strong evidence that disk accretion is an important mechanism in brown dwarf formation , apparently identical to the processes that operate in higher - mass t tauri and herbig ae / be stars .",
    "a remarkable similarity exists among objects of widely different masses in terms of both optical and infrared properties associated with the disk accretion process .",

    "disk mass accretion rates ( @xmath1 ) have been measured for brown dwarf disks using a variety of methods including optical veiling ( white & basri 2003 ) , h@xmath2 profile modeling ( muzerolle et al . 2000 , 2003a , 2005 ) , near - infrared emission lines ( natta et al . 2004 ) , and the ca ii triplet ( mohanty et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the derived values are extremely small , typically @xmath3 , demonstrating that most if not all disks around low - mass objects must be irradiation - dominated .",
    "near - infrared excess indicative of optically thick circumstellar disks has been detected around many young substellar objects , although often at a marginal level ( e.g. luhman 1999 ; muench et al .",
    "2001 ; jayawardhana et al .",
    "2003 ; liu et al .",
    "because of the low luminosities of the central sources , the disk excess produced by irradiation is very small and difficult to measure at @xmath4-band and in many cases even at @xmath5-band .",
    "thus , observations at longer wavelengths are necessary to find and characterize disk emission in detail .",

    "these data are part of a larger , more comprehensive _ spitzer _ gto imaging study of the cluster ( lada et al . 2005 ) , a prime target since its stellar and substellar population has been well - characterized from the ground ( e.g. luhman et al .",
    "the mips observations provide the longest - wavelength infrared photometric measurements of brown dwarfs to date , and thus potentially allow much more stringent constraints on brown dwarf disk structure than heretofore possible .",
    "six objects of spectral type m6 and later , near and below the substellar limit , are detected at 24 , exhibiting emission in excess of expected photospheric levels and clearly indicative of emission from circum(sub)stellar disks .",
    "in combination with complementary ground - based optical and near - infrared and _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) observations , we present full seds from @xmath6 to 24 for these six objects .",
    "we calculate models of irradiated accretion disk emission including appropriate ( sub)stellar parameters , and examine their capabilities and limitations in describing the observed seds and constraining disk properties such as surface flaring , inner holes , and dust properties .",
    "we have measured 24 photometry from our gto observations of ic 348 taken in february 2004 with mips ( rieke et al .",

    "data at 70 and 160 were taken simultaneously ; however , we do not consider these here since the sensitivity limits and strong background emission preclude detection of anything but the brightest mid - infrared sources .",

    "daophot_. the 3-sigma detection limit is on average roughly 1 mjy , as high as 10 mjy in the central regions of the cluster where the background is strong and highly structured , and as low as 0.7 mjy in the lowest - background regions of the map . in most cases",
    "the measurement errors are dominated by the 10% uncertainties in the flux calibration .",

    "the low - mass pre - main sequence population has been confirmed primarily via spectroscopic indicators of youth such as h@xmath2 emission , li absorption , and various gravity sensitive features .",
    "here we restrict our analysis to cluster members near or below the substellar limit , selecting only objects with spectral types m6 or later .",

    "the ( sub)stellar properties of the detected objects are listed in table  [ data ] ; the irac and mips fluxes are listed in table  [ spitz ] .",
    "herein , we refer to these 6 objects as the low - mass / substellar 24 sample ( four objects are below the substellar limit according to the baraffe tracks ) . the matching to optical / near - infrared positions in all cases is within about 1 arcsecond , consistent with the typical pointing accuracy of mips .",
    "confusion with red background objects is extremely unlikely ; in the flux range of the sample , extragalactic source counts predict roughly 1 - 10 sources per square degree ( papovich et al .",
    "2004 ) , resulting in a chance alignment probability of @xmath9 .",
    "the 24 detections lie primarily at the outskirts of the cluster , probably reflecting a bias towards lower - background regions of the map where our detection limits are lower .",
    "the 24 fluxes of our low - mass sample are all strongly in excess of expected photospheric levels by factors of 100 or more , not surprising since the sensitivity limit of our observations is too high to detect photospheric or weak excess emission from m dwarfs at the distance of ic 348 .",
    "the large mid - infrared excess luminosity implied by our observations indicates that these objects all harbor significant optically thick disks .",
    "previous detections of accretion activity on at least 2 of the 6 ( l205 and l291 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "2003a , mohanty et al . 2005 ) corroborate this conclusion . since the flux at 24 is completely dominated by the excess emission , it offers optimal new constraints on the properties of disks around very low - mass objects .",
    "inferences of disk structure are greatly dependent on theoretical models , which , as we will show , can be quite degenerate .",
    "however , as an initial guide , we can examine the observed fluxes in comparison with other higher - mass objects and simple theoretical expectations . in figure  [ fratio ]",
    "we show the ratio of the flux at 24 to the flux at 4.5 measured from complementary irac observations ( lada et al .",
    "2005 ; luhman et al .",
    "2005 ) as a function of the 24 flux .",
    "we chose 4.5 as a reference since in most cases it is the shortest wavelength with relatively unambiguous excess emission in the lowest - mass objects ( though there are a few exceptions ; see below ) .",
    "the low - mass / substellar sample spans a range in the flux ratio of about 0.5 dex , roughly a factor of 50 - 100 above the theoretical flux ratio of an m6.5 photosphere . in comparison , we also plot a flux ratio upper limit for a flat , optically thick and geometrically thin disk .",
    "all 6 low - mass / substellar 24 detections lie well above this line , suggesting that the disks are not  flat \" but likely have some amount of flaring .",
    "however , detailed modeling is required to draw more definitive conclusions , as we discuss in the next section .    as a further comparison , figure  [ fratio ] shows the median flux ratio of ic 348 late - type stellar members in the range m4-m5 which exhibit excesses indicative of optically thick disks ( lada et al . 2005 ) .",
    "four of the six objects in our low - mass / substellar sample lie within the one - sigma range of this median ratio , suggesting no significant differences in disk surface structure for these particular objects .",
    "the other objects , l316 and l30003 , exhibit significantly higher flux ratios than the m4-m5 stellar median . a closer look at the sed of l316 , shown in figure  [ sedl316 ] , reveals a lack of excess emission compared to the photosphere at wavelengths shorter than @xmath108 .",
    "a similar result is seen in the sed of l30003 , but with a cut - off at a slightly shorter wavelength .",
    "this behavior indicates a significant depletion of small dust grains , or perhaps no material at all , within the inner @xmath11 au of the disk .",
    "truncated inner disks associated with the magnetospheric disruption or dust destruction radius have been previously diagnosed in t tauri disks on the basis of the near - infrared excess spectrum ( muzerolle et al .",
    "2003b ) , interferometry ( e.g. akeson et al . 2005 ) , and co gas emission lines ( najita et al . 2003 ) . such truncation radii are typically @xmath12 au for typical low - mass ( sub)stellar parameters . however , the inferred  hole \" sizes for l316 and l30003 are much larger , more akin to  transition \" disks found around higher mass stars such as coku tau/4 ( dalessio et al .",
    "2005 ) and tw hya ( calvet et al . 2002 ) , and thus require a different creation mechanism .",
    "we examine several possibilities in detail in section 4.2 .",
    "we next compare the observed infrared emission of each of the low - mass / substellar objects in our sample with detailed vertical structure models of irradiated accretion disks .",
    "the assumptions , equations and description of the method used to calculate the disk structure and emergent intensity are given in dalessio et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 , 2001 ) ; we defer the details to these papers . in brief , the disks are assumed to be in steady - state , with dust and gas well - mixed and thermally coupled and the mass accretion rate uniform throughout the entire disk .",
    "we adopt a viscosity parameter @xmath13 , as is typically assumed for t tauri disks ( but not well - constrained ; see e.g. hartmann et al .",
    "the dust grain size distribution is given by the standard power law @xmath14 ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck , 1977 ) , with minimum grain size @xmath15 and maximum grain size varied to be either @xmath16 ( consistent with ism dust ; dalessio et al .",
    "1999 ) or @xmath17 mm ( the maximum grain size of the model that best fits the median sed of classical t tauri stars in taurus ; dalessio et al . 2001 ) as a preliminary exploration of dust grain growth within these disks .",

    "if an object is actively accreting and has a dust sublimation radius larger than the corotation radius ( as is usually the case ) , a pure gaseous disk must be present interior to @xmath19 . since emission from this component is negligible at low accretion rates ( muzerolle et al .",

    "the maximum disk radius is fixed at @xmath21 au ; no constraints on disk radii are available for the objects under study here , but in any case the model seds are not very sensitive to this parameter in the wavelength range we consider .    for comparison to the observed seds , we adopted ( sub)stellar parameters as shown in table  [ data ] and a distance to ic 348 of 315 pc .",

    "the emission arising from the inner disk wall is required in order to match the fluxes in the 2 - 8 range , while the outer disk is only responsible for the emission redward of @xmath28 ; figure  [ model ] shows the relative contributions of the various components of a typical model .",
    "we find that a disk with @xmath29 , @xmath16 , and an inclination angle of @xmath30 provides reasonable fits for l205 , l291 , and l1707 . in the case of l199",
    ", we can only match the observed sed with @xmath16 for a relatively extreme combination of pole - on disk with small accretion rate @xmath31 .",
    "disks with larger maximum grain sizes up to @xmath17 mm can also fit the observed seds if the accretion rates are increased by one or more orders of magnitude and the inclination angles are changed significantly ( nearly pole - on orientations for l205 , l291 , and l1707 and @xmath30 for l199 ) . to fit the near - infrared fluxes we also have to change the wall height to compensate for the change in model flux as a result of orientation effects ( i.e. , the wall emission decreases as",
    "the inclination becomes more pole - on because of our assumed vertical geometry ) .",
    "the adopted heights are shown in table  [ models ] , along with the expected height given @xmath16 in the wall and equations 5 and 6 from muzerolle et al .",
    "figure  [ model ] compares models with the two maximum grain size extrema ; the overall disk flux is similar in both models owing to the adjustments in @xmath1 and inclination , but the 10 and 20 silicate features , produced in the atmosphere of the outer disk , are markedly weaker for @xmath17 mm ( see also dalessio et al .",
    "spectra of these features are obviously important to discriminate between the two cases .    as already mentioned , objects l316 and l30003 exhibit a lack of excess emission at wavelengths smaller than @xmath32 , indicating a lack of hot dust .",
    "we could not obtain a good fit with any  normal \" disk model , thus , we have calculated the emission from a disk _ truncated _ at radii larger than the dust sublimation radius , following the treatment of muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and dalessio et al .",
    "the inner wall in this case is the transition between an optically thin or completely evacuated hole and an optically thick outer flared disk which contributes to the sed only at longer wavelengths , generally @xmath33 .",
    "again we assume that @xmath16 ; the maximum grain size is varied between 0.25 and 1 mm for the outer disk only .",
    "figure  [ model_hole ] shows the emission components for one such model run for l316 .",
    "the emission redward of 8 is dominated entirely by the vertical wall , which is located near 1 au and hence has a significantly lower surface temperature ( @xmath34 k ) than the dust sublimation point .",
    "we have set @xmath35 yr@xmath36 for models of both l316 and l30003 , but observational constraints are lacking .",
    "this level is probably an upper limit for l316 since its small h@xmath2 equivalent width ( 3  ) indicates either very weak or completely blocked accretion onto the central object .",
    "comparisons of disks around low - mass stars and brown dwarfs can in principle provide clues to differences or similarities in formation mechanisms , as well as put limits on the possibility of planet formation .",
    "mid - infrared measurements probe dust emission from the terrestrial zone of disks and provide a useful point of comparison for investigating bulk dust properties",
    ". of particular interest has been the detection of infrared signatures of disk evolution via grain growth and settling .",
    "evidence for such processes has been inferred for  mature \" t tauri disks at ages of up to 5 - 10 myr ( calvet et al . 2005a ; sicilia - aguilar et al . 2005 ) . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", previous measurements of thermal dust emission from a small number of brown dwarfs have indicated a range of disk properties , from surface flaring and dust grain sizes typical of most 1 myr - old t tauri stars to flatter disks with evidence for significant dust grain growth and settling towards the disk midplane .",
    "these inferences are based primarily on observed fluxes out to 14 and rough silicate emission strengths from narrow - band 10 imaging ( apai et al . 2004 ; mohanty et al .",
    "2004 ; sterzik et al .",
    "our 24 observations potentially offer an even more sensitive indicator of the disk surface geometry since they probe a more distant range of disk radii ( roughly 0.5 - 1 au for a central substellar object ) where the disk height is up to 30% greater ( dalessio et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the flux ratios shown in figure  [ fratio ] suggest that the disks in our sample are not flat but must have some amount of flaring , to a degree not dissimilar to that seen in the low - mass stellar population of ic 348 in general .",
    "lada et al .",
    "( 2005 ) compare stellar seds as a function of spectral type and find that the latest - type stars ( @xmath37m4 ) with disks exhibit steeper spectral slopes than seen in earlier - type stars with disks , possibly indicating a higher frequency of dust settling around lower - mass objects .",
    "however , our disk model comparisons indicate that we can not easily constrain the dust properties for most of the low - mass / substellar sample . without additional information such as the mass accretion rate or the 10 and 18 silicate features , the observed excess emission out to 24",
    "can be explained by a wide range of maximum dust grain sizes , from ism - type to as large as 1 mm .",
    "observational constraints on the disk mass accretion rates are available only for l205 ( @xmath38 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "2003a ) and l291 ( an upper limit of @xmath39 ; mohanty et al .",
    "these would seem to argue against the @xmath16 model for l205 since the model accretion rate is a factor of 10 lower .",
    "if this is the case , we may be seeing evidence of grain growth in the l205 disk .",
    "for object l199 , the @xmath16 model only fits for rather extreme values of @xmath1 ( small ) and inclination ( pole - on ) , which may not be realistic particularly since pole - on orientations should be statistically rare .",
    "similarly , the @xmath17 mm models may not hold for l291 and l1707 since they also require pole - on orientations .",
    "one suggestion of dust settling may be seen in the vertical heights of the inner disk wall component of the models .",
    "the heights required to match the short - wavelength excess of objects l199 and l205 are factors of 1.5 - 2 smaller than the expected heights derived from equation 6 of muzerolle et al .",
    "it is possible that grain growth and settling in the inner disk can result in smaller than expected wall heights .",
    "however , the exact values constrained by our models are limited by uncertainties in the level of the underlying photosphere ( see table  [ models ] ) as well as the uncertain structure of the inner wall .",
    "models incorporating the wall with the outer disk in a self - consistent manner , including the effects of dust settling to the disk midplane , must be explored before definitive conclusions can be made . again , mid - infrared spectra covering the silicate features are also crucial observational constraints that should be obtained .",
    "we further caution that all the  normal \" disk models presented here implicitly assume that the wall radius is at the dust sublimation point . given the cool and faint radiation fields of very low - mass objects , the sublimation radius is quite small ( table  [ models ] ) and may in fact be smaller than the radius at which the ( sub)stellar magnetosphere truncates the gas disk",
    ". if this is the case , the dust edge should then be at the magnetospheric radius and can have a dust temperature less than 1400 k , yielding weaker near - infrared excess emission ( a lower temperature might also provide a better fit to the spectral slope at the irac bands in l205 ) . since estimates for the magnetospheric truncation radii are highly uncertain , we leave this complication for a future study .",
    "we must also point out that all of the models we consider here assume the same constant value of the viscosity parameter @xmath2 .",
    "the model sed at @xmath40 can be modified significantly if @xmath2 is changed by just an order of magnitude .",
    "there is no theoretical nor observational impediment , at this time , to adopting different values of @xmath2 . for smaller values ,",
    "the disk density will increase assuming a constant @xmath1 , since @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the temperature at the disk midplane . if the density increases , the height of the irradiation surface , defined as the height where the mean optical depth to the ( sub)stellar radiation is unity , also increases .",
    "the higher the irradiation surface , the larger the fraction of incident ( sub)stellar flux is intercepted and reprocessed by the disk . on the other hand , the mean opacity to the ( sub)stellar radiation is smaller with increasing @xmath27 from ism - like values to millimeter sizes .",
    "thus , different combinations of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath27 can fit the same sed .",
    "a full exploration of the effects on the structure of disks around very low mass objects produced by varying @xmath2 are beyond the scope of this work . in any case , 10 spectra and millimeter observations are required for a more rigorous test of the grain growth hypothesis for objects l199 and l205 .",
    "models including the effects of dust settling to the disk midplane should also be explored .",
    "two objects , l316 and l30003 , show evidence for inner disk clearing beyond what could be explained by magnetospheric truncation or the dust destruction radius alone .",
    "l316 is the first young brown dwarf known to exhibit a significant inner disk  hole \" .",
    "this result has potentially significant impact on our understanding of disk clearing mechanisms since the low object masses provide stringent constraints on theoretical models previously proposed to explain similar  transition \" disks around higher - mass young stars .",
    "we discuss two possibilities , photoevaporation by the uv flux of the central object and clearing via grain growth or planet formation .",
    "clarke et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , building on the pioneering work of hollenbach et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , first proposed a photoevaporative wind as a means of producing inside - out clearing of circumstellar accretion disks . in brief , the model treats mass loss from the disk surface as a result of photoevaporation caused by the impinging uv radiation of the central star .",
    "this loss occurs beyond a characteristic  gravitational radius \" ( @xmath43 ) that depends on the mass of the central object and the sound speed of the photoionized gas . as the disk viscously evolves with time its mass accretion rate decreases steadily ; once the accretion rate drops below the photoevaporative mass loss rate , the disk experiences a net loss of material outside @xmath43 .",
    "a gap quickly forms at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 au for typical t tauri stellar parameters ) , and the continuing mass loss prevents replenishment by accreting material from outside .",
    "the inner disk , now decoupled at @xmath43 , drains onto the star in a viscous time ( a few times @xmath45 yrs for typical t tauri stars ) , leaving a hole in the disk of size @xmath43 .",
    "the outer disk then continues to evaporate away more slowly .    the main difficulty with this model has been the origin of sufficient uv flux .",
    "matsuyama et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed the excess hot continuum produced by typical t tauri accretion shocks does not produce enough uv flux , particularly when the decrease in mass accretion rate with time expected by viscous evolution is folded in .",
    "we can now place more stringent constraints on the timescales for this process to operate by inference from the very low - mass objects which show inner disk clearing .",
    "in particular , the hole radius we infer for object l316 with the @xmath17 mm model is similar to the gravitational radius @xmath46 au , where @xmath47 is the sound speed of the ionized gas with assumed @xmath48 k. ruden ( 2004 ) gives useful scaling relations for the photoevaporative mass loss using a framework similar to that of matsuyama et al . , assuming that the accretion shock is the only source of significant euv photons and emits blackbody radiation with characteristic temperature 15,000 k. most applicable for our purposes is the characteristic timescale for disk removal , @xmath49 , and the total mass removed , @xmath50 .",
    "we adopt an initial disk mass @xmath51 as a plausible upper limit , at the high end of the range measured in t tauri stars and close to the limit for gravitational instability .",
    "the only published disk mass measurements for substellar objects are from klein et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who estimated values in the range 0.4 - 2.4 and 1.7 - 5.7 @xmath52 for the brown dwarfs cfht - bd - tau 4 and ic 348 613 , respectively . ] , and a viscosity parameter @xmath13 . with these assumptions",
    ", we estimate that a total of only @xmath53 can be removed via a photoevaporative wind in about 300 myr , some 300 times longer than the age of the object .",
    "smaller values of @xmath2 will only increase the evaporative timescale ; smaller initial disk masses will decrease the timescale but also vastly decrease the mass removed .",
    "thus , we conclude that a photoevaporative wind generated by uv radiation from a substellar accretion shock can not have produced the inner disk hole we see in l316 .",
    "in fact , there may be no accretion shock at all on l316 if accretion has indeed shut off , as its h@xmath2 equivalent width seems to suggest ( though a resolved line profile would provide a better indicator ) .",
    "an alternative source of the uv flux may arise from the chromosphere ; however , it would need to provide a steady flux of @xmath54 s@xmath36 ( ruden 2004 ) , which is difficult to imagine for such a low - mass object .",
    "however , measurements of the chromospheric uv flux in young objects of any mass are lacking .",
    "significant grain growth and settling in the inner disk may lead naturally to rapid formation of meter or kilometer - sized planetesimals .",
    "models of dust coagulation in protoplanetary disks predict growth at a rate proportional to the square of the orbital period , with faster timescales in the inner disk because of the higher velocities ( e.g. weidenschilling 1997 ) .",
    "recent simulations along these lines by dullemond & dominik ( 2005 ) demonstrated that small grains can be removed quickly from the inner regions of t tauri disks , so long as they are not replenished .",
    "in fact , the process appears to act too quickly , in less than 1 myr , and replenishment by aggregate fragmentation from high speed collisions was suggested by dullemond & dominik as a way to extend disk lifetimes to agree with observations .",
    "larger scale effects associated with the dissipation of the gas in the disk may also cause planetesimal orbits to shift and create additional collisions since the system will never reach a static state until the gas is gone .",
    "other proposed mechanisms for the removal of small dust grains in disks around low - mass stars , such as corpuscular wind drag ( plavchan et al . 2005 ) , only apply once the gas has completely dispersed .",
    "therefore , the attribution of cleared inner disks to clearing by planet formation brings its own set of complications .",
    "it may mean a system of planetesimals akin to the asteroid belt within the cleared inner zone at a time away from major collision events , or it may suggest the very rapid formation of a massive planet within a few au of the central object , as has been suggested for t tauri stars with similar evidence for inner disk holes such as tw hya ( calvet et al . 2002 ) , gm aur ( rice et al .",
    "2003 ; calvet et al .",
    "2005b ) , and coku tau/4 ( dalessio et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the case of l316 may illustrate the latter of these possibilities .",
    "accretion has probably ceased altogether , and if so there is likely little or no gas inside the hole . in order to prevent accretion from the outer disk from proceeding through the hole onto the star , dynamical perturbation from a planetary - mass object might be required .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations by quillen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have shown that planetary companions around young stars can disrupt the inner disk and prevent further accretion from the outer disk if they are sufficiently massive .",
    "they estimate this lower limit in the case of the inner disk hole - bearing t tauri star coku tau/4 using the gap - formation criterion that the ratio of the planetary and primary masses @xmath55 re@xmath36 , where the reynolds number @xmath56 is a function of the disk viscosity ( nelson et al . 2000 ) . for the @xmath2-disk prescription , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the keplerian velocity of a particle at a given radius in the disk and @xmath59 is the sound speed at the same radius . in the case of object l316",
    ", we adopt an inner hole size of 1 au , the temperature at the disk edge @xmath60 k , and the keplerian velocity at the edge given the mass of l316 .",
    "assuming @xmath61 , we then derive a rough lower limit @xmath62 for the planetary mass necessary to maintain the observed hole .",
    "the initial disk around l316 most likely did not have enough material within 0.5 - 1 au to form a planet this large .",
    "we have simulated a possible initial disk using a standard model with @xmath61 , inner edge at the dust sublimation radius , and a much larger accretion rate of @xmath63 ( a plausible initial value based on the observed range of accretion rates in brown dwarfs ; muzerolle et al .",
    "the resulting model contains about 2 - 3 @xmath64 of total dust+gas inside 0.5 au .",
    "however , @xmath2 is not known ; values of @xmath65 are theoretically plausible and would give smaller lower limits to the planetary mass necessary to maintain the inner hole , @xmath66 , as well as more mass in the initial disk .",
    "a lower @xmath2 could for instance be indicative of a disk in which the midplane is inactive (  dead zone \" ; gammie 1996 ) , with very low or zero equivalent @xmath2 , and accretion occurs only in an active layer with larger @xmath2 . the same initial disk model with these smaller values of @xmath2 results in disk masses within 0.5 au of up to 60 @xmath67 .",
    "thus , a sufficient reservoir of material could have been present around l316 initially for this scenario to hold . however , the mean age of ic 348 members then requires a fast planet formation timescale of a few myr or less",
    ". the surface densities of the initial disk models are too low by several orders of magnitude for the disk instability model of boss ( 1997 ) to apply .",
    "more work needs to be done to evaluate whether the traditional models of core formation ( or even `` super - earth '' formation ) via planetesimal collisions can build an object in the mass range we estimate in the time required .",
    "we have reported on the detection at 24 of dust emission from 6 very low mass or substellar members of the 1 - 3 myr - old cluster ic 348 .",
    "the amount of excess emission in all cases is consistent with an origin in optically thick disks . in combination with ground - based and _ spitzer _ irac photometry",
    ", we find that the sed shapes of four objects are similar to those of most of the disks around m stars in the same cluster , indicating similar flared disk geometries .",
    "models of irradiated accretion disks with maximum grain sizes no larger than 1 millimeter fit the seds , however , in most cases we can not confidently rule out smaller maximum grain sizes .",
    "measurements of mass accretion rates , spectra of the 10 silicate feature , and/or millimeter - wave observations are needed to better constrain the models .",
    "the two objects with dissimilar seds exhibit a lack of excess emission shortward of 5 - 8 indicative of evacuated inner holes .",
    "our models constrain the size of the inner hole in object l316 to @xmath68 0.5 - 1 au .",
    "this is the first brown dwarf seen to exhibit evidence for a transition disk with an au - scale inner hole .",
    "processes related to planet formation may have contributed to the clearing of the inner disk , either via planetesimal coagulation to asteroid - size bodies or formation of a single `` super - earth '' .",
    "if true , this suggests that planet formation can occur around objects across the full range of stellar and substellar masses , and puts strong constraints on the formation timescale of a few myr or less .",
    "further models of grain growth and planetesimal coagulation in such environments need to be advanced in order to assess these possibilities , or whether a different clearing mechanism is required .",
