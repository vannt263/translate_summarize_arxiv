    "in an x - ray image obtained with rosat , the vela supernova remnant ( snr ) is roughly circular with a diameter @xmath10 @xcite . at a distance of 250  pc @xcite",
    "this corresponds to about 35  pc .",
    "six bow shaped `` knots '' of emission lie beyond the nominal circumference of the remnant .",
    "the shape and location of these knots led aschenbach et al .  to suggest that they were due to ejecta `` bullets '' that had overtaken the blast wave .",
    "of the six features , the closest to the remnant and also the brightest in x - ray is `` knot d '' .",
    "the optical nebula rcw  37 @xcite , lies along the outer edge of knot d. this association with bright optical filaments also distinguishes knot d from the other five knots .",
    "although it is grouped with the ejecta bullets , there are two other explanations for the origin of knot d. one scenario , suggested by @xcite is that knot d is a shock that has broken out from the vela snr due to inhomogeneities in the ambient medium .",
    "they analyzed _",
    "chandra_-acis spectra of knot d and found that the oxygen abundance was solar and that the neon abundance was modestly enhanced , and they found no evidence for abundance differences at different locations in the knot .",
    "these results as well as the morphology of the x - ray emission led @xcite to favor a shock break - out origin for knot d. the other suggestion @xcite is that knot d is associated with rxj0852.0 - 4622 , a remnant that in projection is within the boundaries of the vela snr .",
    "they analyzed optical echelle data of rcw  37 and found a velocity split near the bright optical edge in both [ s  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission , and an almost complete velocity ellipse across the nebula in the latter .",
    "they inferred that the geometry of the optical nebula is either an incomplete funnel or a wavy sheet .",
    "based on the kinematic structure of emission as well as the optical and x - ray morphologies of the nebula they suggested that an outflow from rxj0852.0 - 4622 impacted the pre - existing wall of the vela snr to produce knot d. as they point out , for their model to work both remnants have to be at about the same distance @xcite .",
    "regardless of its origin , it is known that knot d is a source of shock excited emission .",
    "@xcite presented far - ultraviolet observations of the region obtained with the _ voyager 2 _ ultraviolet spectrometer .",
    "strong emission from c  iii  @xmath6977 and o  vi  @xmath21032,1038 was detected in the spectrum .",
    "the authors noted the sheet - like morphology of the filaments and the spatial coincidence of the x - ray and optical emission and argued that these were characteristics of a shock - cloud interaction ( such as had been seen in the cygnus loop snr ) and that this interaction produced the ultraviolet lines as well as the optical emission .",
    "they suggested that the large _ voyager _ fov included shocks with a range of velocities , and that @xmath11  km  s@xmath5 shocks were responsible for the c  iii emission and 160300  km  s@xmath5 shocks produced the o  vi emission .    in this paper",
    "we take a detailed look at the shock - cloud interaction and determine the shock wave paramaters .",
    "our results throw some light on the nature of knot d , but do not unambiguously determine its origin .",
    "we use ultraviolet spectra obtained with the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ ( hut ) and with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) .",
    "these data have much higher spectral resolution than the _ voyager _ spectrum and the aperture fovs are over a thousand times smaller",
    ". we also present optical longslit spectra of the filaments .",
    "we confirm that the optical emission is shock excited . by comparing the measured far - ultraviolet emission line strengths with shock model predictions , we find the properties of the shocks around knot d. the kinematic distribution of the emission around the bow shock is clearly revealed in the high resolution fuse data .",
    "the observations are described in  2 , and the results presented in  3 .",
    "then , in  4 we analyze the results and present our interpretation .",
    "the last section ,  5 summarizes the central results of this work and presents some of the issues yet to be answered .",
    "images of the region of interest are shown in figure [ f_image ] .",
    "the top panel is a three color image of the southern half of knot d. narrowband h@xmath3 and [ o  iii ]  @xmath65007 images ( first presented by @xcite ) are shown in red and green , respectively .",
    "the blue is the _ chandra _ x - ray image , presented by @xcite ( and kindly provided to us by the lead author ) .",
    "overlaid on the image are the locations of the fuse lwrs and mdrs apertures .",
    "the bottom panel is a two color image of a region around the bright filament .",
    "only the optical emission is shown ( h@xmath3 in red , [ o  iii ] in green ) overlaid with the hut and fuse lwrs aperture positions .",
    "the hut observations were made during the astro-2 space shuttle mission on 1995 march 15 .",
    "( the basic hut design is described by @xcite , and the improvements to the instrument for astro-2 by @xcite . )",
    "the wavelength coverage of hut was 820 ",
    "1840  with a resolution of @xmath12  3 .",
    "the 56@xmath1310  aperture was centered at @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and placed at a position angle of 18 which aligned the aperture with the optical filament . after approximately 1000 s of exposure time at this position , the aperture was offset to a location @xmath1230  east , perpendicular to the aperture s long dimension .",
    "we refer to these positions as p1 and p2 , respectively ( figure [ f_image]b ) .",
    "the data were obtained in a time - tag mode which allowed the separation of orbital day and night photons .",
    "since the daytime photons are contaminated by airglow emission , only the nighttime data are used here .",
    "the effective exposure times are 932  s for p1 and 1162  s for p2 .",
    "the hut data were processed using an iraf package originally developed to process hut data from the astro-1 mission , and described by @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration applied to these data is based on in - orbit observations of white dwarf stars fitted with theoretical models .",
    "other corrections , such as pulse persistence , dark count and ly@xmath3 scattering have been characterized and included here @xcite .",
    "the fuse observation ( program i d b1080201 ) was obtained on 2001 april 2 as part of a guest investigator project to study the vela - puppis region .",
    "eleven exposures with a total integration time of 14,133 s were obtained with the low resolution ( lwrs ) 30@xmath1330  aperture centered at @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "this position is the same as the center of the hut p1 observation , and lies on the bright optical filament ( figure  [ f_image]b ) .",
    "data were obtained simultaneously through the medium resolution ( mdrs ) 20@xmath134  aperture .",
    "the mdrs aperture was located 208  away , 24  west of north from the lwrs aperture on an x - ray bright region away from the bright optical emission ( figure  [ f_image]a ) .",
    "the wavelength range covered by fuse is 905  1187 . in this paper",
    "we present data from segments sic2a ( @xmath12905  1000 ) , lif1a ( @xmath121000  1100 ) and lif2a ( @xmath121100  1187 ) , the segments with largest effective area in their wavelength ranges @xcite .",
    "the data in other segments were used for comparison to distinguish between real features and possible detector artifacts .",
    "the raw data from all the exposures were combined and the pipeline calfuse version 1.8.7 was used to produce calibrated spectra .",
    "a shift was applied to the lif1a and sic2a flux vectors to line up the geocoronal emission ( ly@xmath16 and ly@xmath17 respectively for the two channels ) at the appropriate wavelength in the heliocentric frame of reference .",
    "this was done for both lwrs and mdrs spectra .",
    "the source is an extended emission object and fills the apertures .",
    "for such a target , the effective spectral resolution is a combination of the instrumental resolution ( @xmath120.05 ) , the slit width , and a further degradation caused by detector astigmatism @xcite .",
    "the width of the airglow lines in a spectrum is a measure of the effective spectral resolution . in our data ,",
    "the effective spectral resolutions are @xmath120.34  for the lwrs data and @xmath120.09  for the mdrs data .",
    "( these numbers correspond to about 100  km  s@xmath5 and 30  km  s@xmath5 , respectively , at 1000 . )",
    "the longslit optical spectra presented here were obtained in 1989 february at las campanas observatory .",
    "the observations used the du pont 2.5  m telescope , the modular spectrograph and an @xmath18 pixel ti ccd .",
    "a 600  line  mm@xmath5 5000  blaze grating was used with an 85  mm camera , providing spectral coverage , 4750 ",
    "7150  at 3.0  per pixel .",
    "the slit width was 2  and the effective spectral resolution was 8 .",
    "the spatial scale along the slit was 08  pixel@xmath5 , with a usable slit length of 7 .",
    "the slit was placed along the east - west direction , passing through the optical filaments @xmath19  below the slit center of the hut position p1 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard iraf procedures , including bias subtraction , flat fielding , image rectification and extraction of one dimensional spectra .",
    "the background was determined from a portion of the slit lying outside the remnant and subtracted from the spectra .",
    "the flux calibration was done using observations of standard stars from the list of @xcite .",
    "fiducial stars along the slit , and the known spatial scale were used to extract regions of the long slit data corresponding to the intersection of the slit with the hut apertures . the optical images ( figure [ f_image]b ) show that the emission is fairly uniform within the apertures , so the optical spectra should be representative of the overall emission within the hut apertures at p1 and p2 .",
    "the optical narrowband images show a striated emission structure .",
    "there are bands of green ( strong [ o  iii ] ) , yellow ( strong [ o  iii ] and h@xmath3 ) and red ( strong h@xmath3 ) running parallel to the shock front ( figure  [ f_image]b ) , indicating a systematic variation of the h@xmath3 to [ o  iii ] flux ratio .",
    "the h@xmath3 emission is at its brightest in the region between about 50  and 70  behind the leading [ o  iii ] edge .",
    "the [ o  iii ] emission reaches its peak at about the same location as the h@xmath3 ( @xmath20 behind the edge ) . in the green ( [ o  iii ] dominated ) band of emission , the [ o  iii ] flux is about 40% of its peak value , while the h@xmath3 flux remains below 20% of its peak value .",
    "the brightest optical filaments lie approximately parallel to the southeast edge of the x - ray emitting region ( figure  [ f_image]a ) and there is a gap of about 1  between the x - ray edge and the filaments .",
    "observations of other shock - cloud interactions in the cygnus loop @xcite and in vela @xcite have shown that optical filaments are typically coincident with the edges of bright x - ray features , and not separated as in knot d. so though the association of x - ray and optical regions is expected in snr shocks , the existence of a gap between the two is surprising .",
    "the optical spectra of the regions of bright and faint h@xmath3 ( p1 and p2 , respectively ) are shown in figure  [ f_opt ] .",
    "we measured the integrated line fluxes using the iraf task , ` splot ` , and calculated the surface brightnesses .",
    "we derive the color excess from the observed ratio between between the h@xmath3 and h@xmath16 fluxes .",
    "the intrinsic ratio between the two lines for shock excited emission is 3.0 @xcite .",
    "the observed ratio at p1 , i@xmath21/i@xmath22 , implies that @xmath23 , a value consistent with those obtained for other regions in vela @xcite . at position",
    "p2 , we only have an upper limit for the h@xmath16 flux and can not estimate the color excess .",
    "therefore we assume that the p1 value applies to the whole region .",
    "we used the extinction curve suggested by @xcite , and total to visual selective extinction @xmath24 to calculate correction factors for all the lines .",
    "the surface brightnesses of the optical lines , corrected for interstellar extinction are presented in table  [ tbl_opt ] .    the brightness ratio , i@xmath25}}$]/i@xmath21 is greater than 1 at both positions p1 and p2 .",
    "the high ratios imply that the gas is collisionally excited and confirm that the optical filaments are due to shocks .",
    "as expected from the narrowband images , the optical spectra at the two positions differ significantly in the strength of [ o  iii ] emission relative to emission from the lower ionization lines .",
    "the [ o  iii ]  @xmath24959,5007 flux is about 3 times weaker at position p2 than at p1 , whereas all the other lines are about an order of magnitude weaker at p2 .",
    "some lines , including [ o  i ]  @xmath26300,6364 are not detected at the latter position .",
    "this difference suggests that at p2 , the shock is `` incomplete '' - it has not yet swept up enough material for the post - shock gas to have recombined and produced strong h@xmath3 , [ s  ii ] and other low ionization lines .",
    "the hut spectra of the two positions in knot d contain numerous emission lines expected from snr shocks ( figure  [ f_hut ] ) . as expected from the _ voyager _ uvs spectrum @xcite , c  iii  @xmath6977 and o  vi  @xmath21032,1038 are the strongest lines below 1200 .",
    "other lines such as n  iii  @xmath6991 , which were lost in the low resolution _ voyager _",
    "spectrum , are detected in these hut data .",
    "longward of 1200 , the strongest lines are c  iv  @xmath61549 , o  iii ]  @xmath61663 and n  iii ]  @xmath61751 .",
    "many ( but not all ) of the detected lines are marked in figure  [ f_hut ] .",
    "one surprise is that n  v  @xmath61240 is relatively weak : in spectra of radiative shocks in the cygnus loop the line is comparable in strength to the c  iv line @xcite .",
    "the integrated line fluxes in the spectra were measured using the iraf tasks ` splot ` and the more sophisticated ` specfit ` @xcite , the latter for blended lines .",
    "the pair of lines , si  iv  @xmath61402 and o  iv ]  @xmath61403 could not be deblended automatically .",
    "therefore , it was assumed that the si  iv  @xmath61402 flux was exactly half the si  iv  @xmath61394 flux ( valid for optically thin emission ) .",
    "this amount was subtracted from the measured flux of the 1403  feature and added to the 1394  line .",
    "the surface brightnesses of the lines , corrected for interstellar extinction , are listed in table  [ tbl_hut ] along with the correction factors .",
    "it should be noted that the interstellar extinction curve at wavelengths below 1000  is poorly known and is the main source of uncertainties in the intrinsic brightness of the shortest wavelength lines .",
    "the line strengths at p1 are about twice those at p2 , but apart from that overall factor the spectra at the two positions are similar .",
    "the dramatic differences in the relative intensities of optical lines are not present for the ultraviolet lines .",
    "this implies that the shock conditions are similar at the two positions .",
    "for instance i@xmath26/i@xmath27}1664}$ ] , a ratio that is very sensitive to the maximum temperature reached behind the shock , is @xmath28 at p1 and @xmath29 at p2 .",
    "thus the far - ultraviolet spectra support the idea that the difference in the optical emission between p1 and p2 is due to different levels of shock completeness , rather than differences in shock velocity .",
    "the main difference between the hut p1 and p2 spectra is the ratio between the two o  vi doublet lines : i@xmath30/i@xmath31 at p1 and @xmath32 at p2",
    ". the ratio approaches 0.5 when the line optical depth tends to zero , and approaches 1.0 when the line is optically thick .",
    "the measured ratios show that the line fluxes are affected by resonance line scattering and that the effect is stronger at p1 than at p2",
    ".    the ratio between the o  vi line fluxes can be affected by absorption of the 1038  line by molecular hydrogen ( the lyman band transitions , r(1)@xmath33 and p(1)@xmath33 , at 1037.15  and 1038.16 , respectively ) and by c  ii * ( 1037.02 ) .",
    "the ratio can also be affected by self - absorption of the lines by o  vi in the ism .",
    "@xcite find the column of low velocity h@xmath34 in the j=1 state @xmath35 , 10@xmath36 , and 10@xmath37 towards three stars behind vela .",
    "even the highest of these would absorb only about 9% of the flux from a 150  km  s@xmath5 width line centered at zero velocity .",
    "the more typical lower values for the column would have negligible effect on the o  vi  @xmath61038 flux .",
    "the c  ii * line is stronger , but is at @xmath38  km  s@xmath5 relative to the o  vi  @xmath61038 rest wavelength .",
    "the velocity profile of the o  vi lines in the fuse lwrs spectrum ( see below ) shows that c  ii * absorption would not reduce the o  vi flux significantly . the o  vi column out to the distance of vela ( 250  pc ) is @xmath39  @xmath40 @xcite , which would have negligible affect on the line fluxes .",
    "also , knot d lies beyond the remnant boundary , and it is unlikely that other shocked clouds associated with vela lie in front of it .",
    "therefore , the ratios measured in the hut spectra should not be modified significantly by foreground absorption .",
    "the fuse lwrs spectrum is shown in figure  [ f_fuse ] .",
    "the strongest snr lines in the fuse bandpass are c  iii  @xmath6977 and o  vi  @xmath21032,1038 .",
    "these lines are allowed to go off - scale in the plot in order to show a number of the weaker lines present in the spectrum .",
    "the weak lines are well separated from each other and are easily identified .",
    "furthermore , snr lines can be distinguished from airglow lines by comparing the total spectrum with a spectrum screened to include only orbital night data .",
    "many of these weaker lines have been detected in snr spectra for the first time by fuse .",
    "for example , this paper reports the first such detection of s  iii  @xmath61077 .",
    "note that the region around he  ii@xmath41[n  ii ]  @xmath61085 is not included in the plots .",
    "this range lies at the edge of only one detector segment @xcite , and the telescope effective area is very small in this region .",
    "the total line fluxes in the lwrs spectrum were obtained by trapezoidal integration of the flux vector with suitable background subtraction .",
    "the strong lines contain several thousand counts , so the random errors in their measured fluxes are low ( @xmath12  1% ) .",
    "the errors are about 6% for some of the weaker lines , such as s  iii  @xmath61015 and s  iv  @xmath61063 . for the weakest line fluxes , particularly those detected in the sic  2a segment ( e.g.  s  vi  @xmath2933 , 944 ) , uncertainties in the background placement contribute to the total error , which is about 20% .",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration is about 10% @xcite , which dominates the statistical errors in the measured fluxes of the strong lines and is comparable to those of the weak lines .",
    "the surface brightnesses of the lines , corrected for interstellar extinction , are presented in table  [ tbl_lwrs ] .",
    "the fluxes of the strong lines ( c  iii and o  vi ) plotted on a velocity scale are shown in figure  [ f_lw ] .",
    "( the velocity is relative to the local standard of rest , in which frame the sun is moving away from vela at about 12.5  km  s@xmath5 . )",
    "the top panel is an overlay of the two o  vi lines .",
    "the lines are centered at @xmath42  km  s@xmath5 and the fwhm of each line is @xmath43  km  s@xmath5 . if the emission fills the slit uniformly , then the observed line profile is the intrinsic profile convolved with the line spread function , which , to very good approximation , is a 106  km  s@xmath5 wide `` tophat '' function . under this assumption",
    "the o  vi lines have intrinsic fwhms of @xmath44  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the surface brightnesses of the o  vi in the fuse lwrs spectrum lies between the hut p1 and p2 values ( tables  [ tbl_hut ] , [ tbl_lwrs ] ) .",
    "however , the ratio i@xmath30/i@xmath45 in the fuse lwrs spectrum , which is lower than the value at either hut position .",
    "thus , when detected over the more spatially extended lwrs aperture , resonance scattering has a smaller effect on the o  vi emission than when detected over the hut aperture at p1 or p2 .",
    "the feature on the blue wing of o  vi  @xmath61038 is identified as c  ii  @xmath61037.02 , a line also detected in a fuse spectrum of an x - ray bright knot in the center of vela @xcite .",
    "the transition leading to the 1037.02  line has a lower state 63  cm@xmath5 above the ground state .",
    "the companion line , c  ii  @xmath61036.34 is a strong ground state transition @xcite and is not detected because it is absorbed by the interstellar gas between us and the snr .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ f_lw ] shows an overlay of the c  iii and the o  vi  @xmath61032 lines .",
    "the c  iii line is significantly broader than the o  vi line , and it has a central reversal . by fitting the wings of the c  iii profile with gaussians",
    "we find that the observed peaks are centered at @xmath47  km  s@xmath5 and @xmath48  km  s@xmath5 , and that the components have fwhms @xmath4  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "c  iii is a strong resonance line , and while the observed profile is consistent with there being two kinematic components , we expect optical depth effects to influence the line profile .",
    "some idea about the intrinsic velocity distribution of low ionization emission is gleaned from the [ s  ii ]  @xmath66716 position - velocity data presented by @xcite . in an echelle spectrum with the slit cutting across the optical filament about 2  south of the fuse lwrs position , @xcite detected bright [ s  ii ] emission around zero - velocity .",
    "in addition to this central component , they found fainter red - shifted and blue - shifted peaks ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "the intrinsic velocity structure of the c  iii emission is likely to be as complex , in which case the reversal in the observed profile is due to zero - velocity emission being self - absorbed by both filament material and the ism along the sightline .",
    "c  iii  @xmath6977 and the o  vi doublet are detected in the fuse mdrs spectrum , obtained at a position several arcminutes behind the bright optical filaments .",
    "the line fluxes are plotted against lsr velocity in figure  [ f_md ] .",
    "the two o  vi lines track each other closely ( figure  [ f_md ] top panel ) .",
    "each o  vi line profile has two peaks , centered at @xmath49  km  s@xmath5 and @xmath48  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the width of the gap between the two components is about 90  km  s@xmath5 , which is much greater than the typical velocity width @xmath50  km  s@xmath5 for absorption by interstellar o  vi @xcite .",
    "we conclude that we are seeing two distinct emitting components ( rather than a single , self - absorbed component ) along the line of sight at this location .",
    "the kinematic structure of the c  iii emission follows that of the o  vi emission ( figure  [ f_md ] bottom panel ) .",
    "the c  iii line has two peaks , centered at the same velocities as the o  vi lines .",
    "the separation between the two c  iii velocity components is larger in the the mdrs spectrum than in the lwrs spectrum .",
    "because of its bow shape , and because of the lack of complex optical morphology at the location of the mdrs aperture ( figure  [ f_image ] ) , we conclude that the two emission components are due to shocks on the front and back sides of knot d. the blue - shifted o  vi lines have fwhms of about 70  km  s@xmath5 , and are broader than their red - shifted counterparts , which are about 50  km  s@xmath5 wide ( fwhm ) .",
    "both c  iii components have fwhms of about 50  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "the surface brightnesses , corrected for interstellar extinction , of the blue and red shifted components of the three lines are presented in table  [ tbl_mdrs ] .",
    "the blue shifted component of c  iii  @xmath6977 is about 1.3 times as bright as the red shifted component .",
    "in contrast , the total o  vi flux of the blue shifted component is just half that of the red shifted component .",
    "i@xmath51/i@xmath52 is about 0.9 for the red shifted component and about 0.4 for the blue shifted component .",
    "the ratios between the doublet lines , i@xmath30/i@xmath53 are 0.54 for the blue shifted component and 0.56 for the red shifted component .",

    "the difference is probably due to the curvature of the shock front into the plane of the sky , but could also be because the cloud that the shock is running into is approximately cylindrical with its long direction oriented in the plane of the sky .",
    "as we showed above , the high ionization lines are produced by faster shocks .",
    "for a 180  km  s@xmath5 shock , the isobaric condition yields a pre - shock density @xmath80  @xmath1 .    at the fuse mdrs position , the observed o  vi to c  iii ratios are 0.4 for the blue - shifted component and 0.9 for the red - shifted component ( table  [ tbl_mdrs ] ) .",

    "the dynamical pressure of the shock derived above is about twice the value derived from the hut spectrum of a face - on shock near the center of the remnant @xcite , and about seven times the value in the x - ray region associated with the face - on shock @xcite .",
    "it is also about 25 times the characteristic pressure of the x - ray emitting gas derived by @xcite , corrected for the revised distance of 250  pc to vela .",
    "the high pressure is consistent with knot d originating in a bullet near the center of the remnant in that the bullets have to have ram pressures substantially larger than the average to punch out through the shell .",
    "the enhanced pressure would not be consistent with the knot being a blister on the surface , such as formed in the model suggested by @xcite for expanding snr shells .",
    "it is interesting that @xcite derived a pressure slightly higher than our value in the region around the line of sight towards hd 72089 , which is also near some arcuate optical filaments .",
    "they also found several high velocity components in the absorption spectrum of the star .",
    "the enhanced pressure suggests that the high velocity emission and optical filaments at the position observed by @xcite may be related to a bullet similar to knot d but traveling towards us .",
    "we have used steady flow shock models to explain the observed emission lines . at the mdrs location , these lines arise in a shell within the surface of an evolving bow shock . @xcite",
    "approximate a herbig - haro bow shock by a series of plane parallel , steady flow oblique shocks ; an approximation that they find valid if the cooling time is short compared to dynamical times .",
    "knot d is about 30  ( @xmath96  cm ) beyond the main blast wave . assuming that it is moving at @xmath97  km  s@xmath5 @xcite , it has taken about 4000  years for it to get to its current position since overtaking the blast wave .",
    "the cooling time for a 150  km  s@xmath5 shock running into 5  @xmath1 material is about 300 years .",
    "the front of the bow shock is running into a denser part of the cloud .",
    "this encounter results in a slower shock that gives rise to the optical filaments as also the low ionization ultraviolet lines .",
    "the use of steady flow models has another limitation : shocks of 180  km  s@xmath5 are subject to thermal instabilities @xcite .",
    "the structure and spectrum of such a shock fluctuate in time @xcite , but the spectrum averaged over time is not greatly affected @xcite .",
    "the spectrograph apertures include emission from sufficiently complex filaments that the fluctuations are probably smoothed out .",
    "we have analyzed far - ultraviolet and optical observations of knot d in the vela snr , and shown that the emission is due to shocks driven into a medium with typical interstellar cloud densities and normal elemental abundances .",
    "we have also found that the dynamical pressure of the shocks is higher than the characteristic value for the remnant .",
    "we have estimated that the path length through the optical filaments is shorter than their extent in the plane of the sky implying a curved shock front .",
    "the velocity profiles of the lines revealed by high resolution fuse mdrs is consistent with emission from a bow shock .",
    "the over - pressure in knot d supports the idea that it is a bow shock around a bullet or cloud that originated near the center of the remnant and has punched through the shell . however , there is no evidence for enhanced abundances .",
    "if the driver of the bow shock is a shrapnel of ejecta @xcite , then it remains undetected .",
    "an alternative candidate for the driver is an accelerated cloud that originated near the center .",
    "the existence of such clouds was suggested by @xcite to explain some of the high velocity emission observed in snrs .",
    "knot d , in spite of its unique properties , may be one of many such features including the ones observed in the plane of the sky around vela , as well as others moving radially towards or away from us . in any case",
    ", our study provides an estimate of the properties of knot d that can be usefully compared with results derived from x - ray data .",
    "the properties of knot d can also be compared with those of other regions to find out the extent of their similarities .",
    "the suggestion that knot d is associated with rxj0852.0 - 4622 @xcite has been made mainly on morphological grounds .",
    "the connection also depends on the smaller remnant being at about the same distance as the vela snr .",
    "the distance and also the age of rxj0852.0 - 4622 are highly uncertain @xcite and provide very few constraints on the properties of putative blow - out regions .",
    "we have found that the interstellar extinction towards the optical filaments is typical for the vela snr .",
    "furthermore our ultraviolet data do not show any peculiarities ( e.g.  in the velocity distribution ) that suggest a connection between the knot and the newly discovered remnant .",
    "therefore , we believe that knot d is associated with the vela snr .",
    "it will require additional studies to prove or disprove conclusively the association between rxj0852.0 - 4622 and knot d.    one major issue that remains unanswered is the gap of about 1between the optical filaments and the edge of the x - ray knot ( figure  [ f_image ] ) .",
    "this is not seen in typical shock - cloud interactions ( see references in  3.1 ) where the x - ray edge and optical emission are co - incident . in those cases , the relationship of the two components is well explained by a model in which the blast wave hits the cloud and a reverse shock is propagated back into the remnant @xcite . in knot d , the gap must be a consequence of the dynamics of the bow shock .",
    "the gap region could contain gas that is hot but with a temperature not high enough to make x - rays .",
    "the region may then be a source of bright o  vi emission .",
    "it could also be a transient region of low pressure as predicted by models of thermal instability @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is that it is a region of cool gas supported by magnetic pressure .",
    "each of these possibilities has interesting implications for the structure and evolution of astrophysical bow shocks , but the existing data do not allow us to distinguish among them . however , it is worth noting that the spatial extent of the gap may be related to the cooling length of the shocked gas . at the distance of vela ,",
    "1  is about @xmath98  cm , which is roughly the cooling length scale of a 240  km  s@xmath5 shock in a medium with density 3  @xmath1 .",
    "these conditions may have obtained in the course of the evolution of the bow shock .",
    "detailed models and direct observations are needed for further elucidation .",
