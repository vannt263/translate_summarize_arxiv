    "in qcd , the three fundamental splittings of the two types of colour charged fields participating in the strong interaction ( quarks  ( @xmath0 ) and gluons  ( @xmath1 ) ) are @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding _ splitting kernels _ , which describe both the kinematics and the relative strengths of these splittings , are proportional to the _ colour factors _",
    "@xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively , where @xmath7 is the number of active quark flavours in @xmath4 decays .",
    "the values for these colour factors originate directly from the group @xmath8(3 ) underlying qcd so that precise measurements of these couplings validate qcd as the fundamental theory for strong interactions . in the sensible range of @xmath9 , the ratio of the splitting kernels",
    "@xmath10 is nearly constant ( 2.0 - 2.3 ) and exactly = 2.25 in limit of large energy transfers .",
    "this leads to the expectation of a  times higher probability of gluon bremsstrahlung in gluon jets with respect to quark jets .",
    "this ratio should be visible for observables which are proportional to the splitting probabilities of gluons and quarks@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , quarks and gluons are no free particles .",
    "therefore one has to use jets of gluons and quarks in three jet events as the best approximation of the tree level graphs . beyond the necessity to rely on the assumption of lphd ( * l*ocal * h*adron * p*arton * d*uality ) which states that the parton properties are preserved to the hadron level which",
    "is then clustered to jets , this approach is further limited by the influence of interference effects in the event . moreover the assignment of particles to jets is somewhat arbitrarily .",
    "further , the jet finding algorithms introduce ambiguities when assigning particles to jets .",
    "6 cm    gluon jets were originally identified in symmetric three jet events ( _ y events_)@xcite . in these events",
    "the most energetic jet is excluded from the analysis , as the rate of gluon induced leading jets is rather low . due to the symmetric event topology ( @xmath11 ,",
    "see  fig .  1 )",
    ", the low energy jets are expected to be directly comparable . by identifying one of these jets as a @xmath12-quark jet using impact parameter techniques , the remaining jet is identified indirectly as a gluon jet . the properties of a comparable @xmath13-quark jet sample can then be obtained from non-@xmath12 events , where the gluon properties are eliminated from by subtraction techniques  @xcite .",
    "recently this technique has also been extended to non - symmetric events@xcite ( see  fig .  1 ) . in this case one",
    "relies on the quark / gluon composition of jets as predicted by the three jet matrix elements taken from monte carlo simulations .",
    "this technique improves the available statistic and gives access to a wider range of energy scales , but requires a criterion for the selection of comparable gluon and quark jets .",
    "these jets are obtained from events with different topologies .",
    "the comparison of jet properties obtained for this event sample and for y events helps in finding a suitable scale to classify the jets with .",
    "one yields about 20,000 identified gluons in y events and about 100,000 in the asymmetric events .",
    "the relevant scale for the jet evolution is not just the jet energy . in  ,",
    "the fragmentation functions of quark jets as a function of their energy are shown .",
    "the _ rows _ in this figure correspond to data taken in the same @xmath14 intervals .",
    "the much more pronounced scaling violation pattern of jets obtained from symmetric events ( @xmath15 ) compared to jets from asymmetric events clearly disfavours the jet energy as the relevant scale .",
    "0.480.46    soft radiation is limited to cones given by the opening angles between the jets .",
    "this motivates transverse momentum scales .",
    "the _ hardness _",
    "@xmath16 is a better choice@xcite , as it accounts for the limited phase space available for gluon radiation due to the interference of radiated gluons in the event event .",
    "often also the definition @xmath17 is used . ] . shows the good agreement of light quark jets in three jet events with jets in annihilations from petra energies@xcite to the highest lep energies@xcite in normalization and slopes using @xmath18 for the first and @xmath19 for the latter .",
    "this agreement confirms the interpretation of @xmath18 as a valid scale for jet evolution in three jet events . in multi - jet events",
    "several scales may be relevant ; in so far the usage of @xmath18 as a ( single ) scale is an approximation .",
    "another possible choice is the scale @xmath20 , introduced in  .",
    "recently , several properties of quark and gluon jets which can be expected to be sensitive to , such as the scaling violation of quark and gluon jets@xcite and the scale dependence of the quark and gluon jet multiplicities@xcite have been analysed using data collected with the delphi  detector at lep .",
    "the gluon and quark fragmentation functions @xmath21 are measured in dependence of different values of @xmath18 at a fixed cms energy ( see   for a short discussion of jet scales ) .",
    "0.480.46    the predictions are derived from the numerical solution of the dglap evolution equation in first order  @xcite .",
    "the following ansatz has been used to parameterize the fragmentation function at a fixed scale @xmath22 to start the evolution : @xmath23 the parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the colour factor @xmath26 are fitted simultaneously .    the softening of the fragmentation functions with increasing @xmath27 is observed .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for gluon jets than for quark jets .",
    "[ f : xech ] compares the gluon and the quark fragmentation function at a fixed topology .      shows the measurement for light quark jets in three jet events as a function of @xmath18 , represented by the open symbols and superimposed by power law fits . the corresponding result for gluons",
    "is shown in   for symmetric and asymmetric event topologies .",
    "the good agreement between the two event samples in   demonstrates that @xmath18 is a sensible choice for the scale of gluon jets as well .",
    "a simultaneous fit with the first order dglap equations to both the quark and gluon fragmentation functions has been performed . beyond the parameters of the analytic ansatz of the fragmentation functions , @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "have been treated as free parameters .",
    "the fit is sensitive to the occurrence of @xmath26 in the @xmath3 splitting kernel .",
    "the fit describes the data well and yields :    0.480.46    @xmath28 for the colour factor ratio .    in the logarithmic slope of the gluon and quark fragmentation functions",
    "are compared in dependence of @xmath14 superimposed by the result of the dglap fits .",
    "the shaded area indicates the statistical uncertainty of @xmath26 .",
    "the data points were obtained from power law fits to each @xmath14 interval individually . as expected from the structure of the dglap equation ,",
    "the scaling violations are @xmath29 2 times larger for gluons than for quarks .",
    "furthermore , the observed scaling violation in quark jets is in very good agreement with the measurements of the tasso collaboration@xcite ( already visible in  ) .",
    "there is a long standing qcd prediction that in the limit of large parton ( or jet ) energies the ratio @xmath30 of the gluon over the quark multiplicity should be equal to @xcite . following a nnlo calculation@xcite , @xmath31 is reduced by @xmath32 and nearly independent of energy .",
    "shows the scale dependence of the jet multiplicity and shows this ratio as a function of the hardness @xmath18 .",
    "obviously , the ratio is much lower than expected ; consequently neither the lo nor the nnlo prediction for @xmath31 can describe the measured data .    to describe the quark and gluon jet multiplicities , one would set @xmath33 as calculated from some qcd approach@xcite and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "a modification of this ansatz had to be performed to obtain a sensible description of the measured data : @xmath36 the introduction of the phenomenological offsets @xmath37 and @xmath38 which are assumed to be constant , accounts for expected differences of the fragmentation of the leading quark or gluon .",
    "0.480.46    the quality of the fit increases from @xmath39=14.5 to 0.85 when introducing these additional terms .",
    "the difference @xmath37-@xmath38 yields about 2 , consistent with about one additional _ instable _ primary particle built in the primary quark fragmentation . unlike the multiplicity ratio itself",
    ", the ratio of derivatives of the gluon and quark multiplicities with scale @xmath40 is in the predicted range of @xmath41 already at very small scale values ( see  ) .",
    "this corresponds to the expectation that if the multiplicity ratio is  in the limit of very large energies , the ratio of the slopes shows the same behaviour , simply due to de lhpital s rule .",
    "there should be less sensitivity of the slope ratio to non - perturbative effects than of the multiplicity ratio itself .",
    "furthermore , the fit to the quark and gluon jet multiplicities extrapolates very well to the multiplicity ratios measured by cleo ( direct measurement of @xmath42 decays)@xcite and opal ( analysis of most energetic jets)@xcite , which is a confirmation of this analysis .    fitting  and  [ eq : ng ] to the data yields @xmath43 , in agreement with qcd . nevertheless , large systematic errors are here to be expected for this value due to ambiguities in the assignment of particles to jets , the definition of the three jet region and the choice of the underlying jet scale",
    ".      the uncertainties in the determination of the colour factor ratio quoted in can be avoided by applying a mlla prediction@xcite for three jet event  multiplicities , @xmath44 , to the data : @xmath45 the first term represents the multiplicity of an  event at a cms energy of the invariant mass of the @xmath46 system , the second term half the multiplicity of a hypothetical @xmath47 event with a cms energy of twice the transverse momentum of the gluon .",
    "coherence effects are included by the exact definition of the scales .",
    "again , the term `` -@xmath48 '' was introduced into the original mlla prediction to absorb non - perturbative contributions .    10",
    "cm    has been applied to strictly symmetric events with .",
    "therefore the only parameter describing the event topology is the opening angle @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 has been chosen as @xmath51@xcite ( as in  ) ; the free parameters of these formulae are obtained from the multiplicities of events as a function of the cms energy .",
    "8 shows the three jet event  multiplicities as a function of the opening angle @xmath49 . superimposed is the fit with  and @xmath48 as free parameters as a solid line , extrapolated to the region contaminated by two jet events ( @xmath52 ) , which is excluded from the fit .",
    "the dashed line represents the original prediction ( = 2.25 , and @xmath53 ) .",
    "the need for some kind of correction to account for non - perturbative effects is obvious , and the ansatz of adding a constant term is a simple but effective choice .",
    "the fit yields a very precise accurate measurement of  : @xmath54    the prediction of the multiplicity ratio given in @xcite has been tried as an alternative to the given @xmath55 .",
    "although this calculation takes recoil effects into account , a non - perturbative offset term is still required .",
    "the prediction differs by about 10% from @xcite in the nnlo term .",
    "as it does not reproduce the colour factor ratio contained in the fragmentation models which describe the data well , it has not been applied in this analysis .",
    "shows the obtained result for the colour factor ratio in comparison of those obtained from four jet analyses .",
    "as far as we know our result is the most accurate measurement of @xmath56 so far .    in order to illustrate comprehensively the contents of the measurement of the three jet multiplicity we compare in fig .",
    "[ qq_gg_mult ] the multiplicity corresponding to a @xmath57 and a  final state .",
    "the  multiplicity is taken to be the multiplicity measured in  annihilation corrected for the @xmath58 contribution .",
    "the @xmath57 multiplicity at low scale values is taken from the cleo measurement @xcite , for which no systematic error was specified . at higher scale ,",
    "twice the difference of the three jet multiplicity and the  term ( the first term in eqn .  [ eqn:3mul_0 ] ) is interpreted as the @xmath57 multiplicity .",
    "the dashed curve through the  points is a fit of @xmath59 .",
    "the @xmath57 line is the perturbative expectation for back - to - back gluons according to the second term of eqn .",
    "[ eqn:3mul_0 ] .",
    "the plot shows again that the increase of the @xmath57 multiplicity with scale is about twice as big as in the  case , illustrating the large gluon - to - quark colour factor ratio .",
