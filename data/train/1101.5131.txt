    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms forming a hexagonal lattice , has remarkable properties  @xcite . in the tight - binding approximation",
    "the quadratic hamiltonian gives origin to a dispersion formula which for low momenta is analogous to the dispersion formula for relativistic fermions in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this has prompted some researchers to adapt to graphene lattice gauge theory techniques which have been profitably used for the study of quantum chromodynamics and other particle systems  @xcite . in the work of  @xcite one",
    "approximates first the tight - binding hamiltonian of graphene with a dirac hamiltonian , incorporates the coulomb interaction through the introduction of a suitable electromagnetic field , and finally discretizes the resulting continuum quantum field theory on a hypercubic space - time lattice .",
    "the hybrid monte carlo method  @xcite , widely used in lattice gauge theory to simulate fermions interacting with quantum gauge fields , can then be used to investigate the effects of the coulomb interaction in the graphene system .",
    "the approach outlined above has led to very interesting and valuable results  @xcite , yet one would think that , since the starting point is a system already defined on a lattice , it should be possible to apply the hybrid monte carlo technique directly to the graphene lattice . the clear advantage of this approach is the direct connection to the experimentally determined physical lattice constants of the tight - binding model , which represents an accurate description of the experimental system . in this letter",
    "we illustrate how this can be done .",
    "graphene is a system of interacting electrons located at the vertices of a hexagonal lattice .",
    "it is convenient to think of the graphene lattice as consisting of two triangular sublattices , which we denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which together with the centers of the hexagons ( sublattice @xmath2 ) form a finer , underlying triangular lattice ( fig .",
    "[ sublattices ] ) .",
    "we introduce fermionic annihilation and creation operators @xmath3 for the electrons on the two sublattices , where @xmath4 is a site index and @xmath5 is the spin index .",
    "the lattice must be made finite in order to perform numerical simulations . while there is a broad range of boundary conditions of physical interest ,",
    "here we consider periodic systems formed by identifying opposing sides of a hexagonal lattice of length @xmath6 , illustrated in fig .",

    "we have explicitly introduced the charge coupling constant @xmath14 .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first note that in the kinetic term we have neglected the smaller next - to - nearest neighbor hopping within each sublattice , which would introduce a small ( probably manageable ) complex phase in the path integral .",
    "the charge operator eq .",
    "[ eq4 ] has a @xmath15 to account for the background charge of the carbon ion : it ensures that the system is neutral at half filling , and it will play an important role for our functional integral formulation .",
    "@xmath13 could be the actual 3d coulomb potential , but could be any other interaction potential .",
    "the only thing crucial for us is that the matrix @xmath16 be positive definite .",
    "finally , we note that the hamiltonian of eqs .",

    "our goal is to provide an equivalent path integral formulation of eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] conducive to calculation by numerical simulation , following a rather standard procedure to convert from the hamiltonian into a lagrangian .",
    "we will first express the expectation values and the partition function in terms of an integral over anticommuting fermionic fields , i.e.  elements of a grassmann algebra .",
    "( the literature on the path integral formulation of quantum expectation values is very rich . in our work",
    "we followed the very clear and useful formulation given in the first chapters of  @xcite . )",
    "this gives origin to an integrand with an exponential containing a quadratic form in the fermionic fields , from @xmath23 and the normal ordering of @xmath24 , as well as a quartic expression , from @xmath24 .",
    "the quartic expression can be reduced to a quadratic form by a hubbard - stratonovich transformation  @xcite , through the introduction of a suitable auxiliary bosonic field ( in our case a real field ) , and now the gaussian integral over the elements of the fermionic variables can be explicitly performed , leaving an integral over the bosonic field only .",
    "the problem , however , is to obtain an integral that can be interpreted as an integration over a well defined probabilistic measure , which can thus be approximated by stochastic simulation techniques .",
    "we will show here how the symmetries of the system make this possible .",
    "we start by rewriting the expression for the charge as @xmath25 we now introduce hole creation and annihilation operators for the electrons with spin @xmath15 : @xmath26 so that the charge becomes @xmath27 note that we dropped the spin indices since from now on @xmath28 and @xmath29 will always refer to spin 1 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "finally we change the sign of the @xmath29 operators on one of the sublattices .",
    "the crucial constraint is that all redefinitions of the operators respect the anticommutator algebra .",
    "from the fact that @xmath23 only couples sites on the two different sublattices , it follows that @xmath23 now takes the form @xmath30    we introduce fermionic coherent states @xmath31 where @xmath32 are anticommuting fermionic variables ( elements of a grassmann algebra ) .    the path integral formulation",
    "is obtained by factoring @xmath33 with @xmath34 , and then inserting repeatedly among the factors the resolution of the identity expressed in terms of an integral over the fermionic variables .",
    "the trace in eq .",
    "[ eq5 ] must also be expressed in terms of a similar integral .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite for details . )",
    "this leads to integrals over fermionic fields @xmath35 ( the index @xmath36 appears because of the multiple resolutions of the identity and can be thought of as an index labeling euclidean time ) , which contain in the integrand expressions of the type @xmath37 the last ingredient is the identity @xmath38 which is true of any normal ordered function @xmath39 of the operators @xmath40 .",
    "the hamiltonian is in fact already in normal order except for the local term @xmath41 , which can be written as the sum of two normal - ordered pieces , @xmath42 by reassigning the quadratic term in eq .",
    "[ eqnormal ] to @xmath23 , the exponent @xmath43 in eq .",
    "[ eq12 ] is normal ordered but the exponential @xmath44 is not .",
    "however @xmath44 differs from its normal ordered form @xmath45 by terms @xmath46 .",
    "so , in the limit of @xmath47 one may replace the operator expression @xmath44 with an exponential involving the fermionic fields , as follows from eq .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the partition function @xmath48 where @xmath49 and we have used @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) as a shorthand for the indices @xmath52 .",

    "the down spins are treated as antiparticles ( holes ) moving backward in time relative to the up spins , exactly canceling the phase for each separately .",

    "equation  [ eq20 ] is the main result of our work .",
    "it establishes the partition function and expectation values as integrals over real variables with a positive definite measure .",
    "this is a crucial step for the application of stochastic approximation methods .",
    "there remains the problem of sampling the field @xmath57 with a measure which contains the determinant of a large matrix .",

    "the phase space of these variables is explored by first extracting the @xmath70 , @xmath74 and @xmath73 according to their gaussian measure , and then evolving the @xmath75 and @xmath70 variables with fixed @xmath76 according to the evolution determined by the hamiltonian @xmath77 because of liouville s theorem , the combined motion through phase space will produce an ensemble of variables distributed according to the measure in eq .",
