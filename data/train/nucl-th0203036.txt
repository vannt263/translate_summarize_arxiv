    ", substantial attraction is gained due to several additional bound subsystems such as for the @xmath45he - @xmath2 and the @xmath190he - @xmath190he clusters which almost saturate the corresponding rearrangement channels ( @xmath83 ) - @xmath2 and ( @xmath191 ) - ( @xmath191 ) , respectively .",

    "[ fig : e6e5 ] .",
    "judging by the slope of the straight lines prevailing over most of the interval shown in the figure , the @xmath4 interaction is more effective in binding @xmath45he than binding either one of the @xmath193 @xmath4 hypernuclei .",
    "for this range of mass values , the heavier the nuclear core is  the larger @xmath181 is ( except for a vanishingly weak @xmath170 where the trend is opposite ) , implying that no saturation is yet reached . within such three - body models",
    "@xmath181 appears to get saturated already about @xmath203 , judging by the slope of the three - body calculation straight line of fig .",
    "[ fig : e6e10f ] .",
    "however , the special four - body cluster structure of @xmath151be reverses this trend of saturation , apparently delaying it into somewhat heavier species ( for considerably heavier nuclear cores @xmath181 should start occasionally decreasing slowly to zero with @xmath79 ) .    we have already compared our calculations , discussing tables [ tab : tabl3],[tab : lla],[tab : llaa ] , with those of ref .",

    "is the first one of its kind .",
    "we estimate an error of about 0.5 mev due to limiting the @xmath197be calculation to @xmath5 waves .",
    "our calculation yields more binding for @xmath151be than that produced by most of the previous calculations , wherever comparison is meaningful . in particular , a fairly large value of @xmath205 mev survives in the limit @xmath175 owing to the @xmath138 structure of the @xmath206be core .",
    "our calculation confirms , if not aggravates , the incompatibility of the ` old ' experimental determination of the binding energy of @xmath45he @xcite with that of @xmath197be @xcite in accordance with previous cluster calculations , irrespective of whether or not three - body @xmath85 interactions are included ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite respectively ) .",
    "the ` new ' experimental determination of the binding energy of @xmath196he @xcite is found to be even more incompatible with that of @xmath197be .",
    "assuming that the determination of @xmath207 was plagued by an unobserved @xmath111 deexcitation involving either @xmath197be@xmath208 or @xmath84be@xmath208 , somewhere along the sequence of tracks observed in the emulsion event carefully reanalyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite , does not satisfactorily resolve this incompatibility .",
    "adding @xmath209b @xcite as input does not alleviate it either , since the possibility of unobserved @xmath111 deexcitation can not be dismissed also for this species , while on the theoretical side the analysis of @xmath209b in terms of a few - cluster system is more dubious than for the lighter @xmath4 species .",
    "our conclusion differs radically from the recent claim of compatibility by albertus _",
    "@xcite who used a different methodology , largely untested in studies of very light nuclear species .    discarding the past history of emulsion experimentation for @xmath210 hypernuclear events identified as heavier than @xmath196he , because of",
    "the ambiguities mentioned here , one remains with the very recent report from the kek e373 experiment @xcite which claims to have identified uniquely @xmath196he , with @xmath211 mev .",
    "no particle - stable excited states are possible for this species or for its @xmath3 hypernuclear core @xmath190he , so this event - if confirmed by adding more events of its kind - should be taken as the most directly relevant constraint on the @xmath210 interaction .",
    "moreover , @xmath196he is ideally suited for three - body cluster calculations such as the faddeev equations here solved for the @xmath29 system . using @xmath5-wave soft - core @xmath210 potentials that simulate several of the nijmegen @xmath210 interaction models",
    ", we have shown that such simulations of model nsc97 , versions @xmath212 and @xmath213 of which have been shown recently to agree quantitatively with data on light @xmath3 hypernuclei @xcite , are capable of nearly reproducing the new value @xcite of @xmath214he ) , short by about 0.5 mev of the mean value .",
    "needs to be increased from its values listed in table [ tab : tabl1 ] for model nsc97 to 0.6598 , yielding the following low - energy parameters : @xmath215 fm , @xmath216 fm .",
    "] in fact , we estimate the theoretical uncertainty of our faddeev calculation for @xmath196he as a fraction of 0.5 mev .",
    "two approximations give rise to this theoretical uncertainty , one is the restriction to @xmath5-waves in the partial - wave expansion of the faddeev equations , excluding higher @xmath217 values ; the other one is ignoring the off - diagonal @xmath218 interaction which admixes @xmath219 components into the @xmath220he wavefunction .",
    "the following estimates may be given for the errors incurred in these approximations .",
    "as for the @xmath5-wave approximation , the calculations by ikeda _",
    "@xcite give 99.7% probability weight for the ( @xmath147)=(0,0 ) channel , with higher partial waves adding only 0.3 mev binding energy , well within the error bars of the measured energies .",
    "as for including explicitly the @xmath218 coupling , a recent work by yamada and nakamoto @xcite using model nd(g ) ( another model ) finds an increase of 0.4 ( 0.1 ) mev in the calculated @xmath221he ) value due to including explicitly the @xmath218 coupling , resulting in a 0.3% ( 0.1% ) probability @xmath219 component .",
    "_ @xcite found a similar increase of 0.2 mev due to explicitly including this coupling , for a @xmath4 interaction comparable to those used in the present work .",
    "however , these authors pointed out that , with respect to a calculation using an _ effective _ single - channel @xmath4 interaction which implicitly includes the effect of @xmath218 coupling in free space , an explicit two - channel calculation for @xmath45he yields a reduction of @xmath221he ) by about 0.3 mev .",
    "this reduction is expected due to the tight binding of the @xmath2 cluster which inhibits the effectiveness of the @xmath218 coupling .",
    "therefore , the effects of the two approximations here discussed tend to cancel each other almost completely .",
    "this conclusion should also hold qualitatively for @xmath151be due to the fairly large energy which the @xmath218 coupling requires in order to break an @xmath2 constituent .    if model nsc97 , as our few - body calculations suggest , provides for the right su(3 ) extrapolation from fits to @xmath14 and @xmath17 data ,",
    "then it is questionable whether @xmath222h is particle stable .",
    "the subtlties involved in estimating whether or not this species provides for the onset of @xmath210 binding in nuclei were clearly demonstrated in ref .",
    "its @xmath223 , at any rate , should not exceed 0.5 mev for considerably stronger @xmath4 interactions @xcite . if the ags e906 events conjectured in ref . @xcite as evidence for @xmath222h are confirmed as such in a future extension of this experiment , this four - body system @xmath224 would play as a fundamental role for studying theoretically the hyperon - hyperon forces as @xmath152h @xmath225 has played for studying theoretically the hyperon - nucleon forces @xcite .",
    "our preliminary results , studying the solutions of the faddeev - yakubovsky equations for the @xmath224 system , indicate that @xmath222h is unstable against @xmath3 emission .",
