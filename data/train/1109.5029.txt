    "low - frequency ( in comparison with the ion gyrofrequency ) electrostatic drift waves in a nonuniform collisionless magnetized electron - ion plasma are supported by inertialess electrons and inertial ions @xcite . in the pseudo - three dimensional drift wave electric field @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wave potential , the electrons have a helical trajectory due to their @xmath2 and @xmath3 drift motions in a plane perpendicular to the external magnetic field @xmath4 , as well as their rapid motion along the external magnetic field direction , where @xmath5 is the unit vector along the @xmath6 axis in a cartesian coordinate system , @xmath7 the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath8 the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath9 the boltzmann constant , @xmath10 the magnitude of the electron charge , @xmath11 the electron temperature , and @xmath12 the electron number density .",
    "furthermore , the motion of the two - dimensional ions in a plane perpendicular to the axial direction is governed by the @xmath13 and the polarization @xmath14 drifts , where we have denoted @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the ion gyrofrequency , and @xmath17 the ion mass .    hence , the electron and ion density fluctuations are different due to the differential electron and ion motions in a magnetized plasma with an equilibrium density gradient .",
    "the resulting space charge separation , in turn , causes dispersive drift oscillations to propagate across the homogenous magnetic field and density gradient directions .    in a collisional electron - ion magnetoplasma",
    ", dispersive drift waves are excited by the combined action of the density inhomogeneity and electron - ion collisions .",
    "the latter produce a phase lag between the magnetic field - aligned electron velocity perturbation as well as the drift wave potential and the electron density perturbation . as a result ,",
    "drift waves grow exponentially , extracting energy from the equilibrium density gradient .",
    "it is understood that nonthermal drift waves cause anomalous cross - field diffusion of the plasma particles @xcite .",
    "the plasma particle confinement is significantly improved if there are cylindrically symmetric zonal / sheared flows @xcite that are nonlinearly excited by finite amplitude dispersive drift waves in plasmas .",
    "thus , zonal flows act like a transport barrier @xcite .",

    "this leads to a flute - like shukla - varma ( sv ) mode @xcite in a nonuniform dusty magnetoplasma .",

    "the work presented in refs .  @xcite ( and others for similar topics ) has shown that a dynamically variable dust charge can have a profound effect on linear drift wave stability . in a comprehensive dusty plasma turbulence model",
    "the charging process should therefore be taken into account .",
    "we have here refrained from including the charging process in order not to multiply the number of free parameters beyond the absolute necessary .",
    "the effect of dust charging dynamics on ( nonlinear fully developed ) drift wave turbulence has ( to our knowledge ) not yet been addressed in the literature .",
    "while we recognize that this would indeed be a worthwile effort , it is another kind of study itself    an important point why we have so far refrained from performing this study ourselves is the many uncertainties related to the dust grain charging model for a nonuniform , collisional magnetoplasma that have been used so far . in particular , the dust grain charging is a dyanmical process and requires a complete kinetic theory for fluctuating ( in the electrostatic field of pseudo - three - dimensional drift waves ) electron and ion currents that reach the surface of dust grains in our plasma .    in the following , we study turbulence properties of the modified ( by the presence of charged dust particles ) drift waves in a nonuniform collisional magnetoplasma with static charged dust impurities .",
    "thus , we are assuming that the timescales for the excitation of drift waves and their evolution are much shorter than the dust plasma and dust gyroperiods , and much longer than the electron - ion relaxation period .",
    "furthermore , the assumption of constant dust charge would remain valid since the dust grain charging frequency is typically much larger than the modified drift wave frequency .",
