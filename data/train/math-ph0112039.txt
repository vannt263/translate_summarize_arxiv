    "although the most recent cosmological observations suggest we live in a flat universe , the possibility that such observations are indicating a non - flat space with almost vanishing curvature can not yet be excluded , since it is not easy to distinguish a truly flat universe , where the curvature is null , from a negatively or positively curved universe inflated until the point of having almost no curvature .",
    "such indeterminacy , somewhat fundamental , is linked to another one about the compactness or not of the universe , _ i.e. _ , of its topology , and in any case one can ask if it would be possible , in principle , to achieve a higher degree of certainty .    the line of research confronting such problem can be summarized by the question `` can one see the shape of the universe ? ''",
    "@xcite , which is related to the problem of `` hearing the shape of a drum '' @xcite . unfortunately , the answers obtained until now from the cosmological observations are unconclusive or , at most , not much restrictive .",
    "more complete studies would , for example , involve as a first step the solution of the eigenvalue problem of the laplace - beltrami operator , _",
    "i.e. _ , the helmholtz equation , in several spaces of different curvatures , compact and not compact , and this is yet an open field of research @xcite .    for flat , euclidean geometry , it is easy to find in textbooks all the systems of coordinates where the helmholtz equation is solvable : 4 systems for the 2-dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 and 11 systems for the 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , one can see that almost all physically motivated studies of hyperbolic spaces present in literature use only the analogous of the spherical polar coordinates of flat geometry , probably because such coordinate system is obtained as a trivial generalization for hyperbolic geometry , and also probably because this system of coordinates is the one one would expect to use , for instance , in cosmological observations .    however , in the same way as in flat geometry , there are also other groups of coordinates in hyperbolic geometry which can be adequate for several specific problems , or where the helmholtz equation can be solved .",
    "one recent example found in literature is the use of a set of hyperbolic coordinates analogous to the euclidean cylindrical ones to solve a problem of quantum cosmology @xcite .    with no other purpose than serving as one more tool for works involving 2 and 3-dimensional hyperbolic spaces , and with no intention of being complete",
    ", this paper simply presents a description of several sets of coordinates for these spaces , showing in the majority of cases the general solutions of helmholtz equation for the sets presented  4 sets for the 2-dimensional space @xmath3 and 12 for the 3-dimensional space @xmath4 , numbers which probably do not cover all possibilities for the spaces @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ pro ] describes two types of projections that can be used for visualizing the hyperbolic space ; sections [ 2d ] and [ 3d ] present , respectively , different coordinate systems for 2 and 3-dimensional hyperbolic spaces ; and section [ end ] is a brief conclusion .",
    "the infinite hyperbolic space @xmath5 can be described by the @xmath6-dimensional surface described by the constraint @xmath7 where the last equality shows explicitly that @xmath8diag@xmath9 $ ] is the metric of a minkovski space of dimension @xmath10 , also represented by the element of line @xmath11 notice that equation ( [ vinculo ] ) is in perfect analogy with the constraint equation for a spherical surface , @xmath12 , where the metric used is the euclidean one .    in order to better visualize the infinite hyperbolic surface one can use several types of geometric projections , in almost the same way",
    "one does to visualize the spherical surface of the earth in one flat sheet of paper .",
    "two kinds of projections , known as klein and poincar projections , are such that the entire @xmath6-dimensional hyperbolic space is ` confined ' into a circular unitary ` ball ' of dimension @xmath6 .",
    "the coordinates for these projections are defined , respectively , as @xmath13 and @xmath14 where @xmath15 . in the klein projection",
    "the geodesics of the hyperbolic space  which are hyperbolas  appear as straight lines , while in the poincar projection they appear as arcs of circles _ or _ straight lines .",
    "an artistic example of the use of these projections can be seen in some works of the dutch painter m.c .",
    "escher , who used them to present fillings of the entire infinite hyperbolic plane @xmath3 with repetitive patterns , a procedure analogous to the covering of a wall with regular tiles .    in the next section both the klein and poincar projections for a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space will be used to show for each system of coordinates a representation of the curves produced when one of the coordinates is kept constant .",
    "as said in the previous section , the 2-dimensional hyperbolic space can be seen as formed by all points that satisfy the constraint @xmath16 notice that the ` central point ' @xmath17 obeys this constraint .",
    "notice also that any change of coordinates that keeps this equation still valid are allowed , producing then parametric equations which will define a coordinate system .",
    "in fact , any coordinate transformation that keeps equation ( [ vinculo2 ] ) invariant is a representation of the internal symmetries of hyperbolic space @xmath3 .",
    "one such symmetry is represented by lorentz boosts in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 directions , and other is given by rotations in the plane @xmath20 .",
    "this symmetries are represented by the matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 which represent , respectively , a rotation of angle @xmath23 in the plane and a boost of rapidity @xmath24 in the direction given by the angle @xmath23 .",
    "one way of combining all these informations at once is to apply , in sequence , two different orthogonal boosts and a rotation to the point @xmath25 , obtaining then a general point @xmath26 , @xmath27 if @xmath28 or @xmath29 this equation gives the polar parametrization of the space @xmath3 , @xmath30 the element of line obtained for these coordinates is , where @xmath31 is the angle known as gudermannian or hyperbolic amplitude @xcite , to obtain the element of line @xmath32 , an equality which shows that these coordinates produce a metric conformal to the one of the sphere . ]",
    "@xmath33    putting @xmath34 in ( [ parametrizacoes ] ) one obtains another parametrization , @xmath35 with the element of line , where @xmath31 is again the gudermannian , gives the element of line @xmath36 . ]",
