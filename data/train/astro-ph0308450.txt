    "the orbital evolution of interplanetary dust particles originating from the trans - neptunian belt [ 1]-[5 ] , halley- and encke - type comets [ 6],[7 ] , and asteroid families and short - period comets [ 8]-[10 ] has been numerically simulated by several authors in order to understand the distribution of dust in the solar system .",
    "observationally , the infrared satellites iras and cobe detected thermal emission from dust outside the earth s orbit [ 11]-[13 ] while pioneers 10 and 11 measured the interplanetary dust population directly using impact detectors [ 14 ] .",
    "the main contribution to the zodiacal light is from particles with diameters of about 20 to 200 @xmath2 m .",
    "it has been estimated that 20,000 to 40,000 tons of micrometer- to millimeter - sized dust particles fall to the earth every year with the mass distribution of dust particles peaking at about 200 @xmath2 m in diameter [ 15 ] .",
    "liou et al . [ 7 ] showed that the observed shape of the zodiacal cloud can be accounted for by a combination of about 1/4 to 1/3 asteroidal dust and about 3/4 to 2/3 cometary dust .",
    "the hypothesis that the kuiperoidal dust ( i.e. , the dust formed in the edgeworth - kuiper belt ) is dominant in the outer solar system explains the pioneer and voyager data fairly well , while fitting a sample of the cobe / dirbe data indicates that the kuiperoidal dust contributes as much as 1/3 of the total number density near the earth ( for a review , see [ 4 ] ) .",
    "ozernoy [ 4 ] considered 1 m and 5 m particles while constructing the brightness of a disk of asteroidal , cometary , and kuiperoidal dust particles which fit the cobe / dirbe data .",
    "analysis of the pioneer 10 and 11 meteoroid detector data [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] showed that a population of @xmath3 and @xmath4 g ( @xmath510 @xmath2 m ) particles has a constant spatial density between 3 and 18 au .",
    "dust grains released by halley - type comets can not account for this observed distribution [ 6 ] , but trans - neptunian dust particles can [ 2 ] . using trans - neptunian dust particles , moro - martin and malhotra [ 5 , fig .",
    "13 ] found that the surface ( not spatial ) density was approximately constant in this region .",
    "liou et al .",
    "[ 1 ] noted that interstellar dust particles with an average size of 1.2 @xmath2 m can destroy dust particles formed in the solar system and that the collisional lifetimes for 1 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 23 @xmath2 m particles are 104 , 49 , 19 , 4.8 , 0.86 myr , respectively . in these",
    "size ranges mutual collisions are not as important as collisions with interstellar grains .",
    "moro - martin and malhotra [ 5 ] concluded that collisional destruction is most important for kuiperoidal grains between 6 @xmath2 m ( 9 @xmath2 m in liou et al . ) and 50 @xmath2 m .",
    "particles larger than 50 @xmath2 m may survive because interstellar grains are too small to destroy them in a single impact . for silicate particles 1 - 40 @xmath2 m in diameter , the sublimation temperature ( @xmath51500 k ) is reached at @xmath6@xmath70.5 au , but for water ice particles the sublimation temperature ( @xmath5100 k ) is reached at 27 , 19 , 14 , 10 , and 4.3 au for the sizes of 3 , 6 , 11 , 23 , and 120 @xmath2 m , respectively [ 1],[5 ] .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a different set of initial orbits for the dust particles than the aforementioned authors and , for the first time , investigate the collisional probabilities of migrating particles with the planets based on a set of orbital elements during their evolution .",
    "we also present plots of the orbital elements of the migrating particles .",
    "using the bulirsh  stoer method of integration , we investigated the migration of asteroidal dust particles under the influence of planetary gravity ( excluding pluto ) , radiation pressure , poynting  robertson drag , and solar wind drag for values of the ratio between the radiation pressure force and the gravitational force @xmath8 equal to 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.25 , and 0.4 .",
    "burns et al . [",
    "18 ] obtained @xmath8=@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the particle s density in grams per cubic centimeter , @xmath11 is its radius in micrometers , and @xmath12 is the radiation pressure coefficient ( @xmath12 is close to unity for particles larger than 1 @xmath2 m ) . for silicates , the @xmath8 values 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.25 , and 0.4",
    "correspond to particle diameters of about 100 , 40 , 9 , 4 , 1.6 , and 1 microns , respectively .",
    "silicate particles with @xmath8 values of 0.01 and 0.05 have masses of @xmath13 g and @xmath3 g. for water ice , our @xmath8 values correspond to particle diameters of 300 , 120 , 23 , 11 , 6 , and 3 @xmath2 m [ 18 ] .",
    "we assume the ratio of solar wind drag to poynting  robertson drag to be 0.35 [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] .",
    "the relative error per integration step was taken to be less than @xmath4 .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of the asteroidal particles were the same as those of the first numbered main - belt asteroids ( jdt 2452500.5 ) , i.e. , dust particles are assumed to leave the asteroids with zero relative velocity .",
    "we considered @xmath14=500 particles for each @xmath8@xmath10.05 , @xmath14=250 for @xmath8=0.01 , and @xmath14=100 for @xmath8=0.004 .",
    "with @xmath8@xmath10.01 in each run we took @xmath14=250 , because for @xmath14@xmath1500 the computer time per calculation for one particle was several times greater than for @xmath14=250 .",
    "the simulations continued until all of the particles either collided with the sun or reached 2000 au from the sun .",
    "the lifetimes of all considered asteroidal dust particles were less than 0.8 myr , except for one particle with a lifetime of 19 myr .",
    "we also made similar runs without planets to investigate the role of planets in interplanetary dust migration .",
    "in our runs , planets were considered as material points , but using orbital elements obtained with a step @xmath15 of @xmath1620 yr ( @xmath15=10 yr for @xmath8 equal to 0.1 and 0.25 , and @xmath15=20 yr for other values of @xmath8 ) , similar to [ 19 ] we calculated the mean probability @xmath17=@xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the probability for all @xmath14 considered particles ) of a collision of a particle with a planet during the lifetime of the particle .",
    "we define @xmath20=@xmath21 as the mean time during which the perihelion distance @xmath22 of a particle was less than the semi - major axis of the planet and @xmath23 as the mean time spent in jupiter - crossing orbits .",
    "below , @xmath24 is the ratio of the number of particles that collided with the sun to the total number of particles . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the minimum and maximum values of the time until the collision of a particle with the sun , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the minimum and maximum values of the time when the distance between a particle and the sun reached 2000 au .",
    "with @xmath8@xmath10.01 the values of @xmath29=@xmath30 , @xmath20 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are shown in table 1 for @xmath14=250 ( for @xmath8=0.1 we present two runs with 250 different particles ) , and @xmath24 was obtained for all considered particles at a fixed @xmath8 .",
    "the minimum time @xmath25 needed to reach the sun is smaller for smaller particles , but the ratio @xmath31 is much greater and the ratio @xmath32 is smaller for @xmath8@xmath10.25 than for @xmath8@xmath160.1 . for @xmath8=0.05 , 498 particles collided with the sun in less than 0.089 myr , but two particles ( with initial orbits close to those of the asteroids 361 and 499 ) , which reached 2000 au , lived for 0.21 myr and 19.06 myr , respectively .",
    "the latter object s perihelion was near saturn s orbit for a long time . at @xmath8@xmath330.05",
    "the first 250 particles did not migrate outside jupiter s orbit , so @xmath23=0 in table 1 .",

    "the probability of a collision of a migrating dust particle with the earth for @xmath8=0.004 is greater by a factor of 1420 than for @xmath8=0.4 .",
    "these probabilities of collisions are in accordance with cratering records in lunar material and on the panels of the long duration exposure facility , which showed that the mass distribution of dust particles encountering earth peaks at @xmath0=200 @xmath2 m [ 9 ] .",

    "kuiper belt the ratio of the number of particles at @xmath37=@xmath66 dropped usually to 10% of the number at @xmath37=0 at @xmath67=0.1 , but sometimes at @xmath67=0.25 .",
    "@xmath34v@xmath35v@xmath35e@xmath35e@xmath35m@xmath35m@xmath68    table 2 is similar to table 1 , but was obtained for kuiperoidal dust particles .",
    "the fraction @xmath24 of kuiperoidal particles collided with the sun was smaller by a factor of 6 than that of asteroidal particles for the same @xmath8 , but the difference in collision probabilities with earth and venus for asteroidal and kuiperoidal particles was smaller than 6 .",
    "this is due to that the mean eccentricities of particles near these planets ( especially , at @xmath8=0.2 ) were smaller for kuiperoidal particles than those for asteroidal particles .",
    "the trans - neptunian belt is considered to be the main source of jupiter - family comets , which can produce much trans - neptunian dust just inside jupiter s orbit .",
    "some of these comets can reach typical near - earth objects orbits [ 19 ] .",
    "the total mass of comets inside jupiter s orbit is much smaller than the total mass of asteroids , but a comet produces more dust per unit minor body mass than an asteroid .",
    "we also investigated the migration of cometary dust particles for @xmath8 equal to 0.002 , 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 , and 0.4 . for silicate particles such values of @xmath8 correspond to diameters equal to about 200 , 100 , 40 , 9 , 4 , 2 , and 1 microns , respectively .",
    "the initial positions and velocities of the particles were the same as those of comet 2p encke .",
    "we considered particles starting near perihelion ( runs denoted as @xmath69 ) , near aphelion ( @xmath70 ) , and when the comet had orbited for @xmath71 after perihelion passage , where @xmath72 is the period of the comet ( such runs are denoted as @xmath73 ) .",
    "variations in time @xmath74 when perihelion was passed was varied with a step @xmath75 day for series s and with a step 1 day for series l. for each @xmath8 we considered @xmath14=101 particles for `` s '' runs and 150 particles for `` l '' runs .",
    "the results obtained are presented in table 3 .",

    "below , @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the longest lifetime of a particle in series of runs . for some runs at @xmath8@xmath10.2 , all particles starting close to perihelion got hyperbolic orbits just after starting from the comet .",

    "relatively large values of @xmath77 for s runs at @xmath86 and @xmath83 and for l runs at @xmath87 and @xmath83 were due to the particles that reached 2000 au from the sun .",

    "for the same values of @xmath8 , the probability of cometary dust particles colliding with a terrestrial planet was several times smaller than for asteroidal dust particles , mainly due to the greater eccentricities and inclinations of the cometary particles . this difference is greater for larger particles .",
    "the ratio of total times spent by cometary particles in inner - earth , aten , and apollo orbits was about 1.5 : 1 : 2 , but varied from run to run .",
    "we investigated collision probabilities of migrating asteroidal , cometary , and kuiperoidal dust particles with the terrestrial planets during the lifetimes of these particles .",
    "these probabilities were considerably greater for larger asteroidal and cometary particles , which is in accordance with the analysis of microcraters .",
    "the probability of collisions of cometary particles with the earth is smaller than for asteroidal particles , and this difference is greater for larger particles .",
    "almost all asteroidal particles with diameter @xmath0@xmath14 @xmath2 m collided with the sun . in almost all cases , inclinations @xmath40@xmath750@xmath88 , and at @xmath38@xmath4310 au the maximum @xmath40 was less for larger asteroidal particles .",
    "the spatial density of asteroidal particles decreases considerably at @xmath38@xmath433 au , so the fraction of asteroidal particles among other particles beyond jupiter s orbit is small .",
