    "neutron stars ( nss ) are compact objects that have densities several times the normal nuclear density in their cores . due to their internal high - density environment ,",

    "it is hoped that inferring global properties of nss from observations may allow one to select the _",
    "correct _ equation of state ( eos ) among many theoretical possibilities .",
    "however , achieving this goal in practice is non - trivial .",
    "the reason is that it is in general not possible to extract all global properties of a ns simultaneously from observations .",
    "it is thus of great interest to search for empirical relationships , which are in general eos dependent ( e.g. , the mass - radius relation of nss ) , connecting only a few physical quantities of a ns so that one might hope to put constraints on the eos by measuring these quantities . on the other hand , from a fundamental physics point of view , it would even be more interesting if the relationships are insensitive to the ns eos models , since one could then use the relations to test the underlying gravitational theory despite our ignorance of dense nuclear matter @xcite .    in the past decade ,",
    "several empirical relations connecting different physical parameters of nss have been proposed .",
    "@xcite and @xcite discovered relationships relating the scaled moment of inertia @xmath1 and compactness @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the moment of inertia , @xmath4 is the mass , and @xmath5 is the radius . making use of the discovered relation , @xcite suggested that the moment of inertia of star a in the double pulsar system j0737 - 3039 @xcite could be determined to about 10% accuracy .",
    "on the other hand , pulsating nss are expected to be promising sources of gravitational waves .",
    "it is expected that studying the gravitational - wave signals emitted by oscillating nss can yield useful information about the internal structure of the stars .",
    "several universal behaviors of the quadrupolar @xmath0-mode have been established @xcite . in particular , @xcite found a pair of nearly eos - independent relations to connect the frequency and damping rate of the @xmath0-mode to the global properties @xmath4 and @xmath3 of the stars ( see section  [ sec : fmode ] ) .",
    "it has been furthermore shown @xcite that the values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath3 of a ns can be inferred accurately from the @xmath0-mode gravitational wave signals .",

    "but how well do we understand gravity ?",
    "so far the most successful theory of gravity is gr , and it has been well tested in weak - field situations ( for a review see * ? ? ?",

    "while it is generally believed that quantum gravity is needed to resolve these problems , it is still interesting to search for alternative theories of gravity that could avoid the singularity problems within the classical level .    in recent years",
    ", a new theory of gravity called eddington - inspired born - infeld ( eibi ) gravity proposed by @xcite has been gaining attention ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "eibi gravity is appealing because it reduces to gr in vacuum and can avoid the big bang singularity @xcite .",
    "the deviation between eibi gravity and gr becomes significant only at high densities .",
    "the implications of eibi gravity in cosmological @xcite and astrophysical @xcite contexts have been widely investigated . unlike gr , where gravity couples to matter linearly in the sense that the einstein tensor @xmath11 is proportional to the stress - energy tensor @xmath12 in the einstein field equations , eibi gravity introduces nonlinear coupling between matter and gravity ( see section  [ sec : eibi ] ) .",
    "it is in fact the nonlinear matter - gravity coupling in this theory that is responsible for avoiding some of the singularities that plague gr @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been shown recently that the same nonlinear coupling leads to some pathologies , such as surface singularities @xcite and anomalies associated with phase transitions @xcite , for compact stars in eibi gravity .",
    "while the works of @xcite and @xcite cast doubt on its viability , eibi gravity certainly stands as an interesting example of a more general class of nonlinear matter - gravity coupling theories , due to its equivalence to gr in vacuum and its ability to avoid singularities .",
    "as discussed above , the theory differs from gr significantly only at high densities .",
    "since nss are the most dense stellar objects in the universe , eibi gravity thus provides us with an ideal test case to investigate how the universal relations of nss would change if the underlying gravitational theory is such that matter and gravity are nonlinearly coupled together . in this paper",
    ", we study the @xmath0-mode universality relations and the i - love - q relations in eibi gravity .",
    "thanks to the apparent - eos formulation of eibi gravity developed by @xcite , we are able to study the universal relations in eibi gravity using the same techniques as those in gr because in this formulation eibi gravity coupled to a perfect fluid is equivalent to gr with the matter field described by an effective eos ( see section  [ sec : eibi_apparenteos ] ) .",
    "we find that these universal relations are indeed very robust and independent of whether gravity is described by gr or eibi theory , as long as the coupling constant in eibi gravity is within the range that is already constrained astrophysically .",

    "the current tightest constraint on @xmath20 @xcite is set by the existence of nss and is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 .",
    "varying the action ( equation  ( [ eq : eibi_action ] ) ) with respect to the metric @xmath28 and @xmath16 separately yields @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an auxiliary metric compatible with the connection : @xmath31 since the matter action @xmath32 is assumed to depend only on the metric @xmath28 and the matter fields , but not on the connection @xmath16 , the stress - energy tensor @xmath33 still satisfies the same conservation equations as in gr @xmath34 where the covariant derivative refers to the physical metric @xmath28 .",

    "the advantage of reformulating eibi gravity in the form of equation  ( [ eq : modified_einstein ] ) has now become clear . for a given coupling parameter @xmath20 and a given physical eos @xmath58",
    ", one can solve a problem in eibi gravity by solving the same einstein equations ( equation  [ eq : modified_einstein ] ) ) as in gr , but with @xmath30 as the fundamental metric and an apparent eos @xmath59 given by equations ( [ eq : app_epsilon ] ) and ( [ eq : app_pressure ] ) .",
    "this implies that many theoretical ideas and numerical codes developed in gr can readily be transferred to eibi gravity .",
    "for instance , instead of solving the field equations ( equations  ( [ eq : field1 ] ) and ( [ eq : field2 ] ) ) for the structure of compact stars , as was originally done @xcite , one can simply solve the well - known tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations in gr with an apparent eos .",
    "the advantage of this reformulation of eibi gravity becomes even more transparent when one considers dynamical problems in eibi gravity , where the algebraic complexity in the analysis grows quite rapidly with the problem size .",

    "formulating the same calculation in eibi gravity starting with the field equations ( equations  ( [ eq : field1 ] ) and ( [ eq : field2 ] ) ) would be a more tedious task than in gr .",

    "the universal i - love - q relations in eibi theory are the same as the gr ones for the range of the coupling parameter @xmath20 , which has already been constrained astrophysically .",

    ", we find that the universal relations discovered in gr remain valid in eibi gravity .",
    "naively , since eibi gravity reduces to gr when the coupling constant @xmath20 vanishes , one might worry that the agreement between the universal relations in eibi gravity and those in gr is simply because the values of @xmath20 we consider are so small that the effect of nonlinear matter - gravity coupling in eibi gravity is not apparent .",

    "the effect of nonlinear matter - gravity coupling is not vanishingly small in our study . on the other hand ,",

    "as long as the stiffness of the resulting apparent eos is not significantly different from realistic nuclear eos models , which is the case in our study , it is then not surprising that the universal relations in the two theories are identical . for comparison",

    "while we have only focused on the range @xmath100 for the coupling parameter in this paper , we have in fact also considered a much larger range of @xmath20 and found that the universal relations are still valid .",
    "for instance , for @xmath108 , the relative fractional differences between the numerical results and the fitted universal curves still remain about 0.5% .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that such a large value of @xmath20 would lead to stellar configurations that are very different from typical nss observed in the universe ( e.g. , their masses can be much larger than @xmath109 ) .",
    "on the other hand , for a negative value of @xmath20 , we found that stellar configurations can not be constructed if @xmath20 is too negative since @xmath110 can not decrease continuously to zero as one integrates the stellar equations and hence the boundary conditions at the stellar surface can not be fulfilled ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the exact value of @xmath20 at which this would happen depends on the eos , but it is typically @xmath111 for our chosen eos models .",
    "finally , let us conclude with two remarks : ( 1 ) as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , eibi gravity is appealing because it reduces to gr in vacuum and can avoid some of the singularities that plague gr . if it was not due to the fact that eibi gravity suffers from some pathologies associated with compact stars @xcite , the theory would have one additional merit toward being a serious contender to gr because it has essentially the same non - trivial universal @xmath0-mode and i - love - q relations in the high - density regime as those in gr .",
    "it leaves one to wonder whether there exists any variation of eibi gravity or more generically a version of nonlinear matter - gravity coupling theory that could capture all the nice features of eibi gravity without suffering from any pathologies .",
    "( 2 ) it should be noted that the reason why there exist universal @xmath0-mode and i - love - q relations is not yet understood even in gr .",
    "@xcite suggested two possible reasons for the i - love - q relations : ( 1 ) the physical quantities considered depend most strongly on the ns outer layer , where the ignorance of the eos is smaller than that in the ns core and ( 2 ) the relations approach the black hole limit as the ns compactness increases , and hence the relations do not depend on the internal stellar structure .",
    "it is worth investigating whether these two suggestions are indeed the correct explanation for the i - love - q relations .",
    "it will also be interesting to study whether the two apparently different sets of @xmath0-mode and i - love - q universal relations have a common origin or not .",
