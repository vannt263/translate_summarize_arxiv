    "as mentioned earlier , it is quite crucial to get an accurate estimate of prompt photon production in nucleus - nucleus collisions , before we can begin to explore the initial conditions of the thermalized system .",
    "the success of phenix experiment in measuring the single photon production at large @xmath8 in @xmath12 collisions at rhic energies has brought this consideration into a sharp focus .",
    "thus , for example , it is now realized  @xcite that the ` suppression ' of single photons at large @xmath8 in @xmath12 collisions compared to those from @xmath5 collisions at the same nucleon - nucleon centre of mass energy has its origin predominantly in the difference of isospin for protons and neutrons ( or their valence quark structure ) .",
    "this is often overlooked when the @xmath5 data are scaled by the nuclear thickness @xmath13 , for the above comparison . of course , one additionally needs to account for effect of jet energy loss if a quark - gluon plasma is formed .",
    "the study of prompt photon production in @xmath5 collisions has reached a high degree of sophistication .",
    "all the available data have now been analyzed using nlo pqcd  @xcite and it is generally believed that choosing the factorization , renormalization , and fragmentation scales as equal to @xmath8/2 provides an excellent description to all the single photon data _ except _ for those from the e704  @xcite and the e706  @xcite experiments , without the requirement of any intrinsic @xmath6 .",
    "inclusion of intrinsic @xmath6 improves the description of the these data but simultaneously destroys the good agreement with all the other data .",
    "the e704 data is at @xmath14 19.4 gev , which is close to the @xmath15 17.3 gev relevant for the wa98 experiment .",
    "two other experiments na3  @xcite and e629  @xcite have measured single photon production from @xmath16 collisions at the same energy and these data are often used with a normalization by the mass - number of the target to estimate the @xmath5 data , even though half of the nucleons in the target are neutrons .",
    "we have verified that accounting for this reduces the theory values by about 2% at @xmath17 2 gev/@xmath0 and by about 15% for @xmath17 6 gev/@xmath0 , which is well below the other experimental uncertainties .",
    "we shall ignore this for the moment .",
    "we show our calculation for the single photon production at @xmath18= 19.4 gev in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , along with the data reported by the na3  @xcite ,  @xcite , and e629  @xcite experiments .",
    "we note that the fragmentation contribution at this energy is of the order of 30% of the compton + annihilation term .",
    "we also see that the nlo pqcd provides a good description of the na3 data , while it underestimates the e704 and e629 data by a factor of 26 .",
    "this has been noted by several studies as mentioned earlier  @xcite and it is known that these data deviate also from the @xmath19 scaling which all the other data follow  @xcite .",
    "we have verified that this scaling is in good agreement with the nlo pqcd results for values of @xmath8 up to about 4.5 gev/@xmath0 , but over - predicts the results considerablyat higher @xmath8 .",
    "we are discussing this point again as several studies have tried to accommodate these data by incorporating intrinsic @xmath6 for the partons , which is not favoured by the rest of the data .",
    "we must add though these results are among the earliest measurements of single photons , which may account for the inconsistency of data between different experiments and even within the same experiment  @xcite .",
    "recently , prompt photon production in @xmath16 and @xmath20 collisions at cern sps energy appropriate for the wa98 experiment  @xcite has been measured .",
    "only the upper limit of the single photon production could be deduced .",
    "we have verified that the upper limits are about a factor of 510 larger than the nlo pqcd calculations , though the slope of the data is described well by the calculations .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of intrinsic @xmath6 of partons is not easy even at lowest order of pqcd  @xcite and the results for nlo pqcd are often inferred by using a k - factor which describes the difference of results of lowest order pqcd with and without the intrinsic @xmath6 ( see also ref .",

    ", cronin effect also contributes to the broadening of the transverse momentum spectrum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was reported that this broadening by the cronin effect can lead to an enhancement of photon production by a factor of about 2.5 for @xmath8 of 24 gev/@xmath0 for the case of the wa98 experiment .",
    "our task of obtaining an accurate estimate of prompt photon production in @xmath10 collisions at @xmath21 17.3 gev is further complicated .",
    "firstly , there is no single photon production data from @xmath5 collisions at this energy . in any case",
    "there is no data for @xmath22 and @xmath23 collisions , which will also contribute to the production of prompt photons from lead nuclei .",
    "the importance of these can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we show our results for the effect of isospin and shadowing for prompt photon production at this energy .",
    "we see that effects of isospin and shadowing reduce the single photon production at @xmath24 4 gev/@xmath0 by about 30% for @xmath10 collisions compared to naive scaling of @xmath5 data by the nuclear thickness used in most of the early studies , including those involving one of the present authors  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the inclusion of shadowing leads to a significant variation in the end result so that at lower transverse momenta , the single photon production goes up .",
    "the middle and the lower panels of the figure show the results for @xmath25 scaling with the inclusion of iso - spin and parton shadowing at sps , rhic , and lhc energies@xcite .",
    "the deviations from a scaling behaviour are due to the scale dependence of the structure functions and the qcd interactions  @xcite .    in the light of the discussions above we take the following view for getting the yield of prompt photons for @xmath10 collisions at an energy corresponding to the wa98 experiment . for a given impact parameter @xmath26 , we first estimate the effective number of protons and neutrons from the number of participants : @xmath27 where @xmath28\\nonumber\\\\ & & + t_b(x{-}{b}/{2},y ) % \\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left[1-\\left(1- { \\sigma t_a(x{+}{b}/{2},y)}/{a}\\right)^a\\right]\\big\\}\\ , .",

    "the nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross - section @xmath35 is set to 32 mb relevant for the @xmath21 17.3 gev .",
    "now we assume that the effective number of protons from the projectile or the target which constitute the participants at a given impact parameter @xmath26 is given by ; @xmath36 with a similar expression for the effective number of neutrons .",
    "these numbers then decide the shadowing functions @xmath37 as well as the effective structure functions , @xmath38 for the prompt photon calculations .",
    "we multiply the cross - sections for the production of photons from the `` effective '' nucleon - nucleon collisions using nlo pqcd , with the nuclear overlap function ; @xmath39 to get the yield of prompt photons .",
    "finally the yield is averaged over the impact - parameter range covered by the centrality of the collision .",
    "we have already noted that the importance of thermal photons lies in their sensitivity to initial conditions . the simplest and most widely used initial conditions assume formation of a hot , thermalized , and chemically equilibrated quark gluon plasma at some initial time @xmath9 , beyond which the system expands isentropically ignoring the viscosity effect .",
    "this makes the powerful methods of hydrodynamics available to us .",
    "one may also use a parametrized fire - ball to describe the evolution of the system .    for this study , we employ a boost invariant hydrodynamics @xcite as our model of the underlying bulk evolution , especially for the purpose of obtaining the initial energy and temperature distributions .",
    "this model has been used extensively to explore and hadron production and elliptic flow of hadrons as well as photons  @xcite and dileptons  @xcite . for the sps energies under consideration ,",
    "the initial conditions are estimated by assuming  @xcite that the deposited energy in the transverse plane is proportional to the number of wounded - nucleons  @xcite ( or participants ) ; @xmath40\\nonumber\\\\ % & + & t_b(x-\\frac{b}{2},y)\\times\\nonumber\\\\ % & & \\left[1-\\left(1- % \\frac{\\sigma t_a(x+\\frac{b}{2},y)}{a}\\right)^a\\right]\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a constant and @xmath41 is given in eq.([eq : nuxyb ] ) .",
    "we further assume , as in ref .",

    "@xcite have shown that taking @xmath9 = 0.8 fm/@xmath0 along with @xmath1 = 2.04 gev / fm and @xmath43 = 0.122 gev@xmath44 provides a remarkably quantitative description of the particle spectra measured for the @xmath10 collisions at @xmath45gev , using the equation of state q , which provides that the thermally and chemically equilibrated qgp undergoes a first order phase transition to hadrons at @xmath46 164 mev .",
    "we have checked that these values give a quantitative description of the deposited transverse energy measured by the wa98 experiment  @xcite for central collisions .    in the present work we use these values for @xmath1 , @xmath43 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we additionally explore the consequences of varying @xmath9 such that the rapidity density of total entropy , @xmath47 , and net baryons , @xmath48 , remains fixed ( see ref.@xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "this is attained by taking the entropy density @xmath49 and then using @xmath50 and @xmath51 as constants , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this corresponds to an isentropic expansion .",
    "note that the shape of the these distributions are taken as independent of @xmath9 .",
    "thus we have used @xmath54 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 1.0 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "these then correspond to the peak temperature , @xmath55 of 420 , 330 , 284 , 257 , and 238 mev respectively , while the average temperatures are 380 , 295 , 257 , 233 , and 215 mev , respectively .      as a first step",
    "we determine the time - evolution of the average energy density , average temperature , and the average transverse velocity of the expanding system obtained from the hydrodynamic calculations for a central collision .",
    "we take the average by defining , @xmath56 we note ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) that in the over - lapping time - span , the variations of these quantities are quite similar , though an earlier start leads to a slightly larger build - up of the flow velocity and a faster cooling of the system . in the final stages",
    "the temperatures and the velocities do not differ beyond about 10% for different initial times , though the energy density varies by about 40% ( as it varies as @xmath57 ) .",
    "photons are sensitive to the initial temperature .",
    "therefore , an earlier initial time with higher initial temperature will lead to a considerably enhanced production of photons at higher transverse momenta . on the other hand , this should not affect the spectra of hadrons since they are emitted at much later freeze - out stage when the effect of having different initial times is mostly washed out .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have shown the time - evolution of the average effective temperature ( or the blue - shifted temperature ) to see the combined effect of the cooling and expansion ( velocity ) .",
    "we define the effective temperature as , @xmath58 we note that as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the results differ only marginally beyond the time of about 1 fm/@xmath0 , confirming once again our surmise that the difference in the production of thermal photons should mostly arise from contributions before this time .",
    "we calculate the production of thermal photons by folding the history of the evolution of the system with the rate for the production of photons from the quark matter and the hadronic matter .",
    "we use the complete leading - order results for the production of photons from the qgp from arnold , moore , and yaffe  @xcite and the latest results for the radiation of photons from a hot hadronic gas obtained by turbide , rapp , and gale  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the equation of state ( eos q  @xcite ) incorporating a phase transition to quark gluon plasma at @xmath59 164 mev , and resonance gas for the hadronic phase below the energy density of 0.45 gev/@xmath60 is used to describe the evolution .",
    "the mixed phase is described using maxwell s construction .",
    "the freeze - out is assumed to take place at @xmath61 0.075 gev/@xmath62 .",
    "final results are obtained by taking an average of the results over the range of impact parameters @xmath26 between 0 and 4.6 fm corresponding to 010% most central collisions , considered by the wa98 experiment .",
    "we summarize our results for the case of @xmath9 = 0.2 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.8 , and 1.0 fm/@xmath0 in figs .",
    "[ fig5],[fig6],[fig7],[fig8],[fig9 ] .",
    "as expected from the discussion earlier , we find that the hadronic matter contribution to the single photons is only marginally altered as we increase the initial time or decrease the initial temperature .",
    "the quark matter contribution at large @xmath8 however drops as the initial time is increased ( the initial temperature increased ) .",
    "we note that the prompt photon production is about 17% of the total yield .",
    "noting that these are nlo results , the lowest order prompt photon production is perhaps only of the order of 10% of the total single photon production measured in the experiment .",
    "we also note that the thermal production of photons is almost identical to the prompt photon production when @xmath9 = 0.4 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "we have also shown the results for the `` thermal+@xmath63 @xmath64 prompt '' photon contribution , with @xmath63 adjusted to reproduce the experimental results at @xmath8 = 2.55 gev/@xmath0 .",
    "it is good to see that the same normalization provides a good description to the entire @xmath8 range in every case ( see middle panels ) .",
    "we find that scaling the prompt photon results by factors of 2.7 , 4.9 , 5.4 , 5.7 , and 5.9 , respectively are necessary in order to provide a _ quantitative _ description of experimental results .",
    "we can perhaps argue that @xmath63 accounts for the cronin effect in case of nucleus - nucleus collisions as well as pre - equilibirum contributions which must surely be accounted for when @xmath9 is large .",
    "we do know that the pre - equilibrium electromagnetic radiations look thermal in nature  @xcite , and we have noted that in the present case , the prompt and the thermal contributions have similar slopes , for large initial temperatures    even though a value of @xmath9 = 0.2 fm/@xmath0 may be considered too small , let us not forget that in this notation the nuclei would start interacting at @xmath65 or at about @xmath66fm/@xmath0 , and thus a hot and dense system can be considered to be formed soon after the complete overlap , which occurs at @xmath67 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "let us try to see if some additional experimental result could actually distinguish between the different values for @xmath9 , and thus in a potentially interesting observation , we note ( see lower panels of figs .",
    "[ fig5],[fig6],[fig7],[fig8 ] , [ fig9 ] ) , that the elliptic flow parameter @xmath2 for the thermal photons  @xcite is quite sensitive to the formation time @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "we also note the peak at low @xmath8 in the @xmath68 , first noted by authors of ref .",
    "@xcite and interpreted as a consequence of competition of @xmath69 and @xmath70 reactions .",
    "we note that as we decrease @xmath9 , the contribution of the quark matter increases . as this contribution arises from earlier times , where the momentum anisotropies are smaller , decreasing @xmath9 thus leads to an overall reduction in @xmath2 for thermal photons .",
    "even though the azimuthal anisotropies for these fairly central collisions are small , they reveal an important sensitivity to the formation time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "note also the inversion of order of the results for @xmath2 with increasing @xmath9 with and without accounting for the non - thermal component ) .",
    "let us pause here to consider a question which has troubled the analysis of single photons from the wa98 experiment , from the very beginning . in the present work ,",
    "we have started with the assumption of a formation of qgp at time @xmath9 .",
    "however , several studies have also  @xcite presented a reasonable description of the data by assuming only the formation of a hot hadronic gas in the collision without ever forming a qgp . which is the right scenario , then ?",
    "we note here that the photon @xmath2 provides a possible resolution to this question .",
    "if no qgp is formed , then the @xmath2 for thermal photons will closely follow the @xmath68 for @xmath71 mesons at larger @xmath8 .",
    "hence , it will be considerably larger than our prediction and also will rise monotonically  @xcite as @xmath8 increases .",
    "this suggests that a measurement of the @xmath2 of thermal photons along with their spectra could very firmly distinguish between the two scenarios .",
    "coming back to our present discussion , we note that the results for @xmath2 for direct photons will be modified from the values for the thermal photons due to the presence of prompt photons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "however , the _ prompt photons as well as the pre - equilibrium photons _ will not contribute to the azimuthal anisotropy of the photon distribution , as they are not subjected to any collectivity .",
    "we can safely neglect the small effect of azimuthal dependence of jet - quenching which may affect the fragmentation photons ( which is less than about 30% of the prompt contribution in the present case ) or those of jet - induced photons  @xcite , which measure the anisotropy of the initial state  @xcite .",
    "this is because the qgp , if formed at the sps , is very short lived and not very hot , as indicated by a small jet - quenching ( not exceeding about 2530% ) for such collisions  @xcite .",
    "we show the results for final @xmath2 for single photons for the case of the wa98 experiment in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "we finally recall a completely different calculation using the parton cascade model  @xcite for this case , where the scattering and radiating partons produced a not - so - dense partonic system , but it was enough to reproduce the single photon production seen by the wa98 experiment beyond about 3 gev/@xmath0 , _ if _ the partonic distributions are given an intrinsic @xmath72 of about 0.44 gev/@xmath0 . in absence of the intrinsic @xmath73",
    "the production is smaller by a factor of about 2 .",
    "these photons can be considered as due to prompt and the pre - equilibrium contributions .",
    "we have so far assumed that the prompt and pre - equilibrium photons and their enhanced production due to intrinsic @xmath6 can be estimated by using a multiplicative factor @xmath63 to the nlo pqcd results . within this approach",
    ", we have ascertained that the photon observables , especially the @xmath2 , are sensitive measures of the initial condition .",
    "admittedly , there are some uncertainties in our approach such as the nlo contribution to the thermal photon production and the effect of the viscous hydrodynamic evolution . at present , their effects are unknown although the effect of the finite viscosity on photons may soon be calculated@xcite",
    ".      how will the reported good description of particle spectra  @xcite obtained using @xmath54 0.8 fm/@xmath0 , be affected , if a different value is used for @xmath9 ?",
    "instead of discussing a complete calculation ( with resonance decay accounted for ) , we show the primary spectra of pions , rho mesons , and protons for a typical impact parameter @xmath26 = 7 fm , for different values of @xmath9 , but keeping the entropy fixed as in the calculations discussed above ( see figs .  [ fig11],[fig12],[fig13 ] ) .",
    "we note that as the inverse slope for all the cases rises with decrease in @xmath9 as the radial flow sets in earlier .",
    "we have checked that the increase in the inverse slope for pions is about 11% , about 15% rho mesons and protons as the initial time is decreased from 1 fm/@xmath0 to 0.2 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "we also note that the change in the spectra for the primary particles is quite marginal for @xmath8 below 1.5 gev/@xmath0 , even though it varies by a factor of about 3 at @xmath24 3 gev/@xmath0 .",
    "what is most interesting is that the differential elliptic flow parameter @xmath2 for hadrons is almost independent of the initial time .",
    "we conclude then , that the good description of hadronic spectra for low transverse momenta at sps energies will remain unaffected by the reduction of initial time from 1 fm/@xmath0 to 0.2 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "this is in contrast to what we saw earlier for thermal photons .",
    "we have re - analyzed the single photon production in @xmath10 collisions at the cern sps energies for 10% most central collisions .",
    "several improvements have been incorporated .",
    "the iso - spin , shadowing , and impact parameter dependence of the prompt photon production are explicitly included .",
    "nlo pqcd calculations are performed with the factorization , fragmentation , and renormalization scales fixed at @xmath74 based on a global description of the available data for @xmath5 collisions . for the thermal photons calculations",
    "the initial conditions are taken as those which provided a good description to hadronic spectra , with a @xmath9 = 0.8 fm/@xmath0 .",
    "we explored the consequences of using smaller initial times , keeping the entropy and the net - baryon number fixed .",
    "we find that the data can be explained using a small formation @xmath9 of the order of 0.2 fm/@xmath0 when supplemented with prompt photons evaluated at nlo pqcd with a @xmath63 factor @xmath75 2.7 to account for the cronin effect .",
    "larger initial times require much larger values for @xmath63 , which may be mimicking the pre - equilibrium contribution .",
    "a unique sensitivity to the formation time is seen in the photon elliptic flow , which could be useful in ascertaining whether a qgp was formed at the sps energy .",

    "<S> we present a reanalysis of single photon production from relativistic collision of lead nuclei at cern sps measured by the wa98 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the refinements include use of iso - spin and shadowing corrected nlo pqcd treatment for prompt photon production using an optimized scale for factorization , renormalization , and fragmentation and use of hydrodynamics suited for non - central collisions along with a well tested equation of state admitting a quark - hadron phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative explanation of the data requires a large initial temperature ( at a small formation time of about 0.2 fm/@xmath0 ) and a moderate increase in the prompt yield which could perhaps be attributed to the cronin effect in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the data can also be explained using a moderate initial temperature ( at a formation time of about 1 fm/@xmath0 ) with a very large @xmath1-factor multiplying the prompt yield . </S>",
    "<S> we show that different initial times give rise to different values for the elliptic flow parameter @xmath2 for thermal photons . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that a measurement of @xmath2 for thermal photons could also distinguish between the scenarios with or without a phase transition . </S>"
