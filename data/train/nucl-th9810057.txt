    "the triple  alpha process occurring in helium burning of red giants is of special significance with respect to the anthropic principle @xcite .",
    "the anthropic principle deals with the question if our universe is tailor  made for the evolution of life . in other words , could life also have evolved in the universe , if the values of the fundamental constants or the initial conditions in the big bang were different .",
    "the reason for the relevance of the triple  alpha process with respect to the anthropic principle lies in the fact that one has to deal with physical quantities that lie in the realm of experimentally verifiable and theoretically calculable physics .",
    "this is for instance hardly the case for the rather uncertain and complicated science necessary for the description the big bang as well as for the creation and evolution of life on earth .",
    "the formation of @xmath2c through hydrogen burning is blocked by the absence of stable elements for the mass number @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "pik and salpeter pointed out @xcite that the lifetime of @xmath0be is long enough , so that the @xmath5@xmath0be reaction can produce macroscopic amounts of equilibrium @xmath0be in stars .",
    "then , the unstable @xmath0be could capture an additional @xmath6particle to produce stable @xmath2c .",
    "however , this so  called triple ",
    "alpha reaction has very low rate since the density of @xmath0be in the stellar plasma is very low because of its short lifetime of 10@xmath7s .",
    "hoyle argued @xcite that in order to explain the measured abundance of carbon in the universe , the triple  alpha reaction can not produce enough carbon in a non  resonant way , but must proceed through a hypothetical resonance of @xmath2c , thus strongly enhancing the cross section .",
    "hoyle suggested that this resonance is a @xmath8 state at about @xmath9 mev ( throughout this paper @xmath10 denotes resonance energy in the center - of - mass frame relative to the three - alpha threshold , while @xmath11 denotes the full width ) .",
    "subsequent experiments indeed found a @xmath12 resonance in @xmath2c in the predicted energy region @xcite .",
    "it is the second @xmath12 state ( @xmath13 ) in @xmath2c .",
    "its modern parameters @xmath14mev and @xmath15mev @xcite agree well with the old theoretical prediction .    in the following we discuss in sect .  2 the used methods , i.e. , the microscopic three  cluster model , the effective nucleon",
    " nucleon ( nn ) interactions , and the complex scaling method . in sect .  3 we present the results for the triple  alpha reaction rates using different strengths of the nn  interaction . in sect .  4 we discuss the astrophysical consequences of the obtained results .",
    "our model is the a microscopic three  cluster ( @xmath6 + @xmath6 + @xmath6 ) resonating group model approach to the 12nucleon system . solving the 12nucleon schrdinger equation using a three ",
    "cluster trial function we get an equation for the intercluster relative wave function representing the three  body dynamics of the @xmath2c states .    in order to avoid any possible model dependence of the conclusion we use three different effective nn  interactions : the minnesota ( mn ) force designed to reproduce low  energy scattering data @xcite , while the rather different volkov 1 ( v1 ) and 2 ( v2 ) forces where obtained from fitting the bulk properties of s and p  shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "each force contains an exchange mixture parameter , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the parameters were chosen to reproduce the experimental resonance energy of @xmath18mev for the @xmath13state in @xmath2c ( mn : @xmath19 ; v1 : @xmath20 ; v1 : @xmath21 ) .",
    "the three ",
    "body resonance energies for the @xmath13state were determined by using the complex scaling method ( csm ) .",
    "it reduces the problem of asymptotically divergent resonant states to that of bound states , and can handle the coulomb interaction without any problem",
    ".    a more detailed discussion of the model described in this section can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we investigate the change of the reaction rate by varying the strength of all attractive and repulsive terms of the effective nn  potential through multiplication with a factor @xmath22 .",
    "the consequences for triple  alpha reaction rate will be investigated , if this factor is changed by a very small amount of the order of 0.1% .",
    "the reaction rate for the triple  alpha process proceeding via the ground state of @xmath0be and the @xmath13resonance in @xmath2c is given by @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the mass and the number density of the @xmath6particle , respectively .",
    "the temperature of the stellar plasma is given by @xmath26 .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 denotes the difference in energy between the @xmath13resonance in @xmath2c and the 3@xmath6particle threshold .",
    "the resonance strength @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 the approximation of the above expression for the decay widths of the @xmath13resonance follows , because for the @xmath6width @xmath29 , radiation width @xmath30 , the electromagnetic decay width @xmath31 to the first excited state of @xmath2c , and for the electron ",
    "positron pair emission decay width @xmath32 into the ground state of @xmath2c the following approximations hold : ( i ) @xmath33 and ( ii ) @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( 1 ) can therefore approximated by : @xmath35 the two quantities in eq .",
    "( 3 ) that change its value by varying the effective nn ",
    "interaction is the energy of the @xmath13resonance @xmath10 in @xmath2c and its electromagnetic decay width @xmath31 . in table 1",
    "we show the change of the energy @xmath36 of the @xmath13resonance with respect to the 3@xmath6threshold in @xmath2c as a function of the multiplication of the strength factor @xmath22 for the three effective nn ",

    "furthermore , the model dependence due to the different used effective nn  interaction for @xmath38 is less than one order of magnitude , and therefore much less than the before mentioned enhancement or reduction . tables 1 and 2 also show at least for the considered small variations of the effective nn ",

    "a lowering of the @xmath41 resonance energy by about 60kev corresponding to a 0.20.4% strengthening of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon interaction would lead to about a fourfold increase of the carbon production in a 20@xmath40 star .",
