    "general relativity is a very successful theory in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "however , the theory faces some challenges which are often summarised as the dark matter and the dark energy problem .",
    "the dark matter problem manifests itself , for instance , in flattened galactic rotation curves .",
    "dark matter is an important ingredient for the dynamics of the entire universe and accounts for approximately 27% its matter content , with dark energy making up about 68% , with the remainder being ordinary matter . on the other hand ,",
    "dark energy is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . in principle",
    "one could accept the cosmological constant @xmath2 as an additional ingredient of physics , however , this causes substantial problems once the cosmological term is interpreted as a vacuum expectation value  @xcite .",
    "modifications of general relativity ( gr ) started being considered almost immediately after the formulation of the theory .",
    "many of those early studies were concerned with incorporating electromagnetism into the new geometrical framework , with advances in other branches of theoretical physics motivating a large variety of models .",
    "one such approach is based on a geometrical result going back to weitzenbck who observed that it is always possible to define a specific connection such that the space is globally flat .",
    "the geometrical framework is a manifold with curvature and torsion equipped with the so - called weitzenbck connection .",
    "this forms the basis of what is now called the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) , see e.g.  @xcite and also  @xcite . in the standard gr framework ,",
    "the metric contains the gravitational potentials which are responsible for the curvature of spacetime . on the other hand , in the teleparallel framework the gravitational fields",
    "are represented by the torsion tensor with the curvature not being important . while both formulations are equivalent , their interpretations are quite different .",
    "for instance , both formulations are invariant under local lorentz transformations , however , in gr all geometrical quantities are naturally lorentz scalars while in tegr expressions typically depend on the chosen frame .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the classes of models known as @xmath0 gravity and @xmath1 gravity  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that @xmath1 gravity is not invariant under local lorentz transformations because the torsion scalar @xmath3 is not an invariant under them either , the ricci scalar and the torsion scalar differ by a total derivative term . however , the resulting @xmath1 gravity theory is a second order theory , unlike @xmath0 gravity which contains fourth derivatives . by taking a fresh look at these models",
    "we derive the teleparallel equivalent of @xmath0 gravity as a particular subset of models depending on the torsion scalar and a boundary term .",
    "we establish that this is the unique theory in this class that is invariant under local lorentz transformation .",
    "furthermore we can show that @xmath1 gravity is the unique theory admitting second order field equations .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : section  [ sec : tegr ] gives a brief introduction to teleparallel gravity .",
    "section  [ sec : ftbgravity ] defines our theory and discusses its main features .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we work with metric with signature @xmath4 , latin indices indicate tangents space coordinates whereas greek indices correspond to spacetime coordinates .",
    "let us begin by briefly introducing teleparallel gravity and its generalisation to @xmath1 gravity .",
    "our dynamical variables are the tetrad fields @xmath5 , and inverse tetrads @xmath6 where latin indices indicate tangents space coordinates whereas greek indices correspond to spacetime coordinates .    the fundamental relationships between the metric @xmath7 , the inverse metric @xmath8 and the tetrads and inverse tetrads are @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the minkowski metric with signature @xmath4 .",
    "the tetrad @xmath5 and the inverse tetrad @xmath6 satisfy @xmath11 we define @xmath12 to be the determinant of the tetrad @xmath13 , which is equivalent to the volume element of the metric , so that @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the determinant of the metric . in what follows ,",
    "the conventions of  @xcite are used .",
    "general relativity is a metric theory of gravity without additional geometrical objects being considered .",
    "the riemann curvature tensor is constructed from the levi - civita connection which then gives rise to the standard einstein tensor and the well known einstein field equations .",
    "however , there exists an equivalent formulation based on a globally flat space where gravity is described by torsion instead of curvature . that this is indeed possible is not trivial and",
    "is based on the work of weitzenbck who noted that by choosing the connection in a specific way it is possible to ensure that space is indeed globally flat .    in the teleparallel formulation of general relativity one",
    "works with the so - called weitzenbck connection . to begin with",
    "we define the object @xmath16 by @xmath17 the torsion tensor is the antisymmetric part of @xmath16 so that @xmath18 or in terms of spacetime indices as @xmath19    one can relate the levi - civita connection @xmath20 and the weitzenbck connection as follows @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the contortion tensor which in turn can be expressed using the torsion tensor as @xmath23 it is clear that the contortion tensor @xmath24 is antisymmetric in its last two indices .",
    "one also defines the torsion vector @xmath25 as the following contraction @xmath26    let us calculate the ricci scalar of the levi - civita connection in terms of torsion .",
    "one arrives at the following relation @xmath27 see also  @xcite .",
    "this can be divided by @xmath12 and yields @xmath28 which can also be written as @xmath29 where the tensor @xmath30 is defined as follows @xmath31 its form in spacetime coordinates is given by @xmath32    frequently the combination @xmath33 is referred to simply as the torsion scalar @xmath3 .",
    "this results in a neat form of ( [ riccis ] ) which then reads @xmath34 and forms the principal starting point for teleparallel gravity . by definition ,",
    "the ricci scalar is invariant under local lorentz transformations .",
    "this can not be said for the torsion scalar @xmath3 or the boundary term , while the particular combination @xmath35 is invariant , the individual terms are not .",
    "as we will study the boundary term in some detail we introduce the notation @xmath36    the action of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) is given by @xmath37 and the usual einstein - hilbert action of general relativity is given by @xmath38 identity  ( [ riccit ] ) shows that the actions @xmath39 and @xmath40 only differ by a total derivative term which implies that the field equations derived from either of the two actions are equivalent . clearly",
    ", both theories are also invariant under local lorentz transformations .",
    "a well studied modification of gr is to consider @xmath0 gravity  @xcite where @xmath41 is an arbitrary ( sufficiently smooth ) function of the ricci scalar @xmath42 recall that the ricci scalar depends on second derivatives of the metric tensor .",
    "hence variations with respect to the metric will require integration by parts twice which will result in terms of the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 , making the theory fourth order .    in analogy one can consider @xmath1 gravity @xmath45 in the tegr framework  @xcite .",
    "since the torsion scalar @xmath3 only depends on the first derivatives of the tetrads , this theory is a second order theory .",
    "however , since @xmath1 does not differ from @xmath0 by a total derivative term , these theories are no longer equivalent . moreover , since @xmath3 itself is not invariant under local lorentz transformations , @xmath1 gravity is also not locally lorentz invariant  @xcite .",
    "hence , there is a trade - off between second order field equations and local lorentz invariance .",
    "we will now consider a general framework which includes both @xmath0 gravity and @xmath1 gravity as special sub - cases .",

    "one verifies immediately that this is the unique form of the function @xmath41 which will give second order field equations . recall that linear terms in the boundary term @xmath60 do not affect the field equations .",
    "therefore , the generic field equations contain terms of the form @xmath61 which are always of fourth order and can vanish if and only if @xmath62 is a constant , so that @xmath41 is linear in the boundary term .    therefore , for a nonlinear function @xmath41 , @xmath1 gravity is the only possible second order modified theory of gravity constructed out of @xmath63 , @xmath3 and @xmath60 . as mentioned before , the price to pay is the violation of local lorentz invariance .      here",
    "we will show carefully how we recover standard @xmath0 gravity in this model , and also find the teleparallel equivalent of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "starting with  ( [ riccit ] ) , we have @xmath64 which suggests to consider our function @xmath41 to be of the particular form @xmath65 we also introduce the standard notation for the derivative of @xmath41 from @xmath0 gravity @xmath66    inserting this form of function into our general @xmath46 field equation  ( [ fieldeq ] ) leads to the following field equations @xmath67 this equation gives us the teleparallel equivalent of @xmath0 gravity ( although for simplicity we have expressed this equation using covariant derivatives @xmath68 of the levi - civita connection , these can easily be rewritten in the teleparallel framework using the relation @xmath69 ) .",
    "as this is not an obvious observation , let us prove this statement by rewriting the field equations in their usual way based on the ricci tensor and metric tensor .",
    "we can rewrite the fourth term in  ( [ frtele ] ) as @xmath70 inserting this back into  ( [ frtele ] ) gives @xmath71 next , we need to replace the torsion components with curvature .",
    "the ricci tensor satisfies the identity @xmath72 we can rewrite this to derive the following identity @xmath73 using this final identity  ( [ eq10b ] ) , it is then easy to see that the field equations reduce to the @xmath0 field equations in standard form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the energy - momentum tensor . thus we conclude that equation  ( [ frtele ] ) is the teleparallel equivalent of @xmath0 gravity .      as in the previous subsection ,",
    "let us rewrite our general field equation in a covariant form in terms of the einstein tensor and the metric .",

    "however , it is not in general invariant under local lorentz transformations .",
    "a necessary condition for the equation to be lorentz invariant is for the antisymmetric part of the equation to be identically zero , so the coefficient of @xmath80 must vanish identically , see for example  @xcite .",
    "requiring this gives two conditions @xmath81 which can be satisfied if we choose @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a constant of integration .",
    "solving this gives us a general @xmath41 of the form @xmath84 since @xmath60 is a total derivative term , the resulting field equations are unchanged by terms linear in @xmath60 .",
    "hence , we can set @xmath85 without loss of generality .",
    "we already showed that an @xmath41 of this form simply reduces to the @xmath0 field equations , which are manifestly lorentz invariant .",
    "hence we can conclude that the above field equations are lorentz invariant if and only if they are equivalent to @xmath0 gravity .",
    "therefore , the teleparallel equivalent of @xmath0 gravity is the only possible lorentz invariant theory of gravity constructed out of @xmath63 , @xmath3 and @xmath60 .",
    "conversely to the above , the price to pay is the presence of higher order derivative terms .",
    "requiring the matter action to be invariant under both local lorentz transformations and infinitesimal coordinate transformations gives the condition that @xmath86 is symmetric and divergence free @xmath87 as shown in  @xcite .",
    "hence we require the left - hand side of our field equations to also have this property .",

    "this means that on shell the left - hand side of the field equations are conserved .",
    "the principal aim of this work was to complete our understanding of the relationship between different models of modified gravity in the context of @xmath0 and @xmath1 gravity .",
    "our results can be visualised using fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the starting point is a gravitational action based on an arbitrary function @xmath46 which depends on the torsion scalar and a torsion boundary term .",
    "if this function is assumed to be independent of the boundary term , one arrives at @xmath1 gravity which we identified as the unique second order gravitational theory in this approach .",
    "likewise , if the function takes the special form @xmath95 , we find the teleparallel equivalent of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "this theory is identified as the unique locally lorentz invariant theory .",
    "any other form of @xmath46 will result in gravitational theories which are neither of second order nor locally lorentz invariant .",
    "based on these considerations , one could study some interesting physical models using the teleparallel framework .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to couple a scalar field to this boundary term and study its cosmological applications .",
    "clearly , one will be able to establish a direct link between brans - dicke type theories and their teleparallel counterparts  @xcite .",
    "however , couplings to the boundary term will result in some new dynamics which will be interesting to study  @xcite .    as discussed in the above , neither the torsion scalar @xmath3 nor the boundary term @xmath60 are invariant under local lorentz transformations",
    ". this might be useful when studying metric theories of gravity which already break this invariance , for instance theories containing a preferred direction , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "one could reformulate these theories using the teleparallel framework and choose suitable coupling terms containing the boundary term so that the resulting theory becomes invariant under local lorentz transformations .",
    "this will not be possible for any theory violating local lorentz invariance , however , for some models this approach will yield a new invariant theory .",
