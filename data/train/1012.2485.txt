    "the study of the angular distribution of lepton pairs in hadron collisions allowed the test of the drell - yan model @xcite and of its corrections in perturbative qcd @xcite , and verified the electro - weak couplings of w and z bosons .",
    "more recently , angular distributions have been suggested in order to discriminate among different production models for @xmath0 states @xcite in hadron collisions .",
    "available results on @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances @xcite do not provide a complete and consistent picture @xcite .",
    "this is in part due to limited acceptance ranges , which prevent a full analysis of the polarization of the resonance , and also to different choices of reference system .",
    "new data from lhc is eagerly awaited .",
    "recent studies @xcite have discussed the relevance of taking directly into account properties related to the description of the process in different frames , and have specified rotation - invariant quantities that provide information on intrinsic , frame independent properties of the polarization of the @xmath0 state .",
    "the work presented here extends along the same direction , under the assumption of parity conservation .",
    "we provide a geometrical description of the transformation of the different terms of the angular distribution , and specify new invariant quantities that relate all the components .",
    "we also establish physical bounds and consistency relations among all terms of the angular distribution .",
    "the angular distribution of the lepton pair in its rest frame is described by : @xmath3/(1+{\\lambda_\\theta}/3 ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath4 and @xmath5 identify as usual the direction of the positive lepton , with @xmath5=0 corresponding to the production plane of the vector meson . in hadron collisions ,",
    "different choices have been made for the axis @xmath6 , including those that approximate the collision axis , like the collins - soper ( cs ) frame @xcite and the _ t_-channel / gottfried - jackson frame @xcite , or the helicity ( h ) frame , that selects the direction of the pair in the c.m .",
    "system of the collision .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : basic ] ) makes the assumption of parity conservation and symmetry for reflection on the production plane , and its validity covers both the case of elementary processes , where the coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are directly related to the helicity amplitudes of the vector meson , or the case of different , uncorrelated processes contributing to the angular distribution .",
    "a change of frame ( _ e.g. _ : between cs and h ) corresponds to a rotation about the @xmath10-axis . under a rotation by @xmath11 the functional dependences in ( [ eq : basic ] )",
    "are preserved if the coefficients of the angular distribution are transformed as : @xmath12 where @xmath13 enters as a change in the normalization .    from ( [ eq : transf ] ) we see that we can always define a rotation to a frame in which @xmath14 , by means of a rotation by the angle @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) satisfying : @xmath17",
    "if @xmath9=0 the reference frame is _ oriented _ along the principal axes of symmetry of the angular distribution . we shall first discuss properties of the components of the angular distribution for this choice of frame .",
    "particular cases of angular distribution include : ( a )  _ longitudinal _ polarization along the @xmath6-axis ( @xmath7=1 , @xmath8=@xmath9=0 ) : @xmath18 ( b )  _ transverse(-z ) _ polarization , which conventionally refers to the case @xmath7=+1 , @xmath8=@xmath9=0 and is described by : @xmath19 transverse polarization implies that the contributing processes select the vector meson in a state of definite helicity ( @xmath20=+1 or @xmath20=1 ) along the same axis @xmath6 .",
    "neglecting the mass of the leptons , the pairs have always @xmath21=@xmath221 along their axis , and the @xmath23 distribution is determined by the sum of the squares of the d@xmath24 and d@xmath25 terms in the wigner matrix . similarly , the longitudinal polarization corresponds to @xmath20=0 along the same axis for all contributing processes .",
    "the transverse(-@xmath6 ) angular distribution can be expressed as a sum of longitudinal@xmath26 and longitudinal@xmath10 distributions : @xmath27 a similar relation can be written for any angular distribution described in the oriented frame .",
    "in fact , terms proportional to @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can not be present because of the symmetry assumptions contained in ( [ eq : basic ] ) and in the definition of oriented frame .",
    "we therefore argue that any angular distribution in the oriented frame can be described by the sum of the three ( longitudinal ) contributions referred to the reference axes : @xmath31 the coefficients @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are non  negative and satisfy @xmath35 , so that we can choose @xmath33 , @xmath36 as independent variables and write : @xmath37 writing ( [ eq : abc ] ) explicitly and comparing with ( [ eq : basic ] ) , we obtain the relations : @xmath38 where @xmath39=@xmath40 . from these equations and the limits ( [ eq : lim - abc ] )",
    "we see that : could have also been obtained from ( [ eq : transf ] ) and requiring that @xmath411 for any angle @xmath11 @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath42 frame rotations in the space of the coefficients ------------------------------------------------    applying the transformation  ( [ eq : transf ] ) to sets of values on an oriented frame ( @xmath9=0 ) , we can analyze properties of the angular distribution in any frame .",
    "figure  [ fig : ellipses ] illustrates the transformation in the three - dimensional space of @xmath43 : the coefficients vary following closed loops , with mirror symmetry on the plane @xmath44 before proving that the loops are ellipses ( section  [ sec : limit3 ] ) , we can list the following properties : ( a )  the loops are wound about the line : @xmath7 = @xmath8 , @xmath9=0 ; ( b )  they are contained in planes orthogonal to the plane @xmath9=0 ; ( c )  for each plane , the ellipsis of largest size is the one connecting the boundary lines @xmath7=1 and @xmath8=+0.5(@xmath7 + 1 ) on the plane @xmath9=0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : cone ] shows the envelope of the ellipses of maximum size , which is a cone in the 3d space . clearly , the limits ( [ eq : limit2 ] ) are valid in any frame and the range of @xmath9 depends on @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the geometrical description illustrates properties of the dependence of the coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 on the rotation angle @xmath11 that may not be immediately evident from the the transformations  ( [ eq : transf ] ) , including : ( a ) the maximum ( minimum ) of @xmath7 coincides with the minimum ( maximum ) of @xmath8 ; ( b ) the points above correspond to the zeroes of @xmath9 ; ( c ) the mid  range value of @xmath7 coincide with that of @xmath8 ; ( d ) the extremes @xmath45 coincide with the mid  range values in @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "-1 , 0 , 3 , 37 ( see section  [ sec : invar ] ) are drawn . ]",
    "intrinsic , frame  independent characteristics of the angular distribution are those linked to properties of the ellipses , and not depending on the position of the point as it moves along the loops when the reference frame is rotated about the @xmath10axis .",
    "an example of invariant is the specification of the plane that contains a set of ellipses , which we can write as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the invariant quantity discussed in reference @xcite , which we now interpret as the projection of the ellipses onto the plane @xmath14 .",
    "the invariance of ( [ eq : l_tilde ] ) means that it remains valid , for the same value of @xmath47 , if the coefficients are transformed as in ( [ eq : transf ] ) . in other words",
    ", @xmath48 is an invariant expression .",
    "other expressions invariant for changes of frame may be associated to the size of the axes , or to the ranges in @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "these invariants will involve all three coefficients of the angular distribution .",
    "an example is given by the differences @xmath49=(@xmath50 -@xmath51 , defined at the extremes of the ellipsis where @xmath52 , with @xmath53 specifying the side with positive or negative value .",
    "given any set of values @xmath43 , with @xmath54=@xmath7-@xmath8 , we find : @xmath55 the invariance of ( [ eq : delta+- ] ) corresponds to the invariance of the simpler expression : @xmath56 as an additional example , the invariant corresponding to the maximum range @xmath57 is related to @xmath49 through : @xmath58    we should keep in mind that a single invariant does not fully specify the intrinsic properties of the angular distribution . for example , all the ellipses contained in the same vertical planes in figure  [ fig : ellipses ] share the value of @xmath47 . in other words , sets @xmath43 providing the same value of @xmath47 are not necessarily linked by a rotation of frame about the _",
    "y_axis  while the reverse statement is true .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath59 is shared by ellipses with the same value of @xmath7-@xmath8 on the plane @xmath9=0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the combination of these two invariants identify entirely the intrinsic angular distribution . , the invariants may be interpreted in terms of properties of individual processes contributing to the angular distribution , defined in specific , process dependent frames . for @xmath59 , information on @xmath7-@xmath8 in the oriented frame is provided .",
    "the term @xmath8 describes asymmetries between @xmath26 and @xmath10 .",
    "for example , for @xmath7=1 , @xmath8 specifies the orientation of a polarization orthogonal to the @xmath6 axis , with longitudinal@xmath26 ( @xmath10 ) for @xmath8=@xmath60 ( + 1 ) , and with circular polarizations : @xmath61 for @xmath8=0 . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : cone ] shows that the largest allowed values of @xmath9 occurs for @xmath7=0 , @xmath8=0.5 , where @xmath62=1/@xmath63 , while it vanishes on the opposite sides of the allowed triangle : @xmath7=1 , @xmath8=0.5(1+@xmath7 ) .",
    "we can obtain the maximum allowed value @xmath62 compatible with given values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 with the following procedure : ( a )  define with ( [ eq : l_tilde ] ) the line corresponding to @xmath7 , @xmath8 and consider the segment reaching the sides of the triangle defined by ( [ eq : limit2 ] ) ; ( b )  use the transformation  ( [ eq : transf ] ) and compute the rotation angle that maps one end - point of the segment into a point with the given value @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) ; ( c )  using the same angle , @xmath62 is obtained through the corresponding rotation from the end - point .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in figure  [ fig : max ] .",
    "the result is the equation : @xmath64 ) , this expression completes the limits and the consistency relations among the coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "may be compared to the less constraining relation : @xmath65 0.5(1-@xmath8 ) for @xmath661/3 , @xmath67 for @xmath681/3 , from ref .",
    "these inequalities provide the envelope to the projection of ( [ eq : ltp - limit ] ) on the @xmath8 axis , _ i.e. _ : they are numerically equal if @xmath7 is chosen to maximize ( [ eq : ltp - limit ] ) locally . ] the allowed range of values is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cone ] .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ eq : ltp - limit ] ) specifies the geometry of the transformation of the coefficients . under a rotation of frame ,",
    "the variations of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are constrained by ( [ eq : l_tilde ] ) .",
    "if we substitute @xmath8 retaining @xmath7 as independent variable , the equation for @xmath62 can be written as : @xmath69this equation describes an ellipsis in the @xmath70 plane .",
    "since @xmath7 and @xmath8 are linearly related , a corresponding equation describes the loops in figure  [ fig : cone ] .",
    "a similar relation can be written for loops not reaching the maximum extension in @xmath7 or @xmath8 , proving that any transformation  ( [ eq : transf ] ) describes an ellipsis in the 3d space of the coefficients .     for given values of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "understanding the implications of the choice of reference frame is relevant for the study of of @xmath0 resonances decaying to lepton pairs , and we have provided a geometrical interpretation of the transformations of the coefficients of the angular distribution . for transverse momentum of the pair comparable or larger than its invariant mass , the rotation angle between the cs and the h frames may be comparable to @xmath71/2 over large ranges of rapidity , with corresponding large _ rotations _ in the @xmath72 space .",
    "indeed points close to the boundary @xmath7=1 ( @xmath9=0 ) may be mapped into those close to @xmath8=1/2(1+@xmath7 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "points near the vertex of the cone ( @xmath7=@xmath8=1 , @xmath9=0 ) or to the line @xmath7=@xmath8 , @xmath9=0 are scarcely changed by a different choice of reference frame .    besides the geometrical description ,",
    "our analysis has provided further insight on the subject of invariant quantities , and has specified in detail the range of allowed values for the coefficient @xmath9 .",
