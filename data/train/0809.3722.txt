    "accretion - powered millisecond pulsars ( amps ) provide a unique laboratory for studying the process of disk accretion onto magnetic stars ( @xcite and refrences therein ) .",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1  g stellar magnetic field truncates the accretion disk only a few neutron star radii above the surface , channeling the infalling matter toward the magnetic poles .",
    "the resulting x - ray  emitting hot spots and accretion shocks are modulated by the stellar rotation to produce the observed pulsations .",
    "such compact accretion geometry poses a particularly interesting challenge .",
    "we want to understand the details of the interaction between the magnetic field and the disk , and the effects that result from the proximity of different emitting regions .",
    "the accretion - powered 2.5  ms pulsar  is a particularly good system for this type of study : in addition to having multiple outbursts , it spans orders of magnitude in accretion rate . in this paper",
    "we report our study of the energy - dependence of pulsations from this source and show that it gives new insight into these problems .",
    "was the first detected amp @xcite , and it remains the best studied .",
    "persistent pulsations have been detected throughout the four @xmath01 month outbursts from this source that have been observed by the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) during 19982005 .",
    "the timing of these pulsations establishes a 2.01  hr binary orbital period @xcite that is increasing on a timescale of @xmath2  yr , possibly due to the ablation of its low - mass companion during x - ray quiescence ( @xcite , hereafter h08 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of x - ray pulsations during the peak accretion rate and the long - term spin - down of this source provide a tight constraint on its magnetic field : @xmath3@xmath4  g ( h08 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a distance of 3.43.6  kpc is estimated from thermonuclear x - ray burst properties @xcite .    the outbursts from  had similar light curves , which we divide for convenience into four stages ( see fig .  2 of h08  for a schematic ) : a rise from quiescence lasting @xmath55  days ; a short - lived peak at a 225  kev flux of @xmath6@xmath7  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 ; a 1015  day slow decay in luminosity that lasts until the source reaches @xmath5@xmath10  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 ; and finally a rapid fall in luminosity followed by weeks of low - luminosity flares with a @xmath05  d periodicity , during which the observed flux can vary by a factor of 1000 @xcite .",
    "this sudden drop has been interpreted as a transition into a `` propeller '' accretion regime ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in which accretion is only partially inhibited @xcite , although it may also be caused by a change in the viscosity of the accretion disk as it transitions into quiescence @xcite .    shortly after the discovery of pulsations in , @xcite noted the presence of soft phase lags , the tendency of the pulses at lower ( `` softer '' ) energies to arrive later than the corresponding pulses at higher ( `` harder '' ) energies .",
    "the magnitude of the lags increased approximately linearly between 210  kev and saturated at 0.08 rotational cycles ( 200  @xmath11s ) above 10  kev .",
    "similar soft lags have been detected in six other amps : igr  j00291@xmath125934 @xcite , xte  j0929@xmath13314 @xcite , xte  j1751@xmath13305 @xcite , xte  j1807@xmath13294 @xcite , xte  j1814@xmath13338 @xcite , and hete  j1900.1@xmath132455 @xcite .    a number of explanations for the amp soft lags have been proposed .",
    "models that include only doppler boosting , due to the stellar rotation @xcite or the orbiting material in the accretion disk @xcite , have shortcomings that are summarized by @xcite .",
    "the two most plausible explanations invoke a two - component emission model with differing angular dependence and spectra ( @xcite ; hereafter pg03 ) or the scattering delay of hot photons from the accretion shock off the cooler disk or stellar surface ( @xcite ; hereafter ft07 ) . in this paper",
    "we present an energy - resolved analysis of the persistent pulsations for all the outbursts of  detected by _",

    "negative offsets indicate soft lags .",
    "[ fig : avgpulsationsvsenergy],scaledwidth=45.0% ]        to assess the energy dependence of the pulse phase and fractional amplitudes , we calculated the average phase offsets and fractional amplitudes during the 11  d slow - decay stage of the 2002 outburst . figure  [ fig : avgpulsationsvsenergy ] shows the results , along with measurements from the 1998 outburst for comparison .",
    "we chose this time range because it was the longest and most data - rich interval during which the pulse profile of  was observed to be reasonably stable .",
    "the pulse profiles during the slow - decay stage of the 2005 outburst , although similar to the 2002 profiles , were somewhat less stable ( see fig .  3 of h08 ) .",
    "the soft phase lag of the pulsations is immediately apparent for the fundamental .",
    "between 2  kev and 10  kev , the pulses in harder bands arrive progressively sooner , with a slope of @xmath30  cycles  kev@xmath9 . between 10  kev and 20  kev",
    ", this trend saturates at a lead of 0.08  cycles ( 200  @xmath11s ) .",
    "there is impressive agreement between the 1998 and 2002 outbursts , which also had nearly identical light curves ; the phase lags during the dimmer 2005 outburst are similar in shape but plateau at a smaller magnitude .",
    "the phase offsets of the second harmonic are less pronounced , disappearing almost entirely or becoming hard lags when the source is bright , as is the case for the data in figure  [ fig : avgpulsationsvsenergy ] .    in contrast",
    ", the energy dependence of the fractional amplitudes varies considerably between outbursts .",
    "the fractional amplitude of the fundamental during the slow - decay stage of the 1998 outburst ( 5.27.5% rms ) was considerably higher than during the 2002 outburst ( 3.85.0% rms ) , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : avgpulsationsvsenergy ] ; the amplitude of the 2005 outburst ( 2.02.6% rms ) was lower still .",
    "the morphology of the energy dependence differs as well .",
    "the 1998 outburst exhibits a large fractional amplitude peak at 3.5  kev and falling amplitudes up to 20  kev , similar to what is seen in xte  j1814@xmath13338 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , during 2002 and 2005 the fractional amplitude vs. energy curves are much flatter , with small but significant peaks at 8  kev .",
    "given the strong similarities between the light curves of the 1998 and 2002 outbursts , it is curious that the energy dependence of their fractional amplitudes is markedly different .",
    "all three outbursts show weak evidence of the fundamental s fractional amplitude increasing again above @xmath520  kev .",
    "the fractional amplitude of the second harmonic generally increases with energy for all the outbursts , indicating less sinusoidal pulse profiles in harder energy bands .",
    "xmm observations of the 2008 outburst of this source reveal that the fractional amplitude of both harmonics continues to decrease below 2  kev @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bigenergyplot ] illustrates how the energy - dependent phases and fractional amplitudes change over the course of the four observed outbursts .",
    "the soft lags in the fundamental are apparent throughout all four outbursts ; for the second harmonic , soft lags are apparent everywhere except during the outburst peaks . however , the degree of these lags is not constant : they are much more pronounced during the tails of the outbursts , when the flux is low .",
    "@xcite noted a similar pattern in xte  j1814@xmath13338 , although that source did not trace as wide a range of fluxes , so the relationship was less clear .",
    "the energy dependence of the fractional amplitudes does not exhibit any clear correlation with the source flux or any other measured parameters , apart from the general trend of fractional amplitudes increasing in the outburst tails ( see  3.4 of h08 ) .    to further understand the relationship between the soft lags and the flux , we measured the phase vs. energy slopes over 210  kev .",
    "we chose this range because it has the most significant energy dependence for the fundamental and , to a lesser extent , for the second harmonic .",
    "figure  [ fig : phaselagslopevsflux ] plots the resulting slopes as a function of flux . for the fundamental , the magnitude of the soft lags is clearly anticorrelated with the 225 kev flux when the source is bright : as the source dims from its peak at @xmath31  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9  down to roughly @xmath10  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 , the magnitude of the soft lags grows .",
    "this range of fluxes covers the peak and slow - decay stages of the outburst . at lower fluxes ,",
    "the relation reverses , and the magnitude of the lags becomes correlated with flux .",
    "the flux at which this turnover occurs is significant : once it falls to @xmath10  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 , the source dims rapidly and enters the flaring - tail stage of the outbursts .",
    "erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9  turnover .",
    "these fits are based on the 2002 and 2005 data only , as the 1998 and 2000 outbursts exhibit greater scatter .",
    "[ fig : phaselagslopevsflux],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the trend for the second harmonic is somewhat less clear .",
    "measuring a slope through the 210  kev fractional amplitude points does not work as well since the energy dependence is less linear ( top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : avgpulsationsvsenergy ] ) , so there is more scatter .",
    "even so , the data strongly suggest a similar relationship at high fluxes , particularly when the relatively scattered 1998 data are excluded .",
    "the slopes of these trends differ significantly for the two harmonics . in the low - flux regime ,",
    "the slopes are @xmath32 for the fundamental and @xmath33 for the second harmonic ; at high fluxes , they are @xmath34 for the fundamental and @xmath35 for the harmonic .",
    "( the units in all cases are @xmath36  cycles  kev@xmath9  [ log  flux]@xmath9 . )",
    "these slopes were fit using the 2002 and 2005 data only , as the two earlier outbursts had appreciably more scatter and less data .",
    "note that these units reflect _ rotational _ cycles of the star , so a mechanism that induces the same phase lag in all photons of a given energy would result in the slopes being equal for the two harmonics .",
    "for the high - flux slopes , we can conclude with 8@xmath37 significance that this is not the case .",
    "we also looked for correlations between the lags and the spectral parameters from our blackbody plus power law fits .",
    "the only parameter for which a correlation is apparent is the normalization of the hard power law component .",
    "this relation is not surprising , because the hard normalization and the total x - ray flux are linearly proportional : during the 19982005 outbursts , @xmath38 , with a reduced @xmath39 near unity .",
    "the uncertainties of @xmath40 are much greater than the flux uncertainties , particularly when the source is dim , and the large scatter obscures whether a turnover is present in the lag vs. @xmath40 relation .",
    "the energy dependence of the pulsations from  exhibit strong variability both between and during the four outbursts observed by _",
    "rxte_. the overall fractional amplitudes and the shape of the amplitude vs. energy curves differ substantially between outbursts , with no obvious correlation with flux ; the only clear trend is that the pulsations generally become less sinusoidal with energy in the observed 230  kev range . in contrast , the soft lags of the pulses have a consistent energy dependence , increasing in magnitude in the 210  kev band and saturating at 1030  kev , with a strong dependence on flux . at the highest fluxes the lags are near zero , but they increase steadily as the flux falls . below a 225  kev flux of @xmath5@xmath41  erg  @xmath8  s@xmath9 , this trend reverses and lags get smaller again .",
    "this particular flux also marks the point in the outburst where the luminosity decays rapidly and the source enters the flaring tail .",
    "soft lags are a common feature of amp pulsations , and two plausible models have emerged to explain their existence .",
    "pg03 suggested a two - component model involving soft emission from a surface hot spot and a hard comptonized component from the shocked layer in the accretion funnel .",
    "each component has a different beaming pattern , which is affected in a different way by the doppler effect .",
    "this results in the soft pulse lagging the hard pulse .",
    "while this model works well for  and xte  j1751@xmath13305 @xcite , it does not predict the reduction in soft lags at very high energies seen in igr  j00291@xmath125934 @xcite . as a result ft07 proposed an alternative model in which the disk plays a prominent role . in this model",
    ", the main pulsed element is the hard component from the accretion column : this radiation is then downscattered by cold plasma in the inner disk ( or on the neutron star surface ) to generate a soft lagging component.300  ev in the inner disk @xcite ; the actual temperature will be higher due to the irradiation .",
    "at these temperatures and the expected electron densities ( @xmath42  @xmath43 ; see ft07 and fig .  [",
    "fig : falangafitvsmdot ] here ) , all elements through oxygen will easily be fully ionized by the hard tail of the thermal distribution .",
    "the only significant source of photoelectric absorption is fe , but for this @xmath44 only fe  xxv and higher remain at @xmath45  ev , with the transition to full ionization occuring at 400600  ev @xcite .",
    "its he - like and h - like forms have k edges at 9  kev , so they will not absorb the softer photons responsible for the lags . since the ft07 model is not ruled out _ a priori _ , this discussion attempts to address both models without preference . ]",
    "these soft lags get larger as the density of the scattering plasma falls .",
    "let us now explore the factors that might cause the flux dependence of the soft lags , assuming that flux directly traces accretion rate .",
    "we then need to ask how the properties of the system are expected to change as the accretion rate falls . for a star with a magnetic field that is strong enough to channel the accretion flow ,",
    "the reduction in accretion rate should cause an increase in inner disk radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this will have two relevant effects .",
    "first , the density of scattering plasma near the star will fall : within the model of ft07 this would cause the soft lags to increase .",
    "in addition the relative angular velocity of the inner disk and star will reduce .",
    "this will affect the angle at which the accretion funnel impacts the surface @xcite , changing the column density above any surface hot spot .",
    "this type of change might work within the model of pg03 to affect the soft lags .    if these changes continue steadily",
    ", however , it is hard to see what could cause the turnover seen in figure  [ fig : phaselagslopevsflux ] . one intriguing possibility that would give a very natural explanation for such a turnover is that the system reaches the point where the magnetospheric radius @xmath46 exceeds the corotation radius @xmath47 .",
    "this is often referred to as the `` propeller '' regime , since it was originally thought that matter would then be ejected from the system , with the star going from spin - up to spin - down @xcite .",
    "in fact , the transition is probably not sharp , and @xmath46 needs to be substantially larger than @xmath47 for ejection to occur @xcite . at intermediate accretion rates ,",
    "continued accretion is possible even while the neutron star starts to spin down @xcite .",
    "simulations by @xcite indicate that the transition between spin up and spin down should occur when @xmath48 for amps .",
    "the observed turnover happens at an accretion rate of @xmath49  yr@xmath9 , giving @xmath50 for the magnetic field @xmath51  g from h08 . , using @xmath52  kpc and the bolometric correction @xmath53 from @xcite .",
    "the alfvn radius was estimated as @xmath54 , with @xmath55 as per @xcite . @xmath56 and",
    "@xmath57  km were used in all cases . ]",
    "this close agreement between the simulations and the @xmath58 at which the flux rapidly drops and the soft lags turnover strongly suggests that  passes through this transition as the accretion rate falls . in this eventuality",
    "there are two effects that could cause the turnover in soft lags .     of the inner accretion disk , as fit using the model of ft07 , versus the mass accretion rate for the 2002 and 2005 outbursts of .",
    "the vertical dotted line marks the @xmath58 at which the magnitude of the soft lags is greatest and below which the outburst is in its flaring - tail stage ; a transition from normal accretion to the `` propeller '' regime can explain this change in the observed behavior .",
    "the dashed lines give the best fits of @xmath59 in each region .",
    "[ fig : falangafitvsmdot],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the first is due to the fact that the relative angular velocity of the inner disk and the star changes sign .",
    "the accretion funnel will go from being dragged forwards to being dragged backwards ( assuming that it settles rapidly ; @xcite ) .",
    "the column depth above any surface hot spot should therefore go through a maximum near the zero torque point , causing a turnover in the scattering properties of the accretion column .",
    "if the accretion column plays a major role as discussed in pg03 , this could cause the observed turnover .",
    "another explanation within the pg03 model is the suppression of the lagged soft component at high fluxes due to the increased optical depth of the accretion shock when @xmath58 is large .",
    "however , this mechanism would require the normalization of the soft component to decrease during the outburst peaks , contrary to what is seen ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 of @xcite ) .",
    "a second possibility stems from the fact that the properties of the disk must also change at this point . for accretion to continue after zero - torque point , the inner edge stops retreating , and",
    "the density at the inner edge must rise @xcite . in the scenario of ft07",
    ", this rise in inner disk density would cause the magnitude of the soft lags to decrease again . in the absence of compton upscattering , which would introduce hard lags",
    "not observed in , their model predicts that the scattering from the disk will modify the arrival times as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the thompson cross - section and @xmath44 is the electron density of the scattering region .",
    "this model provides reasonable fits to the observed phase lags ; figure  [ fig : falangafitvsmdot ] shows the resulting @xmath44 .    the fitted electron densities probe the relationship between the inner disk and the accretion rate . @xmath62",
    "@xmath43 gives a mean free path of @xmath63  km and time @xmath64  @xmath11s , requiring @xmath0100 scattering events to produce the observed soft lags .",
    "this @xmath65 rules out the thin neutron star atmosphere as a scattering medium .",
    "on the other hand , simulations by @xcite suggest an inner disk thickness of order the neutron star radius , and @xmath66 is more than adequate to accomodate the number of needed scattering events . from the fits in figure  [",
    "fig : falangafitvsmdot ] , we find that @xmath67 during the main outburst ; during the presumed propeller stage , @xmath68 . an interesting consequence of the former relationship is that at higher accretion rates before the turnover , when @xmath69 , the flow rate ( the volume of material per unit time crossing the inner edge of the disk ) must be constant : since @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the solid angle of the inner edge and @xmath72 is the radial velocity of material crossing it , the flow rate @xmath73 is fixed .",
    "if the phase lags in  are entirely due to compton downscattering , as suggested by ft07 , then this model must explain why the magnitudes of the soft lags for the second harmonic are roughly half the magnitudes for the fundamental over a wide range of @xmath58 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig : phaselagslopevsflux ] . following the formalism of @xcite , we model the timing effects of comptonization with a distribution @xmath74 of the photon escape times from the scattering medium . for the @xmath20th harmonic of the spin frequency @xmath75 ,",
    "we convolve the harmonic component @xmath76 with @xmath74 to find the new amplitude @xmath77 and the time lag @xmath78 of the scattered pulses : @xmath79 in general , the choice of @xmath74 accounts for the geometry of the emitting and scattering regions .",
    "however , for the large number ( @xmath0100 ) of scatterings previously noted , the geometry becomes unimportant and a photon diffusion distribution of @xmath80 is appropriate @xcite . applying this form to equation  ( [ eq : st80formalism ] ) ,",
    "the time lag of the @xmath81 harmonic is @xmath82 the diffusion timescale can not be longer than the lags themselves : @xmath83  @xmath11s .",
    "this sets a lower limit of @xmath84 due to scattering alone , contrary to the observation that @xmath85 .",
    "thus compton scattering can not by itself fully explain the observed lags : a change in the energy dependence of the initial pulses is still necessary .",
    "clearly , detailed calculations are required to check whether the two models really would predict the outcomes that we suggest , but they are at least in principle plausible",
    ". one would also need to test whether the models would predict any reversal in other pulsation properties at propeller onset , given that no such changes are observed .",
    "the interesting behavior of the soft lags in this source suggests that the lags of the other accretion - powered millisecond pulsars should be revisited to check for flux dependence .",
    "the only source for which this has been done is xte  j1814@xmath13338 : an increase in soft lags was observed in the tail of the outburst @xcite , but the rapid drop off and shorter tail of this source made it very difficult to study the pulsations at the lowest fluxes .",
