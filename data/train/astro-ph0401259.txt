    "astrophysicists continue to find excitement in studying  observationally and theoretically  stellar abundances of lithium .",
    "lithium abundances offer insights into a wide variety of problems , principally those related to the nucleosynthesis of lithium at an assortment of sites and to the astration of lithium by stars .",
    "the aim of our survey of lithium abundances in main sequence f - g stars was to document the astration of lithium including as a function of stellar mass , age , and metallicity .",
    "we do this by assembling lithium abundances for a sample of 451 f and g disk stars including 157 stars for which lithium abundances are presented for the first time .",
    "we compare and contrast the lithium abundances of these field stars with the abundances reported for similar stars in local open clusters .",
    "our sample complements the clusters in that it extends to lower metallicity .",
    "it is not our intent to confront the abundances with theoretical projections and predictions .    throughout the paper , we assume that the observed lii 6707  resonance doublet and the derived lithium abundance refer to the isotope @xmath4li with a negligible contribution from the isotope @xmath5li .",
    "there are two strong reasons for our assumption .",
    "first , all but one proposed mode of lithium synthesis makes @xmath4li with no or negligible coproduction of @xmath5li .",
    "coproduction of both li isotopes occurs in the interstellar medium between relativistic cosmic rays and ambient nuclei , as in collisions between protons and oxygen nuclei providing @xmath5li , @xmath4li as well as @xmath6be , @xmath7b , and @xmath8b as fragments of the @xmath9o nucleus .",
    "yields of @xmath5li and @xmath4li by this process may be assessed from measurements of @xmath6be abundances for which spallation reactions are considered to be the sole mode of synthesis .",
    "this assessment shows the @xmath5li abundance expected of disk main sequence stars to be negligible .",
    "second , astration of atmospheric lithium by mixing with the interior is driven by proton capture with a capture cross - section for @xmath5li that is about a factor of 80 larger than the cross - section for @xmath4li . thus , except in very special or contrived circumstances even mild loss of surface lithium by mixing and proton capture leads to complete astration of @xmath5li .",
    "note that not all proposed theories of the li - dip ( or general astration ) invoke destruction of surface lithium .",
    "theories ascribing the li - dip to a diffusion of li out of the atmosphere may predict an alteration of the isotopic ratio . even in these cases ,",
    "the lithium abundance is probably dominated by @xmath4li .",
    "our investigation is based on lithium abundances of 451 f and g nearby main sequence stars drawn from three surveys .",
    "table 1 provides the hd number and basic information for each star .",
    "the majority of the sample has evolved off the zero - age main sequence .",
    "this condition reflects the selection criteria used by the surveyors . for stars included in two or more of the surveys ,",
    "we have adopted a mean lithium abundance , and mean estimates for the important atmospheric parameters including the effective temperature and the metallicity .    with the exception of a few stars from chen et al.s ( 2001 ) sample , all of the stars belong to the local thin disk , i.e.",
    ", they move about the galactic centre in a roughly circular orbit at the sun s galactocentric distance .",
    "the galactic thick disk and halo are very poorly represented in the combined sample .",
    "thin disk stars of the same metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) have the same chemical composition to within a narrow range , i.e. , [ x / fe ] is the same for stars of the same [ fe / h ] , and [ x / fe ] changes only slightly with [ fe / h ] ( reddy et al .",
    "the three surveys excluded spectroscopic binaries where previously known or detected in the course of the survey , but a few surely remain undetected .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that table 1 includes tidally - locked binaries which may defeat the usual processes of astration of lithium .",
    "reddy et al . ( 2003 ) reported abundance analyses of 181 f and g stars based on high - resolution high signal - to - noise ratio optical spectra and model atmospheres .",
    "these field stars span the temperature range 5550 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath10 6500 k and metallicities @xmath120.80 @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath10 @xmath130.20 with an emphasis on the sub - solar metallicities .",
    "these stars , all belonging to the galactic thin disk , were largely chosen to lie off the zero - age main sequence in order that an evolutionary age could be determined .",
    "lithium was not among the 27 elements considered .",
    "for this paper , we extended the analysis to lithium using the 6707lii resonance doublet .",
    "selection of models and atmospheric parameters are discussed by reddy et al .",
    "basic atomic data for the 6707   doublet are taken from reddy et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . the lte li abundances were corrected for non - lte effects using carlsson et al.s ( 1994 ) recipe ; the corrections are small , attaining only 0.10 dex in the most extreme cases .",
    "lithium abundances obtained for 137 of the 181 stars and upper limits to the abundance for the other 44 stars are expected to be accurate to about @xmath140.1 dex with the uncertainty ( @xmath14 100 k ) in the effective temperature as a leading source of error .",
    "the @xmath140.1 dex is negligible with respect to the 2  dex or more depth of the li - dip , small with respect to the intrinsic scatter outside the dip , and much less than the apparent 1  dex growth of the lithium abundance from [ fe / h ] = @xmath121 to [ fe / h ] = 0 .",
    "chen et al . surveyed the lithium abundance in 185 main sequence stars sampling the interval 5600 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath10 6600 k and @xmath121.4 @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath10 + 0.2 . a major fraction",
    ", 133 of 185 stars , were drawn from an earlier paper : chen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) had given abundances for a mix of elements but not including lithium .",
    "the remaining fraction came from a reanalysis of stars analysed by lambert , heath & edvardsson ( 1991 ) . the survey s stars lie off the zero - age main sequence so that evolutionary ages may be estimated from stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "the method of abundance analysis chosen by chen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) resembles ours and included non - lte corrections from carlsson et al .",
    "reddy et al .",
    "( 2003 ) compare elemental abundances for stars in common with chen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and find very good agreement , also for the derived atmospheric parameters including the effective temperature and the metallicity .",
    "this agreement extends to the lithium abundances for 24 stars in common with chen et al .",
    "the mean difference in abundance ( us minus them ) is a mere 0.03@xmath140.04 dex . for four stars ,",
    "the difference in abundances is quite large , that is 0.2 to 0.6 dex , and traceable to differences in the equivalent width of the 6707  line . in particular ,",
    "the 0.6 dex difference arises for a star with a very weak lithium line . given this level of agreement",
    ", we merge the two samples without adjustments to the lithium abundances , the effective temperatures , and metallicities . for stars in common ,",
    "we adopt the average of the two lithium abundances , effective temperatures , and [ fe / h ] determinations .",
    "balachandran ( 1990 ) determined lithium abundances for nearly 200 field f stars .",
    "she sampled the temperature range 7000 @xmath15 @xmath16 k with most stars having metallicities in the range [ fe / h ] from @xmath120.6 to + 0.2 .",
    "in contrast to the preceding three samples which were restricted to sharp - lined stars , balachandran explicitly included broad - lined stars in order to investigate the effect of rotation on lithium surface depletions .",
    "her sample comprised stars on and off the zero age main sequence .",
    "four of balachandran s stars are in our sample",
    ". judged by these common stars , there is no significant difference in the lithium abundances from balachandran and ourselves : the mean difference ( us minus balachandran ) is -0.1@xmath140.06 dex",
    ". there are 10 stars that are common to chen et al . and balachandran . the mean differences ( chen minus balachandran ) in atmospheric parameters , and the li abundances are very small : @xmath17@xmath11 = @xmath1227 @xmath1476  k , @xmath17log @xmath18 = @xmath120.13@xmath140.08 , @xmath17[fe / h ] = 0.08@xmath140.08 , and @xmath17log @xmath19(li ) = @xmath120.04@xmath140.09 .",
    "these comparisons show no systematic differences either in atmospheric parameters or in li abundances between the three samples .",
    "thus , we have simply adopted balachandran results , after correction for the small non - lte effects .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      the maximum lithium abundance in each [ fe / h ] bin is taken to be the mean of the six highest lithium abundances in that bin .",
    "table 2 shows this abundance and the corresponding mean mass .",
    "selected stars are members of the thin disk . only in",
    "the lowest metallicity bin would thick disk stars be members of the richest sextet .",
    "the two thin disk stars in this bin have abundances of @xmath1(li ) = 2.40 and 1.96 for a mean of 2.18 , a value equivalent to the mean of 2.15 from the entire sextet .",
    "for the three bins which overlap the [ fe / h ] range of the clusters , the lithium abundances in table 2 are identical to the maximum abundances from the clusters . we identify this abundance with that of the interstellar gas from which the clusters and field stars formed .",
    "the lithium abundance seems to have increased by only about 0.2 dex as [ fe / h ] increased from @xmath120.35 to @xmath130.15 .    at metallicities [ fe / h ] @xmath20 , the maximum lithium abundance",
    "is provided by stars of about 1@xmath21 or less , a lower mass than provides the maximum abundance for more metal - rich stars .",
    "astration of lithium in the latter stars seems unlikely from figure 3 and the data on open clusters discussed above .",
    "but , the question arises : is the maximum lithium abundance for the [ fe / h ] @xmath20 bins reduced from the initial abundance by astration ?",
    "inspection of the data in the @xmath22 [ fe / h ] @xmath23 bin shows the lithium abundance falling steadily with decreasing mass .",
    "if a similar relation , as seems plausible , applies to the adjacent bin for @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath20 , the maximum abundance attributed in table 2 to the bin must be increased by about 0.5 dex , as indicated by the outlier at @xmath25 .",
    "then , the entry in table 2 for the bin would be @xmath1(li ) @xmath26 leading to the implication that the lithium abundance was constant as the thin disk s [ fe / h ] increased from @xmath120.5 to @xmath130.1 .",
    "if astration is ineffective in the contributing stars , the lithium abundances in table 2 map the evolution of lithium with [ fe / h ] .",
    "the orthodox consider that the floor to the tabulated data be set at the lithium abundance ( @xmath1(li ) @xmath27 ) of the spites plateau of the halo stars ( spite & spite 1982 ) .",
    "an allowance for astration , as suggested by figure 3 and the bins for [ fe / h ] @xmath28 , would seem to imply that the the lithium abundance has evolved little over the lifetime of the thin disk .",
    "then , how should one match a near uniform abundance of @xmath1(li ) @xmath26 for the thin disk to the halo abundance of @xmath1(li ) @xmath27 .",
    "perhaps , one should contemplate models in which the gas providing the earliest generations of thin disk stars enriched in lithium from sources other than the big bang .",
    "the unorthodox view of the spites plateau is that the big bang lithium abundance was greater than the present plateau ; lithium has been depleted over the life of the halo stars defining the plateau .",
    "this view encourages the speculation that the disk s lithium abundance may have evolved only slightly above the big bang value . in this connection",
    ", we note that a standard big bang model with the @xmath29 estimated from the cmb fluctuations and the cosmological d / h ratio implies a lithium abundance of @xmath1(li ) @xmath30 ( kirkman et al . 2003 ) , a value which would merge smoothly with the entries in table2 for the more metal - rich bins .",
    "this scenario supposes that lithium is astrated in the low mass metal - poor stars comprising the spites plateau and , by extension , also in the stars contributing to the entries for the lowest two bins in table 2 .    in the simplest of thin disk models ,",
    "one expects the lithium abundance to increase with time .",
    "the data for the individual stars contributing to table 2 hint at such an increase , but we suspect that the biases in the samples comprising the three surveys are largely responsible for the trend , also seen in [ fe / h ]  age trend .",
    "the abundance ratio li / fe is remarkably constant across the bins : @xmath1(li / fe ) = @xmath310.10 , @xmath320.11 , @xmath330.06 , @xmath340.06 , @xmath350.18 , @xmath360.16 , @xmath370.04 , and @xmath38 for the bins from the most iron rich to the most iron deficient .",
    "previously , the evolution of lithium with [ fe / h ] has been identified with the upper envelope of the points in a @xmath1(li ) versus [ fe / h ] plot ( see , for example , rebolo et al . 1988 ; lambert et al .",
    "1991 ) without specific consideration of the mass of the stars and the possible variation of the mean mass with [ fe / h ] and its implications for astration .",
    "our discussion based on figure 3 draws attention to this variation .",
    "if initial lithium abundance were coupled tightly to the [ fe / h ] of a star , astration at a fixed [ fe / h ] were only a function of a star s mass and were completed before evolution off the main sequence , the lithium abundances in each panel of figure 3 would be a smoothly varying function of mass with no scatter about the mean trend except for that attributable to errors of mneasurement .",
    "this is not the case , an observation noted previously by balachandran ( 1990 ) and chen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) from their samples of stars observed off the zero - age main sequence .",
    "we begin examination of the field stars with the 0.0 @xmath10 [ fe / h ] @xmath40 bin and the hyades stars .",
    "the comparison is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the solid line is a mean line through the hyades points taken from balachandran ( 1995 ) .",
    "the field stars at masses less than those of the li - dip trace the hyades mean line with few stars showing a lower lithium abundance .",
    "the low - mass limit ( red - edge ) of the hyades li - dip appears to mark the low - mass boundary of the large star - to - star scatter in figure 4 . our sample",
    ", however , contains few stars with @xmath41 .",
    "published surveys providing li abundances for such stars indicate that scatter in lithium abundances exists for such stars ( e.g. , pasquini , liu , & pallavicini 1994 , malik , parthasarathy , & pati 2003 ) .",
    "the field stars mapping the hyades relation are much older than the cluster : the mean age of the field sample on the low mass side of the li - dip is about 5 gy versus the cluster s age of 660 my . at face value , the similar lithium abundances of field and hyades stars of the same mass on the low mass side of the li - dip would seem to confirm the suggestion from cluster analyses that the rate of astration is very slow in stars older than about the hyades",
    ". there is , however , a systematic slight difference in the mean [ fe / h ] of the field stars and the hyades : [ fe / h ] for the field is about 0.07 dex less than that of the cluster .",
    "astration is predicted to be less severe in lower [ fe / h ] stars ( chaboyer et al . 1995 ) , and , hence , the field stars appear to have undergone more severe astration than the hyades , say by about 0.3 dex in about 4 gy .",
    "this suggestion is not inconsistent with the indications from comparisons of the hyades and older clusters .",
    "lithium abundances in field stars with masses greater than the value corresponding to the red edge of the li - dip show a range from a star s initial abundance ( @xmath1(li ) @xmath42 3.0 ) to the detection limit for these warm stars , a limit of @xmath1(li ) @xmath10 1.5 or even less .",
    "the fact that the lower mass limit for severe scatter in the field sample coincides with the red edge of the hyades li - dip is presumably not fortuitous but a reflection of a common cause .",
    "it is a well known observation ( kraft 1987 ) and one that motivated balachandran s selection of field stars that early - f stars include rapid rotators and the break in rotational speeds occurs at about the mass of stars belonging to the li - dip .",
    "we follow balachandran in supposing that loss of angular momentum ( ` braking ' ) has led to mixing and destruction of lithium .",
    "given an initial distribution in angular momenta , it is easy to imagine how a spread in surface lithium abundances results after braking .",
    "clearly , the hyades li - dip is not simply replicated by the field stars .",
    "field stars of normal lithium abundance occupy the mass range of the dip .",
    "li - poor field stars are found at masses higher than the central mass of the hyades dip .",
    "the filling in of the hyades dip by field stars may be due to errors in the assigned masses arising primarily from parallax and @xmath11 errors and the spread in the central mass of the dip resulting from its metallicity dependence and the 0.2 dex width in [ fe / h ] of the bin .",
    "young well - sampled clusters ( e.g. , @xmath43 per , and pleiades ) show neither the li - dip nor a spread in lithium abundances for stars with masses greater than the mass of the subsequent red - edge of the li - dip .",
    "clusters with a clear signature of the li - dip have very few stars more massive than those belonging to the li - dip , and generally few stars in the dip",
    ". even the hyades could be suspected of showing some scatter in lithium abundance in excess of observational errors for stars more massive than the mass of the centre of the dip .",
    "we venture to suggest that the large scatter shown by field stars is not contradicted by observations of open clusters .",
    "given that the field stars are older than the cluster main sequence stars of the same mass and that the timescale for development of lithium astration may be comparable to or longer than the main sequence lifetime , it is possible to understand the possibly smaller scatter of the lithium abundances among the cluster .",
    "our diagnosis of figure 4 seems to apply to the other bins ( figure 3 ) down to [ fe / h ] = @xmath44 with the proviso that the central mass of the li - dip moves to lower values with decreasing [ fe / h ] .",
    "there is a suspicion that the @xmath45 [ fe / h ] @xmath46 bin shows appreciable scatter in the lihium abundances among stars to the low mass side of the li - dip . at [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath47 , the distribution of the data points in figure 3 ( also figure 2 ) changes from one dominated by scatter to one in which a clear trend emerges with a few points lying on the low lithium side of the trend .        in young clusters such as the pleiades , a dependence of the lithium abundance on rotational velocity ( @xmath48 )",
    "is seen for stars of less than about 1@xmath21 with higher lithium abundance tied to faster rotation .",
    "this dependence is not seen in the more massive pleiades stars nor at all strongly in the low mass stars of very young clusters ( e.g. , @xmath43 per ) .",
    "also , the scatter in lithium versus mass relation is not seen among the low mass hyades stars .",
    "assuming that the pleiades - hyades difference is not a reflection of different initial conditions for the two clusters , it would seem that a different coupling of rotation and lithium operates at and below 1@xmath21 than at the higher masses .",
    "observations of the li - dip in open clusters show that over a narrow range in metallicity centred on the solar value that the mass at which the li - dip occurs decreases with decreasing [ fe / h ] ( balachandran 1995 ) .",
    "an alternative description of the result is that the li - dip occurs at a similar effective temperature on the zero - age main sequence , which may be a clue to the dip s origin .",
    "the [ fe / h ] dependence of the li - dip was anticipated from samples of field stars by balachandran ( 1990 ) and echoed by chen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the li - dip is traceable in the h - r diagrams and the panels of figure 3 .",
    "it is blurred on the high - mass side by scatter .",
    "an occasional lithium - poor star of low mass ( a solar analog ? ) is readily set aside .",
    "we estimate by inspection the mass of the li - dip by looking for the mass at which there is a concentration of li - poor stars and a relative paucity of stars with a normal lithium abundance .",
    "this exercise is impossible for the bin with @xmath49 [ fe / h ] @xmath50 and for bins with [ fe / h ] @xmath51 . with imagination , the mass is about 1.35@xmath21 , 1.25@xmath21 , 1.2@xmath21 , and 1.2@xmath21 for the five bins between [ fe / h ] = 0.0 and @xmath52 . in the bin for [ fe / h ] from @xmath52 to @xmath53 ,",
    "the low mass side of a dip seems traceable and @xmath21 @xmath54 is suggested .",
    "local clusters suggest that the mass of the dip decreases by about 0.05@xmath21 for a 0.1 dex decrease in [ fe / h ] ( balachandran 1995 ) .",
    "this is not inconsistent with the above estimates for the five bins whose centres span 0.35 dex .    a key open question remains : is the li - dip preserved as the stars age .",
    "data on clusters are too sparse to answer the question .",
    "preservation of the dip would suggest that lithium in li - dip stars is destroyed and not merely hidden below the surface .",
    "a signature of a preserved li - dip would be a string of li - poor stars along a track at a constant mass ( figure 1 and 2 ) .",
    "this is seen for the bin with @xmath24 [ fe / h ] @xmath20 , but , in the more metal - rich bins , li - poor and li - rich stars are commonly juxtaposed .",
    "this juxtaposition may have several origins and may not be in conflict with the idea that the li - dip is a permanent mark for a star until growth of the convective envelope dilutes the surface lithium abundance of all stars .",
    "errors in the lithium abundance determination , the estimate of @xmath55 , and the confusion arising from the hook in the evolutionary track , may all blur evidence for a li - dip confined to and a permanent feature of main sequence stars in a narrow mass range . yet",
    ", our assessment of these effects is that they may not fully account for the juxtaposition of li - normal and li - poor stars .",
    "we suspect that an additional mechanism is needed to account for the mixing of li - rich and li - poor stars ,    for [ fe / h ] @xmath56 , the distribution of the data in figure 3 ( also figure 2 ) changes from one dominated by scatter to one in which a clear trend emerges with a few stars on the low lithium side of the trend .",
    "a li - dip seems apparent for the bins with [ fe / h ] between @xmath120.3 and @xmath53 .",
    "an intriguing result from open clusters is the contrast between the dispersion of 1 dex or more in lithium abundances among low mass stars of the old cluster m 67 and the uniformity of the abundances in a similarly old cluster ngc 188 . in light of this , we comment on the scatter among the lithium abundances of the field stars on the low mass side of the li - dip .",
    "a m 67-like scatter for low mass stars is seen in the bin covering [ fe / h ] values from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , and in the @xmath59 to @xmath44 bin .",
    "pasquini ( 2000 ) speculates that the scatter for m 67 is of a bimodal nature but this is not evident from randich et al.s ( 2003 ) presentation of the results ( their figure 4 ) .",
    "a bimodality is not evident in the metal - rich bins in figure 3 . the scatter appears smaller in the two more metal - rich bins ( figure 3 ) , but we note that the number of stars in these two bins with a mass of about one solar mass is small .",
    "the scatter appears much reduced for the [ fe / h ] @xmath56 bins .",
    "it is intriguing that the scatter at low masses may be correlated with that among stars more massive than the mass of the li - dip .",
    "this hints at a common underlying origin for the scatter  a spread in angular momenta of main sequence stars which is large at high [ fe / h ] and reduced or absent in low [ fe / h ] stars ?",
    "our catalogue of field stars contains few stars with @xmath60 .",
    "pasquini et al .",
    "( 1994 ) find a m67-like scatter in this mass range from observations of field g stars .",
    "favata , micela , & sciortino s ( 1996 ) results for nearby g and k dwarfs may indicate a reduction of the scatter ( see their figure 1 ) at about @xmath61 and lower masses .",
    "these g and k field stars are likely very old .    to search for an age dependence for astration , we selected narrow well - sampled mass intervals and plotted the lithium abundance versus the age . in these samples ,",
    "almost all of the stars have evolved away from the zero - age main sequence .",
    "the spread in ages across the sample is small relative to the total main sequence lifetime .",
    "the lack of a dependence of lithium abundance on age is not , therefore , in conflict with the observed decrease of lithium with increasing age presented using the open clusters which span a larger age range than the field stars .",
    "unravelling the web of factors that control the surface lithium abundance of main sequence f and g stars has demanded extensive observations of lithium in stars in open clusters and the field .",
    "our principal goal in this paper has been to present the first measurements of the lithium abundances in nearly 200 f and g field stars , and to combine our results with those of two earlier surveys ( balachandran 1990 ; chen et al .",
    "2001 ) to provide a catalogue of lithium abundances for 451 f and g field stars .",
    "the field stars are presently residing in the immediate neighbourhood of the sun , and most were likely born at about the sun s galactocentric distance .",
    "distance and , hence , absolute magnitude @xmath55 are rather precisely known thanks to the _ hipparcos _ satellite .",
    "since the three contributing samples include stars somewhat off the zero - age main sequence , it is possible with the theoretical evolutionary tracks and the measurements of @xmath55 , @xmath11 , and [ fe / h ] to assign an evolutionary age to most stars . the sample of open clusters for which lithium abundances have been determined for f and g main sequence stars are also residents of the solar neighbourhood , albeit at a mean distance from the sun somewhat larger than the mean distance of the field stars .",
    "the environments in which field stars and open clusters are formed are unlikely to have differed greatly and one expects a field star and an identical cluster star to exhibit the same lithium abundance .",
    "lithium abundances of field and cluster stars share common aspects , and may point to some differences .",
    "one common aspect is that the inferred initial lithium abundance is the same over the age and metallicity range spanned by the open clusters .",
    "the initial or interstellar lithium abundance has been approximately constant in the solar neighbourhood for several gyr and over the [ fe / h ] range from about @xmath62 to @xmath59 .",
    "the growth of the lithium abundance from the spites plateau to the present level is presently definable only through observations of field stars .",
    "table 2 is our attempt to define that growth but it is based on the key assumption that the lithium of the defining stars is unaffected by astration . if the astration resembled that exhibited by the hyades and other clusters , the lithium of the thin disk may have had an approximately constant abundance as [ fe / h ] grew from @xmath2 to 0 .",
    "astration of lithium is not merely a function of a star s mass , age , and composition .",
    "this was evident long ago .",
    "the difference between the low lithium abundance of the sun and the much higher abundance exhibited by many field and cluster solar - like stars is one indication that other variables affect the surface lithium abundance .",
    "there is probably no convincing evidence yet that field and cluster stars of the same mass , age , and composition differ in their star - to - star variation of the lithium abundances , a variation attributed to astration rather than a spread in the initial lithium abundances .",
    "we have supposed that the scatter in lithium abundances among field stars with masses above the high - mass edge of the li - dip is due to differences in initial angular momentum and its loss ( rotational braking ) .",
    "an apparent absence of scatter in lithium abundance among such stars of open clusters may be due to the fact that few cluster stars in this mass range present themselves for analysis .",
    "it appears that the astration responsible for the star - to - star scatter occurs in main sequence not pre - main sequence stars .",
    "stars on the low mass side of the li - dip experience astration which develops at an early age , i.e. , it is evident in hyades and younger clusters .",
    "cluster and field stars show that additional astration beyond the age of the hyades is slight . at [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath63 , questions of lithium synthesis and astration must be answered from field stars ; few clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath63 are known . only one ( ngc 2243 ) has been examined for lithium ( hill & pasquini 2000 ) .",
    "the field stars suggest that the star - to - star variation in lithium abundance is much reduced at low metallicity with the exception of a few stars with an uncommonly low lithium abundance .    despite intensive observing campaigns on open clusters and field stars there remain gaps in our knowledge about lithium abundances in the ( mass , metallicity , age ) space , and rotation should be an additional one or two dimensions to this space",
    ". analyses of local field stars should be extended by making either more detailed studies of parts of the hr diagrams sampled by the three surveys used here or by extensions to new parts of the hr diagram , especially to lower masses .",
    "we have noted several times that the local open clusters span a narrow range in [ fe / h ] . to extend the work on clusters to lower [ fe / h ]",
    ", it will be necessary to seek distant clusters such as ngc 2243 in the anticentre direction ",
    "see , for example , the catalog of open clusters compiled by chen , hou , & wang ( 2003 ) .",
    "thorough scrutiny of a hyades - like cluster of [ fe / h ] @xmath64 @xmath65 or less would offer an empirical test of the variation of the mass dependence of astration with [ fe / h ] , a crucial test for establishing the growth of the lithium abundance in the local thin disk .",
    "the lack of metal - poor open clusters near the sun and belonging to the thin disk is presumably due to the evaporation and dissolution of clusters .",
    "nonetheless , survival of old solar metallicity clusters like m 67 and ngc 188 and the lack of ( say ) local [ fe / h ] @xmath66 clusters seems odd .",
    "certainly , these clusters appear to exclude a rapid recent increase in [ fe / h ] to present values .",
