    "here is an outline of the proof of theorem [ thm-3 ] .",
    "the proof uses polynomial partitioning .",
    "this technique was introduced by nets katz and the second author in @xcite , where it was applied to incidence geometry . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the second author applied this technique to restriction estimates in fourier analysis .",
    "polynomial partitioning is a divide and conquer technique .",
    "we begin by finding a polynomial whose zero set divides some object of interest into equal pieces . for instance , in @xcite , it was proven that for any finite volume set @xmath43 and any degree @xmath44 , there is a polynomial @xmath45 of degree at most @xmath46 so that @xmath47 is a union of @xmath48 disjoint open sets @xmath49 , and the volumes @xmath50 are all equal .",
    "hence for any @xmath51 , @xmath52 . in our paper , we choose the polynomial @xmath45 to behave well with respect to the @xmath53 norm of @xmath54 . for any @xmath55 and any degree @xmath44",

    "the degree @xmath46 will be a tiny power of @xmath59 , so @xmath46 is large compared to 1 , but very small compared to @xmath59 . )    breaking spacetime into cells @xmath49 is useful because of the way it interacts with the wave packet decomposition of @xmath54 , which we now recall .",
    "we decompose @xmath36 into pieces that are localized in both physical space and frequency space .",
    "we tile the physical space @xmath60 with @xmath61-cubes @xmath62 , and we tile the frequency space @xmath63 with @xmath64-cubes @xmath65",
    ". then we decompose @xmath36 as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is essentially supported on @xmath62 in physical space and essentially supported on @xmath65 in frequency space .",

    "the restriction of @xmath68 to the domain @xmath69 $ ] is essentially supported on a tube @xmath70 of radius @xmath61 and length @xmath59 .",
    "this tube intersects the time slice @xmath71 at @xmath62 , and the direction of the tube depends on @xmath65 .",
    "a key fact in the applications of polynomial partitioning in combinatorics is that a line can enter at most @xmath72 of the cells @xmath49 . to see this",
    ", we note that the polynomial @xmath45 can vanish at most @xmath46 times along a line , unless it vanishes on the whole line , and so a line can cross @xmath73 at most @xmath46 times . a wave packet @xmath68 is supported on a tube @xmath70 of radius @xmath61 .",
    "this tube can potentially enter many or even all the cells @xmath49 , but it can not penetrate deeply into very many cells .",
    "we define @xmath74 to be the @xmath61-neighborhood of @xmath73 in @xmath69 $ ] , and we define @xmath75 to be @xmath76 . now the central line of @xmath70 can enter at most @xmath77 of the original cells @xmath49 , and so the tube @xmath70 can enter at most @xmath77 of the smaller cells @xmath75 . in other words , each wave packet @xmath68 is essentially supported on the union of @xmath74 and @xmath77 cells @xmath75 .    we can use induction to study @xmath54 on each smaller cell @xmath75 . to study @xmath54 on a cell @xmath75 , we only need to take account of those wave packets that intersect @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , we define @xmath78 to be the sum of @xmath79 over those pairs @xmath80 for which @xmath70 enters @xmath75 .",
    "on the cell @xmath75 , @xmath54 is essentially equal to @xmath81 .",
    "we can control the @xmath82 norms of the @xmath78 by using the fact that @xmath79 are ( approximately ) orthogonal and the fact that each tube @xmath70 enters @xmath83 smaller cells @xmath75 .",

    "it remains to control the contribution coming from @xmath74 .",
    "the most difficult scenario is the following : the tubes @xmath70 are all contained in @xmath74 .",
    "the polynomial partitioning method allows us to reduce the original problem to this special scenario .",
    "this scenario indeed occurs in bourgain s example in @xcite .",
    "let us take a moment to describe this example .    in the example from @xcite , the zero set @xmath73",
    "can be taken to be a plane @xmath86 .",
    "the set @xmath74 is a planar slab of thickness @xmath61 . the solution @xmath54 is essentially supported in @xmath74 . on the plane @xmath86",

    "in other words , we can choose coordinates @xmath87 on this plane and an initial data @xmath88 so that @xmath89 is essentially equal to @xmath54 on the plane . also , @xmath90 is approximately constant as we vary @xmath91 within the slab @xmath74 .",
    "the initially data is chosen so that @xmath92 is large on a set @xmath93 of @xmath94 unit squares in @xmath95 \\times [ 0 , r]$ ] .",

    "moreoever , the projections of these rectangles are roughly disjoint , and so they cover a positive proportion of @xmath60 . therefore @xmath98 is large on a positive proportion of @xmath60 .    in this construction , the set @xmath93 needs to be fairly sparse because the projections of the @xmath97 rectangles need to be disjoint in @xmath60 . in particular",
    ", there can be at most @xmath61 unit squares of @xmath93 in any @xmath61-ball in @xmath95 \\times [ 0,r]$ ] .",

    "in rough terms , we need to show that a solution @xmath89 can not focus too much on a set @xmath93 which is sparse and spread out .",
    "we will prove such bounds using the @xmath101 decoupling theorem of bourgain and demeter @xcite .",
    "we think of these bounds as refinements of the strichartz inequality . here",
    "is one such estimate :    [ refstrichintro ] suppose that @xmath102 has frequency supported in @xmath103 .",

    "let @xmath109 denote @xmath110 .",

    "this theorem helps us to control the size of @xmath114 on a sparse , spread out set @xmath93 as above .",

    "here we state a slightly more complicated theorem which will imply all the theorems in the introduction .",
    "our proof uses induction , and we need the slightly more complicated formulation to make all the inductions work .",
    "first of all , the polynomial partitioning involves a topological argument , and the topological argument does not work well with the @xmath131 appearing in our maximal function .",
    "therefore , we replace the norm @xmath132 with the norm @xmath53 for @xmath57 very large . another technical issue has to do with parabolic rescaling .",

    "however , the change of coordinates in such a parabolic rescaling does not interact well with mixed norms of the form @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , we instead do induction on the size of the ball @xmath134 , proving slightly stronger bounds when the ball is small . taking account of these small issues ,",
    "we formulate our result in the following way :    [ thm-4 ] for @xmath135 , for any @xmath38 , there exists a constant @xmath39 such that for any @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) } \\leq c_{p , \\epsilon } m^{-\\epsilon^2}r^{\\epsilon } \\|f\\|_2\\ ] ] holds for all @xmath41 , any @xmath138 , any @xmath139 and all @xmath36 with @xmath140 .",
