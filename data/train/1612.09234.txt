    "<S> proof : one such state is given by @xmath88 it is desirable to sharpen eq .   to something like rhs of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> however , we are not aware of any sharper upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical study suggests that for a given @xmath1 , the state with max @xmath2 is generally a mixed one , unless we put restriction also on the dimension ( it s a pure state , if additionally @xmath89 + 2 $ ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , we have completely characterized the sharpest lower bound . </S>",
    "<S> the next result guarantees the minimum amount of distillable coherence from a resource state given only its dimension and @xmath1 ( or @xmath3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ prop : ultimate.bounds ] all states @xmath9 with a given @xmath90 satisfy @xmath91 \\text { and }    \\alpha=\\frac{1+b}{d}.      \\end{aligned}\\]]the same bound for @xmath29 holds for given fixed robustness @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> equality occurs for istropic - like states @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 being the maximally coherent state .    to prove it we rather maximize @xmath95 among states having @xmath96 , for a given @xmath97 and use @xmath98 @xcite . the full proof is provided in appendix  [ app : prop : ultimate.bounds ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also make a futile attempt to prove @xmath15 in appendix  [ app : failed.attempt ] , because it might be of independent interest .    _ * logarithmic coherence  a strong monotone which is not convex. * _ similar to logarithmic negativity @xmath99 @xcite , we can define @xmath100 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the addition by @xmath101 not only makes @xmath102 but also it allows the additivity under tensor products like @xmath2 , @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> the strong monotonicity follows easily from that of @xmath1 . if @xmath104s are probabilities and @xmath105 , the weighted arithmetic - geometric inequality reads @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath107^{p_i}&\\leq\\sum_ip_i\\left[1+c_{l_1}(\\rho_i)\\right]\\\\&=1+\\sum_i p_ic_{l_1}(\\rho_i)\\\\ & \\leq 1+c_{l_1}(\\rho),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last inequality is due to strong monotonicity of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath108 is a monotonically increasing function , applying @xmath109 both sides gives the strong monotonicity of @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> due to concavity of @xmath108 function , @xmath110 , however is not convex : @xmath111 iff @xmath112\\neq 0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the above arguments show that for any strong monotone @xmath113 , the logarithmic version @xmath114 is also a ( non - convex ) strong monotone , there is nothing special about @xmath1  except that in this case @xmath110 is additive under tensor products .    </S>",
    "<S> _ * relevence. * </S>",
    "<S> _ the main importance of this work is that it gives operational interpretations to @xmath1 in a completely quantitative way , namely it is similar to negativity in entanglement theory , and indeed the logarithmic coherence defined here , though not convex , is a better motivated one . </S>",
    "<S> the latter plays the exact role of logarithmic negativity in entanglement theory  giving tight upper - bound on distillable resource . </S>",
    "<S> once this is established , we can seamlessly browse all instances of usefulness of ( logarithmic ) negativity as an entanglement monotone from entanglement theory to coherence theory . </S>",
    "<S> for example , theorem  [ thm : gen.upper.mixed ] is just manifestation of known interrelations between relative entropy of entanglement , ( logarithmic ) negativity , and robustness of entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath1 , though arguably one of the simplest monotones which has apparently no role in entanglement theory , is significant for most relevant operational quantities in coherence theory . </S>",
    "<S> later we will mention relevance of our results beyond a particular resource theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we would also like to mention possible applications of our results to some related fields , namely information theory and matrix analysis . </S>",
    "<S> first note that @xmath45 is the rnyi entropy @xmath115=\\frac{\\alpha}{1-\\alpha}\\log_2\\big({\\lvert \\lambda \\rvert}_{\\alpha}\\big),\\ ] ] of order @xmath116 in disguise . </S>",
    "<S> thus the relation between @xmath32 and @xmath45 is actually optimizing @xmath117 subject to the given fixed value of @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is just a consequence of non - increasing property of @xmath119 . the optimization technique employed in appendix  [ app : proof : min . ] </S>",
    "<S> could also be applicable to other values of @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it s easy to find sharpest bounds on @xmath117 subjected to a fixed @xmath120 , which reproduce the same result from @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , finding trade - off relations between diagonals , eigenvalues , singular values etc . </S>",
    "<S> are classical problems in matrix analysis ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ch .  9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our main quest here was a small part , finding exact trade - off between diagonals and eigenvalues ( via entropy function ) , having the knowledge of sum of absolute values of the entries . </S>",
    "<S> one such independent relation is eq .   </S>",
    "<S> ( it s worth mentioning that the same matrix maximizes determinant @xcite , a log - concave function ) . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , our problem is exactly similar to finding sharpest fanne - audenaert bound @xcite for a single state and our results are independent of similar bounds @xcite .    _ * discussion and conclusion. * _ we have shown that in the coherence theory @xcite , @xmath1 operationally plays the exact role of negativity in entanglement theory . since there is no bound coherence @xcite ( a consequence of no bound entanglement in maximally correlated states ) , @xmath1 is intimately connected to any operationally relevant quantity or process . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the sharpest bounds on @xmath2 from theorem  [ thm : tightest.bounds.pure ] remains same even if we replace @xmath1 by @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our approach here retain the dogma that coherence theory is a subclass of entanglement theory for maximally correlated states . nonetheless , similar to entanglement theory </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that the requirement of convexity , although a desirable property , should be relaxed for coherence monotones .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth remarking that the relation @xmath121 does not hold for normalized quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized quantities , being dimension dependent , need not be monotone . </S>",
    "<S> also , @xmath2 and @xmath1 do not give the same ordering of state space . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there are states @xmath9 and @xmath74 such that @xmath122 .    before concluding we would like to mention that over the last two years many alternative frameworks of coherence theory have been proposed @xcite , stemming mainly from different notions of incoherent ( free ) operations . in some of these models </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath1 is not a monotone and arguably there is no maximally coherent state ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * table  ii ) , thereby lacking the interpretation of @xmath2 as distillable coherence </S>",
    "<S> . however , both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not only monotone , but also operational quantities even in the most general ( reversible ) resource theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of our results , as could also be seen as relations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are thus applicable to more general scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> pertinent to coherence , the most general framework by berg @xcite allows an interrelation analogous to eq .  , we have to replace @xmath1 by the sum of trace norm of all off - diagonal blocks @xcite .    _ * acknowledgments. * _ we thank tsuyoshi ando and fumio hiai for many helpful correspondences and nilanjana datta , alexander streltsov , and manabendra nath bera for inspiring discussions . sr and ml acknowledge financial support from the john templeton foundation , the eu grants osyris ( erc-2013-adg grant no . </S>",
