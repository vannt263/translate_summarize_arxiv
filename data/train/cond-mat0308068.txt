    "a stationary time series has statistical properties that do not change under time translation @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the time series that arise in a large number of phenomena in a broad range of areas  including physiologic systems , economic systems , vehicle traffic systems , and the internet @xcite  are nonstationary .",
    "thus nonstationarity is a property common to both natural and human - influenced phenomena .",
    "for this reason , the statistical characterization of the nonstationarities in real - world time series is an important topic in many fields of research and numerous methods of characterizing nonstationary time series have been proposed @xcite .",
    "one useful approach to quantifying a nonstationary time series is to view it as consisting of a number of time segments that are themselves stationary .",
    "the statistical properties of the segments ( i ) can help us better understand the overall nonstationarity of the time series and ( ii ) yield practical applications .",
    "for example , developing control algorithms for internet traffic will be easier if we understand the statistical properties of these stationary segments  a behavior that directly corresponds to the `` coarser flow rate '' of the current network traffic .    in general",
    ", it is impossible to obtain the exact segmentation of a nonstationary time series because of the complexity of the calculation .",
    "an exact segmentation algorithm requires a computation time that scales as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of points in the time series .",
    "hence , such an algorithm is not practical .",
    "for this reason , the segmentation of a real - world time series must accomplish a trade - off between the complexity of the calculation and the desired precision of the result .",
    "bernaola - galvn and co - workers recently proposed a heuristic segmentation algorithm @xcite designed to characterize the stationary durations of heart beat time series . in this algorithm @xcite ,",
    "the calculation cost is reduced by iteratively attempting to segment the time series into only _ two _ segments . a decision to cut the times series",
    "is made by evaluating a modified student s",
    "@xmath5-test for the data in the two segments .",
    "the application of this segmentation algorithm reveals that the distribution of the stationary durations in heart beat time series decays as a power law @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , a recent analysis of internet traffic uncovered that the distribution of stationary durations in the fluctuation of the traffic flow density also follows a power law dependence @xcite .",
    "because these signals have their origin in such diverse contexts , these findings suggest that the power law decay of the distribution of the stationary period may be a common occurrence for complex time series .",
    "thus , the correct implementation and interpretation of the results obtained by the segmentation algorithm is essential in understanding the dynamics of the system .",
    "in fact , there are many implementation issues concerning the segmentation algorithm of ref .",
    "@xcite that have not yet been addressed explicitly in the literature , especially those concerning the proper estimation of the value of the power - law tail s exponent in the cumulative distribution of stationary durations .    in this paper",
    "we systematically analyze different types of surrogate time series to determine the scope of validity of the segmentation algorithm of bernaola - galvn and co - workers @xcite . in section",
    "ii , we briefly explain the segmentation algorithm . in section iii",
    ", we present results for the dependence of the exponent of the power law tail on the minimum size of the segments in the distribution of the stationary durations . in section iv",
    ", we consider the effect of the amplitude of the noise and the presence of spike - type noise . in section",
    "v we consider long - ranged temporally - correlated noise .",
    "finally , in section vi , we summarize our findings .",
    "to divide a nonstationary time series into stationary segments @xcite , we move a sliding pointer from left to right along the time series and , at each position of the pointer , compute the mean of the subset of the signal to the left of the pointer @xmath6 and to the right @xmath7 . for two samples of gaussian",
    "distributed random numbers , the statistical significance of the difference between the means of the two samples , @xmath8 and @xmath8 , is given by the student s @xmath5-test statistic @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pooled variance @xcite , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the standard deviations of the two samples , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number of points in the two samples .    moving the pointer along our time series from left to right , we calculate @xmath5 as a function of the position in the time series .",
    "we use the statistic @xmath5 to quantify the difference between the means of the left - side and right - side time series .",
    "larger @xmath5 means that the values of the mean of both time series are more likely to be significantly different , making point @xmath15 , with the largest value of @xmath5 , a good candidate as a cut point .",
    "we then calculate the statistical significance @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is not the standard student s @xmath5-test because we are not comparing independent samples .",
    "@xmath16 is numerically approximated as @xmath17}\\times ( \\delta\\nu , \\delta)\\}^{\\gamma},\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are obtained from monte carlo simulations @xcite , @xmath4 is the size of the time series to be split , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the incomplete beta function .    if the difference in mean is not statistically significant  i.e .",
    ", if is smaller than a threshold ( typically set to 0.95)then the time series is not cut .",
    "if the difference in means between the left and right part of the time series is statistically significant , then the time series is cut into two segments as long as the means of the two new segments are significantly different from the means of the adjacent segments .",
    "if the time series is cut , we continue iterating the above procedure recursively on each segment until the obtained significance value is smaller than the threshold , or the size of the obtained segments is smaller than a minimum size @xmath22 .",
    "we will see that the value of @xmath22 is one of the parameters controlling the accuracy of the algorithm .      to investigate the validity of the algorithm",
    ", we analyze surrogate time series @xmath23 generated by linking segments with different means .",
    "as described in section  i , the cumulative distribution of the stationary durations for some real - world time series is characterized by a power law decay in the tail , so the probability of finding a segment of size larger than @xmath24 , i.e. , the cumulative distribution of segment sizes in our time series , is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the minimum size of a segment .",

    ", we estimate @xmath74 for @xmath77 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath78 , @xmath79 only for @xmath80 .",
    "when @xmath47 increases , the segmentation algorithm is unable to cut the segments because the greater amplitude of the fluctuations inside a segment decreases the significance of the differences between regions of the time series .",
    "this effect yields very large segments , which results in very small estimates of @xmath61 .",
    "this effect is even stronger for @xmath71 , for which we find @xmath74 only for @xmath81 .",
    "next we analyze the effect of spike noise on the performance of the segmentation algorithm .",

    "the effect of this procedure is illustrated in fig.[fig : raw - pulse ] for four distinct values of @xmath82 .",
    "the figure also suggests that the segmentation algorithm yields a good coarse - grained description of the surrogate time series for @xmath82 as large as 0.1 .",
    "this result suggests that the algorithm is robust to the existence of uncorrelated spike noise in the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "in this section , we investigate the effect of long - range correlations in the fluctuations around the segment s mean on the performance of the segmentation algorithm .",
    "this study is particularly important because real - world time series often display long - range power law decaying correlations .",
    "we generate a temporally - correlated noise whose power spectrum decays as @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "the surrogate time series consists of 60,000 points , with mean 0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : seg_corr_onesegment ] displays the cumulative distribution of segment lengths .",
    "the curves show the different noise correlations : @xmath85 , 0.5 , and 1.0 ( @xmath86 ) .",

    ", we still observe a longer segment , although the curves decay rapidly for large @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the segmentation algorithm divides a correlated noise for large @xmath88 into many small pieces of stationary segments , because the given time series is already nonstationary for this case . also , it is hard to determine the functional form of the plots for all cases .",

    "it is hard for all the curves to determine the functional form ; a power law or an exponential distribution .",
    "there exists only one long segment for @xmath91 .",
    "then , for larger @xmath88 , the segmentation algorithm splits the time series into many smaller pieces of stationary segments .",
    "this is because that the time series with larger @xmath88 has a higher probability that a part of the time series is nonstationary .",
    "however , a quantitative relationship between @xmath61 and @xmath88 is not clear for all the case of the correlated noise with no segments . ]      here , in order to show the ability of the identification of segments , we analyze surrogate time series concatenating segments with long - range correlated random variables whose power spectrum is followed by a power law with an exponent @xmath88 .",
    "we show in figs .",

    "the figure suggests that the segmentation algorithm can correctly parse the short segments but that long segments get cut multiple times , especially for @xmath89 .",
    "this result is to be expected because the strong correlations in the noise lead to marked changes in the mean .    in figs .",

    "the data confirm quantitatively the visual impression gained from figs .",
    "[ fig : betaraw](a)-(c ) , i.e. , that longer segments get cut multiple times . in particular , for @xmath89 , the distributions clearly deviate from the power law , independent of the selection of @xmath22 .",
    "however , this fact should not be seen as a shortcoming of the algorithm ; for large @xmath88 , correlated noise for a long segment is already nonstationary , so that the algorithm is indeed cutting a nonstationary signal into stationary durations .",
    "in this paper we analyzed nonstationary surrogate time series with different statistical properties in order to investigate the validity of the segmentation algorithm of bernaola - galvn and co - workers @xcite .",
    "our results demonstrate that this heuristic segmentation algorithm can be extremely effective in determining the stationary regions in a time series provided that a few conditions are fulfilled : first , one must have enough data points in the time series to yield a large number of segment lengths , otherwise one will not be able to reach the aymptotic regime of the tail of the distribution of segment sizes .",
    "second , the ratio of the amplitude of the fluctuations within a segment to the typical jump between the means of the stationary segments must be relatively small ( less than about @xmath95 ) in order for one to trust the output of the segmentation algorithm .",
    "this concern contrast with the case of spike noise in the data which affects the performance of the segmentation algorithm only weakly .",
    "finally , if there are long - range temporal correlations of the fluctuations around the mean of the segment , then the segmentation algorithm correctly cuts the time series into the stationary segments for small @xmath88 .",
    "however , for @xmath96 , the fluctuations inside long segments become nonstationary , which results in the algorithm detecting many `` stationary '' durations inside these long segments .",
    "our analysis provides a number of clear guidelines for using effectively the segmentation algorithm of bernaola - galvn _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite :    1 .",
    "one must perform the segmentation for a number of different values of @xmath22 in order to identify the region for which the tails of the distributions of segment sizes reach the asymptotic scaling behavior .",

    "one must calculate the ratio between the standard deviation of the mean value of the segment and the standard deviation of the fluctuations within a segment after performing the segmentation . if the @xmath47 than 0.6 , then there is the possibility that @xmath61 is considerably under - estimating the true value of @xmath48 .",
