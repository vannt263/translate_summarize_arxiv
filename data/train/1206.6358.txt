    "debris disks are the last stage of circumstellar disk evolution , in which the gas from the protoplanetary and transitional disk phases has been dissipated and the dust seen comes from collisions between planetesimals . in the youngest debris disks , @xmath1 myrs old , terrestrial planets may still be forming @xcite .",
    "giant planets must form before the gas dissipates ; their gravitational interactions with planetesimals and dust can leave signatures in debris disks .",

    "these dust grains are believed to be produced through the collisions of the larger planetesimals , and therefore are likely to have similar compositions to the larger undetected bodies .",
    "the properties and locations of the dust grains in kuiper belt analogs can provide clues to the properties of the hidden planetesimals .",
    "additionally , dust structures in the disk may point to unseen exoplanets ( e.g.  @xmath2 pic b ; * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite added unresolved ground based mid - ir photometry from timmi2 , visir , michelle and trecs and found a blackbody temperature of 265 k with a radius of 4 au .",

    ", we found a lower blackbody temperature of 208 k. this is still highest temperature of all the disks in the sample , implying the grains are either very close to the star , or smaller than 1@xmath0 m in size .",
    "but hd3003 is an a0 star , and has a blowout size of 3.4@xmath0 m .",
    "therefore , the temperature is likely due to the distance from the star .",

    "the goodness - of - fit is very small for hd3003 , with @xmath14 , despite reproducing the pacs data quite well .",

    "the disk was not detected with _ spitzer _ at 70 and 160@xmath0",

    "the best - fitting model in @xcite was very dependent on the mips 70@xmath0 m upper limit .",
    "with the pacs 70@xmath0 m detection , the disk radius is better constrained .",
    "we fit the disk with a surface density profile of @xmath21 , a minimum grain size at the blowout limit , and a @xcite grain size distribution , similar to the modeling done by @xcite .",
    "but , in contrast to @xcite , we found an inner radius of @xmath22 au .",
    "this difference is due mainly to our measured disk flux at @xmath23 m that @xcite did not have .",

    "@xcite found a minimum radius of 7.2 au .",
    "our physical disk model fit gave an inner radius of 7.8 au , consistent with previous results .",
    "the hd30051 disk was first discovered in this survey .",
    "unfortunately , the disk system was never observed with _",
    "spitzer _ , and very little mid - ir data are available to constrain the disk parameters . with only two data points showing ir excess , we were unable to model the disk in any more detail than a blackbody model .",
    "but the best - fitting blackbody temperature of 58 k indicates the main component of the disk is far from the star .",
    "keeping the assumption of large pure blackbody grains , the disk would be centered around @xmath24 au .",
    "this is a lower limit on the disk radius because smaller silicate grains would have a temperature of 58 k tens of au farther out .",
    "one disk in our sample , hd105 , is marginally resolved at 70@xmath0 m in the _ herschel _ pacs images .",
    "hd105 is the brightest disk in our sample",
    ". it may not be the most extended , but for the other disks an extended structure would fall below the background noise .",
    "we determined that the hd105 disk was resolved in two ways .",
    "the first was to compare the azimuthally averaged radial profile of the disk to a reference star , arcturus .",
    "figure [ fig : radprof ] ( a ) shows the azimuthally averaged radial profiles of the two images .",
    "these profiles were calculated by measuring the mean flux within annuli of one arcsecond width around the star .",
    "scan maps with a smaller pixel scale of @xmath25 pixel@xmath26 were created for this purpose .",
    "the uncertainties in the measurements were determined by calculating the standard deviation in the flux within each annulus .",
    "this method leads to an overestimation of the errors because the pacs psf changes radially across each annulus due to its tri - lobed shape .",
    "the azimuthally averaged radial profile of hd105 shown in figure [ fig : radprof ] ( a ) is extended beyond the psf with a fwhm of @xmath27 compared to the psf fwhm of @xmath28 .",
    "the error in the fwhm is determined from the uncertainties in the brightness by calculating the distance away from the fwhm where the brightness profile plus and minus the errors would be equal to half the maximum brightness .",
    "this is not a strong detection of extended structure given the large ( and overestimated ) errors .",
    "therefore , we also used a second method to determine if the disk is resolved .",
    "the second method tries to avoid problems with the pacs psf tri - lobe shape by averaging over brightness contours rather than annuli .",
    "figure [ fig : contours ] shows the pacs 70@xmath0 m images of hd105 and the reference star arcturus scaled to the same peak brightness with brightness contours overlaid .",
    "the fluxes in the regions between the contours were averaged and the uncertainty measured from the standard deviation .",
    "the contours used for figure [ fig : radprof ] ( b ) are 15 , 30 , 50 , 70 , 85 , and 100% of the peak brightness for hd105 and arcturus . for arcturus , which is brighter than hd105 ,",
    "the 1 , 2 , 5 , and 10% contours are also used .",
    "the radius adopted for each mean flux value was the mean distance of the region between the contours .",
    "this method is unable to map the brightness profile of hd105 far from the star because it quickly falls below the background .",
    "but it it clear from figure [ fig : radprof ] ( b ) that the disk is extended with a fwhm of @xmath29 beyond the psf that has a fwhm of @xmath30 .",
    "the pacs psf size is given by the _",
    "pacs icc as a two - dimensional gaussian with fwhm of @xmath31 .",
    "the fwhm reported here for hd105 was not calculated in the same way .",
    "therefore , the fwhm values should not be directly compared to the pacs psf fwhm when determining the physical size of the disk .",
    "the fwhm values are given only to show that the disk is indeed significantly extended beyond the psf .",
    "in section 5.2 , we determine the physical size of the disk without using the fwhm .      without data at wavelengths",
    "longer than 160@xmath0 m , the outer radius can not be determined from sed fitting alone .",
    "however , resolved imaging provides geometrical information .",
    "the marginally resolved image of hd105 constrains the outer radius of the disk .    to determine the outer radius of the disk",
    ", we produced a synthetic image of the disk using the parameters from the best fitting sed model .",
    "we then convolved our model with the pacs psfand rotated it to the position angle of the observation for direct comparison .",
    "we varied the outer radius and determined the @xmath11 value between the model and the images of hd105 .",
    "once the outer radius of the model is greater than a certain value , the surface brightness at that radius is so low that it falls below the noise level .",
    "therefore , we can only place a lower limit on the outer radius of the disk .",
    "we found a disk outer radius of @xmath32 au .",
    "there are , of course , several assumptions that go into this model .",
    "the first is that the ring is circular and face - on .",
    "the second is that the dust surface density distribution follows an r@xmath33 profile .",
    "this is expected to be the case for collisionally dominated disks .",
    "several resolved images of disks have shown more complicated structure such as rings with sharper density profiles , clumps , warps , and other asymmetries .",
    "these structures would have less of an effect on the sed , which is fairly insensitive to the density profile , but would strongly affect the analysis of the _ herschel _ images .",
    "the outer radius derived here is the first such constraint put on the disk , but an image with higher spatial resolution is needed to better determine the spatial extent .",
    "we detected ir - excesses in @xmath34 of the stars in our sample .",
    "the tucana - horologium disks we detect all have some similarities .",
    "they are optically thin debris disks with relatively low fractional luminosities compared with younger protoplanetary disks , which have typical fractional luminosities of l@xmath35/l@xmath36 @xcite . as of yet , none of the tucana - horologium systems have shown any significant amount of gas .",
    "however , these disks do show a remarkable amount of variety for systems of the same age ( @xmath37 myrs ) .",
    "the single temperature blackbody fits give a range in temperature of 50 - 208 k. although the hottest disk is around an a0 star ( hd3003 ) , the other six disks still display a temperature range of 50 - 146 k with no apparent dependence on spectral type .",
    "any trends that may exist would be hard to see in a such a small sample .",
    "our further modeling also shows a variety in other disk properties .",
    "three of these properties , minimum grain size , the grain size distribution power - law , and inner holes , will be discussed in the following sections .      the minimum grain size in debris disks is expected to be approximately equal to the blowout size due to radiation pressure .",
    "any grains smaller than this limit would be ejected from the system on a timescale of a few thousand years .",
    "but there are a few problems with using the blowout size as a limit .",
    "first , there are many assumptions that go into the blowout size calculation .",
    "the grains are assumed to be spherical , have a constant density , and start out on circular orbits . additionally , the grain composition must be assumed . as circumstellar grain composition is hard to determine due to the lack of mid - ir solid state features from most debris disks , ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ism grain composition is commonly used . but densities can differ greatly between silicates , graphite and ices , all of which are expected to be present in debris disks .",
    "porosity may also play a role in changing this grain size limit @xcite . for these reasons , it is difficult to interpret the minimum grain size results based on the blowout size .    only two disks in our sample had well constrained minimum grain sizes . for hd105 ,",
    "the minimum grain size found was more than an order or magnitude greater than the blowout size . here , either the calculated blowout size is inaccurate , pointing to a different grain composition or porosity , or larger grains are efficiently removed by some other mechanism .",
    "@xcite show that dynamically cold disks have fewer small grains .",
    "the smaller velocity of the collisions decreases the production rate of the small grains while the destruction rate increases .",
    "this produces a disk dominated by larger grains with orbits mostly confined to the planetesimal ring , very similar to what is observed around hd105 . for hd3003 ,",
    "the minimum grain size is similar to the blowout size .",
    "the range of temperatures seen in the blackbody fits imply inner gaps with radii from 4.5 to 52 au .",
    "the largest inner hole is in the hd105 disk .",
    "giant planets could be responsible for these holes . however , there are also viable mechanisms to explain the holes without planets @xcite .",
    "for instance , dust parent bodies may preferentially form at outer locations .",
    "this can be expected as a result of photoevaporative clearing of the inner gas disk and pile - up of dust at its inner edge ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or as a consequence of rapid planetesimal formation in spiral arms of a self - gravitating disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "resolved imaging showing the sharpness of the hole s edge could put more constraints on the processes that created the inner hole , as was done in the case of the fomalhaut debris ring @xcite .",
    "the disk of hd3003 was found to have a grain size distribution much steeper than the typical @xcite steady state collisional cascade .",
    "a steeper distribution implies two possibilities : the disk has an overabundance of small grains , or a paucity of large grains . the minimum grain size we find for hd3003 ( @xmath38 m ) is large enough that we suspect the explanation to be the paucity of large grains .",
    "we believe the minimum grain size to be correct , as it is consistent with both the blowout size and the lack of a @xmath39 m silicate feature in the irs spectrum which is only seen in disks with small ( sub-@xmath40 m ) grains @xcite .",
    "we investigated other explanations of the sed slope .",
    "the lack of flux at longer wavelengths could mean a smaller outer radius than was assumed .",
    "the disk could be tidally truncated by its binary companion if the other star were close enough to the disk .",
    "we tried fixing the grain size distribution power - law index to @xmath41 and varying @xmath42 from 15 - 120 au .",
    "these models were not able to reproduce the observed data .    the unusual behavior of the hd3003 sed has been seen in older debris disks in the dunes sample @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected three debris disks with _",
    "herschel _ whose slopes are also inconsistent with a @xcite distribution .",
    "they give three possible explanations for the underabundance of large grains .",
    "first , there is a departure from the steady state collisional cascade conditions .",
    "hd3003 is a denser disk , so it should be collision dominated not transport dominated .",
    "however , the distribution can still deviate from @xcite by processes such as radiation pressure that causes a wavy distribution that is steeper at some points @xcite .",
    "the second possibility is that grains of a different composition would have a different absorption coefficient , @xmath43 , which may affect the sed slope . and lastly , a sheparding planet could result in a spatial separation of the small and large grains , leaving the large grains undetectable .",
    "an idea not proposed in @xcite , but possibly relevant here , is enhanced stirring of the planetesimal disk by the companion star .",
    "the true separation of hd3003 s companion star is unknown .",
    "if it is close enough , it could violently stir the disk .",
    "if the orbit of the binary is eccentric , then a close passage of the companion would excite the disk , raising the mean eccentricity of the disk particles , and thereby increasing their relative velocities @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations show that the waviness of the grain size distribution depends on the collision velocities . the amplitude and the peak - to - peak wavelength of ripples in the grain size distribution increase with higher velocities @xcite .",
    "larger ripples mean the size distribution will be steeper for grain sizes above the blowout limit , as is seen in hd3003 .",
    "however , the strange behavior of the sed is not yet understood , and will require more data and further modeling to determine its cause .",
    "we observed seventeen stars in the tucana - horologium association with the pacs instrument on the _ herschel space observatory_. we detected six debris disks , including one previously unknown disk and put sensitive upper limits on those not detected .",
    "we modeled the disks with a thermal dust disk model and were able to place tighter constraints on several disk parameters , such as the inner disk radius , minimum grain size , and grain size distribution .",
    "additionally , we marginally resolved one disk and were able to put a lower limit on the outer radius .",
    "future work will include _ herschel _ spire observations to better populate the sub - mm portion of the seds , and resolved imaging with alma to break degeneracies by determining the disk geometry .",
    "these data will also be combined with other targets of different ages to examine the statistical properties of the entire gasps sample .",
    "this work is based on observations made with herschel , a european space agency cornerstone mission with significant participation by nasa .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through an award issued by jpl / caltech .",

    "<S> the model is determined by a set of six parameters : surface density index , grain size distribution index , minimum and maximum grain sizes , and the inner and outer radii of the disk . </S>",
    "<S> the best fitting parameters give us constraints on the geometry of the dust in these systems , as well as lower limits to the total dust masses . </S>",
