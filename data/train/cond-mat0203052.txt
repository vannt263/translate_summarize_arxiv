    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of trapped alkali atoms have internal degrees of freedom due to the hyperfine spin of the atoms .",
    "when a bec is trapped in a magnetic potential , these degrees of freedom are frozen and the state of the bec is described at a mean - field level by a scalar order parameter . when a bec is trapped in an optical potential , however , the spin degrees of freedom are liberated , giving rise to a rich variety of phenomena such as spin domains  @xcite and textures  @xcite . here",

    "the physics common to both cases is that the spin - singlet state is isotropic and therefore each magnetic sublevel shares the equal population .",

    "it is now understood  @xcite that the validity of mfts is quickly restored with increasing an applied magnetic field .",
    "thus for the many - body spin correlations to manifest themselves , the external magnetic field have to be very low .",

    "the bose - einstein statistics leads to a constructive interference among permuted terms , giving rise to a highly nonlinear magnetic response to be discussed later .",

    "the spectrum includes two massless modes ( [ dis2 ] ) due to the global gauge invariance and the rotational symmetry about the spin quantization axis .",
