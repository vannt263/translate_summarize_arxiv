    "due to the incredible increase in computing power provided by the computer industry over the last decade or so it has become possible to attempt to model , by 3-d numerical simulations , the formation and evolution of galaxies using various combinations of gravitational and hydrodynamical codes ( e.g. evrard 1988 , hernquist & katz 1989 , hk89 in the following ) . since the physical problem involves very large density contrasts fully lagrangian codes , like tree - sph ( hk89 ) which is completely particle based , are particularly well suited for this problem .",
    "the tree - sph code calculates gravitational interactions using a hierarchical tree method ( barnes & hut 1986 ) and the hydrodynamical interactions using the sph ( smoothed particle hydrodynamics ) method ( lucy 1977 ; gingold & monaghan 1977 ) .",
    "primarily to suppress effects of two - body gravitational interactions in such simulations the gravitational field of a gas or dark matter particles is softened , typically by using a plummer softening kernel ( evrard 1988 ) or a spline softening kernel ( hk89 ) - see section 2 for more details about gravitational softening .    in the passive variant of such simulations ( i.e. simulations not involving energy and momentum feedback to the interstellar medium due to supernova explosions , stellar winds , uv radiation from ob stars etc . )",
    "it is generally found that several small , massive gas clumps ( @xmath7 for simulations of milky way sized galaxies ) are formed quite early in the simulations and survive for several gyrs .",
    "the high density gas is nearly isothermal with a temperature @xmath8 .",
    "this is due to the form of the radiative cooling function used in the simulations .",
    "the primordial gas cools quite effectively at temperatures @xmath9 , mainly through collisional excitation of h and @xmath10 by free electrons , but the cooling function is effectively truncated below @xmath11 where the density of free electrons rapidly tends to zero as the gas recombines . for low gas densities the radiative cooling can be suppressed , at the relevant temperatures @xmath12 , by up to two orders of magnitude by inclusion of effects of a background , ionizing , uvx radiation field , but at the high densities characteristic of the small , massive gas clumps the cooling function is essentially unchanged ( efstathiou 1992 , vedel , hellsten & sommer - larsen 1994 , vhsl94 in the following ) .    at first glance",
    "it seems somewhat surprising that such small , massive , isothermal gas clumps can be in quasi - equilibrium at a temperature of @xmath11 , since for newtonian gravity the mass inside of @xmath13 of a stationary , isothermal , self - gravitating gas sphere is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath1 the temperature , @xmath16 is the mean molecular weight , @xmath17 is the proton mass , @xmath18 is the gravitational constant , @xmath19 is the temperature in units of @xmath20 , @xmath21 the mean molecular weight in units of 1.2 and @xmath13 is in units of @xmath22 in the last expression .",
    "note , though , that , as shown by ebert ( 1955 ) and bonner ( 1956 ) , the newtonian isothermal sphere is only stable for @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the central density , @xmath25 is given by equation ( 13 ) and @xmath26 is the central number density of hydrogen in units of @xmath27 .",
    "the dense , massive gas clumps are generally supported by rotation to some extent , but it is obviously of relevance to investigate whether such dense , massive gas clumps could be in equilibrium even in the absence of any rotational support at all , as a consequence of the gravitational softening . in the following",
    "it will be demonstrated that indeed they can .    in section 2 gravitational softening",
    "is briefly discussed . in section 3 pressure equilibrium solutions for isothermal",
    ", self - gravitating gas spheres will be derived for softened gravity . in section 4",
    "the theoretical predictions will be discussed in relation to the results of numerical tree - sph simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "section 5 constitutes the conclusion and finally in appendix a the softened gravitational potential and gravitational field of an infinitely thin , spherical shell is determined .",
    "one popular way of incorporating gravitational softening in numerical , particle based simulations is to replace the newtonian potential , @xmath28 , of a point mass of mass @xmath29 with the spherically symmetric plummer potential @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the plummer scale - parameter . from poissons equation",
    "it follows that the point mass is smeared out into a density distribution of total mass @xmath29 @xmath32 which is called the plummer sphere - see e.g. binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) .",
    "note that , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 everywhere .",
    "this is to some extent a disadvantage , at least if the gravitational interactions are calculated with a tree code - see the discussion in hk89 .",
    "hk89 proposed , inspired by the work of gingold & monaghan ( 1977 ) , to soften the gravitational field of a point mass by using the same spline kernel as was used in their implementation of sph .",
    "this spherically symmetric spline ( softening ) kernel , originally introduced by monaghan & lattanzio ( 1985 ) , has the advantage that it has compact support at @xmath35 , where the scale - parameter @xmath0 is denoted the softening length .",
    "the point mass of mass @xmath29 is hence smeared out into a density distribution of total mass @xmath29 @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "note that @xmath38 for @xmath39 , so outside of @xmath35 the gravitational field and potential are exactly the same as for newtonian gravity .    in our tree - sph simulations we use the hk89 spline softening for the reasons given above .",
    "we shall consequently adopt this type of gravitational softening in the following theoretical considerations also .",
    "we shall restrict the following analysis to spherically symmetric systems only :    the force equation for a stationary , isothermal , self - gravitating sphere gives @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gas velocity , @xmath42 the gas pressure , @xmath43 the gas density and @xmath44 the gravitational potential .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume that the hydrodynamics are described by the equations of ordinary gas physics .    in sph the gas density ( and effectively also all other hydrodynamical variables like gas pressure , energy , entropy etc .",
    ") is estimated on the basis of a smoothing kernel , which , for example , can be of the form given in equation ( 4 ) - see e.g. hk89 and references therein for further details .",
    "the characteristic smoothing scale is denoted the smoothing length @xmath45 . when comparing the theoretical models , developed in the following , with the small , massive , quasi - isothermal gas clumps , formed in our tree - sph simulations , we assume , in this paper , that the theoretical predictions are directly applicable . this assumption is valid here , since @xmath45 is always much smaller than the characteristic size of clumps .",
    "one should note , though , that this assumption will not always be valid .",
    "assuming an ideal gas equation of state @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the gas number density , equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) yield for newtonian gravity @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a constant , since t in the following is assumed to be constant , and where @xmath50 is the adiabatic index , @xmath51 the sound speed and @xmath52    in equation ( 7 ) we use newton s first and second theorems , that the gravitational acceleration @xmath53 depends only on the _ amount _ of mass _ inside _ of @xmath13 .    in the case of softened gravity",
    "the situation is very different : for a given softening length @xmath0 the softened gravitational acceleration @xmath54 depends on the _ density distribution _",
    "@xmath55 for @xmath56 $ ] , so in particular also on the density distribution out to two softening lengths _ outside _ of @xmath13 .",
    "as will be shown in the following , the change of the structure of isothermal spheres for softened gravity relative to the newtonian case is , in general , quite dramatic .    for newtonian gravity",
    "all solutions to equation ( 7 ) can be rescaled such that equation ( 7 ) effectively has one and only one solution in terms of the normalized density and radius @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 and where @xmath60 usually is denoted the king radius ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1987 ) .    in the case of softened gravity",
    "the gravitational field depends on one more parameter than for newtonian gravity : @xmath0 , the softening length .",
    "one would consequently expect that all solutions to the force equation ( 7 ) can be rescaled in terms of a _ one - parameter family _ of solutions and , as we show in the following , this indeed is the case .",
    "let @xmath61 be given and let @xmath62 be a solution to @xmath63 where @xmath64 and where @xmath65 is the softened gravitational acceleration at @xmath13 due to a unit mass , infinitely thin , spherical shell located at @xmath66 . in appendix",
    "a an expression for @xmath65 is derived .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath67 where @xmath68 using this it is easy to show that , for parameters @xmath69 , @xmath70 is a solution to equation ( 14 ) . in other words",
    "if we know all solutions to equation ( 14 ) for a given softening length @xmath0 , then all solutions , for _ any _ softening length @xmath71 , can be obtained by a mere scaling .",
    "now , let again @xmath61 be given and let @xmath62 be a solution to equation ( 14 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 is a solution to equation ( 14 ) .",
    "again , if we know all solutions to equation ( 14 ) for a given value of @xmath74 , then all solutions for _ any _ @xmath75 can be obtained by a mere scaling .",
    "consequently , in general , the solutions to equation ( 14 ) can be expressed as a one - parameter family in terms of a normalized density @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78      fig .",
    "1 shows the softened gravitational field , @xmath79 , for shells located at @xmath80 and 1.00 , where @xmath81 = @xmath82 . for @xmath83 , the gravitational acceleration at @xmath84 due to such",
    "a shell is approximately linear in @xmath13 : @xmath85 where it follows from the appendix of hk89 that the constant @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 equation ( 14 ) can then be solved analytically assuming that the scale of the system is less than or comparable to @xmath88 : @xmath89 where @xmath90 if , at @xmath91 , @xmath92 , then from the consistency relation for the total mass @xmath93 it follows that @xmath94 @xmath95 can then be obtained as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number density of hydrogen in units of @xmath27 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the softening length in units of 3 kpc .    from equations ( 24 ) , ( 26 ) and ( 29 ) it follows that @xmath100 we now introduce the characteristic length scale @xmath101 : @xmath102 equation ( 25 ) can then be rewritten as @xmath103 or as @xmath104 where @xmath105 . hence the density distribution is gaussian in @xmath13 with dispersion @xmath106 .",
    "so for @xmath107 all solutions can be rescaled in terms of one and only one solution , as is the case for the newtonian isothermal sphere , though the nature of the two solutions is very different .",
    "it is sometimes claimed that the size of the small scale , self - gravitating gas structures formed in dissipative tree - sph simulations is simply of the order the gravitational softening length . from equation ( 31 )",
    "it follows that , in general , this is _ not _ correct .      from fig .",
    "1 it can be seen that , for a given softening length @xmath0 and a shell of mass @xmath29 located at @xmath108 , a point mass of mass @xmath29 at @xmath109 results in a softened gravitational field , which is a quite good approximation to softened gravitational field of the shell and for @xmath110 is a significantly better approximation , than the linear approximation discussed in the previous section .    rewriting equation ( 14 ) as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the specific potential corresponding to the softened gravitational field of a point mass of unit mass , it follows by integration of equation ( 34 ) that @xmath113 can be expressed as @xmath114 in the appendix of hk89 @xmath115",
    "is expressed as @xmath116 the function @xmath117 is also given as equation ( a3 ) in appendix a of this paper .",
    "equation ( 34 ) can hence be rewritten as @xmath118 the consistency equation for the total mass can not be used in this case , since it can be shown that @xmath119 however , by setting @xmath120 in equation ( 37 ) , one obtains , for systems characterized by @xmath121 , a generally much better approximation to the true solution than for the linear approximation - see the following subsection .      a numerical",
    ", iterative algorithm was developed to obtain exact solutions of equation ( 14 ) .",
    "the general solutions can conveniently be expressed as @xmath122 where @xmath37 and @xmath123    in fig .",
    "2 the solutions are shown , as functions of @xmath124 , for a large range of the @xmath125 parameter . as @xmath126 the solutions , as functions of @xmath124 , converge towards a vertical line at @xmath13 = 0 and as @xmath127 the solutions , as functions of @xmath124 , converge towards a horizontal line at @xmath128 = 1 .",
    "as @xmath126 , then @xmath101 becomes the characteristic linear scale of the isothermal spheres and the solutions converge as @xmath129    conversely , as @xmath127 @xmath25 becomes the characteristic linear scale of the isothermal spheres and the solutions converge as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and there is a one - to - one relation between @xmath132 and @xmath125 : @xmath133    in fig.3 @xmath134 is shown , as function of @xmath135 , for various values of @xmath125 and , as expected , @xmath136 as @xmath126 .    in fig.4 @xmath137",
    "is shown , as function of @xmath138 , for various values of @xmath125 and , likewise as expected , @xmath139 as @xmath127 .    in fig .",
    "5 @xmath140 is shown , as a function of @xmath135 , for various values of @xmath125 and , as can be seen from the figure , @xmath141 as @xmath126 - as expected - and it is obvious that the point mass approximation , in general , is much better than the linear approximation ( fig .",
    "3 ) , as discussed in subsection 3.3 .    fig . 6 shows @xmath142 as a function of @xmath37 for various values of @xmath125 . as can be seen from the figure , @xmath143 for @xmath144 whereas for larger values of @xmath125",
    ", @xmath95 becomes increasingly larger than @xmath145 and increases steadily with @xmath124 .",
    "this behaviour is expected , since for @xmath146 the linear approximation breaks down and for the point mass approximation , for the general solution and for the newtonian isothermal sphere it can be shown that @xmath147 as @xmath148 .",
    "shows , for @xmath0 = 3 kpc , a typical value used in current tree - sph simulations of galaxy formation , and @xmath149 = 1 , the density profiles of the general solution for log(@xmath26 ) = -2 , -1 , .... , 6 . similarly fig .",
    "8 shows , for the same parameters , @xmath150 in units of @xmath151 .",
    "as can be seen , the masses are in general much larger , at @xmath152 1 kpc , which is the typical size of the massive , cold gas clumps formed in our passive simulations , than would be expected on the basis of isothermal sphere solutions for newtonian gravity - see equation ( 1 ) .    as a corollary it follows from equations ( 29 ) and ( 31 ) that , for given physical parameters @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 as @xmath156 .",
    "so we obtain the perhaps somewhat surprising result that for _ any _ @xmath157 and _ any _ positive value of @xmath149 - like @xmath158 for typical small , massive , cold clumps formed in tree - sph simulations of passive galaxy formation - it is possible to deposit an arbitrarily large mass of gas in pressure equilibrium and with a non - singular density distribution inside of @xmath2 , for _ any _ @xmath3 ( neglecting effects of changes in the equation of state as well as general relativistic effects ) .",
    "to compare the theoretical predictions obtained in the previous section with what is actually found in numerical tree - sph simulations of passive galaxy formation , we performed a series of simulations , starting from vacuum boundary , top - hat initial conditions , similar to those described in vhsl94 .",
    "these simulations are not very realistic with regards to galaxy formation , but this is of no consequence for the present purpose .",
    "we carried out four simulations .",
    "the first three only differed by having @xmath159 = 1.5 , 3.0 and 6.0 kpc respectively .",
    "the fourth was a higher resolution simulation - it was identical to the second simulation except that 8 times more gas particles ( each with one eighth of the original gas particle mass ) were used ( but note that _ no _ extra phases were added to the initial conditions ) .",
    "the purpose of this simulation was to check whether the hydrodynamical resolution was sufficient in our simulations .",
    "other details about the simulations are given in table 1 .    in each of the four simulations we selected the three most massive , cold gas clumps ( @xmath160 at time @xmath161 gyr .",
    "at this time all the cold gas clumps were self - gravitating .",
    "they typically form at @xmath162 gyr in mini dark matter halos , but the dark matter is stripped off during the violent relaxation phase at first recollapse of the proto - galaxy at @xmath163 gyr .",
    "all the cold gas clumps had , at @xmath161 gyr , a radial extent of less than or order @xmath0 . the cumulative mass distribution , at @xmath161 gyr , for the largest , cold gas clump in simulations # 1 - 3 , is shown in fig .",
    "9 and the cumulative mass distribution , at @xmath161 gyr , for simulations # 2 and # 4 ( low versus high hydrodynamical resolution ) , is shown in fig .",
    "10 for all three clumps .    for each cold gas clump we measured the mass @xmath164 and the central density @xmath26 and determined the mass @xmath165 , which would be expected for an isothermal sphere of this central density and parameters @xmath99 and @xmath149 as in the simulations ( all gas clumps were in the @xmath166 regime ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath167 for the individual clumps is plotted in fig .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , @xmath167 is generally well below unity , indicating that effects of rotational support , which are not included in our theoretical models , is of importance .",
    "for all the clumps @xmath167 is observed to increase as @xmath0 increases .",
    "this is to be expected since , for clumps of similar mass and specific angular momentum , the ratio @xmath168 of pressure force to total gravitational force scales approximately as @xmath169 when @xmath168 is well below unity and @xmath166 .",
    "furthermore , as the clump masses decrease , @xmath167 is observed to increase for a given @xmath0 .",
    "this is also to be expected , though on rather more complicated grounds : theoretically one would expect that the average dimensionless spin - parameter @xmath170 depends only weakly on the magnitude of the initial density fluctuations later collapsing and forming the mini dark matter halos in which the gas clumps subsequently form dissipatively ( e.g. barnes & efstathiou 1987 ) .",
    "if one furthermore assumes that the mass of a gas clump depends on the circular speed @xmath171 of its mini dark matter halo like @xmath172 , from e.g. the tully - fisher relation , then one can show that , for a given softening length , @xmath168 scales approximately as @xmath173 for @xmath168 well below unity and @xmath166 .    for the smallest clump in simulations # 1 - 4 the effect of pressure forces appears to be comparable to the effect of rotational support .",
    "in fact , for softened gravity , the relationship between the physical structure of self - gravitating , rotationally supported systems and the gravitational softening length @xmath0 is quite similar to what is found in this paper for isothermal spheres , as shown in sommer - larsen , vedel & hellsten ( 1997 ) .    finally a note on hydrodynamical resolution in tree - sph simulations : from figs . 10 and 11",
    "it seems - comparing simulations # 2 and # 4 - that the hydrodynamical resolution is sufficient . at later times ,",
    "when the clumps have merged and super - sonic , radiative shocks have occurred , the results of simulations # 2 and # 4 are still very similar - as an example the surface density in the resulting gas disks , at @xmath174 gyr , is shown in fig .",
    "12 for simulations # 2 and # 4 .",
    "this is quite reassuring , because , whereas in nonradiative shocks the density contrast always is less than the rankine - hugoniot limit of @xmath175 , where @xmath50 is the adiabatic index , significantly larger density contrasts most probably occur in the radiative shocks and this could potentially cause spurious effects , because of effects of limited shock resolution due to the smoothing , inherent in sph .",
    "we propose that one should always test a sph simulation in the manner described above for simulations # 2 and # 4 .",
    "such a simple test constitutes a necessary ( but not , in general , sufficient ) condition that the hydrodynamical resolution is sufficiently high to adequately resolve super - sonic , radiative shocks .",
    "we have developed a theory for the structure of isothermal , self - gravitating gas spheres in pressure equilibrium for softened gravity , based on the spline softening kernel proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) .    because the gravitational force depends on an extra scale - parameter ,",
    "the softening length @xmath0 , relative to newtonian gravity , the solutions constitute a one - parameter family , rather than the one and only one isothermal sphere solution for newtonian gravity .    for softened gravity",
    "the structure of isothermal spheres is , in general , very different from the newtonian , isothermal sphere .    for example",
    "we find , as a corollary , the perhaps somewhat surprising result , that , for _ any _ finite softening length @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 , it is possible to deposit an arbitrarily large mass of gas , in pressure equilibrium and with a non - singular density distribution , inside of @xmath2 , for _ any _ @xmath3 ( neglecting effects of changes in the equation of state and general relativistic effects ) .",
    "furthermore , it is sometimes claimed that the size of the small scale , self - gravitating gas structures formed in dissipative tree - sph simulations is simply of the order the gravitational softening length .",
    "we demonstrate , that this , in general , is _ not _ correct .",
    "the main purpose of the paper is to compare the theoretical predictions of our models with the properties of the small , massive , quasi - isothermal gas clumps formed in numerical tree - sph simulations of passive galaxy formation of milky way sized galaxies ( i.e. simulations not involving energy and momentum feedback to the gas from supernova explosions , stellar winds , uv radiation from ob stars etc . ) .",
    "we find reasonable agreement , despite the neglect of effects of rotational support in our theoretical models .",
    "we would expect that if the gravitational softening was based on a plummer kernel ( which is also a one scale - parameter type of softening ) , rather than the spline kernel , the resulting isothermal spheres would be qualitatively similar to those described in this paper .",
    "we encourage any plummer softening fan to check this quantitatively by going through a similar exercise as described in this paper for the spline softening .",
    "we have not discussed the stability of the isothermal sphere equilibrium solutions obtained in this work - we shall return to this issue in a forthcoming paper using an approach similar to that outlined by ebert ( 1955 ) and bonner ( 1956 ) .",
    "we comment on whether the hydrodynamical resolution is sufficient in our numerical simulations of galaxy formation involving highly super - sonic , radiative shocks and we give a necessary condition , in the form of a simple test , that the hydrodynamical resolution in any such simulations is sufficient .",
    "the results obtained in this paper , and in sommer - larsen , vedel & hellsten ( 1997 ) , seem to indicate that one should be cautious when comparing what is observed in the real universe with results of numerical tree - sph simulations or any other numerical , gravitational - hydrodynamical simulations , where the calculation of the gravitational interactions , locally or globally , is particle based and the gravitational field of the individual particles is softened .    to summarize : without proper testing / understanding of the effects of gravitational softening and hydrodynamical smoothing in numerical gravitational - hydrodynamical simulations of various physical problems , the degree of reality represented by such simulations may be quite difficult to assess .",

    "<S> a theory for the structure of isothermal , self - gravitating gas spheres in pressure equilibrium is developed for softened gravity , assuming an ideal gas equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> the one - parameter spline softening proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) is used . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the addition of this extra scale - parameter implies that the set of equilibrium solutions constitute a one - parameter family , rather than the one and only one isothermal sphere solution for newtonian +   + _ submitted to the astrophysical journal _ +   + gravity .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop a number of approximate , analytical or semi - analytical solutions which apply in various regions of parameter space .    for softened gravity , </S>",
    "<S> the structure of isothermal spheres is , in general , very different from the newtonian isothermal sphere . </S>",
    "<S> for example , as a corollary , we demonstrate the perhaps somewhat surprising result that even in the complete absence of rotational support it is possible , for _ any _ finite choice of softening length @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 , to deposit an arbitrarily large mass of gas in pressure equilibrium and with a non - singular density distribution inside of @xmath2 for _ any _ @xmath3 ( neglecting effects of changes in the equation of state as well as general relativistic effects ) .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is sometimes claimed that the size of the small scale , self - gravitating gas structures formed in dissipative tree - sph simulations is simply of the order the gravitational softening length . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate , that this , in general , is _ not _ correct .    </S>",
    "<S> the main purpose of the paper is to compare the theoretical predictions of our models with the properties of the small , massive , quasi - isothermal gas clumps ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) which form in numerical tree - sph simulations of passive galaxy formation of milky way sized galaxies ( i.e. simulations not involving energy and momentum feedback to the gas from supernova explosions , stellar winds , uv radiation from ob stars etc . ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find reasonable agreement , despite the neglect of effects of rotational support in the models presented in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we comment on whether the hydrodynamical resolution is sufficient in our numerical simulations of galaxy formation involving highly super - sonic , radiative shocks and we give a necessary condition , in the form of a simple test , that the hydrodynamical resolution in any such simulations is sufficient .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we conclude that one should be cautious , when comparing results of numerical simulations , involving gravitational softening and hydrodynamical smoothing , with reality . </S>"
