    "stratospheric ozone in the southern hemisphere high latitudes has decreased dramatically since the early 1970s .",
    "this long - term trend has been attributed to a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors  @xcite . in particular , it has been discovered that the ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere of the southern hemisphere is particularly pronounced , due in part to a strong barrier to meridional transport between middle and high latitudes during the austral winter and early spring  @xcite .",
    "barriers such as these , which often coexist with turbulent mixing , play a major role in the dynamics of the stratosphere .",
    "the polar vortex is a known strong barrier to transport , enclosing a persistent , non - dispersive , coherent region over the high latitudes .",
    "our aim in this letter is to precisely determine the spatial location and movements of this coherent region , improving significantly over existing methods of estimation .",
    "our study focuses on the upper stratosphere where the polar vortex is best developed .",
    "it is common meteorological practice to diagnose the polar vortex edge at the position of maximum meridional gradient of potential vorticity ( pv ) .",
    "potential vorticity is a quantity combining measures of circulation and stratification which is materially conserved for adiabatic , inviscid flow ( both of which are good approximations in stratospheric flow over timescales of a week or two ) .",
    "it can be shown that strong pv gradients produce a `` restoring force '' inhibiting meridional motion of air parcels  @xcite . nevertheless , pv gradients alone provide only indirect measures of mixing barriers .",
    "in contrast , the present study characterises regions of minimal mixing directly in terms of the transport properties of the observed stratospheric flow .",
    "we present an innovative new mathematical technique to determine the polar vortex location at different times , directly as coherent structures in observed velocity fields .",
    "lagrangian pv - based measures of the vortex such as those presented in @xcite are complicated by the fact that pv is generally a noisy field ( as vorticity is the curl of the velocity field ) .",
    "the velocity field is generally much smoother ; barriers to mixing estimated from the velocity field can be expected to be less sensitive to ( poorly - observed ) small - scale features of the flow .",
    "our new mathematical approach for detecting minimal transport structures with high accuracy has a broad range of potential applications to geophysical fluids .",
    "for example , transport properties in other long - lived atmospheric coherent structures such as blocking highs are of interest .",
    "there is also increasing interest in the transport properties of mesoscale ( on the order of 10 to 100 km in diameter ) ocean eddies and their influence on biological processes within the upper , sunlit part of the water column  @xcite .",
    "our input data consists of three - dimensional velocity fields obtained from the ecmwf era-40 data set ( http://data.ecmwf.int/data/index.html ) .",
    "the data is on a three - dimensional grid with 2.5 degree resolution in the latitude and longitude direction ( 144 by 73 grid points over the southern hemisphere ) .",
    "vertical coordinates are in units of hpa , with data provided at 5 pressure levels ( 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 , 20 hpa ) .",
    "we use 62 days of 6-hourly velocity fields from august 1 to september 31 in 1999 .",
    "the velocity fields will be interpolated linearly in space and in time ; thus we can only aim to detect features at the resolution of the data provided . while we recognize that there may be biases in the reanalysis data , particularly in the upper pressure levels near the model s upper boundary ,",
    "the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of the transfer operator approach to characterize coherent sets in highly unsteady flows .",
    "a climatology of the polar vortex would require a more careful consideration of the dataset under consideration    our interest is focused on the lagrangian dynamics in the higher latitudes of southern hemisphere .",
    "therefore , we will work on the phase space @xmath0\\times d$ ] , where @xmath1 is a circle parameterized from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and @xmath4 $ ] denotes the range of pressure in hpa .",
    "the lagrangian motion of passive tracers is represented by their trajectories @xmath5 , where the flow map @xmath6 is a function of time @xmath7 and gives the terminal point @xmath8 in @xmath9 of a particle initially located at @xmath10 at time @xmath11 and flowing for @xmath7 time units .",
    "the flow map @xmath12 is obtained as a solution of the nonautonomous ode @xmath13 with initial condition @xmath14 , where @xmath15 in this report is the prescribed velocity data .",
    "we shall be interested in finding a pair of sets @xmath16 at times @xmath11 and @xmath17 so that @xmath18 . moreover",
    ", this pair of sets should retain this property even when some diffusion is added to the system .",
    "let @xmath19 be a probability measure that is preserved by the flow at all times .",
    "we call @xmath16 a _",
    "@xmath20coherent pair _",
    "if @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the condition on addition of diffusion is crucial .",
    "clearly , there are many @xmath23-coherent pairs according to the above definition without diffusion .",
    "one may simply select any set @xmath24 and define @xmath25 to produce a @xmath26-coherent pair .",
    "in chaotic systems , such an image set @xmath27 is likely to be significantly less regular than @xmath28 because of stretching and folding .",
    "we are seeking @xmath23-coherent pairs with _ both _ sets regular . the requirement that ( [ eq : invariant ] ) hold even under diffusion acts as a selection principle , removing irregular sets , and selecting pairs that are robust to perturbation . at a certain level of diffusion",
    ", we may ask to find a coherent pair that maximises @xmath29 , and may expect a unique such pair .    to identify sets satisfying",
    ", we use a transfer operator @xmath30 defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the normalized lebesgue measure on @xmath9 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath33 is a density of passive tracers at time @xmath11 , @xmath34 provides their density at time @xmath17 induced by the flow @xmath35 .    in the autonomous setting , eigenfunctions @xmath36 of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 for all @xmath11 ) corresponding to positive eigenvalues @xmath39 were used to find _ almost - invariant sets _  @xcite .",
    "the key point of difference between these prior studies and the present work is that the sets studied previously do not move significantly over the time duration studied , while our present work seeks _ highly mobile _",
    "coherent sets , which are far from being almost - invariant . the new theory and numerics",
    "we introduce in the next section are specifically designed for nonautonomous or time - dependent systems .",
    "we partition @xmath9 into a grid of boxes @xmath40 .",
    "the pressure extents of the boxes are either 3 - 5 , 5 - 7 , 7 - 10 , or 10 - 20 hpa .",
    "each pressure layer consists of 6605 boxes of approximately equal cross - sectional area in the latitude / longitude directions , leading to @xmath41 boxes in total . to numerically approximate the transfer operator @xmath37",
    ", we construct a finite - dimensional approximation based on ulam s approach  @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath32 is a normalised volume measure in ( lat , lon , pressure ) coordinates .",
    "the entry @xmath43 may be interpreted as the probability that a point selected uniformly at random in @xmath44 at time @xmath11 will be in @xmath45 at time @xmath17 .",
    "the discretisation naturally produces a diffusion at the level of box diameters .",
    "as our boxes are of approximately the same dimensions as the distances between neighbouring era-40 data points , it is unnecessary to impose additional diffusion .",
    "if our boxes were significantly smaller the distances between neighbouring data points , it is possible that spurious fine features below the resolution supported by the data could appear ; in such a situation , additional diffusion would be required to remove spurious fine features .",
    "we estimate @xmath43 by @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 are uniformly distributed test points in @xmath44 and @xmath49 is obtained via a numerical integration .",
    "we set @xmath50 in our experiments and calculate @xmath49 using the standard runge - kutta method with step size of @xmath51 hours .",
    "linear interpolation is used to evaluate the velocity vector of a tracer lying between the data grid points in the longitude - latitude - pressure coordinate . in the temporal direction",
    "the data is affinely interpolated independently in the longitude , latitude and pressure level directions .",
    "the step size of @xmath51 hours is small enough to guarantee that a tracer will usually not flow to a neighboring data grid set ; this limits the numerical integration error .",
    "we assume that the mass density of particles in @xmath9 is at equilibrium and denote the fractional mass of particles contained in @xmath44 by @xmath52 .",
    "thus @xmath53 .",
    "we construct a reverse time transition matrix from time @xmath17 to @xmath11 denoted @xmath54 as @xmath55 .    introduce a weighted inner product @xmath56 .",
    "one has @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "our new approach to finding a coherent pair is intuitively based upon seeking a solution to @xmath59    we think of @xmath60 and @xmath61 as a coherent partition of @xmath9 .",
    "the numerator in ( [ combprob ] ) represents the size of the forward image of the vector @xmath62 .",
    "if there is little transport from @xmath28 to @xmath63 and from @xmath64 to @xmath65 ( so @xmath66 and @xmath67 are both coherent pairs ) , this numerator will be large . to produce non - trivial partitions",
    ", we may need to place lower bounds on the masses of both @xmath28 and @xmath68 .",
    "such a balanced bisection problem is combinatorially hard to solve .",
    "therefore we remove the discrete condition @xmath69 , allowing @xmath62 to float freely in @xmath70 . to effect a balancing of mass between positive and negative components of @xmath62",
    ", we insert the condition @xmath71 , for some nonnegative test vector @xmath72 .",
    "we will see shortly that the correct choice of @xmath73 is the minimizer of the central inner product .",
    "thus , we have @xmath74 letting @xmath75 and noting @xmath76 , this is easily solved by computing the second largest singular value @xmath77 of @xmath78 . denote the corresponding left singular vector by @xmath79 ( under multiplication on the right ) .",
    "the maximizing @xmath80 is constructed as @xmath81 .",
    "the minimizing @xmath73 turns out to be @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the leading left singular vector of @xmath78 .",
    "we also construct @xmath84 as the corresponding right singular vector and set @xmath85 .",
    "we assume that @xmath86 are normalised so that @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "one now has :    1 .",
    "@xmath89 , 2 .",
    "@xmath90 , 3 .",
    "@xmath91 ,    choosing @xmath73 via the minimization in ( [ relaxprob ] ) ensures that @xmath62 has the transformation properties 1 .  and 2 .  above , which are crucial to the definition of coherent sets",
    "we now extract a coherent pair @xmath28 and @xmath27 from a pair of vectors @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we create sets that are unions of boxes with @xmath62-values above certain thresholds .",
    "define @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "denote @xmath97 and @xmath98 .    for @xmath99 and @xmath100 ,",
    "define @xmath101 the quantity @xmath102 measures the discretised coherence for the pair @xmath16 .",
    "our procedure is summarised below :    1 .",
    "let @xmath103 .",
    "this is to enforce @xmath104 .",
    "2 .   set @xmath105 .",
    "the value of @xmath106 is selected to maximize the coherence .",
    "3 .   define @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we remark that one has to ensure that the sign of @xmath92 and @xmath93 manifest the same  parity \" , i.e. , the salient features of @xmath92 and @xmath93 to be extracted must have the same sign .",
    "it may thus be necessary to multiply one of @xmath92 or @xmath93 by @xmath109 .",
    "the major computational cost is the construction of @xmath110 .",
    "the calculation of large singular values and corresponding singular vectors is relatively quick , as @xmath110 is very sparse and iterative methods for sparse matrices may be used .",
    "the construction of @xmath110 requires numerical integration of @xmath111 trajectories for a flow duration of @xmath7 time units .",
    "the trajectory computations are of course highly parallisable , and further computational savings might be made by reusing already computed trajectory segments to link with new trajectories when the latter pass nearby .",
    "we computed the svd of @xmath112 at @xmath113 with @xmath114 days to obtain the left ( resp .",
    "right ) singular vectors @xmath79 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) and hence @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "figure  [ fig : svpv ] illustrates the vectors @xmath115 and @xmath116 with the components monotonically rescaled to uniformly distributed values between 0 and 1 .",
    "the highlighted part of these vectors describes the most coherent pair of sets .",
    "we now threshold @xmath115 and @xmath116 using the algorithm described above to extract the corresponding pair of coherent sets ; see figure  [ fig : coherentsetandpv ] .",
    "we find the optimal coherence ratio is @xmath117 ; this means that about 21% of the mass in @xmath118 on august 14 , 1999 falls outside @xmath119 on august 28 , 1999 .",
    "interestingly , our coherent pair has a `` hole '' over the south pole .",
    "further calculations have revealed that the reason for this is that around twice as many particles in this vertical hole on august 14 have exited the slice 3 - 20 hpa vertically by august 28 when compared to similar vertical exits of particles starting in the identified coherent set on august 14 .",
    "thus , this inner part of the vortex is less coherent and excluded from our coherent pair .",
    "this hole may be an artifact of the reanalysis data , although it is consistent with evidence of very strong polar descent in this region @xcite .",
    "we now compare our coherent pair of sets to sets defined by contours of potential vorticity ( pv ) .",
    "a common approach , developed in  @xcite is to define the vortex boundary as the isoline of the largest gradient of pv w.r.t .",
    "equivalent latitude_. we employ this approach to define potential coherent pairs at @xmath113 and @xmath120 .",
    "we additionally enforce the constraint that the mass enclosed by a pv isocontour at @xmath120 is approximately equal to the mass of the set enclosed by the determined pv isocontour at @xmath113 .",
    "the computational cost of the pv approach is naratip , please add material on computational cost .",
    "the two - dimensional plots of pv - determined coherent pairs at @xmath113 and @xmath120 are compared with the coherent sets in figure  [ fig : coherentsetandpv ] . to estimate the transport of particles from the inside the set at @xmath113 to outside the set at @xmath120 , we use a method similar to the contour crossing method introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the tracer particle is considered to be outside the boundary if its potential vorticity is larger than that of the boundary .",
    "note that the contour crossing method is originally developed to estimate the transport on the 2d isentropic surface but we would like to extend its utility to estimate the transport across the boundary surface .",
    "therefore , we interpolate the pv at the final time ( @xmath120 ) to obtain the pv at the particle s final position .",
    "we also interpolate the pv of the boundaries of the set at @xmath120 along the pressure coordinate to determine the boundary at the pressure level the advected particle resides in .",
    "this calculation shows that the fraction of particles initially inside the surface at @xmath113 remains inside the boundary surface at @xmath120 is approximately 0.7204 .",
    "thus our transfer operator based approach yields coherent pairs with 9.69% greater coherence .",
    "moreover , our approach is able to detect finer structures , including a vertical hole near the south pole .    ,",

    "the antarctic polar vortex is a well - known feature of the austral wintertime stratosphere separating polar and midlatitude air masses . the strong barrier to transport at the vortex edge plays an important role in ozone dynamics , particularly the development of the southern hemisphere ozone hole in austral spring .",
