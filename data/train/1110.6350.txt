    "the demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of space - time indicate the necessity of a complete theory of quantum gravity . this theory is expected to provide a new light on singularities present in classical cosmology .",
    "einstein s theory of general relativity leads to the occurrence of space - time singularities in a generic way .",
    "so , one may say , general relativity is severely incomplete and is unable to predict what will come out of a singularity . one of the outstanding problems in classical einstein cosmology is the big - bang singularity which is expected to be solved by quantum gravity .",
    "loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite is one of the best motivated theories of quantum gravity .",
    "lqg is a background independent , non perturbative approach to quantum gravity .",
    "when loop quantum gravity is applied to cosmology to analyse our universe , it is called loop quantum cosmology(lqc ) @xcite ( also see @xcite for a comprehensive review on lqc ) . in loop quantum cosmology ,",
    "the non perturbative effects add a term of -@xmath0 to the standard friedmann equation @xcite , where @xmath1 represents the energy density of the universe and @xmath2 is the critical density at which the universe is completely filled with a free massless scalar field when the scale factor reaches a minimum .",
    "the modification becomes important when the energy density of the universe approaches critical density(@xmath3 ) and causes the quantum bounce .",
    "so the classical big bang is replaced by a quantum big bounce in such a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "recently more and more researchers have paid their attention to lqc inspired by its appealing features , like avoidance of various singularities @xcite , inflation in loop quantum cosmology(lqc ) @xcite , large scale effect @xcite , present cosmic acceleration @xcite and so on .",
    "primordial black holes(pbhs ) are the black holes formed in the early universe @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the cosmological density at any time after the big bang with the density associated with a black hole shows that pbhs would have mass of the order of the particle horizon mass at their formation epoch .",
    "thus pbhs could span enermous mass range starting from @xmath4 g to the typical values of @xmath5 g. these black holes could be formed due to initial inhomogeneities @xcite , inflation @xcite , phase transitions @xcite , bubble collisions @xcite or the decay of cosmic loops @xcite . in 1974 hawking discovered that the black holes emit thermal radiation due to quantum effects @xcite .",
    "so the black holes get evaporated depending upon their initial masses .",
    "smaller the initial masses of the pbhs , quicker they evaporate .",
    "but the density of a black hole varies inversely with its mass .",
    "so high density is required to form lighter black holes and such high densities are available only in the early universe .",
    "so primordial black holes are the only black holes whose masses could be small enough to have evaporated by present time .",
    "there have been speculations that pbhs could act as seeds for structure formation @xcite and could also form a significant component of dark matter @xcite .",
    "since the cosmological enviornment was very hot and dense in the radiation dominated era , an appreciable amount of energy - matter from the surroundings can be absorbed by black holes .",
    "such accretion is responsible for the prolongation of life time of pbhs @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the evolution of pbh within the context of loop quantum gravity .",
    "first , we estimate the cosmic scale factor a(t ) and energy density @xmath1 ( t ) of the fluid filling the universe for different cosmic era within the context of loop quantum gravity . taking these as inputs ,",
    "pbh evolution is studied considering both the hawking evaporation and accretion of radiation by the pbh . the primary aim being to compare the results so obtained with the analyses carried out earlier within the context of general theory of relativity and brans - dicke theories .",
    "for a spatially flat frw universe(k=0 ) with scale factor(a ) , two friedmann equations in loop quantum gravity @xcite , take the form : @xmath6 where h is the hubble parameter , @xmath1 is the energy density and p is the pressure of the fluid filling the universe .",
    "the energy conservation equation is given by    @xmath7    from energy conservation equation , we get    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the time of radiation - matter equality .    using this solution in equation(1 ) , one gets the temporal behaviour of the scale factor @xmath10 as shown below .",

    "when a pbh evolves through radiation dominated era , it can also accrete radiation from the surrounding .",
    "the accretion of radiation leads to increase of its mass with the rate given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the radiation energy density of the surrounding of the black hole , @xmath25 is the black hole radius and @xmath26 is the accretion efficiency .",
    "the value of the accretion efficiency @xmath26 depends on the complex physical processes such as the mean free path of the particles comprising the radiation surrounding pbhs .",
    "any peculiar velocity of the pbh with respect to the cosmic frame could increase the value of @xmath26 @xcite . since the precise value of @xmath26 is unknown",
    ", it is customary @xcite to take the accretion rate to be proportional to the product of the surface area of the pbh and the energy density of radiation with @xmath27 o(1 ) .    after substituting the expressions for @xmath25 = 2gm and @xmath24 given by equation(8 ) in equation ( 10 ) , we get    @xmath28^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solving equation(11 ) , one can find    @xmath29^{1/2}+8\\pi f g^2 { \\rho_c}^{1/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{8\\pi g } } \\nonumber \\\\ tan^{-1}[{\\frac{\\rho_c}{\\rho_0 } } z(t_i)-1]^{1/2}\\big{\\}}^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    again using horizon mass as initial mass of pbh i.e ; @xmath30 = @xmath31=@xmath32 , we get    @xmath33^{1/2}-tan^{-1}[\\frac{\\rho_c}{\\rho_0}z(t_i)-1]^{1/2}\\}]^{-1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 .",
    "as is well known black holes can also loose mass through hawking evaporation . the rate at which the pbh mass decreases due to evaporation is given by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the blackbody constant and @xmath37 is the hawking temperature = @xmath38    now equation(14 ) becomes @xmath39    integrating the above equation , we get    @xmath40^{1/3}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 + and @xmath30 is the the black hole mass at its formation time @xmath42 .",

    "primordial black holes , as discussed earlier , are formed only in radiation dominated era .",
    "we now study pbhs so formed in two categories :    \\(i ) pbhs evaporating in radiation dominated era @xmath44 + ( ii)pbhs evaporating in matter dominated era @xmath45    ( @xmath46 )    if we consider both evaporation and accretion simultaneously , then the rate at which primordial black hole mass changes is given by    @xmath47^{-1}~-~\\frac{a_{h}}{256\\pi^3}\\frac{1}{g^2 m^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    solving above equation numerically , we construct the following table for pbhs which are evaporating in radiation dominated era . in our calculation , we have used @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
