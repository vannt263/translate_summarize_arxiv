    "density functional theory ( dft)@xcite is very successful in describing microscopic properties of fluids . however , when fluctuations at length scales much larger than the molecular size dominate , predictions of the standard dft are much less accurate .",
    "fluctuations at mesoscopic length scales are present in a critical region  @xcite , at an interface between coexisting fluid phases  @xcite and in systems with competing interactions .",
    "competing interactions are quite common in soft matter systems  @xcite . for example",
    ", charged particles repel each other at large separations , but at short separations attract each other with solvent - mediated forces .",
    "the above so called salr potential may lead to self - assembly into clusters of spherical or elongated shape , into layers or into networks , and to a periodic distribution of these objects in space  @xcite .",
    "competing interactions are also present in systems containing amphiphilic molecules  @xcite , and in thin magnetic films with dipolar interactions  @xcite .    for systems with competing interactions mean - field ( mf ) theories , including a local dft , predict stability of several ordered phases inside a bell - shaped region in the density - temperature phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "the disordered phase stable outside this region coexists with two ordered phases only - with periodically distributed clusters at low- and with periodically distributed voids at high density .",
    "the coexistence line between the disordered and the ordered phases lies close to the line of instability of the disordered phase with respect to periodic density fluctuations .",
    "when the instability line is approached , both the correlation length and the amplitude of the correlation function diverge  @xcite .",
    "the latter result is clearly nonphysical , since the correlation function for dimensionless density is bounded from above by @xmath3 .    in simulations the ordered phases",
    "have been observed too , but the phase diagram is significantly different  @xcite .",
    "the stability region of the ordered phases is much smaller  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a less ordered phase is stable between the stability regions of two different ordered phases  @xcite , in contrast to the mf results  @xcite . in the case of a triangular lattice model with competing first - neighbor attraction and third - neighbor repulsion  @xcite , at low temperature",
    "@xmath4 a molten lamella phase occupies some phase - space region between the stability regions of the phase with periodically distributed clusters and the phase with periodically distributed stripes  @xcite . at higher @xmath4 the disordered fluid is stable between the ordered cluster phase and the molten lamella .",
    "the transition between the fluid and the molten lamella is continuous at high @xmath4 and becomes first order at the tricritical point . in the molten lamella discovered in ref.@xcite",
    "the orientational order of stripes is present but the translational order is absent .",
    "a similar phase called a `` nematic phase '' was recently detected in magnetic films with competing interactions  @xcite in a continuous brazovskii - type model  @xcite . according to these new discoveries , instead of the fluctuation - induced first - order phase transition between the disordered and the periodically ordered phases predicted earlier by brazovskii  @xcite , a continuous or a first - order transition between the fluid and",
    "the molten - lamella phases occurs .",
    "in addition to the presence of new phases and significant modifications of the phase - coexistence , the fluctuations at the mesoscopic length scale lead to significantly different properties of the disordered inhomogeneous phase . in simulation snapshots of the disordered phase clusters or layers are clearly visible , indicating that this phase can be very inhomogeneous  @xcite . even though the distribution of these objects is not periodic , they can be correlated over large distances .",
    "the disordered inhomogeneous phase may thus be considered as a molten periodic phase , with the long - range order destroyed by the mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "the effects of fluctuations on the disordered phase were determined in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice model with competing first - neighbor attraction and third - neighbor repulsion by the exact transfer matrix method @xcite . in the ground state ( @xmath5 ) of this model a dilute phase ( vacuum ) is stable for small values of the chemical potential @xmath0 and a dense phase ( fully occupied lattice ) is stable for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "when the repulsion is sufficiently strong , an ordered phase with periodic distribution of clusters and density @xmath6 is stable for intermediate values of @xmath0 . at @xmath7",
    "only a disordered phase is stable , but the presence of clusters at low @xmath4 is reflected in a very large correlation length , and in a specific shape of the @xmath8 curve .",
    "it contains three inflection points at low @xmath4 - the central one at @xmath6 and the other two at @xmath0 corresponding to the @xmath5 phase transitions .",
    "for @xmath9 a step - like @xmath8 curve was obtained .",
    "the very small compressibility of the system for @xmath10 indicates formation of clusters that repel each other at short separations .",
    "the very large compressibility at the other two inflection points signal an approach to the phase transitions that occur at @xmath5 . only at high @xmath4 a single inflection point at @xmath6",
    "is present .",
    "in contrast , in mf the @xmath8 curve has a single inflection point for the whole range of stability of the disordered phase .",
    "thus , mf fails to predict the qualitative features of the disordered inhomogeneous phase . only for high @xmath4 , where strong inhomogeneities are no longer present , qualitative properties of the disordered phase are correctly described by mf .",
    "mf predicts stability of a periodically ordered phase instead of strongly inhomogeneous disordered phase .    from the comparison of the mf and simulation or exact results",
    "it evidently follows that an inclusion of the most relevant mesoscopic fluctuations is necessary not only for the quantitative , but also for the qualitative description of systems with mesoscopic inhomogeneities . a tractable theory that would accurately predict properties of systems with inhomogeneities on the mesoscopic length scale is still missing , however .",
    "a theory correctly incorporating mesoscopic fluctuations should predict at least a correct topology of the phase diagram and correct properties of the disordered phase .",
    "effects of periodic fluctuations of the order parameter ( op ) @xmath11 are described by the brazovskii field theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the brazovskii functional @xmath12 $ ] depends on free parameters , and quantities such as compressibility for a particular volume fraction @xmath1 and @xmath4 can not be determined , unless a relation between the free parameters and measurable quantities is known .",
