    "as their most prominent universal feature , high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) always display antiferromagnetism ( af ) and @xmath6wave superconductivity in close proximity , in their phase diagram .",
    "recently , a unifying theory has been proposed , according to which these two at first sight radically different phases are `` two faces of one and the same coin '' .",
    "they are unified by a common symmetry principle , the so(5 ) symmetry @xcite . in the meantime , numerical simulations , i.e.  exact cluster diagonalizations ,",
    "have verified that this symmetry principle is obeyed for widely used microscopic models for the high-@xmath3 cuprates , namely the ( two - dimensional ) @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 and hubbard models , to within an accuracy which is better than the average superconducting energy gap @xcite .",
    "these microscopic models are known to reproduce salient experimental results of the normal state of the high-@xmath8 cuprates , including in particular the antiferromagnetic state .",
    "so(5 ) symmetry then implies that these microscopic models also display @xmath6wave superconductivity .",
    "this gives rise to a microscopic description of the complex phase diagrams of the htsc from the insulating antiferromagnetic phase over to the metallic normal state and , finally , to the @xmath6wave superconducting phase .",
    "these results were further corroborated between one and two dimensions by weak - coupling renormalization - group calculations , which demonstrated that rather general ladder hamiltonians , including longer - ranged interactions @xcite and hoppings @xcite , flow to an so(5)-invariant fixed point @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the basic numerical and analytical calculations are summarized , and recent insights regarding the microscopic principle behind so(5 ) symmetry @xcite are reviewed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    section [ one_to_one ] describes a new idea and dynamical principle behind so(5 ) symmetry .",
    "it is shown that a formulation in terms of triplet and hole fluctuations around an `` rvb vacuum '' allows for a physically transparent demonstration of the corner stone in so(5 ) theory , i.e.  that af and sc are `` two faces of one and the same coin '' . by starting from this `` rvb vacuum '' @xmath9 , which represents the spin liquid state at half - filling , we demonstrate that an af ordered state can be generated by forming a coherent state @xmath10@xmath11@xmath7 , i.e.  af wave - vector state . however , in the so(5 ) theory , the @xmath12-like triplet with momentum @xmath13 and the hole pair with momentum @xmath14 are components of one and the same so(5 ) vector .",
    "they are rotated into each other by the so(5 ) generating operator @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that the above coherent state with condensed triplets can be so(5)-rotated into a corresponding coherent state with @xmath16 replaced by the ( hole- ) pair creation operator @xmath17 this state corresponds to hole pairs condensed into the @xmath18 state , i.e.  a superconducting state . in other words : both the af and the sc state can be viewed as a kind of condensation out of the rvb state , or the spin liquid .",
    "if the so - constructed af state is the actual ground state at half - filling , then this physically very appealing so(5 ) construction yields automatically the ground state in the doped situation , i.e.  the sc state @xcite .",
    "in section [ micro_models ] , we summarize numerical evidence for the approximate so(5 ) symmetry of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard and @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model .",
    "the so(5 ) symmetry organizes the low - energy degrees of freedom and gives a new microscopic picture of the transition from an af ground state to the @xmath6wave sc state as the chemical potential is varied @xcite : our results show that the @xmath6wave sc ground states away from half - filling are obtained from the higher spin states at half - filling through so(5 ) rotations .",
    "we use a general and direct recipe for checking microscopic hamiltonians for so(5 ) symmetry , i.e.  the concept of `` superspin multiplets '' @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that the low - energy excited eigenstates of a cluster display a definite structure characteristic of a particular symmetry , a scheme which has already provided convincing evidence for the long - range order of the heisenberg af on a triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "we have numerically diagonalized the low - lying states of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model near half - filling and found that they fit into irreducible representations ( irreps ) of the so(5 ) symmetry group . at a critical value @xmath5 of the chemical potential ,",
    "the superspin multiplets are nearly degenerate and , therefore , higher spin af states at half - filling can be freely rotated into dsc states away from half - filling .",
    "our overall exact - diagonalization results , when further combined with a detailed spectroscopy of `` so(5)-allowed '' and `` so(5)-forbidden '' transitions between the superspin multiplets , suggest that the low - energy dynamics of the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model @xcite can be described by a quantum nonlinear @xmath19model with anisotropic couplings , and the transition is that of a superspin flop transition @xcite .",
    "it is truly remarkable that , while the physical properties of af and dsc states appear to be diagonal opposite , and they are characterized by very different form of order , there exists , nevertheless , a fundamental so(5 ) symmetry that unifies them .    in these two - dimensional ( 2d ) microscopic models , the undoped situation  in agreement with the experimental situation in the cuprates  corresponds to that of a mott insulator with broken so(3 ) or spin rational symmetry : long - range af order is realized .",
    "the so(5)-symmetry principle then tells us how this long - range magnetic order and the accompanying low - energy spin excitations are mapped onto the corresponding off - diagonal long - range sc order and the low - energy `` goldstone bosons '' ( the @xmath20mode ) in the doped situation @xcite .",
    "however , there exists also a second class of mott - type insulators without long - range af order , i.e.  spin liquids , which have a gap to spin excitation .",
    "there is growing experimental evidence that they are also intimately related to the physics of high-@xmath3 compounds : not only do these compounds show above the nel temperature and superconducting transition temperature at small dopings signs of such a spin gap , but there exist also copper - oxides with a cuo@xmath21 plane containing line - defects , which result in ladder - like arrangements of @xmath22atoms ( for a summary , see @xcite ) . these systems can be described in terms of coupled two - leg ladders @xcite , which exhibit a spin gap in the insulating compound and thus belong to the spin - liquid mott - insulator variety . also the related `` stripe phases '' of the 2d cuo@xmath21 planes in the cuprate superconductors",
    "have recently received considerable attention @xcite . in these systems , the apparent connection between the spin gap and superconductivity must be explained .    in order to illustrate how the so(5 ) theory can , in principle , cope with the challenge , an exactly so(5 ) invariant ladder model",
    "has recently been constructed @xcite . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the spin - gap magnon mode of the mott insulator evolves continuously into the `` @xmath23resonance '' mode of the superconductor .",
    "this so(5 ) symmetric model offers a reference point around which departures from the so(5 ) symmetry can be studied . then , two key questions arise , the first being the relationship of the exact so(5 ) ladder to the `` physical '' @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 or hubbard ladders and the second regarding the connection to the other variety of mott insulators , i.e.  the ones with long - range af order .    with regard to the first question ,",
    "progress was recently made in the regime of weak - coupling : using the weak - coupling renormalization group method , two independent works @xcite have demonstrated that rather generic ladder models at half - filling flow to an so(5 ) symmetric fixed point .",
    "this work is reviewed in section [ ladders ] .    in section [ ladders ] , we also summarize work , which tries to numerically attack both questions in the experimentally relevant intermediate to strong - coupling regimes . as shown in this recent work @xcite ,",
    "so(5 ) symmetry has profound implications for the dynamical correlation functions , most notably the single - particle spectrum .",
    "specific predictions of so(5 ) , like a `` generalized rigid band behavior '' @xcite and the appearance of sidebands in the inverse photoemission spectrum @xcite may indeed have been observed long ago in the actual 2d @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model and also in recent angular - resolved photoemission experiments @xcite . motivated by the present ladder theory ,",
    "we have carried out more detailed spectroscopies on the 2d model and obtained results in strong support of so(5 ) .",
    "finally , we and other authors @xcite have demonstrated that , despite the , at first sight , rather unphysical parameter values of the so(5 ) symmetric ladder model , a `` landau mapping '' to the more realistic @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model is feasible .",
    "this may suggest that the so(5 ) symmetric ladder is indeed the generic effective hamiltonian for 2-leg ladder systems and for the above spin - liquid mott - insulator variety , in general .",
    "in the htsc , the dominant charge - carrier dynamics takes place in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) cuo@xmath21-planes @xcite .",
    "each cuo@xmath21 unit cell contains an effective magnetic moment of spin @xmath24 essentially due to the cu ion .",
    "neighboring cu - spins form singlets  the energy win due to the singlet formation , the magnetic exchange @xmath2 is relatively large @xmath25mev @xmath26k . on the other hand , the temperatures for the transition into both low - temperature phases , the af and the sc phases , @xmath27 and @xmath3 , are both significantly lower and of similar magnitude @xmath28k for @xmath29 and @xmath30k for @xmath31 .",
    "already this order of magnitude suggests that the mechanism of superconductivity does not directly result from the singlet formation , but is instead related to the mechanism , which results in af in the undoped , insulating situation .",
    "indeed , both low temperature phases of the cuprates are `` ordered '' : in the undoped case , i.e.  in the insulator , we have af order , in the doped case , the phase coherence of the superconductor and both phases are in the htsc in immediate vicinity ( the `` spin glass phase '' , which occurs in some cuprates , is likely due to disorder ) .",
    "therefore , it seems tempting to unify these low - temperature phases , despite the fact that on first glance , they appear dramatically different : on the one hand , the insulator and , on the other hand , the ideal conductor , i.e.  the superconductor .",
    "let us consider , at first , the insulator : at high - temperatures @xmath32 k , the singlet pairs are completely disordered .",
    "this state is termed , therefore , a spin liquid .",
    "how does one arrive from this disordered state at high temperatures , at an ordered nel state at low temperatures ? to solve this problem",
    ", we shall consider a dynamical principle , which gives a particularly simple and transparent demonstration of the key feature of so(5 ) theory , namely the one - to - one correspondence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity : according to this dynamical principle @xcite , the ordered af state can be considered as a kind of bose - einstein condensation of triplet excitations .",
    "the sc state , on the other hand , corresponds to a bose - einstein type of condensation of cooper pairs , namely in the cuprate materials of hole pairs .",
    "triplet excitation and hole - pairs excitation are `` two phases of one and the same coin '' in similarity to other unifying concepts such as the isospin theory of proton and neutron in nuclear physics @xcite . the condensation energy yields then a new lower temperature scale @xmath29 and @xmath3 .    here",
    ", so(5 ) symmetry enters in detail : like a `` magnifying glass '' , this symmetry principle allows to differentiate the low - energy physics of the order of @xmath3 and , in particular , to unify the , in principle , competing af and sc phases ( specifically , this symmetry principle `` rotates '' triplet excitations into hole - pair excitations and vice versa ) . unifying principles via symmetry are , of course , known from many fields of physics , such as quarks in high - energy physics , the predictions of which were inspired by the su(3 ) classification of hadronic spectra .",
    "how does such a unification take place in the htsc , i.e.  in solid - state physics ?",
    "the order parameter of the af is the sublattice magnetisation , a real 3-dimensional vector ; if this vector is different from zero , we have af order .",
    "consider now two fixed neighboring sites in the 2-dimensional af , let s say in the configuration ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "this fixed spin configuration may be viewed as being due to an superposition of the singlet ( @xmath34 ) with the @xmath35triplet ( @xmath36 ) . to create the macroscopic 2-dimensional af in the cuo@xmath21 plane , therefore",
    ", we have to mix triplet excitations already at high temperatures into all possible singlet configurations of the spin liquid .",
    "the af states then result as a kind of `` condensation '' of the triplet excitations into the lowest possible energy state @xcite .",
    "the three components of the triplet correspond to the three possible orientations of the af and the density of the `` condensed triplets '' corresponds to the magnitude of the sublatice magnetisation .",
    "this dynamical principle illustrates the relation between af and sc states rather clearly : if , in the af state ( we shall see below that it corresponds to a coherent state ) the triplet excitation operator is replaced by a hole pair creation operator , we obtain a coherent state which creates a macroscopic number of cooper pairs , i.e.  a sc state .",
    "the `` rotation '' af@xmath37sc , therefore , is described by an operator , the @xmath38operator of so(5 ) theory @xcite , which replaces triplets by hole pairs .    in the following ,",
    "we give a particularly simple illustration for this key - feature of so(5 ) theory , which can be worked out for a ladder @xcite , and discuss the equivalence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity for this example .",
    "the ground state of the ladder models is actually a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) type of vacuum without af long - range - order @xcite .",
    "however , for illustrative purposes , let us now construct an af ordered state ( which is in general not an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ) by condensing magnons into the rvb ground state .",
    "one can express the operator of staggered magnetization in @xmath12-direction as @xmath39 where e.g.  @xmath40 projects onto states where the @xmath41 rung has the configuration @xmath42 ( see fig .  [ fig_ladder ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath43 where @xmath44 creates a singlet(@xmath45-tiplet ) on rung @xmath46 .",
    "therefore @xmath47.\\ ] ] if we now form the coherent state @xmath48 which corresponds to @xmath12-like triplets condensed into the @xmath49@xmath11@xmath7 state , and treat the @xmath50 as ordinary bosons , we obtain @xmath51 this calculation shows that by starting from a spin liquid , i.e.  an rvb vacuum , an antiferromagnetically ordered state with @xmath52 in @xmath12-direction can be generated by condensing @xmath12-like triplet - excitations into the @xmath49@xmath11@xmath7 state . at this point , we can invoke the so(5 ) symmetry of the model @xcite , which tells us that since the @xmath12-like triplet with momentum @xmath7 and the hole pair with momentum @xmath14 are two different components of a 5-vector , they are dynamically indistinguishable .",
    "this means that the af state , with condensed triplets , can be so(5)-rotated into a state with condensed hole pairs .",
    "it follows that , if the antiferromagnetic state were the ground state at half - filling ( which is the case for 2d materials and physical ladder systems ) , we can replace all @xmath12-like triplets by hole pairs with momentum @xmath14 and by so(5 ) symmetry automatically obtain the ground state in the doped case .",
    "the latter then consists of hole - pairs along the rungs condensed into the @xmath49@xmath11@xmath14 states and thus is necessarily superconducting .",
    "in other words : both the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting state may be viewed as some kind of condensate ` on top of ' the rung - rvb state .",
    "so(5 ) symmetry then simply implies that the condensed objects are combined into a single vector , whence the unification of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity follows in a most natural way .",
    "the above derivation makes sense only in a strong coupling limit , where a ground - state description starting out from rung - singlets is appropriate .",
    "one might expect , however , that similar considerations will apply also for cases with a weak coupling within the rungs @xcite ( see also section [ ladders ] ) .    in two dimensions ( 2d ) the above interpretation of so(5 ) symmetry hinges crucially on two points : first",
    ", the excitation spectrum of a 2d spin - liquid or rvb state must consist of bosonic triplets ( rather than e.g.  fermionic ` spinons ' ) , whose condensation into the minimum of their dispersion at @xmath53 leads to antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "this would imply that the antiferromagnetic state in 2d also could be interpreted as a condensate of triplet bosons .",
    "work along this line is in progress and promising @xcite .",
    "second , these triplet - like bosons with momentum @xmath53 must be dynamically equivalent to a @xmath54 cooper pair .",
    "having established this equivalence one could immediately conclude that the antiferromagnetic phase ( viz ` condensate of triplets ' ) is identical to the @xmath55-wave superconducting phase ( viz ` condensate of hole pairs ' ) in the same sense as two nuclei belonging to the same isomultiplet are ` identical ' .",
    "since the @xmath15-operator in 2d @xcite precisely converts a triplet with momentum @xmath53 into a @xmath55-wave hole pair ( see section [ micro_models ] ) , the latter requirement is equivalent to @xmath56=\\omega_0 \\hat{\\pi}$ ] .",
    "this commutation relation , which will be discussed in detail in the next section , tells us whether the dynamics of charge carriers respects so(5 ) symmetry , i.e.  the hamiltonian is in accord with the so(5 ) rotation @xmath15 .",
    "ideally , we should then have zero for the commutator .",
    "this will happen for a critical chemical potential @xmath57 , right where the transition into the doped system takes place . further changing @xmath58 gives rise to a precession frequency , or energy to perform the af @xmath59sc rotation @xmath60 .",
    "the energy shift @xmath61 here would correspond to the mass difference of proton and neutron in the isospin algebra .",
    "the validity of this eigenoperator relation has already been verified numerically @xcite .",
    "the dynamical principle of the previous section suggests to unify the triplet excitations @xmath62 ( corresponding to a vector ) and hole - pair excitations @xmath63 ( described by ( re@xmath64 ) , im@xmath64 ) into a @xmath65dimensional vector , the so - called superspin vector .",
    "more precisely , zhang suggested to group the af order parameter @xmath66 with @xmath67 and @xmath55-wave sc order parameter @xmath63 into a single five - component vector , the superspin@xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the @xmath70 superconducting order parameter .",
    "@xmath71 stands for the af nel vector and @xmath72 are the pauli spin matrices .",
    "the transition from af to dsc is then viewed as a kind of `` superspin flop '' transition as a function of the chemical potential or doping , where the direction of the superspin changes abruptly .",
    "this transition or so(5 ) rotation is formally described by the so - called @xmath38operator .",
    "the `` superspin flop '' transition is analogous to the problem of a spinning top in a uniform gravitational field , or a magnetic moment in a uniform magnetic field , as in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "as we shall see , in the presence of the symmetry - breaking field ( which , in our case is the chemical potential or doping ) , the order parameter is forced to precess , and this explicit breaking of the so(5 ) invariance induces rotations between af and dsc states ( with frequency @xmath61 ) and governs the competition between these two phenomena .",
    "mathematically , the @xmath38operator can straightforwardly be constructed @xcite : as a rotation from af to dsc , it has to patch up the differences in the quantum numbers of the corresponding order parameters . since @xmath63 has spin @xmath73@xmath11@xmath14 , whereas @xmath74 has @xmath73@xmath11@xmath75 ( which is obvious from our triplet excitation picture in the last section ) , @xmath15 has to carry @xmath73@xmath11@xmath75 , i.e.  it must be a triplet operator .",
    "@xmath74 has no charge , @xmath63 has charge @xmath76 , therefore , @xmath13 must create charge @xmath77 finally , @xmath74 has momentum @xmath78 @xmath63 instead has @xmath79 , thus , @xmath80 must have momentum @xmath81 combination of these requirements fixes the operator uniquely up to a form factor , which is given by @xmath55-wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "this results in the @xmath80 operators ( we just give one of them ) @xmath82 charge conjugation and spin lowering operation gives five other similar operators . in real - space representation ,",
    "the @xmath83 operator does precisely what we discussed in the previous section , namely it replaces triplets oriented in @xmath84 and @xmath85 planar directions by @xmath70 hole ( electron ) pairs .",
    "these @xmath80 operators were first introduced by demler and zhang @xcite to explain the resonant neutron scattering peaks in the @xmath86 superconductors .",
    "together with the total spin @xmath87 , which is the generator of the so(3 ) spin rotation forming a subgroup of so(5 ) , and the charge operator @xmath88 generating the @xmath89 charge symmetry ( which is also a subgroup of so(5 ) ) , the six @xmath15 ( @xmath90 ) operators form the ten generators @xmath91 of the so(5 ) algebra ( for definition of @xmath91 , see @xcite ) .",
    "as constructed , the @xmath80 operators indeed rotate the af order parameter into the dsc order parameter , i.e. @xmath92 } \\left [ \\hat{\\pi }",
    "_ { \\alpha } ^{\\dag},s\\left ( { \\bf q}\\right ) _ { \\beta } \\right ] = i\\delta _ { \\alpha \\beta } \\delta ^{\\dag},\\ ] ] and vice versa",
    ".    we have , thus , apparently accomplished the task of unifying af with sc : the corresponding order parameters are grouped into a five dimensional object , and sc is `` nothing '' but af viewed in some rotated coordinates and vice versa ! this construction looks a bit similar to the unification of @xmath93 and @xmath94 by the lorentz group .",
    "but , so far , this is only a mathematical construction , we havent asked if `` mother nature '' approves the so(5 ) construct or not .    in the high@xmath95 problem , `` mother nature ''",
    "is very complicated , but we can check the so(5 ) symmetry within some microscopic models , which are known to reproduce salient features of the phase diagram of htsc .",
    "such microscopic hamiltonians , i.e.  hubbard and @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 models , successfully model the mott - hubbard insulator to metal transition @xcite , which is driven by the coulomb correlation @xmath96ev , i.e.  by `` high - energy '' physics .",
    "they also model prominent features of the magnetic interactions on an energy scale of order @xmath97ev @xcite .",
    "however , their low - energy content of order of the average sc gap @xmath98 has so far eluded both analytical and numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "we shall demonstrate that so(5 ) symmetry overcomes this major obstacle ; it clarifies the role of competing orders and gives a microscopic description of the transition from af to dsc ground states , as the chemical potential is varied .",
    "one can check the so(5 ) symmetry by evaluating the commutator between the hamiltonian with the @xmath38operators .",
    "in particular , numerical @xcite works , summarized below , show that the @xmath80 operators are approximate eigenoperators of the hubbard hamiltonian , in the sense that @xmath99 } \\lbrack h,\\hat{\\pi } _ { \\alpha } ^{\\dagger}]=\\omega _ { 0}\\hat{\\pi } _ { \\alpha } ^{\\dagger},\\ ] ] where the eigen - frequency @xmath100 which is the energy to perform the af@xmath37dsc rotation , is of the order of @xmath2 , and proportional to the number of holes .",
    "this relation ( [ [ h , pi+ ] ] ) reminds us of the commutation relation between the transverse spin components @xmath101 and @xmath102 in a magnetic field and the zeeman hamiltonian , with @xmath103 being proportional to the @xmath104field . in our case , the so(5 )",
    "symmetry is broken explicitly by the chemical potential , i.e.  @xmath103 is proportional to the hole count or doping .",
    "thus , the pattern of explicit symmetry breaking is simple and familiar , and , therefore , easy to handle .    in the following ,",
    "we employ a kind of `` computer spectroscopy '' to test whether the dynamics of the charge carriers , i.e.  the hamiltonian , respects so(5 ) symmetry and ( [ [ h , pi+ ] ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "ever since the early days of quantum dynamics , group theoretical interpretation of spectroscopy revealed deep symmetry and profound unity of nature .",
    "atomic spectra can be fitted into irreducible representations ( irreps ) of so(3 ) , and the regular patterns which emerged from this classification offered fundamental understanding of the periodic table . after the discovery of a large number of hadrons ,",
    "the `` embarrassment of riches '' was removed by the classification of hadronic spectra into irreps of su(3 ) and this hidden regularity inspired the predictions of quarks , the fundamental building block of the universe .",
    "in our quest for understanding the fundamental design of nature , the importance of symmetry can never be over - emphasized .    in our work",
    ", we used a different kind of spectroscopy and its classification into a different kind of symmetry .",
    "the spectroscopy is performed on a computer , which numerically diagonalizes microscopic hamiltonians , i.e.  hubbard and @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 models widely believed @xcite to model high-@xmath3 superconductors .",
    "as the simplest 2d lattice model for correlated electrons , the one - band hubbard model is defined as @xmath105 with nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath0 and coulomb correlation @xmath106 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model has the hamiltonian @xmath107 p.\\ ] ] as in the hubbard model , @xmath108 denotes a summation over nearest - neighbors on the 2d square lattice and @xmath109 projects onto the subspace with no doubly occupied sites .",
    "the latter constraint reflects the strong correlations in the @xmath110 limit of the hubbard model .",
    "first numerical evidence for the approximate so(5 ) symmetry of the hubbard model came recently from exact diagonalizations of small - sized ( 10 sites ) clusters @xcite , studying dynamic correlation functions involving the af / dsc rotation @xmath80 operator .",
    "we observe that ( [ [ h , pi+ ] ] ) is nothing but the ladder operator relation familiar from standard quantum mechanics problems such as the harmonic oscillator or the spin rising @xmath111 and lowering @xmath112 operators .",
    "if this equation is fulfilled , then the equal level distance @xmath103 between the `` rungs '' of the ladder should appear  like in nmr or optical spectroscopy  as a sharp peak in the @xmath15@xmath1@xmath15 correlation function , well separated from a higher - energy incoherent background .",
    "this indeed is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig_10sites2d](a),(b ) , which displays a typical result for the @xmath113 correlation function in a ten - site hubbard cluster with @xmath114 for dopings of one hole - pair @xmath115 and two hole - pairs @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath103 is a small energy , scaling with the hole count away from half - filling @xmath117 i.e.  @xmath118    the approximate relation ( [ [ h , pi+ ] ] ) is highly nontrivial .",
    "one could ask if a similar relation would exist for a modified @xmath80 operator which rotates af into @xmath119wave sc order parameters .",
    "the answer is negative @xcite , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_10sites2d](c ) which demonstrates that a @xmath120rotation with @xmath119wave symmetry just generates an incoherent background and no sharp `` @xmath20resonance '' .",
    "therefore , there is only an approximate symmetry between af and @xmath6wave sc ( and not @xmath119wave sc ) near half filling .    in the next step",
    ", we use a most general and direct recipe for checking microscopic hamiltonians for so(5 ) symmetry , i.e.  the concept of `` superspin multiplets '' @xcite .",
    "we consider the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model , which , because of its more limited hilbert space ( no double occupancies ) , allows the exact diagonalization of larger systems ( 18 , 20 sites ) .",
    "since the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model explicitly projects out the states in the upper hubbard band , some of the questions @xcite raised recently about the compatibility between the mott hubbard gap and so(5 ) symmetry can also be answered explicitly . in particular ,",
    "if there is an approximate so(5 ) symmetry of the microscopic model , the low - energy states of this model should fall into irreducible representations ( irreps ) of so(5 ) . in a given quantum mechanical system",
    ", the direction of the so(5 ) superspin vector is quantized in a way similar to an ordinary so(3 ) spin , and the classically intuitive picture of the precession of the so(5 ) superspin vector under the influence of the chemical potential @xcite can be identified with the equal level - spacing between the members of so(5 ) multiplets carrying different charge .",
    "therefore , numerically identifying the low - lying states of the microscopic model with the so(5 ) irreps can lead to detailed understanding of the one - to - one correspondence and the level crossing between the excited states of the af and the dsc states , and thereby lead us to the microscopic mechanism by which the af changes into the dsc state . while finite - size calculations can not generally be used to prove the existence of long - range order in infinite systems , the spectroscopic information about the so(5 ) symmetry can be used as input for the effective field theory @xcite which captures the low - energy and long - distance physics of the problem .",
    "exact diagonalizations ( e.g.  @xcite ) commonly study ground - state correlations , but their spatial decay is often inconclusive as a test of order due to small system size . yet",

    "the fs consists of four points : two bands @xmath201 and @xmath202 , each one with two fermi points corresponding to right- and left - moving fermions .",
    "since we are interested in low - energy properties very close to the fs , the fermion dispersion can safely be taken as linear around the fs with ( in general ) band - dependent velocities @xmath203 .",
    "the idea of the rg is to divide the electronic excitations within the brillouin zone into high - energy and low - energy modes , the latter being modes restricted within an energy @xmath204 from the fermi energy .",
    "one then eliminates the high - energy modes by integrating them out and constructs an effective hamiltonian which is restricted to the low - energy excitations . the parameters of the new effective low - energy hamiltonian thus depend on the energy cutoff @xmath205 .",
    "also the total spectral weights at the fs ( quasiparticle weights ) @xmath206 of the two bands are reduced due to the reduction of the cutoff and depend on @xmath205 . for this reason , in order to recover the _ canonical _ fermi operators within the low - energy subspace , one should reabsorb @xmath206 into the definition of the fermi operators and transform to @xmath207 .",

    ", the scattering amplitudes in the interaction @xmath198 can also be considered as dependent only on the fermi momenta closest to where the corresponding processes take place as well as on the spin of the scattered particles @xcite .",
    "the so(5)invariant part @xmath211 of @xmath198 can conveniently be written as a sum of products of so(5 ) scalar contractions in the form @xmath212 where @xmath213 are so(5 ) four - spinor fermi operator ( see refs .",

    "the striking result of our calculation is that , by integrating away the high - energy modes , from some energy scale @xmath219 on , the so(5)-breaking part of the hamiltonian @xmath220 eventually vanishes with respect to the so(5)symmetric part . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figproc ] , we show the rg flow for the @xmath195 case ( here the so(5)-breaking term appears only in the interacting part of the hamiltonian ) . in the bulk of the same figure ,",
