    "vacuum field fluctuations are modified close to material surfaces , resulting in the usually attractive casimir - polder force @xcite on a nearby ground - state atom .",
    "this effect has been measured by a number of experimental techniques , including deflection of atomic beams @xcite , classical @xcite and quantum reflection by the attractive casimir - polder potential @xcite , and dipole oscillations of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) close to a dielectric surface @xcite .",
    "more recently , experiments involving non - trivial geometries paved the way to new applications .",
    "the measured reflection probability of a bec from a si surface with a square array of closely spaced thin pillars increased by a factor of nearly four as compared to a flat surface @xcite .",
    "a si surface with an array of wall - like parallel ridges was shown to work as a reflection diffraction grating for atoms incident along a nearly grazing direction @xcite .",
    "several diffraction orders in the quantum reflection from a microstructured grating consisting of cr strips on a flat quartz substrate were measured  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , nano - fabricated transmission atom gratings allow for a direct measurement of the dispersive atom - surface potential in the non - retarded van der waals regime @xcite .    remarkable experimental progress has also been achieved in the closely related field of casimir interactions between material surfaces @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have revealed interesting geometry effects in the normal force between a si rectangular ( lamellar ) grating and a metallic spherical surface @xcite and in the lateral force between two metallic gratings @xcite .",
    "this ensemble of new experiments clearly motivates the theoretical analysis of how geometry molds the quantum field fluctuations giving rise to the casimir - polder and casimir interactions . in this paper",
    ", we develop a non - perturbative theory for the casimir - polder interaction between a ground state atom and a dielectric grating .",
    "our results are valid , in principle , for arbitrary values of the grating amplitude .",
    "preliminary results were already applied in the analysis of quantum vortex generation in a bec induced by the casimir - polder potential of a rotating grating  @xcite . here",
    "we present a detailed derivation of the casimir - poder potential and a variety of numerical examples that illustrate its main characteristics .",
    "calculations beyond the simple planar geometry are extremely involved because different frequency and length scales contribute to the interaction .",
    "since dispersive forces are not additive , it is not possible to build up the atom - surface potential from the more elementary atom - atom interaction . in the pairwise summation ( pws )",
    "approach , the non - additivity is corrected by a ` calibration ' provided by the planar case at a given separation distance range @xcite .",
    "since the non - additivity correction is geometry and distance dependent , pws results are barely more accurate @xcite than the results obtained by taking the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite , in which the potential is simply approximated by the planar case taken at the local atom - surface distance .",
    "only recently new theoretical tools have been developed for analyzing non - trivial geometries  @xcite beyond the pfa and pws approaches . in the scattering approach @xcite ,",
    "the interaction potential is written in terms of reflection operators describing non - specular scattering ( diffraction ) by non - planar surfaces .",
    "this allows for a description of the casimir effect that captures its full geometry dependence . in the specific case of the casimir - polder interaction between a ground - state atom and a material surface",
    ", the exact potential can be calculated for arbitrary distances , taking due account of finite response times of both atom and material medium , provided the surface reflection operator is known  @xcite .    by computing the reflection operator of the grating as a perturbation of the planar symmetry , refs .",
    "@xcite derived the casimir - polder potential to first order in the grating amplitude .",
    "the resulting expressions are valid only when the grating amplitude is the smallest length scale in the problem . however , in order to enhance the non - trivial geometry effects associated with the departure from the planar symmetry , it is of course interesting to have large amplitudes .",
    "this was indeed the case in the atom - surface @xcite and surface - surface @xcite experiments carried out so far . in this paper , we compute the exact reflection operator by applying the differential theory of diffraction gratings @xcite , and then deriving the exact casimir - polder potential from the scattering approach @xcite . our approach is similar to the theory developed in refs .",
    "@xcite for treating surface - surface interactions .",
    "non - perturbative results were previously obtained for a toy model describing the casimir interaction of a scalar field satisfying ideal dirichlet boundary conditions with a small sphere above a corrugated surface  @xcite . in this paper , we develop a full electromagnetic theory that takes into account the electromagnetic responses of real atoms and material surfaces ( we consider a rb atom above a si grating in the numerical examples ) .",
    "this allows us to cover the entire range of separation distances , from the unretarded short - distance van der waals regime to the casimir - polder large - distance asymptotic limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the formal results for the casimir energy which are applied in the numerical implementations discussed in sec . iii . sec .",
    "iv presents our concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric ground - state atom located at @xmath0 above a non - planar surface ( see fig .  [ system ] ) , corresponding to a profile function @xmath1 giving the local surface height with respect to a reference plane at @xmath2 it is convenient to develop the scattering formula in the plane - wave basis @xmath3 @xcite , where @xmath4 is the two - dimensional wave - vector component parallel to the @xmath5 plane , @xmath6 represents upward ( downward ) propagation direction and @xmath7 stands for polarization .",
    "we assume that the atom - surface separation distance @xmath8 is much larger than the atomic dimensions , allowing us to approximate the potential to first order in the atomic polarizability @xmath9 or , equivalently , to first order in the atomic reflection operator @xcite    @xmath10    with @xmath11 and @xmath12 representing the wave - vector @xmath13-component associated with the imaginary frequency @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is defined in terms of @xmath16 in the same way ) .",
    "@xmath17 are unit vectors corresponding to a given polarization basis ( to be chosen later in this section ) .     ]",
    "the zero - temperature casimir energy is then obtained by expanding the general scattering formula @xcite to first order in @xmath18 this corresponds to neglecting all multiple reflections between the atom and the surface ( reflection operator @xmath19 ) but the single round - trip containing one reflection by each one ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed derivation ) .",
    "the casimir potential is then written as an integral over the positive imaginary semi - axis in the complex frequency plane : @xmath20    an exact expression for the casimir - polder interaction energy between a ground - state atom and a generic surface can also be written in terms of an integral over real frequencies .",
    "once such an integral is computed with an appropriate choice of integration contour in the complex frequency plane , one recovers eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) , which is in terms of purely imaginary frequencies @xmath21 . on one hand ,",
    "the real frequency formalism suffers from highly oscillatory contributions , but allows for the identification of the relevant modes ( evanescent and propagating ) of the electromagnetic field that contribute to the interaction energy .",
    "for example , both modes are known to play a fundamental role in the casimir energy in the plane - plane geometry @xcite .",
    "we expect that both kinds of modes also have a key role in the casimir - polder atom - grating interaction ( this analysis is beyond the scope of the present paper ) . on the other hand",
    ", the formalism in terms of purely imaginary frequencies has a smooth , exponentially decaying frequency behavior , but it does not allow for the identification of the separate contributions from evanescent and propagating modes . however , eq .  ( [ interaction ] )",
    "does include the total contribution of all modes .    in this paper , we calculate the exact surface reflection operator @xmath19 for the rectangular ( lamellar ) grating shown in fig",

    "translational symmetry along the @xmath27 direction implies that @xmath19 does not change @xmath28 when defining the polarization basis , we exploit this symmetry as in waveguide theory : polarization h is such that @xmath29 with @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 given in terms of @xmath34 by using maxwell equations . for the electric field components at a real frequency @xmath35 propagating in a medium of dielectric constant @xmath36 , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 in vacuum ( @xmath39 ) , the corresponding unit vectors are then given by @xmath40 polarization e is likewise defined by the condition @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 so that the corresponding unit vectors are given by @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the surface profile is periodic along the @xmath45 direction , the fields are pseudo - periodic functions of @xmath45 ( bloch s theorem ) : @xmath46 for some @xmath47 in the first brillouin zone @xmath48.$ ] the wave - vector @xmath45-component of a given incident plane wave can always be cast in the form @xmath49 for some integer @xmath50 and @xmath51.$ ] diffraction by the periodic grating will give rise to new fourier components modulated by integer multiples of @xmath52 although these new fourier components correspond to different integers @xmath53 ( with @xmath54 representing a given diffraction order ) , they all correspond to the the same @xmath47 in the first brillouin zone according to bloch s theorem . for a given incident plane wave @xmath55 we add , in the homogenous region above the grating ( @xmath56 ) , a superposition of reflected plane waves @xmath57 ( rayleigh expansion ) , with amplitudes given by the matrix elements @xmath58 of the grating reflection operator . in the bulk region",
    "@xmath59 the dielectric constant is also uniform and the field is written as a simple plane wave expansion in terms of transmission amplitudes . on the other hand , within the inhomogeneous grating region @xmath60 we derive the non - trivial @xmath13 dependence of the field by solving coupled differential equations ( differential approach ) @xcite .",
    "we then solve for the matrix elements @xmath61 by matching the different field expansions at @xmath62 and @xmath2    the properties of the reflection operator @xmath19 discussed above allow us to simplify the general expression ( [ interaction ] ) for the casimir - polder potential energy . by plugging the result ( [ ratomic ] ) for the atomic reflection operator into ( [ interaction ] ) ,",
    "we find @xmath63 the sums over the brillouin zones @xmath50 and @xmath53 run from @xmath64 to @xmath65 the polarizations @xmath66 are either e or h and @xmath67 [ see eq .",

    "when evaluating ( [ final ] ) , we need to truncate the sum over the brillouin zones @xmath81 at some finite value @xmath82 so that the number of zones is @xmath83 the value of @xmath84 required for a given accuracy decreases with increasing distance @xmath85 because the factor @xmath86 kills the contribution of large values of @xmath50 and @xmath87 by comparing results obtained from different values of @xmath82 we found that @xmath88 was sufficient to achieve an accuracy at the level of a percent for the numerical examples considered below .",
    "it is instructive to compare our exact results with those obtained within the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) @xcite , which here corresponds to computing the potential @xmath89 for a given surface profile from the potential @xmath90 for a planar surface taken at the local atom - surface distance : @xmath91.$ ] for the rectangular grating considered here , deviations from pfa are quantified by the ratio @xmath92 when the atom is on top of a groove and by @xmath93 when the atom is on top of a plateau .     ]    in fig .",
    "[ plateau ] , we plot @xmath94 as a function of distance for an atom above the plateau midpoint @xmath95 and several different combinations of amplitude and period , with groove width @xmath96 we always find @xmath97 in qualitative agreement with pws , with the grooves making the potential less attractive than the potential of a homogeneous plane surface at @xmath98 when the atom is very far from the surface , @xmath99 it feels the corrugation as a very small perturbation of the plane symmetry and then the potential approaches the value for a planar surface ( @xmath100 ) . as the distance decreases , the departure from the plane geometry becomes increasingly important .",
    "the curves corresponding to the same ratio @xmath101 are close but do not coincide , as expected since non - geometric length scales associated to characteristic frequencies of the rb atom and the si bulk are also relevant . for large distances ,",
    "the dominant field frequencies are much smaller than the atom and medium characteristic frequencies , and then the potential is dominated by the instantaneous response associated to the zero - frequency polarizability and dielectric constant .",
    "thus , the potential depends only on the ratios between the geometric lengths @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 in this asymptotic limit . on the other hand , as the distance decreases ,",
    "finite response times of both atom and medium give rise to a richer scenario .",
    "the crossover between the long - distance casimir - polder and the unretarded van der waals regimes is in the range @xmath105 for a rb atom interacting with a si surface ( see for instance fig .  4 of ref .",
    "when the separation distance decreases below @xmath106 it already corresponds to the transition to the van der waals regime for @xmath107 but not yet for @xmath108 the values for @xmath107 then move away from the curve for @xmath109 and the same @xmath110 as shown in fig .  [ plateau ] . a similar effect , for @xmath111 and @xmath112 is also apparent in fig .  [ plateau ] .",
    "as @xmath94 approaches the pfa limit @xmath113 at shorter distances , the amplitude @xmath24 is no longer the most relevant length scale capturing the variation with distance . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ plateau ] , we plot @xmath94 as a function of @xmath114 which is directly related to the angular aperture @xmath115 $ ] of the plateau width as seen from the atom location above the plateau midpoint ( see diagram in fig .  [ plateau ] ) .",
    "when @xmath116 is very close to @xmath117 [ @xmath118 , we expect the effect of the border of the plateau to be negligible , and then the potential should be well approximated by the result for an infinite plane ( pfa ) . the inset of fig .",
    "[ plateau ] shows that the variable @xmath119 indeed captures the main effect behind the departure from pfa as the atom is displaced away from the surface , since the curves corresponding to different values of amplitude and period collapse near each other at short distances .",
    "for all different values of @xmath24 and @xmath103 shown in the figure , the point of maximum @xmath120 is near @xmath121 corresponding to an angular aperture @xmath122 the maximum @xmath120 depends mainly on @xmath101 and is larger for larger @xmath101 as expected .     ]",
    "when the atom is above the groove region , the potential is stronger than the potential for a planar surface at the bottom of the groove ( @xmath123 ) , again in qualitative agreement with the pws picture . in fig .",
    "[ groove ] , we plot @xmath94 as a function of distance for @xmath73 ( groove midpoint ) and @xmath96 the curves corresponding to different ( fixed ) values of @xmath24 and @xmath103 merge at distances @xmath124 this remarkable property was first found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the scalar casimir - polder model .",
    "it may be interpreted as an effect of averaging the small length scales associated to the surface profile when considering the long - wavelength field fluctuations that provide the main contribution at large distances .    at shorter distances ,",
    "the curves move apart following the order of larger @xmath125 although atomic / material frequency scales play a relevant role at @xmath126 the values for different @xmath24 and @xmath103 with the same @xmath101 shown in fig .",
    "[ groove ] are still relatively close .     ]    from an overall comparison of figs .  [ plateau ] and [ groove ]",
    ", we may conclude that the relative deviation from pfa @xmath127 is generally larger above the groove than above the plateau . in fig .",

    "pfa is also worse near the corner , but the variation of @xmath94 with lateral position is much smaller .     ]    at a given plane @xmath132 the potential profile along the @xmath45 axis is approximately sinusoidal for the relatively large distances considered here . in fig .",

    "[ plateau ] and [ groove ] ) .",
    "as the distance decreases , the major correction , corresponding to the first diffraction order @xmath137 produces a sinusoidal modulation with period @xmath138 deviation from the sinusoidal shape ( coming from @xmath139 ) is such that the lateral force stiffness @xmath140 is slightly larger at the groove midpoint than at the plateau midpoint , as shown in fig .",
    "[ variando_x]a .",

    "[ variando_x]a . while the average potential is closer to the asymptotic value @xmath150 in fig .",

    "[ variando_x]b ( larger @xmath119 ) .",
    "as the atom is displaced away from the surface , the potential becomes more sinusoidal and with a smaller amplitude . with the same parameters of fig .",
    "[ variando_x]b , the amplitude decreases by two and three orders of magnitude at @xmath151 and @xmath152 respectively .",
    "we have shown that pfa overestimates the potential strength above the plateau . as the atom is displaced away from surface , the deviation @xmath120 is mainly controlled by the parameter @xmath119 associated to the angular aperture of the plateau as seen by the atom .",
    "the maximum deviation takes place near @xmath153 and is larger for deeper grooves ( larger @xmath101 ) as expected . as the distance",
    "is increased past this value , the potential again approaches the result for a planar surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the potential is underestimated by the pfa above the groove .",
    "the deviation increases strongly as the atom is laterally displaced closer to a corner , where the presence of the ridge walls have a stronger effect .",
    "the naive pws picture of the casimir - polder interaction agrees qualitatively with several features found in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , pws typically underestimates the magnitude of the casimir - polder potential in the grating geometry @xcite , particularly in the non - perturbative regime considered here @xcite . for instance , it predicts an anisotropy of the casimir - polder potential far too small to nucleate vortices in a bose - einstein condensate by rotation of the grating , whereas the exact theory presented here predicts an anisotropy above the required values under realistic experimental conditions  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the contribution of higher diffraction orders to the potential is increasingly small as the distance increases , resulting in a sinusoidal variation along the transverse @xmath45 direction for @xmath154 ( aperture angle smaller than @xmath155 ) .    the scattering approach developed in this paper might be readily adapted to consider more general two - dimensional periodic patterns , like the pillars structure employed in the quantum reflection experiment reported by ref .",
    "recently , the casimir interaction between two material surfaces imprinted with two - dimensional periodic patterns has been analyzed in detail  @xcite .",
    "the method developed here thus paves the way for the quantitative analysis of a variety of interesting geometries with applications in enhanced atomic quantum reflection and diffraction .",
