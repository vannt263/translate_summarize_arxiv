    "we shall see later that a deviation of @xmath93 from @xmath94 corresponds to a violation of the response relation .      before proceeding to the interpretation of the right hand side of , we demonstrate straightforward conclusions of the extended jarzynski equality .",

    "reduces to @xmath97 which is an exact relation corresponding to the gibbs relation in equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "the equilibrium gibbs relation leads to potentials which describe macro- or mesoscopic forces .",
    "the equality , however , implies that we may not have such potentials in ness as @xmath98 is not necessarily described by a difference of a state function .      from jensen s inequality , we have @xmath99 , which implies @xmath100 where the equality holds in the quasi - static limit .",
    "we believe that this is a natural extension of the second law of thermodynamics to operations between ness .",
    "it is notable that the right - hand side involves a quantity in the reversed protocol @xmath88 .",
    "the inequality implies that the minimum work principle is not extended straightforwardly to ness .",
    "the quantity equated with the free energy difference is not the work but the sum of the work and @xmath101 .",

    "we define a dimensionless parameter indicating the degree of nonequilibrium by @xmath102 we here deal with systems with small @xmath103 and ignore the contribution of @xmath104 .",
    "let us now derive a compact approximate expression for the right - hand side of . from the definition of the modified expectation",
    ", we have @xmath105 by applying the cumulant expansion to the right - hand side and arranging the result by order , we have @xmath106 where @xmath107 is a truncated correlation , @xmath108 . from eqs .   and , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "substituting them into eq .  , we have @xmath111 where we have defined @xmath112    the equality in the steady protocol @xmath35 is approximated as @xmath113 ( to be precise , @xmath114 should be read @xmath115 ) , which leads to the well - known formula of the linear response relation ( lrr ) for heat currents @xcite . since @xmath116",
    ", we have @xmath117 with which eq .",
    "is transformed to the usual green - kubo formula for the steady current @xmath118 .",
    "it is notable that the modified expectation is regarded as a natural expectation from the point of the lrr .",
    "when there is an operation , the lrr is violated in general and @xmath119 does not vanish . we can thus interpret @xmath119 as the `` _ violation of lrr _ '' due to the external operation .",
    "more generally the equality @xmath120 in gives an exact response relation for @xmath121 because , by substituting eqs .   and",
    ", the equality is rewritten as a relation which connects @xmath121 to the higher cumulants of @xmath122 .",
    "similarly to the above argument up to @xmath115 , the deviation of @xmath93 from @xmath94 can be regarded as the violation of the exact response relation .",
    "we have thus reached the most important interpretation of the equality ; _ the mechanical work in ness is related to the violation of the response relation_.    in equilibrium operations at @xmath84 , we see that @xmath123 corresponds to the heat current induced by the external operation .",
    "this enables us to intuitively understand the role played by @xmath119 in a weak ness . in an equilibrium system",
    "the induced current @xmath124 requires no `` costs '' , and hence does not appear in thermodynamic relations . in a ness , on the other hand ,",
    "any heat current is coupled to the temperature difference .",
    "this is the reason that we have @xmath125 in our thermodynamic relation .",
    "we have derived nonequilibrium extensions of the jarzynski work relation , the gibbs relation , and the second law in a general classical model of heat conduction .",
    "although one can show that the gibbs relation approximated to @xmath115 coincides with the extended clausius relation that we have derived in @xcite , all the other results are novel .",
    "especially , it is fascinating that thermodynamic relations and response relations are coupled intrinsically in our relations .",
    "the traditional understanding has been that thermodynamic relations work for equilibrium operations , and response relations work for nonequilibrium steady states . here , by considering an operation for ness and proving the extended jarzynski equality",
    ", we have shown that the two paradigms are naturally unified in a single exact relation",
    ".    there has been many works on the violation of fluctuation - dissipation relation including an effective temperature for characterizing relaxation processes @xcite , the formula for estimating the energy dissipation @xcite , and the linear response around ness @xcite .",
    "it would be suggestive to look for possible relations of these topics with the present study .",
    "although we have restricted ourselves to the simplest setting here , it is straightforward to extend the present results to the case where the inverse temperatures @xmath3 and @xmath4 vary , or to other nonequilibrium systems . the only essential requirement is the detailed fluctuation theorem .",
    "last but not least let us stress that all of our main results , , and may be tested experimentally especially when the degree of nonequilibrium @xmath103 is small . although we still do not know whether these results have practical applications , it would be exciting to imagine applying the exact jarzynski equality to the analysis of the efficiency of a thermodynamic machine operating in ness .    the author thanks t. s. komatsu , s. sasa and h. tasaki for fruitful discussions and suggestions .",
