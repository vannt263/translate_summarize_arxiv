    "e , one of the hottest and most x - ray luminous galaxy clusters known , was discovered by tucker et al .",
    "it was first observed by  in october 2000 for 24 ks .",
    "that observation revealed a bullet - like , relatively cool subcluster just exiting the core of the main cluster , with a prominent bow shock ( markevitch et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter m02 ) .",
    "a comparison of the x - ray and optical images revealed a galaxy subcluster just ahead of the gas `` bullet '' , which led m02 to suggest that this unique system could be used to determine whether dark matter is collisional or collisionless , if only one could map the mass distribution in the subcluster .",
    "apart from the obvious interest for the still unknown nature of dark matter , the possibility of it having a nonzero self - interaction cross - section has far - reaching astrophysical implications ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ; for more discussion see  [ sec : disc ] below ) .",
    "just such a map of the dark matter distribution in e  has recently been obtained by clowe , gonzalez , & markevitch ( 2004 , hereafter c04 ) from weak lensing data .",
    "it reveals a dark matter clump coincident with the centroid of the galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img]_a _ ) .",
    "c04 also derived @xmath2 ratios of the main cluster and the subcluster and found them in agreement with each other and with other clusters values .",
    "in addition ,  re - observed e  for 70 ks in july 2002 , from which a more accurate estimate of the shock mach number was derived using the gas density jump at the shock , @xmath3 ( all uncertainties 68% ) , which corresponds to a shock ( and bullet subcluster ) velocity of @xmath4 ( markevitch et al .",
    ", in prep .",
    ", hereafter m04 ) .",
    "the new x - ray data also further clarified the geometry of the merger .    in this paper , we combine these new optical and x - ray data to constrain the self - interaction cross - section of dark matter particles .",
    "we use @xmath5 , @xmath6 , , for which @xmath7 kpc at the cluster redshift @xmath8 .",
    "( 0,14.9)(18.5,24.0 ) ( -0.5,24)=10.0 cm ( 8,24)=10.0 cm ( 1.7,23.0)a ( 10.2,23.0)b",
    "the dark matter collisional cross - section , @xmath9 , can be constrained from the e  data by at least three independent methods , using simple calculations described in the sections below .",
    "they are based on the observed gas ",
    "dark matter offset , the high subcluster velocity , and the subcluster survival .",
    "first , we give the main assumptions that will go into these calculations .",
    "there are two estimates of the total masses of the subcluster and the main cluster  from the galaxy velocity dispersion ( barrena et al .  2002 ) and from weak lensing ( c04 ) .",
    "given the disturbed state of this system , virial or hydrostatic mass estimates ( either from galaxy velocities or the gas temperature ) can be incorrect , and we chose to use the direct weak lensing measurements from c04 even though their formal statistical accuracy is poorer . the main cluster s lensing signal",
    "can be fit by a king mass profile @xmath10 with best - fit parameters @xmath11  and @xmath12 kpc ( c04 ) .",
    "these two parameters are degenerate so their individual error bars are not meaningful ; the quantity of interest to us is the central mass column density ( approximately proportional to @xmath13 ) , which is measured with a 16% accuracy .",
    "this mass profile is very close to the barrena et al .",
    "nfw profile at all radii outside the core . a king profile is marginally preferred over an nfw profile ( also acceptable statistically ) .",
    "the projected mass excess created by the subcluster is detected in the lensing data with a @xmath14 significance .",
    "the subcluster mass signal is detected to @xmath15 kpc from the mass ( or galaxy ) peak , beyond which the subcluster may be tidally stripped ( c04 ) .",
    "the lensing - derived subcluster mass ( @xmath16 ) is significantly higher than the barrena et al .",
    "estimate , but the latter result was based on only 7 galaxies and the equilibrium assumption , thus could easily be biased .",
    "the current lensing data accuracy is not sufficient to derive an exact mass distribution for the subcluster , but our estimates below are not particularly sensitive to it , being mostly determined by its overall projected mass . for the sake of modeling , we will adopt a king profile with @xmath17 kpc and @xmath18 , truncated at @xmath19 kpc , which adequately describes the lensing data .",
    "the subcluster is assumed to have passed ( once ) close to the center of the main cluster .",
    "this is supported by the x - ray image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : img]_b _ ) , the gas temperature map ( m04 ) and their comparison with the radio halo map ( govoni et al .  2004",
    "; liang et al .",
    "a cooler north - south bar in the x - ray image between the two dark matter clumps appears to be an edge - on pancake - like remnant of the merged main cluster s gas core and the subcluster s outer atmosphere ( stripped from what is now the gas bullet ) , suggesting that the subcluster has passed straight through the densest cluster region ( m04 ) .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity of the subcluster relative to the main cluster is about 600  ( barrena et al .",
    "2002 ) ; combined with the x - ray - measured mach number , it gives an angle of only @xmath20between the direction of motion and the plane of the sky .",
    "the sharpness of the shock front also confirms that the subcluster is presently moving very nearly in the plane of the sky ( m02 ) . from all the above",
    ", it is reasonable to assume that the subcluster has passed through the core of the main cluster .",
    "the accuracy of our qualitative cross - section estimates will be determined by the validity of this and other assumptions ( given below where relevant ) to a greater degree than by the measurement uncertainties , so below we will omit the measurement error propagation for clarity .      the most remarkable feature in fig .  [ fig : img]_b _ is a @xmath21 offset between the subcluster s dm centroid and the gas bullet , which is at least @xmath22-significant ( c04 ) . c04 use this fact as a direct proof of dark matter existence , as opposed to modified gravity hypotheses ( milgrom 1983 and later works ) in which one would expect the lensing mass peak to be associated with the gas  the dominant visible mass component . for our purposes",
    ", this offset means that the scattering depth of the dark matter subcluster w.r.t .",
    "collisions with the flow of dark matter particles can not be much greater than 1 .",
    "otherwise the dm subcluster would behave as a clump of fluid , experiencing stripping and drag deceleration , similar to that of the gas bullet ( assuming the same gas mass fraction in the main cluster and the subcluster ) , and there would be no offset between the gas and dark matter . the subcluster s scattering depth is @xmath23 where @xmath9 is the dm collision cross - section , @xmath24 is its particle mass , and @xmath25 is the dm mass surface density of the subcluster .",
    "the surface density averaged over the face of the subcluster within @xmath26 is @xmath27 . assuming spherical symmetry and requiring that @xmath28 , we obtain @xmath29 the surface density toward the subcluster center is several times higher , so by using an average we obtain a conservative upper limit .    another remarkable feature in fig .  [",
    "fig : img]_a _ is the coincidence of the subcluster s dm and galaxy centroids within their uncertainties ( c04 ) . to avoid an easily made mistake , we should note here that the subcluster galaxies , although effectively collisionless , do not give us the position at which the subcluster would be in the absence of the dm collisions .",
    "the galaxies are gravitationally bound to the dm clump and will be dragged back by it , should it experience any deceleration from the dm collisions .",
    "this can be taken into account , and a limit on the offset between the dm and galaxy centroids can indeed be used to derive an independent @xmath30 constraint ; however , it requires more accurate centroid positions than currently available .",
    "the observed velocity of the subcluster , @xmath31 , is in good agreement with the expected free - fall velocity onto the main cluster . for our main cluster s mass profile ,",
    "a small subcluster falling from a large distance should acquire 4400  at core passage , decelerating to 3500  at the current 0.66 mpc off - center distance of the subcluster .",
    "since the cluster peculiar velocities are small , such an agreement strongly suggests that the subcluster could not have lost much of its momentum to drag forces .",
    "drag is created by putative dm particle collisions , as well as the gravitational pull of the gas being stripped from the subcluster and of the tidally - stripped outer subcluster mass , and by dynamical friction as the moving subcluster disturbs the main cluster s matter distribution .",
    "we will conservatively disregard the latter three ( all of which are relatively small effects ) and assume , for a qualitative estimate , that the loss of velocity due to the dm collisions , compared to free fall , is less than 1000 , accumulated along the way through the main cluster .",
    "( 0,20.)(18.5,23.5 ) ( 0,24)=8.0 cm    we will now derive the drag force on the subcluster from the dm particle collisions .",
    "the subcluster will be decelerated by collisions when its particles acquire a momentum component opposite to the subcluster s velocity and then transfer all or part of it to the whole subcluster via gravitational interactions .",
    "we assume for simplicity that ( a ) dark matter particles have no peculiar velocities , and ( b ) the subcluster s gravity is felt by the particles , and vice versa , as long as the particle is within a fiducial radius @xmath32 of the subcluster ( the result will not depend qualitatively on @xmath33 in the range @xmath34 ) .",
    "we further assume that a particle transfers all of its momentum to the subcluster if its post - collision velocity is insufficient to escape beyond @xmath33 .",
    "faster - scattered particles retard the cluster only until they reach @xmath33 . the critical velocity that a subcluster particle needs to reach @xmath33 , mass - averaged ( in the _ rms _ sense ) over the subcluster mass profile , is @xmath35 .",
    "use of this average value lets us make a further simplifying assumption that all collisions occur at the subcluster center .",
    "we also conservatively disregard multiple scattering in the subcluster ; the adequacy of this assumption will be addressed below .",
    "an elastic collision of two equal - mass particles proceeds as shown in fig.[fig : diagram ] . in the subcluster s reference frame ,",
    "particle 2 is at rest and particle 1 , in the incoming flow , collides with it with a velocity @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the subcluster s velocity and the relatively small increase is because of the subcluster s gravitational pull within @xmath38 .",
    "particle 1 scatters at an angle @xmath39 with a velocity @xmath40 , while particle 2 acquires a velocity @xmath41 at an angle @xmath42 . from energy and momentum conservation , @xmath43 and",
    "the velocities are @xmath44    as a result of each collision , the subcluster acquires a net momentum along the @xmath45 direction , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 comes from the infalling particle ( which carries back exactly @xmath48 if it passes through the subcluster without scattering ) , and @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) comes from the respective outbound particle . if @xmath51 then @xmath52 ( the particle transfers all its momentum to the subcluster ) , while for @xmath53 , @xmath54 \\cos\\alpha_i .",

    "for example , for rigid spheres with radius @xmath63 ( for which the scattering cross - section is @xmath65 , landau & lifshitz 1958 ) , the scattering is isotropic if @xmath66 note that if the dm particles are wimps with the currently favored mass ( @xmath67 gev , hagiwara et al .",

    "our conclusions will be directly comparable to other astrophysical cross - section measurements which also implicitly assume isotropic scattering .",

    "we also note that the subcluster s @xmath2 ratios derived by c04 represent lower bounds on the true values ( because of possible projection and the particular technique employed to derive the subcluster mass ) , which makes our constraint conservative .    for cross - sections such as ( [ eq : cross2 ] ) and the subcluster s observed mass and radius , the mean scattering depth of the subcluster is @xmath109 .",
    "thus our single - scattering assumption is reasonable as a first approximation .",
    "if one considers a possibility that the escaping particle may expel another subcluster particle , the probability ( [ eq : chitau ] ) is a conservative underestimate . in ",

    "inclusion of multiple scattering would lead to tighter limits , but requires detailed knowledge of the matter distribution inside the subcluster and is not warranted by the present data .",
    "from the above order - of - magnitude estimates , the most promising way of improving the limit on ( or measuring ) the dm collision cross - section using e  would be to refine the weak lensing mass map and limit ( or detect ) the mass loss from the subcluster core . indeed ,",
    "if it had lost a significant fraction of its dm particles , they should form a tail detectable in the dark matter map , not unlike the x - ray gas tail .",
    "this tail would , of course , be in addition to the matter tidally stripped from the subcluster and a gravitational wake discussed by furlanetto & loeb ( 2002 ) .",
    "the main cluster s dm particles also would be scattered , probably resulting in additional detectable effects in the mass map .",
    "these considerations , along with the conservative assumptions that we made throughout to simplify calculations , suggest that the best way to proceed with the data interpretation is a detailed hydrodynamic simulation of this merger , such as that performed by tormen , moscardini , & yoshida ( 2003 ) but with the inclusion of collisionless galaxies and collisional dm with various cross - sections , followed by comparison of the results with the x - ray , optical and lensing data .",
    "the nature of dark matter is still a great unsolved astrophysical problem .",
    "laboratory searches for the dm candidates succeeded in showing that any interaction between the dark and baryonic matter is vanishingly small , with cross - sections many orders of magnitude lower than the values we consider in this work ( e.g. , bernabei et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) . despite their size ,",
    "galaxy clusters have an average projected mass density of order @xmath111 , so they are no match for the laboratory experiments for constraining the dm - baryon interactions .",
    "however , clusters and galaxies may provide the best available laboratory for studying the dm self - interaction .    while the common wisdom holds that dm is collisionless , a hypothesis of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) with cross - sections of order @xmath112  was most recently proposed by spergel & steinhardt ( 2000 ) to alleviate several apparent problems of the collisionless cdm model , such as the non - observation of predicted cuspy mass profiles in galaxies ( e.g. , moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ; cf .",
    "navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ; moore et al .  1999b ) and over - prediction of small sub - halos within the larger systems ( e.g. , klypin et al .",
    "1999 ; moore et al .",
    "simulations and theoretical studies ( e.g. , dav et al .  2001 ; ahn & shapiro 2002 ) narrowed the range required to explain the galaxy profiles to @xmath113  and pointed out that fluid - like dm with @xmath114  is another possibility .",
    "several observational constraints have been reported .",
    "gnedin & ostriker ( 2001 ; see also hennawi & ostriker 2002 ) pointed out that unless @xmath115 , galactic halos inside clusters should evaporate on the hubble timescale , because of collisional heat conduction from the hot cluster dm particles into the cool halos .",
    "we note that our constraint in  [ sec : surviv ] uses a very similar idea , except that we have a cluster - sized halo subjected to a flow of particles from one direction instead of random bombardment .",
    "furlanetto & loeb ( 2002 ) proposed to use the different shapes of a gravitational wake that a subcluster halo moving through a bigger halo would create in the collisionless and fluid - like dm models .",
    "they argue that the x - ray image of the bright galaxy in the fornax cluster already disfavors fluid - like dm .",
    "their method is somewhat similar to our e  estimates in that it also uses the motion of a halo within a bigger halo , but appears more observationally challenging .",

    "strong constraints are reported from the galaxy cluster cores .",
    "yoshida et al .  ( 2000 ) simulated evolution of a cluster for @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120  and obtained systematically flatter radial mass profiles for higher @xmath30 .",
    "using  x - ray data and the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , arabadjis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived a mass profile for the cluster ms1358 + 62 that is strongly centrally peaked ( in fact , more peaked than even the collisionless simulations predict ) . from the comparison with yoshida et al .",

    "more importantly , yoshida et al .",
    "present time evolution of their simulated cluster profile for @xmath118 , which at different epochs covers a range of shapes comparable to the whole difference between their 0.1 and 10 simulations ( see also hennawi & ostriker 2002 ) .",
    "this suggests that for a high @xmath30 , one expects a variety of cluster mass profiles  and indeed , while many real - world clusters exhibit peaked profiles , a large fraction has flat cores ( e.g. , coma ) .",
    "therefore , a sample of cluster profiles is required for such studies .",
    "miralda - escud ( 2002 ) used lensing data for the cluster ms213723 to show that its central mass distribution is elliptical , and concluded that @xmath122 , since otherwise dm collisions would erase ellipticity .",
    "again , this interpretation may not be unique , because ellipticity may be affected by line - of - sight projections .",
    "this ambiguity is illustrated by the fact that sand et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , using lensing data for the same cluster but considering the flatness of the central mass distribution instead of its ellipticity , arrived at the opposite conclusion .    while the above methods may eventually provide more sensitive constraints on @xmath30 than we have obtained , they require a statistical sample of clusters and cosmological simulations to reach solid conclusions . in comparison ,",
    "the unique geometry of the e  cluster merger allows us to see directly the ( cumulative ) results of single dm particle collisions , which makes the resulting limits quite robust .",
    "finally , we note that our limit , @xmath0 , excludes most of the @xmath1  interval proposed to explain the flat mass profiles in galaxies . within the sidm paradigm ,",
    "the galaxy profiles and the tight cross - section limits coming from clusters can still be reconciled if the cross - section were velocity - dependent , so that it would be smaller on average in clusters than in galaxies ( e.g. , firmani et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; hennawi & ostriker 2002 ; coln et al .",
    "however , it is difficult to justify this additional degree of freedom in the model until a nonzero cross - section is detected at any velocity .",
