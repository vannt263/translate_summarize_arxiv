    "historically , the coherent optical effects found their acoustic analogues after a while .",
    "such a correspondence is easily traced , for instance , in the case of the self - induced transparency ( sit ) phenomenon . its discovery in 1967 @xcite and theoretical explanation in 1969 @xcite stimulated a search for the acoustic analogue .",
    "the experimental observation at the liquid helium temperature of the acoustic self - induced transparency ( asit ) of the longitudinal hypersound in cubic crystal @xmath1 containing paramagnetic ions @xmath2 and @xmath3 was carried out in 1970 by shiren @xcite , who gave also the theoretical consideration of this effect .",
    "independently , asit was studied theoretically for transverse hypersound in a system of paramagnetic impurities with effective spin @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "soon after that , this effect was successfully revealed in a crystal @xmath5 alloyed by ions @xmath2 @xcite .    despite the existence of the optical - acoustic analogies mentioned above",
    ", the acoustic coherent effects do not appear as the exact copies of optical ones .",
    "obviously , the quantitative differences connected with a great distinction of the light and sound velocities or the frequencies of the electric - dipole and spin - phonon transitions take place .",
    "it should be stressed that the qualitative differences exist there .",
    "thus , the optical wave is especially transverse whereas the acoustic one has the longitudinal - transverse structure .",
    "the interaction between transverse and longitudinal components of the acoustic pulse in a crystal without anharmonicity of the lattice modes happens due to a presence of paramagnetic impurities .",
    "its influence on the dynamics of the components is inessential , if the linear velocities of acoustic waves differ significantly , as it takes place in the most solids .",
    "however , the linear velocities of transverse and longitudinal sounds are close in the ion crystals of halogenide of alkaline metals @xcite .",
    "since the components of the strain field interact effectively in this case , new features of their dynamics have to be expected .",
    "indeed , new mode of the resonant acoustic transparency has been revealed theoretically in ref .  .",
    "the propagation of the transverse - longitudinal elastic pulses in this mode is accompanied by trapping of the population of the spin sublevels . nevertheless , the deceleration in the velocity of the pulses is comparable to that in the case of asit of especially longitudinal or transverse hypersound @xcite .",
    "the theoretical considerations of the nonlinear dynamics of transverse - longitudinal acoustic pulses were fulfilled basically for the paramagnetic ions with effective spin @xmath4 @xcite . at the same time , it is well - known that the strongest interaction with the crystal lattice oscillations takes place in the case @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "since the spin - phonon interaction is greater here on two or three orders than for @xmath4 , the investigation of acoustic transparency of transverse - longitudinal pulses in a system of paramagnetic impurities with effective spin @xmath0 is more preferable from the point of view of experimental testing .",
    "the resonant modes of propagation of the transverse - longitudinal hypersound in direction parallel to external magnetic field and an axis of symmetry of the fourth order of the paramagnetic crystal with @xmath0 have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that these modes coincide with ones discussed in ref .  .",
    "the distinctive feature of the geometry considered there is that the roles of transverse and longitudinal components of the acoustic pulses are strictly various : the former component excites the spin - phonon transitions in the zeeman triplet , the latter one causes the dynamic shifts of the frequencies of these transitions .",
    "recently , it has been shown in the case of especially longitudinal acoustic pulses propagating under arbitrary angle with respect to an axis of the symmetry of the paramagnetic crystal , that both functions can be carried out by a single component of the strain field @xcite . in this connection",
    ", the studying of the nonlinear modes of the acoustic transparency for the transverse - longitudinal pulses that propagate in a system of the effective spins @xmath0 under arbitrary direction to the symmetry axis is of great interest .",
    "the present report is devoted to allocating these modes .",
    "following to ref .  , we suppose here that the external magnetic field is absent , and splitting of the energy sublevels is created by the static deformation of the paramagnetic crystal . for this reason",
    ", the degeneration of the spin states is removed incompletely in contrast to usual asit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system of material and wave equations describing the interaction in the strained crystal of the transverse - longitudinal elastic pulses with the paramagnetic impurities having effective spin @xmath0 is derived .",
    "we use the semi - classical approach , i.e. , the dynamics of the acoustic fields is assumed to obey the classical hamilton equations for the continuous medium , but the spin subsystem is treated as a quantum object .",
    "the order of the derivatives in the wave equations on the strain field components is reduced with the help of the unidirectional propagation ( up ) approximation . in section iii , the approximation of slowly varying envelopes ( sve ) is applied to the particular case of the system obtained in the previous section .",
    "it is shown that the evolution of the acoustic pulses in the paramagnetic crystal is governed by the well - studied equations of the long / short - wave coupling ( lswc ) @xcite .",
    "the pulse solutions decreasing exponentially and rationally of the lswc equations are presented in section iv .",
    "these solutions are exploited to classify the modes of the acoustic transparency of transverse - longitudinal pulses in the deformed paramagnetic crystal .",

    ". however , these modes are essentially different in terms of behavior of the paramagnetic impurities . whereas they are strongly excited as the soliton described by ( [ se_f ] ) propagates through crystal ,",
    "no significant excitation is caused in the case of ( [ pnt ] ) .",
    "indeed , since the effective detuning @xmath140 of the pulse described by eqs .",
    "( [ pnt ] ) is @xmath218 at its center , it is not resonant with the paramagnetic impurities on average over the pulse length .",
    "however , according to ( [ nnt ] ) and ( [ pnt ] ) , the excitation of the paramagnetic impurities at @xmath219 being relatively weak , is still stronger than that at @xmath214 .",
    "the reason is that the effective detuning decreases toward the pulse center when @xmath219 , owing to the component @xmath112 , and increases when @xmath214 .",
    "thus , a comparison of ( [ nnt ] ) with ( [ pnt ] ) demonstrates obvious asymmetry with respect to detuning of @xmath111 . since @xmath213 for the pulses described by ( [ nnt ] ) and @xmath166 for ones described by ( [ pnt ] )",
    ", we refer to the corresponding modes as acoustic negative and positive nonresonant transparency ( annt and apnt ) , respectively .    if @xmath208 and @xmath220 ( detuning is small ) , then eqs .",
    "( [ o_t])([v_g ] ) lead to expressions identical to those found in ref .  :",
    "@xmath221 the expression for group velocity coincides with one given in eqs .",
    "( [ se_f_a ] ) corresponding to the asit mode .    here",
    ", we have @xmath222 in the center of the pulse .",
    "the paramagnetic impurities are not excited , since the effective detuning is large , @xmath223 .",
    "however , the propagation velocity decreases as in the case of strong excitation at @xmath224 .",
    "such a deceleration of the pulse is explained by the dispersion properties of medium within the higher - frequency component bandwidth . according to @xcite , where this effect was studied in details for the optical solitons , we call the mode considered an acoustic extraordinary transparency ( aeot ) .",
    "the roles of the ordinary and extraordinary pulse components are played here by @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "the existence of this mode for transverse - longitudinal acoustic pulses has been revealed also in the case , when the splitting of the spin sublevels is produced by the external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the domains of existence of the modes with @xmath208 are presented in fig .",
    "it should be noted that expressions ( [ o_t])([v_g ] ) do not change their form in a presence of detuning between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the influence of this detuning is inessential if condition @xmath225 is valid . substituting the definitions for @xmath226 and @xmath227 into ( [ v_g ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath228 taking for @xmath2:@xmath1 @xcite @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 , we find @xmath236 .",
    "this estimation shows that we can neglect detuning between the linear velocities of transverse and longitudinal acoustic waves for typical values of the asit parameters .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the soliton modes of the acoustic transparency in a strained cubic crystal containing the resonant paramagnetic impurities with effective spin @xmath0 .",
    "it is supposed that the linear velocities of transverse and longitudinal sound are close , and the pulses propagate through the crystal under arbitrary angle with respect to the direction of external deformation parallel to the fourth - order symmetry axis .",
    "we have allocated five modes of acoustic transparency , which differ by the propagation velocity of the transverse - longitudinal pulses and degree of excitation of the paramagnetic impurities ( see table  i ) .",
    ".characteristics of the modes of acoustic transparency [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the acoustic self - induced transparency is characterized by strong excitation and substantial deceleration in the pulse propagation velocity relative to linear velocities .",
    "self - induced supertransparency differs from asit in that the decrease of velocity is small , but the paramagnetic impurities are strongly excited as well .",
    "the solitons of asist have larger amplitudes and smaller lengths as compared to asit solitons , and their high - frequency spectral components are strongly modulated . the carrier frequency of the transverse and longitudinal components in this mode is lower than the resonant frequency . the modes , in which the trapping of the populations of the spin sublevels takes place , are also identified .",
    "the pulses propagating in the acoustic extraordinary transparency mode are characterized by small detuning of the high - frequency components and dominant role of the zero - frequency ones .",
    "their group velocity substantially changes and may become comparable to that of pulses in asit and asist modes . in the acoustic positive and negative nonresonant transparency modes , the pulse velocity changes insignificantly , and the absolute value of detuning is large .",
    "the most substantial difference between these modes concerns the behavior of the effective detuning of the high - frequency components . in the annt mode",
    ", it remains virtually constant .",
    "if a pulse propagates in the apnt mode , then the effective detuning changes sign due to an influence of the zero - frequency component .",
    "since the local frequency passes through a resonance , a slightly stronger excitation occurs in this case , and the pulses are sharply peaked , as in the asist mode .    in this study",
    ", we ignored inhomogeneous broadening of the spin sublevels . an investigation allowing for this effect may throw light on the pulse area theorem , providing a basis for analysis of the stability of the transverse - longitudinal acoustic pulses .",
    "also , it would be interesting to identify the distinctive features of the dynamics of picosecond transverse - longitudinal acoustic pulses in a system of effective spins @xmath0 . unlike the present consideration , the sve approximation is inapplicable to this case .",
