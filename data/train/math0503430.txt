    "let @xmath1 be a smooth and oriented @xmath2-real submanifold of some @xmath3-complex manifold @xmath4 .",
    "a natural question arises , whether @xmath1 is the boundary of an ( @xmath5)-complex analytic subvariety of @xmath4 .",
    "this problem , the so - called _ boundary problem _ , has been widely treated over the past fifty years when @xmath1 is compact and @xmath4 is @xmath0 or @xmath6 .",
    "the case when @xmath1 is a compact , connected curve in @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , has been first solved by wermer  @xcite in 1958 .",
    "later on , in 1975 , harvey and lawson in  @xcite and  @xcite solved the boundary problem in @xmath0 and then in @xmath9 , in terms of holomorphic chains , for any @xmath10 .",
    "the boundary problem in @xmath6 was studied by dolbeault and henkin , in  @xcite for @xmath8 and in  @xcite for any @xmath10 . moreover , in these two papers the boundary problem is dealt with also for closed submanifolds ( with negligible singularities ) contained in @xmath11-concave ( i.e.  union of @xmath12 s ) open subsets of @xmath6 .",
    "this allows @xmath1 to be non compact .",
    "the results in  @xcite and  @xcite were extended by dinh in  @xcite .",
    "the main theorem proved by harvey and lawson in  @xcite is that if @xmath13 is compact and maximally complex then @xmath1 is the boundary of a unique holomorphic chain of finite mass  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 8.1 ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath1 is contained in the boundary @xmath14 of a strictly pseudoconvex domain @xmath15 then @xmath1 is the boundary of a complex analytic subvariety of @xmath15 , with isolated singularities  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to generalize this last result to a non compact , connected , closed and maximally complex submanifold @xmath1 of the connected boundary @xmath14 of an unbounded weakly pseudoconvex domain @xmath16 .",
    "the pseudoconvexity of @xmath15 is needed both for the local result and to prove that the singularities are isolated .",
    "maximal complexity of @xmath1 and extension theorem for @xmath17 functions ( see @xcite ) allow us to prove the following semi global result ( see corollary  [ l4 ] ) .",
    "assume that @xmath18 , @xmath19 and the levi form @xmath20 of @xmath21 has at least @xmath22 positive eigenvalues at every point @xmath23",
    ". then    1 .",
    "there exist a tubular open neighborhood @xmath24 of @xmath14 and a complex submanifold @xmath25 of @xmath26 with boundary , such that @xmath27 , i.e. a complex manifold @xmath28 such that the closure @xmath29 of @xmath25 in @xmath24 is a smooth submanifold with boundary @xmath1 .",
    "a very simple example ( see example  [ e1 ] ) shows that in general the semi global result fails to be true for @xmath8 .    in order to prove that @xmath25 extends to a complex analytic subvariety @xmath30 of @xmath15 with boundary @xmath1 we first treat the case when @xmath15 is convex and does not contain straight lines",
    "this is the crucial step . for technical reasons we divide the proof in two cases : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we cut @xmath33 by a family of real hyperplanes @xmath34 which intersect @xmath1 along smooth compact submanifolds .",
    "then the natural foliation on each @xmath34 by complex hyperplanes induces on @xmath35 a foliation by compact maximally complex ( @xmath36)-real manifolds @xmath37 .",
    "thus a natural way to proceed is to apply harvey - lawson s theorem to each @xmath37 and to show that the family @xmath38 of the corresponding harvey - lawson solutions actually organizes in a complex analytic subvariety @xmath30 , giving the desired extension ( see theorem  [ mt ] ) .",
    "this is done by following an idea of zaitsev ( see lemma [ zaitsev ] ) .",
    "the same method of proof is used in the last section in order to treat the problem when @xmath15 is pseudoconvex . in this case , @xmath1 is requested to fulfill an additional condition . precisely ,    1 .",
    "if @xmath39 denotes the closure of @xmath40 in @xmath6 , then there exists an algebraic hypersurface @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "equivalently    1 .",
    "there exists a polynomial @xmath43 $ ] such that @xmath44    a similar condition was first pointed out by lupacciolu  @xcite in studying the extension problem for @xmath17 functions in unbounded domains .",
    "it allows us to build a nice family of hypersurfaces , which play the role of the hyperplanes in the convex case , and so to prove the main theorem of the paper : [ gt ] let @xmath45 be an unbounded domain in @xmath0 @xmath46 with smooth boundary @xmath21 and @xmath1 be a maximally complex closed @xmath2-real submanifold @xmath47 of @xmath21 .",
    "assume that    1 .",

    "@xmath1 satisfies condition @xmath49 .",
    "then there exists a unique @xmath50-complex analytic subvariety @xmath30 of @xmath45 , such that @xmath51 .",
    "moreover the singular locus of @xmath30 is discrete and the closure of @xmath30 in @xmath52 is a smooth submanifold with boundary @xmath1 .",
    "we do not deal with the 1-dimensional case .",
    "there are two different kinds of difficulties .",
    "first of all , a semi global strip as in corollary  [ l4 ] may not exist ( see example  [ e1 ] ) .",
    "secondly , even though it does exist , it could be non extendable to the whole @xmath15 ( see example  [ e2 ] ) and it is not clear at all how it is possible to generalize the _",
    "moments condition _",
    "( see  @xcite ) .",
    "another similar approach can be followed to treat the _ semi - local _ boundary problem , i.e. given an open subset @xmath53 of the boundary of @xmath45 , find an open subset @xmath54 such that , for any maximally complex submanifold @xmath55 , there exists a complex subvariety @xmath30 of @xmath56 whose boundary is @xmath1 .",
    "we deal with this problem in a work in preparation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we briefly recall some well known notions of @xmath17 geometry that will be used in the paper .",
    "let @xmath57 be a smooth connected real submanifold , and let @xmath58 .",
    "we denote by @xmath59 the tangent space of @xmath60 at the point @xmath61 , and by @xmath62 the holomorphic tangent space of @xmath60 at the point @xmath61 .    a ( @xmath63)-real submanifold @xmath57 , @xmath64 ,",

    "when this is the case , @xmath66 is a subbundle of the tangent bundle @xmath67 .",

    "finally we observe that the boundary @xmath1 of a complex submanifold @xmath30 with @xmath77 is maximally complex . indeed , for any @xmath78 , @xmath79 is a real hyperplane of @xmath80 and so is @xmath81 .",
    "hence @xmath82 is of real codimension @xmath83 in @xmath84 .    if @xmath85 and @xmath86 is compact then for any holomorphic @xmath87-form @xmath88 we have @xmath89 since @xmath90 .",

    "consequently we may extend @xmath229 to @xmath332 by @xmath333 .",
    "it follows that , defining @xmath334 @xmath221 is the desired extension of @xmath229 to @xmath222 . in order to conclude the proof we have to show that @xmath335 has isolated singularities",

    "we prove now the statement of proposition  [ p ] for @xmath32 .",
    "our first step is to show that when we slice transversally @xmath60 with complex hyperplanes , we obtain @xmath339-real submanifolds which satisfy the moments condition .",
    "again , we fix our attention to a neighborhood of the form @xmath238 . in @xmath256 , with coordinates @xmath357 , we choose an arbitrary holomorphic @xmath87-form which is constant with respect to @xmath246",

    "we need to prove that for any simple curve @xmath359 , @xmath360 , @xmath361 applying stoke s theorem , we have @xmath362 the last equality is due to the fact that @xmath363 is maximally complex and thus supports only @xmath364 and @xmath365-forms , while @xmath366 is a @xmath367-form .",
    "now we can prove proposition  [ p ] and theorem  [ mt ] also when @xmath32 .",
    "we can find a countable covering of @xmath222 made of open subsets @xmath368 in such a way that :    1 .",

    "each slice of @xmath60 in @xmath375 is maximally complex , and so are @xmath380 and @xmath381 , for @xmath382 sufficiently near to @xmath372 ( because they are in @xmath375 as well ) .",
    "now we use lemma  [ omeol ] with @xmath383 .",
    "what we have just observed implies that , for all holomorphic @xmath87-form @xmath166 , @xmath384 vanishes in an open subset of @xmath53 and so is identically zero on @xmath53 .",
    "this implies that all slices in @xmath385 are maximally complex .",
    "again we may apply harvey - lawson s theorem slice by slice and conclude by the methods of proposition  [ p ] .",
    "we have already observed that if @xmath1 is one - dimensional the local extension inside @xmath45 may not exist ( see example  [ e1 ] ) .",

    "[ e2]using the notation of proposition  [ p ] , in @xmath386 let @xmath224 and @xmath387 be the balls @xmath388    consider the connected irreducible analytic set of codimension one @xmath389 and its restriction @xmath390 to @xmath391 . if @xmath390 has two connected components , @xmath392 and @xmath393 , when we try to extend @xmath392 ( analytic set of codimension one on @xmath391 ) to @xmath222 , its restriction to @xmath391 will contain also @xmath393 .",
    "so @xmath392 is an analytic set of codimension one on @xmath391 that does not extend on @xmath222 .",

    "a point of @xmath229 ( of @xmath390 ) can be written as @xmath394 , @xmath395 , with @xmath396 and @xmath397 .",
    "hence , points in @xmath390 satisfy @xmath398 since @xmath399 is monotone decreasing up to @xmath400 ( where @xmath401 ) , and then monotone increasing , there exist @xmath402 and @xmath403 such that the inequalities are satisfied when @xmath404 , or when @xmath405 .",
    "@xmath390 is thus the union of the two disjoint open sets @xmath406",
    "we may now prove    let @xmath45 be an unbounded domain in @xmath0 @xmath407 with smooth boundary @xmath21 and @xmath1 be a maximally complex closed @xmath2-real submanifold @xmath47 of @xmath21 .",

    "the only thing we have to show in order to conclude the proof ( by using the methods of the previous section ) is that , up to a holomorphic change of coordinates and a holomorphic embedding @xmath412 , we can choose a sequence of real hyperplanes @xmath413 , @xmath414 , which are exhaustive in the following sense :    * @xmath415 is compact , for all @xmath414 ; * one of the two halfspaces in which @xmath416 divides @xmath417 , say @xmath418 , intersects @xmath419 in a relatively compact set ; * @xmath420 .",
    "the arguments of proposition [ p ] , indeed excluded the proof that the singularities are isolated depend only on the fact that we can cut @xmath1 by complex hyperplanes , obtaining compact maximally complex submanifolds .",
    "once we have found @xmath421 ( @xmath422 is in fact contained in @xmath423 by analytic continuation , since it has to coincide with the strip in a neighborhood of @xmath1 ) , we set @xmath424 .",

    "so , in each @xmath211 we can suppose that we deal with a strongly pseudoconvex open set , and thus the proof of the fact that the singularities are isolated is the same as in proposition [ p ] .    following  @xcite we divide the proof in two steps .",
    "_ step 1_. @xmath427 linear .",
    "we consider @xmath428 , which is disjoint from @xmath429 .",

    "let @xmath434 be a real hyperplane .",
    "the intersection between @xmath92 and a translated of @xmath435 is either empty or compact . for all @xmath436 ,",
    "there exist a real hyperplane @xmath437 , intersecting @xmath45 , and a small translated @xmath438 such that @xmath439 .",
    "since @xmath440 , and @xmath45 is a countable union of compact sets , we may choose an exhaustive sequence @xmath416 .",
    "_ step 2_. @xmath427 generic .",
    "we use the veronese map @xmath232 to embed @xmath6 in a suitable @xmath441 in such a way that @xmath442 , where @xmath443 is a linear subspace .",
