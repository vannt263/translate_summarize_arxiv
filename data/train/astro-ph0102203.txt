    "we use the unified treatment of total electron ion recombination of nahar and pradhan ( 1992 , 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the method involves large scale computations in the close coupling ( cc ) approximation using the r - matrix method to ( i ) provide recombination rate coefficients that are fully consistent with the photoionization cross sections of the ion , which allows , for example , precise calculations of ionization balance , and ( ii ) treat nonresonant radiative and resonant dielectronic recombination in a self - consistent , unified manner , as explained in the first paper of the series ( nahar & pradhan 1997 ) .",
    "present results are the first detailed @xmath5 for recombination of ni ii .    state specific recombination rate coefficients for 532 bound states of ni ii are presented .",
    "these are obtained from the _ partial _ photoionization cross sections including autoionizing resonances .",
    "the partial cross sections correspond to photoionization leaving the residual core in its ground state .",
    "the calculations are carried out in the close coupling approximation using the r - matrix method essentially as in the opacity project ( seaton 1987 , seaton et al .",
    "the theoretical details for photoionization cross sections for ni ii can be found in bautista ( 1999 ) .",
    "the theory of unified treatment for total electron - ion recombination in the cc approximation is briefly outlined .",
    "the treatment considers the infinite number of states of the recombined ion and incorporates both the radiative recombination ( rr ) and the dielectronic recombination ( dr ) processes in a self - consistent , unified manner .",
    "details of the method are given in nahar and pradhan ( 1994 , 1995 ) and in previous papers in the present series .",
    "in the cc approximation the total wavefunction expansion , @xmath6 , of the recombined ion , ( n+1 ) electron system , is expanded in terms of the target ( recombining ion ) wavefunctions as :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the target wavefunction in a specific state @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the wavefunction for the ( n+1)th electron in a channel labeled as @xmath11 ; @xmath12 being its kinetic energy .",

    "the _ partial _ photoionization cross sections leaving the core in the ground state are obtained for all these bound states .",
    "the recombination cross sections , @xmath17 , are then obtained from the photoionization cross sections , @xmath18 , through principle of detailed balance :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the statistical weight factors of the recombining and recombined states respectively , @xmath22 is velocity of the photoelectron , and @xmath23 is the photon frequency . the recombination rate coefficient , @xmath5 , at a given temperature is obtained by averaging @xmath24 over the maxwellian distribution of electrons , @xmath25 , as ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is photoelectron energy , @xmath28 is the photon energy and @xmath29 is the ionization potential . as photoionization cross sections include the detailed structures of autoionizing resonances , the sum of individual rates of the bound states corresponds to inclusion of both the rr and the dr in a unified manner .",

    "the outer electron interacts weakly with the core which decays through emission of a photon . as the photon energy approaches the excited core threshold , autoionization rate decreases as @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the effective quantum number of the rydberg series belonging to the converging threshold ) while the radiative decay process increases by the same order .",
    "these states are treated through precise dr theory by bell & seaton ( 1985 ) as extended in nahar & pradhan ( 1994 ) to obtain the dr collision strengths , @xmath33 .",

    "the largest number of channels was 136 and the largest hamiltonian matrix size was 2055 @xmath52 2055 .    on the other hand the calculation of dr collision strengths , @xmath33 , in the small energy region below the core thresholds , @xmath53 , required less computational time ( @xmath54 40 cpu hours in total ) as no dipole matrix elements needed to be computed .    the non - resonant background contributions from the high - n group ( b ) states to the total recombination is also included through a `` top - up '' scheme as explained in nahar ( 1996 ) .",
    "this contribution is significant at low temperatures .",
    "the results of present calculations for ni ii and comparison with previous data are described in subsections below .",
    "partial photoionization cross sections ( @xmath18 ) leaving the core in the ground state are obtained for 532 bound states of ni ii .",
    "( the _ total _ cross sections are reported in bautista ( 1999 ) . )",
    "the cross sections exhibit extensive autoionizing resonances that enhance the overall photoionization rates considerably .",
    "state specific recombination rate coefficients are obtained from the partial photoionization cross sections . the percentage contributions and relative weight of individual bound states to the total @xmath55 varies with temperature due to resonance structures and enhancement in the background cross sections at different energies .",
    "some important features of photoionization cross sections related to recombination are illustrated in figs .",
    "1 and 2 .    fig .",
    "1 presents @xmath18 of five states .",
    "the ground state of ni  ii is an equivalent electron state , @xmath56 , and is one of the dominant contributors at all temperatures because of its relatively large background photoionization cross sections even at high photon energies , as seen in the top panel , fig .",
    "the state also exhibits high resonances at relatively higher eneries .",
    "the first excited state , @xmath57 , is also a dominant state which shows extensive resonances and enhanced background in the high energy region ( fig .",
    "cross sections of excited states , @xmath58 and @xmath59 in figs.1 c and d are examples of states that dominate the low temperature region because of their near threshold background raised by resonances , decay decay at higher energies . fig .",
    "1e illustrates the dominance of the state @xmath60 at higher temperature by its dense and wide resonances in relatively high energy region .",
    "it is found that the summed contribution of the quartets dominates the total @xmath5 at lower temperature while that of the doublets contributes more at higher temperature .",
    "the existence of photo - excitation - of - core ( pec ) resonances ( yu & seaton 1987 ) at high energies is also a reason for increased total recombination rate coefficients at high temperatures . these relatively wide resonances are observed in the photoionization cross sections of excited states with a valence electron .",
    "the pec resonances are introduced when the core is excited via dipole allowed transitions , while the outer electron remains a spectator .",
    "2 illustrates the wide and prominent pec resonances in the cross sections of rydberg series of states , @xmath61 where @xmath62 , of ni ii .",
    "the arrows point the pec positions at the core thresholds , such as , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , etc ( listed in table 2 ) for dipole allowed transitions of the core ground state , @xmath66 .",
    "pec resonances become more distinct with higher @xmath42 .",
    "the dr collision strengths , @xmath33 , are obtained for recombination into the high - n states in the energy region @xmath53 below each state of the core ion contributing to dr .",
    "the resonances in @xmath33 correspond to rydberg series of states @xmath67 converging to the threshold @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath33 is obtained in two forms : with detailed energy variation with resonances , and analytically averaged over resonances .",
    "the features of @xmath33 are illustrated in fig .",
    "3 where the dotted curves are the detailed ones with resonances , and the solid curves are resonance averaged .",
    "the lower panel presents @xmath33 below the 10 core states , thresholds for allowed transitions , while the upper panel presents the expanded features for the first three thresholds .",
    "the excited target thresholds , given in table 2 , are marked by arrows in the figure .",
    "as @xmath32 increases , the resonances appear closer while the background rises ( as seen in the solid curve ) such that @xmath33 peaks sharply converging on to the threshold .",
    "that is , as @xmath32 increases the outer electron remains loosely bound in a highly excited state while the core decays radiatively .",
    "@xmath33 goes to zero beyond the threshold as the trapped electron flux in the closed channels below the threshold is released through excitation of the target state .",
    "we also note that @xmath33 is almost zero at the starting energy where @xmath32 = 10.0 , indicating negligible radiation damping below this energy . for the total recombination rate coefficients presented here ,",
    "we choose contrubutions from the resonance averaged @xmath33 , rather than the detailed one , because of higher numerical accuracy .    in fig .",
    "3 , the filled circles are the @xmath50 , collision strengths for electron impact excitation ( eie ) , at the excited target thresholds , these are obtained from ( e+ ni iii ) scattering calculations in the close coupling approximaton , as mentioned before .",
    "the comparison of @xmath50 with @xmath69 provide a check of conservation of total electron - photon flux such that the trapped electron flux due to dr resonances below a threshold equals that released due to eie at the threshold , i.e. , @xmath69 should equal @xmath50 ( without the multipole potentials ipert=0 ) .",
    "comparison between the two values given in table 2 show good agreement in general except at threshold @xmath70 where the difference is large .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a near threshold resonance in @xmath50 and insufficient energy resolution for both collision strengths .",
    "we present both the state - specific and the total recombination rate coefficients for the recombined ion , ni  ii .",
    "the total rates are obtained from the sum of the state specific rates along with the contributions from the high n states .",
    "the individual state recombination rates of the bound states are of importance in the determination of non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( nlte ) level population and recombination line intensities .",
    "state specific rates are obtained for 532 bound states of ni ii with n @xmath71 10 and @xmath72 .    table 3 presents the 20 dominant states in order of their contributions , for doublets and quartets separately , at temperatures t = 100 , 1000 , 10000 , and 20000 k. the order of the contributing states varies with temperature depending on the resonance structures in @xmath18 with energies .",
    "the state specific rates at higher temperatures are somewhat underestimated since high-@xmath42 ( @xmath73 ) dr contributions are not included individually .",
    "it should be noted that state specific rate coefficients are different from effective recombination rate coefficients , used in spectroscopic modeling , since the latter include contributions from higher bound states through radiative cascades .",
    "the complete table for the state specific rates are available electronically",
    ". however , there may be some spectroscopic misidentification of states .",
    "the strong electron - electron correlation in ni ii introduces some complications in the quatum defect analysis for ls term identification .",
    "there are some cases when the same state can correspond to a few possible spectroscopic identifications , rather than a unique one .",
    "we also noted a few states missing in the calculated set but have been observed .",
    "table 4 presents the total electron - ion recombination rate coefficients , @xmath5 , of ni  ii recombining from ni  iii ground state .",
    "the rates are given at temperatures from 10 to @xmath74k , with a temperature mesh of @xmath75 = 0.1 .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "4 shows @xmath76 vs. @xmath77 and the basic features .",
    "as for other ions , the total ( e+ion ) recombination rate for ni ii is maximum at low temperatures due to dominance by radiative recombination .",
    "@xmath5 decreases by more than an order of magnitude as the temperature increases from @xmath78=1 to @xmath79 4.4 , but rises again at higher temperature because of dominant contributions of dr which peaks at about @xmath80 k , above which it falls smoothly .",
    "there is a small `` bump '' in the rates , the low - temperature dr bump , at around @xmath81k due to near threshold autoionizing resonances in the photoionization cross sections .",
    "this bump has been observed in several other ions ( e.g. nahar & pradhan 1997 ) .",
    "we note that the contributions from the nonresonant background cross sections of high - n states , @xmath82 , to the total @xmath5 is considerable at low temperatures when the mean electron energy is in general low for forming autoionizing resonances contributing to dr .",
    "present total @xmath5 ( solid curve ) are compared with the recombination rate coefficients derived by shull and steenberg ( 1982 ) in fig .",
    "they derived the radiative recombination rates ( dashed curve ) by extrapolation along isoelectronic sequences , and obtained the dielectronic recombination rates ( dotted curve ) using the burgess general formula ( burgess 1965 ) .",
    "their rr and dr rates have been added for the total ( dot - dash curve ) .",
    "these values underestimate ni ii recombination rates in the low temperature region since the near threshold resonance structures were not considered in their data sources .",
    "the high temperature rates on the other hand are overestimated because the burgess formula does not include : ( i ) the interference effect of the resonant dr and continuum background which is considerable for multi - electron systems , and ( ii ) the autoionization into excited core states in addition to the ground state .",
    "this latter process reduces dr considerably if the channel couplings are strong , as in the present case .",
    "the accuracy of the present total recombination rate coefficients , @xmath5 , for ni  ii may be estimated to be about 30% in most of the temperature range , except at very high temperatures where the cross sections are extrapolated and at very low temperatures where resonances may require higher resolution .",
    "the accuracy estimate is based on the general agreement between the calculated and the observed energies , use of observed target energies for accurate resonance positions , the general accuracy of the cc method for photoionization cross sections , electron scattering , and dr collision strengths , and previous comparison between results of the unified method and experiment ( e.g. zhang , nahar & pradhan 1999 ) .",
    "some effects not included here could improve the results .",
    "first , the relativistic effects could be important for this heavy , many electron ion .",
    "although the unified treatment for ( e+ion ) recombination has been extended to include relativistic effects in the breit - pauli r - matrix approximation ( zhang & pradhan 1997 , zhang , nahar & pradhan 1999 ) and employed for highly charged li - like and he - like c and fe ( nahar , pradhan & zhang 2000 , 2001 ) we do not expect relativistic effects to be too important for ni ii .",
    "also , by using a larger wavefunction expansion that includes states for core transitions at higher energies may somewhat enhance the recombination rates .",
    "however , additional calculations including these effects will require extensive computing resourses .",
    "total and state specific electron - ion recombination rate coefficients , @xmath5 , are presented for e + ni iii @xmath0 ni ii .",
    "the calculations were carried out in the close coupling approximation employing a unified treatment . to our knowledge , this is the first detailed and accurate study for the recombination of ni  ii .",
    "the partial photoionization cross sections of a large number of bound states are also presented .",
    "present recombination rates , alongwith the _ total _ photoionization cross sections obtained with the same close coupling expansion ( bautista 1999 ) , will provide self - consistent atomic data for accurate calculations of ionization balance for plasmas in photoionization or coronal equilibria . the total recombination rate coefficients differ considerably from the currently used values .",
    "this work was supported partially by the nsf ( ast-987 - 0089 ) and the nasa astrophysics data program .",
    "the computations were carried out at the center for computational science at nasa goddard space flight center , and at the ohio supercomputer center in columbus , ohio .",

    "<S> we present the first detailed ab initio quantum mechanical calculations for total and state - specific recombination rate coefficients for e + ni iii @xmath0 ni ii . </S>",
    "<S> these rates are obtained using a unified treatment for total electron - ion recombination that treats the nonresonant radiative recombination and the resonant dielectronic recombination in a self - consistent unified manner in the close coupling approximation . </S>",
    "<S> large - scale calculations are carried out using a 49-state wavefunction expansion from core configurations @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 that permits the inclusion of prominent dipole allowed core transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these extensive calculations for the recombination rates of ni ii required hundreds of cpu hours on the cray t90 . </S>",
    "<S> the total recombination rate coefficients are provided for a wide range of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the state - specific recombination rates for 532 bound states of doublet and quartet symmetries , and the corresponding photoionization cross sections for leaving the core in the ground state , are presented . </S>",
    "<S> present total recombination rate coefficients differ considerably from the currently used data in astrophysical models .    </S>"
