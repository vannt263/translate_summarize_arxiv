    "_ detrended fluctuation analysis _ ( dfa ) , originally introduced by peng et al .",
    "@xcite , has been established as an important method to reliably detect long - range ( auto- ) correlations in data effected by trends .",
    "the method is based on random walk theory .",
    "its non - detrending predecessors are hurst s rescaled range analysis @xcite and fluctuation analysis ( fa ) @xcite .",
    "dfa was later generalized for higher order detrending @xcite , multifractal analysis @xcite , separate analysis of sign and magnitude series @xcite , and data with more than one dimension @xcite .",
    "its features have been studied in many articles @xcite .",
    "in addition , several comparisons of dfa with other methods for stationary and non - stationary time - series analysis have been published , see , e.g. , @xcite and in particular @xcite , where dfa is compared with many other established methods for short data sets .",
    "the convenience of dfa has led to a broad range of application in very diverse fields where long - range correlations are of interest :    * dna sequences , * medical and physiological time series ( recordings of heartbeat , breathing , blood pressure , blood flow , nerve spike intervals , human gait , glucose levels , gene expression data ) , * geophysics time series ( recordings of temperature , precipitation , water runoff , ozone levels , wind speed , seismic events , vegetational patterns , and climate dynamics ) , * astrophysical time series ( x - ray light sources and sunspot numbers ) , * technical time series ( internet traffic , highway traffic , and neutronic power from a reactor ) , * social time series ( finance and economy , language characteristics , fatalities in the iraq conflict ) , as well as * physics data , e.g. , surface roughness , chaotic spectra of atoms , and photon correlation spectroscopy recordings .",
    "altogether , there are about 450 papers applying dfa . in most cases positive auto - correlations",
    "were reported leaving only a few exceptions with anti - correlations , see , e.g. , @xcite .    in the dfa technique  as in all techniques based on random walk theory ",
    "time series are integrated by partial summation which enables also the analysis of data with weak correlations .",
    "in addition the integration reduces the noise level caused by imperfect measurements and noise , an advantage that applies also to other related non - detrending methods @xcite .",
    "however , for the reliable characterization of time series , it is also essential to distinguish trends from intrinsic fluctuations , that might be long - term correlated .",
    "monotonous , periodic or step - like trends are caused by external effects , e.  g. , by the greenhouse warming @xcite , seasonal variations for temperature records @xcite and river runoffs @xcite , different levels of daily activity in long - term physiological data @xcite , or unstable light sources in photon correlation spectroscopy @xcite . to characterize a complex system based on time series , trends and fluctuations",
    "are usually studied separately ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "strong trends in data can lead to a false detection of long - term correlations if only one ( non - detrending ) method is used or if the results are not carefully interpreted .",
    "a major advantage of the dfa technique is the systematic elimination of polynomial trends of different order @xcite .",
    "note however that an additive composition of fluctuations and trends is assumed .",
    "the technique can thus assist in gaining insight into the scaling behaviour of the natural variability as well as into the kind of trends of the considered time series @xcite .",
    "still , we would like to note that conclusions should not be based on dfa or variants of this method alone in most applications .",
    "in particular , if it is not clear whether a given time series is indeed long - term correlated or just short - term correlated with a fairly large correlation time scale , results of dfa should be compared with other methods .",
    "for example , one can employ wavelet methods ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another option is to remove short - term correlations by considering averaged series for comparison . for a time series with daily observations and possible short - term correlations up to two years",
    ", for example , one might consider the series of two - year averages and apply dfa as well as fa , hurst s analysis , binned power spectra analysis , and/or wavelet analysis .",
    "only if at least two independent methods consistently indicate long - term correlations , one can be sure that the data are indeed long - term correlated .    lately",
    ", several modifications of the dfa method have been suggested with many different techniques for the elimination of monotonous and periodic trends .",
    "these methods include    * the detrended moving average technique @xcite , which we denote by backward moving average ( bma ) technique ( following @xcite ) , * the centered moving average ( cma ) method @xcite , an essentially improved version of bma , * the modified detrended fluctuation analysis ( mdfa ) @xcite , which is essentially a mixture of old fa and dfa , * the continuous dfa ( cdfa ) technique @xcite , which is particularly intended for the detection of transitions , * the fourier dfa @xcite , * a variant of dfa based on empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) @xcite , * a variant of dfa based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) @xcite , and * a variant of dfa based on high - pass filtering @xcite .",
    "although several of the original publications compare their new suggested method with the dfa , there is no inter - comparison between these new methods .",
    "hence , it is not clear which methods might be most suitable for which application . in this work we comment on all recently suggested detrending random walk based methods we are aware of .",
    "moreover , we study and compare in detail two of the most prominent and  according to our studies  most suitable new methods with standard dfa , presenting their advantages and disadvantages . for recent comparative studies not focused on detrending methods , see @xcite . for studies comparing dfa and bma ,",
    "see @xcite ; note that @xcite also discusses cma . for studies comparing methods for detrending multifractal analysis ( multifractal dfa ( mf - dfa ) and wavelet transform modulus maxima ( wtmm ) method ) , see @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we thoroughly explain the standard dfa as well as the centered moving average ( cma ) method , and a modified detrended fluctuation analysis ( mdfa ) .",
    "we further introduce several other ( more complicated ) detrending methods and remark on their utility .",
    "section 3 reports and discusses our results for dfa , cma and mdfa , obtained from monofractal artificial time series with different lengths , crossovers and monotonous trends .",

    "we are interested in the correlation of the values @xmath3 and @xmath4 for different time lags , i.  e. correlations over different time scales @xmath5 . in order to remove a constant offset in the data , the mean @xmath6 is usually subtracted , @xmath7 .",
    "quantitatively , correlations between @xmath8-values separated by @xmath5 steps are defined by the ( auto- ) correlation function @xmath9 if the @xmath3 are uncorrelated , @xmath10 is zero for @xmath11 .",

    "a direct calculation of @xmath10 is usually not appropriate due to underlying non - stationarities and trends of unknown origin .",
    "furthermore , @xmath10 strongly fluctuates around zero on large scales @xmath5 , making it impossible to find the potential scaling behaviour ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "thus , one has to determine the correlation exponent @xmath17 indirectly .",
    "note that in some applications a separate inspection of short - term and long - term correlations is desirable .",

    "the mean of all quotients at a particular scale @xmath5 is equivalent to @xmath32 ( except for multi - fractal data ) and usually shows a power - law scaling relationship with @xmath5 .    while both , fa and hurst s method fail to determine correlation properties if linear or higher order trends are present in the data , dfa explicitly deals with monotonous trends in a detrending procedure",
    "this is done by estimating a piecewise polynomial trend @xmath33 within each segment @xmath26 by least - square fitting .",
    "i.e. , @xmath33 consists of concatenated polynomials of order @xmath34 which are calculated separately for each of the segments .",
    "the detrended profile function @xmath35 on scale @xmath5 is determined by ( ` detrending ' ) : @xmath36 the degree of the polynomial can be varied in order to eliminate linear @xmath37 , quadratic @xmath38 or higher order trends of the profile function @xcite .",
    "conventionally the dfa is named after the order of the fitting polynomial ( dfa1 , dfa2 , ... ) .",
    "note that dfa1 is equivalent to hurst s analysis in terms of detrending .",
    "the variance of @xmath35 yields the fluctuation function on scale @xmath5 @xmath39 this function , which has to be calculated for different scales @xmath5 , corresponds to the trend - eliminated root mean square displacement of the random walker mentioned above and is related to the auto - correlation function by an integral expression @xcite ; see the appendix of @xcite for a derivation for dfa1 . for an equivalent , but more common description of dfa , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we note that in studies that include averaging over many records ( or one record cut into many separate pieces by the elimination of some unreliable intermediate data points ) the averaging procedure ( [ fluctuationfunction ] ) must be performed for all data .",
    "taking the square root should usually be the final step after all averaging is finished ; however note @xcite , where this order is reversed .",
    "it is usually not appropriate to calculate @xmath32 for parts of the data and then average the @xmath32 values , since such a procedure will bias the results towards smaller scaling exponents on large time scales close to the maximum scale @xmath40 where statistically reliable results can be obtained @xcite .",
    "if @xmath32 increases for increasing @xmath5 asymptotically as @xmath41 with @xmath42 , one finds that the scaling ( or hurst ) exponent @xmath43 is related to the correlation exponent @xmath17 by @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "a value of @xmath45 thus indicates that there are no ( or only short - term ) correlations .",
    "if @xmath46 , the data are long - term correlated .",
    "the higher @xmath43 , the stronger are the correlations in the signal . note that @xmath47 indicates a non - stationary local average of the data ; in this case both , fa and hurst analysis fail and yield only @xmath48 .",
    "the case @xmath49 corresponds to long - term anticorrelations , meaning that large values are most likely to be followed by small values and vice versa @xcite .",
    "if the type of trends in given data is not known beforehand , the fluctuation function @xmath32 should be calculated for several orders @xmath34 of the fitting polynomial .",
    "if @xmath34 is too low , @xmath32 will show a pronounced crossover to a regime with larger slope for large scales @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the maximum slope of @xmath50 versus @xmath51 is @xmath52 .",
    "the crossover will move to larger scales @xmath5 or disappear when @xmath34 is increased , unless it is a real crossover in the intrinsic fluctuations and not due to trends @xcite .",
    "hence , one can find @xmath34 such that detrending is sufficient .",
    "however , @xmath34 should not be larger than necessary , because deviations on short scales @xmath5 increase with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "a possible drawback of the dfa method is the occurrence of abrupt jumps in the detrended profile @xmath35 ( eq .  ( [ detrendedfunction ] ) ) at the boundaries between the segments , since the fitting polynomials in neighbouring segments are not related .",
    "a simple way to avoid these jumps would be the calculation of @xmath32 based on polynomial fits in overlapping windows .",
    "however , this is rather time consuming due to the polynomial fit in each segment and is consequently not done in most applications . to overcome the problem of artificial jumps and to reliable",
    "determine the scaling exponent @xmath43 in non - stationary time series , several modifications of the fa and dfa methods were suggested in the last years .",
    "a particular attractive modification leads to the methods of _ detrended moving average _",
    "( dma ) , where running averages replace the polynomial fits .",
    "its first suggested version , the _ backward moving average _ ( bma )",
    "method @xcite , however , slightly underestimates the scaling exponent by about 0.05 , because an artificial time shift of @xmath5 between the original signal and the moving average is introduced .",
    "this time shift leads to an additional contribution to @xmath35 , which causes a larger fluctuation function @xmath32 in particular for small scales in the case of long - term correlated data @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bma method is effectively not detrending @xcite .",
    "its slope @xmath43 is limited by 1 just as for the earlier non - detrending methods fa and @xmath20 .",
    "it was soon recognized that the artificial time shift of the bma method can easily be eliminated .",
    "this leads to the _ centered moving average _ ( cma ) method @xcite , where @xmath35 is calculated as @xmath53 while eq .",
    "( [ fluctuationfunction ] ) stays the same . unlike dfa",
    ", the cma method can not easily be generalized to remove linear and higher order trends in the data . however , cma is somehow similar to dfa1 with overlapping windows .",
    "another type of detrended fluctuation analysis , which we will denote as _ modified detrended fluctuation analysis _",
    "( mdfa ) @xcite , eliminates trends similar to the dfa method .",
    "a polynomial is fitted to the profile function @xmath28 in each segment @xmath26 and the deviation between the profile function and the polynomial fit is calculated , @xmath54 . to estimate correlations in the data , this method uses a derivative of @xmath35 , obtained for each segment @xmath26 , by @xmath55 .",

    "since the fitting polynomials in adjacent segments are not related , @xmath57 shows abrupt jumps on their boundaries as well .",
    "this leads to fluctuations of @xmath32 for large segment sizes @xmath5 as we will show below .",
    "several modifications and extensions of dfa have been proposed .",
    "most of them are , however , rather complicated in implementation .",
    "while they might be very useful in particular applications , we believe the implications of the complicated detrending and decomposition techniques are not sufficiently understood and their programming effort is too large for a wide usage .    the _ fourier - detrended fluctuation analysis _ @xcite aims to eliminate slow oscillatory trends which are found especially in weather and climate series due to seasonal influences .",
    "the character of these trends can be rather periodic and regular or irregular , and their influence on the detection of long - range correlations by means of dfa was systematically studied previously @xcite . among other things",
    "it has been shown that low - frequency periodic trends disturb the scaling behaviour of the results much stronger than high - frequency trends and thus have to be removed prior to the analysis . in case of periodic and regular oscillations , e.g. , in temperature fluctuations",
    "one simply removes the low frequency seasonal trend by subtracting the daily mean temperatures from the data .",
    "another way , which the fourier - detrended fluctuation analysis suggests , is to filter out the relevant frequencies in the signals fourier spectrum before applying dfa to the filtered signal .",
    "nevertheless , this method which is only an extension of dfa faces several difficulties especially its limitation to periodic and regular trends .",
    "furthermore one needs to know the interfering frequency band beforehand .    to study correlations in data with quasi - periodic or irregular oscillating trends , _ empirical mode decomposition _ ( emd )",
    "was suggested @xcite .",
    "the emd algorithm breaks down the signal into its intrinsic mode functions ( imfs ) which can be used to distinguish between fluctuations and trends .",
    "the trends , estimated by a quasi - periodic fit containing the dominating frequencies of a sufficiently large number of imfs , is subtracted from the data , yielding a slightly better scaling behaviour in the dfa curves .",
    "however , we believe , that this extension of dfa is too complicated for wide - spread applications .    another extension of dfa which was shown to minimize the effect of periodic and quasi - periodic trends is based on _ singular value decomposition _ ( svd ) @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one first embeds the original signal in a matrix whose dimension has to be much larger than the number of frequency components of the periodic or quasi - periodic trends obtained in the power spectrum .",
    "applying svd yields a diagonal matrix which can be manipulated by setting the dominant eigen - values ( associated with the trends ) to zero .",
    "the filtered matrix finally leads to the filtered data , and it has been shown that subsequent application of dfa determines the expected scaling behaviour if the embedding dimension is sufficiently large .",
    "none the less , the performance of this rather complex method seems to decrease for larger values of the scaling exponent .",
    "furthermore svd - dfa assumes that trends are deterministic and narrow banded .",
    "nevertheless the above - mentioned extensions of dfa show the need for a fluctuation analysis that can also handle oscillatory data automatically .",
    "the detrending procedure in dfa ( eq .  ( [ detrendedfunction ] ) ) can be regarded as a scale - dependent high - pass filter since ( low - frequency ) fluctuations exceeding a specific scale @xmath5 are eliminated .",
    "therefore , it has been suggested to obtain the detrended profile @xmath58 for each scale @xmath5 directly by applying digital high - pass filters @xcite . in particular , butterworth ,",
    "chebyshev - i , chebyshev - ii , and an elliptical filter were suggested .",
    "while the elliptical filter showed the best performance in detecting long - range correlations in artificial data , the chebyshev - ii filter was found to be problematic .",
    "additionally , in order to avoid a time shift between filtered and original profile , the average of the directly filtered signal and the time reversed filtered signal is considered .",
    "the effects of these complicated filters on the scaling behaviour are , however , not fully understood .",
    "finally , a continuous dfa method has been suggested in the context of studying heartbeat data during sleep @xcite .",
    "the method compares unnormalized fluctuation functions @xmath32 for increasing length of the data .",
    "i.e. , one starts with a very short recording and subsequently adds more points of data .",
    "the method is particularly suitable for the detection of change points in the data , e.g. , physiological transitions between different activity or sleep stages .",
    "since the main objective of the method is not the study of scaling behaviour , we do not discuss it in detail in this comparison .",

    "ultimately , we think that cma is a good alternative to dfa1 when analyzing the scaling properties in short data sets without trends . nevertheless for data with possible unknown trends we recommend the application of standard dfa with several different detrending polynomial orders to distinguish real crossovers from artificial crossovers due to trends . in addition , an independent approach ( e.g. , wavelet analysis ) should be used to confirm findings of long - range correlations .    _",
