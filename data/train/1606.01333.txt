    "chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars play a key role as a test of evolutionary models due to their anomalous atmospheric composition .",
    "many of them are periodic variable stars with periods corresponding to rotational periods @xcite .",
    "therefore , cp stars are very helpful for a study of rotational periods and their stability among main - sequence stars .",
    "preferably , stellar parameters would be known with high precision for such studies , especially the stellar mass .",
    "mass of the star is one of the most important parameters for establishing of the evolutionary status and can be determined with high accuracy when the star belongs to a binary system .",
    "information about binarity is also necessary for a study of brightness variations ( even if it is not an eclipsing system ) .",
    "an additional light source in the system influences the observed amplitude of variability ( decrease in observed amplitude ) and observed spectra ( depths and shapes of spectral lines , appearance of additional lines ) .",
    "another component also affects radial velocities ( hereafter rvs ) of the studied star .    our target  ( hd  170000 = hip",
    "89908 = hr  6920 ) is one of the brightest cp stars ( @xmath0mag ) . for a long time , it has been known as a variable star @xcite with relatively low amplitude in optical bands ( 0.020.03mag ) and rotational period about 1.7d e.g. 1.7164 @xcite , 1.71646(6)d @xcite .",
    "we selected this star for calculation of model of its atmosphere , which was subsequently used for light curve reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the availability of abundance maps from doppler imaging in @xcite , which were used for calculation of atmospheric models , was the main criterion for the selection of this star .",
    "the opportunity to compare our light curve models with high - accurate 10-colour photometry obtained by @xcite belongs to the great advantages .",
    "the preliminary results from this effort , in which the main chemical elements known from spectra are included in the model of the synthetic atmosphere , are very promising @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was used e.g. for star hd  37776 @xcite and hr  7224 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless ,  is a multiple stellar system and several basic parameters , such as the period of the inner binary system , are highly uncertain ( see below ) . in this paper",
    ", we performed a detailed analysis of the multiple system to adequately estimate the influence of the multiplicity on our light curve modelling , which is presented in @xcite .",
    "the object  is probably a triple system with components aa , ab and b @xcite but a fourth component c ( optical ) is also present in the washington double star catalog ( wds , * ? ? ?",
    "outer binary system ab creates a visual binary with known brightness for both components from hipparcos satellite @xmath1mag and @xmath2mag @xcite .",
    "their orbit with very long period was calculated several times and the last published orbital parameters from @xcite include orbital period @xmath3 years , angular projection of semi - major axis @xmath4 , and high eccentricity @xmath5 .",
    "main a component is an sb1-type spectroscopic binary ( aa , ab ) with contradictory orbital period of 26.768(7 ) days @xcite or 127.85 days @xcite .    the star  is a frequently studied , but no comprehensive study of the multiple system exists .",
    "furthermore , several catalogues adopted the orbital period of @xcite despite the fact that it was determined only from 10 measurements and the authors themselves doubted its correctness because this period is not compatible with any of older datasets .",
    "we re - analysed the available rv measurements to obtain correct orbital parameters of the inner binary system aab ( sect .  [ specbin ] ) .",
    "thereafter , we used relative position measurements of b component from wds and verified results from @xcite , sect .",
    "[ visbin ] .",
    "evidence for the gravitational bond of the binary is presented in sect .",
    "[ visbinbound ] .",
    "in addition , we consider an unbound explanation ( sect .",
    "[ visbinunbound ] ) .",
    "we briefly discuss component c and whether it is bound to components a and b in sect .",
    "[ opticbin ] .",
    "we also analyse the whole triple system together ( sect .",
    "[ wholesystem ] ) .",
    "our final results are summarized and discussed in sect .",
    "[ summarysection ] .",
    "the first spectroscopic observations of  @xcite revealed a peculiar spectrum with lines of hydrogen ( balmer series ) , he  i ( 4026.4  ) , and si  ii ( 4128.5 , 4131.4  ) .",
    "rvs of  were measured with low - resolution spectrographs ( from composed spectra with fainter b component ) and angular distance between both components was under 0.5@xmath6 during 20@xmath7 century ( sect .",

    "unfortunately , modern high - quality spectra are almost absent .",

    "used rv measurements are above the central line .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - hrdiagram ]    * notes : * @xmath8 values for the whole system a+b were calculated from parameters for a and b components and from pogson equation .",
    "we performed a complete analysis of the multiple stellar system  ( expected hierarchy of the system is in fig .",
    "[ fig - hierarchy ] ) with focus on the inner binary system aab .",
    "we disproved orbital elements from @xcite , and utilizing 4 sources of rv measurements we found 128-day period and other orbital parameters which are close to results determined by @xcite .",
    "the orbit of the outer visual binary system ab was solved three - times during history .",
    "we showed that orbital elements from @xcite and @xcite do not describe new measurements .",
    "the latest solution from @xcite fits well all available relative position measurements and relative orbit of the binary .",
    "nevertheless , these variations could be well explained using unbound binary star motion as was shown in sect .",
    "[ visbinunbound ] . the current difference between bound and unbound models of motion b star relative to a",
    "is still small and thus unbound explanation can not be completely ruled out .",
    "we attempted to find proofs for the bound binary hypothesis .",
    "the similarities in proper motions and the hr diagram , where a and b components lie on the almost same isochrone , we present as the most promising evidences .",
    "we also discussed the last possible component c , but we present clear evidence that its gravitational bond is not real ( e.g. different proper motions ) . in each case , its influence on the whole system is almost undetectable",
    ".    visual orbit of the outer binary ab allowed us to determine the total mass of the triple system about 7.6m@xmath9 , nevertheless with respect to the older models of visual system and with the fact that only about half of the orbit have been finished from its discovery , the value must be accepted circumspectly .",
    "we adopted mass of aa component @xmath10m@xmath9 from literature and we obtained minimal ab mass @xmath11m@xmath9 from spectroscopic orbit .",
    "the rest of total mass remains on the b component with maximal mass @xmath12m@xmath9 .",
    "the most probable isochrones in hr diagram predict the same mass of aa component @xmath13m@xmath9 and little different values for masses of other stars @xmath14m@xmath9 , and @xmath15m@xmath9 , which can be possible .",
    "these masses , together with the mass function obtained from the spectroscopic orbit , allow us to estimate the inclination of the aab system orbital plane , @xmath16 .",
    "preliminary values of masses for individual components have been already determined .",
    "unfortunately , authors used unreliable value of inner orbital period from @xcite , thus their values are not actual : @xmath17m@xmath9 , @xmath18m@xmath9 , @xmath19m@xmath9 @xcite , or @xmath20m@xmath9 , @xmath21m@xmath9 , @xmath22m@xmath9 @xcite . ] .",
