    "quantum correlations are considered to be responsible for advantages of quantum devices in comparison with their classical analogues . to quantify these advantages ,",
    "a special measures of quantum correlations have been introduced .",
    "the entanglement @xcite and discord @xcite are known as two basic measures .",
    "however , the role of such correlations is not completely clarified .",
    "of course , they have to be available in the system .",
    "but , up to now , it is not clear whether the quantum correlations must be large in order to reveal all advantages of quantum information devises .",
    "moreover , there are many verifications of the hypothesis that the quantum correlations measured either by entanglement or discord should nt be large . for instance , there are quantum states without entanglement revealing a quantum non - locality @xcite . in addition , speed - up of certain calculations may be organized with negligible entanglement @xcite .",
    "we also should remember that the discord is not the only measure of quantum correlations showing that entanglement does not cover all of them .",
    "for instance , the so - called localizable entanglement ( le ) @xcite was introduced as a maximal amount of entanglement which can be established between two selected particles of a quantum system by doing local measurements on the rest of the quantum system . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "considering examples of the anti - ferromagnetic spin chains authors show that the local measurements result in increase of the bi - particle entanglement . in some sense",
    ", le is the `` intermediate '' measure of quantum correlations between the entanglement and discord . in the later case ,",
    "the local measurements are performed on one of two selected particles .",
    "the advantage of le is that its upper and lower bounds are directly related to correlation functions which , in turn , have a physical nature .    these interesting results together with an observation that almost all quantum states possess the non - vanishing quantum discord @xcite might lead us to the conclusion ( which perhaps causes doubts ) that almost all quantum systems may be effectively used in the quantum information devices .",
    "thus , the above discussion suggests us to conclude that even the quantum devices based on the states with minor ( but nonzero ) entanglement and/or discord may exhibit advantages in comparison with their classical counterparts .",
    "such behavior may be explained by the observation that the spread of information about the state of a given subsystem throughout the whole quantum system does not require the large values of either entanglement or discord @xcite . in other words , if we change a state of a given subsystem @xmath1 at the initial time instant @xmath8 ( for instance , applying the unitary transformation ) , then , generally speaking , any other subsystem of the whole quantum system will know about the new state of @xmath1 at ( almost ) any instant @xmath9 . in turn , namely this information provides the overall mutual relations among all parties of a quantum system .",
    "moreover , it is valuable that the spread ( or distribution ) of information throughout the whole system does not require the fine adjustment of the parameters of a quantum system , unlike the large discord and/or entanglement , when the minor deviation of the system s parameters from the required values may crucially decrease the values of these measures .",
    "it is worthwhile to say that the spread of information is observed even in the system with separable initial state when there is neither discord no entanglement between subsystems initially @xcite .",
    "of course the discord and entanglement may appear in the course of evolution , but their values are not crucial for the information distribution .",
    "the measure of correlations introduced in this paper is based on the outlined above information distribution .    before",
    "proceed to the subject of our paper , let us notice that the system - environment states with vanishing discord give impact to study the evolution of a system as a completely positive map @xcite from the initial state of this system to its evolving state @xcite .",
    "however , although originally the completely positive maps were found for the states with initially vanishing discord @xcite , it was shown later that the vanishing discord is not necessary for this @xcite .",
    "thus , here the situation is opposite to the quantum nonlocality and speedup .",
    "similar to the above refs.@xcite , we consider the evolution of the state of a given subsystem @xmath2 of some quantum system as a map of the initial state of another subsystem @xmath1 and show that this map is responsible for the information distribution between two chosen subsystems .",
    "then , correlations ( which absent initially ) appear as result of such evolution .",
    "our basic study is referred to the systems having the tensor product initial states ( and zero discords ) , when the above map becomes completely positive one .",
    "however , our algorithm may be extended to systems with general initial states ( this problem is briefly discussed in appendix c , sec.[section : c ] ) .    in this paper , we do not separate quantum and classical effects . instead , we study the possibility to handle the state of some subsystem @xmath2 at some instant @xmath7 by means of the local unitary transformation @xmath4 of another subsystem @xmath1 at instant @xmath10 .",
    "we refer to the measure quantifying this effect as _ the informational correlation _ @xmath0 between two parties @xmath1 and @xmath2 of a quantum system . in this regard",
    ", one has to mention ref.@xcite where the quantumness of operations has been studied without the direct relation to the entanglement and discord , similar to our case .",
    "we also shall note , that although the discord and entanglement reveal the physical nature of quantum correlations , they may not be directly used as `` working units '' in quantum devices , because , in general , they are not expressed in terms of measurable quantities . on the contrary ,",
    "the informational correlation is expressed in terms of the parameters of unitary transformation showing how many of these parameters may be transfered between two subsystems . these parameters , in turn , might be treated , for instance , as bits of quantum gates .",
    "this conclusion is a basic motivation for the introduction of the informational correlation .    unlike the usual definition of the information through the entropy @xcite , we define the measure of informational correlation as the number of parameters @xmath3 of the local unitary transformation @xmath11 , @xmath12 that may be detected in the subsystem @xmath2 by means of the local measurements .",
    "vise - verse , the influence of the subsystem @xmath2 on the subsystem @xmath1 may be characterized by the informational correlation @xmath13 which equals the number of parameters @xmath3 in the local transformation @xmath14 , @xmath15 , of the subsystem @xmath2 that may be detected in the subsystem @xmath1 by means of the local measurements .",
    "we assume that namely these measures @xmath0 and @xmath13 characterize the strength of those quantum correlations which are responsible for the information exchange between parties . in turn",
    ", namely the mutual exchange of the parameters may be used in the realization of elementary logical gates .",
    "emphasize that , in general , @xmath16 and @xmath5 , i.e. , this measure is not symmetrical , similar to the discord , which depends on the particular subsystem chosen for the local classical measurements . for",
    "the tensor product initial state @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the density matrices of the subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while @xmath20 is the density matrix of the rest of the quantum system ) , it will be shown that @xmath21 only if both initial density matrices of subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 are proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "note , that the unitary invariant discord @xcite possesses the same property .",
    "below , we study the informational correlation @xmath0 only .",
    "for the tensor product initial state @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is the density matrix of the subsystem @xmath24 ) , it will be shown , in particular , that the informational correlation is invariant with respect to the initial local unitary transformations of the subsystem @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath0 depends only on the eigenvalues of the initial density matrix @xmath25 ) and might be changed by the initial local unitary transformations of the subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , we reveal such part of the informational correlation which may not be decreased by the local unitary transformations of the subsystem @xmath2 at a given time instant @xmath7 ( the so - called non - reducible informational correlation ) .    among the local unitary transformations one should select a special type of local operations ( the so - called locally non - effective unitary operations ( lnus ) ) which do not change the state of the subsystem @xmath1 but may change the state of the whole quantum system .",
    "the effect of these transformations on the state of the whole system has been studied in refs.@xcite . however , using lnus , we may obtain only zero informational correlation in a system with the tensor product initial state considered in our paper .",
    "in other words , lnus are useless in our case .",
    "however , we assume the relevance of such transformations for systems with more general initial states .",
    "such systems deserve the special study and are not considered here in details ( some notes about these systems are given in appendix c , sec.[section : c ] ) .    in this paper",
    "the relation of the informational correlation with the well known measures of quantum correlations ( such as entanglement and discord ) is discussed only on the rather qualitative background and there is no direct analogy between them .",
    "the most principal difference is the fact that the informational correlation defined in our paper is a dynamical quantity and equals to zero identically at the initial time instant ( i.e. , at the instant of applying of the local unitary transformation to the subsystem @xmath1 ) .",
    "we consider the tensor product initial state , so that both entanglement and discord equal to zero initially .",
    "thus , we represent the detailed analysis of informational correlation in the systems with initially zero entanglement / discord , while the systems with other initial states ( where the entanglement and/or discord are , generally speaking , non - zero ) deserve the special study .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[section : def ] , we introduce the definition of the informational correlation and discuss the non - reducible informational correlation .",
    "examples of the informational correlations in the four node spin-1/2 homogeneous chain governed by the xy hamiltonian with the nearest neighbor interactions are considered in sec.[section : examples ] .",
    "particular examples of the informational correlations in a long spin chain with single excitation are considered in sec.[section : long ] . in sec.[section : conclusions ] , we collect the basic properties of the informational correlation and compare them with the corresponding properties of the entanglement / discord .",
    "some additional information and calculations are given in the appendix , sec.[section : appendix ] .",
    "in particular , appendix c ( sec.[section : c ] ) is devoted to some properties of informational correlation in the systems with non - separable initial states .",
    "as is noted in sec.[sec : introduction ] , the definition of informational correlation is based on the parameters of unitary transformation . to proceed with",
    ", we introduce the set of notations for a given quantum system @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the closed region in the space of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath29 . as usual",
    ", @xmath30 denotes the appropriate open region .",
    "hereafter we assume that the whole quantum system is splitted into the three subsystems @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath31 .",
    "we study the correlations between the subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while @xmath31 is the rest of a quantum system .",
    "thus , the total system is @xmath32 . in particular ,",
    "the subsystem @xmath31 may be absent .",
    "let the state of the whole quantum system be described by the density matrix @xmath33 . in turn ,",
    "as usual , the states of the subsystems @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath31 and @xmath24 are represented by the reduced density matrices @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath34 and @xmath23 respectively : @xmath35    the measure of correlations proposed below is based on the effects of the local unitary transformations performed on one of two selected subsystems of a quantum system .",
    "let us effect on the state of the subsystem @xmath2 by means of the unitary transformation @xmath11 of the subsystem @xmath1 at the initial instant @xmath36 .",
    "let us determine how many parameters of the arbitrary transformation @xmath37 may be detected in the subsystem @xmath2 at this instant . for this purpose",
    "we , first of all , fix the state of the system at @xmath38 by the initial density matrix @xmath39 .",
    "the local transformation @xmath37 transforms the initial density matrix @xmath39 of the whole system @xmath40 into the density matrix @xmath41 as follows : @xmath42 now the initial density matrix @xmath43 at @xmath38 reads @xmath44 while the initial density matrix @xmath45 remains the same , @xmath46 which means that no parameters @xmath3 may be detected in @xmath19 at @xmath38 .",
    "eqs.([ua0 ] ) and ( [ ub0 ] ) are valid for any subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 no matter whether there is quantum interaction between them .",
    "next , if the subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 do not interact , then no information about the state of the subsystem @xmath1 propagates into the subsystem @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "consequently , no parameters @xmath3 of the applied transformation @xmath11 may be detected in the subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "in other words , the performed transformation will not effect on the state of the subsystem @xmath2 .    however , the information about the state of the subsystem @xmath1 propagates into the subsystem @xmath2 if there is quantum interaction between these subsystems . owing to this interaction ,",
    "some of the parameters of the unitary transformation @xmath11 may be transfered into the subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "this interaction is represented by the unitary @xmath7-dependent transformation applied to the whole system and leads to the evolution of the density matrix : @xmath47 in particular , if the evolution of our quantum system is governed by the stationary hamiltonian @xmath48 , then @xmath49 in accordance with the liouville equation . in this case , the state of the subsystem @xmath2 is represented by the following reduced evolution density matrix : @xmath50 hereafter we consider the initial density matrix @xmath39 in the form of the tensor product of two initial density matrices : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the initial density matrices of the subsystem @xmath1 and of the joined subsystem @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "now , using eqs.([rho_phi_a ] ) and ( [ inden ] ) , we may write eq.([ut ] ) as @xmath54 in terms of the matrix elements as follows : @xmath55 for the subsequent analysis , we separate the @xmath7- and @xmath56-dependences in the rhs of eq.([ttmel ] ) into two different matrices",
    ". this structure would be more convenient for the study of the @xmath3-dependence of both lhs and rhs of eq.([ttmel ] ) . doing this",
    ", we first write eq.([ttmel ] ) in components using the following matrix representations of the operators : @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) ; the indices with subscripts @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath31 are related to the subsystems @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath31 respectively .",
    "writing the matrix representation we may use any basis associated with a proper subsystem . for instant , in the case of spin-1/2 chains considered below this basis might be composed by the eigenstates of the @xmath60-projection operators of spin angular momenta .",
    "thus , we have the following : @xmath61 where the elements @xmath62 ( independent on @xmath56 ) are defined by the formulas : @xmath63 the important feature of eq.([ttmel2 ] ) is that the @xmath56-dependence appears only through the initial density matrix @xmath43 of the subsystem @xmath1 .",
    "this becomes possible because of the tensor product initial state ( [ inden ] ) .",
    "such separation of @xmath7- and @xmath56-dependences is impossible for other initial states , see appendix c , sec.[section : c ] .",
    "further , in order to determine the number of parameters transfered from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , it is convenient to represent eq.([ttmel2 ] ) in a different form .",
    "the matter is that eqs.([ttmel2 ] ) , as well as the density matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 , are complex while the parameters @xmath3 are real",
    ". therefore we represent eqs.([ttmel2 ] ) as a system of real equations .",
    "for this purpose , we split eq.([ttmel2 ] ) into the real and imaginary parts writing the result in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the density matrices @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite . doing this , we need the following notations ( hereafter we use the matrix indices without the subscripts @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath31 ) : @xmath64 now , we write eq.([ttmel2 ] ) as the following three subsystems : @xmath65 where subsystem ( [ rit1 ] ) is the real off - diagonal part of eq.([ttmel2 ] ) , subsystem ( [ rit2 ] ) is the imaginary off - diagonal part of the same equation , and subsystem ( [ rit3 ] ) is the diagonal ( real ) part of eq.([ttmel2 ] ) .",
    "we also take into account the relation @xmath66 , which leaves @xmath67 ( instead of @xmath68 ) independent equations in subsystem ( [ rit3 ] ) . therewith elements @xmath69 , @xmath70 , possess the following symmetry with respect to the indices @xmath71 and @xmath72 : @xmath73 where star means the complex conjugate .",
    "however , the structure of system ( [ rit1]-[rit3 ] ) is still not the best one for the further computations . to provide an elegant expression for the informational correlation",
    ", we represent system ( [ rit1]-[rit3 ] ) as a single vector equation . for this purpose",
    ", we relate three vectors @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 with any @xmath77 density matrix @xmath33 .",
    "the components of these vectors @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 are defined as @xmath84 using these vectors , we rewrite eqs.([rit1]-[rit3 ] ) in the following forms : @xmath85 where we introduce the matrices @xmath86 with the elements : @xmath87 thus @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 are @xmath92 matrices , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are @xmath95 matrices , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are @xmath98 matrices and @xmath99 is @xmath100 matrix .",
    "next , we construct the column vectors @xmath101 and @xmath102 of @xmath103 and @xmath104 elements respectively , and the column vector @xmath105 of @xmath106 elements : @xmath107 here the elements of the vectors @xmath108 , @xmath109 , are defined as @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , @xmath114 .",

    "finally , system ( [ ritex1 ] ) becomes the single @xmath122 vector equation : @xmath123 thus , we derive eq.([ritf ] ) as the most convenient form of original operator equation ( [ ttmel ] ) . namely eq.([ritf ] ) will be used hereafter for the calculation of informational correlation and for study of its properties .",
