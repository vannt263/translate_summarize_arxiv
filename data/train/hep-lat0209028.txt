    "one promising method to quantize the theory of gravitation employs the euclidean path integral @xmath0 e^{-i(q ) } ~,\\ ] ] where the partition function describes a fluctuating space - time manifold . in the regge approach",
    "the ( quadratic ) link lengths @xmath1 represent the dynamical degrees of freedom @xcite , deforming continuously a simplicial lattice with fixed incidence matrix , whereas in the somehow complementary approach of dynamical triangulation the incidence matrix is fluctuating with constant link lengths .",
    "any of these two approaches is plagued with various problems ; for the regge approach see @xcite .    in `` conventional '' regge theory",
    "the regge - einstein action including a cosmological term @xcite , @xmath2 is used .",
    "the first sum runs over all products of triangle area @xmath3 times corresponding deficit angle @xmath4 weighted by the bare gravitational coupling @xmath5 .",
    "the second sum extends over the volumes @xmath6 of the 4-simplices of the lattice and allows together with the cosmological constant @xmath7 to set an overall scale in the action .",
    "the discrete regge model was invented in an attempt to reformulate ( [ z ] ) as the partition function of a spin system @xcite .",
    "it is defined by restricting the squared link lengths to take on only two values @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for edges , face diagonals , body diagonals and the hyperbody diagonal of a hypercube , respectively , is chosen to allow for fluctuations around flat space .",
    "the euclidean triangle inequalities are fulfilled automatically as long as @xmath11 is smaller than a maximum value @xmath12 .",
    "the measure @xmath13 $ ] in the quantum gravity path integral is taken to unity for all possible link configurations .",
    "numerical simulations of the @xmath14 system become extremely efficient by implementing look - up tables and a heat - bath algorithm . in this work",
    "typically @xmath15 iterations have been generated .",
    "calculations have been performed with the parameter @xmath16 and the cosmological constant @xmath17 because ( [ q_l ] ) already fixes the average lattice volume .",
    "the discrete regge model  like full regge theory  exhibits two phase transitions @xcite .",
    "one is located at a negative value and the other one at a positive value of the bare gravitational coupling .",
    "although earlier work concentrated on the latter transition , there is no reason for favoring a positive value of @xmath5 over a negative one . since a wick rotation from the lorentzian to the euclidean sector of quantum gravity is not feasible in general , the sign in the exponential of the path integral is not fixed a priori .",
    "the transition for positive gravitational coupling has been observed before the one at negative @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "there , histograms , e.g. of @xmath18 @xcite , clearly show a two - peak structure .",
    "the two phases coexist and tunneling from one phase to the other and back takes place .",
    "the system also exhibits a hysteresis ; the transition occurs at a larger value of @xmath5 if the simulation is started from a configuration in the well - defined phase than it does if the calculation is started from a `` frozen '' configuration .",
    "given all these pieces of evidence , we conjecture that the transition at @xmath19 is of first order .    to determine the order of the transition at negative @xmath5 we employed in ref .",
    "@xcite histogram techniques and used the binder  challa  landau ( bcl ) cumulant criterion @xcite .",
    "the bcl cumulant is defined as @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the action of the system under consideration .",
    "it was evaluated for @xmath22 on different lattice sizes with @xmath23 to @xmath24 vertices per direction , simulating the system at several values of the bare coupling @xmath5 with high statistics . for the bcl cumulant",
    "a trend towards 2/3 was observed and all histograms showed a clear one - peak structure , cf .",
    "@xcite .    in the present monte carlo simulations we recorded for every run the time series of the energy density @xmath25 and the magnetization density @xmath26 , with the lattice size @xmath27 . to obtain results for the various observables @xmath28 at values of the bare gravitational coupling @xmath5 in an interval around the simulation point @xmath29",
    ", we applied the reweighting method  @xcite .    with the help of the time series we can compute the specific heat , @xmath30 and the ( finite lattice ) susceptibility , @xmath31 figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ]",
    "show the finite - size scaling ( fss ) of the maxima of the specific heat @xmath32 and the susceptibility @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "while the behavior of @xmath32 could still be explained as critical scaling with a negative exponent @xmath34 , the flattening of @xmath33 is rather unusual for a second - order transition and should be taken as an indication for a cross - over regime .",
    "another feature of the system can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] depicting the critical gravitational coupling , as determined from the specific - heat maxima @xmath32 and the susceptibility maxima @xmath33 . in the case of a second - order transition",
    "the extrapolations of all pseudo - transition points lead to one infinite - volume critical value .",
    "this seems to be violated in the four - dimensional discrete regge model and thus favors the interpretation as a cross - over phenomenon over a true , thermodynamically defined phase transition .",
    "in the present analysis of the scaling of the maxima of the specific heat and susceptibility we found evidence for a cross - over regime in the four - dimensional discrete regge model of quantum gravity in the negative coupling region . if this can be substantiated by further investigations and also for the regge theory with continuous link lengths , the existence of a continuum limit at negative bare gravitational coupling is questionable .",
    "this is of major concern for a continuum theory of quantum gravity with matter fields  @xcite .",
