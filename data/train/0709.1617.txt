    "the system is strongly interacting in the sense that @xmath1 ( unitarity limit ) , where @xmath2 is the @xmath3-wave scattering length for the atom  atom interaction and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the density of the gas .",
    "a theoretical description of this region is challenging , in particular at non - zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "collective mode experiments have given a wealth of insight into the properties of atomic gases , since they often provide more detailed information than e.g. thermodynamic measurements  @xcite .",
    "in a recent experiment  @xcite the scissors mode excitation in an elliptical trap was used to characterize the transition between hydrodynamic and collisionless behavior as a function of temperature and scattering length . since",
    "both the frequency and attenuation is affected by the atom ",
    "atom interaction , such measurements can give important information on the properties of a fermion system at and near the unitarity limit .",
    "in this brief report we calculate the frequency and attenuation of the scissors mode investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming the temperature to be sufficiently high that the gas can be treated as being classical .",
    "since the calculation involves no fitting parameters , it can be used to identify non - classical features of the observed frequency shift and damping as functions of temperature and/or interaction strength .",
    "consider a two - component ( for brevity denoted by `` spin '' with the two values @xmath6 ) fermi gas of atoms with mass @xmath7 in its normal phase trapped in a potential @xmath8 . at high temperatures , in the classical regime , the dynamics is described by a semi - classical distribution function @xmath9 , which satisfies the boltzmann equation . for the scissors mode studied experimentally in @xcite , the two components of the gas move together , and we need only consider one distribution function @xmath10 .    to calculate the frequency and damping of the scissors mode ,",
    "we linearize the boltzmann equation in terms of a small deviation @xmath11 from the equilibrium distribution @xmath12 by writing @xmath13 .",
    "the linearized boltzmann equation becomes @xmath14\\label{boltzmann},\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the collision integral @xmath17 is given in ref.@xcite with an interaction described by @xmath3-wave scattering involving only particles with opposite spin .",
    "the cross section @xmath18 is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the relative momentum of the scattering particles .",
    "the unitarity limit is defined by @xmath21 .    in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", a scissors mode in the @xmath22 plane is characterized by a velocity field @xmath23 or @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant . to describe this mode we choose an ansatz for @xmath26 of the form @xmath27 where the @xmath28 are constants and @xmath29 is the mode frequency .",
    "we insert this ansatz into the linearized boltzmann equation ( [ boltzmann ] ) and take moments by multiplying by any of the terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 appearing in @xmath32 and subsequently integrating over both @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the result is a homogeneous set of four coupled equations for the coefficients @xmath35 .",

    "the integral in ( [ tauclass ] ) comes from averaging over momentum and space the cross section multiplied by an appropriate weight function . in the unitarity limit , ( [ tauclass ] ) gives @xmath44 $ ] . using ( [ determinant ] ) and ( [ tauclass ] )",
    "we can now calculate the frequency and damping rate @xmath45 of the scissors mode as a function of temperature and scattering length . in the hydrodynamic limit @xmath46",
    ", we obtain from ( [ determinant ] ) @xmath47 in the collisionless limit @xmath48 , eq.([determinant ] ) yields @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "this result , @xmath51 , for the damping rate in the collisionless limit , obtained by taking moments of the kinetic equation , is in fact exact .",
    "this can be seen by treating the collision integral as a perturbation , following the approach used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the collisional relaxation of trapped bosons above their condensation temperature .",
    "we now compare our calculated frequency and damping rate of the scissors mode with the recent experiment on trapped @xmath0li atoms  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ scissoruni ] , we plot the observed frequency and damping rate as a function of temperature at unitarity , @xmath52 .",
    "the scissors mode is excited in the @xmath22 plane in a cigar - shaped trap with @xmath53 hz , @xmath54 hz , and @xmath55 hz .",
    "we use the relation @xmath56 with @xmath57 to convert the effective temperature @xmath58 obtained by fitting the density profile to the real temperature  @xcite .",
    "the calculated frequency and damping from ( [ determinant ] ) and ( [ tauclass ] ) is plotted as solid black lines .",
    "the number of trapped atoms is taken to be @xmath59 .",
    "the dashed black lines in fig .",
    "[ scissoruni ] are the hydrodynamic and collisionless limits given by ( [ hydrodynamic ] ) and ( [ collisionless ] ) respectively .",
    "we see that there is good overall agreement between theory and experiment both for the frequency and damping rate as a function of @xmath60 . for low temperatures ,",
    "the measured damping is somewhat larger than that obtained for our classical model .",
    "since our model does not include fermi blocking effects and superfluidity , this discrepancy is not surprising .",
    "note that the theoretical curves contain no fitting parameters .",
    "due to the anharmonicity of the trap , the observed frequency in the collisionless limit is slightly reduced from ( [ collisionless ] )  @xcite , an effect which is not included in our model , which assumes the trap to be perfectly harmonic",
    ".    we also plot in fig .",
    "[ scissoruni ] as a dash - dotted green line the calculated damping rate obtained from hydrodynamics , using the approach described below .",
    "when the damping is small , the damping rate is determined by the ratio between the rate of loss of mechanical energy and the energy itself . for the velocity field given by ( [ velfield ] ) , the time average of the mechanical energy , @xmath61 , is equal to @xmath62 since in the classical limit the density is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the time average of the rate of loss of mechanical energy is @xmath64 from which the damping rate is obtained as @xmath65 in the unitarity limit in the classical regime , a variational calculation which is accurate to @xmath66 yields  @xcite @xmath67 for the viscosity .",
    "this is independent of density and the integration must be cut off close to the surface of the cloud where the gas is no longer hydrodynamic  @xcite .",
    "a cut - off can also be introduced by using the real part of the ( complex ) dynamical viscosity @xmath68 $ ]  @xcite giving @xmath69 where in the classical limit @xmath70 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ scissoruni ] , this procedure leads to results which are qualitatively correct also in the collisionless regime .",
    "it is interesting that the expression ( [ rateofloss ] ) yields a damping rate which is exact in the collisionless limit for a trap with cylindrical symmetry ( @xmath71 ) provided @xmath29 is set equal to its value in the collisionless limit , @xmath72 . for a general trap geometry , ( [ rateofloss ] ) with @xmath72 yields a damping rate in the collisionless limit which differs from ( [ collisionless ] ) by the factor @xmath73 where @xmath74 . for the trap parameters of the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite , the factor is @xmath75 .",
    "we now examine the transition between hydrodynamic and collisionless dynamics as a function of interaction strength . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the temperature @xmath76 where the damping is maximum as marking the transition between the hydrodynamic and collisionless regimes . in fig .",
    "[ thfig ] , we plot as a solid line @xmath76 calculated from ( [ determinant ] ) and ( [ tauclass ] ) as a function of the interaction strength @xmath77 .",
    "the gas can be regarded as hydrodynamic below and collisionless above the line .",
    "we also plot the experimentally determined @xmath76 from ref .",
    "as expected , the transition between collisionless and hydrodynamic behavior occurs at lower temperatures with decreasing interaction strength .",
    "there is good agreement between theory and experiment close to the unitarity limit .",
    "however , the calculations do not bring out the observed surprisingly steep decrease in @xmath76 with increasing values of @xmath78 on the bcs side of the resonance .",
    "this could be due to fermi blocking effects making the system less hydrodynamic .",
    "the calculations reported here do not take into account fermi blocking or superfluidity . in the weak - coupling limit ( @xmath79 ) it is straightforward to include fermi blocking effects in the collision integral as described in ref .",
    "the effect of superfluidity was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a uniform superfluid . the viscosity , which is associated with the motion of the normal component , decreases below the transition temperature because of the energy gap in the spectrum of elementary excitations .",
    "the corresponding change in the viscous relaxation rate is numerically quite small ( see eq .  ( 28 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for a trapped superfluid the energy gap depends on position , and it is therefore much more difficult to give a quantitative account of the effects of superfluidity on the mode frequencies .",
    "we have analyzed the scissors mode of an interacting fermi gas in the classical regime . by taking moments of the boltzmann equation , we have calculated the frequency and damping of the mode both as a function of temperature and interaction strength .",
    "the calculation reproduces the main features of the recent experimental findings and can be used to identify non - classical effects for strongly interacting fermi gases .",
