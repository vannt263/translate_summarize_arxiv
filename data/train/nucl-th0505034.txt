    "lattice qcd calculations have predicted a transition from quark - gluon matter ( qgp ) to hadronic matter at high temperature or density @xcite .",
    "this transition was believed to occur around ten microseconds after big bang .",
    "practically , one may obtain this piece of information by studying the relativistic heavy ion collisions at brookhaven national laboratory now .",
    "some possible probes have been proposed for searching for it @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow @xmath1 is one of these probes , from which one may understand some early information in relativistic heavy ion collision through measuring anisotropy of momentum space of particles in final state . some experimental results from bnl - rhic have been published recently @xcite .    as we know ,",
    "hydrodynamical model , which is one method to study relativistic heavy ion collisions , can reproduce @xmath1 data very well below @xmath2 2 gev / c of transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "however , the hadronical rescattering effect on elliptic flow after the hadronization following by the hydrodynamics , at least in our knowledge , has not been investigated in details so far .",
    "based on this motivation , we shall focus the influence of rescattering in hadronic state on elliptic flow @xmath1 .",
    "it should be pointed that hadronic phase space before rescattering is produced directly by an anisotropic momentum space of produced hadrons in order to produce @xmath1 in our calculation , which will be described in detail in following . as a result",
    ", we find that @xmath1 of final particles is suppressed due to the rescattering among hadrons to a considerable extent .",
    "it may indicate that the effect of rescattering among hadrons on @xmath1 is not ignored in the research on @xmath1 .",
    "hydrodynamics of relativistic heavy ion collision @xcite is defined by ( local ) energy - momentum and net charge conservation , @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath6 the net four - current of the @xmath7th conserved charge . here",
    "will only take the net baryon number .",
    "we implicitly assume that all other charges which are conserved on strong - interaction time scale , e.g. , strangeness , charm , and electric charge , vanish locally .",
    "the corresponding four - currents are therefore identically zero , and the conservation equations are trivial",
    ".    for ideal fluids , the energy - momentum tensor and net baryon current assume the simple form : @xmath8 where @xmath9 , p , and @xmath10 are energy density , pressure , and net baryon density in the local rest frame of the fluid , which is defined by @xmath11 = ( @xmath10,@xmath12 ) , respectively . here",
    "= diag(+,-,-,- ) is the metric tensor , and @xmath14 = @xmath15(1,@xmath16 ) the four - velocity of the fluid ( @xmath16 is the three - velocity and @xmath15 = @xmath17 , the lorentz factor ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "the hydrodynamics that we are using assumes cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion with a longitudinal scaling flow profile , @xmath18 though we are investigating the non - central collision .",
    "we recognize that our initial phase space of hadrons in this way is not perfect since we put an initial anisotropy of phase space by hand just after cooper - frye hadronization as illustrated in the following .",
    "nevertheless , we think that it is still useful and interesting to investigate the hadronic rescattering effect on spectra and flow based on this treatment . in this point ,",
    "our simulation is somehow like that we start from an assumed initial phase space of hadrons and then study the hadronic rescattering effect .",
    "this phase space is similar to a sudden hadronization phase space which the partonic anisotropy turns to hadron anisotropy . for hydrodynamics , at @xmath19 = 0 , eqs ( 1 ) reduces to @xmath20 = -(\\frac{v_{t}}{r_{t}}+\\frac{1}{t})(e+p),\\ ] ] @xmath21 = -(\\frac{v_{t}}{r_{t}}+\\frac{1}{t})m,\\ ] ] @xmath22 = -(\\frac{v_{t}}{r_{t}}+\\frac{1}{t})r,\\ ] ] where we defined e @xmath23 @xmath24 , m @xmath23 @xmath25 , and r @xmath23 @xmath26 . in the above expressions",
    ", the index @xmath27 refers to the transverse component of the corresponding quantity .",
    "the equations ( 3)-(5 ) describe the evolution in the @xmath19 = 0 plane . because of the assumption of longitudinal scaling",
    ", the solution at any other @xmath28 0 can be simply obtained by a lorentz boost .",
    "initial conditions for au + au at 200 gev / c in 20 - 40@xmath0 centrality is supposed that initial energy density = 10.3 @xmath29 and initial time = 0.6 @xmath30 , and a hydrodynamical evolution of cylindrically symmetric transverse expansion with a longitudinal scaling flow profile is adopted .",
    "when temperature of liquid reaches to a critical energy density ( = 0.42 @xmath29 ) , a hadronization of qgp which is described by employing the mit bag model eos @xcite will take place . and an ideal hadron gas is established and the corresponding eos is applied .",
    "hadronization in hydrodynamics usually takes the method of cooper and frye @xcite . in this work , however , we make an assumption that the coordinate and momentum spaces of hadronized particles are not isotropic but have shapes as plotted in figure 1 in order to simulate au + au at 200 gev / c in 20 - 40@xmath0 centrality and get @xmath1 in our calculation . here",
    "the mean anisotropy in momentum space , @xmath31px / py@xmath32 , takes 1.18 in our simulation for all produced hadrons .    for the details of the simulation to result in the above anisotropic distributions",
    ", we wrote @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35    @xmath36    @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 ) are the 4-vectors of produced hadrons in coordinate and momentum spaces respectively .",
    "we assume that hadrons are randomly distributed in the overlap coordinate space of two spherical nucleus in terms of the left column of equations ( 7 ) by hadronization . @xmath42 and y are random numbers which are respectively randomly distributed in [ 0,14 ] fm / c and [ -5,5 ] . as for momentum and position of hadrons , @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 denote a random variable distributed in [ 0,4 ] gev and [ 0,7 ] fm , then @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be obtained by the anisotropic factor in momentum and coordinate space , namely @xmath47 , which makes our momentum and coordinate space distribution in transverse plane elliptic and anti - elliptic .",
    "if we make @xmath47 equal to 1 , our hadronization method will go back to the method of cooper and frye . @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the azimuths distributed in [ 0,2@xmath50 in coordinate and momentum spaces .",
    "but here we assume these produced hadrons are from a radial source in which @xmath48 and @xmath49 have a correlation like the equation ( 8) , which means that once a @xmath49 has been decided , the corresponding @xmath48 will be selected in a gaussian distribution whose mean is @xmath49 and whose width is always assumed to be 0.2@xmath51 in our calculation .",
    "the set of equations results in the coordinate and momentum space as figure 1 shows .",
    "here we choose the anisotropic factor @xmath47 in momentum space , equals to 1.18 for 200 gev / c au + au in 20 - 40@xmath0 centrality .",
    "after the hadrons are produced , they enter next rescattering process among them .",
    "we here use the rescattering model from luciae model @xcite .",
    "two particles will collide if their minimum distance @xmath52 satisfies @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total cross section in @xmath55 and the minimum distance is calculated in the c.m.s .",

    "if these two particles are moving towards each other at the time when both of them are formed , the minimum distance is defined as the distance perpendicular to the momentum of both particles .",
    "if the two particles are moving back - to - back , the minimum distance is defined as the distance at the moment when both of them are formed .",
    "assuming that the hadrons move along straight - line classical trajectories between two consecutive collisions it is possible to calculate the collision time when two hadrons reach their minimum distance and order all the possible collision pairs according to the collision time sequence .",
    "if the total and the elastic cross section satisfies @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a random number then the particles will be elastically scattered or else the collision will be considered as an inelastic collision . the distribution of the momentum transfer , @xmath58 , is taken as @xmath59 where @xmath60 , for an elastic scattering , depends on the masses of two scattering particles .",

    "the open and filled points , respectively , stand for the status before and after hadrons rescattering .",
    "we can see that @xmath3 yield and @xmath71 of hadrons is enhanced by rescattering , and also note @xmath71 changes its sign through rescattering . on the other hand ,",
    "elliptic flow @xmath1 of hadrons is suppressed by the rescattering . in order to quantify the extent of enhancement ( or suppression ) at different @xmath3 bins , we define three factors named as @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 by formula ( 14),(15 ) and ( 16 ) .",

    "it indicates the rescattering produced many secondary hadrons , whose @xmath3 seems harder than those hadrons in last generation . in ( d ) , @xmath77 increases with @xmath3 , which indicates that the suppression effect on @xmath1 from hadrons rescattering becomes weaker and weaker with the increasing of @xmath3 . in ( e ) and ( f )",
    ", we see the rescattering turns the shape of coordinate space , and the effect becomes stronger with the increasing of @xmath3 .",
    "it indicates the rescattering makes hadrons momentum space less anisotropy and more heavier particles , more suppression the @xmath1 . while the changes of the tropism of coordinate space occurs in the same time . in our calculation , at least 20 @xmath2 40% @xmath1 will disappear through final hadrons rescattering .",
    "so the effect from final hadrons rescattering on @xmath1 maybe should be considered in order to research early state information in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",

    "\\(i ) we decrease the correlation between momentum space and coordinate space , i.e. increase @xmath83= 0.2@xmath51 to @xmath83 = 0.5@xmath51 .",
    "as we see the circles and squares in figure 5 , the stronger correlation seems to produce more hadrons and suppress @xmath1 more strongly , but its change for the anisotropy of coordinate space @xmath71 is slight .",
    "\\(ii ) we only remain anisotropy of coordinate space when hadronization takes place .",
    "what will happen after rescattering among hadrons ?",
    "the diamons in figure 5 show our results .",
    "obviously , only hadronic rescatterring can not induce @xmath1 if the interaction system has not anisotropy of momentum space before the hadronic rescattering , though its high @xmath76 indicates that more secondary hadrons are produced in rescattering . on the other hand ,",
    "the anisotropy of coordinate space also disappear after hadrons rescattering .",
    "it is also reasonable because the rescattering plays a role that it decreases @xmath1 and tends to make the reaction system isotropic from above , which also is consistent with the isotropic feature of rescattering angle in luciae rescattering model .",
    "so the anisotropy of momentum space , i.e. @xmath1 , may be produced in partonic state before hadronization if the hadronic rescattering has no direction - sense .",
    "in other words , flow must be formed before the hadronization .",
    "\\(iii ) we only remain initial anisotropy of momentum space but lack initial anisotropy of coordinate space when hadronization takes place as shown with triangles in figure 5 , the rescattering still decrease hadrons @xmath1 and creat a big anisotropy of coordinate space @xmath71 .    not only in above three conditions but also in our default condition , we all find that hadrons rescattering produces many secondary hadrons and suppresses the elliptic flow @xmath1 of hadrons to a certain extent .",
    "when the two anisotropy of coordinate and momentum space tend to be homologic with time , the rescattering ends and the reaction system freezes out",
    ".    however , we note that the effect of rescattering on @xmath1 in high @xmath3 domain is not perfect from figure 3 , i.e. , @xmath1 does not overlap with experimental data which saturates above @xmath842 gev / c .",
    "we think that one cause may be from our anisotropic factor in the momentum space .",
    "even though the experimental data can be fitted well in lower @xmath3 , it is a bit artificial since the nucleon distribution of transverse plane ( x , y ) and anisotropic hydrodynamical evolution are not taken into account in this hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the other cause could be the partonic effect on flow , such as partons cascade @xcite and jet quenching @xcite , is also very important for the character of particles with high @xmath3 , which we also do not take into account .",
    "of course , the main goal of this work is to investigate the hadronic rescattering effect on the final state hadronic elliptic flow .",
    "in conclusion , we apply hydrodynamics model followed by the rescattering model to investigate the effect of hadronic rescattering on elliptic flow @xmath1 for 200 gev / c au + au at 20 - 40@xmath0 centrality .",
    "hadronization is treated by cooper - frye method and an initial anisotropic phase space of hadrons is assumed .",
    "we find that the yield of hadrons is increased after the rescattering . while , the rescattering among the hadrons plays a suppression role for @xmath1 , which makes an asymmetric system in momentum space less anisotropic . the suppression becomes weaker with the increasing of transverse momentum .",
    "we miss at least 20 @xmath2 40% @xmath1 after hadronic rescattering in our hydrodynamics + rescattering model .",
    "this may , however , change if hadronization occurs when partons make their last scattering as treated in texas multi - phase transport model when the spatial anisotropic is small @xcite instead of when the energy reaches certain critical energy density presented here . on the other hand ,",
    "the hadronic rescattering makes the coordinate space of hadrons tend to the similar directions to the momentum space . in our model",
    ", we also find that the rescattering does not induce the elliptic flow if only initial anisotropy of coordinate space exists in the hadronic phase .",
    "considering that the hadronic system created in rhic collision is very dense , the following hadronic rescattering may happen potentially and play an important role .",
    "of course , only information of the momentum space after the freeze - out can be measured in experiment .",
    "but anyway , the effect of elliptic flow @xmath1 from final hadronic rescattering deserve attention if the hadronization takes place when the energy reaches certain critical energy density presented here in hydrodynamics .",
