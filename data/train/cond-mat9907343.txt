    "over the last few years , the computer science community has become increasingly aware of the occurrence of phase transitions in hard combinatorial problems @xcite .",
    "when some control parameters are tuned , many problems of practical importance indeed exhibit drastic changes of their behavior .",
    "the interest in such threshold phenomena has been enhanced by the observation that instances located at phase boundaries are the most difficult ones to solve .",
    "even np - complete problems @xcite ( whose solving times are thought to grow exponentially with their sizes ) do not behave so badly far from the threshold . as a consequence , the results of _ worst - case _ complexity theory do not seem to be much relevant in practice and the need for a _ typical - case _ complexity theory has clearly emerged . recently , the use of techniques and concepts of the statistical physics of disordered systems combined with numerical investigations have suggested that the nature of the transition taking place could be related to the upsurge of complexity at the threshold @xcite . this conjecture can be best exemplified on the paradigm of combinatorial problems showing a phase transition behavior , that is the random @xmath9-satisfiability ( @xmath9-sat ) problem .",
    "@xmath9-sat is defined as follows .",
    "consider @xmath10 boolean variables @xmath11 .",
    "choose randomly @xmath9 among the @xmath10 possible indices @xmath12 and then , for each of them , choose a literal that is the corresponding @xmath13 or its negation @xmath14 with equal probabilities one half .",
    "a clause @xmath15 is the logical or of the @xmath9 previously chosen literals , that is @xmath15 will be true ( or satisfied ) if and only if at least one literal is true .",
    "next , repeat this process to obtain @xmath16 independently chosen clauses @xmath17 and ask for all of them to be true at the same time ( i.e. we take the logical and of the @xmath16 clauses ) . for large instances ( @xmath18 ) , numerical simulations and mathematical analysis",
    "indicate that the probability of finding a logical assignment of the @xmath19 s satisfying all the clauses falls abruptly from one down to zero when @xmath20 crosses a critical value @xmath21 . above @xmath21 ,",
    "not all clauses can be satisfied simultaneously .",
    "this scenario is rigorously established for 2-sat which is a polynomial problem and whose threshold @xmath22 equals 1 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath23 , @xmath9-sat is np - complete .",
    "some upper and lower bounds on @xmath24 have been derived and numerical simulations have recently allowed to find estimates of @xmath25 , e.g. @xmath26 @xcite .    when combining @xmath27 of clauses of length 3 with @xmath28 clauses of length 2 , one obtains the so - called @xmath6-sat model , which smoothly interpolates between the instances of the easy - polynomial ( 2-sat when @xmath29 ) and the hard - exponential ( 3-sat when @xmath30 ) classes @xcite .",
    "statistical mechanics and replica theory show that there is a tricritical value @xmath31 separating second - order sat - unsat phase transitions for @xmath32 from random first - order sat - unsat phase transitions for @xmath33 .",
    "the change of the nature of the transition results from a change of the structure of the optimal boolean assignments ( satisfying all clauses when @xmath34 or minimizing the number of violated clauses for @xmath35 ) when crossing the threshold . as shown in @xcite , the sat - unsat transition results from the freezing of a finite fraction of boolean variables which acquire a constant value in all optimal assignments .",
    "the emergence of such over - constrained variables at @xmath36 appears to be continuous when @xmath37 and becomes strongly discontinuous above @xmath38 .",
    "the existence of a @xmath39 backbone of over - constrained variables at the threshold above the tricritical point has deep consequences .",
    "indeed , a common search algorithm such as the davis - putnam procedure will fail with finite probability to correctly assert the first variable and will waste much time in exploring empty branches of the search tree before backtracking and correcting the early mistake .",
    "numerical experiments strongly support this feeling : at the threshold @xmath36 , the running time to solve an instance of the @xmath6-sat problem behaves polynomially with @xmath10 for @xmath40 and exponentially for @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "a further understanding of the sat - unsat transition undoubtedly requires a deeper knowledge of the organization of the optimal assignments .",
    "information about the mutual ( hamming ) distance between solutions , the size of the backbone , etc .",
    "is indeed of high relevance to understand and hopefully improve the efficiency of algorithms . from a statistical physics point of view",
    ", the main difficulty stems from the fact that @xmath9-sat is naturally mapped onto a disordered spin model with finite connectivity .",
    "although the lack of geometrical correlation in the clauses makes this model mean - field , the finite number of neighbours to each spin results in much stronger local field fluctuations and the theory is not as simple as its infinite - connectivity counterpart .",
    "previous studies have shown that even at the simplest replica symmetric ( rs ) level , the order parameter describing finite - connectivity spin - glasses turns out to be a full distribution of effective fields @xcite .",
    "its determination requires to solve a functional self - consistent equation and is far from being easy .",
    "the situation becomes even worse and apparently mathematically intractable ( except in some very peculiar cases @xcite ) when replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) effects are taken into account .    to circumvent the difficulty of solving the rs or rsb self - consistent equations , we propose in this article a different strategy .",
    "our claim is that a variational approach is of high efficiency to provide very precise results at a bearable calculation cost .",
    "using some elementary information about the gross physical features of the @xmath9-sat model , e.g. the existence of a backbone , we show that a rs variational calculation is able to recover all known results and to predict new ones ( under certain assumptions ) such as the value of the tricritical point @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we present some new results obtained from rsb variational calculations in both sat and unsat regimes that unveil the structure of optimal assignments in the @xmath9-sat problem .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  ii ,",
    "we recall the main steps of the statistical mechanics approach to the @xmath9-sat problem @xcite .",
    "we then explain the variational procedure to be followed depending on the particular phase , sat or unsat , under investigation .",
    "section  iii is devoted to the analysis of the structure of optimal configurations in the sat phase .",
    "the sat - unsat transition is studied in section  iv . for both sections",
    "iii and iv , we first focus on the replica symmetric variational solution and then expose the additional features corresponding to replica symmetry breaking effects . finally , the emerging picture of the space of solutions is summed up and some perspectives may be found in section  v.",
    "in this section , we shall give an overview of the statistical mechanics approach to random @xmath9-satisfiability problems , see @xcite for the original works on this subject .",
    "we adopt the ising - spin notion , so a true boolean variable is mapped onto @xmath43 , whereas a false variable gives @xmath44 .",
    "a logical assignment @xmath45 is a set of @xmath10 spins @xmath46 out of all @xmath47 possible configurations . we denote the ( random ) set of clauses by @xmath48 .",

    ", there could well exist a non trivial geometrical organization of the space of solutions to the sat or max - sat problem which would give rise to a non - trivial ( _ i.e. _ not fully concentrated ) probability distribution for @xmath79 .",

    "the strong dependence of @xmath134 on the non - zero field part of the ansatz probably results from the inclusion of small but non - zero rescaled fields into the dirac peak . for 3-sat , differences are less drastic : whereas the upper bound is almost 1 , the above ansatz gives @xmath139 ( and an @xmath134 numerically indistinguishable from 1 for the exponential distribution ) at @xmath140 . in all cases ,",

    "we shall now show under some assumptions exposed in appendix  c that the tricritical point is precisely located at @xmath267 .",
    "to do so , we proceed in two steps .",

    "let us choose @xmath1 with @xmath279 . for ansatz  2 , the free energy @xmath280 vanishes while within ansatz  1 , @xmath281 .",
    "since the free - energy has to be maximized ( see section ii.a ) , the first ansatz has to be preferred to the second one .",
    "consequently , @xmath38 has to be minimized over the choice of possible distributions @xmath212 and an upper bound to the true value of @xmath38 is provided by the minimal value of @xmath38 within the rs variational calculation .",
    "we show in appendix [ appendix2 ] that the latter already equals 2/5 .",
    "the main ingredient into our trial variational function is the separation between the effective fields of order one seen by frozen spins and the fields of order @xmath282 acting on unfrozen spins .",
    "the crucial importance of this separation can be easily seen _ a posteriori _ with a simple gaussian ansatz for @xmath66 , which amounts to set @xmath207 to unity in ( [ f2+p1 ] ) .",
    "in this case , one finds @xmath283 for 3-sat , a rather high value . for 2-sat ,",
    "the situation is even worse : the predicted value for the threshold , @xmath284 is totally wrong while the correct value @xmath231 was successfully obtained by optimizing over @xmath207 .",
    "this result is not surprising : slightly above @xmath285 , there are only few constrained spins whereas the gaussian ansatz with @xmath286 and @xmath287 amounts to consider that all spins are frozen .    besides its technical simplicity",
    ", the variational calculation provides a better understanding of the transition . while the iterative rs scheme used in @xcite was rather involved and the resulting shape of the field distribution remained unclear , the two - parameter variational theory presented here stresses unambiguously the mixed nature of the sat - unsat transition @xcite : of first order with respect to the backbone size @xmath207 and continuous with respect to the intensity @xmath122 of the effective fields related to excited configurations .",
    "however , from a quantitative point of view , the predicted value of @xmath238 is much larger than the numerical result @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy stems from an intrinsic weakness of replica symmetry , which is unable to distinguish between different kinds of frozen spins ( belonging or not to the backbone ) .",
    "as a result , the parameter @xmath207 obtained from the variational rs calculation takes into account all frozen variables and thus overestimates the backbone size .",
    "we shall see in next section how replica symmetry breaking has to be introduced to solve this problem .      the variational calculation exposed in section iv.a as well as the iterative replica symmetric solution of @xcite provide qualitative insights into the physical features of the sat - unsat transition . from a quantitative point of view",
    ", the rs ansatz however fails to predict accurately the threshold of 3-sat : the estimate @xmath288 lies above numerical findings @xmath289 @xcite .",
    "this by itself indicates that a replica symmetry broken ( rsb ) theory of @xmath9-sat has to be sought for @xcite .",
    "another strong hint is of course the appearance of rsb in the ground state structure already in the sat phase , as discussed in sections iii.b and iii.c .",
    "a major qualitative weakness of the rs ansatz underlined in paragraph iv.a.5 lies in its inability to distinguish spins frozen always in the same direction ( backbone ) from spins frozen up and down depending on the particular ground state cluster . for this reason",

    "a large fraction of variables ( approximatively @xmath381 ) becomes over - constrained .",
    "the mixed nature of the sat - unsat transition can be seen explicitely : whereas the fraction of frozen spins jumps up discontinuously , the effective fields measuring the strength of the constraints on each variable grow continuously .",
    "moreover the existence of different clusters of optimal configurations allows the distinction between two groups of over - constrained variables .",
    "the first group ( backbone ) contains variables keeping the same truth value in all optimal configurations . in the second group ,",
    "the variables have a cluster - dependent value .",
    "in other words , optimal configurations corresponding to different thruth values of the second group variables necessarily belong to distinct clusters and lie at @xmath39 distances from each other .",
    "it is important to note that even in the unsat regime these frozen spins coexist with under - constrained variables .",
    "these unfrozen variables lead to a positive entropy at the transition @xcite , a behavior which is intrinsically different from the case of infinite connectivity models @xcite .",
    "besides , we should mention that the actual cluster distribution could be even more complicated , _ e.g. _ through the existence of clusters of clusters _ etc . _",
    "the existence of only two typical distances , and thus the distinction between two kinds of frozen spins is intrinsic to our one - step replica symmetry broken ansatz .",
    "we nevertheless expect that the main qualitative features of @xmath0-sat are already captured in our one - step broken variational description .",
    "finally , we note that in the @xmath6-sat case for @xmath382 the picture arising from the variational calculation is much simpler .",
    "in fact , @xmath163 and @xmath200 coincide and the transition from the under - constrained sat regime to the over - constrained unsat phase is smooth . the geometrically non - trivial intermediate phase does not exist at all .",
    "the exact rs saddle - point equation @xcite shows that the probability @xmath66 that the effective field equals @xmath383 on a given site is bounded from above by the probability that this site is connected to @xmath297 neighbours and then decreases at least exponentially with @xmath297 . combining this observation with the variational calculation presented in this paper , an investigation of the optimization equations over @xmath207 and @xmath384 reveals that slightly above the threshold , the free - energy exhibits a singularity of the type @xmath385 the actual scaling of @xmath386 at large fields @xmath297 gives only rise to logarithmic singularities , e.g. @xmath387 for a gaussian distribution , @xmath388 for an exponential one .",
    "note that equation ( [ singu ] ) also holds at the rsb level within the ansatz ( [ p[rho ] ] ) .",
    "these predictions can be related to the recent finite - size scaling ( fss ) numerical studies of the @xmath9-sat model @xcite .",
    "let us call @xmath389 the average ground state energy for a finite number @xmath10 of boolean variables .",
    "close to the threshold , we expect the curves of @xmath351 as functions of @xmath1 obtained for different sizes @xmath10 to collapse onto each other when properly rescaled .",
    "in other word , fss should hold and there should exist some exponents @xmath390 and @xmath391 such that @xmath392 when @xmath393 and @xmath394 . @xmath390",

    "it has been numerically calculated using a davis - putnam procedure @xcite : @xmath395 for 2+p - sat as long as @xmath32 and @xmath390 decreases for larger @xmath260 down to @xmath396 for 3-sat .",
    "@xmath391 can be simply interpreted : @xmath397 is the minimal number of violated clauses at threshold and thus @xmath398 .",
    "the rescaled ground state energy @xmath399 is a monotonously increasing function of its argument : @xmath400 when @xmath401 ( right boundary of the sat phase ) ; @xmath402 is finite ; @xmath403 when @xmath404 ( left boundary of the unsat phase ) .",
    "the latter scaling ensures that @xmath351 grows above the threshold ( that is at fixed @xmath405 while @xmath10 becomes larger and larger ) as @xmath406 to coincide with ( [ singu ] ) up to logarithmic singularities . imposing that @xmath407 in the unsat regime , identity ( [ scal46 ] )",
    "gives the hyperscaling relation @xmath408 whereas @xmath390 may be computed for large formulae , involving thousands of variables , no such powerful method exists so far to estimate @xmath391 .",
    "therefore , identity ( [ scal47 ] ) may be precious to derive indirectly @xmath391 from the knowledge of @xmath390 .      as discussed in section ii.e",
    ", the threshold @xmath25 separates @xmath312 fields ( sat regime ) from @xmath109 ones ( unsat phase ) .",
    "this change of scaling of effective fields is nicely apparent within the variational calculation presented in sections  iii.a - b and iv.a - b .",
    "looking at compatible anstze for the sat and the unsat phase , the same values for @xmath200 can be obtained either starting from the sat phase from a diverging renormalized variance of the effective fields ( which were assumed to vanish linearly with @xmath51 ) , or coming from the unsat phase from a vanishing variance of the effective fields ( which remained finite in the limit @xmath107 )",
    ". a deeper understanding of the scaling of the fields in the vicinity of the critical point @xmath409 , @xmath316 would be of interest for at least two reasons .",
    "first , it would allow the calculation of the entropy in the unsat phase , which has been out of reach yet .",
    "secondly , the structure of the invariant measure @xmath66 could be studied carefully to gain some information on its singularities , its fractal structure ,  etc . @xcite . at finite but low temperatures",
    ", one might expect that the support of @xmath66 includes different regions corresponding to different scalings with @xmath51 , _",

    ". this potential richness of the order parameter can not be present in infinite - connectivity spin glasses and could give rise to new properties at the mean - field level .",
