    "the disk and bulge of m31 were first resolved into stars by @xcite and @xcite , respectively . since then , many optical surveys have been carried out , including those of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recent papers that included spectra and optical and near - infrared photometry of individual stars are @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "near - infrared point - source photometry of m31 has been hampered by the lack of large - format detectors ; for example , the recent work of @xcite covers only a small portion of m31 .",
    "the 2mass large galaxy atlas @xcite presented integrated photometry of m31 , but no galaxy - wide assessment of the m31 point source population has been published .",
    "spitzer space telescope characterization of the point source population of other local group galaxies includes the large magellanic cloud @xcite , m33 @xcite , and ngc 6822 @xcite .",
    "other local group dwarfs studied include ic1613 and the wlm galaxy @xcite .",
    "the andromeda galaxy , m31 , presents a unique opportunity to study stellar evolution at a chemical composition similar to that of the milky way .",
    "the red giant branch was resolved in v & i by @xcite , and the brightest evolved stars have been studied by @xcite . however , an infrared survey of point sources in m31 has awaited the arrival of the spitzer space telescope @xcite and 2mass @xcite .    in the mid - infrared , integrated measurements of m31",
    "have been made by iras @xcite , cobe / dirbe @xcite , msx @xcite and _ spitzer _ @xcite . with the aim of reaching stars with the most significant mass loss rates this paper presents a point source survey with the irac @xcite and mips @xcite cameras .",
    "we also utilize the 2mass survey in order to include shorter wavelengths .",
    "we present extensive tables , giving positions of the sources we identify , to enable follow - up of these observations .",
    "the irac data and reduction are described in @xcite . briefly , the central @xmath0 of m31 was imaged to a depth of six 12-second frames per position , and the outer area to a size of @xmath1 by four 30-second frames per position .",
    "the survey was part of the spitzer cycle 3 program ( program identification 3126 ) .",
    "the data analyzed here were produced by version 14 of the spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline ; compared to the version 11 and 12 data used by @xcite , the newer version is expected to have more accurate pointing refinement for the individual frames .",
    "the 3000 individual frames per channel were combined with the mopex software to create mosaics with a pixel scale of 086 , sub - sampling the native irac pixel scale by a factor of @xmath2 to better sample the point spread function ( fwhm @xmath3 ) .",
    "the saturation limits given in the irac data handbook correspond to vega magnitudes of @xmath4 for 12-second frames and @xmath5 for 30-second frames for the spitzer 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8   bands respectively .",
    "the sensitivity can be estimated using the ssc performance estimation tool ( http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irac/sens.html ) ; assuming a medium background , the @xmath6 point source detection limits correspond to vega magnitudes of @xmath7 for six 12-second frames and @xmath8 for four 30-second frames .",
    "however , point source photometry in the vicinity of m31 is affected by crowding and at longer wavelengths by the diffuse ism , and these values are presented as a guide only .",
    "the irac flat - fields are derived from observations of the zodiacal light and observations of calibration stars to correct for the fact that the large - scale sensitivity pattern varies with spectral shape .",
    "using the ` photometric correction ' images from the spitzer science center , we constructed correction mosaics and applied them to the m31 mosaics .",
    "we tested two different corrections for alternately red and blue sources and found that the effect was small .",
    "the magnitude changes for the red source correction are @xmath9 in the sense that point sources become fainter and the scatter about this mean is @xmath10 . with the blue source correction",
    "stellar magnitudes in table 1 become brighter by + @xmath11 .",
    "the scatter about these means is @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we have not implemented a correction of this type , as the effect is small , and the conclusions below are unaffected .",
    "the mips resolution ranges from 6 arcsec at 24to 40 arcsec at 160 .",
    "@xcite described the mips program surveying m31 , fit a stellar population plus dust grain model to the spectral energy distribution , and discussed the structure of m31 in terms of its interactions with m32 and ngc 205 .",
    "point sources were extracted from the 7 individual mips 24aor mosaics that together cover approximately @xmath13 degrees centered on m31 .",
    "the point source extraction was done using the psf - fitting program starfinder @xcite using a mips 24   model psf appropriate for stars @xcite .",
    "this method of extracting point source photometry has been extensively tested on lmc spitzer observations @xcite and found to produce high quality point source catalogs at 24 .",
    "point spread functions ( psfs ) were taken from the mopex analysis release by the spitzer science center .",
    "sixteen realizations of the psf differing in pixel phase were constructed for each of the irac channels at the survey pixel scale and combined with daophot @xcite .",
    "two passes were made with the allstar psf - fitting software for each of the four channels , yielding over a quarter of a million point sources at 3.6  with a detection threshold of 2.5@xmath14 . at 8.0  we detected 160,000 sources with the same threshold .",
    "source lists were merged with the daomaster program @xcite , using a 1 pixel matching radius . calibrated",
    "following @xcite , and using aperture corrections based on the psfs , figure 1 is the irac 2-color diagram for these objects .",
    "it resembles the equivalent diagram for the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "dusty evolved stars are offset from the origin in figure 1 . objects with [ 5.8][8 ] @xmath15 1 are young stellar objects and show some concentration to the ring of star formation in m31 @xcite , as seen in figure 2 .",
    "figure 3 compares the luminosity functions in the inner and outer parts of the galaxy .",
    "an estimate of the foreground star and background galaxy contamination may be obtained by comparison with a survey such as swire ( lonsdale 2004 ) .",
    "its lowest galactic latitude field is elais - n2 ; @xmath16 , compared to m31 s @xmath17 .",
    "its irac 2-color diagram is reproduced in figure 4 .",
    "the irac catalog in this field covers @xmath18  deg@xmath19 . to a magnitude limit of [ 3.6 ] = 17 , there are 40,953 objects in the elais - n2 catalog ; scaled to the irac m31 area ( 3.08  deg@xmath19 ) , this corresponds to 29,895 objects , a tenth of the total to 17th mag in m31 .",
    "the color distribution of the swire sources extends further to the red in [ 5.8][8.0 ] than the irac m31 sources , but the m31 sources color extends further to the red in [ 3.6][4.5 ] .",
    "the brighter m31 sources also extend further to the red in [ 3.6][8.0 ] .",
    "all of these properties of the color distributions are consistent with the m31 sources being dominated by stellar objects rather than galaxies , particularly at the faint end .",
    "figure 5 is a color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) depicting massive star evolution in m31 .",
    "most of the stars fall on a strong vertical feature .",
    "these are main sequence and supergiant stars , together with significant contamination from foreground stars . the horizontal feature at [ 3.6 ] = 10 mag shows the growth of circumstellar envelopes radiating at 3001000k .",
    "to enable follow - up of these objects , magnitudes for [ 3.6 ] @xmath20 11 mag are recorded in table 1 .",
    "m31 is only a 29% overdensity for 9 @xmath20 k @xmath20 11 mag in the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "( we determined this by catalog searches in the four cardinal directions around m31 . )",
    "we therefore expect 1/1.29 , 77 @xmath21 6 % , of the entries in table 1 to be foreground .",
    "figure 6 shows the swire control field . scaling the 268 elais - n2 catalog with [ 3.6 ] @xmath20 11 mag to the area of our m31 field",
    ", we expect 196 such objects .",
    "there are 426 stars in the m31 field with [ 3.6 ] @xmath20 11 and measured [ 8.0 ] mags .",
    "if we assume that foreground objects scale as cosec(@xmath22 ) , the estimate of 196 foreground stars becomes 362 , which provides an independent estimate of the percentage foreground contamination of 85 @xmath21 7% .",
    "that is a 2@xmath14 detection of evolved stars in m31 with [ 3.6 ] @xmath20 11 mag .",
    "the maximum luminosity [ 3.6 ] = 9.5 mag corresponds to @xmath23 according to the supergiant bolometric corrections of @xcite for a distance of @xmath24 mag @xcite .",
    "this is a conservative estimate , as @xmath25 = 9.5 $ ] mag exceeds the saturation limits noted in @xmath262 . such high luminosities ( 12.5 @xmath27 ) are reached in the evolution of 120 m@xmath28 stars @xcite .",
    "the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) @xcite at m31 lies at @xmath25 > 14 $ ] mag : all the evolved stars shown in figure 5 are supergiants .",
    "the positions of @xmath29 car and vy cma are represented on the diagram , moved to the distance of m31 .",
    "data for these objects are from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "most of the stars with @xmath25 \\approx 10 $ ] are bluer than these objects : they are presumably in an earlier evolutionary phase of thickening circumstellar envelopes .",
    " [ 8.9 ] @xmath30 2.9 mag , but is considerably fainter than @xmath29 car and vy cma at 3.6 . ]",
    "figure 7 extends deeper into the cmd for m31 . although photometric errors become significant for [ 3.6 ] @xmath31   17 , we see a large number of agb stars , stretching from the tip at 14.4 to the detection limit at 17 mag .",
    "figure 8 is the corresponding swire control field .",
    "we carried out completeness tests by adding artificial stars to the [ 3.6 ] image .",
    "completeness falls to 50% at [ 3.6 ] = 15.5 mag and drops to almost zero at 16.5 mag .",
    "we cross - correlated our catalog with that of @xcite .",
    "over 87,000 matches were found within 1.6 arcsec , but only a handful of these have been spectroscopically classified .",
    "indeed , only 11 of these matches are included in table 1 , and these are ( with two exceptions ) 21st and 22nd v mag stars . luminous blue variables are also known in m31 @xcite , but these have k magnitudes between 13.9 and 17.6 . clearly , there are many stars representing the latest stages of evolution in the stellar population of m31 that are most prominent in the infrared",
    ".    we can also compare the cmd of m31 with that of m33 in figure 9 .",
    "@xcite plot the irac [ 3.6 ]  [ 8 ] color distribution by [ 3.6 ] magnitude in their figure 19 . in m33",
    "m@xmath32 10 consists of agb stars without dust ; the other two histograms are carbon stars with dust .",
    "we consider the carbon star frequency of m31 in the next section .",
    "we cross - correlated our source catalog with the 2mass sky survey @xcite using the openskyquery facility ( http://openskyquery.net/sky/skysite ) of the national virtual observatory .",
    "some 923 matches were found . to go deeper in the near infrared ,",
    "we downloaded a catalog from the ancillary data products of the 2mass extended mission .",
    "this derives from a set of special observations made at the end of 2mass survey operations that used exposure times 6 times longer than the main survey .",
    "these measurements reach @xmath311 mag deeper than the survey .",
    "we found 3110 matches with the 6 @xmath33 catalog within a 1.6 arcsec radius .",
    "figure 10 is a cmd plotted from these matches .",
    "following the deep jhk photometry of m33 by @xcite , the strong vertical feature with j ",
    "k @xmath20 1 and k @xmath20 14.5 is foreground , mixed with m supergiants .",
    "the broader vertical feature with k @xmath15 14.5 are m type agb stars and stars with j  k @xmath15 1.36 are candidate carbon stars .",
    "the principal difference between m31 and m33 , besides the fact that the ukirt m33 photometry goes deeper , is that the branch of carbon stars at k = 16 mag ( in figure 2 ) of @xcite is mostly absent , replaced by a dozen or so stars in m31 at k @xmath30 14 mag .",
    "the product of third dredge up , carbon stars are harder to make in metal rich envelopes @xcite .",
    "@xcite have classified stars in the sage survey of the large magellanic cloud @xcite according to their position in the [ 3.6 ] , j-[3.6 ] cmd .",
    "figure 11 reproduces this classification for an lmc distance modulus of 18.5 @xcite .",
    "supergiants are separated in color from agb m stars , which are in turn separated from agb c stars . in the lmc",
    "this separation is clearly made into distinct concentrations in the hess diagram , in which the rgb tip , the oxygen - rich and carbon - rich agb branches are clearly visible . in m31 the irac/2mass cmd is sparser and noisier , and additional dredge up may be required to overcome additional metallicity and make carbon stars .",
    "classification based on figure 10 may be indicative rather than exact , until spectroscopy can be obtained at 14 @xmath20 [ 3.6 ] @xmath20 16 and j  k @xmath30 2 .    matching with 6@xmath33 2mass allowed spectral energy distributions ( sed ) to be plotted from 18  .",
    "foreground stars will tend to show photospheric seds .",
    "for those stars showing a mid - infrared excess ( defined as a peak at 3.6  or beyond ) , we display seds in figure 12 and magnitudes in table 2 . three broad classes of sources are seen in figure 12 : ( i ) those that peak at 3.6  , ( ii ) sources with a longer wavelength excess , and ( iii ) relatively flat spectrum sources .",
    "the first class are consistent with rather warm circumstellar envelopes ( @xmath311000k ) ; in class ( ii ) the envelope is cooler ( @xmath34500k ) ; class ( iii ) would be consistent with compact hii regions , supernovae remnants , or planetary nebulae , especially if the approximately flat spectrum extends to 24   ( verley 2007 ) . omitted from figure 12 are cases where daomaster failed to match a star at an individual wavelength .",
    "there are approximately 20 such cases for which spurious peaks appear in the sed .",
    "bolometric corrections are not tabulated for stars as red as some of these objects . integrating these seds from 1  10",
    ", we obtain luminosities from 1  20 @xmath33 10@xmath35 l@xmath28 for those that are members of m31 .",
    "the majority of these stars are agb stars with circumstellar envelopes ; there are 12 that are nominally supergiants ( m@xmath36 7 ) , mostly with warm circumstellar envelopes .",
    "we can not rule out that some of these stars may be late type dwarfs in the foreground .",
    "the catalog was also cross - correlated with the long period variable ( lpv ) catalog of @xcite which covers about half of the disk of m31 .",
    "we found 831 sources within 2.5 arcsec of lpvs , triple the number that would have been expected by chance .",
    "the matches appear in table 3 and comprise over 40% of the lpv catalog .",
    "figure 13 is the irac 2-color diagram for lpvs and figure 14 is a color magnitude diagram .",
    "the distribution of points in figure 14 is bounded by the limits of mould , saha & hughes s photometry at j @xmath30 18.5 and the present photometry [ 3.6 ] @xmath30 17 mag . with @xmath37 mag ,",
    "these lpvs have @xmath38 and are agb stars .",
    "this contrasts with the lmc and m33 which show significant numbers of supergiant lpvs with @xmath39 in addition to their agb population @xcite .",
    "over 25,000 sources from 1 jy to 0.2 mjy were extracted from the mips 24  image .",
    "sources that are bright at 24   include hii regions , supernova remnants , and planetary nebulae ( verley 2007 ) .",
    "nevertheless , cross - correlation with the brightest six magnitudes of the irac stellar catalog yielded 599 matches within 1 arcsec , and these are found in table 4 .",
    "sixty matches would have been expected by chance .",
    "figure 15 shows that that many of these matches fall on the dusty stars side of the irac - mips 2-color diagram , rather than the young stellar objects side ( meixner 2006 ) .",
    "j004258.15 + 410731.3 is 667 day period lpv 33133 .",
    "j004031.89 + 410624.7 is 785 day period lpv 16094 .",
    "j004029.18 + 404453.8 is 575 day period lpv 14023 .",
    "these are 3 of the 20 longest periods in the lpv catalog .",
    "their seds are shown in figure 16 .",
    "these can be compared with some of the brighter mips sources in figure 17 .",
    "these extreme period lpvs appear to show two components , a photospheric component , and a dust shell that is relatively cool compared with those illustrated in @xmath265 .",
    "the luminosity function of 24   sources is illustrated in figure 18 .",
    "brighter sources tend to be contained within m31 s ring of star formation and are more likely to be compact hii regions or young stellar objects .",
    "our spitzer space telescope survey reveals a rich population of evolved stars in m31 .",
    "although there is strong foreground contamination , supergiants are present as bright as @xmath40  @xmath41 .",
    "these evolve into stars with extensive circumstellar envelopes like @xmath29  carinae and vy cma in the milky way . a number of the brightest supergiants at 3.6are so red that they will be missed in optical surveys .",
    "we also resolve stars below the tip of the agb to @xmath42  mag .",
    "many of these are lpvs , which also have dusty envelopes .",
    "photometric candidates for agb carbon stars are much fewer in m31 than m33 , but spectroscopy is required to quantify this .    this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
    "support for this work was provided by nasa through an award issued by jpl / caltech .",
    "this work makes use of 2mass data products , a joint project of the university of massachusetts and ipac / caltech , funded by nasa and nsf .",
