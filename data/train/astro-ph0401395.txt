    "double - barred galaxies have been proposed as a means of transporting molecular gas interior to inner lindblad resonances ( ilrs ) where it may fuel starbursts or other forms of nuclear activity @xcite . thus far , double - barred galaxies have been identified predominantly through the analysis of near infrared ( nir ) images ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and manifest themselves as variations in the position angles and ellipticity with galactic radius . a variety of models have been proposed to explain the nature of these nuclear bars , with origins varying from kinematically distinct nuclear bars to nuclear agglomerations that co - rotate at the same speed as the large scale bar @xcite . to allow long - lived nuclear bars ,",
    "these models usually require substantial amounts of dissipative gas to prevent the nuclear stellar populations from suffering rapid kinematic heating and subsequent bar destruction .",
    "there is another class of models that attempt to explain nuclear bars using purely stellar orbits .",
    "it is known that there are different classes of orbits in a barred potential .",
    "the two important ones are the @xmath5 family that runs parallel to the bar major axis , and the @xmath6 family that runs perpendicular to it ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it was thought that the @xmath6 orbits of the large scale bar near the nucleus could form the @xmath5 orbits of the smaller nuclear bar and the corotation radius of the nuclear bar could correspond to the ilr of the large scale bar . in this picture ,",
    "the nuclear bar must _ always _ be aligned perpendicular to the main bar .",
    "@xcite rule out this model by studying a large sample of double - barred galaxies , since they found that not all the observed offset angles between the nuclear bar and the main bar can be explained by inclination effects .",
    "recently , @xcite find that there exist orbits in which particles in a double - barred potential ( where the inner bar rotates faster than the large scale bar ) remain on closed orbits and may form the building blocks of long - lived double - barred galaxies without the need for a gaseous component .",
    "high resolution observations of the dynamics of these galaxies will allow us to test these competing models and learn the true nature of nuclear bars .",
    "of the currently known double - barred galaxies , only a few have been studied in detail using high resolution observations of the molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in @xcite ( @xcite",
    "; hereafter ) we used high resolution co observations to compare the molecular gas distributions of two candidate double - barred galaxies to the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we found that in ngc 2273 the molecular gas emission takes the appearance of a bar - like feature that is aligned with the nir isophote twists . in ngc 5728",
    ", we observed a rather disorderly molecular gas morphology that did not align with the nir morphology , nor did it align with any features seen at other wavelengths in the nuclei of this galaxy .",
    "the similarity in the nir images of these galaxies suggests that the galactic potentials may be similar .",
    "the variety of molecular gas morphologies suggests that the molecular gas may have different properties in each galaxy allowing it to respond differently to these similar potentials . in @xcite ( @xcite ;",
    "hereafter ) we performed a multi - transition co survey of the nuclei of double barred galaxies for which high resolution co maps exist .",
    "we found that the molecular gas was cooler ( and less dense ) in galaxies with more centrally concentrated gas distributions and warmer and denser in galaxies with co emission scattered about the nucleus .",
    "the star formation rates in the galaxies with non - centrally concentrated gas distributions tended to be higher than in the galaxies with strong central concentrations .",
    "this result suggests that either the gas distribution is influencing the star formation activity , or that the star formation may be affecting the gas properties .",
    "the seven galaxies discussed in papers i and ii represent a small fraction of the total number of galaxies known to have nuclear bars ( as indicated by nir isophote twists ) . in order to strengthen the hypotheses of those papers , we need to study a larger sample of galaxies .",
    "of the 93 galaxies studied to date @xcite only 23 contain isophote twists with size scales and position angle offsets large enough to be resolved by the caltech millimeter and bima arrays .",
    "since the larger nir surveys mentioned above were performed using southern observatories , most of the candidates are located in the southern hemisphere . of those 23 galaxies with resolvable bars ,",
    "only 13 are at a declination @xmath730@xmath8 .",
    "six of these ( ngc 470 , ngc 2273 , ngc 4736 , ngc 5850 , ngc 5728 , and ngc 6951 for more details . ] ) have high resolution co maps published (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only ngc 3945 was not included in our sample due to time and source availability constraints .",
    "we have performed a co survey of the nuclei of 10 galaxies known to have strong nir isophote twists in an attempt to find co - bright double barred galaxies that would make good candidates for high resolution mapping .",
    "five of these galaxies ( ngc 2273 , ngc 3081 , ngc 4736 , ngc 5728 , and ngc 6951 ) are discussed in detail in papers i and ii . in  [ obs ]",
    "we discuss the observations and data reduction techniques . in ",
    "[ disc ] we discuss our detections ( and non - detections ) in more detail , and compare our observations to previous studies of these galaxies .",
    "we also determine the molecular gas masses , and discuss the implications of these masses to the double barred galaxy models .",
    "this work is summarized in  [ conc ] .",
    "the nuclei of nine double barred galaxies were observed in @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11using the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) 12-m telescope .",
    "observations were taken in remote observing mode over a 14 hour period on 15 february , 2000 .",
    "the half - power beam width of the nrao 12-m was 29  at 230 ghz ( @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11 ) .",
    "all observations were taken in 2if mode with the millimeter autocorrelator ( mac ) .",
    "the pointing was found to be accurate to 6  for the first half of the evening when we observed our galaxies with ngc @xmath10 4736 .",
    "this is poorer than the normal value for the nrao 12-m , likely due to the high winds . in the second half of the evening",
    "the winds diminished , and the pointing improved to the more normal value of 5  for observations of galaxies with ngc @xmath11 4736 .",
    "the calibration was also monitored by observing spectral line calibrators and planets and the spectral line calibrators agreed with the published values . thus , we adopt the nominal main beam efficiency from the nrao users guide of 0.29 at 230 ghz .",
    "previous co studies of double barred galaxies show co @xmath0=3@xmath12/@xmath0=2@xmath11  line ratios @xmath12",
    "so for galaxies that were not detected with the nrao telescope , we obtained higher resolution @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11  and @xmath9co @xmath0=3@xmath12  spectra using the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) .",
    "these observations were taken over the period of 1999 - 2000 , mostly as part of a bad weather backup project .",
    "the half - power beam width of the jcmt is 21  at 230 ghz ( @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11 ) and 14  at 345 ghz ( @xmath9co @xmath0=3@xmath12 ) .",
    "all observations were obtained using the digital autocorrelation spectrometer .",
    "the calibration was monitored by frequently observing spectral line calibrators .",
    "the spectral line calibrators showed very little scatter from the published values with individual measurements differing by typically @xmath13% from standard spectra .",
    "thus , we adopt the nominal main beam efficiencies from the jcmt users guide of 0.69 at 230/220 ghz and 0.63 at 345 ghz . a detailed observing summary for the jcmt and nrao observations",
    "is given in table [ obstable ] .",
    "similar data sets were averaged together using the software package specx for the jcmt data and the bell labs data reduction package comb for the nrao data .",
    "the data were binned to 10 km s@xmath14 resolution ( 7.7 and 11.5 mhz at 230 and 345 ghz , respectively ) and zeroth or first order baselines were removed .",
    "the emitting regions we detected were quite wide ( @xmath15 300 km s@xmath14 ) but the spectrometer bandwidth was 800 , 800 , and 1200 km s@xmath14 for the nrao and jcmt @xmath0=3@xmath12  and @xmath0=2@xmath11data , respectively , which allowed for accurate baseline determination . for the galaxies where we have no detections ,",
    "the baseline levels were set using the region of the spectrometer outside a 400 km s@xmath14  range centered on the rest velocity of the galaxies ( i.e.@xmath16 km s@xmath14 ) in order to maximize our chances of detecting any weak signal .",
    "the nrao spectra for each galaxy are shown in figure [ nraospectra ] and the jcmt spectra are shown in figure [ jcmtspectra ] . in the cases",
    "where the nrao spectra show no convincing detections , we have included when available the @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11spectra taken at the jcmt and published in ( figure [ morejcmtspectra ] ) .",
    "the spectral line intensities are summarized in table [ masstable ] .    using the @xmath17 temperature scale",
    "would ensure that our observed line strengths are as close to the true radiation temperatures as possible @xcite .",
    "however , conversion to @xmath18 from @xmath19 requires knowledge of the forward scattering and spillover ( @xmath20 ) , which is difficult to measure and was not attempted during the jcmt observing runs . on the other hand , we do have good values for the main beam efficiencies and so an accurate conversion to main beam temperature ( @xmath21= @xmath22/@xmath23 ) is possible .",
    "therefore , we will display our spectra using the main beam temperature scale .",
    "we report our fluxes in table [ masstable ] .",
    "_ ngc 2273 : _ the nrao 12-m detection of this galaxy is not strong .",
    "given the velocity width of the emission and the fact that all the emission is located in the central few arcseconds @xcite the large beam of the 12-m dilutes the emission substantially .",
    "we have jcmt co @xmath0=2@xmath11  and @xmath0=3@xmath12  spectra with strong detections so despite the weak emission in the nrao spectrum for this region we expect to see emission over the velocity range from 1600 to 2000 km s@xmath14 . for completeness",

    "the line would nearly cover the entire spectrometer which makes it difficult to determine the baseline for the spectra of ngc 5728 shown in figure [ nraospectra ] .",
    "we have used the very ends of the spectrometer to determine the baseline level , and the result is a lumpy spectra with no strong noticeable peaks , but a general tendency for the noise to remain slightly greater than zero .",

    "ngc 6951 : _ the nrao 12-m line profile of ngc 6951 ( figure [ nraospectra ] ) is single peaked which is noticeably different than the jcmt @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11  spectrum for this galaxy ( see ) .",
    "the profile of the nrao spectrum more closely resembles the co @xmath0=3@xmath12  spectrum taken with the jcmt at an offset of ( 0,@xmath17 ) as part of our 5-point mapping procedure discussed in .",

    "we have failed to detect co @xmath0=2@xmath11  lines in ngc 2859 , ngc 4340 , or ngc 4371 .",
    "we do not detect any galaxies that have not been previously detected in the co surveys of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "looking at table [ galtable ] suggests that we are predominantly detecting co in later type galaxies , which is a result known from previous studies @xcite , but there is also an apparent trend with nuclear activity .    beside the galaxy names in figures [ nraospectra ] and [ jcmtspectra ] are codes ( in parentheses ) that indicate the types of nuclear activity found in these galaxies .",
    "seyfert 2s are marked as `` s2 '' and liners are flagged with `` l '' @xcite .",
    "galaxies without any detected nuclear activity are not flagged and show no signs of seyfert , liner , or starburst activity .",
    "all of the galaxies that we have detected show signs of nuclear activity . of the four galaxies that we have not detected in co emission ,",
    "none of them show any signs of nuclear activity .",
    "we note that in performing a literature search , the galaxies that we have not detected are quite a bit less studied than ngc 4736 and ngc 6951 , for example , and may harbor as yet undetected nuclear activity which could change our small number statistics noticeably .",
    "the double barred galaxy models of @xcite and @xcite suggest that there needs to be substantial amounts of molecular gas in double barred galaxies .",
    "in fact , the molecular gas inflow in these double barred galaxies may accumulate enough mass so that the nuclear bar can become kinematically distinct @xcite .",
    "thus , we may expect to see high molecular gas masses in the centers of these double barred galaxies .",
    "the intensity of the co emission can be related to the molecular mass using the equation @xmath26 @xcite where @xmath27 is the @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11  flux in jy km s@xmath14 , @xmath28 is the @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11/@xmath0=1@xmath10  line ratio , @xmath29 is the frequency of the emission ( 230 ghz for the @xmath0=2@xmath11transition ) , @xmath30 is the distance to the galaxy in mpc , @xmath31 is the co - to - h@xmath32 conversion factor for that galaxy , and @xmath33 is the galactic value ( @xmath34 @xmath35(k km s@xmath14)@xmath14 , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use 24.7 jy k@xmath14 , 27.8 jy k@xmath14 ( @xmath36= 0.63 , 0.56 ) and 70.6 jy k@xmath14 ( @xmath36= 0.35 ) to convert our jcmt ( @xmath0=2@xmath11 , @xmath0=3@xmath12 ) and nrao @xmath0=2@xmath11  data ( respectively ) from kelvins ( @xmath37 ) to janskys ( @xcite ; jcmt users guide ; nrao 12-m users manual ) .",
    "we assume a coupling efficiency ( @xmath38 ) of 0.7 to correct our observed fluxes to true fluxes .",
    "the co - to - h@xmath32 conversion factor ( @xmath31 ) is a globally averaged property of the galaxy and hence there are uncertainties involved in its use in one specific region of the galaxy and it is only accurate to within @xmath39 30% .",
    "our fluxes are typically accurate to about 10% .",
    "the distances for these relatively nearby galaxies are likely uncertain by at least 30% .",
    "we therefore adopt a total uncertainty of 50% in our mass estimates .    for the galaxies where we have co detections with other telescopes or at other frequencies , we integrate over the velocity range where the emission line was seen . for galaxies with no previous detections , we integrate over a 400 km s@xmath14  range centered on the rest velocity of the galaxy ( this region",
    "was excluded from the baseline subtraction ) . in the cases where the integrated intensity is greater than the rms noise , we give both the integrated intensity and the noise regardless of how insignificant .",
    "we are not claiming these as detections , but are simply using them as a more realistic value for the detection cut - off limit .",
    "if the integrated intensity is less than or equal to the rms noise , the noise value is given as an upper limit .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ masstable ] .",
    "table [ masstable ] shows that there is a wide variety of molecular gas masses in the inner regions of these galaxies . for the galaxies in our sample that have also been detected with the jcmt , we find that the masses determined here typically are lower or agree with the masses determined with co @xmath0=2@xmath11  data in within a factor of two .",
    "the exceptions are ngc 6951 which is lower here by more than a factor three and ngc 4736 which is higher by almost a factor of two .",
    "the discrepancy in ngc 6951 can likely be attributed to the pointing offset discussed in ",
    "the discrepancy in ngc 4736 can likely be attributed to the strong co emission in the spiral arms falling in the larger beam of the nrao telescope @xcite . in any case , the similarities between the masses obtained with the weaker nrao 12-m spectra ( even in the cases where no obvious lines are visible such as ngc 3081 and ngc 5728 ) and the masses obtained with the jcmt @xmath0=2@xmath11  spectra gives us confidence that our mass estimates and upper limits are accurate to at least a factor of two .    of particular interest",
    "is the galaxy ngc 5850 , whose spectrum indicates that there is more than @xmath40 m@xmath3  of molecular gas in the inner 29 .",
    "this mass is comparable to the amount of molecular gas in the entire milky way , but now contained in its inner 2.5 kpc radius @xcite .",
    "the optical size of this galaxy is 43@xmath4137 ( @xmath42 ) , which corresponds to 43@xmath4137 kpc at its distance of 34 mpc .",
    "this clearly makes it the largest galaxy in our sample ( the second runner up is ngc 5728 at 33@xmath4119 kpc ) .",
    "given its rather strong primary bar , it is possible that the large quantity of gas in the inner regions of this galaxy may have been transported inward by the inflow mechanisms known to be associated with bar perturbations . the high resolution co maps of this galaxy @xcite detect only @xmath43 m@xmath3  of molecular gas , mostly concentrated in a small off - center peak of emission approximately 8  north of the galactic center . on the other hand ,",
    "their single dish iram 30-m co @xmath0=1@xmath10  map of the entire primary bar detects @xmath44 m@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite point out that this galaxy is surprisingly quiescent given the large amounts of molecular gas , and propose that the reason for this is that the molecular gas is below the critical surface density for gravitational instabilities @xcite .    the large size of ngc 5850 and the fact that it is the only quiescent galaxy with a strong detection lead us to wonder if we are detecting emission lines in predominantly the largest galaxies ( with possibly the largest molecular gas reservoirs ) .",
    "all the other galaxies are in the 15 to 20 kpc ( major axis ) size range with the exception of ngc 2859 , ngc 5728 , and ngc 5850 who have major axes of 28 , 33 , and 43 kpc respectively .",
    "the strongest line occurs in the closest galaxy , ngc 4736 , which is incidentally one of the smallest in our sample with major axis of @xmath3914 kpc .",
    "so it seems that we are not detecting co emission preferentially in larger galaxies .",
    "since ngc 5850 is the second most distant galaxy in our sample , it also appears that we are not preferentially detecting emission from the closest galaxies .",
    "since we are searching for emission with the co @xmath0=2@xmath11  line , our lack of success in finding bright candidates may not be the result of a lack of molecular gas , but that the gas in these galaxies is very cool and possibly at a low density .",
    "is it possible that all of the molecular emission is dominated by @xmath0=1@xmath10  emission and it is not excited into the @xmath0=2@xmath11  levels enough to be detected ?",
    "in our mass calculation , we assume a @xmath0=2@xmath11/@xmath0=1@xmath10  line ratio of 0.7 . in the local thermodynamic equilibrium approximation , in order to achieve this line ratio , the gas must be at a temperature of only 7 k. this temperature is low enough that it can be maintained by cosmic ray heating @xcite .",
    "higher values of the @xmath0=2@xmath11/@xmath0=1@xmath10  line ratio will act to decrease our molecular gas mass , meaning that the mass values quoted here are likely upper limits .",
    "another possible explanation for the low molecular gas mass may be that the gas is just not located in the inner 29 .",
    "there are observations of other galaxies that contain large molecular rings that seem to have prevented any of the molecular gas from reaching the nucleus ( e.g.  ngc 7331 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will need spectra covering a wider field of view to verify if this is happening in any of these galaxies .",
    "all the galaxies in this survey are known to contain the nir isophote twists believed to be the signature of a double barred galaxy . as mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , the models of double barred galaxies by @xcite and @xcite require large amounts of molecular gas in the nuclear regions of these galaxies in order to sustain long - lived double bars .",
    "the gas requirements vary from 4 to 6% globally @xcite to as little as 2% in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "this gas is required to provide the dissipation needed to prevent the stellar component from dynamically heating so much that the nuclear bar is destroyed .",
    "we point out that we are studying the molecular gas properties in _ only the nuclear region _",
    "so we expect to see gas mass fractions on the order of 2% or more .",
    "the molecular gas content of the galaxies for which we have detections are in agreement with the model requirements and are discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will focus our attention here on the galaxies where we have failed to detect a strong molecular gas component .",
    "these are the galaxies that are difficult to explain in light of the current models of double barred galaxies .    as mentioned in  [ disc ] , the galaxies where we have not detected any co emission are in general less well studied . as such",
    ", we are not able to find direct measurements of the masses of all the galaxies in our sample in the literature .",
    "we have estimated the mass for these galaxies from their blue magnitude ( @xmath45 in @xcite ) .",
    "table [ starmasstable ] shows the apparent blue magnitudes for our sample of galaxies , the absolute magnitude , and the luminosity in solar luminosities .",
    "independent measurements for the masses of some galaxies in our sample exists in the literature .",
    "@xcite determined the dynamical mass of the disk ( the dominant source of the blue light ) of ngc 5728 to be @xmath46 m@xmath3 ; @xcite find the mass of ngc 6951 to be @xmath47 m@xmath3 ; @xcite determine the mass of ngc 4736 to be @xmath48 m@xmath3 .",
    "these masses are in acceptable agreement with our estimates considering the uncertainties associated with our technique .",
    "it seems , though , that our method is underestimating the galaxy mass by a factor of 2 to 4 , which is likely the result of the blue light missing much of the older , redder stellar population of stars in these galaxies .",
    "our estimate therefore provides a lower limit to the true galaxy mass and thus an upper limit to the gas mass fraction .    the limits on the molecular gas masses for the undetected galaxies in our sample range from as high as @xmath49 m@xmath3(for ngc 2859 ) down to @xmath2 m@xmath3  for ngc 4371 .",
    "using the galaxy masses shown in table [ starmasstable ] , this corresponds to a molecular gas mass fraction of 0.07% and 0.05% for ngc 2859 and ngc 4371 , respectively .",
    "these low gas mass fractions suggest that some of these galaxies do not contain enough molecular gas to be able to support the nuclear bars observed in the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are four possible explanations that can bypass this potential problem .",
    "the first possibility is that the molecular gas is not confined to the nuclei of these galaxies .",
    "a circumnuclear co morphology is seen in other galaxies ( e.g. , ngc 7331 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is possible that the molecular gas is outside of the inner 29  covered by the nrao beam for the seemingly gas deficient galaxies in our sample .",
    "we will need co observations over a larger area in order to determine if this is the case , but the models of @xcite still require that the inner kpc contain at least 2% gas . if we assume similar disk and bulge profiles for ngc 2859 as those adopted for ngc 5728 by @xcite , we estimate that roughly one tenth of the stellar mass ( bulge + disk ) is contained in the inner 29  of ngc 2859 .",
    "this translates into a gas to mass ratio of _",
    "0.7% for the inner 3 kpc _ of ngc 2859 , so the lack of co in this galaxy is still a problem for the @xcite model . even if the gas is located in a large ring beyond our nrao 12-m beam , it will be part of the main disk and will not have much of an impact on the cooling of the nuclear regions .",
    "the failure of the large beams of the studies to detect any gas in ngc 2950 , ngc 4340 , or ngc 4371 suggests that the entire disks of these galaxies are very gas poor .",
    "another possibility is that the gas in our galaxies is not in molecular form .",
    "the gaseous components of the models are basically a dissipation mechanism that acts to prevent the stellar components from being dynamically heated .",
    "models of these galaxies generally treat this gas as being primarily molecular , contained in regions of high density and low filling factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "molecular gas also has a higher cooling capacity , since it contains many more emission lines available to it compared to atomic gas .",
    "it would take much more gas to dissipate as much energy as molecular gas .",
    "we have searched the literature for observations of these four galaxies that are undetected in co. only ngc 2859 has been detected in by various authors @xcite .",
    "an mass of @xmath50 m@xmath3  was determined by @xcite for the entire disk of ngc 2859 , which corresponds to a gas mass ratio of 0.5% _ globally _ , which is still less that required by the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , 60 @xmath51 m and 100 @xmath51 m fluxes suggest global star formation rates less than 0.1 m@xmath3/year @xcite , supporting the claim that these galaxies are gas deficient .",
    "the third possibility is that the nir isophote twists are not correlated with the gas properties at all .",
    "it is possible that the nir isophote twists are caused by a triaxial stellar bulge , as originally proposed by @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the lack of molecular gas is not a problem , because there is not much molecular gas in the bulges of galaxies anyway .",
    "evidence against the triaxial bulge model is discussed in where the existence of a nuclear molecular feature that aligns with the isophote twists supports the existence of a true nuclear bar in the disk of ngc 2273 .",
    "in addition , detailed analysis of the nir isophotes indicates that the variations in position angle and bar ellipticity observed in some galaxies can not be the result of triaxial stellar bulges , but must be produced by nuclear stellar bars @xcite .",
    "observations of deprojected nuclear bar / primary bar offset angles have also ruled out the possibility that the isophote twists are the result of collections of stars trapped in @xmath6 orbits @xcite .",
    "finally , if the nir isophote twists are caused by nuclear stellar bars , but we do not see a significant gas mass fraction in the nucleus , our observations thus favor models that can produce nuclear stellar bars without a molecular gas counterpart .",
    "recently , @xcite have discovered a small family of orbits that are capable of sustaining nuclear stellar bars . in light of the lack of gas in some of the galaxies discussed here , we believe that of all models so far , this is the most promising explanation for these instances of double barred galaxies .",
    "it is possible that different mechanisms are at work in different galaxies , and they need to be studied on a case by case basis to determine if the isophote twists are the result of a nuclear bar or a triaxial stellar bulge . in either case , we will need either more sensitive arrays or a sub - millimeter interferometer in the southern hemisphere in order to obtain high resolution co maps for a larger number of these galaxies .",
    "additionally , high resolution studies of the star formation histories of these galaxies will help determine which stage these galaxies occupy in the evolution of double - barred galaxies .",
    "in an attempt to find double barred galaxies that are bright in co emission , we have obtained @xmath9co @xmath0=2@xmath11  spectra for nine galaxies with the nrao 12-m telescope . in the cases where",
    "no emission was found with the nrao 12-m , we obtained higher resolution @xmath9co @xmath0=3@xmath12  and @xmath0=2@xmath11  spectra with the james clerk maxwell telescope .",
    "there is only one additional detection in the jcmt spectra of these galaxies despite reaching sensitivities of 4 mk ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we detect emission in five of these galaxies .",
    "all five galaxies detected exhibit some form of nuclear activity , while the galaxies that were not detected are quiescent and show no signs of any nuclear activity .",
    "thus , within our small sample , the co emission seems to be detected predominantly in galaxies that harbor some form of nuclear activity ( e.g.  seyfert , liner ) .",
    "we note that the quiescent galaxies are less well studied than the active galaxies in our sample , so it may be that they harbor some form of nuclear activity that has yet to be discovered .",
    "some models of double barred galaxies suggest that they should be gas rich in order provide a means of dissipating energy that would otherwise heat the stellar population and subsequently destroy the nuclear bars .",
    "we use the co fluxes to estimate the amount of molecular gas in the centers of these galaxies and we find gas masses that range from @xmath2 m@xmath3  to more than @xmath52 m@xmath3 .    the lack of co and detections places very strict limits on the amounts of gas in these galaxies .",
    "for some galaxies , there must be less than a few @xmath53 m@xmath3  of molecular gas , which ( assuming these galaxies are typical disk galaxies ) corresponds to gas mass fractions of 0.05 to 0.8% ( depending on the assumed mass distribution ) .",
    "these very low gas mass fractions suggest that , contrary to many models , _ large amounts of molecular gas are not required _ to sustain double - bars in the nuclei of some galaxies .",

    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
