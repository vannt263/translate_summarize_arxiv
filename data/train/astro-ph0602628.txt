    "the mpeg movie version is available at ` http://www.projet-horizon.fr/article173.html`.[fig1],width=302,height=226 ]    from the great wall of cfa1 @xcite to the very long filaments seen in the sdss @xcite and the 2df @xcite , the ever growing size of the largest structures observed in the three - dimensional galaxy distribution has remained a challenge to models of large scale structure formation .",
    "it is therefore of prime importance to find a robust way to identify filaments in the universe and to characterize them , through their length , thickness and/or average density . to achieve that , one usually relies on the analysis of the morphological properties through structure functions @xcite , minkowski functionals @xcite , shape finders @xcite of an excursion s connected components in overdense regions of the catalog , which can be obtained using friend - of - friend algorithms @xcite , the minimum spanning tree technique @xcite or percolation on a grid where the density field has been smoothly interpolated @xcite .",
    "this letter works instead in the framework of morse theory @xcite , and uses the approach proposed recently by @xcite ( 2006 , hereafter ncd ) and @xcite ( 2006 , hereafter spcn ) , where filaments are seen as a set of special field lines , departing from saddle points and converging to local maxima while following the gradient of the density field , @xmath7 .",
    "however , the _ skeleton _ thus defined remains non - local , which makes analytical calculations challenging and edge effects difficult to cope with in real catalogs . to solve these issues , a local approximation of the skeleton",
    "was proposed by ncd in the 2d case , and generalized to 3d by spcn .",
    "given the hessian , @xmath8 , and its eigenvalues , @xmath9 , ranked in decreasing order , the _ local skeleton _ is defined as the set of points where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , to ensure that ridges of the density field are probed .",
    "in this paper , the local skeleton is extracted from the sdss dr4 galaxy catalog .",
    "its total length per unit volume is measured and compared to that obtained in @xmath5cdm cosmologies .",
    "relying on realistic mock catalogs , various effects such as incompleteness , survey geometry , cosmic variance , redshift distortions , biasing and non - linear dynamics , are extensively tested .",

    "a large @xmath5cdm simulation was performed , using the publicly available treecode gadget-2 @xcite , involving @xmath23 particles in a @xmath24 box , and with the following cosmological parameters : @xmath25 km / s / mpc , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and normalization @xmath29 .",
    "various mock catalogs were extracted from this simulation , using molusc @xcite .",
    "this tool is designed to build realistic mock galaxy catalogs from dark matter simulations of large volume but poor mass resolution , by reprojecting , as functions of local phase - space density , the statistical properties of the galaxy distribution ( type , spectral features , number density , etc . ) derived from semi - analytic models applied to simulations of higher mass resolution . here , the results calculated by galics @xcite on a treecode simulation with @xmath30 particles in a cube of @xmath31 mpc on a side are used as inputs of molusc . according to the analyses of blaizot et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this simulation should provide sufficient mass resolution to describe realistically the statistical properties of sdss galaxies with @xmath17 .",
    "the advantage of using molusc is that it allows one to probe a realistic volume of the universe without worrying about finite volume or replication effects in the realization of mock catalogs themselves @xcite .    for the purpose of testing the skeleton properties , three different kinds of mock catalogs",
    "were built , all cut at a distance of @xmath32 mpc : ( 1 ) the main catalog is called mock and attempts to reproduce all the characteristics of dr4 - 350 ( redshift space distortion , incompleteness , survey geometry , etc . ) ; ( 2 ) mock - ps is identical to mock but uses the exact positions of the galaxies to test the effect of redshift distortion ; ( 3 ) mock - as is an all - sky version of mock aimed to test the influence of survey geometry and finally ( 4 ) mock - nb is identical to mock but with dark matter particles ( without density biasing ) .",
    "the volume of our simulation is approximately 30 times that covered by dr4 - 350 , which yields an error bar reflecting cosmic variance from the dispersion among 25 random realizations of mock .",
    "note finally that measurements were also performed directly on the dark matter distribution simulation boxes and on the initial conditions of the simulation , to test the effects of nonlinear clustering .",
    "the details of the algorithm used to draw the local skeleton defined in   [ sec : intro ] are given in spcn , so only a brief sketch of it is given here :    \\(i ) _ interpolation and smoothing : _",
    "the first step consists in performing cloud - in - cell interpolation @xcite on a @xmath23 grid covering a @xmath33 mpc cube embedding the survey . to avoid extra degeneracies while drawing the skeleton ,",
    "the empty regions of the cube are filled with a random distribution of galaxies with @xmath34 times smaller average density than inside the survey . at the end of the process , only the parts of the skeleton belonging to the original survey are kept . to warrant sufficient differentiability , convolution with a gaussian window of size @xmath3",
    "is performed prior to computing the gradient and the hessian using a finite difference method . as argued in ncd , in order to avoid contamination by the grid , discreteness and finite volume effects , respectively",
    ", the smoothing scale should verify @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the grid step , @xmath39 the mean interparticle distance and @xmath40 is the survey volume . as a result , the following conservative scale range , @xmath2 mpc , will be used for the measurements performed in this paper .",
    "\\(ii ) _ surface intersection modeling : _ the second step of the algorithm consists in drawing the skeleton , noting that it is embedded in the set of points verifying @xmath41 .",
    "this leads to 3 conditions , @xmath42 , that define 3 surfaces intersecting along a common line .",
    "the actual method used to compute the surfaces @xmath43 as an assemblage of triangles and their intersections as a set of connected lines relies on the classical marching cube algorithm @xcite , as detailed further in spcn .",
    "additional conditions , namely that the gradient should be aligned with the major axis of curvature  in practice , @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the eigenvectors of @xmath46 and @xmath47 are enforced locally after diagonalizing the hessian .",
    "\\(iii ) _ cleaning : _ some additional treatment has to be performed in regions where the field becomes degenerate ( in the vicinity of critical points , @xmath48 ) , as explained in detail in spcn .",
    "finally , the parts of the local skeleton which do not pass through any critical point are removed . as argued in spcn ,",
    "these parts are mostly irrelevant as they do not , in general , correspond to real filaments .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the skeleton measured in dr4 - 350 for 3 smoothing scales @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 mpc , _",
    "( top left and 2 bottom panels ) _ while the measurements of its length , @xmath52 as a function of @xmath3 are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "as expected , the skeleton matches the intuitive visual definition of what a filament is , and its length and complexity increase with the inverse of @xmath3 .",
    "notice on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the prominent features of the skeleton remain mostly independent of smoothing : decreasing @xmath3 essentially adds new branches to the skeleton , corresponding to finer structures in the galaxy distribution . in other words",
    ", the skeleton grows like a tree , while @xmath3 decreases .",
    "the overall scale dependence of the measured length , @xmath53 , is in good qualitative agreement with the expected trivial power - law in the scale - free case , @xmath54 ( spcn ) .",
    "these results match very well the predictions of the standard @xmath5cdm model ( compare mock to dr4 - 350 ) .",
    "this allows one to use the mock catalogs as a solid baseline to test possible observational and dynamical effects on the skeleton , as discussed now , using table  [ tab1 ] as a guideline .",
    "_ incompleteness and discreteness _ effects can simultaneously be tested by comparing dr4 - 350 to its volume - limited counterpart , dr4-vl350 , which probes only 15 percent of the galaxies available in dr4 - 350 ( see the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "they have little impact on the skeleton , changing its length by at most 3 percent .",
    "_ edge effects _ arise from the particular geometry of the sdss .",
    "they can be probed by comparing mock to mock - as .",
    "they have a small but systematic impact on the measured length of the skeleton , which is increasingly overestimated with scale , from about 1 percent for @xmath55 mpc to 8 percent for @xmath49 mpc . in terms of scaling behavior , @xmath56 ,",
    "@xmath57 is therefore slightly underestimated , which explains partly the slight deviation from the expectation @xmath58 , in addition to the scale dependence of the power - spectrum of the density fluctuations .",
    "_ cosmic variance _ should be small : when estimated from the dispersion among 25 realizations of mock , it increases with smoothing scale , as expected , from a 2 percent error for @xmath55 and @xmath59 to a @xmath60 percent error for @xmath49 .",
    "_ redshift distortion _",
    "effects , discussed at length in spcn , can be tested by comparing mock to mock - ps .",
    "they have negligible impact on the measurements , well within the cosmic variance . finally ,",
    "since the skeleton probes overdense regions of the universe and large smoothing scales are considered , the measurements are expected to be rather insensitive to effects of _ biasing _ and to be dominated by the predictions of _ linear _ dynamics .",
    "this has been fully confirmed when comparing the skeleton of simulations at @xmath61 and in the initial conditions , at least in the @xmath5cdm cosmogony framework .",
    "moreover , the small amplitude of the change of length of the skeleton when nonlinear biasing is applied can be checked in table  [ tab1 ] ( compare mock - nb and mock ) .",
    "( @xmath62 mpc)@xmath63 ) as a function of smoothing length for mock catalogs and sdss showing the very good agreement ( as explained in the text ) .",

    "the simulations are @xmath30 dark matter particles of a given @xmath69 km / s / mpc using an eke prescription @xcite for the normalization of the spectrum .",
    "[ fig3],width=302 ]    in this letter a method to probe the filamentary structure in the galaxy distribution , involving the extraction of the _ local skeleton _ from the data and measuring its length per unit volume , @xmath52 , was tested on the sdss and mock catalogs .",
    "the length of the skeleton was found to be a robust statistic in the scaling regime @xmath2 mpc , rather insensitive to nonlinearities , biasing , redshift distortion , incompleteness and cosmic variance .",
    "the results were however slightly affected by edge effects due to the geometry of the sdss ( see table 1 column 6 ) . still , one observes an excellent agreement with the @xmath5cdm concordant model .",
    "( see figure 3 , top panel ) .",
    "one question remains : is the length of the skeleton a discriminant measure of large scale structure ? in theory , the answer is positive : for a gaussian field , @xmath52 depends on the shape of the power - spectrum of density fluctuations , @xmath70 , through its moments of order @xmath71 , @xmath72 , up to @xmath73 , leading to the approximate scaling @xmath74 for @xmath75 ( spcn ) . to demonstrate that this spectral dependence can be used to constrain models of large scale structure in practice , nine flat universe simulations were carried out with gadget-2 , involving @xmath30 particles and with the same cosmological parameters as previously used except that @xmath65 was left as a free variable in the range @xmath76 . from each of the simulations ,",
    "25 mock catalogs were extracted , in which @xmath52 was estimated .",
    "these measurements were used to perform standard @xmath64 analysis to find the best matching value of @xmath65 for the sdss , using mock as reference .",
    "the final @xmath77 constraint is @xmath6 ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that the length of the skeleton is a discriminant estimator ,    which might prove to be a real alternative to traditional two - point statistics estimators which are extremely sensitive to the bias in the nonlinear stage of gravitational instability .",
    "the local skeleton extraction also opens new paths of investigation for the structure analysis of galactic or dark matter distribution , with the prospect of defining quantitatively the locus of filaments .",
    "in particular , it will allow astronomers to carry measurements ( velocity , pressure ... ) along the main motorways of galactic infall @xcite",
