    "the recent release of the 3-year wmap data has stimulated several renewed analyses of cosmological neutrino mass limits .",
    "neutrinos are known to have mass from oscillation experiments so that the unknown overall mass scale is unavoidable as a fit parameter of the standard cosmological model .",
    "the resulting mass limits range from @xmath5  ev ( 95% cl ) using the wmap-3 data alone  @xcite to @xmath6@xmath7  ev ( 95% cl ) when data from the lyman-@xmath8 forest is included  @xcite .    translating cosmological limits on the hot dark matter fraction into neutrino mass limits",
    "depends on the cosmic neutrino density that is fixed by standard physics and thus not an ordinary cosmic fit parameter . on the other hand ,",
    "the most direct evidence for the presence of the cosmic neutrino sea derives from big - bang nucleosynthesis and from cosmological parameter fitting so that it is a natural consistency test to study if the cosmic radiation density implied by the cosmological precision parameters reproduces the standard radiation content .",
    "however , since neutrinos are known to have mass , one can not simply assume that @xmath2 when extracting an allowed range for @xmath0 , the effective number of neutrino species that is the usual measure of the radiation content .",
    "nevertheless this has been the standard procedure in most of the recent parameter analyses based on wmap-3 @xcite .",
    "the caveat is especially relevant because we found a degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath0 , based on the cosmological data available in 2003 @xcite .",
    "one result of our present @xmath1-@xmath0-analysis will be that this degeneracy is no longer present in the much smaller allowed range based on the 2006 data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : old ] ) .",
    "we will thus conclude that the current cosmological data provide essentially independent limits on @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "llll case & model & @xmath1 ( 95%  cl ) & @xmath0 ( 95%  cl ) 1 & @xmath9 & @xmath10 0.62 ev & @xmath11 2 & @xmath12 & @xmath10 0.57 ev & @xmath13 3 & @xmath14 & @xmath10 0.41 ev & @xmath11    another important issue is what one actually means with @xmath15 , as there are several different plausible cases that should be considered .",
    "one possibility is that the cosmic number density of the standard neutrinos is different from what is usually assumed , i.e.  @xmath1 is equally distributed among all species that comprise  @xmath0 ( our case  1 , see table  [ table : cases ] ) .",
    "our second case is that three standard massive neutrinos have equal masses , i.e.  the number of equally massive species is @xmath16 so that @xmath17 signifies additional radiation in some completely new form unrelated to ordinary neutrinos .",
    "finally , we consider @xmath18 that could represent a situation where the standard neutrinos are nearly massless , i.e.  they have hierarchical masses with a largest mass eigenvalue given by the atmospheric scale of about 50  mev , while there is an additional massive species , perhaps a sterile neutrino .",
    "this case is largely motivated to demonstrate that the current cosmological data are sensitive to the @xmath1 distribution among the flavors .",
    "we begin in sec .",
    "[ sec : data ] with a brief description of the cosmological data used in our study . in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] we derive the range of @xmath1 and @xmath0 allowed by these data and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] with a summary of our findings .",
    "in order to study bounds on @xmath1 and @xmath0 we use the same data as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we use distant type  ia supernovae measured by the supernova legacy survey ( snls )  @xcite and large - scale structure data from the 2df  @xcite and sdss  @xcite surveys . from the sdss",
    "we also include the recent measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation feature in the 2-point correlation function  @xcite .",
    "finally , we include the precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy from the wmap experiment  @xcite , as well as the smaller - scale measurement by the boomerang experiment  @xcite .",

    "these data were used previously and very strong separate bounds on @xmath1 and @xmath0 were obtained  @xcite .",
    "however , the strength of these bounds is mainly related to the fact that the lyman-@xmath8 analysis used in ref",
    ".  @xcite leads to a much higher normalisation of the small - scale power spectrum than the wmap data .",
    "other analyses of the same sdss lyman-@xmath8 data find a lower normalisation , in better agreement with the wmap result  @xcite . in this case",
    "the lyman-@xmath8 data add little to the strength of the neutrino mass bound  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between different analyses of the same data probably points to unresolved systematic issues so that we prefer to exclude the lyman-@xmath8 data entirely .",
    "we then perform a likelihood analysis based on a flat , dark - energy dominated model characterised by the matter density @xmath20 , the baryon density @xmath31 , the dark energy equation of state @xmath32 , the hubble parameter @xmath33 , the spectral index of the primordial power spectrum @xmath26 , the running of the primordial spectral index @xmath27 , and the optical depth to reionization @xmath28 .",
    "finally , the normalization of the cmb data @xmath29 and the bias parameter @xmath30 are used as free parameters .",
    "the dark - energy density is given by the flatness condition @xmath34 .",
    "including the neutrino mass @xmath1 , parameterised in terms of the contribution to the present energy density @xmath35 , and the effective number of neutrino species @xmath0 , our benchmark model has 11 free parameters .",
    "our priors on these parameters are shown in table  [ table : priors ] .",
    "the treatment of data is exactly the same as in ref .",
    "when calculating constraints , the likelihood function is found by minimizing @xmath36 over all parameters not appearing in the fit , i.e.  over all parameters other than @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "following these procedures we find the 68% , 95% , and 99% likelihood contours for @xmath1 and @xmath0 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : likelihood ] for the three cases discussed in the introduction and shown in table  [ table : cases ] .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : likelihood ] corresponds to a nonstandard number density of the standard neutrinos , assuming a standard velocity dispersion as in all other cases as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : old ] we overlay these contours with the analogous ones that we found on the basis of the data available in 2003  @xcite . the allowed range of both parameters has shrunk dramatically as expected .",
    "moreover , the pronounced degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 that was present at that time has now completely disappeared , largely thanks to the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements .",
    "we conclude that at the level of precision that has now been reached , the cosmological data constrain @xmath1 and @xmath0 almost independently of each other .",
    "= 7.5truecm    perhaps the physically best motivated case is no .  2 where we have the ordinary neutrinos with mass ( @xmath16 ) and additional radiation in some new form .",
    "in this case we have a hard lower limit @xmath37 . otherwise the contours of the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : likelihood ] are very similar to case  1 ( top panel ) .",
    "the largest modification appears in case  3 where we assume that all hot - dark matter mass resides in a single neutrino species .",
    "the mass limits are significantly more restrictive in this case .",
    "the reason is that for a single massive species the total neutrino energy density is larger in the semi - relativistic regime than if the mass is shared between all flavours @xcite .",
    "since the mass bound is such that neutrinos become nonrelativistic very close to the epoch of matter - radiation equality , this equality occurs later in the model with only one massive neutrino . as a consequence ,",
    "small - scale structure is more suppressed , but the effect can be offset by a slight increase in the matter density .",
    "we indeed observe that the best - fit value of @xmath20 is higher for @xmath38 .",
    "however , both the sn  ia and bao data prefer a low value of @xmath20 and consequently the model with @xmath38 becomes a poor fit to this data at @xmath1 around 0.40.5  ev .",
    "table  [ table : deltachi ] shows exactly this effect . here",
    ", @xmath39 for @xmath40  ev has been broken down into individual contributions from the different data sets . as expected , the main effect comes from sn  ia and bao data .",
    "lcc data set & @xmath41 & @xmath42 cmb & @xmath43 & @xmath44 lss & 0.5 & 0.5 sn  ia & 1.0 & 2.3 bao & 1.3 & 2.9    we finally note that for the case with one sterile massive state and three active , almost massless neutrinos ( the lsnd 3 + 1 case ) the mass bound is 0.45 ev at 95% cl ( 0.93 ev at 99.99% c.l . ) , somewhat lower than the 0.62 ev bound in the standard case . that the bound on the 3 + 1 model is stronger than for the standard case is contrary to what was found in previous studies ( see @xcite .",
    "the reason is the low value of @xmath20 preferred by the bao and sni - a data .",
    "we have derived likelihood contours in the two - dimensional parameter space spanned by @xmath1 and @xmath0 , based on the latest cosmological precision data , however excluding lyman-@xmath8 .",
    "we consider two physically motivated cases for @xmath0 where either the effective number of massive neutrinos differs from the standard scenario , or where there is a new form of radiation besides @xmath16 standard massive neutrinos .",
    "the results for these cases differ very little , except that in case  2 there is hard lower limit @xmath45 .    for the sake of principle we have also considered a third case where all the neutrino mass resides in a single species . here , the mass limit is more restrictive , reflecting that near the limiting mass of around 0.5  ev neutrinos become nonrelativistic very close to the epoch of matter - radiation equality .    for all cases we provide in table  [ table : cases ] limits on @xmath46",
    "after marginalizing over @xmath0 and limits on @xmath15 after marginalizing over @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that the neutrino mass scale can not be avoided as a standard cosmic fit parameter so that one should not derive limits on @xmath0 while enforcing the neutrino masses to vanish . in practice , because @xmath46 and @xmath0 are no longer degenerate , the allowed range for @xmath0 is not very different if one assumes @xmath2 .",
    "the limits on @xmath0 differ little between our cases . independently of the exact distribution of masses among the neutrino species we find @xmath47 ( 95%  cl ) , except in case  2 where the lower limit is by definition @xmath48 .",
    "the bound is significantly stronger than the @xmath49 found with wmap-1 data and without inclusion of the bao data @xcite .",
    "the standard case of three massive neutrinos without modified number density and without additional radiation is well within the 95% cl range of @xmath15 , although it is just slightly outside the 68% cl range in cases  1 and 2 .",
    "either way , the cosmological model with a nonstandard density of massive neutrinos or radiation is not significantly favored over the standard case .",
