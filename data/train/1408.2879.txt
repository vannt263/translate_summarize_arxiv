    "the concept of the well - covered space of a graph was first introduced in 1998 and 1999 by caro , ellingham , ramey , and yuster ( see @xcite and @xcite ) as an effort to generalize the study of well - covered graphs .",
    "brown and nowakowski @xcite , in 2005 , continued the study of this object and , among other things , provided several examples of graphs featuring odd behaviors regarding their well - covered space .",
    "one of these special situations occurs when the well - covered space of the graph is trivial , i.e. when the graph is _ anti - well - covered_. in this work , we prove that almost all levi graphs of configurations @xmath3 are anti - well - covered .",
    "we start our exposition by providing the following definitions and previously - known results .",
    "any introductory concepts failed to be defined here may be found in the books by bondy & murty @xcite and grnbaum @xcite .",
    "we consider only simple and undirected graphs .",
    "a graph will be denoted as @xmath4 , as is customary , where @xmath5 is the set of vertices of the graph and @xmath6 is the set of edges of the graph .",
    "two vertices of a graph are said to be _ adjacent _ if they are connected by an edge .",
    "independent _ set of vertices is one in which no two vertices in the set are adjacent .",
    "if an independent set , @xmath7 , of a graph @xmath8 , is not a proper subset of any other independent set of @xmath8 , then @xmath7 is a _",
    "maximal independent set _ of @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a graph and @xmath9 a field .    1 .",
    "a function @xmath10 is said to be a _ weighting _ of @xmath8 .",
    "if the sum of all weights is constant for all maximal independents sets of @xmath8 , then the weighting is a _",
    "well - covered weighting _ of @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9-vector space consisting of all well - covered weightings of @xmath8 is called the well - covered space of @xmath8 ( relative to @xmath9 ) .",
    "the dimension of this vector space is called the _ well - covered dimension _ of @xmath8 , denoted @xmath11 .    for some graphs , the characteristic of the field @xmath9 makes a difference when calculating the well - covered dimension ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath12 does not cause a change in the well - covered dimension , then the well - covered dimension is denoted as @xmath13 .    in order to calculate the well - covered dimension of a graph , @xmath8",
    ", one would generally need to find all possible maximal independent sets of @xmath8 .",
    "however , finding all maximal independent sets is not always an easy task , as this is a known np - complete problem .",
    "despite the np - complete nature of this problem , let us assume that we have found all possible maximal independent sets of @xmath8",
    ". we will denote these maximal independent sets as @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the well - covered weightings of @xmath8 are determined by solving a system of linear equations that arise from considering all equations of the form @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "when subtraction occurs in each of these equations , we get a homogeneous system .",
    "we can then form an associated matrix , @xmath18 from this homogeneous system of linear equations .",
    "it follows that the nullity of @xmath18 will be the dimension of the well - covered space of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , @xmath19    we now move onto another component of our work : configurations .",
    "[ defconfiguration ] a configuration is a family of points and lines that satisfy these conditions .    1 .",
    "it is a symmetric relation .",
    "incidence is only between a single point and line .",
    "3 .   two points are incident with at most one line",
    ". 4 .   two lines are incident with at most one point .",
    "next , there is some notation for configurations that needs to be set , as well as specific parameters that need to be established for the main result of this work .",
    "[ defconfigurationpara ] we define a @xmath3 configuration as a point - line configuration such that    1 .   there are exactly @xmath20 points incident with each line , and @xmath21 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath22 lines incident with each point , and @xmath23 .",
    "3 .   there are exactly @xmath24 points in @xmath3 , and @xmath25 .",
    "there are exactly @xmath26 lines in @xmath3 , and @xmath27 .",
    "when @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the configuration will be denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "several well - known geometric structures fall into the category of @xmath3 configurations .",
    "for instance :    1 .",
    "a projective plane of order @xmath31 is a @xmath32 configuration , where @xmath31 is the power of a prime .",
    "see figure [ fig : pg(2,3 ) ] for a representation of @xmath33 .",
    "2 .   the pappus configuration is a @xmath34 configuration , and the desargues configuration is a @xmath35 configuration .",
    "3 .   @xmath36 is a @xmath37 configuration , where @xmath31 is the power of a prime .",
    "a generalized quadrangle @xmath38 is a @xmath39 configuration .",
    "the reader is referred to the book by batten @xcite for more information about these important geometric objects .",
    "finally , we define the object , levi graphs , that will connect configurations and graphs .    given a configuration , @xmath40",
    ", we define the _ levi graph _ of @xmath40 , denoted @xmath41 , as the bipartite graph with vertices given by the points and lines in @xmath40 .",
    "the edges of @xmath41 connect a point - vertex @xmath42 with a line - vertex @xmath43 if and only if the point @xmath42 is incident with the line @xmath43 in @xmath40 .",
    "no other edges exist in @xmath41 .     and @xmath44,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "our main result , which will be proven in the following section , combines all these objects as follows :    [ ph(rw ) ] if @xmath45 and @xmath2 , then @xmath46 .",
    "we will prove theorem [ ph(rw ) ] by first proving a technical lemma , that introduces a family of maximal independent sets that will show to be useful later on .",
    "[ mis_gq ] a levi graph of a configuration @xmath3 , where @xmath48 , has at least @xmath49 maximal independent sets .",
    "let @xmath42 be a fixed point in @xmath3 .",
    "we consider the set , @xmath50 , of vertices of @xmath47 given by @xmath42 and all the lines not incident to @xmath42 .",
    "this is an independent set of @xmath47 because there is no incidence between vertices in the set .",
    "moreover , note that if we included another point - vertex to @xmath50 , then that vertex would be adjacent to one of the line - vertices in @xmath50 ( because of condition ( 2 ) in definition [ defconfiguration ] , and the fact that @xmath2 ) .",
    "also , if another line - vertex where to be added to @xmath50 , then this line would have to be incident with @xmath42 .",
    "it follows that @xmath50 is a maximal independent set of @xmath47 .    repeating this construction for all @xmath24 points in @xmath0",
    ", we get @xmath24 distinct maximal independent sets of @xmath47 .    we will now construct another @xmath26 distinct maximal independent sets of @xmath47 .",
    "we start by fixing a line @xmath43 in @xmath0 and then any two distinct points @xmath51 ( recall that @xmath52 ) .",
    "we consider the set , @xmath53 of vertices of @xmath47 given by @xmath54 and all the lines not incident to either of these points .",
    "note that this forms an independent set since adjacency in @xmath47 only occurs if incidence occurs in @xmath3 .",
    "if we try to add in another vertex - point to @xmath53 , since @xmath55 , then this point will be incident to one of the lines not through @xmath56 or @xmath57 and will therefore be adjacent to the vertex - lines in @xmath53 .",
    "if we try to add another vertex - line to @xmath53 , then this line will be incident to one or both @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath53 is a maximal independent of @xmath47 .    repeating this construction for all @xmath26 lines in @xmath0",
    "( it does not matter what pair of points one picks on any given line ) , we get @xmath26 distinct maximal independent sets of @xmath47 .    finally , note that the set of all point - vertices in @xmath47 is a maximal independent set as well as the set of all line - vertices in @xmath47 .",
    "hence , we have constructed @xmath58 distinct maximal independent sets in @xmath47 .",
    "next , we proceed to prove our main result .",
    "we denote by @xmath59 the field of scalars of the well - covered space of @xmath60 , where @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the associated matrix of @xmath8 , and note that @xmath18 has @xmath61 columns . in order to prove that @xmath18 has @xmath61 linearly independent rows we will consider the @xmath58 maximal independent sets in lemma [ mis_gq ] .",
    "we create the first @xmath24 rows of @xmath18 by equating the weight of each of the maximal independent sets @xmath50 to the weight of the maximal independent set consisting of all the lines of @xmath8 . after subtracting we obtain @xmath24 equations of the form",
    "@xmath62 where each @xmath63 is incident with @xmath42 .",
    "it follows that , after organizing the columns of @xmath18 by putting point - vertices first and then line - vertices , the ` first ' @xmath24 rows of @xmath18 are @xmath64 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the incidence matrix of @xmath47 .    in order to obtain the next @xmath26 rows of @xmath18 we will consider maximal independent sets of the form @xmath66 .",
    "for any given line @xmath43 of @xmath0 , we choose ( any ) two points on it .",
    "we will denote these two points as @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we then consider the maximal independent set @xmath53 and equate its weight to the weight of the maximal independent set @xmath67 . after subtracting we",
    "obtain an equation of the form @xmath68 where each @xmath63 is incident with @xmath57 .",
    "note that subtracting equation [ eqmism_p ] ( with @xmath69 ) from equation [ eqmism_ell ] yields @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath43 was arbitrary , we get @xmath70 for every line in @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that since subtracting equations is just a different way to describe row operations in @xmath18 , we get that the ` first ' @xmath61 rows of @xmath18 ( after a few row operations ) are @xmath71 \\mathbf{0 } & i_{b } \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ]    note that addition and subtraction where the only two ( row ) operations needed to obtain the matrix above .",
    "hence , the first @xmath61 rows of @xmath18 do not change depending on the characteristic of @xmath59 .    since the determinant of the matrix above is non - zero ,",
    "the rank of @xmath18 is maximal , and thus @xmath46 .",
    "in this section , we study possible generalizations of theorem [ ph(rw ) ] .",
    "this will be done by providing a few results and by introducing objects for which this theorem could be extended to .",
    "we begin by proving that theorem [ ph(rw ) ] can not be extended to configurations having exactly two lines being incident with every point .",
    "this will be done by an example that considers @xmath72 configurations .",
    "we first notice that a @xmath72 configuration is a disjoint union of polygons / cycles .",
    "this is convenient because disjoint unions of graphs behave well with respect to the well - covered dimension .",
    "in fact , lemma 5 in @xcite says @xmath73 where @xmath74 stands for disjoint union .",
    "@xmath81 is even , for all @xmath72 configurations @xmath40 .",
    "+ moreover , for every @xmath82 , there is a @xmath72 configuration , @xmath83 , such that @xmath84 in particular , the sequence @xmath85 is unbounded .",
    "it is easy to see that a @xmath92 design is a @xmath93 configuration , where @xmath94 .",
    "moreover , a @xmath95 design is a configuration in which every pair of points are ` collinear . ' for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the obvious definition of the levi graph of a @xmath90-design would yield a multigraph .",
    "this apparent setback is not so much of a problem since having one edge or multiple edges between two vertices would mean the same when looking for maximal independent sets .",
    "we claim that the ideas used to prove theorem [ ph(rw ) ] can be generalized to be applicable to block designs .",
    "finally , in this work , we study the well - covered space of the levi graph of any given configuration .",
    "we propose , as an interesting open problem , the study of configurations via understanding the well - covered spaces of their collinearity graphs ( in which points in a configuration are defined as vertices , and adjacency occurs if and only if the points are collinear ) .",
