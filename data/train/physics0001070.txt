    "the study of interaction between vortex structures in a fluid and the free surface is important both from practical and theoretical points of view . in general , a detailed investigation of this problem is very hard .",
    "even the theories of potential surface waves and the dynamics of vortices in an infinite space taken separately still have a lot of unsolved fundamental problems on their own .",
    "only the consideration of significantly simplified models can help us to understand the processes which take place in the combined system .",
    "in many cases it is possible to neglect the compressibility of the fluid as well as the energy dissipation .",
    "therefore the model of ideal homogeneous incompressible fluid is very useful for hydrodynamics . because of the conservative nature of this model the application of the well developed apparatus of hamiltonian dynamics becomes possible @xcite @xcite .",
    "an example of effective use of the hamiltonian formalism in hydrodynamics is the introduction of canonical variables for investigations of potential flows of perfect fluids with a free boundary .",
    "v.e.zakharov showed at the end of the sixties @xcite that the surface shape @xmath0 and the value of the velocity potential @xmath1 on the surface can be considered as generalized coordinate and momentum , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that a variational formulation of hamiltonian dynamics in many cases allows to obtain good finite - dimensional approximations which reflect the main features of the behavior of the original system .",
    "there are several possibilities for a parameterization of non - potential flows of perfect fluid by some variables with dynamics determined by a variational principle .",
    "all of them are based on the conservation of the topological characteristics of vortex lines in ideal fluid flows which follows from the freezing - in of the vorticity field @xmath2 . in particular , this is the representation of the vorticity by clebsch canonical variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite @xcite @xmath5\\ ] ] however , the clebsch representation can only describe flows with a trivial topology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . it can not describe flows with linked vortex lines . besides , the variables @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not suitable for the study of localized vortex structures like vortex filaments . in such cases",
    "it is more convenient to use the parameterization of vorticity in terms of vortex lines and consider the motion of these lines @xcite,@xcite , even if the global definition of canonically conjugated variables is impossible due to topological reasons .",
    "this approach is used in the present article to describe the interaction of deep ( or small ) vortex rings of almost ideal shape in the perfect fluid with the free surface . in the case under consideration",
    "the main interaction of the vortex rings with the surface can be described as the dipole - dipole interaction between `` point '' vortex rings and their `` images '' . moving rings",
    "interact with the surface waves , leading to radiation due to the cherenkov effect .",
    "deep rings disturb the surface weakly , so the influence of the surface can be taken into account as some small corrections in the equations of motion for the parameters of the rings .",
    "in sec.2 we discuss briefly general properties of vortex line dynamics , which follow from the freezing - in of the vorticity field . in sec.3",
    "possible simplifications of the model are made and the point ring approximation is introduced . in sec.4 the interaction of the ring with its image is considered . in sec.5",
    "we calculate the fourier - components of cherenkov surface waves radiated by a moving vortex ring and determine the non - conservative corrections caused by the interaction with the surface for the vortex ring equations of motion .",
    "it is a well known fact that the freezing - in of the vorticity lines follows from the euler equation for ideal fluid motion @xmath6 , \\qquad { \\bf v}=\\mbox{curl}^{-1}\\,{\\bf\\omega } \\ ] ] vortex lines are transported by the flow @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "they do not appear or disappear , neither they intersect one another in the process of motion .",

    "all topological invariants @xcite of the vorticity field are conserved .",
    "the conservation of the topology can be expressed by the following relation @xcite @xmath15 where the mapping @xmath16 describes the deformation of lines of some initial solenoidal field @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the inverse mapping with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "the direction of the vector @xmath19 @xmath20 coincides with the direction of the vorticity field at the point @xmath16 .",

    "it is clear that there is a gauge freedom in the definition of @xmath33 and @xmath35 .",
    "this freedom is connected with the possibility of changing the longitudinal parameter @xmath36 and also with the relabeling of @xmath33 @xmath37    now we again consider the ordinary perfect fluid with a free surface . to describe the flow",
    "entirely it is sufficient to specify the vorticity field @xmath38 and the motion of the free surface .",
    "thus , we can use the shape @xmath39 of the vortex lines as a new dynamic object instead of @xmath38 .",
    "it is important to note that in the presence of the free surface the equations of motion for @xmath39 follow from a variational principle as in the case of infinite space .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the lagrangian for a perfect fluid , with vortices in its bulk and with a free surface , can be written in the form @xmath40\\cdot{\\bf",

    "variation with respect to @xmath39 of the action defined by the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) gives the equation of motion for vortex lines in the form @xmath47=\\frac{\\delta{\\cal h}[{\\bf\\omega[r]},\\psi,\\eta ] } { \\delta{\\bf r } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] this equation determines only the transversal component of @xmath48 which coincides with the transversal component of the actual solenoidal velocity field .",
    "the possibility of solving eq.([transv ] ) with respect to the time derivative @xmath48 is closely connected with the special gauge invariant nature of the @xmath49 $ ] dependence which results in @xmath50    the tangential component of @xmath48 with respect to vorticity direction can be taken arbitrary .",
    "this property is in accordance with the longitudinal gauge freedom .",
    "the vorticity dynamics does not depend on the choice of the tangential component .",
    "generally speaking , only the local introduction of canonical variables for curve dynamics is possible .",
    "for instance , a piece of the curve can be parameterized by one of the three of cartesian coordinates @xmath51 in this case the functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 are canonically conjugated variables .",
    "another example is the parameterization in cylindrical coordinates , where variables @xmath54 and @xmath55 are canonically conjugated .    curves with complicated topological properties need a general gauge free description by means of a parameter @xmath35 .    it should be mentioned for clarity that the conservation of all vortex tube volumes , reflecting the incompressibility of the fluid , is not the constraint in this formalism .",
    "it is a consequence of the symmetry of the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) with respect to the relabeling ( [ nu_relabl ] ) @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "volume conservation follows from that symmetry in accordance with noether s theorem . to prove this statement",
    ", we should consider such subset of relabelings which forms a one - parameter group of transformations of the dynamical variables .",
    "for small values of the group parameter , @xmath57 , the transformations are determined by a function of two variables @xmath58 ( with zero value on the boundary @xmath59 ) so that @xmath60 due to noether s theorem , the following quantity is an integral of motion @xcite @xmath61\\cdot({\\bf r}_2 t_1-{\\bf r}_1 t_2)d\\xi\\ ] ] after simple integrations in parts the last expression takes the form @xmath62\\cdot{\\bf",

    "it is obvious that actually the function @xmath65 does nt depend on time @xmath66 because the function @xmath58 is arbitrary . , where @xmath67 is the label of the tori .",
    "in general case an analysis of the dynamics defined by the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) is too much complicated .",
    "we do not even have the exact expression for the hamiltonian @xmath68 $ ] because it needs the explicit knowledge of the solution of the laplace equation with a boundary value assigned on a non - flat surface .",
    "another reason is the very high nonlinearity of the problem .    in this paper",
    "we consider some limits where it is possible to simplify the system significantly .",
    "namely , we will suppose that the vorticity is concentrated in several very thin vortex rings of almost ideal shape .",
    "for a solitary ring the perfect shape is stable for a wide range of vorticity distributions through the cross - section .",
    "this shape provides an extremum of the energy for given values of the volumes of vortex tubes and for a fixed momentum of the ring .",
    "as already mentioned , volume conservation follows from noether s theorem . therefore some of these quantities",
    "( those of which are produced by the subset of commuting transformations ) can be considered as canonical momenta .",
    "corresponding cyclical coordinates describe the relabeling ( [ nu_relabl ] ) of the line markers , which does nt change the vorticity field .",
    "actually these degrees of freedom take into account a rotation around the central line of the tube .",
    "this line represents the mean shape of the ring and we are interested in how it behaves in time . for our analysis",
    "we do nt need the explicit values of cyclical coordinates , but only the conserved volumes as parameters in the lagrangian .",
    "a possible situation is when a typical time of the interaction with the surface and with other rings is much larger then the largest period of oscillations corresponding to deviations of the ring shape from perfect one . under this condition , excitations of all ( non - cyclical ) internal degrees of freedom are small during all the time , and a variational anzats completely disregarding them reflects the behavior of the system adequately .",
    "the circulations @xmath69 of the velocity for each ring do nt depend on time .",
    "a perfect ring is described by the coordinate @xmath70 of the center and by the vector @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is an oriented area of the ring .",
    "we use in this work the cartesian system of coordinates @xmath73 , so that the vertical coordinate is @xmath74 , and the unperturbed surface is at @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding components of the vectors @xmath70 and @xmath76 are @xmath77 it is easy to verify that the vectors @xmath76 are canonically conjugated momenta for the coordinates @xmath70 . to verify that we can parameterize the shape of each vortex line in the following manner @xmath78 here @xmath79 are complex vectors .",
    "substituting this into the first term of the lagrangian ( [ lagr1 ] ) gives @xmath80{\\bf r}_{\\xi})d\\xi= 2\\pi i\\dot{\\bf r}_0([{\\bf r}_{-1}\\times{\\bf r}_1]+ 2[{\\bf r}_{-2}\\times{\\bf r}_2]+\\dots)+\\ ] ] @xmath81 -2\\pi i\\dot{\\bf r}_1[{\\bf r}_1\\times{\\bf r}_{-2 } ] + \\dots\\ ] ] if we neglect the internal degrees of freedom which describe deviations of the ring from the ideal shape @xmath82 then the previous statement about canonically conjugated variables becomes obvious : @xmath83\\ ] ] such an approximation is valid only in the limit when sizes of rings are small in comparison with the distances to the surface and the distances between different rings @xmath84 these conditions are necessary for ensuring that the excitations of all internal degrees of freedom are small .",
    "obviously , this is not true when a ring approaches the surface . in that case",
    "one should take into account also the internal degrees of freedom for the vortex lines .",
    "the inequalities ( [ dipoles ] ) also imply that vortex rings in the limit under consideration are similar to point magnet dipoles .",
    "this analogy is useful for calculation of the hamiltonian for interacting rings . in the main approximation",
    "we may restrict the analysis by taking into account the dipole - dipole interaction only .",
    "it should be mentioned that in some papers ( see e.g. @xcite and references in that book ) the discrete variables identical to @xmath85 and @xmath76 are derived in a different way and referred as the vortex magnetization variables .    in the expression for the hamiltonian , several simplifications can be made .",
    "let us recall that for each moment of time it is possible to decompose the velocity field into two components @xmath86 here the field @xmath87 satisfies the following conditions @xmath88 the boundary value of the surface wave potential @xmath89 is @xmath90 .",
    "in accordance with these conditions the kinetic energy is decomposed into two parts and the hamiltonian of the fluid takes the form @xmath91 the last term in this expression is the potential energy of the fluid in the gravitational field .",
    "if all vortex rings are far away from the surface then its deviation from the horizontal plane is small @xmath92    the kinetic energy for the system of point rings and their images is the sum of the self - energies of rings and the dipole - dipole interaction between them .",
    "the expression for the kinetic energy of small amplitude surface waves employs the operator @xmath93 which multiplies fourier - components of a function by the absolute value @xmath94 of a two - dimensional wave vector @xmath95 .",
    "so the real hamiltonian @xmath45 is approximately equal to the simplified hamiltonian @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99    with the logarithmic accuracy the self - energy of a thin vortex ring is given by the expression @xmath100 where the small constant @xmath101 is proportional to the conserved volume of the vortex tube forming the ring .",
    "this expression can easily be derived if we take into account that the main contribution to the energy is from the vicinity of the tube where the velocity field is approximately the same as near a straight vortex tube .",
    "the logarithmic integral should then be taken between the limits from the thickness of the tube to the radius of the ring .    in the relation",
    "@xmath102 the potential @xmath103 is approximately equal to the potential created on the flat surface by the dipoles and their images @xmath104    in this way we arrive at the following simplified system describing the interaction of point vortex rings with the free surface @xmath105\\ ] ]    it should be noted that due to the condition ( [ dipoles ] ) the maximum value of the velocity @xmath106 on the surface is much less then the typical velocities of the vortex rings @xmath107 therefore the term @xmath108 in the bernoulli equation @xmath109 is small in comparison with the term @xmath110 .",
    "the lagrangian ( [ tildel ] ) is in accordance with this fact because it does not take into account terms like @xmath111 in the hamiltonian expansion .",
    "now let us for simplicity consider the case of a single ring .",
    "it is shown in the next section , that for a sufficiently deep ring the interaction with its image is much stronger than the interaction with the surface waves .",
    "so it is interesting to examine the motion of the ring neglecting the surface deviation . in this case",
    "we have the integrable hamiltonian for the system with two degrees of freedom @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "the system has integrals of motion @xmath114 so it is useful to consider the level lines of the energy function in the left @xmath115-half - plane taking @xmath116 as the parameter ( see the figure ) .",
    "[ e_levels ]    one can distinguish three regions of qualitatively different behavior of the ring in that part of this half - plane where our approximation is valid ( see eq.([dipoles ] ) ) . in the upper region",
    "the phase trajectories come from infinitely large negative @xmath117 where they have a finite positive value of @xmath118 . in the process of motion",
    "@xmath118 increases .",
    "this behavior corresponds to the case when the ring approaches the surface . due to the symmetry of the hamiltonian ( [ 2df ] )",
    "there is a symmetric lower region , where the vortex ring moves away from the surface .",
    "and there is the middle region , where @xmath118 changes the sign from negative to positive at a finite value of @xmath117 .",
    "this is the region of the finite motion .    in all three cases",
    "the track of the vortex ring bends toward the surface , i.e. the ring is `` attracted '' by the surface .",
    "when the ring is not very far from the surface and not very slow , the interaction with the surface waves becomes significant .",
    "let us consider the effect of cherenkov radiation of surface waves by a vortex ring which moves from the infinity to the surface .",
    "this case is the most definite from the viewpoint of initial conditions choice .",
    "we suppose that the deviation of the free surface from the horizontal plane @xmath75 is zero at @xmath119 , and we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of fields @xmath44 and @xmath120 at large negative @xmath66 .",
    "in this situation we can neglect the interaction of the ring with its image in comparison with the self - energy and concentrate our attention on interaction with surface waves only .",
    "the ring moves in the @xmath121-plane with an almost constant velocity . in the main approximation",
    "the position @xmath122 of the vortex ring is given by the relations @xmath123 @xmath124 the equations of motion for the fourier - components of @xmath44 and @xmath120 follow from the lagrangian ( [ tildel ] ) @xmath125 eliminating @xmath126 we obtain an equation for @xmath127 @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the fourier - transform of the function @xmath130 .",
    "simple calculations give @xmath131 @xmath132 where @xmath133 finally , we have for @xmath129 @xmath134 due to the exponential time behavior of @xmath135 it is easy to obtain the expressions for @xmath136 and @xmath137 . introducing the definition @xmath138 we can represent the answer in the following form @xmath139 @xmath140    the radiated surface waves influence the motion of the vortex ring .",
    "the terms produced by the field @xmath137 in the equations of motion for the ring come from the part @xmath141 in the lagrangian ( [ tildel ] ) .",
    "using eq.([phi_k ] ) for the fourier - transform of @xmath142 we can represent these terms as follows @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 we can use eq.([eta_kt ] ) to obtain the nonconservative corrections for time derivatives of the ring parameters from these expressions .",
    "it is convenient to write down these corrections in the autonomic form @xmath147 @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 can be understood as explicit functions of @xmath153 defined by the dependence @xmath154",
    ". more exact definition of @xmath151 and @xmath152 as @xmath155 and @xmath156 is not necessary .    to analyze the above integrals",
    "let us first perform there the integration over the angle @xmath157 in @xmath95-space .",
    "it is convenient to use the theory of contour integrals in the complex plane of variable @xmath158 .",
    "the contour @xmath159 of integration in our case goes clockwise just around the cut which is from @xmath160 to @xmath161 .",
    "we define the sign of the square root @xmath162 so that its values are positive on the top side of the cut and negative on the bottom side . after introducing the quantities",
    "@xmath163 we have to use the following relations",

    "it can easily be seen that the integrals @xmath172 and @xmath173 have resonance structure at @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "this is the cherenkov effect itself .",
    "now the expressions ( [ dx]-[dpz ] ) take the form @xmath176",
    "@xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179 here the functions @xmath180 are defined by the integrals @xmath181 @xmath182 @xmath183 @xmath184 and @xmath185 is a dimensionless quantity .",
    ", then two parameters appear : @xmath186 and @xmath187 . in that case",
    "one should substitute @xmath188 as the second argument of the functions @xmath189 in the integrals ( [ f1]-[g2 ] ) ] the cherenkov effect is most clear when the motion of the ring is almost horizontal . in this case @xmath190 , and it is convenient to rewrite these integrals without use of complex functions @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 here the square root is the usual positive defined real function .",
    "we see that only resonant wave - numbers contribute to the functions @xmath194 and @xmath195 , while @xmath196 and @xmath197 are determined also by small values of @xmath35 which correspond to the large scale surface deviation co - moving with the ring .",
    "so the effect of the cherenkov radiation on the vortex ring motion is the most distinct in the equations for @xmath156 and @xmath198 .",
    "especially it is important for @xmath116 because the radiation of surface waves is the only reason for change of this quantity in the frame of our approximation .",
    "the typical values of @xmath186 are large in practical situations . in this limit",
    "asymptotic values of the integrals above are @xmath199 @xmath200 and @xmath201 @xmath202 it follows from these expressions that the interaction with the surface waves is small in comparison with the interaction between ring and its image , if @xmath203 .",
    "the corresponding small factors are @xmath204 for @xmath205 and @xmath118 , and @xmath206 for @xmath117 .",

    "it decreases exponentially slowly and this is the main effect of cherenkov radiation .",
