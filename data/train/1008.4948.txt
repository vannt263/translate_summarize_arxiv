    "the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) contain a wealth of cosmological information . in extracting this information from measurements of the cmb , the likelihood function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the theoretical spectrum for some cosmological model , plays an important role .",
    "for gaussian fluctuations , @xmath2 is given by a multivariate gaussian of the observed data ( section  [ multi - gauss ] ) .",
    "for low resolution data ( @xmath3 , defined more precisely later ) in the usual spherical harmonic expansion , it is computationally feasible to evaluate this directly . for high resolution data , it is not , and computationally tractable approximations are required .",
    "fortunately , the large number of independent samples of the universe at high resolution , coupled with a much more nearly diagonal covariance matrix , mean that approximations exist that are accurate as well as fast .",
    "the subject of this paper is the performance of one such high @xmath4 method , the `` xfaster likelihood . ''",
    "a successful high @xmath4 method must account correctly for correlations induced in the angular power spectra by partial sky coverage , non - uniform noise , and non - zero beamwidths , as well as the temperature and polarization cross power .",
    "a number of approaches for high-@xmath4 have been proposed . for temperature alone , these include the gaussian , offset lognormal , equal variance @xcite , wmap @xcite , and scr @xcite likelihood approximations . for temperature and polarization together , these include the offset lognormal bandpower , hamimeche and lewis @xcite , and xfaster @xcite likelihoods .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ multi - gauss ]",
    "we describe the the multivariate gaussian likelihood both in pixel and harmonic space , give an overview of existing high @xmath4 approximations ( section  [ like - approx ] ) and their limitations . an account of their performances applied to simulated planck data has been given in @xcite .",
    "we further test the performance of xfaster likelihood implemented in a new , modified version of the publicly available software ` cosmomc ` code ( @xcite ) by applying it to estimation of cosmological parameters , and compare it to the offset lognormal bandpower likelihood .",
    "we further test our approach to tackle the asymmetry of the beams by comparing parameters estimated for planck simulated data convolved with a symmetric and a asymmetric beam using both likelihood approaches .",
    "pixel temperature fluctuations @xmath5 ( stokes @xmath6 ) on the celestial sphere can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath7 as @xmath8 with coefficients @xmath9 . polarization fluctuations ( stokes @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) can be expanded in spin-2 spherical harmonics , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( grad- or curl - type ) polarization coefficients @xmath15    if the cmb is a gaussian isotropic field , then the probability of a measurement of the sky given a model is described by a multivariate gaussian of the observed data : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the covariance of the data @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the set of model parameters .",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the sky signal and @xmath22 is the noise .",
    "since measurements of the sky are pixelated , the above likelihood is often called the `` pixel - based likelihood '' when estimated in the pixel domain .",
    "it can be evaluated directly if the number of pixels is not too large , but for a full - sky experiment such as planck with 5  pixels it is impossible with current computers .",
    "if the cmb is gaussian , its statistical properties are represented fully by the underlying power spectrum @xmath1 . the multipole harmonic coefficients , @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is @xmath25 , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 ) , on different scales are independent of one another , and we can write @xmath26 the @xmath23 are complex . under the assumption of gaussianity ,",
    "their real and imaginary parts are independent and gaussian distributed , hence their phases are random .",
    "since the cmb is real , they must satisfy @xmath27 .",
    "this means that @xmath28 is real .",
    "for @xmath29 we have @xmath30    for @xmath31 , we have for the real part of the @xmath23 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 similarly for the imaginary part .",
    "combining together all the values of @xmath35 , we find , for a particular @xmath4 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and the normalisation is independent of @xmath38 and @xmath39 . in data",
    "analysis , the measured power spectrum @xmath39 is a fixed quantity , hence the dependence of the likelihood on this value is generally dropped . in this case , up to a constant , we can write the log - likelihood as @xmath40 i.e. , the inverse wishart distribution . if we consider only one measurement , e.g. , one @xmath25-mode or @xmath14-mode , we can write the likelihood function as @xcite @xmath41 i.e. , the inverse gamma distribution , where @xmath1 is the theoretical value of @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 is the measured value .    we can write an exact expression for the likelihood function for our measured power spectrum @xmath44 given the true underlying power spectrum @xmath1 , which is a function of cosmological parameters . since this likelihood",
    "is usually considered in the context of data analysis , it is common to regard the measured @xmath44 as fixed quantities , and to write the likelihood as @xmath45 where the constant depends on @xmath44 . for fixed @xmath44 , this function peaks at @xmath46 .",
    "however if we wish to consider the likelihood as a function of @xmath44 then it is necessary to include the @xmath44-dependence of the likelihood , in which case it should be written as @xmath47 for a fixed underlying power spectrum @xmath1 , this function peaks at @xmath48 .",
    "this is adequate for a full - sky experiment with an infinitely narrow beam and no instrumental noise . for a partial or `` cut '' sky",
    "it is necessary to account for the correlations between the @xmath44 that are introduced .",
    "in addition , real experiments always have non - uniform noise , and must estimate bandpowers ( @xmath49 ) rather than individual @xmath44 .",
    "we need to find an appropriate likelihood function that includes the correct correlations and accounts properly for noise .",
    "although the signal and the noise can be assumed gaussian , the distribution of the band powers is non - gaussian .",
    "this is the so called cosmic biasthe distribution is skewed towards higher @xmath50 values .",
    "this effect is most noticeable at low @xmath51 where cosmic variance of the signal dominates the error bars .",
    "as we will see , the full likelihood includes the cosmic bias whereas the gaussian approximation of the fisher matrix does not .",
    "the joint likelihood for temperature and polarization carries an extra complication in that one has to find an approximation that properly accounts for the temperature and polarization cross power .",
    "we will start by considering the current approximations derived for temperature alone , followed by an account on existing attempts to extend it to a joint likelihood for temperature and polarization .",
    "* gaussian likelihood*the first level of approximation is to use a likelihood that is gaussian in the @xmath44 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a vector of @xmath1 values ( and similarly @xmath54 ) and @xmath55 is the inverse signal covariance matrix .",
    "however this likelihood function is well - known to be biased , ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this gaussian likelihood can be implemented in two ways .",
    "the version discussed in @xcite considers the case where the signal covariance matrix is derived from the measured power spectrum , rather than the theoretical power spectrum .",
    "this results in an overestimation of the errors if the measured power spectrum has fluctuated upwards , and hence upward fluctuations are given less weight , leading to an overall downward bias .",
    "the covariance matrix can instead be computed from the theoretical power spectrum , as used in @xcite , leading to an overestimation of the amplitude .",
    "* offset lognormal likelihood*a better approximation to the likelihood is the offset lognormal approximation @xcite , given by    @xmath56    where @xmath57 and the matrix @xmath58 is related to the inverse covariance matrix by @xmath59 ( the offset factors @xmath60 are simply a function of the noise and beam of the experiment . )",
    "this likelihood function is still slightly biased , but in the opposite direction to that of the gaussian likelihood .    to some extent the offset",
    "lognormal approximation addresses this issue , in that the transformation of variables from @xmath61 to @xmath62 has a constant curvature matrix .",
    "hence the uncertainties on the @xmath63 do not depend on the @xmath64 , avoiding the cosmic bias .",
    "to proceed , assume a normal distribution in this new variable @xmath63 instead of @xmath65 .",
    "the likelihood is now closer to the exact one .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a small bias opposite to that introduced by the gaussian approximation in @xmath65 .",
    "* wmap likelihood*taking advantage of the fact that the bias for the offset lognormal likelihood is opposite to that introduced by the gaussian likelihood , the wmap team defined a likelihood that is a weighted combination of the two @xcite :    @xmath66    this likelihood is a significantly better approximation for the case of a gaussian .",
    "however , the fact that a likelihood function is accurate in the absence of correlations ( when the probability of a measured power spectrum is purely a function of the input power spectrum rather than having any additional dependence on the cosmology ) is not a guarantee that it will perform well when applied to a non - gaussian sky .",
    "for instance , @xcite have shown that the wmap likelihood gives significant biases in the dark energy parameter , @xmath67 , when considering the lensed b - mode power spectrum .    *",

    "* scr likelihood*@xcite developed a new likelihood to tackle the non - gaussianity of the lensed sky for studies of the @xmath14-mode power spectrum ; however , this likelihood has not been extended to the joint probability distribution for all modes . by considering the curvature ( with respect to the measured @xmath44 ) of the exact log - likelihood expression for a gaussian sky ( equation [ eq : exact ] ) at its peak , and also the third derivative , a new likelihood can be derived which is gaussian in @xmath74 , where both the second and third derivatives with respect to @xmath60 take the correct values at the peak of the likelihood .",
    "the scr likelihood approximates the normalised distribution @xmath75 as gaussian in some function of the @xmath44 , and takes the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the covariance matrix of the measured @xmath44 at parameters @xmath80 .",
    "the normalisation is @xmath81 which can be approximated by @xmath82 .",
    "applying this expression to a gaussian simulation gives results almost indistinguishable from the exact likelihood expression , as shown in @xcite .",
    "ignoring the @xmath83 factors , however , is a bad approximation at low @xmath4 , since it ignores the fact that , for a fixed @xmath1 , the peak of the likelihood is slightly below @xmath1 .",
    "this ends up translating to an underestimation of the theoretical power spectrum .",
    "the performance of the gaussian , wmap , and two versions of the scr likelihoods on full - sky lensed simulations was compared in @xcite .",
    "the wmap likelihood function gives very different results to the new scr likelihood function , and shows a significant bias in the dark energy parameter , @xmath67 .",
    "we can not merely extend the above approximations to build a joint likelihood for temperature and polarization .",
    "for instance , assume that we approximate the likelihood for @xmath84 as a gaussian . the mode and variance of the gaussian distribution for @xmath84 depend on @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "hence it is not enough to consider the joint likelihood as a product of independent @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath84 likelihoods . indeed",
    "the trick is to find a way of coupling these components reliably .",
    "furthermore , given that the @xmath84 power spectrum is at times negative , we can not build a joint likelihood as a product of independent offset lognormal likelihoods . as a quick fix , one could try the following :    * offset lognormal bandpower likelihood*this likelihood is a joint likelihood for temperature and polarization built as a gaussian for @xmath84 and offset lognormal for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",
    "however , this approximation does not properly take into account temperature and polarization cross power .",
    "the following two likelihoods , the hamimeche and lewis and xfaster likelihoods , do attempt to take temperature and polarization cross power into account properly .",
    "* hamimeche and lewis ( hl ) likelihood*the @xcite likelihood generalizes the full - sky exact likelihood given by equation  [ exactfullsky ] to the cut sky by considering a quadratic expression of the form @xmath88^{2 } = \\frac{2\\ell+1}{2 } { \\rm tr } \\left [ \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{d}_{\\ell})^{2 } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath89 and @xmath90_{ij } =   g(d_{\\ell , ii})\\delta_{ij}$ ] .",
    "this approximation involves a fiducial model so that the covariance can be pre - computed .",
    "it is assumed that the matrix of estimators @xmath91 is positive / definite , although this assumption may break down for some estimators at low-@xmath4 .",
    "* xfaster likelihood*the xfaster likelihood , introduced in @xcite and @xcite , takes the following form for temperature alone : @xmath92 where a tilde connotes a quantity estimated on the cut - sky .",
    "the power spectrum is parameterized through a set of deviations @xmath93 from a template full - sky spectrum @xmath94 , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the coupling matrix due to the cut sky observations , @xmath97 expresses the effect of a finite beam , and @xmath98 is a transfer or filter function accounting for the effect of pre - filtering the data in both time and spatial domains .",
    "extending to polarization , we have @xmath99 where the matrix @xmath17 is block diagonal : @xmath100 , with each multipole s covariance given by the @xmath101 matrix @xmath102 this likelihood follows intuitively from the full - sky exact likelihood , the inverse wishart distribution , as given by equation  [ exactfullsky ] .      the pixel - based multivariate gaussian likelihood given by equation  [ pblike ]",

    "a full description of the simulations is given in @xcite .",

    "the uncertainties are 23 times better than those for wmap except for @xmath159 estimated with the offset lognormal bandpower likelihood , for which the uncertainty on @xmath159 is 0.015 compared to @xmath1710.007 for xfaster , 0.017 for wmap , and 0.004 for our fisher predictions ( @xcite , table  [ par - wmap - planck - fi ] ) .",
    "parameters estimated with the xfaster and offset lognormal bandpower likelihoods agree well .",
    "as the xfaster likelihood is estimated for individual multipoles , a large number of monte carlo simulations is required for accurate estimates of low-@xmath4 correlations . if only a small number of monte carlo simulations ( such as the 100 used in this study ) , binning of the band power spectrum estimated with xfaster used along with the offset lognormal bandpower likelihood helps to partially correct these correlations . for a large number of monte carlo simulations",
    "this is unnecessary .",
    "there xfaster likelihood , however , has at least three advantages .",
    "first , the offset lognormal likelihood does not properly take into account the temperature - polarization cross power .",
    "this is likely to become evident with a larger number of simulations , or at lower noise levels , such as anticipated with the planck hfi 143ghz channel .",
    "we are investigating this further ; results will be presented in @xcite .",
    "second , the offset lognormal bandpower likelihood requires calculation of a window function .",
    "third , the xfaster likelihood can go straight from maps to parameters ( via its raw pseudo-@xmath65 ) , bypassing the band power spectrum estimation step .",
    "these advantages make xfaster a adequate procedure to estimate cosmological parameters from planck data in the high multipole regime . as a bonus",
    ", xfaster performs reasonably well for moderately low multipoles as well .",
    "although hybridization with a likelihood code able to handle fully the challenges of multipoles less than , say , 40 , will be necessary for the best estimates parameters , xfaster could be used alone where accuracy can be traded for speed .",
    "the work reported in this paper was partially done within the ctp working group of the planck consortia .",
