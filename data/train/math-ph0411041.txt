    "many nonlinear evolution equations have the property that solutions which are initially smooth become singular after a finite time .",
    "the nature of this phenomenon , usually called blowup , has been a subject of intensive studies in many fields ranging from fluid dynamics to general relativity .",
    "the problem whether the blowup can occur , and if so , what is its character , is very difficult for some major evolution equations in physics , such as navier - stokes equations or einstein s equations .",
    "thus , in order to get some insight , it seems useful to study toy models .",
    "this paper is concerned with such a toy model , a nonlinear radial wave equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the radial variable and @xmath2 .",
    "equation ( [ eq ] ) describes equivariant wave maps from the @xmath3 dimensional minkowski spacetime into the three - sphere ( see @xcite for the derivation ) . in the physics literature this model",
    "is usually referred to as the sigma model .    the central question for equation ( [ eq ] )",
    "is whether solutions starting from smooth initial data @xmath4 may become singular in future ?",
    "a hint towards answering this question comes from the scaling argument .",
    "note that equation ( [ eq ] ) is scale invariant : if @xmath5 is a solution , so is @xmath6 . under this scaling the conserved energy @xmath7= \\int\\limits_0^{\\infty } \\left(u_t^2 + u_r^2 +    \\frac { 2 \\sin^2\\!{u}}{r^2}\\right ) \\ : r^2 dr\\ ] ] transforms as a homogenous function of degree one : @xmath8=\\lambda e[u]$ ] , which means that equation ( [ eq ] ) is supercritical in the language of the theory of nonlinear partial differential equation . for supercritical equations",
    "it is energetically favorable that solutions shrink to small scales so singularities are expected to develop from sufficiently large ( in a suitable norm ) initial data . although there are no rigorous results in this respect for equation ( [ eq ] ) , an explicit example of a singularity forming from smooth initial data is known .",
    "this example , first pointed out by shatah @xcite and later found in closed form by turok and spergel @xcite is provided by the self - similar solution @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a constant is the ground state of a countable family of self - similar solutions @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "however , all @xmath13 solutions are unstable so they do not appear in the dynamics for generic initial data . ] . since @xmath14 the solution @xmath15 becomes singular at the center when @xmath16 . by the finite speed of propagation",
    ", one can truncate this solution in space to get a smooth solution with compactly supported initial data which blows up in finite time .",
    "in fact , the self - similar solution @xmath17 is not only an explicit example of singularity formation , but numerical simulations indicate that it appears as an attractor in the dynamics of generic initial data @xcite .",
    "we conjectured in @xcite that generically the asymptotic profile of blowup is universally given by @xmath17 , that is @xmath18 to prove this conjecture one needs to understand the mechanism responsible for the process of local convergence to the self - similar solution @xmath17 .",
    "such a mechanism is relatively well - understood for nonlinear diffusion equations where the global dissipation of energy is responsible for the convergence to an attractor , however very little is known for conservative wave equations where the local dissipation of energy is due to dispersion . in this paper , as the first step towards proving the above conjecture , we describe in more detail how the limit ( [ conj ] ) is attained . to this end ,",
    "in section 2 we consider the problem of linear stability of the solution @xmath17 .",
    "this leads to an eigenvalue problem which is rather unusual from the standpoint of spectral theory of linear operators . in section 3",
    "we solve this problem using the method of continued fractions .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present the numerical evidence that the deviation of the dynamical solution from the self - similar attractor is asymptotically well described by the least damped eigenmode .",
    "in order to analyze the problem of linear stability of the self - similar solution @xmath17 it is convenient to define the new time coordinate @xmath19 and rewrite equation ( [ eq ] ) in terms of @xmath20 @xmath21 in these variables the problem of finite time blowup in converted into the problem of asymptotic convergence for @xmath22 towards the stationary solution @xmath15 .",
    "following the standard procedure we seek solutions of equation ( [ rho - tau ] ) in the form @xmath23 . neglecting the @xmath24 terms we obtain a linear evolution equation for the perturbation @xmath25 @xmath26 substituting @xmath27 into ( [ pert ] ) we get the eigenvalue equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 we consider equation ( [ spectrum ] ) on the interval @xmath30 , which corresponds to the interior of the past light cone of the blowup point @xmath31 . since a solution of the initial value problem for equation ( [ eq ] ) starting from smooth initial data remains smooth for all times @xmath32 , we demand the solution @xmath33 to be analytic at the both endpoints @xmath34 ( the center ) and @xmath35 ( the past light cone ) . such a globally analytic solution of the singular boundary value problem can exist only for discrete values of the parameter @xmath36 , hereafter called eigenvalues .    a straightforward way to find the eigenvalues would be to use the frobenius method .",
    "the indicial exponents at the regular singular point @xmath34 are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , hence the solution which is analytic at @xmath34 has the power series representation @xmath39 since there are no complex singularities in the open disk of radius @xmath40 about @xmath34 , the series ( [ v0 ] ) is absolutely convergent for @xmath41 . at the second regular singular point , @xmath35 , the indicial exponents are @xmath42 and @xmath43 so , as long as @xmath36 is not an integer ( below we shall discuss this case separately ) , the two linearly independent solutions have the power series representations @xmath44 these series are absolutely convergent for @xmath45 . if @xmath36 is not an integer then only the solution @xmath46 is analytic at @xmath35 . from the theory of linear ordinary differential equations",
    "we know that the three solutions @xmath47 , @xmath46 , and @xmath48 are connected on the interval @xmath49 by the linear relation @xmath50 the requirement that the solution which is analytic at @xmath34 is also analytic at @xmath35 serves as the quantization condition for the eigenvalues @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , the explicit expressions for the connection coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 are not known for equations with more than three regular singular points . in the next section",
    "we shall present an indirect method which goes around this difficulty .",
    "we remark in passing that alternatively the eigenvalues can be computed numerically using a shooting - to - a - midpoint technique . with",
    "this technique one approximates the solutions @xmath47 and @xmath46 by the power series ( [ v0 ] ) and ( [ v12 ] ) , truncated at some sufficiently large @xmath54 , and then computes the wronskian of these solutions at a midpoint , @xmath55 , say . the zeros of the wronskian correspond to the eigenvalues .",
    "although this technique generates the eigenvalues with reasonable accuracy , it is computationally very costly , especially for large negative values of @xmath36 , because the power series ( [ v0 ] ) and ( [ v12 ] ) converge very slowly .",
    "note also that shooting towards @xmath35 fails completely for large negative @xmath36 because the solution @xmath48 is subdominant at @xmath35 , that is , it is negligible with respect to the analytic solution @xmath46 .",
    "in this section we shall solve the eigenvalue problem ( [ spectrum ] ) using a method which exploits an intimate relationship between recurrence relations and continued fractions .",
    "although this method is not widely known , it is in fact quite old and has been applied in the past to determine the bound states of the hydrogen molecule ion @xcite and quasinormal modes of black holes @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to determine the analyticity properties of the power series solution @xmath47 from the asymptotic behavior of the expansion coefficients @xmath56 . in order to implement this idea",
    "it is convenient to change the variables @xmath57 in terms of these variables equation ( [ spectrum ] ) takes the form @xmath58 y ' -\\frac{1}{4 }      [ \\lambda^2 x(1-x)+9 x^2 - 17x+4 ] y = 0.\\ ] ] the reason of making the transformation ( [ subs ] ) is twofold .",
    "first , the transformation of the independent variable rearranges the singular points of equation ( [ spectrum ] ) in such a way that , without changing the points @xmath34 and @xmath35 , moves the bothersome singularities at @xmath59 ( which lie on the unit disk around @xmath34 and obstruct the analysis of analyticity of the power series ( [ v0 ] ) at @xmath35 ) to infinity and moves @xmath60 to @xmath61 .",
    "second , by factoring out the singular behavior at @xmath61 the number of terms in the recurrence relation for the coefficients of the power series solution around @xmath62 is reduced from four to three .",
    "the indicial exponents at @xmath62 are @xmath40 and @xmath63 so the solution which is analytic at @xmath62 has a power series expansion @xmath64 substituting this series into equation ( [ neweq ] ) we get the three - term recurrence relation @xmath65 with the initial conditions @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( normalization ) where @xmath68 the series ( [ y0 ] ) is absolutely convergent for @xmath69 and in general is divergent for @xmath70 . in order to determine the analyticity properties of the solution @xmath71 at @xmath72 we need to find the large @xmath54 behavior of the expansion coefficients @xmath73 . the three - term recurrence relation ( [ 3term ] ) can be viewed as the second order difference equation so it has two linearly independent asymptotic solutions for @xmath74 .",
    "following standard methods ( see , for example , @xcite ) we find @xmath75 where the coefficients @xmath76 can be determined recursively from ( [ 3term ] ) .",
    "thus , in general the solution of the recurrence relation ( [ 3term ] ) behaves asymptotically as @xmath77 if the coefficient @xmath78 is nonzero then @xmath79 hence the power series ( [ y0 ] ) is divergent for @xmath70 ( in fact , it has a branch point singularity at @xmath72 ) . on the other hand , if @xmath80 then @xmath81 and the power series ( [ y0 ] ) is absolutely convergent for @xmath82 , in particular the solution @xmath71 is analytic at @xmath72 .    the advantage of replacing the quantization condition @xmath51 in the connection formula ( [ connect ] ) by the equivalent condition @xmath80 follows from the fact that @xmath78 is the coefficient of the dominant solution in ( [ 3termasym ] ) , in contrast to @xmath53 which is the coefficient of the subdominant solution in ( [ connect ] ) . in the theory of difference equations ( recurrence relations ) a subdominant solution , that is a solution which is asymptotically negligible with respect to any other solution ,",
    "is called the minimal solution .",
    "in contrast to a dominant solution , the minimal solution , if it exists , is unique .",
    "the condition @xmath80 is thus equivalent to the requirement that the solution of the recurrence relation ( [ 3term ] ) starting with @xmath66 and @xmath67 is minimal . in order to find",
    "when this minimal solution exists we shall use now a relationship between three - term recurrence relations and continued fractions .",
    "let @xmath83 then , we can rewrite ( [ 3term ] ) as @xmath84 and applying this formula repeatedly we get the continued fraction representation of @xmath85 @xmath86 pincherle s theorem @xcite says that the continued fraction on the right hand side of equation ( [ pinch ] ) converges if and only if the recurrence relation ( [ 3term ] ) has a minimal solution @xmath87 and , moreover , in the case of convergence , equation ( [ pinch ] ) holds with @xmath88 for each @xmath54 .",
    "using pincherle s theorem and setting @xmath89 in ( [ pinch ] ) we obtain the eigenvalue equation @xmath90 the continued fraction in ( [ eigen ] ) , which by pincherle s theorem is convergent for any @xmath36 , can be approximated with essentially arbitrary accuracy by downward recursion starting from a sufficiently large @xmath91 and some ( arbitrary ) initial value @xmath92 .",
    "the roots of the transcendental equation ( [ eigen ] ) are then found numerically ( see table 1 ) .",
    "@xmath93    .the first twelve eigenvalues . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath93    a glance at table 1 shows some interesting properties of the spectrum .",
    "first , all the eigenvalues are real .",
    "second , there are no eigenvalues @xmath94 .",
    "third , there are two integer eigenvalues @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "below we discuss these properties in detail .",
    "we find this property surprising because we can not see any a priori reason which forbids complex eigenvalues . on the contrary , it is easy to deform the potential @xmath97 in equation ( [ spectrum ] ) , without changing the character of singularities at the endpoints , in such a way that the resulting eigenvalues are complex . thus , the reality of eigenvalues is related to the special form of the potential @xmath97 .",
    "it remains a puzzle whether this relationship is accidental or there is something deep to it .",
    "this eigenvalue is due to the freedom of changing the blowup time @xmath98 . to see this ,",
    "consider a solution @xmath99 with shifted blowup time . in terms of the similarity variables @xmath19 and @xmath100 we have @xmath101 thus , the perturbation induced by the shift of blowup time has the form @xmath102 and consequently the mode @xmath103 solves equation ( [ spectrum ] ) with @xmath95 . since this mode is evidently analytic at both @xmath34 and @xmath35 ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath95 is an eigenvalue .",
    "we emphasize that this positive eigenvalue should not be interpreted as the physical instability of the solution @xmath17 , as it is an artifact of introducing the similarity variables and does not show up in the dynamics for @xmath5 .",
    "using the transformation @xmath104 we can put equation ( [ spectrum ] ) into a standard sturm - liouville form @xmath105 in the space of functions @xmath106,\\frac{d\\rho}{(1-\\rho^2)^2}\\right)\\ ] ] the operator @xmath107 is self - adjoint so the eigenvalues @xmath108 are real .",
    "both endpoints are of the limit - point type .",
    "near @xmath34 an admissible ( that is , belonging to @xmath109 ) solution behaves as @xmath110 .",
    "near @xmath35 two independent solutions behave as @xmath111 so only the solution @xmath112 with @xmath113 is admissible .",
    "now , we shall show the operator @xmath107 has no eigenvalues . to see this , note that the solution with @xmath114 , corresponding to the gauge mode @xmath115 has no zeros .",
    "this implies by a standard theorem for sturm - liouville operators that there are no eigenvalues below @xmath114 . since @xmath114 is not an eigenvalue ( because the mode ( [ zeromode ] ) does not belong to @xmath109 )",
    ", we conclude that the operator @xmath107 has the purely continuous spectrum @xmath116 .",
    "what does this fact tell us about the eigenvalues of our problem ? rewriting ( [ mu ] ) in terms of @xmath36 we have @xmath117 so comparing with ( [ trans ] ) we see that only @xmath112 leads to a solution @xmath33 which is analytic at @xmath35 . for @xmath118",
    "the solution @xmath112 belongs to @xmath109 so in this case there is one - to - one relationship between the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath107 and the eigenvalues of our problem . since the former has no eigenvalues , we infer that our problem has no eigenvalues with @xmath118 .",
    "this result was obtained previously in @xcite .",
    "we point out that for @xmath119 the requirements of square - integrability and analyticity near @xmath35 are mutually exclusive so in this case there is no relationship between between the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath107 and the eigenvalues of our problem .",
    "if @xmath120 is a positive integer then the two linearly independent power series solutions of equation ( [ neweq ] ) around @xmath72 are @xmath121 the solution @xmath122 , corresponding to the larger indicial exponent , is analytic at @xmath72 but the solution @xmath123 , corresponding to the smaller indicial exponent , involves a logarithm in general .",
    "however , for @xmath124 we have an exceptional case : the coefficient @xmath125 vanishes and both solutions are analytic at @xmath72 .",
    "the best way to see this is to solve the recurrence relation for the coefficients @xmath126 assuming temporarily that the solution @xmath127 contains no logarithm .",
    "we find @xmath128 where @xmath129 is a polynomial in @xmath36 of order @xmath130 .",
    "moreover this polynomial has no integer roots .",
    "when @xmath120 is a positive integer different from @xmath131 , then the expansion coefficient @xmath132 does not exist which contradicts the assumption that @xmath127 contains no logarithm .",
    "the only exception is @xmath124 because the denominator in ( [ ince ] ) has no @xmath133 term .",
    "thus , for @xmath96 the singularity at @xmath72 is apparent - each solution which is analytic at @xmath62 is automatically analytic at @xmath72 as well .",
    "this proves that @xmath96 is the eigenvalue .",
    "according to the linear stability analysis presented above the convergence of the solution @xmath5 towards the self - similar attractor @xmath17 should be described by the formula @xmath134 where @xmath135 are the eigenmodes corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath136 and @xmath137 are the expansion coefficients . in order to verify ( [ numer ] )",
    "we solved equation ( [ eq ] ) numerically for large initial data leading to blowup , expressed the result in the similarity variables , and computed the deviation from @xmath17 for @xmath138 . the result",
    "( see figure 1 ) shows that , in perfect agreement with the formula ( [ numer ] ) , the deviation from @xmath17 is described by the least damped eigenmode @xmath139 .",
    "this makes us feel confident that the calculation presented in section 3 contains no algebraic errors .",
    "we remark that the formula ( [ numer ] ) could be used to compute the eigenvalues numerically directly from the dynamics rather than by solving the eigenvalue equation .",
    "such a computation was performed by donninger @xcite with the result which is in rough agreement with table 1 ( rough , as the dynamical computation of eigenvalues is by far less accurate than the continued fraction method ) .",
    "i thank tadek chmaj for remarks and providing the numerical data for section 4 , and roland donninger for informing me about his numerical results .",
    "this research was supported in part by the kbn grant 2 p03b 006 23 .",
