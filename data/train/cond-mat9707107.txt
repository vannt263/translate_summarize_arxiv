    "recent observations of bose - einstein condensation in alkali gases confined to harmonic potentials @xcite has led to an extensive study of the ground state and low energy properties of trapped interacting bose gases .",

    "the use of such time- and computer memory consuming methods puts severe limitations on the size of the system one may describe . on the other hand , it is for such systems the corrections to mean - field calculations are important .    the results presented here are therefore not immediately relevant for the experiments performed with trapped bose gases so far .",
    "our aim is rather to gain some insight into the effects of the approximations which form the basis of the mean - field theories mentioned above , in the limit of small particle numbers .",
    "we are also interested in effects which are specific to one and two dimensions .",
    "in addition , future experiments in lower dimensions may explore the range of parameters used here .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows . in the next section we recall the many - body formalism and describe the steps leading to the diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian .",

    "in the following we present the results of the numerical diagonalization of the many - body hamiltonian . in one dimension we have truncated the many - body basis at cut - off energy @xmath73 .",

    "although one might study this by the method used here , we can not derive any decisive results as far as the condensation temperature is concerned .",

    "<S> we discuss the dependence of these quantities on both interaction strength @xmath0 and particle number @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state properties are compared to the predictions of the gross - pitaevskii equation , and the agreement is surprisingly good even for relatively low particle numbers . </S>",
