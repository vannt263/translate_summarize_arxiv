    "it is universally accepted as one of the key technologies for @xmath0 g systems due to its significant advantages in terms of lower expenses , flexibility and enhanced spectral efficiency . in particular",
    ", c - ran enables the implementation of coordinated multipoint ( comp ) schemes across all the ratio units ( rus ) connected to the central processing unit ( cu ) in the `` cloud '' @xcite . the main obstacle to the realization of the promises of c - ran resides in the restrictions on the capacity and latency of the so - called fronthaul links that provide connectivity between rus and the cu ( see @xcite for a review and fig .",
    "[ fig : sm ] for an illustration ) .",
    "the standard design of digital fronthauling , that is , of the transmission of digitized baseband complex samples on the fronthaul links , is based on either scalar quantization , as in the common public radio interface ( cpri ) standard , or on more sophisticated _ point - to - point _",

    "have been studied for both the uplink and the downlink ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , for the uplink , distributed source coding , which can be implemented by means of wyner - ziv coding , was demonstrated to yield significant performance gains by leveraging _ joint decompression _ at the cu @xcite@xcite . in a dual fashion , for the downlink , a form of _ joint compression _ , known in network information theory as _ multivariate compression _ , was shown to be advantageous in @xcite . in both cases , the design and performance gains of joint decompression or joint compression depend on the density of the deployment of rus in the network and rely on some degree of channel state information ( csi ) regarding the uplink or downlink channels at the cu .",
    "the results reviewed above concerning the advantages of joint fronthaul processing at the cu were derived under a non - constructive asymptotic information - theoretic framework that assumes long coding blocks and only asserts the existence of coding schemes that achieve given performance bounds . in this paper , instead , we consider the downlink of a c - ran and investigate the design of a quantization algorithm that implements the idea of multivariate compression put forth in @xcite and is hence referred to as multivariate quantization ( mq ) .",
    "we specifically focus on a practical implementation that operates on a symbol - by - symbol basis . hence",
    ", as compared to conventional cpri , mq only requires changes in the cu processing , whereby quantization is performed jointly , rather than separately , on the baseband signals intended for multiple rus , while no modification is needed at the rus , which still perform scalar decompression .",
    "furthermore , following the theoretical insights of @xcite on the benefits of joint optimization of fronthaul compression and downlink precoding , we propose an algorithm for the joint design of mq and beamforming .",
    "next , to tackle the computational complexity issue of mq , we propose a reduced - complexity mq by means of successive block quantization .",
    "finally , we investigate the potential advantages of complementing scalar quantization with variable - length compression by designing an entropy - constrained version of mq .",

    "each symbol @xmath7 may be taken from a finite constellation with uniform probability or it may be assumed to be distributed as a zero - mean complex gaussian variable .",
    "the latter case is often appropriate so as to obtain a modulation - independent solution or to account for ofdm transmission in the time domain by the law of large numbers as in e.g. , @xcite@xcite .    in order to enable multi - user transmission ,",

    "we observe that quantization only affects the interference power in ( [ eq : effsnr ] ) and hence optimal quantizers should minimize the powers @xmath27 $ ] for all @xmath28 . to tackle this multiobjective problem , following the standard scalarization approach @xcite ,",

    "we also note that ( [ eq : wmse ] ) differs from standard quantization error metrics , such as the error vector magnitude ( evm ) or mean squared error @xcite-@xcite , since ( [ eq : wmse ] ) directly captures the overall system performance while the mentioned metrics apply on a per - fronthaul link basis ( see also sec .",

    "in this section , we present intuitive arguments to illustrate the basic principles and potential benefits of mq .",
    "this is done by contrasting mq with standard point - to - point quantization ( ptpq ) that operates separately on each fronthaul link . to this end , we focus on the case of a single ue , i.e. , @xmath30 and two ru , i.e. , @xmath31 , and assume for simplicity of visualization a real - valued system model . moreover , to further simplify the discussion , we adopt the matched beamformer @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the @xmath34 ( real ) channel vector for the given ue , and we have dropped the ue subscript to simplify the notation . the transmitted signal ( [ eq : precode_x ] ) can hence be written as @xmath35 , and some realization of @xmath36 are shown as dots along the @xmath37 degree line in fig .",

    "the figure also shows as squares on the horizontal and vertical axes the quantization levels that define the quantization codebooks @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the two rus .",
    "the two codebooks yield quantization points on the plane given by the indicated cross markers .",
    "note that the codebooks are the same for both conventional ptpq ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cb](a ) ) and mq ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cb](b ) ) , as further discussed below .",
    "as mentioned , each ru is informed only about its own codebook .",
    "because of quantization , the signal @xmath42 sent by two rus must correspond to one of the quantization points ( crosses ) on the plane . therefore , the quantization error @xmath43 between the desired signal , which lies on the @xmath44 line , and the selected point ( cross ) should be considered as a disturbance to the reception of the ue .",
    "the key observation is that the impact of the quantization error @xmath43 on the reception of the ue depends , by ( [ eq : rec_sig])-([eq : effsnr ] ) , solely on the power @xmath45 of its projection on the @xmath44 line .",
    "that is , the only component of the quantization error that affects the ue is its projection onto the signal subspace .",
    "[ fig : cb](a ) illustrates the quantization regions resulting from standard uniform ptpq of the signals to be transmitted by the two rus .",
    "as seen in the figure , with ptpq , the shape of the quantization regions is constrained to be rectangular .",
    "therefore , it is not possible for the cu to shape the quantization regions as a function of current csi so as to minimize the projection of the quantization error onto the subspace occupied by the signal .",
    "the limitation identified above can be alleviated by mq , whereby quantization is performed jointly for the two rus , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cb](b ) .",
    "we emphasize again that the same quantization codebooks are used as for ptpq so that the rus need not be informed about any change in the operation at the cu as a function of current csi .",
    "an optimized shape of the quantization region with mq , using algorithms to be discussed in the rest of this paper , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cb](b ) . as seen in the figure",
    ", mq enables the shaping of the quantization regions , with the aim of allowing a finer control of the impact of the quantization error on the received signals . in the example of fig .",
    "[ fig : cb](a ) , in particular , the quantization error is such that the projection onto the subspace occupied by the signal is minimized .",
    "mq hence plays a complementary role to precoding : while precoding decides which `` spatial directions '' should be occupied by the signal , mq controls which `` spatial directions '' are mostly affected by the quantization error .",
    "in this section , we study the baseline case in which the precoding matrix @xmath46 is fixed and the quantization codebooks are also given .",
