    "in recent years , after many very successful studies of the close - to - threshold production of mesons in proton - proton collisions  @xcite , several experimental groups have extended the range of their investigations to proton - neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained can then be compared with theoretical models of the production of mesons in different isospin channels and this reduces significantly the ambiguities of such models . however , the experiments and the evaluation of the data from the proton - neutron interaction are much more difficult than measurements of proton - proton reactions .",
    "this is mainly due to having to use nuclear targets as a source of neutrons . in order to define the full kinematics of the @xmath5 events one needs to measure at least one more particle than for the analogous meson production in proton - proton scattering",
    "this is because the determination of the four - momentum vector of the colliding quasi - free neutron requires the measurement of the non - interacting residue of the target nucleus ( spectator ) or the decay products of the created meson . in comparison to the @xmath6",
    "_ meson _ reactions , the efficiency for registering the quasi free @xmath7  _ meson _ process is reduced by a large factor and , additionally , the resolution in the four - momentum of the investigated meson also worsens significantly .",
    "therefore , in the evaluation of the data one faces problems of low statistics , which are especially important when the analysis demands subtraction of histograms and when the expected signal is close to the kinematical limit .",
    "such is the situation when the quasi - free @xmath7  _ meson _ reaction is investigated by registering all the outgoing nucleons from the @xmath8 reaction , using the missing mass technique to identify the desired meson events .",
    "the subscript @xmath9 denotes the spectator proton which , it is assumed , does not take part in the reaction and @xmath10 stands for the single meson or multi - meson system .",
    "an identification of the @xmath7  _ meson _ reaction on an event - by - event basis is impossible if only the nucleons are measured .",
    "one can , however , extract the number of registered @xmath7  _ meson _ events from the missing mass distribution provided that the contribution of the continuous spectrum originating from multi - pion production can be subtracted from the signal .    in this article , we describe a method for the subtraction of a physical multi - pion background from the missing mass spectrum for quasi - free @xmath11 reactions , where the decay products of the produced meson are not detected .",
    "such a technique is clearly required in , e.g. , the derivation of the correct number of @xmath12 and @xmath13 events from the missing mass spectra obtained by the cosy-11 collaboration  @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the method in the idealized case where the number of events is infinite .",
    "this simplification will allow us to focus first on the problem of the proximity of the signal to the kinematical limit .",
    "after explaining the main ideas of the background subtraction , we will generalize the discussion to the situation encountered in real experimental conditions .",
    "thus , in section  [ estimation ] we will demonstrate how in the case of the low statistics one can use all events taken at negative excess energies and combine them to construct the shape of the background .",
    "section  [ justification ] will be devoted to the justification of the assumptions made and finally in section  [ example ] we will show an example of the application of the technique to data taken at the cosy-11 facility .    though the method was developed for the analysis of the cosy-11 @xmath14 results , the conclusions are valid also for the production of the @xmath15 and other narrow mesons .",
    "moreover , since the technique is independent of the detection system , it may be also applied when evaluating data obtained at other facilities .",
    "the cosy-11 facility used to investigate the quasi - free @xmath16 reactions is equipped with detectors for the registration of fast charged particles  @xcite , neutrons  @xcite , and slow spectator protons  @xcite .",
    "experiments are conducted using the cosy proton beam  @xcite incident on the internal deuteron cluster target  @xcite .",
    "the total c.m .",
    "energy @xmath17 available for the proton - neutron scattering is fixed by the four - vectors of the incident and spectator protons . due to the internal motion of the nucleons in the deuteron ,",
    "this varies from event to event and in the @xmath18 region a range of about 60  mev is scanned for a fixed beam momentum  @xcite .",
    "the four - momentum vectors of the beam and spectator protons are known for each registered event .",
    "therefore , the collected data can be grouped according to the excess energy with respect to the @xmath4 process .",
    "the production of the @xmath18 meson can only occur if the excess energy @xmath19 , @xmath20 is positive . for negative @xmath19",
    "only pions can be created .",
    "+    fig .",
    "[ missscheme ] shows in a schematic manner the mass distributions expected at three different values of @xmath19 for the unobserved system @xmath10 produced via the @xmath11 reaction .",
    "the upper panel presents an outlined missing mass spectrum when @xmath21 .",
    "the shape of this continuous distribution arises from a convolution of the real invariant mass distribution of the multi - pion system , the efficiency of the detection setup for the simultaneous registration of nucleons from the @xmath22  _ pions _ reaction , and also from the experimental resolution of the missing mass determination . for @xmath23",
    "a signal from the @xmath18 meson is expected on top of the multi - pion mass distribution at a position corresponding to its mass , as shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ missscheme ] . for data at higher @xmath19 the peak from the @xmath18 meson will remain at the same position on the mass axis , though the distribution of multi - pion invariant mass will spread towards larger masses ( lowest panel of fig .",
    "[ missscheme ] ) , extending up to the kinematical limit .",
    "however , in practice , as will be argued later , the change of the multi - pion background can be approximated as a shift of the entire spectrum in the direction of higher masses .    in the case of the @xmath4 reaction measured at the cosy-11 facility",
    ", the experimental mass resolution amounted to about 5  mev(fwhm )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , for measurements at only few mev above the threshold the shape of the pion background must be well known in order to extract the @xmath18 signal .",
    "the lack of a clear indication of the upper end of the signal resulting from the @xmath18 meson production ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ missscheme ] ) constitutes the main problem in disentangling the contributions from the @xmath18 meson and pions .    for simplicity of argumentation ,",
    "let us first assume in subtracting the multi - pion background that the number of registered events is very large , such that one can neglect any statistical fluctuations , and that the shape of the reconstructed invariant mass of the multi - pion background is independent of the excess energy @xmath19 .",
    "the form of the background could then be determined from a missing mass spectrum @xmath24 from an infinitesimal range at any negative values @xmath19 .",
    "having postulated that the shape of the background @xmath25 does not depend on @xmath19 , it is convenient to express it in terms of a normalised function @xmath26 of the difference between the kinematical limit ( @xmath27 ) and the given mass @xmath28 .",
    "being not limited by statistics , one could divide the positive @xmath19 range into very narrow subranges within which the resultant missing mass spectrum would be the simple sum of a signal from the @xmath18 meson and the form @xmath29 multiplied by an appropriate factor .",
    "the discussed situation is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ qmiss ] , where the lower panel shows the method of how to construct the background .",
    "if the two assumptions mentioned above were valid then , in order to derive a signal of the @xmath18 meson from a missing mass spectrum for positive q , it would be sufficient to subtract from this spectrum a missing mass distribution determined for negative @xmath19 after the shift of the latter to the kinematical limit  ( dotted line ) and normalisation at the very low mass values where no events from the @xmath18 meson production are expected  ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "in such a case the contribution of the @xmath4 reaction could be extracted without the necessity of any additional assumption regarding the unknown distribution of the background expressed as a function of the excess energy @xmath30 . in this case",
    "the analysis would not demand an exact knowledge of the dynamics of the background reactions .",
    "due to the finite statistics , one needs to study the missing mass spectrum in finite intervals of @xmath19 .",
    "this does not influence the shape of the missing mass distribution arising from the @xmath31 reaction , though it alters the form of the multi - pion background .",
    "the latter @xmath32 , when derived from the finite @xmath33 range , becomes the convolution of the @xmath29 function and the number of background events expressed as a function of the excess energy @xmath30 . for the range spanned between @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "the missing mass distribution of the background can be expressed as : @xmath36 in the @xmath37 spectrum we can not extract the function @xmath30 in a model - independent way for positive values of @xmath19 ( compare dashed and dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ qmiss]a ) .",
    "we must therefore take as narrow ranges of @xmath38 as reasonable , taking into account the experimental resolution in @xmath19 , and to assume that within such a range the @xmath30 function is constant .",
    "it is natural to take the width of the @xmath19 subranges equal to the fwhm of the resolution of the @xmath19 determination .",
    "such a width choice partially validates the constant @xmath39 assumption , due to the unavoidable experimental smearing within the bin .    by reviewing the experimental distribution @xmath40 shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ mmpisum ] , one recognizes that the obtained statistics are indeed insufficient to derive the @xmath41 spectrum from the bin of @xmath19 with a width equal to the experimental resolution ( i.e.  fwhm  =  5  mev ) .",
    "the statistics could , however , be improved significantly if all events registered with negative @xmath19 could be taken into account .",
    "this can be realized by adding to the missing mass calculated for a given event an amount ( @xmath42 ) , which will shift the background events measured at @xmath43 such as if they were determined at the excess energy of @xmath44 .",
    "the resultant modified missing mass distribution obtained from the entire data sample of negative @xmath19 values can be identified with the function @xmath45 needed for the derivation of the background distribution within a finite excess energy bin centered around the @xmath44 value .",
    "in such a way , when investigating the missing mass spectrum for the @xmath44 bin , one would obtain directly the background spectrum which , after the normalisation , could be subtracted from the distribution containing the signal from the @xmath18 meson .",
    "when the number of events is small , this approach enables one to reduce significantly the statistical fluctuations in the background spectrum .",
    "however , as was already stressed , the entire procedure could only be justified if the shape of the background did not alter within the discussed range of the excess energy @xmath19 . arguments in favour of this assumption will be presented in the subsequent section .",
    "we now present arguments supporting the supposition that the measured shape of the background does not alter significantly with changes in excess energy , at least over the energy range studied .",
    "it is important to stress that this assumption worked correctly when evaluating the data of the reactions @xmath46",
    "@xcite and @xmath47  @xcite and that the derived cross sections are consistent with those obtained at the saturne facility  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the shape of the background spectrum reflects i ) the real distribution of the invariant mass of the multi - pion systems , ii ) the acceptance of the detection setup , and iii ) the experimental resolution .",
    "the acceptance of the detection system , its efficiency and resolution do not change significantly over the considered variation of excess energy . on the level of a few per cent ,",
    "this is true even in the case of the detection setups characterized by a very limited geometrical acceptance , such as e.g.  the cosy-11 facility  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the genuine background distribution is the only significant factor that is relevant to our discussion . in practice , from the high statistics measurements of the @xmath48 reaction , we know that the shape of the background could be sufficiently well described assuming that it was due to two - pion creation only  @xcite .",
    "adding into the simulations three- and four - pion events was superfluous , and did not improve the agreement with the experimental distributions significantly .",
    "+   +   +    fig .",
    "[ monte ] demonstrates the missing mass distribution of @xmath49 system produced via the @xmath11 reaction calculated taking into account experimental resolution of the detection system and various creation scenarios",
    ".     +   +    when @xmath19 increases the distribution of the multi - pion invariant mass broadens towards larger masses . in practice ,",
    "if the change in the value of @xmath19 is small compared to the excess energy with respect to threshold of the @xmath50 reaction , the shape of the mass distribution at its edge remains approximately unaltered .",
    "of interest for us is the range of about 40  mev / c@xmath51 from the higher mass limit .",
    "the events represented by the solid and dotted lines in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ monte ] were simulated at excess energies of q  =  20 and q  =  0  mev with respect to the @xmath52 system . from the comparison of the form of both spectra one",
    "realises that at the edges there is no noticeable difference between the shape of the curves .",
    "thus , this shape , convoluted with an acceptance function independent of the @xmath19 value , will lead to the form of the background which will be a function only of the distance from the kinematical limit , over at least a range of about 40  mev .",
    "the quantitative appraisals of the systematical error caused by the subtraction of the shifted and normalized spectra is depicted in the lower panel of figure  [ monte ] .",
    "this picture demonstrates a fractional systematical error due to the discussed method .",
    "it was calculated as a difference between the mass distributions @xmath53 at q  =  20  mev and q  =  0  mev normalized to the @xmath53(q  =  20  mev ) . from the figure",
    "one can infer that the systematical error in the missing mass range pertinent to our discussion ( close to the kinematical limit ) is in the order of a few per cent of the background value . in the middle and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ monte ] we show the comparison for the production model depicted by the dashed - dotted line in the upper panel , however , we have checked that for other discussed possibilities the determined systematical error is similar .",
    "it is worth noting that in the case of the @xmath15 meson , due to its twice larger mass , the relative changes between dotted and solid lines are even smaller ( see upper panel of fig .",
    "[ monte5 ] ) , and hence the advocated assumption is even better justified .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ monte5 ] indicates that the fractional error due to the changes in the shape is in the order of one per cent only within the range of 200  mev in the vicinity of the kinematical limit .",
    "recently the @xmath18 and @xmath15 mesons production in the proton - neutron collisions has been studied close to the kinematical threshold at the cosy-11 facility  @xcite .",
    "although the evaluation of these data is still in progress , the first trials to distinguish between the multi - pion background and the @xmath18 meson production in the missing mass spectra lead to a clear signal for the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "[ mmexp1]a shows the sum of the missing mass spectra for all @xmath23 bins ( solid line ) and the sum of the corresponding background spectra ( shaded histogram ) .",
    "the data were evaluated as follows .",
    "first the sample of events with excess energy greater than zero was divided into a few intervals of @xmath54 and a missing mass spectrum was calculated for each sub - sample separately .",
    "next , for each of these spectra , determined in interval @xmath33 around a given @xmath44 value , a background was constructed from all events with @xmath19 less than zero .",
    "the missing mass of each background event , measured at given excess energy @xmath43 , was increased by an amount @xmath55 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ mmpisum ] and described in section  [ estimation ] . for each @xmath38 interval separately ,",
    "the background spectrum was normalised to the distribution at a given @xmath44 for mass values less than 0.25  gev / c@xmath51 . in this region",
    "the events correspond to a single pion production , and since the energy is high above the threshold the cross section for @xmath56 production stays nearly constant when the excess energy changes only by few tens of mev .    in order to make a check of the background extraction we have constructed it dividing the range of q values into two parts equal in number of counts .",
    "the comparison of the spectra resulted from the two parts is shown in fig .",
    "[ monte7 ] .",
    "indeed , the determined spectra from different ranges of q are consistent within the statistical errors .",
    "+    fig .",
    "[ mmexp1]b depicts the spectrum of the missing mass for @xmath23 after the background subtraction .",
    "the superimposed line indicates the expectations from the monte - carlo simulations , taking into account the momentum spread of the beam  @xcite , fermi momentum of the nucleons inside the deuteron  @xcite , beam and target dimensions  @xcite , multiple scattering in the detector components and air , and position- , time- and energy- resolution of all detector components  @xcite .",
    "clearly , within the statistical uncertainties , the results of simulations conform very well to the shape of the observed distribution .    for a better visualisation ,",
    "the sums for all @xmath38 intervals are shown in figs .",
    "[ mmexp1]a and  [ mmexp1]b because the individual spectra are statistically much less significant , due to the small number of events in this first measurement , which was meant only as a feasibility test of the cosy-11 facility for the study of the meson production via quasi - free proton - neutron scattering . a more detailed view of the region around the @xmath18 peak is shown in fig .  [ mmexp2]a . for comparison we present also in fig .",
    "[ mmexp2]b the result obtained before the current method was elaborated  @xcite .",
    "this first analysis was done by deriving a missing mass background spectrum from all events with @xmath21 without adding ( event - by - event ) the difference of excess energies between a corresponding background event and that from the bin for which the signal of @xmath18 meson was being studied .",
    "although at first sight both spectra look similar , on closer inspection one recognizes that the left hand histogram agrees statistically much better with the experimentally extracted data than that on the right .",
    "the difference is understandable since the shift of the background to the kinematical limit diminishes the number of background events on the left of the eta - peak and increases that on the right ( see fig .",
    "[ monte9 ] ) , leading to the better agreement with the shape predicted by the monte - carlo studies .",
    "moreover , the total number of events assigned to the @xmath4 reaction , when extracted according to the new procedure , is by about 30% lower than previously estimated  @xcite and now conforms better to the results obtained by the wasa / promice collaboration  @xcite , where photons from the decay of the @xmath18 were detected .     +    finally in fig .  [ monte10 ] we present a @xmath57 function determined for the positive values of q. one can see that the distribution @xmath57 for positive values of q is rather not constant within the @xmath38 bin contrary to the assumption made when constructing the background . therefore , we have made an iterative procedure and construct a background taking in formula  [ equation2 ] the obtained distributuion of @xmath57 .",
    "the result was statistically the same even after the first iteration .",
    "this can be understood since the width of the @xmath38 bin is rather small compared to the mass resolution .",
    "one bin at the mass spectrum ( eg . in figure  [ mmexp2 ] ) corresponds to 4 mev .",
    "therefore , even though the @xmath57 significantly differs from being constant it hardly influences the @xmath58 spectrum within the present statistics . a larger sample of data will enable to determine @xmath57 iteratively more precisely and hence will permit to obtain results not biased by the assumption that @xmath57 is constant within a studied bin .",
    "a technique for disentangling contributions of multi - pion and single meson production in the missing mass spectrum of quasi - free @xmath5 reactions has been presented .",
    "the method enables one to extract a signal for the @xmath7  _ meson _ reactions measured close to the threshold , when the mass resolution is comparable with the centre - of - mass excess energy . in this energy range",
    "the peak in the missing mass spectrum from the single meson creation is close to the kinematical limit and the separation of the signal due to the single meson from that of the continuous distribution associated with multi - pion production becomes nontrivial .",
    "it was also shown how to combine events of different excess energies in order to gain statistical significance in the determination of the shape of the multi - pion mass distribution .    in the case of the @xmath3 reaction measured by the cosy-11 collaboration  @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that the method leads to the derivation of the signal from the quasi - free @xmath4 process that is consistent with expectations .",
    "this successful application , and the fact that the technique is independent of the detection system , suggests that it can be applied more generally for distinguishing between single and multi - meson production in missing mass spectra obtained in @xmath59 reactions .    the presented method will be used for the extraction of the signal from data on @xmath15 meson production via the @xmath60 reaction  @xcite , whose rate is expected to be about forty times lower than that for the @xmath18 meson .",
    "these cross sections are utterly unknown and their determination may be of crucial importance for the study of the gluonic degrees of freedom in the @xmath18 and @xmath15 meson production processes  @xcite .",

    "<S> the method allows one to combine events corresponding to multi - meson production at various excess energies with respect to the @xmath2 process , and hence leads to an increase of the statistics needed for the determination of the shape of the multi - meson background .    as an example of the application of the method </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that the evaluation of the data from the @xmath3 process according to the described technique enables one to extract a signal of the @xmath4 reaction whose shape is consistent with expectations , supporting the correctness and usefulness of the method introduced . </S>"
