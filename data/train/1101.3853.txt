    "recently obtained simulation results@xmath0 regarding single mode rayleigh taylor instability(rti ) problem indicates that the bubble developed at the two fluid interface is accelerated to a velocity quite above the classical model value@xmath1 .",
    "this is ascribed to vorticity formation on the bubble - spike interface that is suggested@xmath0 to diminish the friction drag due to viscosity .",
    "the theoretical calculations and the consequent numerical results regarding rayleigh taylor instability in a viscous fluid@xmath2 also indicates growth of vorticity inside the bubble in the neighbourhood of its tip , where the curvature is maximum .",
    "recent experimental and simulation results@xmath3 show that the influence of viscosity on rti may strongly suppress the growth rate .",
    "it is suggested that high pressure and strain rate conditions give rise to a phonon drag mechanism resulting in the lattice viscosity provided a solid state is maintained@xmath3 .",
    "moreover , it was also suggested by betti and sanz@xmath4 that at the spike , mass ablation induces a transverse component of velocity and thus gives rise to vorticity generation .",
    "it has been shown by the same authors that the instability growth rate is augmented by vorticity accumulation inside the bubble resulting from mass ablation .    as the bubble rises through the denser fluid it encounters viscous resistance .",
    "in this paper we have incorporated the joint effect of viscosity and vorticity .",
    "it is shown how the vorticity induced contribution to bubble velocity as derived by betti and sanz@xmath4 is affected by the viscous drag exerted by the lighter fluid inside the bubble .",
    "it is found that the combined effect of vorticity and viscosity of the bubble fluid tends to diminish the friction drag exerted by the upper heavier fluid as the bubble penetrates through it . in this respect",
    "it is similar to the friction drag reduction effect due to vorticity as suggested by the phenomenological model of ramaprabhu et al.@xmath0 .",

    "taking the difference of eq.(6 ) and eq.(23 ) at the interface of the two fluids and applying the dynamical boundary condition , i.e , the pressure difference at the interface is balanced by the difference of viscous stress and surface tension@xmath70 we obtain the following : @xmath71-\\rho_{l}[-\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial t}+ \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi ) { ^2}-\\omega \\psi + g y]-\\int \\rho_{l}[(\\psi \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial y}-\\frac{\\partial \\dot{\\chi}}{\\partial y})dx + ( \\psi \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial x}+\\frac{\\partial \\dot{\\chi}}{\\partial x})dy]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath72+\\tilde{f}(t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the surface tension and @xmath76 is the radius of curvature at the interface .",

    "are adjusted so that the time dependence has approximate qualitative agrement with simulation results given by fig.4 of ref.@xmath4 .",
    "this may be seen from the graph of @xmath92 plotted against @xmath93 in fig.1 .    in fig.2",
    "are shown the nondimensionalized height ( @xmath98 ) , curvature ( @xmath99 ) and velocity ( @xmath83 ) of the tip of the bubble and plotted against time @xmath100 .",

    "( b ) . the third term @xmath102\\frac{1}{d(\\xi_2,r ) }",
    "$ ] is the contribution from vorticity accumulation inside the bubble@xmath4 causing enhancement of the bubble velocity .",
    "the fourth term @xmath103\\frac{\\xi_{3}}{d(\\xi_2,r)}$ ] accounts for the lowering of the bubble velocity due to viscous drag exerted by the denser fluid .",
    "the last ( fifth ) term @xmath104 gives the vorticity dependent contribution that diminishes the friction drag ; such a possibility was suggested by ramaprabhu et al.@xmath0 .",
    "eq.(26 ) and eq.(27 ) show that as @xmath105 the bubble velocity reaches the following ( nondimensionalized ) asymptotic steady value with @xmath106 ( @xmath107= atwood number ) , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ,    @xmath110    it is be noted that this result agrees with the saturation value of betti and sanz@xmath4 when viscosity is neglected(@xmath111 ) and with that of sung - ik - sohn@xmath70 when vorticity is neglected .    in fig.2 the physical process(a )",
    "is represented by plot i. it is the goncharov ( classical ) model result @xmath112    in absence of viscosity the vorticity aided time development of the bubble velocity is given by plot ii in fig.2 .",
    "this represents the combined effect ( a)+(b ) .",
    "as @xmath92 increases gradually from @xmath113 , plot ii indicates that so does the bubble velocity @xmath63 from the initial value @xmath114 remaining greater than the @xmath115_{classical}$ ] but close to it as long as the vorticity does not increase appreciably .",
    "this continues as @xmath93 increases till @xmath92 builds up sufficiently as indicated in fig.1 with a consequent rapid growth of @xmath63 above the classical saturation value @xmath115_{classical}$ ] as given in plot i of fig.2 .",
    "as @xmath105 the vorticity aided bubble velocity approches the asymptotic value @xmath116    as the bubble rises the viscous resistance of the upper(heavier ) fluid depresses the vorticity aided bubble velocity .",
    "the magnitude of this depression depends on @xmath117 .",
    "this is shown by plot iii in fig.2 representing the cumulative effect ( a)+(b)+(c ) . during the initial stage ,",
    "plot iii is very close to plot i ( @xmath115_{classical}$ ] ) due to vorticity and depressing effect of viscosity .",
    "but as @xmath92 becomes sufficiently large as @xmath93 increases plot iii shoots above plot i and attain the asymptotic value @xmath118    however due to accumulation of vorticity inside the bubble the viscous drag is reduced .",
    "this is indicated by the presence of the term @xmath119 .",
    "the possibility of such an eventuality was suggested by ramaprabhu et .",
    "al.@xmath0 and this is exhibited by the last plot iv in fig.2 representing the cumulative effect ( a)+(b)+(c)+(d ) which lies above plot iii but below plot ii .",
    "thus the following inequalities hold among the asymptotic values : @xmath120 the leftmost inequality shows that the viscous drag exerted by the denser fluid as the bubble penetrates through it is reduced by the viscosity effect on the motion of the lighter fluid due to vorticity accumulation inside the bubble .",
