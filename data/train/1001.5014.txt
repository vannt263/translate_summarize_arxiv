    "the wmap value for @xmath13 is moreover consistent with determinations from supernovae data and baryon acoustic oscillations .",

    "but now a bigger question arises : what is the physical nature of the dark energy ?",
    "different possibilities can be distinguished by their equation of state characterized by @xmath15 .",
    "the equation of state parameter for radiation is simply @xmath16 , whereas for matter , it is @xmath17 .",

    "this is one of the issues addressed by quintessence models and may be probed in observations testing the possibility of variability in fundamental constants .",
    "from the quoted contributions to @xmath0 in matter and baryons from wmap , we can obtain the density of cold dark matter from the difference between the total matter density and the baryon density @xcite _",

    "other dramatic pieces of evidence can be found in combinations of x - ray observations and weak lensing showing the superposition of dark matter ( from lensing ) and ordinary matter from x - ray gas @xcite and from the separation of baryonic and dark matter after the collision of two galaxies as seen in the bullet cluster @xcite . for a more complete discussion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "in addition to being stable ( or at least very long lived ) , the dark matter should be both electrically and color neutral . indeed , there are very strong constraints , forbidding the existence of stable or long lived particles which are not color and electrically neutral as these would become bound with normal matter forming anomalously heavy isotopes .",

    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is stable if r - parity ( @xmath39 ) is unbroken .",
    "there are several possibilities in the mssm , specifically the sneutrino with spin zero , the neutralino with spin 1/2 , and the gravitino with spin 3/2 .",
    "however , a sneutrino lsp would have relatively large coherent interactions with heavy nuclei , and experiments searching directly for the scattering of massive dark matter particles on nuclei exclude a stable sneutrino weighing between a few gev and several tev @xcite .",
    "the possible loophole of a very light sneutrino was excluded by measurements of the invisible @xmath40-boson decay rate at lep @xcite .",
    "the gravitino is a viable candidate and often predicted in models based on supergravity @xcite . in this case , however , its probability for direct detection is negligible .",
    "there are four neutralinos , each of which is a linear combination of the @xmath41 neutral fermions @xcite : the wino @xmath42 , the partner of the 3rd component of the @xmath43 gauge boson ; the bino , @xmath44 ; and the two neutral higgsinos , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the mass and composition of the lsp are determined by the gaugino masses , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the higgs mixing mass term , @xmath49 , and the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values expressed as @xmath50 . in general , neutralinos can be expressed as a linear combination @xmath51    the relic density of neutralinos depends on additional parameters in the mssm beyond @xmath52 , and @xmath50 .",
    "these include the sfermion masses , @xmath53 and the higgs pseudo - scalar mass , @xmath54 . to determine the relic density it is necessary to obtain the general annihilation cross - section for neutralinos . in much of the parameter space of interest ,",
    "the lsp is a bino and the annihilation proceeds mainly through sfermion exchange .    in its generality , the mssm has over 100 undetermined parameters.there are good arguments based on grand unification @xcite and supergravity @xcite which lead to a strong reduction in the number of parameters .",
    "i will assume several unification conditions placed on the supersymmetric parameters . in all models considered , the gaugino masses are assumed to be unified at the gut scale with value , @xmath55 , as are the trilinear couplings with value @xmath56 .",
    "also common to all models considered here is the unification of all soft scalar masses set equal to @xmath57 at the gut scale . with this set of boundary conditions at the gut scale",

    "the former sets the unification scale scalar masses equal to the gravitino mass .",
    "this condition often results in a gravitino lsp @xcite .",
    "the latter condition sets a relation between the supersymmetry breaking bilinear , trilinear and scalar mass terms . because of this condition",
