    "however , recently there has been an explosion of interest in open quantum systems beyond the markovian regime , in which , since the typical assumptions made in deriving gksl master equations are no longer valid , more complex , history - dependent , descriptions of the system dynamics are necessary @xcite .    in particular , the study of non - markovian open quantum systems promises to allow us to better understand the nature of dissipation and decoherence @xcite , thermalisation and equilibration @xcite , non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite and transport phenomena in strongly correlated @xcite and biological systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , within the markovian context , it has been shown that dissipation and decoherence , traditional enemies of quantum information processing , can be exploited as a resource for quantum computation @xcite , the preparation of topological phases @xcite and the preparation of entangled states @xcite . in this sense , it is desirable to understand the extent to which these protocols are robust against relaxation of the strict assumptions involved in this setting .",

    "<S> we present an algorithmic method for the digital quantum simulation of many - body locally - indivisible non - markovian open quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of two parts : firstly , a suzuki - lie - trotter decomposition of the global system propagator into the product of subsystem propagators , which may not be quantum channels , and secondly , an algorithmic procedure for the implementation of the subsystem propagators through unitary operations and measurements on a dilated space . by providing rigorous error bounds for the relevant suzuki - lie - trotter decomposition , we are able to analyse the efficiency of the method , and connect it with an appropriate measure of the local indivisibility of the system . in light of our analysis </S>",
    "<S> , the proposed method is expected to be experimentally achievable for a variety of interesting cases . </S>"
