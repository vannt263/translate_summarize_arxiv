    "it is well - known that the dynamics of spatially periodic harmonic systems is non - ergodic , since it can be completely described as a linear combination ( with time - independent coefficients ) of travelling waves of the form @xmath1 with wave vector @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 .",
    "when there are ( even small ) anharmonic terms present , most harmonic solutions with amplitude zero are very unlikely to be continuable to finite amplitude , because it is generally believed ( despite the famous work of fermi , pasta and ulam @xcite ) that anharmonic terms in general introduce some ergodicity in the system , which in the long term should lead to its thermalization .",
    "it is nevertheless an interesting question to understand whether special harmonic solutions could persist as exact solutions when the system becomes anharmonic .",
    "actually , it has been proven recently that small - amplitude periodic travelling waves ( with the form @xmath4 in the harmonic limit ) do exist for hamiltonian chains of linearly coupled nonlinear oscillators ( _ klein - gordon ( kg ) lattices _ ) @xcite as well as for chains of mass particles with nonlinear nearest - neighbour interactions ( _ fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) lattices _ ) @xcite . however , for kg lattices the unique continuation of harmonic travelling waves is possible only in a regime of weak inter - site coupling ( i.e. , close enough to the so - called _ anticontinuous _",
    "limit @xcite of uncoupled oscillators ) ; beyond this regime , the situation is more complex and there are many bifurcations where new solutions appear ( such as _ nanopterons _ , which are travelling localized waves with a noncancelling periodic tail at infinity ) @xcite . in the simpler regime close to the anticontinuous limit , numerical techniques for finding",
    "time - periodic propagating waves , based on the concept of _ discrete breathers _ ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews of recent developments on discrete breathers ) , were implemented in @xcite .",
    "the solutions were constructed as multi - site breathers ( _multibreathers_ ) from the trivial solution at the anticontinuous limit where all oscillators are oscillating in phase with the same frequency .",
    "an arbitrary spatially uniform phase torsion was then applied , and a newton scheme used to continue these solutions to non - zero coupling according to the theory described in @xcite .    however , as was found already in @xcite from a discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) approximation ( generally valid for small - amplitude oscillations and small coupling , see also sec . 2.2 below ) , propagating waves in kg lattices may exhibit a _ modulational ( benjamin - feir ) instability _ by which an initially uniform wave breaks up into an array of localized pulses . depending on whether the kg on - site potential is soft or hard ( i.e. whether the oscillation frequency decreases or increases with increasing oscillation amplitude for the individual oscillators ) , the modulational instability occurs for either small or large wave vectors of the travelling wave .",
    "( a similar result has been found also for fpu lattices @xcite . )",
    "this instability also appears a consequence of the theory of effective action for multibreathers with phase torsion as developed in @xcite ( see also further developments in @xcite ) .    in this paper , we are interested in the continuation of _ standing waves ( sws ) _ , which in the harmonic limit are superpositions of two travelling waves with the same amplitude and opposite wave vectors , and thus have the form @xmath5 .",
    "we shall here study such solutions for discrete kg systems , and for the related dnls system describing small - amplitude solutions close to the anticontinuous limit .",
    "our approach for finding these solutions is similar to that used in @xcite for disordered kg lattices : we construct appropriate multibreather solutions with frequency outside the linear phonon band at the anticontinuous limit and continue them to nonzero coupling ; these solutions are then continued versus frequency inside the phonon band .",
    "we shall propose an ansatz for finding the appropriate _ coding sequence _",
    "@xcite for these multibreathers , allowing for a smooth continuation of the multibreather versus frequency down to zero amplitude as a linear sw .",
    "when the spatial period of the sw is incommensurate with the lattice period , its envelope ( _ hull _ ) function undergoes a _ transition by breaking of analyticity ( tba ) _",
    "@xcite at some critical value of its frequency .    investigating the linear stability of these nonlinear sws in infinite lattices",
    ", we find the rather striking result that although there exist linearly stable sws close to the anticontinuous limit , all sws with nontrivial wave vectors ( i.e. different from 0 or @xmath6 ) become _ linearly unstable _ through an _ oscillatory instability bifurcation _ when approaching the linear limit .",
    "thus , small - amplitude nonlinear sws will be unstable also for wave numbers where the corresponding propagating waves are modulationally stable .",
    "these extended instabilities are a direct consequence of discreteness , and have not been found within earlier continuum approximations @xcite .",
    "however , similarly as found e.g. in @xcite , the instabilities are very sensitive to finite size effects , so that in a finite system linear stability will generally be recovered close to the linear limit .",
    "moreover , we show that when their hull function is non - analytic , these sws can be viewed as arrays of discommensurations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) of a simple stationary phonon with wave vector @xmath6 or @xmath7 , and that each discommensuration is unstable ( as was found already in @xcite for the dnls model ) .",
    "the effect of the instability on a single discommensuration is analysed with the technique developed in @xcite , and it is found that , after an initial oscillatory regime , it moves spontaneously in the lattice with a rather well - defined velocity , analogously to the behaviour of the discrete dark mode in the dnls model found in @xcite .",
    "the long - time behaviour of the unstable sws can then be interpreted as the result of inelastic interactions between individual moving discommensurations . as for the dnls model the sw with wave vector @xmath0",
    "is found to exactly coincide with the line of phase transition recently discovered @xcite in this model , sws with wave vectors larger or smaller than @xmath0 belong to different phases and therefore yield qualitatively different asymptotic dynamics : one phase corresponds to normal thermalization , while in the other phase persisting large - amplitude localized excitations occur . as we will find from numerical simulations , a similar scenario also occurs for kg chains with small inter - site coupling .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the kg model and derive a dnls - type equation for its small - amplitude dynamics .",
    "this equation generally contains long - range nonlinear interactions , but reduces to the ordinary nearest - neighbour dnls equation in the limit of small coupling . in section 3",
    ", we describe the representation of nonlinear sws as trajectories of a symplectic map , which in the dnls approximation reduces to a cubic map in the 2-dimensional real plane @xcite .",
    "the breakup of kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori for this map corresponds to a tba for the hull function of incommensurate sws , and the continuation of periodic and quasiperiodic map trajectories to the anticontinuous limit yields the sw multibreather coding sequences . in section 4 , we study numerically and analytically the linear stability properties of sws within the dnls approximation , where in particular the existence of oscillatory instabilities close to the linear limit can be proven using perturbation theory . in section 5 , sws in the full kg model are analyzed numerically for two particular examples of soft ( morse ) and hard ( quartic ) on - site potentials .",
    "their linear stability properties are investigated using numerical floquet analysis , and bifurcations determining the limit of existence for larger coupling are identified . in section 6 , we discuss the dynamics resulting from the sw instabilities over short , intermediate , and long time scales , and section 7 concludes the paper .",
    "the more technical parts of the stability analysis for the dnls case is deferred to the appendix .",
    "some of the results obtained in this paper have been presented in an abbreviated form elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional chain of classical anharmonic oscillators ( klein - gordon chain ) ( fig .",
    "[ fig_pot]a ) with hamiltonian    @xmath8 \\equiv \\sum_{n=1}^n h_n ,            \\label{hamilt1}\\ ] ]    where the total energy attributed to each site @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 the oscillators are submitted to a nonlinear on - site potential @xmath11 and are coupled by a harmonic inter - site coupling @xmath12 .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=321 ]    thus , within the dnls approximation and assuming a soft potential ( @xmath83 ) , we should expect for large systems to always observe an equipartitioned asymptotic state for all initially slightly perturbed unstable type @xmath250 sws with @xmath255 , while persistent breathers should be created from sws with @xmath567 ( with the opposite conclusion for hard potentials ) .",
    "we confirmed this by numerical simulations , although for @xmath2 close to but smaller than @xmath0 the system size @xmath269 needs to be rather large to allow breather formation .",
    "moreover , we confirmed numerically that also for the original kg lattices there appears to be a phase transition at @xmath577 between a thermalized phase and a breather phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig_formation ] ) .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the results derived in @xcite depend crucially on the existence of a second conserved quantity , and it is therefore questionable whether such a transition strictly speaking occurs also in other models , or if the breather phase observed here for kg models only describes the dynamics over a long but finite time range , while asymptotically thermalization will occur also there . in any case , over the time scales that we have been able to follow numerically we have seen no signs of breather decay , and thus it is clear that the phase transition obtained in the dnls approximation is of large relevance also for the long - time dynamics in the kg models .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that for a general class of anharmonic lattices , different types of sws with spatial period commensurate or incommensurate with the lattice exist , but are generically unstable through oscillatory instabilities for small amplitudes .",
    "thus , in discrete systems , the nonlinearity - induced coupling between counter - propagating waves leads to wave break - down for arbitrarily weak anharmonicity _ even if the individual propagating waves are modulationally stable_. the physical mechanisms of the oscillatory instabilities can be related to a two - component structure of the sws , which however is of different nature close to the anticontinuous and to the linear limits , respectively . in the first case ,",
    "the natural interpretation is in terms of the multibreather description ( [ code])-([hull ] ) of the sw , with ( quasi-)periodically repeated sites of large ( code @xmath566 ) and small ( code @xmath7 ) amplitude , which defines a two - sublattice structure .",
    "then , for small inter - site coupling the eigenmodes of the linearized equations describing the small - amplitude oscillations around the exact sw are mainly localized on one of these two sublattices , and the instabilities appear when , as the coupling is increased , eigenfrequencies belonging to the different sublattices start to coincide . on the other hand ,",
    "close to the linear limit , the oscillatory instabilities arise from overlap between positive- and negative - frequency plane - wave solutions to the linearized equations ( [ eigeneqns ] ) in the dnls - approximation , which are coupled by the sw amplitude @xmath369 . ) vanishes as @xmath598 ) . ]",
    "it is instructive to point out some aspects where the stability analysis of sws considerably differs from that of propagating waves .",
    "firstly , for propagating waves there is no two - component structure at the anticontinuous limit , as their amplitude is homogeneous with all sites having codes @xmath294 @xcite .",
    "secondly , propagating waves are non - time - reversible with a complex amplitude @xmath599 in the dnls approximation , which modifies the eigenvalue problems ( [ eigeneqns])-([eigen_prob ] ) @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the spatial fourier expansion ( [ psi_esp ] ) of a propagating wave in the dnls approximation trivially contains only one term ( @xmath421 ) , so that instabilities resulting from higher - order resonances ( which are the only instabilities appearing for analytic incommensurate dnls sws close to the linear limit ) are excluded .    we should also stress that in general , there is no direct relation between the frequency of the sw and the frequencies of the oscillatory instabilities , as the instabilities are related to resonances between two different classes of solutions to the linearized equations ( with opposite krein signature ) , and not to the sw frequency itself . also , as the instabilities for the infinite chain result from overlap between continuous bands and not isolated eigenvalues , the wavelengths of the unstable modes generally belong to a broad spectrum",
    "however , for commensurate waves close to the linear limit , we proved in the appendix that the first - order ( strongest ) instabilities correspond to frequencies and wavelengths close to , but different from , those of the sw itself ( @xmath600 , cf .",
    "( [ coninst ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , we showed by perturbation theory that the strength of the oscillatory instability ( i.e. , its growth rate ) close to the linear limit is proportional to the corresponding spatial fourier component @xmath447 of its squared dnls amplitude @xmath369 , and thus initially increases with the amplitude .",
    "the instability persists until , in the highly nonlinear regime , the frequencies of the two subclasses of linearized modes become out of resonance ( through an inverse krein bifurcation ) , so that close to the uncoupled limit the instability is suppressed ( cf . the similar scenario for the discrete dark soliton corresponding to @xmath254 in @xcite ) .    obviously , this paper has been mainly concerned with fundamental properties of the sws and their instabilities in generic but simple models , and more work needs to be done in order to elucidate their role in real physical systems , e.g. , whether they have some influence on thermal transport coefficients .",
    "however , one result obtained here ( sec .  [ sec_dyn ] ) that should be emphasized in this context is , that the partition of the phase space for the asymptotic dynamics of the dnls model ( due to the norm conservation ) in two regimes found in ref .",
    "@xcite , corresponding respectively to a gibbsian thermal equilibrium and formation of persisting breathers , is given a clear physical interpretation in terms of the sws : the transition line ( [ phase ] ) is defined by a ( type @xmath250 ) sw with wave vector @xmath577 , and sws with given @xmath2 always belong to the same regime regardless of their amplitude .",
    "more work should be done in order to elucidate the relevance of this transition for the kg system , e.g. , to see if the partition of the phase space is fully broken in the absence of norm conservation , and to determine typical lifetimes of special configurations like breathers and sws . in this context , we also want to draw the attention to the very recent ref .",
    "@xcite , where the processes of breather formation , coalescence and evolution to energy equipartition were analyzed for the fpu chain .",
    "there , it was found that exciting initially a single linear mode , the initial state first relaxes to an anharmonic spatially periodic solution , which we interpret as the fpu counterpart of our sws .",
    "later , this solution breaks up and the periodicity is lost , which we believe is related to instabilities similar to those obtained in our work .",
    "thus , the sws and their instabilities apparently provide an important link in the understanding of the pathway to energy localization and equipartition in anharmonic lattices .",
    "concerning possible experimental observation , the general nature of our results suggests that these instabilities should be observable in macroscopic as well as microscopic contexts . in particular , as was recently experimentally verified @xcite , nonlinear optical waveguide arrays provide a direct application of the dnls equation , and thus these systems are also good candidates for detection of sw instabilities .",

    "<S> we consider existence and stability properties of nonlinear spatially periodic or quasiperiodic standing waves ( sws ) in one - dimensional lattices of coupled anharmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we consider klein - gordon ( kg ) chains with either soft ( e.g. , morse ) or hard ( e.g. , quartic ) on - site potentials , as well as discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) chains approximating the small - amplitude dynamics of kg chains with weak inter - site coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the sws are constructed as exact time - periodic multibreather solutions from the anticontinuous limit of uncoupled oscillators . in the validity regime of the dnls approximation </S>",
    "<S> these solutions can be continued into the linear phonon band , where they merge into standard harmonic sws . </S>",
    "<S> for sws with incommensurate wave vectors , this continuation is associated with an inverse transition by breaking of analyticity . </S>",
    "<S> when the dnls approximation is not valid , the continuation may be interrupted by bifurcations associated with resonances with higher harmonics of the sw . concerning the stability , we identify one class of sws which are always linearly stable close to the anticontinuous limit . however , approaching the linear limit all sws with nontrivial wave vectors become unstable through oscillatory instabilities , persisting for arbitrarily small amplitudes in infinite lattices . investigating the dynamics resulting from these instabilities , we find two qualitatively different regimes for wave vectors smaller than or larger than @xmath0 , respectively . in one regime </S>",
