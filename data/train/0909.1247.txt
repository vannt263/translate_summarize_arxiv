    "however , it was then shown in  @xcite by means of an example that invariants of the algebraic concordance group , such as the signature functions , are insufficient to prove the independence of algebraic knots .",
    "somewhat later , miyazaki  @xcite showed that the particular example in  @xcite was not _ ribbon _ , and",

    "plumbing_. here we develop tools based on casson - gordon theory  @xcite to prove the independence of a large family of algebraic knots , a family which includes the particular example first found in  @xcite .    to be more specific , let @xmath0 denote the group of ( topologically locally flat ) concordance classes of knots in @xmath1 , and let @xmath2 denote the algebraic concordance group . in  @xcite ,",
    "levine constructed a surjection @xmath3 whose counterpart in higher dimensions is an isomorphism .",
    "the main result of this article is the following .    * theorem 1 . *",
    "_ let @xmath4 denote the subgroup of the knot concordance group @xmath0 generated by algebraic knots : connected links of isolated singularities in @xmath5 .",
    "then the intersection of @xmath4 with the kernel of @xmath6 contains an infinitely generated free abelian subgroup .",

    "thus @xmath10 represents @xmath8 times the generator of the first homology of the tubular neighborhood of @xmath7 . in the special case that @xmath7 is the unknot @xmath12 , so that @xmath10 is a torus knot , we use the standard notation of @xmath13 rather than @xmath14 .",
    "the notation can be iterated ; for instance , @xmath15 denotes the @xmath16cable of the @xmath11cable of @xmath7 .",
    "an _ algebraic knot _ is , by definition , the connected link of an isolated singularity of a polynomial map @xmath17 .",

    "a novel feature of our approach is the essential interplay between signature and discriminant invariants on the witt group of hermitian forms over @xmath27 .",
    "casson - gordon signature invariants , which are @xmath28valued and hence more effective in identifying elements of infinite order , are often intractable to compute .",
    "discriminant invariants are computable algorithmically  @xcite , but because they take values in a group that is @xmath29torsion , they are less effective in determining linear independence . by combining the two types of invariants we are able to apply the power of signatures while bypassing the need to explicitly compute their values ; we can also avoid most of the typically messy work of analyzing metabolizers which plagues many discriminant arguments used to show that certain knots have infinite order in @xmath0 .",

    "knots which represent the zero element in @xmath0 are called _",
    "slice_.    from this point forward",
    "we do not distinguish in our notation between a knot and its concordance class .",

    "an early result of seifert  @xcite ( see  ( * ? ? ? * theorem 6.15 ) for a recent reference ) states that the alexander polynomial of a satellite knot is determined by the alexander polynomials of the knots involved in the construction , together with an integer called the winding number . in the case of cables ,",
    "the formula is given by @xmath43 for a connected sum , the alexander polynomial is simply the product of the alexander polynomials of the constituent knots .",

    "tristram signatures of a knot  @xcite , which define integer - valued homomorphisms on @xmath0 , can be used to further show that algebraic knots have infinite order in @xmath0 .",
    "these observations might lead one to conjecture that the set of algebraic knots forms a basis for an infinitely generated free abelian subgroup @xmath44 . a first line of attack to this question , as taken in  @xcite and  @xcite , is to consider the _ algebraic concordance group _ @xmath2 and to determine the image of the composite @xmath45 .",

    ", this formula implies that the knot in theorem 2 , @xmath48 , is algebraically slice .",
    "it represents the simplest example of a knot in the kernel of the composite @xmath45 . showing this knot is not slice has remained open until now , although miyazaki proved it is not ribbon  @xcite .",
    "the reader will have noticed that the term `` algebraic '' has two different meanings in this paper ; on the one hand it describes a class of knots defined as links of isolated singularities , and on the other it describes a certain quotient of the knot concordance group .",
    "algebraic knots are iterated cables , and we will typically work with general cables , so this should cause no confusion .",
    "progress in identifying the structure of algebraic knots in the setting of smooth concordance has been achieved largely through analytic means or the deep combinatorial approach stemming from khovanov homology theory .",
    "this is most notable in the solutions to the milnor conjecture and the proof that the smooth 4ball genus of a torus knot is realized by an algebraic curve  @xcite .",
    "highlighting the necessity of smooth techniques in studying algebraic knots , rudolph  @xcite observed that the milnor conjecture is false in the topological locally flat category .",
    "thus , it comes as a surprise that casson - gordon methods apply so effectively in the present setting , having the further advantage that we can establish the independence of these knots in the topological concordance group .",
    "nonetheless , it would be interesting to know the extent to which the array of existing smooth concordance invariants can be used to address the question of independence of algebraic knots .",
    "we should point out , however , that the ozsvth - szab  @xcite and rasmussen  @xcite concordance invariants , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , coming from knot floer homology and khovanov homology , respectively , contain no information for the knots at hand .",
    "we make this precise in proposition [ prop : stau ] , which shows that both invariants vanish for the family above and its obvious generalization to positively iterated torus knots .    despite the failure of @xmath50 and @xmath49",
    ", it seems likely that grading information from the floer homology of branched covers ( in the form of the fryshov invariant  @xcite , ozsvth - szab correction terms  @xcite , or chern - simons invariant of @xmath51 representations  @xcite ) could be useful in our pursuit .",
    "however , extensive computations of such invariants in the first two cases is difficult , and computing chern - simons invariants of covers in the spirit of fintushel - stern  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) and furuta  ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1 ) have failed to determine if any member of the family of knots in the present article are slice .",
    "* acknowledgment : * conversations with tom mrowka about the ribbon - slice conjecture led naturally to the investigations of this paper .",
    "the relationship between this ribbon - slice problem and the concordance independence of algebraic knots is discussed in the second appendix .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we write @xmath10 for the @xmath11cable of @xmath7 and @xmath36 for @xmath52 , which , by a simple orientation argument , equals @xmath38 . cabling",
    "the concordance shows that the concordance class of @xmath10 depends only on the concordance class of @xmath7 , in the sense that if @xmath7 and @xmath53 are concordant , then @xmath10 and @xmath54 are concordant .",
    "these observations , along with our earlier description of the blanchfield pairing of a cable knot , yields the following general statement , implicit in  @xcite .",

    "while the problem of concordance relations between algebraic knots grew out of , and has obvious interest within , the classical theory of plane curve singularities , it could potentially be more important to the old question of whether slice knots are ribbon .",
    "indeed , these connections were the original motivation for the work at hand , as we now briefly explain .",
    "first , recall that a knot is _ ribbon _ if it bounds a _ ribbon disk _ in the four - dimensional unit ball .",
    "a ribbon disk is a smoothly , properly , embedded disk on which the radial function for the four - ball restricts to a morse function with no index @xmath339 critical points ; that is , a disk for which the radial function has no local maxima .",
    "the ribbon - slice problem asks whether all slice knots bound a ribbon disk ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the fact that it is longstanding , this question is important because the property of being ribbon has an entirely three - dimensional interpretation .",
    "( the interpretation is in terms of immersed disks in the three - sphere with certain types of double points , of so - called ribbon type . )",
    "an affirmative answer would indicate that the elusive four - dimensional nature of the smooth concordance group could be understood by three - dimensional techniques .",
    "an interesting but elementary observation which first appeared in  @xcite is that a geometrically minimal disk , that is , a disk whose mean curvature vector vanishes identically , is a ribbon disk .",
    "this follows from the well - known fact that the coordinate functions on @xmath591 restrict to harmonic functions on a minimal disk . from this",
    "it follows easily that the radial function restricts to a sub - harmonic function , and hence it has no local maxima .    in light of this , one is naturally led to wonder whether slice knots bound minimal disks in the four - ball .",
    "this is the realm of the classical plateau problem which asks , more and less generally , when a given curve in @xmath592 arises as the boundary of an area - minimizing map @xmath593 . in this form , the answer is  always , \" as proved by douglas and rad independently in the early 1930 s  @xcite .",
    "the astute reader should be confused , since this seems to imply that not only is every slice knot ribbon , but _ every _ knot is ribbon .",
    "the point of confusion lies in the precise nature of the douglas - rad solution .",
    "they showed that any rectifiable curve in @xmath592 ( in particular , every knot in @xmath594 ) arises as the boundary of a map @xmath593 which is absolutely area - minimizing , and hence geometrically minimal , but may have two types of singularities .",
    "the first type are self - intersections ; that is , the map is at best an immersion . the second type of singularity , called _ branch points _ , are the image of points @xmath595 at which the derivative vanishes : @xmath596 .",
    "it is this latter type of singularity which ties the ribbon - slice problem to the concordance problem of algebraic knots .",
    "the key point is that the structure of branch points of minimal surfaces in @xmath591 can be understood in terms very similar to those in the classical theory of plane curve singularities .",
    "indeed , micallef and white  @xcite showed that the link of a branch point of an area - minimizing map @xmath597 is equivalent , up to a possibly orientation - reversing diffeomorphism of @xmath598 , to an algebraic link .",
    "thus the boundary of a small neighborhood of the pre - image of a branch point , @xmath599 , is mapped into the three - sphere @xmath600 as the link type of an algebraic link or its mirror image .",
    "( here @xmath601 is a neighborhood in @xmath591 of the branch point . )    in the case of a topologically embedded minimal disk we can group any branch points together to obtain a ribbon concordance ( that is , a ribbon cylinder ) between the boundary of the disk and a connected sum of knots , @xmath602 , where each @xmath603 is either an algebraic knot or the mirror image of an algebraic knot . if we could show that the only such sums which are slice are of the form @xmath604 , then we could replace the neighborhood of the collection of branch points in the minimal disk with the obvious ribbon disk bounded by such connected sums .",
    "this replacement results in a ribbon disk for the original knot .      1 .",
    "show that any slice knot type can be realized as the boundary of a topologically embedded minimal disk , but possibly with branch points .",
    "classify concordance relations between algebraic links and show that the only such relations are of the form @xmath604 .",
    "note that if any other relations exist , they can not be realized by ribbon disks , by miyazaki  @xcite . in this case",
    "the answer to the ribbon - slice question would be in the negative .",
    "the first step seems more difficult due to the nature of known results for plateau - type problems , which indicate that self - intersections of minimal maps are more likely to occur generically than branch points .",
    "hence it may be too much to hope that one can find the required minimal embeddings through the current techniques .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that hass  @xcite showed that any ribbon knot has an isotopy representative bounding an embedded minimal disk without branch points .",
    "thus if the answer to the ribbon - slice question is affirmative , then the strategy works without the second step .",
    "it is our hope , however , that importing the concordance result could provide useful flexibility in the geometric approach to the problem .",
