    "it is well known that selective resummations can play an important role in quantum field theory .",
    "a prominent example is the hard thermal loop theory , which includes screening effects that regulate infra - red divergences .",
    "the convergence of such perturbation theories can typically be improved using an @xmath0-particle irreducible ( @xmath0pi ) effective action .",
    "in addition , @xmath0pi approximation schemes can be used to study far from equilibrium systems .",
    "although the @xmath0pi effective action is consistent with the global symmetries of the theory , symmetry identities for @xmath0-point functions may not be satisfied during intermediate steps of the calculation @xcite . for scalar theories , goldstone s theorem may not be satisfied , and for gauge theories , ward identities can be violated . to address this problem we look at the resummed @xmath0pi effective action , which is defined with respect to the self consistent solutions of the @xmath0-point functions .",
    "this type of strategy was originally proposed by baym and kadanoff @xcite .",
    "the resummed effective action respects all symmetry properties of the theory , and the @xmath0-point functions which are obtained by functional differentiation satisfy goldstone s theorem , or the ward identities .",
    "transport coefficients can be calculated from the kubo formulae .",
    "conductivity and shear viscosity are obtained from the zero frequency limit of the 2-point function .",
    "this limit produces pinch singularities , which come from pairs of retarded and advanced propagators which carry the same momenta .",
    "when integrating a term of the form @xmath1 , the integration contour is ` pinched ' between poles on each side of the real axis , and the integral contains a divergence called a ` pinch singularity . '",
    "these divergences are regulated by using resummed propagators which account for the finite width of thermal excitations .",
    "this procedure introduces extra factors of the coupling in the denominators which change the power counting . as a consequence , in even the leading order ( lo )",
    "calculation , there is an infinite set of graphs which contain products of pinching pairs that need to be resummed .",
    "this is accomplished by solving an integral equation whose kernel is the square of the matrix elements that correspond to the 2 @xmath2 2 scattering and production processes . in gauge theories , in addition to pinch singularities , the presence of collinear singularities makes 2 @xmath2 3 scatterings as important as 2 @xmath2 2 scatterings .",
    "these collinear terms are resummed by another integral equation .",
    "the complete lo result is obtained by solving the two coupled integral equations .",
    "the integral equations that resum pinch and collinear singularities can be obtained from the equations of motion ( eom s ) of the 3-loop 3pi effective action @xcite .",
    "gauge invariance is automatically satisfied , and all lo terms appear without the need for any kind of power counting arguments .",
    "little progress has been made on the calculation of transport coefficients beyond lo ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "since power counting is notoriously difficult , and becomes increasingly complicated at higher orders , @xmath0pi effective theories could provide a useful method to organise the calculation of transport coefficients at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .    in spite of the complexity of the @xmath0pi effective action , a systematic expansion can be done in a self - consistent way @xcite . using the 4-loop 4pi effective action for a scalar theory with cubic and quartic interactions , with non - vanishing field expectation value",

    "a given graph in the effective action will produce contributions to the eom s of each vertex it contains . in order to produce the correct symmetry factor when joining legs , we must drop the corresponding contribution in all but one eom , which we can take to be the eom for the largest vertex present .",
    "this is accomplished by imposing the condition @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "if the largest vertex appears in a given diagram in the effective action more than once , the graph that is produced by joining the legs will have a symmetry factor that is too large by a factor equal to the number of times the vertex appears .",
