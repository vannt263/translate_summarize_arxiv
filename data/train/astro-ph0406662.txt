    "in the last year significant advances have been made in understanding the characteristics of the redshifted 21 cm emission from the epoch of reionization , and how this signal can be separated from the contaminating foreground emission .",
    "it was originally believed that contamination from a host of strong foreground sources would overwhelm the eor signal @xcite , making observations all but impossible . in the fall of 2003",
    "it was shown by @xcite and @xcite that differences in the frequency characteristics between the foreground contamination and the eor emission could be used to identify the cosmological signal .",
    "additionally , these papers show how statistical techniques developed for measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) could be extended to eor observations .",
    "recent theoretical advances by @xcite have demonstrated that these statistical eor observations can easily differentiate between various reionization histories .",
    "the combination of new analysis methods , accurate theoretical calculations , and advances in low frequency radio instrumentation have spawned several experimental eor efforts .",
    "one remaining stumbling block for instrumental designers is the difficulty in predicting the sensitivity of a radio array to the eor power spectrum . in section [ sensitivityderivation ]",
    "we generalize the sensitivity calculations to accurately include both frequency information and the effects of antenna distribution",
    ". sections [ scalingrelationships ] and [ configurationsec ] then explore the effects of design choices on the eor sensitivity , and the implications for eor arrays .",
    "it is important to note that residual errors from subtracting foreground sources will contaminate the power spectrum .",
    "the sensitivity calculation presented here only includes the effects of the thermal noise , and thus represents an upper limit on the signal - to - noise ratio which can be obtained by a given array .",
    "however , determining the noise - dominated sensitivity is still important for designing eor observatories .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the eor produces a spherically symmetric three dimensional power spectrum signal .",
    "this introduces a notational difficulty since most of the theoretical work for the cmb uses spherical harmonics . because the cosmic microwave background signal forms a spherical two dimensional surface on the sky , spherical harmonics are the natural orthogonal set .",
    "the @xmath0 terms of the spherical harmonics can be summed over because the isotropy of space removes the rotational dependence , leaving the standard multipole @xmath1 expansion of the cmb .",
    "this formalism has trouble with the eor signal , however , because the observed frequency of the redshifted 21 cm emission maps to the line - of - sight distance , and introduces a third dimension to the data set .",
    "one approach is to use a separate spherical harmonic expansion for each `` step '' in the line - of - sight distance , producing a series of shells ( see @xcite ) . in this representation",
    "the signal in neighboring frequency slices is highly correlated due to the large amount of low frequency power in the matter density power spectrum .",
    "this correlation between shells makes calculating the the sensitivity of multi - frequency observations with the spherical harmonic formalism very difficult .",
    "the solution is to choose a basis set that extracts the spatial structure of the signal in all three dimensions , minimizing the correlation of the parameters .",
    "while there are several basis sets which could be used , we follow the approach of @xcite and use the three dimensional fourier transform representation .",
    "if spherical sky effects can be ignored , the true signal is uncorrelated in this representation with the only correlation being introduced by the field of view and bandwidth of the observations .",
    "because the quantities are largely independent in this basis , calculating the sensitivity of an array is much simpler .",
    "the relationships between the image cube , the measured visibility cube , and the fourier representation are depicted in figure [ cubetransform ] .",
    "the following derivation is based on the visibility calculation developed by @xcite for cmb interferrometers , generalized to three dimensional fourier coordinates .",
    "this approach accounts for the true antenna distribution of the array and the effects of earth rotation when calculating sensitivity of a radio interferometer to the eor signal , but neglects the effects of foreground contamination .",
    "section [ signalsec ] briefly reviews the derivation of the eor signal power spectrum , and section [ noisesec ] derives the characteristics of the thermal noise and explains how to precisely calculate the power spectrum sensitivity .",
    "these relationships are then approximated in sections [ scalingrelationships ] and [ configurationsec ] to explore the effects of array design on the sensitivity .",
    "the true distribution of neutral hydrogen emission is given by @xmath2 the vector @xmath3 describes the position in the three dimensional fourier space and is defined by @xmath4 .",
    "the variables @xmath5 in turn are the wave numbers associated with the spatial positions on the sky @xmath6 and the frequency @xmath7 , as described in figure [ cubetransform ] .",
    "( note that this three dimensional definition of @xmath3 is not equal to the two dimensional version used in spherical harmonic cmb derivations . )",
    "the contributions to the neutral hydrogen emission @xmath8 can be separated into a spin temperature component @xmath9 , and a density and ionization fraction term @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the density of hydrogen and neutral hydrogen respectively , and @xmath13 denotes the average . for a baryon density @xmath14 and a helium fraction @xmath15 , @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 in brightness temperature units .",
    "a full derivation of @xmath16 along with definitions of all terms is given in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the theoretical expectation for the cross - correlation of the true sky emission is a delta function given by @xmath18 however , correlations are introduced by the finite field of view and bandwidth of the experiment .",
    "the correlation between two measured @xmath19 values ( no subscript @xmath20 for measured value ) is then given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the window function given by the field of view and bandwidth of the array and @xmath23 and is spherically symmetric due to the isotropy of space ( see @xcite for a full derivation ) .",
    "equation [ csignal ] captures the essential characteristics of the signal .",
    "the correlation between separate measurements is entirely determined by the field of view and bandwidth of the measurement , and falls rapidly as the measurements move apart in the @xmath3 space . as the field of view and bandwidth increase @xmath24 becomes more centrally condensed , reducing the correlation length between measurements and increasing the expectation value of @xmath25 .",

    "there are two polarizations and @xmath28 is reduced by @xmath29 from that of a single dipole .",
    "alternatively , @xmath28 can be defined as the system temperature of a single polarization , and number of independent visibility points in equation [ cnoiseavg1 ] can be increased by the number of polarizations .",

    "moving to the fourier representation , the total noise for every measurement @xmath35 can be calculated by fourier transforming the visibilities .",
    "( the superscript @xmath36 indicates noise and superscript @xmath37 signal . ) since the noise contributions to the visibilities are gaussian distributed with zero mean , @xmath35 will also be gaussian distributed with zero mean .",
    "since the rms of @xmath35 is constant for all @xmath3 it can be easily calculated from the @xmath38 term and the average visibility rms    [ ] @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the total bandwidth of the measurement .",
    "the rms of the sum is @xmath41 times the average rms of @xmath26 times @xmath33 , and",
    "is given by @xmath42 it is convenient to rewrite the effective area and bandwidth in terms of the physical size of the antenna @xmath43 ( m@xmath32 ) and the inverse of the bandwidth range @xmath44 ( hz@xmath45 ) @xmath46 in physical terms , @xmath47 represents the approximate dimensions of the area averaged by the correlator in the fourier space , with the efficiency @xmath48 representing the collecting efficiency of the array both spatially within an antenna and in frequency .    to compare with the correlation matrix of the signal",
    "@xmath25 we need to determine the correlation matrix of the noise    [ cnoisecorra ] @xmath49    because the thermal noise is random , @xmath50 is gaussian distributed with zero mean and rms @xmath51 given by equation [ inoise ] .",
    "the expected distribution of @xmath52 is rayleigh distributed and @xmath53 is exponentially distributed with rms @xmath54^{2}$ ] .",

    "instead of using @xmath56 and @xmath57 to label the observed baselines , equivalently the fourier space can be divided into a large number of cells with @xmath56 and @xmath57 labeling the cells ( also applies to equations [ csignal ] and [ cnoisecorra ] ) .",
    "the noise in an analysis cell is then given by @xmath58_{\\rm rms}= 2\\left ( \\frac { 2 k_{b}t_{sys}}{\\epsilon\\ , da\\,d\\eta}\\right ) ^{2}\\frac{1}{b\\,\\bar{n}(\\mathbf{u})\\,t}\\delta_{ij},\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the time average number of baselines in an observing cell and @xmath60 is the total observation duration .",
    "for many realistic arrays @xmath59 may range from greater than one at short distances due to redundant baselines to much less than one on longer baselines .",
    "the effects of array configuration on the power spectrum sensitivity are explored in section [ configurationsec ] .    in principle , equations [ csignal ] , [ cnoisecorr ] and [ cnoiseu ] contain all the information required to calculate the sensitivity of any given array and observing program .",
    "using a simulation of the detector array and observing strategy , the observed fourier space can be divided into many small cells , with the signal strength and correlation for the cells given by equation [ csignal ] and the uncertainty in each cell due to thermal noise given by equation [ cnoiseu ] .",

    "this allows the layout of the array and the observing strategy to be accurately included in the sensitivity calculation .",

    ".    equation [ cnoiseavg1 ] be used to directly calculate a close approximation of the sensitivity as a function of wave number ( one dimensional ) .",
    "while equations [ csignal ] , [ cnoisecorr ] , [ cnoiseu ] and [ cnoiseavg1 ] allow calculation of the power spectrum sensitivity , the implications for array design are not immediately obvious . in the next two sections we explore the scaling behavior of these equations and the implications for array design .",
    "looking closely at equation [ csignal ] for the signal properties reveals two important characteristics .",
    "first , the correlation length is inversely proportional to the field of view and bandwidth of the observation . for many interferometric arrays at low radio frequencies , the incident electric field",
    "is directly sampled by simple dipole or similar detector elements . because digitization and correlation is still relatively expensive compared to the cost of a single detection element , it is common to use a beamformer to combine the data from a small group of elements into one `` antenna . ''",
    "the field of view of an observatory is roughly equal to the inverse of the physical extent of the beamformed antennas , and we identify @xmath43 in our derivation as the area of one beamformed region .",
    "thus as the size of the antennas shrinks , the field of view expands , allowing a larger portion of the sky to be simultaneously observed and reducing the correlation length of the power spectrum .",
    "we can use this to go a step farther and choose @xmath47 as the cell size for the analysis .",
    "all measurements which fall within one cell will then be highly correlated and measurements in all other cells will be largely independent .",
    "we can then make the approximation that @xmath69 since the window function @xmath70 is sharply peaked , the magnitude of the signal @xmath25 is proportional to the integral of @xmath71 . by parseval",
    "s relation this gives @xmath72    rewriting equation [ cnoiseavg1 ] with the cell size @xmath47 gives us the uncertainty due to thermal noise in our measurement of the eor power spectrum within an annular shell of width @xmath67 @xmath73_{\\rm rms } \\approx 2\\sqrt{\\frac{da\\,d\\eta}{2\\pi |\\mathbf{u}|^{2}du}}\\left ( \\frac { 2 k_{b}t_{sys}}{\\epsilon\\ , da\\,d\\eta}\\right ) ^{2}\\frac{1}{b\\,\\bar{n}(|\\mathbf{u}|)\\,t}.\\ ] ] in the limit that the noise uncertainty dominates the `` cosmic variance '' uncertainty introduced by the finite number of measurements ( s / n @xmath74 for each cell ) , we can divide the expected signal by the rms in an spherical annulus to determine the approximate signal to noise ratio for the eor power spectrum .",
    "we can then vary equations [ csignalscaling ] and [ cnoiseavg2 ] with respect to different parameters to get the scaling relationships shown in table [ scalingtable ] . as the thermal noise becomes small these scaling laws",
    "must be modified , but they hold over the range of sensitivities expected for next generation radio arrays .",
    "table [ scalingtable ] can help guide experimentalists on how design choices affect the sensitivity of an array to the eor power spectrum .",

    "n & @xmath86 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 fov & @xmath78 & @xmath89 & @xmath60 [ scalingtable ]    one of the unusual properties of the power spectrum measurement is that it is fundamentally the square of an intensity , so the uncertainty of the power spectrum decreases as the square of the uncertainty in the individual measurements .",
    "this leads to surprising effects , such as the uncertainty being inversely proportional to the integration time @xmath60 instead of @xmath90a well known if seldom publicized effect from cmb experiements .",
    "however , not all scaling relations are squared .",
    "certain parameters such as the bandwidth do not decrease the uncertainty of an individual power measurement but instead add independent power measurements , and the sensitivity scales with the square root of the number of measurements . to help work through all of the various combinations in the table",
    ", the following list explains the behavior observed in each column of the table .    * * adding antennas @xmath91 . * adding collecting area by adding more antennas of the same size ( @xmath43 held constant ) decreases the uncertainty in the power spectrum measurement as @xmath81 .",
    "this dependence comes entirely through the average number of measurements per cell @xmath92 .",
    "because the size of the antennas is constant the cell size remains the same while the number of visibilities increases as the square of the number of antennas , increasing @xmath93 .",
    "of course the correlation load also increases proportional to @xmath86 , which can be a significant expense . * * increasing antenna size @xmath94 . *",
    "another alternative for adding collecting area is to increase the size of each antenna while leaving the number and distribution of antennas the same .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is that the correlation load is unchanged , however , the gain in sensitivity is only proportional to @xmath87 because the field of view of the array is reduced , effectively decreasing the number of independent measurements .",
    "mathematically this can be seen by scaling with respect to @xmath43 with @xmath95 since the average number of measurements per cell increases with the cell size . *",
    "* fewer elements per antenna @xmath96 .",
    "* an alternative to adding collecting area is to simply increase the number of antennas by putting fewer detection elements into each antenna group .",
    "this increases the correlation load , but the sensitivity also increases with @xmath97 because the field of view increases .",
    "mathematically , vary with respect to @xmath43 again , but this time @xmath98 because the total number of visibility measurements scales as @xmath99 but the average increases linearly with the cell size . *",
    "* increasing bandwidth @xmath100 . *",
    "increasing the bandwidth adds entirely new measurements without increasing the sensitivity of the array to the line emission of individual h@xmath101 regions , so the sensitivity scales with the number of new measurements as @xmath78 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath102 and the density of measurements per cell @xmath92 is independent of the bandwidth ( cell size decreases with increase in number of frequency channels ) .",
    "* * sensitivity as a function of wavenumber @xmath103 . *",
    "as one moves to larger wavenumbers ( smaller length scales ) , the number of cells increases as @xmath104 leading to a linear dependence of the sensitivity on @xmath105 .",
    "of course this is very sensitive to the density of measurements at that wavenumber @xmath92 as discussed in section [ configurationsec ] . *",
    "* increasing integration time @xmath106 . *",
    "increasing the total observation time decreases the uncertainty on each measurement , leading to a linear increase in sensitivity with duration .",
    "this somewhat counterintuitive result is because the power spectrum is related to the square of the intensity .",
    "it should be remembered that these scaling relationships are only valid when the signal - to - noise ratio is small in each cell .",
    "@xcite gives a nice description of the transition from noise to statistics dominated uncertainty and the scaling within the noise dominated regime for cmb interferometers .",
    "these scaling relationships can help array designers determine the effects of their design choices , and are useful for comparing the sensitivity of different eor arrays .",
    "in the next section the effects of antenna placement are further explored .",
    "one of the unusual properties of interferometric arrays is that the distribution of visibility measurements is easily adjusted by altering the layout of the antennas .",
    "this freedom allows one to fine tune the characteristics of the array to maximize the scientific return . in this section",
    "we explore the effects of antenna layout on the eor power spectrum sensitivity .    the quantity @xmath92 represents the average number of measurements per fourier cell in a spherical annulus of radius @xmath105 .",
    "this can be calculated from average number of measurements in each individual cell @xmath59 by averaging over all the cells at that annulus @xmath107 where @xmath108 is measured from the @xmath109 axis , and @xmath110 is the azimuthal angle and ranges from @xmath111 since we only integrate over half the sphere because the visibilities are hermitian .",
    "this relationship can be simplified by concentrating on the spatial distribution of the visibility measurements .",
    "if we neglect the small distortion introduced by fractional bandwidth , the density of measurements per cell is constant for all cells at a position @xmath112 , independent of @xmath109 .",
    "this is because each baseline measures all frequency values , thus the density of measurements is just a function of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "if we use polar coordinates @xmath115 and @xmath110 to represent the position of a baseline in the @xmath116 plane ( see figure [ distsensitivity ] ) , equation [ ntrueavg ] can be simplified to @xmath117 after carrying out the integral in the denominator and changing variables .",
    "@xmath118 is simply the average number of baselines within a two dimensional cell in the @xmath116 plane during the course of the observation . for many experiments",
    "the @xmath116 coverage is very nearly azimuthally symmetric , allowing one to simplify even further to obtain @xmath119    under closer inspection , equation [ nsimpleavg ] provides a very interesting result : the sensitivity of the array at a given scale @xmath105 depends on all the visibility measurements with a spacing equal to or less than this scale .",
    "the very shortest baselines still contribute to measurements normally associated with much larger antenna spacings .",
    "the reason for this effect is the three dimensional distribution of the measurements shown in figure [ distsensitivity ] .",
    "because spatial information related to the line - of - sight distance is encoded in the observed frequency , very short baselines still contain information about very large @xmath105 at the appropriate @xmath109 value .",
    "the weighting of the baseline contributions has the same pattern as limb brightening .",
    "this means that the sensitivity of an eor interferometer as a function of scale is fundamentally different than a cmb interferometer .",
    "some of the sensitivity distributions which have appeared in the literature implicitly assume a single frequency of observation ( 2d ) and do not accurately represent the scale dependence of proposed measurements .",
    "figure [ sensitivitywscale ] shows the scale dependence of the sensitivity for two example antenna distributions .",
    "the uniform @xmath116 coverage distribution is very difficult to realize in practice , but does approximate the @xmath116 distribution generated by a ring of antennas and has been used as a simplifying assumption in the literature .",
    "the other distribution is for a centrally condensed array with a @xmath120 distribution , approximately the distribution given by a centrally condensed antenna distribution .",
    "the highest spatial frequency which can be observed in the @xmath109 dimension is set by the inverse of the frequency channel resolution , and is determined by the design of the correlator . for most interferometers narrow",
    "channel widths lead to the @xmath109 dimension of the observation extending to much larger values than the @xmath113 and @xmath114 dimensions .",
    "this leads to edge effects where the annulus becomes larger than the longest baseline and then larger than the @xmath109 extent ( see figure [ sensitivitywscale ] ) .",
    "the ideal antenna configuration depends both on the scales of @xmath105 which provide the best differentiation between models and the need to minimize systematics .",
    "neglecting systematics favors very compact arrays since short baselines will still contribute to large @xmath105 measurements through the frequency domain . however , realistic eor interferometers are all expected to include longer baselines .",
    "these longer baselines are crucial for identifying and removing a host of systematic effects , such as the point source foreground , ionospheric refraction , radio interference and radio transients . determining the optimum array layout will require an accurate model of the expected signal , the contaminating effects , and the analysis method , but will likely result in a centrally condensed array with a diameter of a couple of kilometers .",
    "this paper has developed the formalism needed to calculate the power spectrum sensitivity of multi - wavelength eor observations and has explored the implications for array design . by examining the scaling relationships and the effects of antenna distribution on the sensitivity",
    ", design trade - offs can be balanced against one another .",
    "it is hoped that this work will help optimize the design of low frequency radio telescopes for eor observations .",
    "i would like to thank colin lonsdale , roger cappallo , and jackie hewitt for carefully reading and correcting early drafts .",
    "i would also like to thank the entire mileura wide - field array team for blazing the path towards building a premier eor observatory in western australia .",
