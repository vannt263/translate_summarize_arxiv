    "oscillations of three generation neutrinos are parametrized by two mass squared differences , three mixing angles , and one cp violating phase . among these parameters , a tiny mixing angle @xmath2 and the phase @xmath3 have not been measured yet .",
    "measuring tiny effects of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the main purpose of future oscillation experiments . on the other hand",
    ", such precision measurements will be sensitive to effects of new physics also . in this talk",
    ", we investigate possibilities to see new physics effects on the @xmath0 appearance search with @xmath4 beam in the minos experiment  @xcite .",
    "this talk is based on @xcite .",
    "we consider the non - standard interaction ( nsi ) of neutrinos with matter as an example of new physics .",
    "the interaction is introduced in a model - independent way by the following effective lagrangian @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 stand for flavors , @xmath9 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) denotes the projection operator onto the left - handed one or the right - handed one , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) represents the fermions existing in matter .",
    "then , the hamiltonian in the flavor basis is modified from the standard one and it is given by @xmath14 \\epsilon_{e\\mu}^\\ast & \\epsilon_{\\mu\\mu } & \\epsilon_{\\mu\\tau}\\\\[2 mm ] \\epsilon_{e\\tau}^\\ast & \\epsilon_{\\mu\\tau}^\\ast & \\epsilon_{\\tau\\tau } \\end{array } \\right ) , \\label{matterv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 with the electron number density @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the first term of the right hand - side of ( [ matterv ] ) is for the oscillation in vacuum and the second term is the matter potential with nsi . in this talk ,",
    "a typical matter density @xmath18 is used and then we have @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , the size of the vacuum part of the hamiltonian are controlled by @xmath20 , and it is @xmath21 for the minos experiment .",
    "thus , we expect some nsi effect in the minos experiment if @xmath22 can be @xmath23 .     +",
    "experiments involving charged leptons strongly bound the effective interaction ( @xmath24 ) if @xmath25 symmetry is imposed . from a model independent point of view",
    ", however , the strength @xmath26 of the interaction ( @xmath24 ) can be independent of the strength of the charged lepton version of ( @xmath24 ) because we know @xmath25 is broken .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 can be constrained only by experiments with neutrinos .",
    "are obtained by experiments with muon through loop effects . ] using the results obtained in @xcite , we have constraints on the elements of ( [ matterv ] ) .",
    "we put @xmath27 because they are constrained enough .",
    "the constraints on @xmath28 and @xmath29 are @xmath30 the constraint on @xmath31 in @xcite is rather loose but it is improved by the atmospheric neutrino measurement and the k2k experiment  @xcite . in order to reproduce the observed @xmath32 disappearance for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which is @xmath35 , the parameters in vacuum ( @xmath1 , @xmath36 ) and non - standard interactions should satisfy @xmath37 & & \\hspace*{-10 mm } \\cos{2\\theta_{23}}\\nonumber\\\\[-1 mm ] & & \\hspace*{-5 mm } = \\frac { s_\\beta^2(1+c_\\beta^2 ) + 4 c_\\beta^2 \\cot{2\\theta_{23}^{\\text{obs } } } \\sqrt { ( 1+\\cot^2\\!{2\\theta_{23}^{\\text{obs } } } ) } } { ( 1+c_\\beta^2)^2 + 4\\,c_\\beta^2\\,\\cot^2\\ ! { 2\\theta_{23}^{\\text{obs } } } } , \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-10 mm } \\delta m^2_{31 } = \\frac{2 \\left ( \\delta m^2_{31 } \\right)^{\\text{obs } } } { \\sqrt { \\ { ( 1+c_\\beta^2 ) \\cos{2\\theta_{23 } } - s_\\beta^2 \\}^2   + 4 c_\\beta^2 \\sin^2\\!{2\\theta_{23 } } } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in order to be consistent with the sub - gev data of atmospheric @xmath32 , where the matter effect is suppressed , the parameters in vacuum should satisfy @xmath43 the conditions give an upper - bound on @xmath44 , and then we can constrain @xmath31 also as @xmath45 .",
    "we use the conditions ( [ atmk2k])-([subgev ] ) for also the case with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for simplicity .",
    "in our analysis , we calculate numbers of @xmath0 events ( signal and background ) for 13 bins of 0.5gev width within 1 - 7.5gev of the reconstructed energy .",
    "we assume @xmath48pot which corresponds to about 5 years of running .",
    "systematic errors are ignored for simplicity .",
    "two parameters are fixed as @xmath49 , @xmath50 throughout this talk .",
    "+    first , we investigate the possibility to see the effect of nsi in the minos experiment .",
    "`` data '' are generated with nsi and we try to fit the `` data '' without nsi .",
    "if the @xmath51 that corresponds to the fitting is larger than 4.6 , it means that the minos experiment can excludethe case with @xmath52 and see the nsi effect at 90%cl .   can be obtained in the future reactor experiments , we try to extract information about @xmath28 and @xmath29 only . therefore , we rely on the analysis for 2 degrees of freedom in which @xmath53 corresponds to 90%cl .",
    "if we try to extract information about @xmath2 also , we should use the analysis for 3 degrees of freedom and then the results get worse with @xmath54 . ] for the generation of the `` data '' with nsi , we use @xmath55 we fix @xmath56 also but take several values for that . on the other hand ,",
    "the values of parameters for fitting without nsi are @xmath57 @xmath51 is minimized with respect to @xmath2 within the region . note that the choice of ( [ max ] ) is for large @xmath58 in the standard oscillation , and hence it is a pessimistic one for the search of the nsi effect .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sens ] .",
    "the region above the dash - dotted line has been excluded by @xmath59 obtained with ( [ subgev ] ) and ( [ obs ] ) .",
    "the thin dashed , thin solid , bold dashed , and bold solid curves are results for @xmath60 , and 0.16 , respectively ; if nature chooses true values above the curves , the number of @xmath0 appearance signal becomes so large that can not be explain with @xmath2 only .",
    "then , it is possible to see the nsi effect in the minos experiment .",
    "next , let us consider the case without @xmath0 appearance signal . in this case",
    ", bounds on @xmath61 will be obtained by the search .",
    "`` data '' for the analysis is generated by @xmath62 and we try to fit the `` data '' by using nsi .",
    "if the fitting is failed , we can exclude the values of @xmath61 .",
    "for the fitting procedure , we use @xmath63 note that phases appear as @xmath64 approximately , which is exact for @xmath33 , and then we can put @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath51 for this analysis is minimized with respect to @xmath2 and three values of @xmath66 .",
    "the smallest and the largest values of @xmath66 are obtained from @xmath67 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound ] , results for @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are shown by thin dashed , thin solid , bold dashed , and bold solid curves .",
    "the region bellow the curves can be consistent with the case of no @xmath0 appearance at 90%cl , and then we should take the bold solid curve as a pessimistic choice for the exclusion of @xmath61 in the minos experiment .",
    "the dash - dotted line is given by ( [ subgev ] ) and the region above the line has been excluded by atmospheric neutrino measurement and the k2k experiment . hence , the gray region shows the possible improvement of the bound on @xmath61 in the minos experiment .",
    "we have investigated possibilities to obtain information about nsi effect with the search of @xmath70 oscillation in the minos experiment .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to find the effect in the experiment .",
    "even if the experiment does not find @xmath0 appearance signal , some part of @xmath28-@xmath71 space can be excluded by the result . therefore ,",
    "ongoing and future oscillation experiments are very interesting not only for the precise determination of the mixing parameter in the lepton sector but also for the new physics search .",
