    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics gives a very economical description of the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry , but it does not explain its origin .",
    "in fact , there are several arguments which suggest to go beyond the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) mechanism of the standard model .",
    "the main argument is that of the excessive fine - tuning in the higgs mass ( hierarchy problem ) : the higgs mass parameter receives large radiative corrections , the largest one from the top quark , that make unnatural the higgs mass stabilization at the electro - weak scale @xmath3 gev , if we admit the validity of the theory up to scales higher than the tev . + a possible solution ,",
    "besides supersymmetry , is based on an analogy with the pion mass stabilization in qcd : the higgs , similarly to the pion , might be a composite state , generated by a new strong dynamics ; as such , its mass is not sensitive to radiative corrections above the compositeness scale , assumed to be of the order of the tev scale .",
    "a further protection , that allows the higgs to be naturally lighter than the other resonances , exists if the composite higgs is also the pseudo - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken global symmetry @xcite .",
    "a pseudo - goldstone boson higgs is expected to be light and as such in agreement with the indication from the lep electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) . the new strong dynamics could be also realized by the bulk of an extra dimension .",
    "indeed the composite higgs scenario is related via the ads / cft correspondence @xcite to the randall sundrum framework of a warped extra dimension @xcite .",
    "+ new fermions and new gauge bosons , partners of the sm ones , are expected to emerge from the strong sector at approximately the tev scale , as suggested by the naturalness principle ( indeed , the partner sector , in particular the top one , operates in the radiative correction to the higgs mass , stabilizing it ) . the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , by probing the tev energy range , will be able to test the ewsb mechanism and produce these new states .",
    "the aim of this project is studying the phenomenology of composite higgs models ( chm ) and the lhc potential to discover these new states . in this thesis",
    "we will reconsider the bounds on the chm spectrum that come from flavor observables , with a special focus to @xmath4 .",
    "guided by the results of this analysis , we will consider the implication of such bounds on the phenomenology of these models at the lhc and we design a new strategy for discovering the heavy colored resonances which appear in the spectrum .",
    "+ instead of considering a full theory we will work in an effective description valid at low energy . in particular , we will refer to a `` two - site '' ( ts ) description @xcite , where two sectors , the weakly - coupled sector of the elementary fields and the composite sector , that comprises the higgs , are linearly coupled each other through mass mixing terms @xcite .",
    "after diagonalization the elementary / composite basis rotates to the mass eigenstate one , made up of sm and heavy states that are admixture of elementary and composite modes .",
    "heavier particles have larger degrees of compositeness : heavy sm particles , like the top , are more composite while the light ones are almost elementary . in these theories",
    "the higgs arises as a fully composite state and so it interacts with the sm and heavy particles only via their composite components .",
    "this can explain , if the right - handed bottom quark has a small degree of compositeness , the small ratio between the bottom and the top quark masses .",
    "+ the model has to be compatible with the experimental data , in particular the lep precision data suggest the presence of a custodial symmetry in the composite sector to avoid large corrections to the @xmath5 parameter .",
    "the absence of large flavor - changing neutral currents is achieved , instead , by a sort of gim mechanism , that naturally emerges when the connection between the elementary and the strong sector proceeds via linear couplings . in absence of a symmetry protection",
    ", the lep data also point toward a small degree of compositeness of the left - handed bottom quark ( small corrections to @xmath6 ) , and , by gauge invariance , of the left - handed top as well .",
    "this implies that , in order to obtain a heavy enough top quark , it is necessary to have an almost fully composite right - handed top quark .",
    "it has been shown , however , that the corrections to @xmath6 can be suppressed if the custodial symmetry of the strong sector includes a left - right parity @xcite .",
    "this can allow for a smaller right - handed top compositeness .",
    "+ in order to study the phenomenology at energies lower than the compositeness scale , we derive two different models , which we denote as ts5 and ts10 .",
    "they describe the low - energy regime of the minimal composite higgs models ( mchm ) defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the limit in which only the leading terms in an expansion in powers of the higgs field are retained . in mchm",
    "the higgs arises as the pseudo - goldstone boson associated to the @xmath7 breaking in the composite sector ; where @xmath8 includes @xmath9 as well as a parity @xmath10 which exchanges @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "composite fermions are embedded in a @xmath13 representation of @xmath14 in the ts5 model and in a @xmath15 in the ts10 . in both the cases we consider , for the analysis at the lhc , the presence of a @xmath10 symmetry protection to the @xmath16 coupling .",
    "+ we find two important bounds on the masses of the heavy fermions which do not depend on the flavor structure of the sector beyond the sm ( bsm ) .",
    "the first comes from the measurement of the @xmath16 coupling , that we already mentioned and that can be suppressed assuming a @xmath10 symmetry .",
    "the second is obtained from the infrared ( ir ) contribution to @xmath1 induced by the flavor conserving effective vertex @xmath2 . in composite higgs models",
    "there are two classes of effects that lead to a shift of the @xmath17 decaying rate compared to the sm prediction : loops of heavy fermion resonances from the strong sector give a ultraviolet ( uv ) local contribution ; they generate , at the compositeness scale , the flavor - violating dipole operators @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which define the effective hamiltonian for the @xmath17 decay .",
    "the virtual exchange of heavy resonances also generates the effective v+a interaction of the @xmath20 boson and the sm quarks , @xmath21 , which in turn leads to a shift to @xmath22 via a loop of sm particles .",
    "this latter ir contribution is enhanced by a chiral factor @xmath23 and , since in this case the flavor violation comes entirely from the sm v - a current , @xmath24 , it gives a minimal flavor violating ( mfv ) lower bound on the heavy fermion masses .",
    "+ we also discuss the role of a parity @xmath25 , which is a subgroup of the custodial @xmath26 , to protect the effective coupling @xmath27 , which is generated by the @xmath20 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 interactions with the composite sector .",
    "+ in general , stronger bounds can be obtained from the uv chm contribution to @xmath4 and from @xmath30 @xcite ; however , these latter bounds are model dependent and in principle could be loosened by acting on the np flavor structure .",
    "the bound from the ir contribution to @xmath4 , on the other hand , is robust , since it is a mfv effect .",
    "as such it can not be ignored in a phenomenological study on heavy fermions .",
    "+ in the second part of the thesis we perform a study of the lhc discovery reach on a heavy gluon ( @xmath0 ) and heavy fermions ( top and bottom excitations ) , coming from a new composite sector .",
    "the heavy partner of the gluon has a large degree of compositeness and , as a consequence , it has larger couplings to the heavier particles ( which are also those with larger degrees of compositeness ) .",
    "we find that heavy fermion resonances have a great impact on the composite gluon phenomenology : the @xmath0 phenomenology is strongly dependent on the ratio between @xmath31 mass and heavy fermions mass , @xmath32 ; according to its value we can distinguish three scenarios with different phenomenological implications for the @xmath31 search at the lhc",
    ". in the scenario where the @xmath0 is below the threshold for the production of a heavy fermion ( @xmath33 ) , in general @xmath0 decays preferentially to top pairs . in this case",
    "the signal is @xmath34 and it is affected by a huge and difficult to reduce qcd background , @xmath35 , that makes the @xmath31 discovery at the lhc particularly challenging .",
    "however , the study in ref .",
    "@xcite , by exploiting peculiarities of the signal , such as the large invariant mass of the @xmath36 pairs and a left - right asymmetry , shows that the discovery of a @xmath31 lighter than @xmath37 tev is possible at 14 tev lhc , with @xmath38 fb@xmath39 .",
    "+ if @xmath0 is heavier than fermionic resonances , the branching ratios for the @xmath0 decays into one heavy fermion ( @xmath40 ) plus its standard model partner ( @xmath41 ) become relevant and they also increase in the case of a not fully composite right - handed top .",
    "the analysis we perform considering these decay channels is very promising since the presence of heavy fermion resonances in the signal allows for a clean distinction between the signal and the background .",
    "we point out that there is also a third pessimistic scenario , corresponding to the case of a very heavy @xmath0 , with a mass greater than heavy fermion pairs . in this case",
    "the @xmath0 total decay width becomes too large ( o(tev ) ) to distinguish its resonance from the background .",
    "in our analysis we consider the channels where @xmath0 decays into one heavy fermion plus its standard model partner .",
    "the search in these channels is very promising , with the possibility for both the @xmath0 and heavy fermions discovery at the early stage of the lhc .",
    "these channels offer also the possibility to extract important information on the parameters of the model , such as the top degree of compositeness .",
    "+ most of the results we will show in the first part of the thesis are also discussed in @xcite , those in the second part have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the importance of the heavy - light channels in the search for heavy colored vectors at the lhc has also been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , which appeared after completion of this work .",
    "the idea behind composite higgs models is that the electro weak symmetry breaking may be triggered by a new strong dynamics , in analogy with the chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . in these theories a new strong sector couples to a weakly coupled sector , which coincides with that of the standard model without the higgs .",
    "the higgs , as the pion in qcd , is a composite state coming from the latter strong dynamics .",
    "its composite nature allows for a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "indeed , its mass is not sensitive to radiative corrections above the compositeness scale , assumed to be of the order of the tev.the ewsb is transmitted to sm fermions by means of linear couplings @xcite ( generated by some uv physics at the uv scale @xmath42 ) between elementary fermions @xmath41 and composite fermions @xmath43 this way to communicate the ewsb can give a natural explanation of the hierarchies in the quark masses ( through rg evolution of the composite - elementary couplings @xmath44 ) and avoid the tension which occurs when trying to generate large enough quark masses and , at the same time , suppressing fcnc processes .",
    "+ as a consequence of linear couplings a scenario of _ partial compositeness _ of the sm particles emerges . at energies below the compositeness",
    "scale a composite operator @xmath45 can excite from the vacuum a tower of composite fermions of increasing mass .",
    "linear couplings ( [ lincoup ] ) thus turn into mass mixing terms between elementary fermions and towers of composite fermions @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 because of the mass mixing terms the physical eigenstates , made up of sm and ( new ) heavy states , are admixture of elementary and composite modes .",
    "+ the low - energy phenomenology of such theories can be exhaustively studied , and calculation can be made easier , by considering a truncation of each tower of composite fermions to the first resonance , while other heavy states are neglected @xcite .",
    "for example , the effective lagrangian describing one elementary chiral field @xmath49 and its composite partner @xmath40 is @xmath50 we can rotate the fermions from the elementary / composite basis to the mass eigenstate one , the light(sm)/heavy basis , according to : @xmath51 our eigenstate fields are thus a heavy fermion of mass @xmath52 and a light fermion , to be identified with the sm field , that will acquire a mass after the ewsb . these fields ,",
    "as we see , are superpositions of elementary and composite states . the angle @xmath53 parametrizes the degree of compositeness of the physical fields .",
    "in particular , the sm fermion has a @xmath54 degree of compositeness ( and a @xmath55 degree of elementarity ) ; the mass mixing parameter @xmath56 can be naturally much smaller than the mass @xmath57 of the composite fermion parameters also allows for a sort of gim mechanism that suppresses large flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "] , therefore , sm fermions are in general mostly elementary with a small degree of compositeness , while heavy fermions are mostly composite with a small degree of elementarity . we have a similar rotation , with angle @xmath58 , in the case of right - handed fermions .",
    "sm fermions acquire a mass after the ewsb ; since the origin of this breaking resides , by assumption , in the composite sector ( the higgs is a fully composite state ) , the sm fermion mass arises from the composite part of left - handed and right - handed sm fields : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a yukawa coupling among composites , from which the sm yukawa @xmath61 originates . in the following",
    "we will assume that the strong sector is flavor anarchic , so that there is no large hierarchy between elements within each matrix @xmath60 and the hierarchy in the masses and mixings of the sm quarks comes entirely from the hierarchy in the elementary / composite mixing angles ( such ` anarchic scenario ' has been extensively studied in the framework of 5d warped models , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . from ( [ mass ] ) we can see that heavier sm particles have larger degrees of compositeness : heavy sm particles , like the top , have to be quite composite while the light ones are almost elementary .",
    "+ there are also elementary / composite mixings for the vector fields ( similarly to the @xmath5-photon mixing in qcd ) : @xmath62 bosons rotate from the elementary / composite basis to the physical light / heavy basis according to @xmath63 we have the following relations among sm coupling and elementary / composite couplings : @xmath64 in particular , the sm gluon and the heavy gluon @xmath0 have the following superpositions with elementary and composite modes : @xmath65    @xmath66     + experimental data give hints on the type of the new strong dynamics responsible for the ewsb .",
    "the lep precision data suggest the presence of a custodial symmetry in the composite sector to avoid large corrections to the @xmath5 parameter . in order to protect @xmath5 ( or equivalently the peskin - takeuchi t parameter )",
    "the composite sector must respect , minimally , a global symmetry : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is broken to the diagonal @xmath26 after the ewsb ; the unbroken @xmath26 invariance acts as a custodial symmetry so that @xmath69 at tree level .",

    "the comparison proves that the @xmath708 channel is very promising also for the discovery of the heavy fermions and should be taken into account , together with the ordinary single and pair production channels , in the searches for heavy fermions at the lhc .      the limit case of an almost fully composite left - handed top ( @xmath730 , @xmath731 ) is evaluated for @xmath732 .",
    "since , as we discussed , @xmath305 and @xmath596 are related to each other as @xmath733 , the specific @xmath596 values for which @xmath734 and the @xmath0 decays into custodian pairs become dominant depend on the value of @xmath60 . ]",
    "makes difficult the discovery of the @xmath0 both in the @xmath36 and in the @xmath451 channel .",
    "this is due to the predominance of the @xmath0 decays into pairs of custodians .",
    "+ in the ts5 the custodians @xmath173 and @xmath172 become light when the left - handed top becomes composite . as a consequence , for @xmath731 ,",
    "when the @xmath31 mass is above the threshold for the production of custodian pairs , the decays into custodians become dominant ( fig.s [ br_sr04 ] and [ br_channels_sr04 ] ) .",
    "+ in this limit case , the search for the @xmath0 in the one heavy plus one sm fermion channel becomes less promising than in the ` standard ' scenario ; it could be interesting , instead , looking for the decays into custodian pairs .",
    "these latter can decay into a @xmath189 or a higgs plus a top ( @xmath735 ) or into a @xmath20 plus a top ( @xmath736 ) and so they can give final states such as @xmath737 , @xmath738 , @xmath739 or @xmath740 .",
    "+ we point out that in the ts10 model there are also custodians ( @xmath125 , @xmath183 ... ) that become light in the fully composite @xmath28 limit ( @xmath392 ) . therefore , in the ts10 , the @xmath0 discovery in the one heavy plus one sm fermion channel becomes quite difficult both in the fully composite @xmath146 and in the fully composite @xmath28 limit cases .",
    "however , these limit cases seem to be quite disfavored by data ; a fully composite @xmath146 is disfavored by electro - weak data @xcite both for the ts5 and the ts10 , since it brings to too high values of the @xmath338 and @xmath148 parameters . on the other hand , in the ts10 , the opposite case of a fully composite @xmath28 is disfavored by the data from @xmath1 : as we have found in the first part of this project ( sec . [ bsgamma ] ) , in the case of a fully composite @xmath28 , we obtain a strong constraint on the heavy fermion mass in the ts10 , because of the absence of a @xmath25 protection to the effective @xmath21 vertex .",
    "composite higgs models are among the compelling scenarios for physics beyond the standard model that can give an explanation of the origin of the ewsb and that are going to be tested at the lhc .",
    "+ in this thesis we have studied the phenomenology of this class of models . we have built two simple ` two - site ' models , the ts5 and the ts10 , which incorporate a custodial symmetry and a @xmath10 parity .",
    "+ in the first part we have reconsidered the bounds on the chm spectrum implied by flavor observables .",
    "we have found in particular that the ir contribution to @xmath4 induced by the flavor conserving effective vertex @xmath741 implies a robust minimal flavor violating bound on the mass ( @xmath57 ) of the new heavy fermions .",
    "the relevance of shifts to @xmath741 has been already pointed out in the literature , even though its importance in setting a bound on heavy fermion masses was unestimated in previous studies .",
    "we have also shown how this bound can be stronger in the case of the absence of a symmetry ( @xmath25 ) protection to the effective @xmath21 vertex .",
    "in particular , the constraints we have found are @xmath742 in the ts5 , and @xmath743 where @xmath257 denotes the @xmath146 degree of compositeness , in the ts10 .",
    "+ in addition to these bounds , we have calculated the constraints from the uv composite higgs model contribution to @xmath526 .",
    "our results have shown that these bounds can be stronger than those from the ir contribution but they are model dependent ; in particular they strongly depend on the assumptions made on the flavor structure of the composite sector .",
    "we have obtained an estimated limit @xmath744 in a specific np flavor scenario ( @xmath380 anarchic in the flavor space ) . + even stronger bounds",
    ", @xmath745 can be obtained from @xmath30 but , again , they are model dependent and in principle could be loosened by acting on the np flavor structure .",
    "the lower bounds on @xmath57 we have found from @xmath4 , instead , are robust mfv bounds that can not be evaded by acting on the np flavor structure .",
    "+ in the second part of the thesis we have studied in details the lhc phenomenology of the new heavy colored resonances .",
    "we have shown that heavy fermions have a great impact on the phenomenology of the heavy gluon ; if the composite gluon is heavier than composite fermions , as flavor observables strongly suggest , the search in the channels where @xmath0 decays into one heavy fermion plus its standard model partner is very promising .",
    "+ we have estimated the lhc sensitivity to the heavy colored vectors by analyzing these channels .",
    "our final results are summarized in fig .",

    "<S> + from the analysis of the bounds on the chm spectrum , we derive an important constraint on the masses of the heavy fermions which does not depend on the flavor structure of the sector beyond the sm . </S>",
    "<S> this bound is obtained from the infrared contribution to @xmath1 induced by the flavor - conserving effective vertex @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the presence of a custodial symmetry can play a role in protecting this effective coupling . </S>",
    "<S> studying the heavy colored vectors phenomenology , we find that heavy composite fermions have a great impact on the phenomenology of heavy composite gluon at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> if the composite gluon is heavier than the composite fermions , as flavor observables seem to suggest , the search in the channels where @xmath0 decays into one heavy fermion plus its standard model partner is very promising , with the possibility for both the @xmath0 and heavy fermions to be discovered at the early stage of the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> these channels offer also the possibility to extract important information on model s parameters , such as the top degree of compositeness .    </S>",
    "<S> i would like to thank roberto contino for supervision and collaboration in this work , for having been my ph.d . </S>",
    "<S> supervisor and having introduced me to the theory of composite higgs models . </S>",
    "<S> i thank silvano petrarca for his assistance during the first year of the ph.d . and </S>",
    "<S> encouragement . </S>",
    "<S> i thank barbara mele from whom i have learned the most of what i know about collider phenomenology and for comments on the second part of this thesis . </S>",
    "<S> i thank all my ph.d . colleagues and friends for the stimulating environment created . </S>",
    "<S> especially , i would like to thank alessandra mastrobuono battisti and francesco sanfilippo for many useful discussions and technical suggestions . </S>",
    "<S> i also thank nadia drenska for a suggestion regarding the root tool , that was particularly useful in the second part of this thesis . </S>"
