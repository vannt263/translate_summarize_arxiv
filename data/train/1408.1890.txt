    "theoretical investigations of quantum phase transitions in magnetic spin chains with three- and four - spin exchange interactions have revealed novel phases and ground - states with multiple periodic structures and unique entanglement properties  @xcite . in particular , the influence of magnetic fields on low - dimensional quantum spin systems with complex interactions is a subject of great interest that may lead to the observation of reentrant behaviors and high - field driven transitions  @xcite .",

    "the spins are subjected to a magnetic field with components in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "the interaction among the spins is dictated by a four - spin ising - like term .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system may be written as : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) are the components of the pauli operator , located at site @xmath3 .",

    "we investigate the ground - state properties of the hamiltonian model ( eq .  [ eq : hamilt1 ] ) by using two numerical methods : entanglement entropy and finite - size scaling .",
    "the first method is based on the behavior of von neumann entanglement entropy , which is mostly used in information theory .",
    "that method enables one to calculate the location of the quantum critical points with a relatively high degree of accuracy , as well as it provides a way to identify the nature of the transitions .",
    "in addition , the method makes it possible to determine the central charge of the associated conformal field theory with low computational cost , by using small lattice sizes  @xcite .",
    "the second method is based on finite - size scaling arguments , which can be used to determine the transition lines and global properties of the various ground - states  @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the entropy entanglement method and show how to use it to locate the boundary between quantum phases , and how to find the central charge of the associated conformal field theory .",
    "consider a spin chain of length @xmath27 that can be partitioned into two subsystems @xmath28 and @xmath29 of sizes @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "when the entire system is in a pure state @xmath32 , its entropy is zero .",
    "however , the entropy of each subsystem is finite and can be quantified by the von neumann entropy , defined as : @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the reduced density matrix of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the density matrix of the pure state .",
    "the von neumann entropy @xmath37 gives a reliable measure of the entanglement between the subsystem @xmath28 and the rest of the system @xmath29 .",

    "consider initially a system that undergoes a second - order phase transition when a parameter @xmath44 of its hamiltonian reaches a critical value @xmath45 .",
    "if the system is finite , the entanglement entropy difference remains finite for all values of @xmath44 , reaching a maximum at @xmath45 . as the size of the system @xmath27",
    "is increased , the peak of @xmath46 at @xmath45 becomes progressively narrower .",

    "although @xmath46 still shows a maximum at the transition point , it diminishes everywhere as @xmath47 .",

    "consider again a hamiltonian model that depends on a parameter @xmath44 that becomes critical at @xmath45 .",
    "it has been pointed out  @xcite that for a system undergoing a second - order phase transition , the energy gap between the two lowest energy states of the system , @xmath54 , vanishes at the infinite - size limit . for a finite system , at criticality",

    "the ground - state and the first excited state energies and their corresponding eigenstates are calculated as a function of @xmath44 by using a modified lanczos method  @xcite . to speed up the calculations we use trial initial vectors which are as close as possible to the actual ground state vectors .",
