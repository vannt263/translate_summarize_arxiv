    "atmospheric neutrinos originate from the decay of unstable particles produced by cosmic ray interactions in the upper atmosphere .",
    "the useful spectrum runs from about 200 mev to about 1330 mev .",
    "but flux extends to much higher energies .",
    "the super kamioka group has studied these out to about 10 gev .",
    "the higher energy sample is only about 21% of the size of the sample below 1330 mev .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos approximate the ideal of a two distance neutrino oscillation experiment .",
    "figure [ dist ] shows the log of the flight length for neutrinos as a function of the cosine of the zenith angle .",
    "events from below travel on the order of 8000 km .",
    "those coming from above travel on the order of 10 km .",
    "there is rather little solid angle at intermediate distances .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos provide a good mixture of electron and muon neutrinos since a significant number of the muons at these energies decay before reaching the ground .",
    "simple arguments suggest that the ratio of muon to electron neutrinos should be about 2 .",
    "to summarize , atmospheric neutrinos are a mixture of muon and electron neutrinos coming from hadronic and muon decays .",
    "the source is approximately at two distances that differ by three orders of magnitude .",
    "most of the flux spans about a factor of 7 in energy .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino anomaly@xcite is the observation of an apparent deficiency of muon type atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "the anomaly is believed to be evidence for neutrino oscillations@xcite . but some of the details and assumptions used in the analysis cast some doubt on the oscillation hypothesis .",
    "the neutrino sample is being drawn from natural sources which adds a degree of uncertainty .",
    "almost all analyses have assumed that the anomaly is restricted to the muon neutrinos and that the electron neutrino flux is a good normalizer .",
    "the ratio of observed to expected neutrino interactions is a measure of the possible reduction in the neutrino flux that is indicative of neutrino oscillations . due to a significant uncertainty in the overall flux normalization , as much as 25% ,",
    "the quality of the attenuation statistic is improved by normalizing to something which is better known .",
    "the value of @xmath7@xcite which attempts to normalize the muon neutrino flux to the electron neutrino flux is thought to have significantly smaller systematic errors , on the order of 5% .",
    "an advantage that @xmath8 has over other observables is that it maximizes the use of the data .",
    "it is insensitive to details of the angular correlation between neutrino direction and reconstructed lepton direction from the interaction .",
    "a disadvantage is that one is averaging over two different baselines so that if only the long distance sample has oscillated significantly the result will be diluted by the unoscillated sample from the shorter baseline .",
    "figure [ rnu ] illustrates the super kamioka measurement of @xmath8 .",
    "the vertical scale is @xmath9 which combines the observed data , @xmath8 with a fit parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the horizontal axis of figure [ rnu ] is the log@xmath11 of @xmath12 with @xmath0 in ev@xmath3 and @xmath13 measured in ev .",
    "the points at the center of the plot are taken from references @xcite and @xcite and are plotted with @xmath14 which is obtained from the super kamioka fit described in the next section . since , for these point @xmath14 the value of @xmath15 can be read off the graph .",
    "reference @xcite quotes @xmath16 for energies below 1330 mev .",
    "reference @xcite quotes @xmath17 for the higher energy sample .",
    "the diamond points in figure [ rnu ] are the same data but the values of @xmath10 and @xmath0 are a fit to these data points .",
    "the fit yields @xmath18 and @xmath19 ev@xmath3 .",
    "the points near the center , the super kamioka fit , would agree with the data much better if the points could be lowered .",
    "but to do this would require @xmath20 which is unphysical .",
    "it is difficult to assign a confidence level to our fit .",
    "the points share many common systematic errors .",
    "one would need to quantify these correlated errors in order to achieve a legitimate confidence interval .",
    "since we have plotted @xmath12 the higher energy data points are to the left .",
    "the @xmath0 mass scale is driven by the low value of @xmath8 measured for the higher energy data points . a reasonable fit can be obtained for @xmath2 ev@xmath3 . more details of the fit can be found in @xcite .",
    "the curve plotted in figure [ rnu ] is an integral over the distances of figure [ dist ] for @xmath15 . for single component neutrino oscillations",
    "the result is a function of @xmath12 and proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "the curve illustrates the structure expected from the two distance scales involved . at",
    "very small @xmath0 all path lengths are small compared to the oscillation length and so the value of @xmath8 is 1 . at very large @xmath0",
    "the oscillation length is small compared to all path lengths in the problem so that @xmath15 will be @xmath21 , for a range of intermediate values of @xmath0 one path length is large compared to the oscillation length and the other is small so that @xmath22 ,      figure [ rofe ] illustrates the energy dependence of @xmath8 for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "the figure was obtained by numerically integrating the honda 97 muon neutrino flux@xcite . for modest values of @xmath0",
    "the value of @xmath8 is energy independent over the range indicated .",
    "but it can never drop much below 0.75 . as @xmath0 rises portions of @xmath8",
    "drop to below 0.75 and start to approach 0.5 . only at values of @xmath0 of about 0.1",
    "ev@xmath3 is energy independence restored with @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ rofe ] was generated for @xmath14 , its maximum value .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath10 the allowed values of @xmath8 are greater .",
    "this plot supports the fit of figure [ rnu ] in that the only curve that gives an energy independent value for @xmath1 at a value of @xmath8 below @xmath240.75 is @xmath25 ev@xmath3    the curve of figure [ rnu ] was done assuming an isotropic flux .",
    "a check using the honda 97 flux reproduces the results to about 1% , except at the lowest energy point , e=250 mev , where the difference between isotropy and the calculated flux is less than about 3% for @xmath26 ev@xmath3 .",
    "the physical significance of a low value of @xmath8 , if interpreted in terms of only a muon deficiency due to muon neutrino oscillations integrated over energy and distance , is that both distance scales must participate .",
    "since the short distance scale is about 3 orders of magnitude shorter than the large one the favored value for @xmath0 must be comparably larger .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the change in the measured electron rate means that @xmath8 must have changed .",
    "@xmath8 rose from 0.61@xmath270.03 to 0.76@xmath270.04 .",
    "this rise in @xmath8 brings it from a region which is not consistent with the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations over approximately half of the solid angle to a value consistent with such a hypothesis .",
    "unfortunately there is no good reason to doubt the credibility of either data sample .",
    "super kamioka has combined these samples in their analyses .",
    "the oscillation analysis utilizes the electron events , which are not consistent through this period .",
    "@xmath8 depends on the ratio of observations to simulations .",
    "the simulations did not change in any significant way between these two periods@xcite    so there is clear evidence that the electron sample does not provide a reliable normalization for the analysis of atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "the assumption that the ratio of atmospheric electron to muon neutrino flux can be calculated to an accuracy of 5% is in error , unless some portion of the observed signal is not of atmospheric origin or is not neutrinos.@xcite    the original super kamioka paper on the atmospheric neutrino flux@xcite notes , `` using a detailed monte carlo simulation , the ratio @xmath28 was measured to be 0.61@xmath270.03(_stat_)@xmath270.05(_sys _ ) , consistent with previous results from the kaimiokande , imb and soudan-2 experiments , and smaller than expected from theoretical models of atmospheric neutrinos '' .",
    "this is no longer true .",
    "the 1998 data is not consistent with previous results of the super kamioka detector or any of the earlier experiments cited .",
    "an @xmath8 value of 0.76@xmath270.04 seems to be unique to this period .",
    "the multi - gev data sample has no evidence of a rate variation in 1998 .",
    "independent confirmation of the drop in event rate would help ally fears that it is due to instrumental or systematic effects .",
    "the super kamioka group has maintained very good monitoring of the detector performance @xcite so such an explanation seems unlikely .",
    "several factors indicate that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly may be more complicated than generally thought . in such cases , it is important to seek corroboration of the results from other experiments .",
    "it is also important to be aware of simplifying assumptions that may have gone into the interpretation or the analysis of the data",
    ". one must be careful not to ignore information simply because it is in conflict with a preferred solution .",
    "it would appear that the electron neutrinos can no longer be used for relative normalization , at least until the variation is understood . in the early days",
    "the anomaly was considered to be either a deficiency of muon like events or an excess of electron type events .",
    "in fact , the results looked a bit like a systematic error in the classification method used for electron and muon events . since a random error would move events from the larger population , the muons , to the smaller population , the electrons .",
    "the observed event rate for all events was much closer to most flux models than might be expected based the errors quoted for the estimates .",
    "studies using the independent muon decay signature corroborate the morphology based results for muon and electron classification .",
    "the `` neutrino '' events observed in underground detectors do not agree with expectations based on a simple source of atmospherically produced hadron and muon decays .",
    "uncertainties in these expectations does not provide much guidance as to what might be wrong .",
    "simple one component muon neutrino oscillations are unable to provide a convincing explanation for the small value of @xmath8 nor for recent apparent drop in the interaction rate .",
