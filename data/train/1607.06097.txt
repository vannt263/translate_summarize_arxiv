    "determining the nature of dark energy is one of the most pressing problems of modern cosmology .",
    "efforts have focused on measuring the dark energy equation of state @xmath6 , which is @xmath7 if dark energy is a cosmological constant ; any other value of @xmath6 means the dark energy density evolves in time ( copeland , sami & tsujikawa 2006 ) .",
    "the dark energy density dictates the universe s expansion through the friedmann equation , and so measuring the universe s size as a function of time or redshift constrains the equation of state . a number of techniques exist to do this ( weinberg et al . 2013 ) , one of the most prominent being the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) method .",
    "the bao method exploits a preferred scale imprinted on the baryon density at decoupling ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "prior to decoupling , the universe is a hot , dense , ionized plasma in which electrons couple to photons by thomson scattering and protons follow electrons under the coulomb force .",
    "primordially overdense regions are overpressured , and the radiation pressure , dominant at high redshift , launches spherical pressure - density ( sound ) waves of baryons and photons outwards from each overdensity at roughly @xmath9 ( sakharov 1966 ; peebles & yu 1970 ; sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 ; bond & efstathiou 1984 , 1987 ; holtzmann 1989 ; hu & sugiyama 1996 ; eisenstein & hu 1998 ; eisenstein , seo & white 2007 ) .",
    "these are the bao , and the sound waves travel outwards until decoupling , where they halt as the photons precipitously release them since thomson scattering is no longer effective . at the wavefront",
    "the baryon velocity is maximal and the late - time growing mode inherits the spatial structure of the velocity .",
    "the bao thus correlate the original overdensity with a sharp excess density of baryons a sound horizon ( roughly @xmath10 comoving ) away .",
    "once the universe is neutral , on large scales the baryons and the dark matter experience only gravity , so the two components converge and the excess density of baryons imprints on the total matter density ( hu & sugiyama 1996 ; eisenstein & hu 1998 ; slepian & eisenstein 2016a ) .",
    "when galaxies begin to form , they trace the matter density field and so the bao produce a slight excess of galaxy pairs separated by @xmath11 .",
    "this excess translates to a sharp , localized bao bump in the 2-point correlation function ( 2pcf ) of galaxies , which measures the excess probability over random of finding one galaxy at a given separation from another ; there are analogous bao features in the 2pcf s fourier - space analog the power spectrum .",
    "since the bao signal is produced by large - scale , pre - decoupling physics , it is frozen into the comoving distribution of galaxies . consequently measuring the bao scale from galaxy clustering in different redshift slices",
    "provides a differential history of the universe s expansion rate ( eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1998 ; blake & glazebrook 2003 ; hu & haiman 2003 ; linder 2003 ; seo & eisenstein 2003 ) .",
    "the bao scale is also imprinted on the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , since the density structure at that epoch determined the temperature .",
    "the cmb therefore offers an absolute scale for the bao method .",
    "thus far , the bao method has used the 2pcf of galaxies as well as the galaxy power spectrum to measure the cosmic distance scale to high precision . since the original detections of the bao bump in the 2pcf of galaxies ( cole et al .",
    "2005 ; eisenstein et al . 2005 ) , large - scale redshift surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) have yielded ever - increasing precision via the bao method . the current precision on the distance scale from the 2pcf / power spectrum is of order @xmath12 ( anderson et al . 2014 ; cuesta et al .",
    "2016 ; gil - marn et al .",
    "2016 ) , and future surveys such as dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) ( levi et al . 2013 ) and _ euclid _ ( laureijs et al . 2011 ) should achieve a factor of five improvement in precision . the lyman-@xmath13 forest has also been used for bao measurements , with the most recent results in delubac et al .",
    "the first detection of bao in voids has also recently been made , offering an additional possible avenue to the distance scale ( kitaura et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "until now the bao method has not explicitly used higher correlations of the galaxy density field .",
    "as earlier noted , the bao produce an excess of pairs of galaxies separated by @xmath14 , but the bao also imprint on triplets of galaxies , creating a slight excess of triangles where one or more triangle side is of the bao scale .",
    "triplets develop correlations both due to non - linear structure formation and non - linear bias .",
    "slepian & eisenstein ( 2016b ; hereafter se16b ) shows that there are distinctive bao features in the 3-point correlation function ( 3pcf ) of galaxies .",
    "detecting these features would enable a measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the 3pcf alone .",
    "thus far , only two previous works have measured the 3pcf on physical scales large enough to access the bao scale .",
    "gaztaaga et al .",
    "( 2009 ) used a sample of @xmath15 luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) from sdss dr7 .",
    "they find a @xmath16 detection of the bao using all opening angles of a single triangle configuration with side lengths @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "slepian et al .",
    "( 2015 ; hereafter s15 ) used @xmath0 lrgs from the cmass sample within sdss - iii boss to measure the 3pcf in a compressed basis where many triangle configurations were used but one of the two sides was integrated out over a wedge set by the remaining free side . that work found a @xmath19 detection of the bao .",
    "given the larger sample of s15 , by comparison to gaztaaga et al .",
    "( 2009 ) a higher significance bao detection might be expected , suggesting that there is bao information the compressed basis does not exploit . on the other hand , gaztaaga et al .",
    "( 2009 ) did find an anomalously high baryon fraction ( roughly double the presently - accepted value ) , which would increase the significance of a bao detection .",
    "neither work used these moderate - significance bao detections to measure the cosmic distance scale .    in this work",
    ", we use the same dataset and 3pcf measurement as s15 .",
    "however , we do not compress by integrating out one triangle side .",
    "the compression scheme of s15 was motivated by avoiding any triangle side s becoming small and two galaxies becoming close , where linear perturbation theory is likely a poor model . here",
    ", we avoid this limit by choosing triangle sides such that the smallest side never is below @xmath20 .",
    "we again use the novel algorithm of slepian & eisenstein ( 2015b , c ; hereafter se15b , c ) , which computes the 3pcf s multipole moments in @xmath21 time using spherical harmonic decompositions , where @xmath22 is the volume of a sphere of radius @xmath23 , the maximum triangle side length to which correlations are measured .",
    "the covariance matrix also turns out to be tractable in the multipole basis ( se15b ) .",
    "the main outcomes of this work are :    the first high - significance @xmath24 detection of the bao in the 3pcf . + a measurement of the cosmic distance scale at redshift @xmath25 to @xmath3 precision from the 3pcf .",
    "+ high precision ( @xmath26 ) determination of the linear bias at fixed @xmath27 for this sample from the 3pcf .",
    "+ an interesting subsidiary result of this work is that the tidal tensor bias @xmath28 ( further detailed in  [ sec : models ] ) of the dataset agrees well with the theoretically predicted relation with linear bias @xmath29 , @xmath30 $ ] ( baldauf et al .",
    "2012 ; chan , scoccimarro & sheth 2012 ) , offering mild evidence for the validity of local lagrangian biasing .",
    "in contrast , @xmath28 for the patchy mock catalogs for sdss dr12 ( described further in  [ sec : data_randoms_mocks ] ) does not agree with this theoretical relation . with our work s error bars on @xmath28 , the tension between mocks and data is only mild , but this possible misfit between the data and the patchy mocks as well as the patchy mocks and the theory may warrant further investigation .",

    "2015a , b ) .",
    "we passed these mocks through the same pipeline as the data including fitting bias models to them and considering the bao significance and distance information .",
    "briefly , these catalogs used second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ) combined with a spherical collapse model on small scales ( kitaura & he 2013 ) , and were calibrated on accurate n - body - based reference catalogs . the calibration used halo abundance matching to reproduce the number density , clustering bias , selection function , and survey geometry of the boss data ( rodrguez - torres et al .",
    "this work uses the basis of legendre polynomials @xmath36 for the dependence of the 3pcf on triangle opening angle ; we thus measure the 3pcf at each multipole as a function of the two triangle sides ( szapudi 2004 ; se15a ) .",
    "mathematically the full 3pcf @xmath37 is expanded as @xmath38 where @xmath36 is a legendre polynomial .",
    "we use the novel 3pcf algorithm of se15b , c to measure the multipole moments of the 3pcf . for details of the multipole basis and algorithm",
    "we refer the reader to se15b , c , with a shorter summary in s15 ; here we simply recapitulate its major advantages .",
    "first , the multipole basis underlies our algorithm to measure the 3pcf in a way scaling as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the number of galaxies in the survey and @xmath41 is the number density .",
    "a naive triplet count would scale as @xmath42 .",
    "there have been other 3pcf algorithms that improve upon the naive triple count , but they involve approximations and are not highly efficient for measuring the 3pcf on large scales . as shown in se15b , the algorithm is 500 times faster than a triplet count and only 6 times slower than a 2pcf computation .",
    "it allows us to measure the 3pcf for of order one million galaxies in a few minutes on modest computing resources ( runtimes are further detailed in se15b  5 ) .",
    "the speed advantage occurs because our algorithm relies on the computation of angular cross - power spectra between spherical shells centered iteratively on each galaxy in the survey .",
    "it has long been known how to quickly estimate the angular auto power spectrum of a given shell around one origin in the context of cmb analyses . given that these analyses use a large maximum multipole of order several thousand , for the cmb it is more efficient to grid the temperature anisotropy field and take a spherical harmonic transform scaling as @xmath43 , with @xmath44 the number of grid cells .",
    "the spherical harmonic coefficients can then be assembled into the multipole moments ( i.e. angular power spectrum ) .",
    "since for the 3pcf we only require a modest number of multipoles , our algorithm simply computes the spherical harmonic coefficients directly , which is more accurate since the density field never needs to be gridded .",
    "second , the multipole basis permits analytic calculation of the covariance matrix in terms of simple 2-d integrals of the linear power spectrum and spherical bessel functions ( se15b  6 ) if one assumes the dominant contribution is from an underlying gaussian - random field plus shot noise and ignores all connected terms in the 6-point function .",
    "this covariance matrix avoids the noise and consequent non - invertibility of a covariance matrix determined solely from mocks . to use this latter strategy",
    "one would need to determine @xmath45 independent matrix elements ; for the present work this number is @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , it is desirable to have many more than one mock per dimension of the covariance matrix to avoid noise ( percival et al .",
    "2014 ) . determining an invertible covariance matrix from mocks alone would thus require computing the 3pcf of a large number of mocks .",
    "consequently , in previous works on the 3pcf or bispectrum , a variety of assumptions about the structure of the covariance matrix and its eigenvalues have been adopted ( e.g. gaztaaga et al .",
    "2009 ; gil - marn et al .",
    "2015 ) . having an analytic covariance",
    "matrix avoids need for approximations in this regard .    third , edge - correction is straightforward in the multipole basis .",
    "details are presented in se15b  4 . here",
    "we note that measuring the 3pcf of a catalog of a large number of random points thrown in the survey volume is sufficient for accurate edge correction .",
    "the edge correction can be cast as a matrix inversion and performed as a post - processing step that takes negligible time .",
    "we use an analytic covariance matrix as computed in se15b  6 , with volume @xmath47 and survey number density @xmath41 ( shot noise scales as @xmath48 ) as free parameters to be fit from an empirical covariance matrix derived from @xmath49 mock catalogs . )",
    "was corrupted and we do not use it here . ] as earlier noted , our covariance matrix calculation assumes a gaussian random field for the density , but this assumption is reasonable given that the density field on large scales is only very weakly non - gaussian even at low redshifts .",
    "the covariance calculation is succinctly summarized in s15  6 , as is our procedure for fitting the best survey volume and number density from the mock catalogs .",
    "this latter procedure uses a likelihood metric proposed by xu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    to test our analytic covariance matrix @xmath50",
    ", we construct its half - inverse @xmath51 and apply symmetrically to the mock covariance matrix @xmath52 .",
    "if our analytic covariance matrix accurately describes the true independence structure of the 3pcf of the mocks , then we should have @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the identity matrix .",
    "a major advantage of this test is that it avoids ever inverting the mocks covariance matrix , which as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : method ] will be noisy at best and non - invertible at worst .",
    ", with volume and shot noise fixed by fitting to the mocks empirical covariance matrix ( though note the volume divides out of the reduced covariance ) .",
    "the reduced covariance matrix is the full covariance matrix divided by the geometric mean of the diagonal elements : @xmath55 .",
    "here multipole varies faster than bin pair ; thus the small tiles visible in the matrix are all multipoles for a given bin pair . ]    . given the 298 mocks , we expect root mean square noise in this plot of @xmath56 , as discussed in  [ sec : covar ] ; in reality it is @xmath57 . ]    in figure [ fig : reduced_covar ] , we show our analytic reduced covariance matrix with the best - fit volume @xmath58 ^ 3 $ ] and number density @xmath59^{-3}$ ] . in figure",
    "[ fig : covar_test ] , we show the half - inverse test ; it should look reasonably close to random noise . given that we used a finite number of mocks to estimate the matrix elements of @xmath52 , even were our analytic covariance matrix a perfect match to the true covariance of the mocks 3pcf , we would expect a root mean square scatter of @xmath60 . as an additional test we do not plot",
    ", we examined the eigenvalues of the mocks covariance matrix and the analytic covariance matrix and found fairly good agreement ; the deviations were consistent with noise from the small number of mocks used .",
    "we also computed the average ratio of the diagonal of the analytic covariance matrix to the diagonal of the empirical covariance formed from the mocks , finding @xmath61 , which for @xmath62 elements is within @xmath63 of unity , where @xmath64 .",
    "we fit two different models to the data in this work .",
    "first , we consider a model where the galaxy overdensity field @xmath65 traces the matter density field @xmath66 and its square with two unknown bias coefficients , the linear bias @xmath29 and the non - linear bias @xmath67 .",
    "this bias model is @xmath68,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expectation value is over translations and must be subtracted so that @xmath69 . to obtain the leading order ( fourth order ) 3pcf , the matter density field",
    "must be expanded to second order as @xmath70 @xmath71 is the linear density field and @xmath72 is @xmath73 and computed by integrating two copies of the fourier - transformed linear density field at different wavenumbers against the perturbation theory kernel @xmath74 ( bernardeau et al .",
    "this kernel encodes the evolution of the density under newtonian gravity . for gaussian - random - field initial conditions , this evolution is the reason the late - time field is non - gaussian on large scales and has a non - vanishing large - scale 3pcf .",
    "second , we consider a model where the galaxy overdensity traces the matter density field , its square , and the local tidal tensor @xmath75 with three unknown bias coefficients , @xmath29 , @xmath67 , and @xmath28 ( fry 1996 ; catelan et al .",
    "1998 ; catelan et al .",
    "2000 ; mcdonald & roy 2009 ; baldauf et al .",
    "2012 ; chan , scoccimarro & sheth 2012 ) .",
    "this bias model is @xmath76 \\nonumber\\\\ &   + b_t\\left [ s^2({\\vec{x } } ) - \\left < s^2({\\vec{x } } ) \\right>\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again we subtract expectation values where necessary to ensure @xmath77 .",
    "the local lagrangian bias model finds that @xmath30 $ ] , though this is only valid for large - scale modes and does not incorporate renormalization ( mcdonald 2006 ) .",
    "one can compute the 3pcf in two steps .",
    "first , one chooses a particular galaxy to sit at the origin . to simplify the calculation one then takes it that this galaxy always contributes the most complicated bias term to the triple product @xmath78 .",
    "the result of this computation is the pre - cyclic 3pcf . in reality , we do not know which galaxy sits at the origin of coordinates , or equivalently , contributes a particular bias term . consequently , the second step in computing the 3pcf is cyclically summing over all three possible choices of origin .",
    "this yields the full , post - cyclic 3pcf to be compared to observations . for further discussion ,",
    "see se15a and se16b .    in the multipole basis",
    ", the real - space pre - cyclic 3pcf is remarkably compact : it has only monopole @xmath79 , dipole @xmath80 , and quadrupole @xmath81 moments , as discussed in se15a , b and references therein . in redshift space , even at the pre - cyclic level all multipoles enter , but those at @xmath82 are all @xmath83 at leading order ( se16b ) , where @xmath84 for the cmass sample , with @xmath85 , @xmath86 the linear growth rate and @xmath87 the scale factor .",
    "thus even in redshift space most of the pre - cyclic structure is set by the monopole , dipole , and quadrupole , as further discussed in se16b .",
    "regarding redshift space , we also note that the model of se16b is fully self - consistent to leading order in the 3pcf ( i.e. fourth order in the linear density field ) and is not merely a kaiser treatment of rsd , as is the bispectrum model of scoccimarro , couchman & frieman ( 1998 ) on which se16b is based .",
    "cyclic summing then mixes each pre - cyclic multipole into all post - cyclic multipoles , as discussed in se15a  7 and se16b  4.1 . as regards the bao , the post - cyclic @xmath88 receives most of its structure from the pre - cyclic @xmath88 , with a sub - dominant contribution from the pre - cyclic @xmath89 .",
    "the post - cyclic @xmath89 receives most of its structure from the pre - cyclic @xmath89 , with a sub - dominant contribution from the pre - cyclic @xmath88 .",
    "the post - cyclic @xmath90 receives roughly equal contributions in amplitude from the pre - cyclic @xmath89 and @xmath90 , but essentially all of the bao structure in the post - cyclic @xmath90 comes from the pre - cyclic @xmath89 . for all of the higher post - cyclic multipoles ,",
    "again the bao structure comes almost entirely from the pre - cyclic @xmath89 .",
    "these couplings are shown in se16b figure 6 .",
    "we note that the higher post - cyclic multipoles ( @xmath91 ) all look rather similar to each other , as shown in se16b figures 6 - 8 ; this is because the information is all coming from a compact set of pre - cyclic multipoles .",
    "consequently we believe there is not significant additional information in the higher multipoles .",
    "thus while in principle the 3pcf has an infinite number of multipoles , in practice most of the information is likely in the first few .",
    "thus the multipole basis is a relatively compact basis for measuring the 3pcf and we likely do not lose much by stopping at @xmath92 as we do in this work .",
    "the full equations for the pre - cyclic model we use are given in se16b equation ( 21 ) ; these are then cyclically summed and reprojected onto the multipoles as discussed above .",
    "finally , we model a failure of the integral constraint in our fitting .",
    "the integral constraint demands that the average number density of randoms equal the average number density of galaxies , as discussed in more detail in s15  5.3 .",
    "we thus perturb our 3pcf estimator by rescaling the randoms by @xmath93 , and find that this induces an additional term in the measured 3pcf @xmath94 as @xmath95 as shown in s15 equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) ; @xmath96 is the true 3pcf .",
    "@xmath97 is the cyclic sum of the linear theory 2pcf @xmath98 around the three triangle sides , @xmath99 .",
    "anomalous large - scale power near the survey scale , such as from wide - angle observational systematics , would produce a similar distortion .",
    "though the rescaling of the randoms is as @xmath93 , moving forward , we will track @xmath100 as the integral constraint amplitude .      as shown in se16b ,",
    "the full 3pcf model is simply a set of integral transforms of the power spectrum . in the present work ,",
    "we use two different template power spectra .",
    "first , we use the physical power spectrum @xmath101 to compute the models .",
    "second , we use the no - wiggle power spectrum , which has the large - scale cdm growth correct but with all bao features removed .",
    "we use these two power spectrum templates because comparing the @xmath102 from fitting the data to each bias model with no - wiggle and physical power spectra gives a measure of the bao significance in the data .",
    "the physical power spectrum is the linear power spectrum with the bao component smoothed by a gaussian to model rsd and non - linear structure formation ( eisenstein , seo & white 2007 ; anderson et al .",
    "2012 ) : @xmath103\\exp\\left [ -k^2\\sigma_{\\rm nl}^2/2\\right ] + p_{\\rm nw}(k),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath104 the linear theory power spectrum .",
    "@xmath105 is the no - wiggle power spectrum and is computed from the fitting formula for the no - wiggle transfer function given in eisenstein & hu ( 1998 ) .",
    "@xmath106 is the non - linear smoothing scale .",
    "the power spectrum is always formed from the matter transfer function @xmath107 as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is an amplitude set by fixing @xmath27 today .",
    "we compute the transfer functions from code for anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( camb ; lewis 2000 ) using a geometrically flat @xmath110 cosmology with parameters matching those used for the multidark - patchy mock catalogs ( kitaura et al .",
    "2015 ) and consistent with the planck values ( planck paper xiii , 2015 ) .",
    "our cosmology also matches that used for s15 .",
    "the parameters are @xmath111 .",
    "we take the survey redshift to be @xmath112 , the average of the range @xmath113 ; this is a good approximation because the redshift distribution of objects is roughly symmetric about the middle of this interval ( reid et al .",
    "we rescale @xmath27 by the ratio of the linear growth factor at the survey redshift to the linear growth factor at redshift zero .",
    "a final aspect of our model is to vary the effective size of the universe at our survey redshift . within both the physical and no - wiggle templates",
    ", we allow the physical distances to be rescaled by a factor @xmath13 , where @xmath114 if our assumed fiducial cosmology is correct . given a 3pcf at multipole @xmath115 for the fiducial cosmology @xmath116 , our model 3pcf with varying @xmath13 will be @xmath117 .",
    "the sense of our rescaling is that @xmath118 moves the bao features to larger physical scales in the model , while @xmath119 moves the bao features to smaller physical scales in the model . for instance , a best fit value of @xmath120 will associate the observed bao with a model where they appear on larger scales than the fiducial cosmology .",
    "for both the physical and no - wiggle templates , we use @xmath13 in the range @xmath121 .",
    "varying @xmath13 allows us to measure the cosmic distance scale at the survey redshift relative to the sound horizon for the fiducial cosmology recorded above .",
    "our dilation or contraction rescales the 3pcf amplitude by roughly @xmath122 , since @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "since we do not renormalize to a fixed @xmath27 after dilation or contraction , changing @xmath13 induces a shift in @xmath29 , causing a substantial correlation of @xmath29 with @xmath13 .",
    "we briefly outline the triangle configurations used and then turn to our high - significance bao detection . as discussed in  [ sec : intro ] we wish to avoid triangles where any two galaxies are too close to each other such that non - linear structure formation has become important and linear perturbation theory likely provides a poor model .",
    "to acheive this we use all bins in @xmath125 where the minimum of any side is @xmath126 and the maximum of any side is @xmath127 .",
    "the @xmath20 minimum is dictated by avoiding squeezed triangles ; the maximum reflects a decision we have made that there is very limited signal to noise in larger scale bins .",
    "furthermore , there may be as - yet unresolved large - scale systematics in the survey that become dominant on these scales .",
    "in particular , we computed the half - inverse covariance matrix test for a number of different maximal scales and found that the analytic covariance matrix did not reproduce that derived from the mocks as well on larger scales .",
    "the choice of @xmath128 as a maximal scale was thus dictated by the likelihood of diminishing returns from larger scales and the concern that the covariance matrix on larger scales was not as well - controlled .",

    "we briefly describe our procedure for fitting the free parameters of the models presented in  [ sec : models ] to the data , as there are some dimensions of the problem that can be significantly accelerated due to the structure of the models .",
    "in particular , at fixed @xmath135 and @xmath100 , for the bias parameters ( @xmath136 and @xmath28 ) , our model is a sum with terms proportional to @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "these three combinations are independent , and thus the minimum @xmath102 for the total model is the sum of the minimum @xmath102 for each of these three terms .",
    "consequently rather than doing an expensive 3-d search in the space @xmath139 for our tidal tensor model or in the 2-d space @xmath140 for our minimal model , we can solve directly for the best @xmath29 , @xmath67 , and @xmath28 as a least - squares minimization gaussian likelihood problem .",
    "for each @xmath141 and @xmath100 , this procedure gives the best - fit biases .",
    "the procedure also returns the covariance matrix of these parameters @xmath142 as a function of @xmath143 , and @xmath100 .",

    "we explored fitting for @xmath134 but found essentially no constraint ; it is highly degenerate with @xmath29 , as se16b equation ( 21 ) suggests .",
    "we therefore elected to set @xmath144 using @xmath145 .",
    "consequently in this work the linear bias determines the value of @xmath134 , meaning that once we have recovered @xmath29 from our fit we must ensure that the @xmath134 used was consistent with it . since @xmath29 depends on both the model ( minimal or tidal tensor ) and the dataset ( true data or mocks ) , we consider four values of @xmath134 in this work .",
    "for the data , we use @xmath146 for the minimal model and @xmath147 for the tidal tensor model ; for the mocks , we use @xmath148 for the minimal model and @xmath149 for the tidal tensor model .",

    "to fit the integral constraint amplitude @xmath100 , we subtract our integral constraint model from the data itself and from the model .",
    "this subtraction casts the model fully in terms linear in the biases being fit , as detailed above .",
    "we use a grid of @xmath150 values of the integral constraint amplitude @xmath100 in the range @xmath151 to @xmath152 .      our fitting results in a surface of @xmath102 vs. @xmath13 and @xmath100 , as well as the best - fit biases and their covariance matrices at all values of @xmath13 and @xmath100 .",
    "we fit the dataset as well as 298 mock catalogs ; the runtime is a negligible fraction of the full 3pcf calculation .    given the @xmath102 surface , we wish to marginalize over the integral constraint amplitude @xmath100 .",

    "@xmath156 is the best - fit bias at a given @xmath13 and @xmath100 , while @xmath157 is the square root of the appropriate diagonal element of the bias covariance matrix at that @xmath13 and @xmath100 .",
    "we have neglected a factor of @xmath158 in these integrals ; this factor would account for changes in the covariance matrix with @xmath13 and @xmath100 .",
    "however , the covariance matrix does not change rapidly enough with @xmath13 and @xmath100 to argue for this complication .    setting @xmath159 in equation ( [ eqn : bias_expectation_value ] )",
    "gives the bias @xmath160 marginalized over @xmath100 , and setting @xmath161 gives the expectation value of its squate .",
    "using these two quantities we have the marginalized root mean square of the biases as @xmath162    the bias covariance matrices gave us the error bars on the biases at a given @xmath13 and @xmath100 ; equation ( [ eqn : bias_rms ] ) now gives us error bars on the biases at a given @xmath13 having accounted for the full posterior in @xmath100 .",
    "thus the error bar estimate from this marginalization will be greater than or equal to that from the bias covariance matrix : @xmath163 .",
    "we do not marginalize the biases over @xmath13 .",
    "doing so would correspond to accounting for uncertainties in the cosmological parameters when computing the biases .",
    "generally when one fits for biases the cosmology is known to much higher precision than the biases , and indeed if one did wish to marginalize the biases over @xmath13 here one would likely do so with an extremely restrictive prior on @xmath13 , as @xmath13 is quite well - constrained from e.g. the bao method in the 2pcf .",
    "rather , we simply select the bias and root mean square of the bias at the best - fit @xmath13 , i.e. the @xmath13 with the minimal @xmath102 .",
    "we also note that with the bias parameters in hand for each of 298 mock catalogs as well as the data , we have a third way of estimating the error bars on the biases .",
    "we can simply take the standard deviation of the best - fit biases over the 298 mocks : this is the scatter in the bias expected if we were to measure 298 realizations of the same underlying initial gaussian - random density field .      for the measurements of @xmath13 we report , we use a similar marginalization procedure to that in  [ subsec : bias_marginalization ] . here",

    "again we have neglected a factor of @xmath158 in these integrals for the same reasons as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : bias_marginalization ] .",
    "our marginalization procedure here results in a single value for @xmath166 for each catalog ; there is no need for further selecting the best - fit @xmath13 as this parameter has already been integrated out .",
    "analogously to  [ subsec : bias_marginalization ] , successively setting @xmath159 and @xmath161 we can obtain @xmath167 , the root mean square of @xmath13 . since , unlike the biases , @xmath13 was not fit in our gaussian likelihood approach , we do not have a covariance matrix error bar for @xmath168 .",
    "thus @xmath167 provides an important estimate of the error in the distance scale .",
    "we can also compute the standard deviation of @xmath168 over all 298 mock catalogs for a second estimate of the precision on @xmath168 .",
    "as we detailed in  [ sec : fitting_procedure ] , within each bias model ( minimal and tidal tensor ) we fit two templates to our data to assess the bao significance .",

    "however , reconstruction is known to introduce some distance information from the 3pcf back into the 2pcf , and further work will explore the impact of reconstruction on the independence of the distance scales . for the moment , we note that adding our distance scale to that measured from the unreconstructed 2pcf would produce a distance measurement with @xmath12 precision , comparable to the most recent precision of the distance scale measured from the reconstructed 2pcf ( cuesta et al .",
    "2016 ) or power spectrum ( gil - marn et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "holding @xmath27 fixed , we also place an extremely precise constraint on the linear bias , measuring @xmath29 to sub - percent accuracy in our minimal bias model .",
    "this constraint is the most precise placed on the linear bias from either the 3pcf or the bispectrum , and is competitive with the most precise constraints on @xmath29 placed using any other techniques .",
    "finally , we have made a moderate - confidence detection ( @xmath187 ) of tidal tensor bias in agreement with the prediction of local lagrangian biasing .",
    "our error bars on the tidal tensor bias remain large because the tidal tensor bias is highly degenerate with the linear bias as they enter the 3pcf . in future",
    "it will be worthwhile to explore avenues for breaking this degeneracy .",
    "the mocks do not appear to match the tidal tensor model well , but we do not expect this affects the bao significance . in particular , the bao significances are similar between our minimal and tidal tensor models , so the tidal tensor biasing is likely not a substantial driver of the bao significance .",
    "we note that the bispectrum has been used before to test tidal tensor biasing on observational data ; feldman et al . ( 2001 ) found very mild evidence in favor of eulerian biasing ( @xmath238 ) for the iras pscz galaxy catalog .",
    "this galaxy population is very different from the lrgs considered in this work and so there is no conflict with the moderate - confidence detection of tidal tensor bias we report here .    in a companion paper ( slepian et al .",
    "2016b ) , we use the same 3pcf dataset analyzed here with a different bias model to look for the imprint of baryon - dark matter relative velocities ( tseliakhovich & hirata 2010 ) in the late - time clustering of galaxies .",
    "this imprint can be an important possible systematic for bao measurements from the 2pcf or power spectrum ( yoo , dalal & seljak 2011 ) , and as discussed in slepian & eisenstein ( 2015a ) has a unique signature in the 3pcf .",
    "the companion paper finds that the 3pcf offers a @xmath239 constraint on any possible shift the relative velocity induces in the bao scale inferred from the 2pcf , arguing for the 3pcf s utility in protecting future redshift surveys from this possible bias .    in sum",
    ", the same spectroscopic data sets currently used for 2pcf analyses with the bao method can be used for 3pcf analyses with the bao method .",
    "we hope the 3pcf will offer a new avenue to the cosmic distance scale . used in conjunction with the 2pcf",
    ", we believe the 3pcf can increase the cosmological leverage of a given survey . with upcoming efforts such as desi providing of order @xmath240 million spectra ( levi et al .",
    "2013 ) , taking full advantage of the bao information in the 3pcf as well as that in the 2pcf will be highly desirable .",
