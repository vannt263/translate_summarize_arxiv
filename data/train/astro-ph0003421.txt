    "in the past few years a number of extrasolar giant planets have been discovered around nearby solar  type stars .",
    "these objects masses range from @xmath1  @xmath2  to @xmath3  @xmath2  ( where @xmath2  is jupiter s mass ) and their orbital semi - major axis range from @xmath4  au to @xmath5  au ( marcy , cochran & mayor , 1999 ) .",
    "although many uncertainties remain about planet formation , it is now commonly accepted that planets have formed in and from protoplanetary discs .",
    "necessarily , there must be some time interval over which a giant planet and the surrounding gaseous disc material coexist .",
    "the planet and the disc exchange angular momentum through tidal interactions which generally make the planet lose angular momentum this mechanism is called migration .",
    "it can roughly be divided in two regimes :    * if the planet mass is small enough , the disc response is linear .",
    "the migration rate , in that regime , is proportional to the planet and disc masses , is independent of the viscosity and weakly dependent of the disc surface density and temperature profiles .",
    "this is the so - called type  i migration ( ward , 1997 ) .",
    "* when the protoplanet mass is above a certain threshold , the torques acting locally on the surrounding disc material open a gap ( papaloizou & lin , 1984 ) , whose width and depth are controlled by the balance between the tidal torques , which tend to open the gap , and the viscous torques which tend to close it .",
    "the disc response is significantly non - linear , and most of the protoplanet lindblad resonances fall in the gap and therefore can not contribute to the planet - disc angular momentum exchange .",
    "the migration rate slows down dramatically compared to type  i migration .",
    "furthermore , the tidal truncation splits the disc into two parts and the planet is locked to the disc viscous evolution ( nelson et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this is the type  ii migration , which describes the orbital evolution of giant protoplanets .    in this letter",
    "we consider the coupled evolution of a system of giant protoplanets consisting of two non - accreting cores with masses @xmath6  @xmath2  and @xmath7  @xmath2 , which we are going to call from now on respectively `` jupiter '' and `` saturn '' .",
    "attempts have already been made to describe the behaviour of a system of planets embedded in a disc .",
    "melita & woolfson ( 1996 ) and haghighipour ( 1999 ) considered an embedded jupiter and saturn system orbiting a solar mass star , and showed how resonance trapping would affect their evolution .",
    "however the dissipative force in these works was due to the dynamical friction with a uniform density interplanetary medium , hence type  ii migration effects were not taken into account .",
    "resonance trapping of planetesimals by a fixed orbit jupiter sized protoplanet has also been investigated by beaug et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and shown to be able to build up a single planetary core with orbital characteristics close to saturn s ones .",
    "kley ( 2000 ) studied the orbital evolution of two maximally accreting giant cores embedded in a minimal mass protosolar disc , and showed how the migration of the inner core could be halted by the presence of the outer one , and how the eccentricity of the inner core is pumped up by the outer one .",
    "in order to investigate the long - term behaviour of the embedded jupiter and saturn system , we have used two independent hydrocodes , which have been described elsewhere in full detail ( nelson et al .",
    "these two codes are fixed eulerian grid based codes , one of them is nirvana ( ziegler & yorke , 1997 ) and the other one has been written by one of us ( fm ) . both have been endowed with the fast advection fargo algorithm ( masset , 2000 ) , and can run either with this algorithm or with a standard advection algorithm .",
    "they gave very similar results .",
    "they consist of a pure n - body kernel based on either a fourth ( nirvana ) or fifth order adaptative timestep runge - kutta solver ( sufficient for the short time - scales involved in this dissipative problem ) embedded in a hydrocode which provides a tidal interaction with a 2d non self - gravitating gaseous disc .",
    "the simulations are performed in the non - inertial non - rotating frame centered on the primary .",
    "the grid outer boundary does not allow inflow nor outflow and is chosen sufficiently far from the planets in order for the spiral density waves that they launch to be damped before they reach it , while the grid inner boundary only allows outflow ( inwards ) , so that the disc material can be accreted on to the primary . failing to do so may lead to overestimate the inner disc density and artificially favours an outwards migration . in the following our length unit is @xmath8  au",
    ", the mass unit is one solar mass , and the time unit is the initial orbital period of jupiter ( the actual period may vary as jupiter migrates ) .",
    "the disc aspect ratio @xmath9 is uniform and constant . in the run presented here the grid resolution adopted",
    "is @xmath10 and @xmath11 with a geometric spacing of the interzone radii   such that all the zones are `` as square as possible '' , i.e. @xmath12  . the grid outer boundary is at @xmath13 and its inner boundary is at @xmath14 .",
    "the geometric spacing is the most natural one since the disc thickness scales as @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "a constant spacing leads to an oversampling of the outer disc and an undersampling of the inner one , and therefore is likely to favour an inwards migration .",
    "the cores we consider are embedded in a gaseous minimal mass protosolar nebula around a unit mass central object , and we assume they start their evolution with semi - major axis @xmath16 for jupiter and @xmath17 for saturn .",
    "the disc surface density is uniform and corresponds to two jupiter masses inside jupiter s orbit .",
    "the effective viscosity @xmath18 , the nature of which remains unclear and is usually thought to be due to turbulence generated by mhd instabilities ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) , is assumed to be uniform through the disc and corresponds to a value of @xmath19 in the vicinity of jupiter s orbit .",
    "the disc aspect ratio is @xmath20 .",
    "the mass of jupiter is sufficient to open a deep gap and hence it settles in a type ii migration ( nelson et al .",
    "2000 ) , whereas saturn is unable to fully empty its coorbital region because : ( i ) its mass is smaller ; ( ii ) the planet is in a regime known as the inertial limit ( ward & hourigan , 1989 ) where the inwards migration speed is so high that it makes the planet pass through what would be the gap inner edge before it had time to actually open it",
    ".    therefore saturn does not clear a deep gap initially , and its migration rate is typical of type  i migration , since all its lindblad resonances can still contribute to the angular momentum exchange with the disc .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : mig ] the central star ",
    "planet distance curves as a function of time .",
    "we see how initially jupiter migrates as if it was the only planet in the disc ( see test run ) . in the meantime , saturn starts a much faster migration ( the obvious initial acceleration of its migration will be discussed elsewhere ) , and reaches the 1:2 resonance with jupiter at time @xmath21 .",
    "the eccentricities at that time are small ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ecc ] ) , and in particular saturn s eccentricity is much smaller than the eccentricity threshold below which the capture into resonance is certain if the `` adiabatic '' condition on the migration rate is satisfied ( malhotra 1993 ) : @xmath22 for the @xmath23:@xmath24 resonance , where @xmath25 is the mass ratio of jupiter to the central object , and where @xmath26 is saturn s eccentricity .",
    "this condition is not satisfied when saturn reaches the 1:2 resonance , and it passes through .",
    "the planets then obtain higher eccentricities , and saturn s migration rate is reduced .",
    "saturn s eccentricity increases again rapidly as it passes through the 3:5 resonance with jupiter at @xmath27 .",
    "eventually the adiabatic condition on the migration rate is satisfied for the 2:3 resonance and saturn s eccentricity is still below the corresponding critical threshold , so it gets trapped into the 2:3 resonance with jupiter ( both @xmath28 and @xmath29 resonances , since the two critical angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 librate , where @xmath32 is the mean longitude and @xmath33 the longitude of perihelion ) . at that time",
    "both planets steadily migrate outwards .",
    "we define the system of interest as the system composed of the two planets .",
    "this resonance locked system interacts with the inner disc through torques proportional to @xmath34 , at jupiter s inner lindblad resonances ( ilr ) , whereas it interacts with the outer disc through torques proportional to @xmath35 at saturn s outer lindblad resonances ( olr ) , as indicated on fig .",
    "[ fig : lr ] .",
    "it can be seen that saturn s ilr fall in jupiter s gap and jupiter s olr fall in saturn s gap so their effect is weakened compared to the situation where jupiter is alone . as @xmath36 , the torque imbalance does not favour an inwards migration as strongly as in a one planet case , and may even lead to a positive differential lindblad torque on the two planet system .",
    "actually one can estimate what the maximum mass ratio of the outer planet to the inner one should be to get a migration reversal , if one neglects the inner lindblad torque on the outer planet and the outer lindblad torque on the inner planet .",
    "the inner lindblad torque on the inner planet reads as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a dimensionless coefficient which is a sizable fraction of unity ( ward , 1997 ) , and where @xmath39 is the disc aspect ratio .",
    "there is a similar formula for the outer lindblad torque on the outer planet ( obtained by substituting the  @xmath40 and  @xmath41 indices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tin ] ) respectively with  @xmath42 and  @xmath43 ) .",
    "the resulting torque imbalance will be positive if : @xmath44 , which reads here as : @xmath45 if we assume that @xmath46 then we get : @xmath47 , whereas if we make the conservative assumption that @xmath48 , we have : @xmath49 .",
    "this threshold is much bigger than the actual ratio , therefore if the common gap is deep enough to shut off jupiter s olr torques ( and saturn s ilr torques ) then the net lindblad torque on the two planet system is positive .    as the two planet system proceeds outwards in the disc , it does not act on the gas as a snow - plough , but rather it allows the material from the outer disc to travel across the common gap and eventually feed the inner disc .",
    "we can find the gap `` permeability '' condition by requiring that the rate of angular momentum change of the ring of material lying immediately outside saturn s gap that is required to expand accordingly to saturn s orbit ( snow - plough effect ) is greater than the torque available from saturn ( at most the sum of its outer lindblad torques , in which case we need to assume that the waves excited at their olr are damped locally ) . in our case",
    ", this turns out not to be the case and most of the outer disc material flows through the common gap to the inner disc .",
    "we find that in all our runs it is possible to check that the rate of mass flow through the common gap ( see fig .  [ fig : flow ] ) can be expressed as  : @xmath50 with a reasonable precision ( @xmath51   + labelsec : restart runs  which consist in restarting a run once jupiter and saturn are locked into resonance , and then by varying one parameter at one time , e.g. the viscosity or the aspect ratio ( which changes the lindblad torques and therefore the migration rate ) .",
    "the mass flux through the gap rapidly switches ( in a few tens of orbits ) to a new value after the restart , so that eq .  (",
    "[ eq : flux ] ) remains fulfilled .    from the considerations above we",
    "can conclude that the presence of saturn unlocks jupiter from the disc evolution  : the two planet system evolution ( outwards ) and the disc viscous evolution ( inwards ) are basically decoupled .",
    "this decoupling and the corresponding mass flow through the common gap has two consequences  :    * a refilling of the inner disc , which is too depleted for the torques at jupiter s ilr to have any sizable effect in the one planet case ( the inner disc is accreted on the primary on its short viscous time - scale and maintaining its surface density at not too low a value implies a permanent flow of material from the outer disc to the inner ) . * the angular momentum lost by the material which flows from the outer disc to the inner one",
    "is gained by the planets .",
    "the exchange of angular momentum between a planet and a gas fluid element occurs during a `` close encounter '' between these two , the one planet version of which corresponds to the angular momentum exchange at each end of a horseshoe orbit of the fluid element .",
    "the resulting torque is the so - called coorbital corotation torque ( goldreich & tremaine 1979 , ward 1991 and 1992 ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "an analytical evaluation of the corotation torque in the case of a non - vanishing net mass flow through the orbit ( either due to a viscous accretion on to the primary or to a radial migration or both ) has not been performed yet .",
    "obviously even the one planet case deserves a large amount of work on this specific topic , therefore the estimate of the corotation torque in this two planet problem is far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we will just comment that the corotation torque in our case might not be negligible compared to the differential lindblad torque at some stage .",
    "we have performed a series of restart runs ( see section  [ sec : restart ] ) in order to check for a variety of behaviours .",
    "the one sided lindblad torque has been shown to be proportional to @xmath52 ( ward 1997 ) .",
    "we have performed two restart runs ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) in order to check that the migration rate variation is consistent with this dependence .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "we note in passing that the migration rate varies as @xmath52 , and not as @xmath55 as it would be the case in a one planet problem , since the outer / inner lindblad torque asymmetry does not vanish as the disk thickness tends to zero ( the olrs would pile - up at saturn s orbit , whereas the ilrs would pile - up at jupiter s orbit ) .",
    "these results confirm that the behaviour we observe occurs mainly due to the differential lindblad torque and shows as well that this latter quantity is positive , as expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : raplim ] ) .",
    "so far we have only considered a uniform viscosity .",
    "switching to a uniform-@xmath56 viscosity of the form @xmath57 makes @xmath18 scale here as @xmath58 , so the viscosity at the outer edge of the common gap is higher , whereas it is smaller in the inner disc .",
    "this has the following effect , which plays in favour of enhancing the migration reversal mechanism : the viscous time - scale of the inner disc is higher and therefore its surface density increases accordingly , since the material brought through the gap piles - up in the inner disc for a longer time before being accreted on the primary .",
    "this has been checked with a restart run .",
    "the cores considered above do not accrete gas from the disc .",
    "one can wonder what would be the effects of accretion .",
    "we have performed a number of restart runs in order to investigate the effect of accretion on the mechanism presented here .",
    "we have only considered accretion on to jupiter , as it is likely that the accretion rate on saturn can be regarded as being negligible ( i.e. its mass doubling time is much longer than the timescale of the outwards migration , see e.g. pollack et al .",
    "the prescription we used to model accretion on to jupiter consists in removing a proportion of the material which lies in the inner roche lobe ( i.e. a sphere with a radius of half the hill radius ) .",
    "the amount which is removed in one timestep is calculated from the half emptying time of the inner roche lobe @xmath59 .",
    "we have performed four different restart runs , corresponding to the following values of @xmath59 : @xmath60 ( maximally accreting core , see kley 1999 ) , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is jupiter s orbital time . in each of these cases , turning on accretion had no impact on the system migration rate , at least in the early stages : in the first case , the mass doubling time for jupiter is relatively short , and when jupiter s mass is significantly larger than its initial mass some additional effects , which will be presented in much greater detail elsewhere , affect the migration rate which then differ from the non - accreting case .      the smoothing parameter of the potential can have a dramatic impact on saturn s initial migration rate .",
    "this rate is controlled by a subtle balance between outer disc and inner disc torques . in the case of saturn ,",
    "all the lindblad resonances play a role , since there is no gap .",
    "many prescriptions for the smoothing are unable to give trustworthy results for the balance between the outer and inner torques since , depending on the prescription , these two quantities are affected in a different way . on the other hand jupiter s migration rate",
    "is much more robust , since the presence of the gap prevents high-@xmath65 lindblad resonances playing a role in the migration , which is therefore controlled only by remote , low @xmath65 resonances and thus almost insensitive to the smoothing parameter .",
    "for this reason we have adopted an approach which involves choosing a smoothing prescription which endows saturn with a migration velocity of the order of magnitude of the linear analytical predictions ( type  i migration ) , which is needed to give correct results for the capture into resonance .",
    "once saturn is trapped into resonance with jupiter , it is dynamically slaved by the latter and the system evolution is only very weakly affected by the exact value of the outer disc torque exerted on saturn .",
    "we have found that using either of the two prescriptions below satisfactorily preserves the analytical torque imbalance on saturn and therefore gives it a type  i migration rate :    * the potential of a planet acting on the disc is smoothed over the length @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the hill radius of the planet under consideration , whereas the potential of the disc acting back on the planet is smoothed over @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are respectively the local disc thickness and zone diagonal . since @xmath71 the action - reaction law is not fulfilled and the numerical biases which arise favour an inwards migration , as can be easily checked .",
    "* the potential of a planet acting on the disc and the potential of the disc acting on the same planet are smoothed over @xmath72 .",
    "this prescription does fulfill the action - reaction law .",
    "in both these two cases , as in any other which gives saturn a type  i migration rate , including runs performed with a uniform radial spacing , the migration gets reversed .",
    "the run presented here corresponds to the first prescription .",
    "one can wonder about the size of the interval of `` saturn '' s mass which causes the migration to be significantly slowed down or reversed .",
    "if `` saturn '' is not massive enough it will not significantly affect jupiter s evolution ( the common `` gap '' will be too full on saturn s side , and therefore jupiter s olr torques will not be shut off ) , whereas if it is too massive , the torque imbalance will be negative again .",
    "work is in progress to accurately determine which range of parameters leads to a migration reversal .",
    "it should be noted that the results presented here depend on the artificial initial conditions .",
    "we have performed other runs in which saturn is initially very close either to the @xmath73 or @xmath74 resonance , and it turns out that neither of these resonances is able to struggle against the strong lindblad torques on saturn : no resonance angle can be found which provides a resonant torque on saturn which counteracts the tide .",
    "therefore a trapping into the @xmath75 resonance is the most likely outcome when the system is still embedded in a massive disc , whatever the initial conditions : catching - up of `` saturn '' or _ in - situ _ assembling from smaller , type  i migrating bodies .",
    "the long - term behaviour of the system is twofold :    * the system is locked into resonance as long as  : * * the two - planet system can adjust its resonance angle in order to prevent the planets being `` pushed '' towards each other by the lindblad torques exerted by the disk on each of them . in all our runs we have never observed this behaviour .",
    "now , given the small eccentricities involved here , and given the fact that the adiabatic criterion threshold increases as @xmath76 , the most probable outcome is that saturn would then be captured in the next order resonance , that is to say @xmath77 , and all the physics exposed in this paper would still be valid ( presence of a common gap , sharing of the coorbital material by the two planets , mass - weighted torque imbalance , etc . ) * * the planets are not pulled apart by any other torques .",
    "now we have mentioned the possibly important role of the coorbital corotation torque in this problem , which may be sufficient to move the planets apart at some stage , in which case we may ultimately get a low eccentricity double giant planet system when the disc disappears .",
    "this will be presented in greater detail elsewhere . *",
    "if the planets happen to be locked into resonance at the time that the gas effects become negligible , then the system is likely to be unstable ( we mentioned already that at least two angles librate simultaneously , which strongly suggests a possible chaotic behaviour ; see also kley 2000 ) , and the most likely outcome is that one planet will be ejected whereas the other planet will end up on an eccentric orbit .",
    "this could account for the observed eccentricities of the extrasolar planets which are not orbiting close to their host star , i.e. which have not migrated all the way to the star .",
