    "the random phase sine - gordon model plays a role in understanding a variety of phenomena .",
    "the model has been physically interpreted in terms of roughening of crystalline surfaces @xcite , pinning of flux lines in superconducting film @xcite charge density waves @xcite , and other systems .",
    "the model has generated a variety of theoretical predictions @xcite , not all in agreement , and continues to be a scene of activity @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite might be expected to play a decisive role in this situation , but this has not in fact been the case . over the past few years , some of the differences between simulations and",
    "theory have been resolved as a result of better simulations and analysis @xcite and corrections to the precise values of theoretical predictions @xcite , but there still remain discrepancies .    the primary discrepancy between theory and simulation concerns the presence of a @xmath0 component of the spatial propagator computed at distance @xmath1 in the _ high _ temperature phase ( since the high temperature phase is gaussian , the spatial correlator should be simply @xmath2 ) . in the renormalisation group ( rg )",
    "approach , this component is expected below the critical temperature at length scales beyond a characteristic length that diverges as the critical temperature is approached from below . however , in finite lattice simulations , this component is observed @xcite above the expected critical temperature , depending on the strength of the disorder , and leads to uncertainty in actually identifying the location of the critical point  @xcite .",
    "although the possibility that the critical temperature could depend on the strength of the disorder was raised in theoretical work  @xcite , the accepted theoretical view is that this does not occur .",
    "the reason for this is a symmetry of the hamiltonian , noted by cardy and ostlund  @xcite and recognised as a particular example of the so - called statistical tilt symmetry @xcite .",
    "another discrepancy concerns the strength of the @xmath0 component in the _ low _ temperature phase .",
    "the rg prediction for this strength turns out to be universal , yet it does not match the value observed in simulations on achievable lattice sizes .",
    "figure ( [ fig : old ] ) illustrates the discrepancies between the infinite volume rg prediction and data from simulations of several years ago  @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have been observed in other numerical studies  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use perturbative rg arguments to estimate the size of the @xmath0 component for small couplings in the vicinity of the critical temperature bearing in mind the finite size of the lattices used in simulation .",
    "we confront these estimates with data from new high precision simulations made within the restricted parameter range where perturbation theory can be relied upon .",
    "our estimates _ do _ display a @xmath3 behaviour above the critical temperature and match the strength below the critical temperature therefore resolving the discrepancy .    to use the rg theory to make predictions on the lattice , we need to compute the coefficients appearing in the rg equations using a lattice regulator .",
    "the usual treatment is via a coulomb gas @xcite which involves a completely different type of regulator .",
    "we have obtained rg coefficients for the lattice regulator by adapting kogut s original approach of momentum shell integration  @xcite .",
    "these coefficients are substantially smaller than the conventional coulomb gas ones , and allow quantitative agreement with the simulation data .",
    "nonetheless , the rg theory is only valid for small couplings , and only in this region do we obtain good agreement .",
    "we commence with a description of the model and simulation data we wish to explain but relegate technical details of numerical work to appendix a. then in section iii , we briefly review the rg for this model and refer to appendix b for the full computation of rg coefficients appropriate to the lattice regulator .",
    "section iv discusses our technique for estimating the finite size correlator and presents results in the form of a figure confronting the prediction against the new simulation data .",
    "the conclusion critically discusses our treatment and since this work does not constitute a full finite size theory , it also discusses some of the issues involved in such a theory .",
    "the random phase sine - gordon model has hamiltonian , @xmath4 depending on the physical system , the continuous field @xmath5 may be interpreted in different ways . in the case of a surface , @xmath5 is the height of the interface so the field @xmath5 is not periodic and vortices are excluded .",
    "the disorder is contained in the term @xmath6 which is characterised by some probability distribution . usually a flat distribution for the quenched disorder in @xmath7 , is assumed , but other distributions have also been simulated  @xcite .    in order to clarify the problems that arise in simulations , let us start by recalling the results of our earlier numerical study @xcite of this model which form the basis of figure ( [ fig : old ] ) .",
    "signals of a transition were clear in both the static and dynamic properties .",
    "have been measured @xcite . ] although the static correlation function had the expected @xmath2 behaviour for high temperature , it was clear that another component was present at low temperatures .",
    "the results were not sufficiently sensitive to determine the functional form of this additional component , but a @xmath0 term as predicted by the rg studies allowed a good fit to the data . to be precise",
    ", the simulated spatial correlator was fitted with the function ( using @xmath8 to denote average over the thermal noise and @xmath9 as the average over the quenched disorder ) : @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fit parameters and @xmath13 is the gaussian correlator on a lattice of size @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the symbol @xmath16 holds for large lattices , @xmath17 and length scales , @xmath1 , that are large but not approaching @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath18 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "this is actually the correlator along a lattice axis and is the appropriate quantity to compare with the correlators obtained from simulation .",
    "instead of relying on our old data to make comparison with our predictions we have performed new high precision simulations .",
    "these new simulations at small coupling , @xmath19 , remain on the same @xmath20 lattice but have better thermalization , an improved random number generator and higher statistics .",
    "details of the simulations and comparison with the old data are discussed in appendix a along with additional data exploring other values of @xmath21 .",
    "data for the coefficient @xmath12 of the @xmath0 term based on new simulations are presented in figure ( [ fig : new ] ) later in the paper .",
    "a convenient basis for the rg studies is the continuum replicated version of the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) following cardy and ostlund  @xcite : @xmath22 greek letters denote the @xmath23 replica indices and we have made @xmath24 dimensionless by explicitly writing the uv cutoff @xmath25 .",
    "the kinetic term of the replicated hamiltonian is parameterised with separate coefficients for the on and off - diagonal pieces , @xmath26 , since the off - diagonal piece appears after renormalisation even if not present initially .",
    "the bare hamiltonian only has a diagonal term , so the bare parameters are : @xmath27 .",
    "the bare value of @xmath24 is related to the parameters of the simulated hamiltonian by : @xmath28 .",
    "rg equations may be obtained from ( [ eq : reph ] ) @xcite , though the same results are obtained without replicas @xcite . in either case",
    "an additional term is generated : in the replica calculation it appears as the off - diagonal part of @xmath29 , whereas in the other approach it appears as the coefficient of a new term in the hamiltonian , linear in the derivative of @xmath5 .",
    "these same equations have been derived in a variety of ways ; a coulomb gas approach @xcite , conventional field theory @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite , with the help of the exact renormalisation group @xcite and in appendix a , we ourselves use momentum shell integration .",
    "irrespective of the method of derivation , the parameters change with the rg scale , @xmath30 , in the following way : @xmath31 where the reduced temperature @xmath32 .",
    "the critical temperature is at @xmath33 ( hence , @xmath34 ) .",
    "these perturbative rg equations have been obtained in a double expansion : small coupling @xmath24 and small reduced temperature @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "they are valid for small couplings in the region near the critical point where higher order terms can be ignored .",
    "the asymptotic form as @xmath36 of the solution of these equations depends on the phase . in the high temperature region where @xmath35 is negative , the fixed point value of @xmath37 is zero and @xmath38 goes to a constant . in the low temperature region @xmath37",
    "becomes @xmath39 , and the coupling @xmath38 behaves as @xmath40 .",
    "the consequences of these solutions are fully explored in the literature and we do not repeat the analysis here .",
    "the rg coefficients @xmath41 are dimensionless , non - universal constants of order unity .",
    "they depend on the temperature but various workers  @xcite noted that the amplitude ratio @xmath42 appearing in the asymptotic form of @xmath38 below @xmath43 , is universal at the critical point .",
    "the correct value for this ratio was clarified by carpentier and le doussal @xcite ( see also reference  @xcite ) . in our conventions",
    "( note that we keep a factor of @xmath44 inside the cosine term ) , this ratio is : @xmath45 @xmath46 is the universal ratio defined in @xcite and carefully shown to take the value @xmath47 .",
    "the non - universal values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 themselves are necessary to compare with simulation .",
    "the regulator natural in the coulomb gas approach used by cardy and ostlund  @xcite gives values @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these values are rather high and we should properly use values from a lattice regulator .",
    "a full perturbative rg computation on the lattice becomes difficult so we have resorted to the following argument .",
    "we have used momentum shell integration following kogut @xcite to rederive the rg equations .",
    "this technique needs a modification first pointed out in @xcite to take account of the correct operator product expansion , however all computations can be consistently expressed in terms of gaussian integrals without any need to be concerned with the subtleties of two dimensional massless canonical field theory .",
    "details are given in appendix b , and this technique yields an expression in terms of the gaussian propagator @xmath52 : @xmath53 } = 4\\pi e^{\\phi(\\infty)}\\,.\\ ] ] the final expression on the right is evaluated at the critical point , is identical that obtained by a different procedure in @xcite and gives the correct value of the universal ratio .",
    "@xmath54 depends on the regulation scheme and is defined in terms of the subtracted propagator : @xmath55   = - { 1\\over 2\\pi } \\log ( r\\lambda ) + { 1\\over 4\\pi } \\phi(r\\lambda ) \\,.\\ ] ] the momentum shell integration technique requires a regulator that is sufficiently smooth to make the term @xmath56 short range and thus render the expression for @xmath49 well defined .",
    "the lattice propagator has this property , and we can identify @xmath57 using the asymptotic form of the lattice regulator ( [ eq : psubl ] )  @xcite :    @xmath55_\\mathrm{lattice }   \\rightarrow - { 1\\over 2\\pi } \\log ( r\\lambda 2\\sqrt{2}e^{\\gamma_e})\\,.\\ ] ]    we therefore use the value of @xmath49 given by @xmath58 recalling the value of the euler - mascheroni constant @xmath59 , we find this value of @xmath49 to be substantially smaller than the coulomb gas value .",
    "in order to compare the rg theory with simulation , we need the correlation function on a finite geometry .",
    "the usual derivation of the rg correlator in infinite volume was given by toner and vicenzo  @xcite and we shall proceed in a similar way _ without _ taking asymptotic values for the rg scale . numerically it is better to work in the real space , but the fields @xmath5 do not transform simply under the rg , so we consider the composite fields @xmath60 that have better properties  @xcite .",
    "general rg arguments allow us to write an equation for the correlation function @xmath61 of these vertex operators ( see for example reference  @xcite ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is twice the ( rg ) dimension of the vertex operator @xmath64 .",
    "the leading terms in the perturbative expansion of this quantity are : @xmath65 determining the value of @xmath66 , twice the anomalous dimension , in our rg scheme is not straightforward ( it requires the ope of three vertex operators ) and neither has it been computed in other renormalisation schemes .",
    "we have therefore only kept the leading term in @xmath67 when expanding equation ( [ rg_eq ] ) in @xmath68 .",
    "we expand to order @xmath69 and write @xmath70 , to obtain an rg equation for @xmath71 : @xmath72 this expression amounts to using the zeroth order formulae improved with the running coupling constants computed to second order in perturbation theory and is the same procedure usually followed .",
    "we will show that this approximation provides us with the same qualitative picture obtained in numerical simulations and a good agreement with the numerical data obtained at small coupling constant .",
    "besides omitting the order @xmath73 term from the renormalisation factor @xmath67 , we have consistently terminated the perturbative expansion of @xmath74 at zeroth order .",
    "in fact we have obtained an expression for the order @xmath73 contribution to @xmath74 , but the resulting formula is not amenable to numerical calculation on suitable size lattices  .",
    "we remark that even if we were able to include these order @xmath73 terms , it would only be a step towards greater precision since the complete model on the lattice also requires irrelevant operators ( see appendix c ) .    on the lattice",
    "we replace @xmath2 by its lattice version equation ( [ eq : psubl ] ) , @xmath75 , so our final equation for the correlator is : @xmath76\\right)}{\\tilde k}\\right ) p_l(1 )   + 2 \\int^{2 \\pi ( p_l(r)-p_l(1))}_0 dl \\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\tilde",
    "k }    \\left(2-\\frac{k(l)}{\\tilde k } \\right ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : rgcorrrsf}\\ ] ]    as is the case for the momentum space version , this equation depends on the running coupling @xmath38 and consequently the behaviour of the correlator depends on the phase . the standard , infinite volume ,",
    "analysis is based on using the asymptotic solution for @xmath38 . in the high temperature phase where @xmath77 is constant",
    "this yields a @xmath2 correlator with the correct coefficient ( @xmath78 ) even at temperatures beyond the region of validity of the perturbative result . at low temperature",
    "the asymptotic solution @xmath79 leads to the @xmath3 behaviour  @xcite .",
    "@xmath80 this leading term has universal coefficient , which takes a value @xmath81 ( see equation ( [ fitform ] ) ) . the sub - leading @xmath2 term , ( the dots in the equation above ) can be obtained from corrections to the asymptotic value of @xmath38 , though its precise value is dependent on the regulation scheme . comparison of the two terms yields a length scale that separates the @xmath2 from the @xmath3 behaviour .",
    "since the coefficient of the @xmath82 does not have any @xmath35 factor , this crossover scale diverges as @xmath83 as @xmath43 is approached from below .",
    "this is the problem identified in the introduction .    to make predictions for finite size",
    ", we use the full solution of the rg equation for @xmath38  @xcite : @xmath84 where the parameter @xmath85 has the same sign as @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath86 , is universal , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this is an exact solution of the perturbative rg equations valid in the region of small @xmath37 , namely for small @xmath21 near the transition . by using this expression and numerically solving the real space rg equation",
    "( i.e. computing numerically the integral which appears in the right of equation ( [ eq : rgcorrrsf ] ) ) , we are able to compute the finite size lattice correlator @xmath71 . the resulting correlator could be compared directly against simulation data for this quantity , but it is clearer to present the comparison in the same way as we did in our earlier work by fitting the predicted correlator with a form ( [ fitform ] ) .    to put this program in practice",
    "we use the value of @xmath87 that we argued was appropriate for lattice regulation , and we make the fit to the finite size correlator over the range @xmath88 since both our original and new simulations are on a @xmath20 lattice .",
    "the resulting predictions are shown in figure ( [ fig : predict ] ) .",
    "these predictions have the same qualitative form as the simulation data shown in figure ( [ fig : old ] ) .",
    "namely , we observe the same apparent shift in critical temperature with @xmath21 or appearance of @xmath89 above @xmath43 and the same dependence of this shift , which increases with increasing @xmath21 .    for a more precise test of agreement , figure ( [ fig : new ] )",
    "expands the previous figure near the critical temperature to confront the new high precision @xmath19 data against the predictions .",
    "the features identified in the introduction are clearly apparent in the data in figure ( [ fig : new ] ) : the continued presence of the @xmath0 coefficient above the expected @xmath90 , and the disagreement with the _ universal _ infinite volume prediction for this coefficient below @xmath43 .",
    "the similarity between the finite size prediction and data is striking . within the temperature range shown ,",
    "the predictions lie within twice the error bound of the simulations .",
    "we can quantify the extent of agreement by computing @xmath91 between the numerical data and our theoretical prediction .",
    "we obtain @xmath92 using the temperatures in the interval @xmath93 $ ] , the number of degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) being 5 ( notice that we fit the numerical data to a function that we have obtained without resort to these data ) .",
    "the probability to have a @xmath91 larger than @xmath92 for 5 d.o.f .",
    "is 40% , which is larger than the 5% limit typically used in the literature to discriminate the validity of hypotheses @xcite .",
    "if the interval is enlarged further below the critical temperature to @xmath94 $ ] we obtain @xmath95 with 6 d.o.f . corresponding to a probability of 25%  ,",
    "@xmath96 with @xmath97 and for the 6 d.o.f . interval [ 0.45,0.7 ] , @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "the agreement is considerably less significant than with the new data . ]",
    "this agreement can also be seen by directly comparing the prediction for the correlator against the result from simulations . at @xmath100",
    "the agreement is very good , with all predicted points lying well within the small errors of the data .    in appendix",
    "a , by way of motivating our choice of parameters for the new simulations , we discuss some exploratory simulations at higher values of @xmath21 . these suggest that for larger couplings as we move away from the perturbative regime , the agreement will not be so good .",
    "indeed , in figure ( [ fig : old ] ) the @xmath101 and @xmath102 data are not far apart , suggesting that @xmath101 is well into the non - perturbative regime . for these reasons we did not perform any further new simulations .",
    "nonetheless , the predictions in figure ( [ fig : predict ] ) retain the qualitative features observed in the original simulations , figure ( [ fig : old ] ) .    although our simulations were only at a particular lattice size ,",
    "it is illuminating to consider how the results of the procedure above depend on the lattice size .",
    "we find that above @xmath43 , as the size is increased , the coefficient @xmath12 decreases , but the dependence is extremely weak as was found in numerical simulations ( in references @xcite , @xmath103 and @xmath104 lattices yielded @xmath12 curves with overlapping error bars in the low temperature phase ) . by following our finite size procedure for a range of lattice",
    "sizes up to 512 , we find a good fit to a scaling form . at @xmath105",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 goes to zero according to @xmath106 for both @xmath19 and 1.0 .",
    "this exponent takes a value close to @xmath107 since at this temperature @xmath108 .",
    "this result corresponds to a finite size dependence @xmath109 , that might be expected since @xmath24 enters the rg equation for @xmath110 as @xmath73 .",
    "our main result lies in the similarity shown in figure ( [ fig : new ] ) between new simulations and the predictions based on the rg estimate according to our finite size treatment . until now , the numerical simulation results have been a puzzle since it appears that either there is a @xmath0 component to the correlator above the critical temperature , or that the location of the critical temperature depends on the disorder",
    ". neither of these interpretations are consistent with the conventional rg treatment . in this paper",
    "we have shown that one can qualitatively understand the numerical observations in the framework of the rg without the need for any additional ingredient just by taking account of strong finite size effects . above and near the critical temperature ,",
    "the disorder strength renormalises to zero and the fixed point is gaussian . however",
    "the dependence on lattice size is extremely slow , and this behaviour induces the @xmath0 term above the critical temperature .",
    "the statistically significant level of agreement relies on several factors .",
    "firstly , the use of new high precision numerical simulations that are better thermalized than the old data .",
    "secondly , the agreement only occurs in the regime where perturbative rg is valid , namely for small disorder strength ( @xmath111 ) and near the transition @xmath112 .",
    "finally the level of quantitative agreement is crucially dependent on the use of rg coefficients appropriate to the lattice regulator rather than the traditional coulomb gas values .",
    "our treatment does not constitute a full finite size theory , and there are several factors we have neglected .",
    "the first of these is the perturbative correction from @xmath37 to the equation ( [ eqcorrg2 ] ) .",
    "although the leading perturbative contributions to the correlator can be written down , their numerical evaluation would require additional approximations that would undermine attempts to make detailed quantitative comparisons .",
    "moreover , the renormalisation factor from the anomalous dimension of the vertex operator has not been computed .",
    "a proper treatment of these perturbative corrections would require a full lattice based perturbative computation .",
    "another factor is the contribution from irrelevant operators .",
    "irrelevant operators can arise from the higher cosine modes after integrating out the disorder and also from the discretisation . a brief discussion of these operators is given in appendix c. a final factor , the use of an rg coefficient appropriate to the lattice regulator has been included in our treatment , and",
    "indeed without this we would not achieve anything like the quantitative agreement shown in figure ( [ fig : new ] ) .    in our earlier numerical work",
    "@xcite we also investigated the dynamics .",
    "we found that the dynamical critical exponent @xmath113 departs from its gaussian value above the critical temperature , and that the value of this term depends on the disorder strength ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "we expect that this effect can also be explained in terms of the same strong finite size effects .",

    "we thank a. garca for providing computing support .",
    "here we discuss technical details of both the old and new simulations and present additional numerical results .",
    "all the data under discussion has been placed in the journal repository .      our original numerical simulations  @xcite were performed in 1995 on an ape supercomputer .",
    "working on a @xmath20 lattice , two values of the coupling were considered , @xmath114 and @xmath115 and 128 samples were used for each data point .",
    "figure ( [ fig : old ] ) also shows results for the discrete model  @xcite , but in view of the large coupling this model corresponds to , we do not consider it in the present work .",
    "the data were based on a single annealing run ( henceforth called dataset a ) , with @xmath116 thermalization and @xmath117 measurement sweeps at each temperature ( separated by @xmath118 ) . the random number generator used in this work  @xcite",
    "has since been criticised  @xcite .      to reduce the size of the error bars on dataset a so as to make quantitative comparisons we performed a number of high precision simulations around the transition temperature .",
    "since the ape machine used for the original simulations is no longer available , we wrote new code running on xeon pc s .",
    "these new simulations remain on the same @xmath20 lattice but have better thermalization , higher statistics and an improved random number generator ( a 64-bit congruential generator based on reference  @xcite ) .",
    "both dataset b and c are at @xmath19 .",
    "dataset b checks the new code by using the same parameters and the original annealing schedule of dataset a and closely reproduces those results .",
    "error bars generally overlap , though they are slightly apart at t=0.65,0.7 .",
    "a @xmath91 evaluation gives a confidence limit of 15% that the data arise from the same distribution .",
    "the new data ( b ) tends to give slightly higher signal than the old data ( a ) and we would ascribe this difference , if significant , to the improved random number generator .",
    "we therefore have confidence in the new code .    for improved thermalization , dataset c ,",
    "the annealing schedule has been lengthened and consists of separate runs of 500 samples with @xmath119 thermalization sweeps at temperature intervals of @xmath120 .",
    "the final measurements are then taken over @xmath119 sweeps . each data - point ( c ) lies within two sigma of the other data , however , there is a systematic effect that always increases the new value of @xmath12 relative to either a or b. thermalization is the main factor in the difference , but we can not discount an effect also from the random number generator .",
    "we have also performed runs to observe the approach to thermalization at @xmath121 by tracking the value of the correlator at maximum distance ( 32 , half the lattice size ) , as the measurements progress .",
    "this study indicates that a thermalization of @xmath119 sweeps is necessary and sufficient ( to an accuracy corresponding to the number of samples we use ) .",
    "we are therefore confident in the new data c and this is what we use in the main text to make quantitative comparisons with the rg predictions .      before deciding the coupling strength to use for run c",

    "in this appendix we use momentum shell integration technique to derive expressions for the rg coefficients that can be used with a lattice regulator .",
    "although we end up with formulae equivalent to those obtained using other methods in  @xcite , it is only by going through the full derivation that we are able to check that the expressions remain valid with a lattice regulator . the momentum shell technique is direct and intuitive and is an interesting calculation in its own right .",
    "the technique is explained by kogut for the quite similar ( ordered ) sine - gordon model in @xcite .",
    "since we follow this reference quite closely , in this appendix we only give an outline of the computation with particular details of differences from the ordered sine - gordon case .",
