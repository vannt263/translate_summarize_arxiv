    "the former case applies rather well to narrow lorentzian profiles ( small width , @xmath73 , typical of galactic halos ) while the latter fits correctly the central regions of the constant and gaussian density profiles .",
    "this last case corresponds to the best amplification we can hope for since the signal crossing the central region is focused .",

    "this means that the    sun can not focus on the earth a neutrino beam coming from a far    source .",
    "the required intersection happens nevertheless at distances    around 20 au , meaning that uranians could perform neutrino lensing    experiments using the sun as a lens ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for them ,    any neutrino source would be amplified in turn as the sun sweeps in    front of it !",

    "@xmath79    eq .  ( [ ampliinf ] ) shows that in order to achieve an amplification    factor greater than 2 , @xmath80 must be in the range    ( 0.31.7)@xmath74 . outside this interval",

    "the case is thus similar to that of photons ,    namely the lens focuses a thin ring whose radius is the einstein    radius . according to eq .",
    "( [ magniresults ] ) , a typical magnification    factor for stars would be ( assuming    @xmath77 )    @xmath82 where    @xmath83 is the physical radius of the source .",
    "even if    huge amplifications are possible , we have verified that for expected    neutrino sources this signal enhancement is insufficient to allow the    detection , the reason being that the magnification can not compensate    the @xmath84 geometrical suppression of the    signal .",
    "+    we shall now discuss the case of binary systems @xcite , where one    star acts as a source and the other , very close to the first one , acts    as a lens .",
    "binary systems satisfy    @xmath85 and    @xmath86 .",
    "the most interesting behaviour    occurs when the source is located at the effective focal length    dictated by the central region of the lens ; the image is then a full    disk .",
    "this coincidence happens for @xmath87 where    @xmath88 in the central region of a gaussian    profile and the width is set at @xmath12 .",

    "an upper estimate of the total magnification is given    by ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) @xmath89 where    @xmath71 is the angular size of the disk image .",
    "the source should then be at least one order of magnitude smaller in    radius than the lens in order to provide a large magnification .",
    "binary    stars will seldom meet all the above requisites but for more exotic    systems , with a compact and intense neutrino source , this situation is    really promising . in some way ,",
    "the large companion acts as the lens    focusing a lighthouse beam .",
    "_ galaxies : _ : :    lastly , we shall discuss another class of lens candidates , namely    galaxies or rather galactic halos . in fig .",
    "[ plotalldeflectnor ] , it is    shown that the maximum deflection angle for a lorentzian density    profile is close to @xmath90 and , more precisely , is always    smaller than @xmath91 ( independently of the value    taken for @xmath11 ) .",
    "so , in order to focus on earth , an    effective focal length of @xmath92 is needed .",

    "unlike photons , which are absorbed by dust clouds , neutrinos survive    in their travel through the galaxy because the probability of meeting    a star is tiny . for calculating the signal enhancement we use the    lorentzian density profile . in this case , however , the precise value    of the width @xmath11 is not known , although it has to be    small enough to explain the velocity dispersion curves inside    galaxies . assuming @xmath11 is small we calculate the    magnification for @xmath93 ( this time the image is a ring ) :    @xmath94 as in the case of    binary systems , a small neutrino source is required for non - negligible    signal enhancement .",
