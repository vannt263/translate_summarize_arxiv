    "searching for the higgs boson is one of the most important tasks in particle physics .",
    "the existence of a relatively light higgs is suggested by high precision fits to the data in the standard model ( sm ) and also is theoretically favored in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite .",
    "verification of the existence of a light higgs boson at the lhc or tevatron is therefore a very important test for both the sm and the mssm . among the various production channels for a light higgs boson at the hadron colliders",
    ", the production in association with a bottom quark pair , @xmath1 , plays an important role in testing the bottom quark yukawa couplings .",
    "while this process has a small cross section in the sm , in the mssm this production mechanism can be a significant source of higgs bosons since the bottom quark yukawa coupling in the mssm is proportional to @xmath0 ( defined as @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets ) and the current analyses favor large @xmath0 .",
    "this process has been studied at next - to - leading order in perturbative qcd  @xcite . due to the importance of this production mechanism in testing the bottom quark yukawa coupling in the mssm , the supersymmetry ( susy ) loop effects in this process should also be considered . of course , among the susy loop effects the one - loop susy qcd corrections are the dominant .    in the present work",
    "we examine the one - loop susy qcd effects in this process . instead of performing a complete one - loop calculation , which would be quite complicated since it involves many five - point box diagrams , we focus on the so - called susy residual effects , i.e. , the susy effects in the heavy limit ( @xmath4 tev ) of the sparticles involved .",
    "our motivations are the following :    * it is possible that all the sparticles except a light higgs boson are too heavy to be directly produced at the lhc and tevatron , such as in the split susy scenario proposed recently by arkani - hamed and dimopoulos @xcite .",
    "although the fermionic partners ( gauginos and higgsinos ) in this scenario are required to be relatively light in order to ensure gauge coupling unification and provide dark matter candidates , they are not necessarily below a tev , as recently shown @xcite .",
    "thus , it is possible for the lhc and tevatron to observe no sparticles except a light higgs boson . in that case a possible way to reveal a hint of supersymmetry is through its residual effects in observable processes . * unfortunately ( or fortunately ) , susy virtual effects decouple in most processes when susy particles become very heavy .",
    "however , we know that the only processes where susy has residual effects are those processes involving higgs - fermion yukawa couplings , as first studied for @xmath5 decay @xcite , and also for certain production processes @xcite . the production reaction @xmath1 at the lhc or tevatron is well suited for revealing susy residual effects since it involves the @xmath6 coupling . compared with @xmath7 ,",
    "this process is also easier to detect since it contains an extra hard @xmath8 jet in the final state .",
    "once the higgs boson ( @xmath9 ) is observed and its mass is measured through other processes such as gluon - gluon fusion , this reaction can be used to measure the bottom quark yukawa coupling and to observe the expected residual effects of susy .",
    "note that the existence of susy residual effects in some higgs process does not mean susy is not decoupling in low energy processes . as shown in previous studies , and also in the following work ,",
    "the residual effects exist when @xmath10 remains light ; when @xmath10 is heavy , together with all other susy masses , the residual effects do vanish .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : calculation ] we present our strategy for the calculation of the one - loop susy qcd corrections . in section [",
    "sec : results ] we perform numerical calculations and obtain the residual effects in the limit of heavy susy masses .",
    "the conclusion is given in section [ sec : conclusion ] and the detailed analytic formulas obtained in our calculations are presented in the appendix .",
    "the production @xmath11 proceeds through the parton - level processes @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the one - loop susy qcd corrections to this process have a huge number of one - loop diagrams ,",
    "including many five - point box diagrams .",
    "however , among all these diagrams only the one - loop diagrams involving the bottom quark yukawa coupling have residual effects as the susy masses become very heavy . therefore , in our calculation we need only consider the loop corrected bottom quark yukawa coupling diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    in our loop calculations we used dimensional regularization to control the ultraviolet divergences and adopted the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme .",
    "each effective @xmath6 vertex in fig.[fig1 ] contains two parts : one is the irreducible three - point vertex loop contributions and the other is the counterterms @xmath14 with @xmath15 denoting the tree - level @xmath6 coupling and @xmath16 is the renormalization constant given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the renormalization constant for the @xmath8 quark field and mass .",

    "the counterterm is universal for each @xmath6 vertex shown in fig .",
    "however , although the irreducible three - point vertex loops have the same topological structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the results are different for different @xmath6 vertices in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] because they depend on the external momenta .",
    "the results are lengthy and are presented in the appendix .",
    "we have checked that all the ultraviolet divergences do cancel as a result of renormalizability of the mssm .    note",
    "that in our calculations we adopted the so - called on - mass - shell scheme , in which the renormalized mass @xmath27 ( @xmath28 is the bare mass ) is the physical mass , i.e. , the pole of the @xmath8-quark propagator @xcite . the main difference of this scheme with the @xmath29 scheme is that in the @xmath29 scheme a running b - quark mass is introduced to absorb the leading part of the corrections ( for example , the large logarithms in qcd corrections ) @xcite . in calculating susy - qcd corrections",
    ", there are no such large logarithms and the on - mass - shell scheme is usually adopted ( an extensive discussion about this issue was provided in @xcite ) scheme in calculating susy - qcd corrections to the @xmath6 coupling , i.e. , define a running b - quark mass to absorb some susy - qcd correction effects , we will obtain the approximately same result for the ratio of the cross sections with and without susy - qcd corrections ( because by doing this we merely relocated some correction effects and the total one - loop susy - qcd correction effects are not changed ) . ] .    including the one - loop susy - qcd corrections to the bottom quark yukawa coupling",
    ", the renormalized amplitude for @xmath30 can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the tree - level amplitude and one - loop susy - qcd corrections , respectively . the detailed expression for @xmath33",
    "is given in the appendix .    in our calculation",
    "we performed monte carlo integration to obtain the hadronic cross section by using the cteq5l parton distribution functions  @xcite with @xmath34 and requiring the transverse momentum of the two b - jets to be larger than 15 gev .    to exhibit the size of the corrections we define the ratio @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the tree - level cross section .",
    "before performing numerical calculations , we must choose the parameters involved .",
    "for the sm parameters we used @xmath37 gev , @xmath38 gev , @xmath39 gev , @xmath40 gev , @xmath41 , and the two - loop running coupling constant @xmath42 .",
    "for the susy parameters , apart from the charged higgs mass , gluino mass and @xmath0 , the mass parameters of sbottoms are involved . the mass - squared matrix for the sbottoms takes the form  @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 here @xmath45 and @xmath46 are soft - breaking mass terms for the left - handed squark doublet @xmath47 and the right - handed down squark @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 is the coefficient of the trilinear term @xmath50 in the soft - breaking terms and @xmath51 is the bilinear coupling of the two higgs doublets in the superpotential .",

    "i.e. , @xmath64 + in this case the mixing of sbottoms is maximal , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] show the dependence on the susy scale @xmath66 for different values of @xmath0 and @xmath10 .",
    "we see that @xmath67 approaches a non - vanishing constant as @xmath66 becomes large .",
    "the effects are enhanced by @xmath0 . for @xmath68",
    ", the residual effects can be as large as @xmath69 .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows that as @xmath10 becomes large the size of residual effects decrease .",
    "* _ case b :   all susy mass parameters , including @xmath10 , are much larger than the weak scale , _",
    "i.e. , @xmath70 this case also gives maximal mixing for sbottoms . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the dependence on the mssm mass scale @xmath66 .",
    "this figure explicitly exhibits the decoupling behaviour of susy qcd as @xmath66 becomes large .",
    "the underlying reason for the existence of susy residual effects in fermion yukawa couplings when @xmath10 is fixed at the weak scale is that certain couplings are proportional to susy mass parameters @xcite . as pointed out in @xcite , the susy qcd residual effects in the @xmath71 coupling",
    "are proportional to @xmath0 . for @xmath72 coupling , however , the susy qcd residual effects are proportional to @xmath73 . for the process",
    "@xmath74 the calculation of susy qcd corrections is analogous to the @xmath75 case .",
    "however , we found that the susy residual effects in @xmath74 are quite small , reaching only @xmath76 for @xmath77 and being smaller for larger @xmath0 values .",
    "such a small effect is even less than the next - to - leading - order qcd corrections  @xcite and is not likely to be observed at the lhc or tevatron .",
    "note that in our calculations , instead of using the effective @xmath71 vertex @xcite , we performed the complete one - loop calculations for @xmath71 yukawa coupling , which , as pointed out in the paragraph following eq.(4 ) , are dependent on the external momenta of @xmath71 vertex .",
    "we found that when susy mass scale is larger than about 1 tev , using the effective @xmath71 vertex @xcite is a good approximation .    as we pointed out in the introduction , we only considered the one - loop susy qcd corrections , which are the dominant part of the susy corrections .",
    "of course , the susy electroweak corrections to @xmath71 coupling also have residue effects , which , however , are obviously suppressed by a factor @xmath78 relative to the susy qcd effects .",
    "since much more parameters are involved in the susy electroweak sector , we did not perform a detailed calculation for the susy electroweak corrections here .",
    "we examined the supersymmetric qcd effects in bottom pair production associated with a light higgs boson at the lhc and tevatron .",
    "we found that when the relevant sparticles are heavy , well above the tev scale , they nevertheless contribute sizable virtual effects in this process . for large @xmath0 , these residual effects can alter the production cross section by as much as 40 percent and thus should be measurable in observations of this process at the lhc or tevatron .",
    "if only one light higgs boson , or perhaps several higgs bosons , are discovered at the lhc or tevatron , it could indicate that the susy scale is quite high ; above the tev scale .",
    "of course , the fine - tuning problem then remains and supersymmetry loses one of its merits . but this might possibly happen since supersymmetry does not have to solve the fine - tuning problem , as argued recently by arkani - hamed and dimopoulos @xcite . in that case , a possible way to reveal a hint of supersymmetry is through its residue effects .",
    "higgs production associated with a pair of bottom quarks is then well suited for such a seeking a clue for supersymmetry .",

    "<S> if all the supersymmetry particles ( sparticles ) except a light higgs boson are too heavy to be directly produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and tevatron , a possible way to reveal evidence for supersymmetry is through their virtual effects in other processes . </S>",

    "<S> we find that if the relevant sparticles ( gluinos and squarks ) are well above the tev scale , too heavy to be directly produced , they can still have sizable virtual effects in this process . for large @xmath0 , such residual effects can alter the production rate by as much as 40 percent , which should be observable in future measurements of this process .    </S>",
