    "the critical behavior of two - dimensional frustrated spin models with noncollinear or canted order has been the object of intensive theoretical and experimental studies , being of prime interest for those investigating layered magnetic systems with special structures and superconducting josephson - junction arrays in an external magnetic field .    in physical magnets , frustration ( leading to noncollinear order ) may arise either because of the special geometry of the lattice or from the competition of different kinds of interactions .",
    "an example of the first kind is the two - dimensional triangular antiferromagnet , whereas for the latter case typical models are the fully frustrated @xmath5 model on a square lattice and models with different nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor interactions . in these systems",
    "the hamiltonian is minimized by the noncollinear configurations with a 120@xmath6 spin structure . as a consequence , at criticality",
    ", there is a breakdown of o(@xmath0 ) symmetry in the high - temperature phase to o(@xmath7 ) symmetry in the ordered phase .",
    "field - theoretical ( ft ) studies of systems with noncollinear order are based on the o(@xmath0)@xmath8o(@xmath9 ) symmetric landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath10   + { 1\\over 4!}u_0 \\left ( \\sum_a \\phi_a^2\\right)^2 \\right .    \\left . + { 1\\over 4 ! }   v_0   \\sum_{a , b } \\left [ ( \\phi_a \\cdot \\phi_b)^2 - \\phi_a^2\\phi_b^2\\right ]               \\right\\ } ,   \\label{lgwh}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are @xmath9 sets of @xmath0-component vectors .",
    "we will consider the case @xmath13 , that , for @xmath14 , describes frustrated systems with noncollinear ordering .",
    "negative values of @xmath15 correspond to simple ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering , and to magnets with sinusoidal spin structures  @xcite .",
    "the physically relevant cases are described by the hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) with @xmath16 ( frustrated @xmath5 model ) and @xmath17 ( frustrated heisenberg model ) . despite the very intensive theoretical and experimental efforts to fully understand the critical behavior of these models , the situation is still controversial . for the frustrated @xmath5 model",
    "the strongly debated point is either the single critical temperature @xmath18 exists at which both the @xmath19 and the @xmath20 symmetries are simultaneously broken or there are two successive phase transitions at different critical temperatures . in the latter case , the order at which two phase transitions occur and the numerical values of the critical exponents are doubtful too .",
    "obviously , studying the hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) , we can not clarify the point just mentioned , since this hamiltonian describes only the chiral phase transition . in more detail , these and other relevant issues are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one can find a complete list of references ; we mention here only the very recent studies @xcite ( not quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the critical behavior of the frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet in two dimensions is clearer : it undergoes one phase transition mediated by @xmath20 topological defects .",
    "again , a complete list of references can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the debated point concerns whether the lgw hamiltonian is able to keep the non trivial topological excitations present in this model , to the contrary of other approaches like the nonlinear @xmath21 model ( @xmath22 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is claimed that it may be the case and we will assume it in the following .",
    "the lgw hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) has been extensively studied in the framework of @xmath23 @xcite , and by means of the @xmath3 @xcite expansion .",
    "the existence and the stability properties of the fixed points were found to depend on @xmath0 and on the spatial dimensionality @xcite .",
    "within the @xmath24 expansion , for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 the renormalization group equations possess four fixed points : the gaussian fixed point ( @xmath25 ) , the @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) one and two anisotropic fixed points located in the region @xmath28 and usually named chiral and antichiral .",
    "the chiral fixed point is the only stable one .",
    "there is a critical dimensionality @xmath29 where the chiral and antichiral fixed points coalesce and disappear for @xmath30 . in the last case , under the absence of any stable fixed point the system undergoes a weak first - order phase transition , since the associated rg flows run away from the region of stability of the fourth - order form in the free energy expansion .",
    "the three - loop estimate of @xmath29 is @xcite @xmath31 that , after an appropriate resummation , results in @xmath32 in three dimensions .",
    "this inequality leads to the conclusion that for the physical models with @xmath33 the three - dimensional chiral transition is first order , as corroborated also by some other rg studies @xcite . to the contrary , both for @xmath16 and @xmath17 the highest - order six - loop calculations in three dimensions @xcite reveal a strong evidence for a stable chiral fixed point that , however , is not related to its counterpart found within the @xmath24 expansion .",
    "the four - loop two - dimensional analysis shows an equivalent topology of the fixed points location in the renormalized coupling constants plane @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a recent work @xcite we claimed that both in two and three dimensions the controversial situation may reflect the quite unusual mode of critical behavior of the @xmath0-vector chiral model under the physical values of @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that this critical behavior is governed by a stable fixed point which is a focus , attracting rg trajectories in a spiral - like manner .",
    "approaching the fixed point in a nonmonotonic way , looking somewhat irregular , may result in a large variety of the crossover and near - critical regimes .",
    "in this paper , we report the perturbative five - loop two - dimensional rg expansions and carry out their analysis .",
    "some of the results for @xmath1 and @xmath2 was already anticipated in @xcite .",
    "we point out the idea that the critical behavior for large @xmath0 is the one predicted by the @xmath24 expansion . with decreasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the stable chiral fixed point becomes focuslike at some marginal value of @xmath0 , @xmath34 that differs , in principle , from @xmath29 where both chiral and antichiral fixed points disappear . with the precision of our calculations , we are not able to fully clarify if there is a region of values of @xmath0 , where the chiral transition is first order .",
    "it is worthy to note that the parallel work on the three - dimensional models @xcite reveals a full analogy between chiral critical behaviors in two and three dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the perturbative series for the renormalization - group functions up to five - loop order .",
    "the resummations methods and the results of the analysis are presented in sec .",
    "iii . in sec .",
    "iv we draw our conclusions .",
    "the fixed - dimension field - theoretical approach  @xcite represents an effective procedure in the study of the critical properties of systems that undergo second - order phase transitions  @xcite . in the case under consideration ,",
    "the expansion is performed in two quartic coupling constants of the hamiltonian ( [ lgwh ] ) .",
    "the theory is renormalized by a set of zero - momentum conditions for the one - particle irreducible two - point correlation function , four - point correlation function , and two - point correlation function with an insertion of the operator @xmath35 :    @xmath36 , \\label{ren1}\\ ] ]    @xmath37 , \\label{ren2}\\ ] ]    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is an appropriate combinatorial factor @xcite .    the perturbative knowledge of the functions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 allows one to relate the renormalized physical parameters ( @xmath43 ) to the bare ones ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the fixed points of the model are defined by the common zeros of the @xmath45 functions , @xmath46 the stability properties of these points are determined by the eigenvalues @xmath47 of the matrix : @xmath48 a fixed point is stable if both the eigenvalues have a positive real part . if the eigenvalues possess nonvanishing imaginary parts , the fixed point is called a focus and the corresponding rg trajectories are spirals . the eigenvalues @xmath47",
    "are connected to the leading scaling corrections , which go as @xmath49 , with few exceptions as the two - dimensional ising model ( see for a discussion ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the values of the critical exponents @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are related to the rg functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 evaluated at the stable fixed point :    @xmath55    @xmath56 ^{-1 } , \\label{nu_fromtheseries}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 @xmath58      in this section we extend the four - loop perturbative series  @xcite for the rg functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath54 up to five - loop order using the numerical values of two - dimensional five - loop integrals evaluated in ref . @xcite .    in order to obtain finite fixed point values in the limit of infinite components of the order parameter ( @xmath62 ) we use the rescaled couplings @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the resulting rg series are  @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 only the five - loop coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are reported in table [ t3 ] , since up to the fourth order they are reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that , due to the last rescaling , the element of the @xmath71 matrix ( [ omega ] ) are two times the derivative of @xmath72 with respect to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we verify the exactness of our series by checking them in particular limits ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath62 ) as in ref .",
    "@xcite .    .",
    "five - loop coefficients @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 of rg functions . [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ tabellone ]    to further approve the above conclusions , we apply , along with the conformal - mapping based , the resummation by means of the pad - borel technique . in the region where the fixed point is expected",
    ", many pad approximants turn out to be defective , i.e. , possessing dangerous poles .",
    "we find that the approximants @xmath78 $ ] , @xmath79 $ ] , and @xmath80 $ ] are nondefective in the majority of the cases .",
    "considering these three pad approximants with @xmath81 ( being the more stable under variation of the number of loops ) , we finally have nine approximants for each @xmath45 function .",
    "the location of the chiral fixed point is reported in table [ tabellone ] , with all the defective cases discarded .",
    "we also compute the exponents @xmath50 and @xmath54 with both the resummation techniques .",
    "we consider a lot of approximants and finally we choose the more stable ones with varying the number of loops .",
    "the found values are close to those of the @xmath82 model for @xmath83 , but differ from the exact ones coming from @xmath84 model @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( e.g. , we find @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 ) .",
    "we think these discrepancies are due to nonanalyticities , as in the case of @xmath82 models . to conclude the analysis of the fixed points , we study the stability of the heisenberg fixed point by calculating the crossover exponent @xmath91 .",
    "the five - loop results show that this fixed point is unstable , in agreement with the conclusion drawn earlier from the four - loop series  @xcite .",
    "in this subsection we demonstrate the structure of the rg flow for physical values of @xmath0 .",
    "as it was already shown , a stable focus governs the critical behavior of these systems . in fig .",
    "[ fign2d2 ] ( @xmath16 ) one can see the spiral - like approach of the stable fixed point which is peculiar for the fixed points with stability eigenvalues possessing nonvanishing imaginary parts .",
    "the shaded area is the region where the resummation procedure is expected to fail ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) , since we do not take into account the singularity of the borel transform closest to the origin that is on the real positive axis ( cf .",
    "eq ( [ bsing ] ) ) . consequently ,",
    "the rg trajectories given by the resummed perturbative series are quantitatively correct only within the unshaded areas .",
    "we report , nevertheless , the rg flows in other parts of the coupling constant plane in order to present a complete qualitative picture .",
    "note , that the domain usually referred to as the sector of the first - order transitions , where the positiveness of the quartic form in the free - energy expansion breaks down , is given by the inequality @xmath93 .",
    "in fact , however , because of the presence of the higher - order terms in this expansion keeping the system globally stable at any temperature , the true domains of the first - order transitions should be more narrow . from fig .",
    "[ fign2d2 ] we see that for some initial values of @xmath94 the rg trajectories have the coordinate @xmath74 that grows very fast at the beginning and seems to reach the region of the first - order phase transitions , but just before arriving there these trajectories drastically curve moving toward the stable chiral fixed point .",
    "these bizarre trajectories can imitate both the discontinuous phase transitions and strongly scattered effective critical exponents observed in numerous physical and computer experiments . to substantiate the former scenario ,",
    "we calculate the numerical values which the effective exponent @xmath95 takes along the rg trajectories running from the gaussian fixed point to the chiral one .",
    "corresponding curves are shown in fig .",
    "as is seen from this figure , the exponent oscillates within a large range , even near the stable fixed point .",
    "we demonstrate also the rg flows for @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fign3d2 ] ) and for @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ f8 ] ) . in the former ( physical case ) the stable fixed point is a focus and phase trajectories approach it in a spiral - like manner . in the latter ( unphysical case )",
    "the stable fixed point turns out to be a node and the trajectories are certainly not spirals .",
    "also for @xmath17 we estimate the effective exponent @xmath95 along the rg trajectories running from the gaussian fixed point to the chiral one .",
    "the corresponding curves ( cf . fig .",
    "[ crn3 ] ) show big oscillations and sometimes reach negative values .",
    "we note that these negative values are obtained only in the region where the resummation is not sure , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "nevertheless , this strange crossover , if reproduced from the three - dimensional series @xcite , might explain some doubtful experimental results , where a negative @xmath50 was found .    to conclude , it is worthy to note that earlier the focuslike stable fixed points were found on the rg flow diagrams of the model describing critical behavior of liquid crystals @xcite and of the @xmath97-symmetric systems undergoing first - order phase transition close to the tricritical point @xcite . in those cases , however ,",
    "the independent coupling constants had different scaling dimensionality and played essentially different roles in critical thermodynamics .",
    "moreover , recently complex subleading exponents were found from the high - temperature expansion of dyson s hierarchical ising model @xcite .",
    "we studied the critical thermodynamics of the two - dimensional @xmath0-vector chiral model in the five - loop rg approximation . using the advanced resummation technique based upon borel transformation combined with conformal mapping and use of pad approximants",
    ", it was shown that the fixed point governing the chiral critical behavior is a stable node only for large enough @xmath0 , @xmath98 . for smaller @xmath0 a chiral fixed point",
    "turns out be a stable focus and the rg trajectories approach this point in a spiral - like manner",
    ". of particular importance is the fact that a focus - driven critical behavior was found for systems with physical values of @xmath0 , @xmath99 . evaluating the critical exponent @xmath50 along some rg trajectories , we demonstrate that spiral - like approach of the chiral fixed point results in unusual crossover and near - critical regimes that may imitate varying critical exponents seen in physical and computer experiments .",
