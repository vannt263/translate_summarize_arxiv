    "different authors use different notations which makes difficult to recognize the same result appearing on different papers .",
    "for this reason we have tried to simplify and unify the notation by adopting one which seems ( at least to us ) to be the closest to the physics ( especially the quantum physics ) of the problem .",
    "for example , we have not adopted the awkward `` optical '' notation for the pauli matrices    @xmath0    but we have adopted the standard `` quantum '' notation    @xmath1    of course , as a consequence of this choice , also the stokes parameters defined in these notes are different from the standard `` optical '' one . if with @xmath2 we denote the electric field of an homogeneous plane wave propagating along the axis @xmath3 , then _ our _ stokes parameters @xmath4 are defined as @xmath5 where the last three columns display the traditional ( @xmath6 ) , the `` born - wolf '' ( @xmath7 ) , and the `` van de hulst '' ( @xmath8 ) definitions of the stokes parameters , respectively .",
    "it is curious to notice that this change of notation was already suggested in the sixties [ 1 ] but it was unadopted .",
    "the last three stokes parameters form a cartesian coordinate system on the poincar sphere ( fig .",
    "this change of notation for the stokes parameters also causes a change in the definition of the mueller matrix .",
    "for example , if we write the stokes _ vectors _ in ours and in the `` van de hulst '' notation as @xmath9 then , from eq .",
    "( [ i6 ] ) it is easy to see that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related by a _ unitary _",

    "these notes aim to be , from mathematical point of view , as self - contained as possible ; all formulae are derived , the only omitted derivations are the ones which reduce to an explicit calculation . for example",
    "the formula @xmath18 can not be `` demonstrated '' , it must be checked by explicit calculation from the definition of the pauli matrices . however",
    ", all the omitted explicit calculations can be easily done in few seconds with a computer program like mathematica .",
    "as we already said , these notes focus on the _ mathematical _ aspects of the mueller formalism , so no emphasis is given to any physical process .",
    "for this reason in the first part of this script we almost exclusively deal with the case of deterministic ( or mueller - jones ) mueller matrices which requires the knowledge of the same amount of linear algebra results as the more general case .",
    "however , all formulae derived here can be straightforwardly extended to the case of non - deterministic mueller matrices .",
    "a few words about the notation .",
    "we use three different kind of indices : latin , greek and calligraphic .",
    "latin indices @xmath19 run from @xmath20 to @xmath21 and label the components of @xmath22 matrices and @xmath23-d vectors .",
    "greek indices @xmath24 run from @xmath20 to @xmath25 and label the components of @xmath26 matrices and @xmath27-d vectors .",
    "finally , calligraphic indices @xmath28 run from @xmath20 to @xmath29 and label the components of @xmath30-d vectors . in these notes",
    "the einstein summation convention is used extensively , that is the sum on repeated indices ( latin , greek and calligraphic ) is understood .",
    "for example    @xmath31    we often use the direct product of two matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 , indicated with the symbol `` @xmath34 '' :    @xmath35    for this kind of matrix product , the standard convention for the indices is the following :    @xmath36    it worths to note the order of the indices @xmath37 and @xmath38 in both sides of this equation ; it will play an important role in these notes .",
    "in this section we study two different ways to represent @xmath39 matrices and the relations between different representations .",
    "let @xmath40 denotes a @xmath41 complex - valued matrix defined in terms of its elements @xmath42_{ij } \\equiv a_{ij } , \\ , ( i , j=0,1)$ ] as @xmath43 any @xmath41 matrix can be put in one - to - one correspondence with a complex @xmath27-vector @xmath44 by writing @xmath45 where @xmath46 this rule is very simple and can be easily extended to @xmath47 matrices by defining @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",

    "it is necessary to define a norm in the vector space @xmath59 of the complex @xmath41 matrices .",
    "it is possible to introduce a norm in @xmath59 by defining the _ scalar product _ @xmath60 between two matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath61 where summation on repeated indices is again understood and @xmath62 denotes the hermitian - conjugate of @xmath32 ; that is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the complex conjugate and the transpose of @xmath32 respectively . moreover , since @xmath66 , the result @xmath67 follows . by explicit calculation",
