    "in this work we consider a two - flavor njl lagrangian of the form @xcite : @xmath0 \\nonumber \\\\ & -g_v(\\bar q \\gamma^\\mu q)^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a fermion field with @xmath2 flavors and @xmath3 colors .",
    "apart from the bare mass @xmath4 , the lagrangian is chirally symmetric @xmath5 .",
    "we have considered interaction terms in the scalar , pseudoscalar - isovector and vector - isoscalar channels .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the scalar and vector couplings , respectively , and are assumed to be constants with dimension mev@xmath8 .",
    "the mean field thermodynamic potential density at zero temperature and @xmath9 , that are the conditions inside compact stars , with quark energy @xmath10 , is calculated in the hartree approximation and is given by @xcite : @xmath11    the thermodynamic potential density @xmath12 depends on two parameters , the dynamical fermion mass @xmath13 and the renormalized quark chemical potential @xmath14 , which are related to the scalar @xmath15 and vector @xmath16 densities at the chemical potential @xmath17 by @xcite : @xmath18 @xmath19    eq . ( [ gapmass ] ) is the well - known njl gap equation for the dynamical mass @xmath13 . in general , this equation has more than one solution , the physical being the one that minimizes @xmath12 . the vacuum contribution to the thermodynamical potential density diverges and",
    "has to be regularized .",
    "this regularization is carried on by introducing a cutoff @xmath20 .",
    "once we have the thermodynamic potential density , other thermodynamic quantities can be calculated in the standard way .",
    "in particular the baryon number density , energy density and pressure are given respectively by : @xmath21 @xmath22 and @xmath23 where the energy density and the pressure of the physical vacuum was set to zero .",
    "then , for a given baryon chemical potential @xmath17 , these expressions need to be evaluated for the values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 which minimize the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model is one of the most popular models for studying the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and its restoration at finite temperatures or densities @xcite .",
    "the model contains quarks with a current quark mass which acquire a constituent quark mass @xmath13 through the quark interaction . in the mean field approximation",
    ", this interaction produces a quark mass , via a condensation process of quark - antiquark pairs that spontaneously breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "a study of the quark matter stability was done in @xcite , and we analyze here the pressure and energy per particle as a function of the baryonic density @xcite .",
    "the character of the chiral phase transition crucially depends upon the model parameters , particularly the vector coupling constant . for @xmath24",
    "the phase transition is of first order .",
    "however , when @xmath25 it becomes of second order since for different values of @xmath17 , only the @xmath26 minimum exists and it moves continuously to the @xmath27 minimum . in the figure [ enerparticle ] we present the energy per particle for different values of the vector coupling .",
    "we observe that as the ratio @xmath28 increases the quark matter gets less stable .",
    "quark matter inside compact star is neutral with respect to electric charges and color .",
    "moreover , the matter is in @xmath29 equilibrium , i.e. , all process of beta decay of quarks involving electrons and antineutrinos and their inverse process are likely to occur at identical rates .",
    "thus , we must impose both @xmath29 equilibrium and charge neutrality . throughout this paper",
    "we only consider the latest stage in the star evolution , when entropy reaches the maximum and neutrinos have already diffused out .",
    "the neutrino chemical potential is then set to zero . for @xmath29 equilibrium matter we must add the contribution of leptons to the stellar energy density and pressure .",
    "the relation between the chemical potentials of light quarks is determined by beta decay and can be written as @xcite : @xmath30 for charge neutrality we must impose : @xmath31    eqs .",
    "( [ eb ] ) and ( [ nc ] ) need to be satisfied together with the self consistent relations for the quark effective mass during the numerical calculation .",
    "the eos for the leptonic sector is also needed , and is considered as a relativist degenerate fermi gas .",
    "the effect of the vector coupling in the quark matter eos is shown in figure [ eos ] .",
    "we can see that for a certain energy density an increase of @xmath28 increases the pressure .",
    "the equation of state eos becomes stiffer as expected since we know that the vector interaction is repulsive .",
    "the quark matter eos obtained in the previous section are use to solve the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations .",
    "these equations are integrated from the origin , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the central energy density , up to a point where @xmath35 and the pressure is zero . for each eos",
    "we obtain a unique relation between the star mass and its central energy density @xcite .",
    "figure [ massadensc ] presents the curve @xmath36 for different ratios @xmath28 as a function of the central energy density , normalized by the mass of the sun @xmath37 kg . as the vector coupling increases",
    ", we obtain more massive stars for the same central energy density .",
    "the reason lies in the repulsive vector coupling , which makes stiffer the eos .",
    "the internal pressure increases for a given central energy and supports a larger star mass . in the figure [ mr ]",
    "we show the @xmath38 diagram for quark stars .",
    "we see that with the increase of @xmath28 the stars have more mass and larger radii .",
    "the masses and radii of the maximum mass stable configuration obtained with the inclusion of the vector couplings in the su(2 ) version of the njl model are larger than the corresponding njl without the repulsive term .",
    "the radius is still quite small , below 10 km , smaller than the average neutron star value , 12 - 15 km but the mass is larger than the value 1.2 m@xmath39 which many neutron stars show ( see table  [ table:1 ] ) .    [",

    "our study only concerns pure quark stars with two flavors . at star surface",
    "@xmath40 the energy per particle is greater than the nucleon mass and therefore within this model quark matter will hadronize .",
    "thus , these results for pure quark stars need to be seen with caution and we may say that it is more likely to expect in njl model hybrid stars with a quark matter core with two and also three quark flavors .",
    "a work in the su(3 ) version of the njl model with vector interaction is underway .",
    "a superconducting quark phase recently proposed should also be considered @xcite .",
