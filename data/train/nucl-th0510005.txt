    "recently , physicists at brookhaven national laboratory made an announcement that ",
    "rhic serves the perfect liquid \" @xcite .",
    "the agreement of hydrodynamic predictions @xcite of integrated and differential elliptic flow and radial flow patterns with au+au data at rhic energies @xcite is one of the main lines of the announcement .",
    "we first study the sensitivity of this conclusion to different hydrodynamic assumptions in the hadron phase .",
    "it is found that an assumption of chemical equilibrium with neglecting viscosity in the hadron phase in hydrodynamic simulations causes accidental reproduction of transverse momentum spectra and differential elliptic flow data . from a systematic comparison of hydrodynamic results with the experimental data ,",
    "dissipative effects are found to be mandatory in the hadron phase .",
    "therefore , what is discovered at rhic is not only the perfect fluidity of the strongly coupled quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) core but also its dissipative hadronic corona . along the lines of these studies ,",
    "we develop a hybrid dynamical model in which a _ fully three - dimensional _ hydrodynamic description of the qgp phase is followed by a kinetic description of the hadron phase @xcite .",
    "we show rapidity dependence of elliptic flow from this hybrid model supports the above picture . finally ,",
    "we argue that this picture is a manifestation of deconfinement transition , namely , a rapid increase of entropy density in the vicinity of the qcd critical temperature as lattice qcd simulations have been predicted .",
    "a perfect fluid in the qgp phase and the first order phase transition to the hadron phase is assumed in most hydrodynamic simulations @xcite . while one can find various assumptions in the hadron phase , e.g.  ( 1 ) ideal and chemical equilibrium ( ce ) fluid , ( 2 ) ideal and chemically frozen fluid ( or partial chemical equilibrium , pce ) , or ( 3 ) non - equilibrium resonance gas via hadronic cascade models ( hc ) .",
    "hydrodynamic results are compared with the current differential elliptic flow data , @xmath0 , in fig .  20 in ref .",
    "@xcite with putting an emphasis on the difference of assumptions in the hadron phase .",
    "the classes ce and hc reproduce the pion data well . on the contrary ,",
    "results from the second class , pce , deviate from these hydrodynamic results and experimental data . in order to claim the discovery of perfect fluidity from the agreement of hydrodynamic results with @xmath0 data , we need to understand the difference among hydrodynamic results and the deviation from data .",
    "@xmath1 is roughly proportional to @xmath2 in low @xmath2 region for pions .",
    "in such a case , the slope of @xmath0 can be approximated by @xmath3 .",
    "integrated @xmath1 is generated in the early stage of collisions . whereas _ differential _ @xmath1 can be sensitive to the late hadronic stage since @xmath4 indicates interplay between elliptic flow and radial flow .            in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanpt ] , thermal freezeout temperature @xmath5 dependence of @xmath6 for pions including contribution from resonance decays are calculated at a rhic energy by utilizing hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 for pions in the chemically frozen hadronic fluid decreases with decreasing @xmath5 .",
    "this is due to longitudinal @xmath7 work done by fluid elements .",
    "whereas @xmath6 in the chemical equilibrium case increases during expansion . the total number of particles in a fluid element decreases due to the assumptions of chemical equilibrium and entropy conservation in the hadron phase",
    ". then the total energy is distributed among the smaller number of particles as a fluid element expands .",
    "these are the reasons why the different behavior of @xmath6 appears according to the assumption of chemical equilibrium / freezeout . under the chemical equilibrium assumption in ideal hydrodynamic simulations , increasing @xmath6 is commonly utilized so far to fix @xmath5 by fitting @xmath2 slope .",
    "however , this is attained only by neglecting data of particle ratio . if particle ratios are fixed properly in hydrodynamic simulations to reproduce the data , @xmath2 slopes , especially for protons , are hardly reproduced .",
    "the same is true for differential elliptic flow : @xmath8 is reproduced by canceling increase behaviors of both @xmath1 and @xmath6 under chemical equilibrium assumption @xcite .",
    "agreement of the results from the ce model with @xmath2 spectra and @xmath0 data is merely an accident in the sense that this model makes full use of neglecting particle ratio to reproduce them .",
    "so the hc model turns out to be the only model which is able to reproduce particle ratio , @xmath2 spectra and @xmath0 data .",
    "therefore a picture of the dissipative hadronic corona together with the perfect fluid sqgp core is consistent with these experimental data observed at rhic .",
    "according to the discussion in the previous section , we incorporate a hadronic cascade model , jam @xcite , into our previous framework , the  cgc+hydro+jet \" model @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows pseudorapidity dependences of @xmath1 from this hybrid model and ideal 3d hydrodynamics with @xmath9 and 169 mev .",
    "here critical temperature and chemical freezeout temperature are taken as being @xmath10 mev in the hydrodynamic model . in the hybrid model , the switching temperature from a hydrodynamic description to a kinetic one is taken as @xmath11 mev .",
    "ideal hydrodynamics with @xmath9 mev which is so chosen to generate enough radial flow gives a trapezoidal shape of @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "a large deviation between data @xcite and the ideal hydrodynamic result is seen especially in forward / backward rapidity regions .",
    "when hadronic rescattering effects are taken through the hadronic cascade model instead of perfect fluid description of the hadron phase , @xmath1 is not so generated in the forward region due to the dissipation and , eventually , is consistent with the data .",
    "so the perfect fluid sqgp core and the dissipative hadronic corona picture works well also in the forward region .",
    "we can establish a new picture of space - time evolution of produced matter from a careful comparison of hydrodynamic results with experimental data observed at rhic . what is the physics behind this picture ?",
    "@xmath13 is known to be a good measure to see the effect of viscosity where @xmath14 is the shear viscosity and @xmath15 is the entropy density .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show possible scenarios for temperature dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath13 deduced from the discussion in the previous sections .",
    "@xmath13 is small in the qgp phase , which might be comparable with the minimum value @xmath16 @xcite , and the perfect fluid assumption can be valid . while @xmath13 becomes huge in the hadron phase and the dissipation can not be neglected .",
    "shear viscosities of both phases are found to give @xmath17 gev/@xmath18 around @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "so shear viscosity itself appears to increase with temperature monotonically .",
    "the `` perfect fluid '' property of the sqgp is thus not due to a sudden reduction of the viscosity at the critical temperature @xmath19 , but to a sudden increase of the entropy density of qcd matter and is therefore an important signature of deconfinement .",
