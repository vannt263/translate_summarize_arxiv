    "<S> we propose that the unified fano - like interference picture applies to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are observed , respectively , to provide a reasonable interpretation of the asymmetric lines hapes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the fano - like interference induces an extra broad structure @xmath4 in @xmath0 as a companion peak to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> three charmonium - like states @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 observed in @xmath5 annihilation processes are not genuine resonances . under this scenario , it is well explained why @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are absent in the experimental data of the @xmath6 value scan and missing in open - charm decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> although the present work presents a typical application of the fano - like interference in particle physics at the lower energy region , we have reason to believe that the fano - like phenomena may exist in other processes such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which will be accessible at besiii and forthcoming belleii .    </S>",
    "<S> _ introduction._in the past 12 years , dozens of charmonium - like states were observed by several major particle physics experiments such as the cleoc , babar , belle , cdf , d@xmath9 , lhcb , besiii and so on ( see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a concise review ) . with the experimental progress , the family of charmonium - like states has more and more expanded . </S>",
    "<S> these observations have been continuing to surprise us with novel discoveries of the exotic properties , and inspire theorists extensive interest in exploring the underlying mechanism behind those peculiar phenomena . because these observations of charmonium - like states are closely related to non - perturbative effects of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) </S>",
    "<S> , the study on charmonium - like states provides us a good chance to deepen our understanding of the qcd confinement , which is one of the most important issues in particle physics .    </S>",
    "<S> as one of the most famous charmonium - like states , @xmath2 observed right after @xmath10 , was reported by the babar collaboration in 2004 via @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , the belle collaboration confirmed it @xcite , and indicated that at its vicinity there exists a broad structure @xmath4 , which has mass @xmath11 mev and width @xmath12 mev @xcite . besides @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> another charmonium - like state @xmath3 was announced by the babar and belle collaborations in a similar process @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - parity quantum number of both @xmath2 and @xmath3 produced via the @xmath5 annihilation is @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , theorists first had categorized them into the @xmath14 family . </S>",
    "<S> however , this assignment to @xmath2 and @xmath3 is not satisfactory due to the following obstacles :    \\(1 ) there already exist @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 above 4 gev in the @xmath14 family @xcite , so not much room in the @xmath18 family is available for many newly observed charmonium - like states .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(2 ) if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are higher excited charmonia , open - charm decays should stand as dominant decay modes contributing to their total widths , however , until now the open - charm decay channels of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not experimentally observed at all @xcite . then , the large widths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev @xcite , are hardly understood with that assumption .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(3 ) the measurement of @xmath6 value is an effective approach to identify vector resonances like @xmath21 meson and the charmonia in the @xmath14 family . </S>",
    "<S> however , there does not exist any evidence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the @xmath6 value scan @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> \\(4 ) the line shapes of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 peaks observed in the two modes obviously deviate from the lorentzian form and are obviously asymmetric .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath2 and @xmath3 were proposed to be exotic states , including hybrid charmonium @xcite and molecular states @xcite . among these possible exotic structures , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath22 molecular state @xcite should strongly couple to the nearby @xmath22 final state . </S>",
    "<S> however , lack of the signal of @xmath2 in that channel poses a serious challenge to that aforementioned exotic - state explanation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we should admit that the identity of @xmath2 and @xmath3 is not as previously proposed . </S>",
    "<S> due to the existing confusion about @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we have re - examined them by trying an alternative approach . </S>",
    "<S> the new mechanism under consideration is different from the previous viewpoints and determines that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 peaks are not real resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism indeed offers a reasonable explanation to the exotic behaviors of the observed peaks . </S>",
    "<S> concretely , we propose that a unified fano - like interference would be the responsible scenario .    in physics , the fano interference which was studied a long time ago for understanding some problems in atomic and nuclear physics , results in a fano resonance . in that framework , the genuine mass eigenstate @xmath23 ( or @xmath24 s ) interacts with the continuum via the fano hamiltonian and the consequence is that the peak position of @xmath23 is shifted and an additional phase is caused which would distort the gaussian line shape of the resonance @xmath23 to be asymmetric @xcite .    in this work , by checking the experimental data of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , we determine that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not genuine resonances , and the two peaks observed in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , actually are consequences of a fano - like interference of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the continuum contributions . </S>",
    "<S> thus the line shapes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 observed in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are asymmetric @xcite due to the extra fano phase . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the two well known charmonia @xmath16 and @xmath17 are close to the peak positions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite , and obviously , the fano effects could shift them to the positions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we are tempted to conclude that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not genuine resonances , but the fano - like interference of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with their respective continua results in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this picture can naturally answer why @xmath2 and @xmath3 are absent in the @xmath6 value scan @xcite and the measured cross sections of @xmath5 annihilation into open - charm final states do not receive contributions from @xmath2 and @xmath3 at all @xcite .    in atomic physics @xcite , condensed matter </S>",
    "<S> physics @xcite , and even nuclear physics @xcite the fano interference phenomena have been widely studied . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the interference between the signal of the higgs resonance in gluon fusion and the continuum background for @xmath25 was also considered by dixon and li a while ago @xcite and it is a fano - like effect as a matter of fact . along the same lines , </S>",
    "<S> a while ago cao and lenske @xcite indicated that the distortion of the @xmath26 line shape could be understood by the fano effect . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , there were some papers which discussed the importance of this mechanism in @xmath27 physics @xcite . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we apply the fano - like interference picture to explain puzzles for charmonium - like states @xmath2 and @xmath3 and it is a typical example in particle physics at the lower energy region to discuss hadron spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the success of the application not only reveals the underlying mechanism resulting in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but also stimulates extensive interest in exploring other fano interference phenomena in hadronic reactions .    </S>",
    "<S> _ fano - like interference picture for @xmath2 and @xmath3._the fano - like interference refers to the interference between continuum and resonance contributions . for an analytical calculation on the interference between the continuum and resonance contributions to @xmath28 , </S>",
    "<S> one needs concrete information about the background . since so far , no data on the pure background are available , for describing the continuum contribution we have to adopt an empirical formula to deal with the background , namely , the cross section contributed by the continuum background is written as @xmath29{back.eps}\\raisebox{0.5cm}{$\\widehat{= } g\\ , u^2 e^{-a u^2}$ } \\label{eq : nonr } % \\end{figure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath30 being the available kinetic energy , where @xmath31 is total energy in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath5 and @xmath32 sums over the masses of all particles in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , two phenomenological parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are obviously related to non - perturbative qcd , can be treated as free parameter to be determined by fitting the experimental data of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression indeed gives a smooth curve for the background and this expression is somehow similar to the formula for describing the background in three - body decays of b - mesons , i.e. , the argus function . </S>",
    "<S> however since there is no experimental support to the empirical formula , in the following computations , we will turn to an alternative way to determine the fano - interference .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the continuum contribution , there exists contribution to @xmath28 from the genuine resonances , where electron and positron annihilate into a virtual photon , which converts into a vector charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> later this charmonium which is on mass shell decays into the final state @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the mode induced by the intermediate vector charmonium interacts with the direct annihilation of @xmath5 into @xmath35 which stands as the continuum background , via the fano - like hamiltonian . since the fano - like interaction shifts the peak position of the resonance to the experimentally observed position , </S>",
    "<S> thus the key point is to identify a suitable intermediate vector charmonium which must possess the required quantum numbers and not be far away from the observed peak . </S>",
    "<S> that is the crucial task . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we notice that the charmonium - like structure @xmath2 under discussion resides between two well known higher charmonia @xmath16 and @xmath17 . we suppose that via a fano - like interaction , they may produce the @xmath2 and @xmath3 signals .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , the contribution of a higher charmonium to @xmath28 can be described as @xmath29{resonance.eps}\\raisebox{0.5cm}{$\\widehat{= } \\frac{\\sqrt{12\\pi \\gamma^{e^+e^-}_{\\psi } \\times \\mathcal{b}(\\psi \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- j/\\psi)\\gamma_{\\psi}}}{s - m_{\\psi}^2+im_{\\psi } \\gamma_{\\psi } } \\sqrt{\\frac{\\phi_{\\mathrm{2\\to3}}(s)}{\\phi_{\\mathrm{2\\to3}}(m_{\\psi}^2)}}$ } , \\label{eq : res } % \\end{figure}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 denotes the phase space for @xmath37 , while @xmath38 is obtained by replacing @xmath39 in @xmath36 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 is either @xmath16 or @xmath40 as the intermediate vector charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> the masses and decay widths of @xmath16 and @xmath17 take the central values given in the pdg average data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the production rate @xmath41 is set as a free parameter in our computations and will be determined by fitting data .    after considering the interference between continuum and resonance contributions , the total signal amplitude of @xmath37 can be parametrized as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : nonr])-([eq : res ] ) . in this signal amplitude , there exist 6 free parameters , which are , @xmath46    with this constructed simple and explicit model , we analyze the experimental data of the cross sections for @xmath37 @xcite for testing whether the charmonium - like structure @xmath2 can be reproduced via the fano - like interference . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted the cross section of @xmath37 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4260 ] , where the experimental data are taken from publications of the belle @xcite and cleo collaborations @xcite .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4260 ] , one may conclude : ( 1 ) the asymmetric @xmath2 line shape can be well reproduced by the fano - like interference , which provides direct evidence that the observed @xmath2 is a fake resonance . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) just as indicated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , there exists a broad structure , which corresponds to @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> our result shows that this broad structure @xmath4 , which is a companion peak to @xmath2 , is also induced by the fano - like interference . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the charmonium - like structure @xmath4 is also not a genuine resonance .     in the fano - like interference picture and a comparison with the experimental data of the cross section for @xmath37 @xcite is provided.,width=302 ]    cccc + @xmath34 & @xmath47 & @xmath33 & @xmath48 + @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 + @xmath53 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 +   + @xmath34 & @xmath57 & @xmath33 & @xmath58 + @xmath49 & @xmath59 & @xmath51 & @xmath60 + @xmath53 & @xmath61 & @xmath55 & @xmath62 +    </S>",
    "<S> the parameters determined by fitting the experimental data of the cross section of @xmath37 are listed in table [ tab : y4260 ] , which is believed to provide valuable information toward further studying similar effects .    </S>",
    "<S> now we would like to investigate what other consequences and predictions we may draw from this scenario .    </S>",
    "<S> the production rates @xmath63 and @xmath64 are fitted to be @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . by fitting the data of @xmath0 ( both line shape and cross section ) , we gain the production rates @xmath49 and @xmath53 which are products of two factors . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath67 is known , we would immediately calculate the branching ratio @xmath68 which can be compared with the directly measured data of the three - body decay . </S>",
    "<S> if the two values are consistent , our scenario would be further confirmed .    </S>",
    "<S> using the dilepton partial widths @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xcite , we get the branching ratios of @xmath71 and @xmath72 to be @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . unfortunately </S>",
    "<S> , however , so far the experimental measurements on the branching ratios of such modes do not reach a satisfactory accuracy level , i.e , the corresponding errors are across a wide range , so that any solid conclusion are hard to make at present yet . </S>",
    "<S> however , on the optimistic aspect , the rough measurements still provide valuable information for theoretical studies . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limit of @xmath75 was measured to be @xmath76 by the cleo collaboration @xcite , which is quoted by particle data group @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with the available data even though they are not precise .     but for the line shape of the cross section for @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data are taken from the measurement of the babar @xcite and the belle @xcite collaborations . </S>",
    "<S> , width=302 ]    when the @xmath2 signal is successfully reproduced through the fano - like interference picture , we naturally extend the same mechanism to study another charmonium - like structure @xmath3 observed in @xmath78 . our model in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : total ] ) also applies to this investigation . by fitting the experimental data of the cross sections of @xmath78 @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the values of fitted parameters which are listed in the lower part of the table [ tab : y4260 ] altogether with that for @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding energy distribution curve of the @xmath78 cross section which is calculated in our model is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : y4360 ] meanwhile the experimental data @xcite are also presented in the same figure for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the case of @xmath2 observed in the cross sections of @xmath37 , the structure @xmath3 is also asymmetric . here </S>",
    "<S> , introducing the fano - like interference between the continuum and @xmath80 resonance contributions , the typical asymmetric structure around 4.36 gev appearing in the @xmath78 energy distribution is well reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that unlike @xmath79 , at the energy distribution of @xmath78 , no extra peak shows up , thus we conclude that appearance of the @xmath4 peak is due to the interference of @xmath16/@xmath17 with the continuum of @xmath79 only .    </S>",
    "<S> the fitted results determine the production rates @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be @xmath83 and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the branching ratios of @xmath85 and @xmath86 can be estimated as @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound of @xmath68 was reported to be @xmath89 by the cleo collaboration @xcite , which is also consistent with our results . </S>",
    "<S> since those branching ratios have not been well experimentally measured so far , we suggest to carry out further experimental study on these hidden - charm dipion decays up to a high accuracy .         to understand the functions of the resonances and the continuum background , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sep ] , their individual contributions to the mass spectra are shown along with the final result where the interferences are accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that the line shapes of the interferences in the cross sections for @xmath37 and @xmath77 are very similar . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we also check the obtained fitted parameters listed in table [ tab : y4260 ] , and find similarity in the corresponding fitted parameters , which reflects the similarity between @xmath78 and @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion._so far , there were five charmoinum - like states @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 observed through the @xmath5 annihilation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding hidden - charm dipion productions may play an important role for studying those charmonium - like states . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the asymmetric line shapes of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and propose a unified fano - like interference picture , by which the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 structures are well reproduced . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are all not genuine resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the fano - like interference reasonably answers why @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 signals are absent in the @xmath6 value scan and the corresponding open - charm decay modes have never been observed . </S>",
    "<S> all these puzzles have been existing in studies on these charmonium - like states for a long time since @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 were reported by several experimental collaborations .    for higher charmonia </S>",
    "<S> , their open - charm decays may compose the dominant modes , but meanwhile their hidden - charm dipion ( or dikaon ) decays are also non - negligible . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , so far , measurements on the two crucial modes are only at preliminary stages , i.e. , no reliable data are available . </S>",
    "<S> thus , from the theoretical aspect , we believe that two well - established higher charmonia @xmath16 and @xmath17 should decay into @xmath92 and @xmath93 with relatively large branching ratios . however , when checking the experimental data of @xmath94 @xcite and @xmath95 @xcite , we notice absence of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 signals . </S>",
    "<S> alternately , explicit @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures exist in the corresponding @xmath92 and @xmath93 distributions . by the fano - like interference picture , higher charmonia @xmath16 and @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> interfere with the continuum contribution to result in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures . </S>",
    "<S> finally , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not the typical breit - wigner distribution to be responsible for these measured @xmath94 @xcite and @xmath95 cross sections . by our model </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the branching ratios of @xmath16 and @xmath17 decaying into @xmath92 and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> the results will be checked by future precise experimental measurements , so that they are not only valuable information for the studies on @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but also can be applied to verify the proposed picture .    in summary , the present study provides an optimistic scenario to understand these peculiar charmonium - like states . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that the proposed mechanism may stimulate more extensive discussions about charmonium - like states . before closing this work , we would like to persuade our experimental colleagues to carry out a study on similar processes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where the resonance contributions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 would interfere with the continuum contribution . </S>",
    "<S> such fano - like interference phenomena should be observed by besiii and forthcoming belleii which have a remarkable opportunity to make solid confirmation about the mechanism ( or negate it ) . </S>"
