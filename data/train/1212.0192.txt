    "lattice qcd calculations predicted a phase transition from a hadron gas to a deconfined matter in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite . a hot and dense partonic matter formed in the process , called quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ,",
    "is found to be strongly interacting experimentally .",
    "searching for the phase boundary and critical point  @xcite has been always an important topic in our physics world . for this purpose ,",
    "rhic star collaboration completed a beam energy scan program in 2010 , which offers us a good way to vary the chemical potential and temperature in the phase diagram .",
    "for these years , an away - side double peak structure observed in rhic experiments has long been interpreted as the interaction between jets and medium , therefore it is regarded as a signal of the qgp phase formation .",
    "there have been many theoretical works on explaining the physical mechanisms of this double peak structure , such as shock wave model  @xcite , gluon radiation model  @xcite , medium - induced gluon bremsstrahlung  @xcite , waking the colored plasma and sonic mach cones  @xcite , sonic booms and diffusion wakes in thermal gauge - string duality  @xcite , jet deflection @xcite and strong parton cascade mechanism etc  @xcite .",
    "however , constructing an ideal dihadron correlation background is a complex task since it is contaminated by many uncertain sources .",
    "for example , a higher harmonic flow background has been discussed in several recent papers @xcite .",
    "their results show that those odd orders of harmonic flows , such as triangular flow ( @xmath1 ) , which are induced by initial geometry fluctuations , can significantly contribute to the away - side double peak structure .    in this paper , two methods for calculating background are employed and will be discussed in detail .",
    "we concentrate on the study of transverse momentum ( @xmath2 ) and centrality dependences of jet - medium contribution to the dihadron azimuthal correlation functions .",
    "we investigate the two - particle away - side structure in 200 gev / c au+au collisions at different centralities of 0 - 10% , 20 - 40% and 50 - 80% .",
    "we will focus on the central collisions where qgp is mostly predicted to be produced , in which jet - induced signals in different associated @xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) bins are shown .",
    "the paper is organized as followed .",
    "section ii gives a brief introduction on our simulation model .",
    "section iii describes our analysis method for dihadron azimuthal correlations , especially for our background construction method in detail .",
    "the results and discussions about dihadron correlation are given in section iv which is followed by a summary in section v.",
    "in this paper , a hybrid model named as a multi - phase transport model ( ampt )  @xcite , is employed to study dihadron azimuthal correlations .",
    "it includes four main components to describe the physical processes in relativistic heavy - ion collisions : 1 ) the initial conditions from hijing model  @xcite , 2 ) partonic interactions modeled by zhang s parton cascade model ( zpc )  @xcite , 3 ) hadronization , and 4 ) hadronic rescattering simulated by a relativistic transport ( art ) model  @xcite .",
    "the basic flow of simulation is in the following .",
    "first , many excited strings initiated from hijing are melted into partons in the ampt version with string melting mechanism  @xcite(abbr .  the melting ampt version \" ) and a simple quark coalescence model is used to combine the partons into hadrons . on the other hand , in the default version of ampt model  @xcite(abbr .  the default ampt version \" ) , minijet partons are recombined with their parent strings when they stop interactions and the resulting strings are converted to hadrons via the lund string fragmentation model  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the melting ampt version undergoes a partonic phase much more than the default ampt version .",
    "details of the ampt model can be found in a review paper  @xcite and previous works  @xcite .",
    "we use the melting ampt version to do the simulation for 200 gev / c au+au collisions . in order to concentrate on partonic stage interactions ,",
    "final hadronic rescattering process is turned off in our simulation as well .",
    "the analysis method for raw dihadron azimuthal correlations is similar to that used in previous experiments  @xcite which derives the azimuthal correlation between a high @xmath2 particle ( trigger particle ) and low @xmath2 particles ( associated particles ) . in our work",
    ", we give a @xmath4 2.5 gev / c cut on trigger particles and select the associated particles whose @xmath3 is smaller than 2.5 gev / c . both the trigger and associated particles",
    "are required to be within a pseudo - rapidity window of @xmath5 .",
    "the raw signal is obtained by accumulating pairs of trigger and associated particles into @xmath6 distributions in the same event .",
    "normally the dihadron combinational background can be described by the formula of    @xmath7    as used in ref .",
    "@xcite , where suffix @xmath8 in @xmath9stands for event - averaged quantity , quantities without suffixes are ones for each event .",
    "we adopt the same analysis method as in ref .",
    "@xcite and obtain the initial geometry anisotropy @xmath10 with event plane angle from the stage before the parton cascade , in order to exclude as much nonflow contribution as possible .",
    "we first calculate the event plane angle of each harmonic order by using the following formula : @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the polar coordinates of partons in the initial coordinate space .",
    "then we can obtain @xmath14 and @xmath15 using the formula : @xmath16 \\right \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle in the final state momentum space .",
    "it effectively eliminates much nonflow contributions to harmonic flows by this way @xcite . from the @xmath17 versus @xmath2 plots as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can see that even in the most central collision ( b = 0 fm ) , it is better to include higher order flow ( up to fifth order ) in background construction .",
    "therefore , we include up to fifth order flow contribution in background reconstruction .    however , it was worried that if one multiplies @xmath14 and @xmath15 before being event averaged , two - particle @xmath17 correlation could be a large contribution to the background , i.e. whether the factorization ( @xmath18= @xmath19 ) is held or not .",
    "it has been noticed that the other modified form of the formula is also used in some works @xcite(it should be noted here that they apply systematic errors on @xmath17 , using background ( 1 ) as the upper bound ) :    @xmath20    the difference between formula ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) contains two kinds of contributions : 1 .",
    "flow fluctuation and its correlation from initial geometry asymmetry ; 2 .",
    "nonflow and its correlation . the first kind of contribution should be included in background while the second kind should be excluded .",
    "however , neither background ( 1 ) and background ( 4 ) can meet the demand .",
    "background ( 1 ) overestimates background by including nonflow contribution while background ( 4 ) underestimates the background by throwing away the background from flow fluctuation and its correlation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that there have been some efforts to solve the crucial problem on decomposing flow , flow fluctuation , and nonflow  @xcite .",
    "although an ideal background is hard to be obtained , we can use the two formulas ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) as the upper and lower limits of the background to get a reasonable range of jet - medium contribution .",
    "next , background is reconstructed using formula ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) as the upper and lower limits for dihadron background .",
    "correspondingly they are marked as  background ( 1 ) \" and  background ( 4 ) \" in the figures .",
    "the detailed values of parameters @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 used in these two background extractions are listed in appendix a.    from the formulas ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) , we can see that the normalization factor of the background should be @xmath24 theoretically .",
    "however , only zyam scheme ( a zero yield at minimum ) can be used to adjust this factor to match the signal best experimentally .",
    "however , we checked that the difference between the theoretical normalization factor and the zyam adjustment is less than 3% .",
    "1 shows the dihadron azimuthal correlations ( both raw and combined harmonic background ) which are divided into three @xmath0 bins and three centrality bins .",
    "two backgrounds are drawn simultaneously as a comparison .",
    "first , we can observe an obvious difference in background shape in different centralities .",
    "the central 0 - 10% events have flatter or even double - peak shape background , while 20 - 40% and 50 - 80% have a single - gaussian shape background . that is due to the different propagation properties of harmonic flows for different centralities .",
    "the existence of the hot dense matter ( qgp ) propagates the initial geometry irregularities to a larger extent . in comparison to the tendency of @xmath3 dependence of @xmath25",
    ", @xmath1 shows a stronger dependence especially in large @xmath3 range @xcite , which makes @xmath26 increases more rapidly and further results in the change of combinational background shape as one can see the background shape becomes flatter and becomes a double peak in the @xmath2 range from 1.4 to 2.0 gev / c .",
    "for the two backgrounds , they tend to have similar shapes and just differs a little bit in magnitudes .",
    "second , we can see a seemingly changing trend of the signal using either background .",
    "therefore , we need to subtract the background and further study the jet - medium contribution . the corresponding plots are shown in fig .",
    "2 . in fig .",
    "2 , first from the global comparisons between different pads , we can observe an obvious change in signal shape .",
    "signals in more central events ( 0 - 10% ) or higher @xmath0 range ( eg .",
    "1.4 - 2.0 gev / c ) tend to have flatter signals while peripheral 50 - 80% events almost show a single - peak shape signal .",
    "this difference is consistent with the medium modification picture .",
    "the existence of qgp strongly modifies jets which makes the correlation shape flatter ( or more broadened ) in more central collisions .",
    "in addition , it also suppresses higher @xmath2 particles . on the contrary ,",
    "if jets just interact less with surrounding medium particles , the correlation shape will tend to be single gaussian .",
    "in addition , the previous results indicate that there should be some parts of contribution from hot spots by switching off jet production  @xcite .    in this analysis , a quantity named  jet relative contribution \" is used to represent the contribution of jet - medium correlation in total dihadron correlation function .",
    "it is defined as the jet - medium correlation function yield divided by the raw dihadron correlation yield ( including flow background ) .",
    "these jet relative contributions in different centrality bins and @xmath0 bins are obtained and shown in fig .",
    "3 .    panels ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) in fig .",
    "3 are for near - side and panels ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) are for away - side .",
    "the jet relative contribution using two different backgrounds are drawn together to provide an upper and lower limit . from panel ( d )",
    ", one can see that the away - side jet relative contribution in central 0 - 10% events drops in @xmath0 range from 1.4 to 2.0 gev / c , different from the case on near - side ( panel ( a ) ) .",
    "this is consistent with the high @xmath2 suppression picture in qgp .",
    "the quantitative values are provided in table i and ii . in general , the away - side jet relative contribution is less than 5% in central 0 - 10% events ."
