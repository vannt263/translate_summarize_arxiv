    "the infrared spectra of a wide variety of objects associated with dust and gas  including  regions , post - agb stars , pne , young stellar objects ( ysos ) , the diffuse ism and galaxies  are dominated by emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.7  @xmath0 m , ( cf . * ? ? ?",

    "since the carriers of these features remained a mystery for almost a decade , the initial name for these features , the unidentified infrared ( uir ) emission features , is still in use .",
    "however , these is also an unfortunate proliferation of other names ( table  [ ep : names ] ) .",
    "here we use the term uirs to refer to these features .    in the early 80s",
    ", it was recognized that the uir features coincide with the vibrational modes characteristic of aromatic materials @xcite . since then , many different carriers have been proposed such as hydrogenated amorphous carbon ( hac , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , quenched carbon composites ( qcc , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs , e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , coal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nanodiamonds @xcite , rydberg matter @xcite and most recently locally aromatic polycyclic hydrocarbons @xcite .",
    "while the vibrational spectrum of ( almost ) any exclusively aromatic material can provide a global fit to the observed uir features , they are generally attributed to _ small _ aromatic hydrocarbon species .",
    "the main argument for this is the detection of the uir features in reflection nebulae far from illuminating stars and the independence of the color temperature with the distance from the star .",
    "taken together , these observations indicate that the carriers of the uir features can be excited to very high `` temperatures '' in such cold environments upon absorption of a _ single _ fuv photon @xcite .",
    "this requires the emitting species to be very small , containing a finite number of oscillators .",
    "classical 0.1 @xmath0 m size grains are too large and do not become hot enough to emit at mid - infrared wavelengths in these environments . hence the uir features are attributed to species of the order of 10 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to molecules containing @xmath1 50100 carbon atoms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this aspect of the uir feature phenomenon has now been reinforced by iso and irts observations which reveal that the mid - infrared spectra of the ( diffuse ) ism is dominated by these ir emission features ( see onaka , these proceedings ; * ? ? ?",

    "it should be emphasized that , at the smallest scales , all of the proposed grain carriers ( hac , qcc , coal , ... ) share an aromatic hydrocarbon structure with pah molecules .",
    "however , some of these carriers may vary in detail from pah molecules ( adopting their chemical definition ) , even at sizes required by the energetics , by including aliphatic hydrocarbon chains , by containing substitution of other elements such as n or o for a c atom in a pah , or by having d or molecular sidegroups substituting for an h atom in a pah . however , limits on the presence of other functional groups are very strict @xcite . methyl groups ( -ch@xmath2 ) are the most abundant at 0.02 of aromatic h ( or equivalently @xmath10.01 relative to aromatic c ) .",
    "other substitutions such as oh and nh@xmath3 are less abundant than 0.01 relative to aromatic h. there is some spectroscopic evidence for the presence of oxygen bonded in the form of carbonyl groups ( -c = o ; much less then 0.01 relative to aromatic c ) .",
    "all other species are at a very low level .    in short",
    ", the excitation of such small species should be discussed in molecular physics terms .",
    "an absorption of a fuv photon by a small aromatic hydrocarbon induces a transition to an upper electronic state .",
    "the excited molecule then makes rapid isoenergetic transitions to highly vibrationally excited levels of the ground electronic state .",
    "subsequently , this highly vibrationally excited molecule relaxes , mainly by ir emission in the cc and ch fundamental vibrational modes ( * ? ? ?",

    "remarkably 20 - 30% of the galactic ir radiation is emitted in these uir features and 10 - 15% of the cosmic carbon is locked up in the uir carriers @xcite .",
    "being so widespread and abundant , they play a crucial role in several astrophysical processes .",
    "aromatic units are the building blocks in the cosmic carbon condensation route @xcite .",
    "the uir carriers dominate the heating and cooling of the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) via photoelectric ejection @xcite , infrared emission and gas - grain collisional cooling @xcite .",
    "in addition , they influence the charge balance and in this way  through their influence on the equilibrium state of chemical reactions  gas - phase abundances in interstellar ( is ) clouds @xcite",
    ". in particular , they might reduce the gas - phase d / h ratio @xcite . due to their large surface areas",
    ", they also affect the on - going surface chemistry and so play a significant role in is chemistry @xcite .",
    "lastly , they are an important , chemically accessible , source of prebiotic organic material .",
    "although the presence of aromatic hydrocarbon species in space is now generally accepted , today , specifics of the emitting population remain elusive .",
    "progress is being made however ( e.g. hudgins & allamandola , these proceedings ) and strong constraints are placed on molecular structures @xcite , sizes @xcite , heteroatom substitution @xcite , charge balance @xcite and related properties @xcite .",
    "the combination of the astronomical observations with the laboratory and theoretical studies increases our understanding of how the local environment and/or the history influence the composition of this population ; and vice - versa , how the aromatic hydrocarbon molecules influence the local physical and chemical processes .",
    "such insight is also essential if we want to use the uir emission features as tools for probing the universe .",
    "many studies have attempted to solve pieces of this puzzle and here we review the progress made in the observational domain since the launch of the infrared space observatory ( iso ) . with its complete access to the 2.3197  @xmath0 m , wavelength range , iso allowed the study of the uir features in all their glory . complemented with observations by the irts and recent ground - based instruments ,",

    "[ ep : rich ] illustrates the spectral richness and some of the variations of the uir spectra",
    ". clearly , many weaker features are present apart from the major uir features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.7  @xmath0 m .",
    "some of these features are perched on top of emission plateaux of variable strength .",
    "these plateaux are treated in 2 ways . either they are assumed to be part of the individual features and fitted with lorentzians in combination with a power - law continuum ( fig .",
    "[ ep : joblin ] , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . or , they are considered independently of the individual features and then local spline continua are used ( fig .",
    "[ ep : rich ] , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter is based upon early observations revealing a different spatial distribution for the plateaux and the features @xcite . adopting the latter method ,",
    "the 3.3  @xmath0 m feature is situated on a broad plateau and is often accompanied by features at 3.4 and/or 3.5  @xmath0 m .",
    "two weaker features are found at 5.2 and 5.7  @xmath0 m .",
    "the 6.2 and 11.2  @xmath0 m features are accompanied with satellite features at 6.0 , 11.0 and sometimes at @xmath16.6  @xmath0 m .",
    "the broad 7.7  @xmath0 m complex is composed of at least 2 subcomponents at 7.6 and 7.8  @xmath0 m .",
    "some sources exhibit more substructures e.g. near 7.2 to 7.4 and 8.2  @xmath0 m @xcite",
    ". a broad emission plateau of variable strength is present underneath the 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath0 m features .",
    "the onset of this emission plateau seems to be variable and falls longwards of @xmath1 6  @xmath0 m while it extends to @xmath1 9  @xmath0 m .",
    "the out - of - plane ch bending modes are present at 10.8 , 11.0 , 11.2 , 12.0 , 12.7 , 13.2 and 14.5  @xmath0 m and also sit on a broad emission plateau . at even longer wavelengths ,",
    "a new feature has been reported at 16.4  @xmath0 m @xcite as well as a weak emission plateau between 15 and 20  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that not all sources show all these emission features at the same time and their peak position and relative strength vary as discussed below .",
    "the importance of this family of emission features can not be over emphasized .",
    "these emission features are now found in almost all environments including diffuse ism , the edges of molecular clouds , reflection nebulae , young stellar objects ,  regions , star forming regions , some c - rich wr stars , post - agb stars , planetary nebulae , novae , normal galaxies , starburst galaxies , most ultra - luminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) and agns .",
    "thus , it is no exaggeration to say that the niche for the uir carriers is the universe .",
    "until quite recently , most of the interstellar emission features were considered to be more - or - less invariant in position and profile .",
    "the 3.3  @xmath0 m feature is the exception .",
    "high resolution observations by @xcite and @xcite showed slight variations in peak position and profile .",
    "although some minor variations were noted , by and large the 6.2  @xmath0 m feature was considered fixed at 6.2  @xmath0 m , regardless of the reported shift in peak position by @xcite .",
    "the `` 7.7 ''",
    "@xmath0 m feature was generally treated similarly in spite of earlier papers showing this feature is comprised of at least two variable components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has long been recognized that the 7.7  @xmath0 m complex appears either with a dominant 7.6  @xmath0 m component or with the dominant component peaking at 7.88  @xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the former profile is associated with  regions and the latter with planetary nebulae @xcite .",
    "using iso - sws spectra , @xcite and @xcite have carried out a detailed study of the well - known uir features in a large sample of reflection nebulae ,  regions , ysos , evolved stars and galaxies .",
    "these authors found that the peak position of the uir features clearly varies from source to source ( see fig .",
    "[ ep : prof_sws ] ) .",
    "in addition , distinct differences are found in their profiles . in particular , the 6.2  @xmath0 m profile is very asymmetric with a steep blue wing and a red tail when peaking at the shortest wavelengths ( 6.22 @xmath0 m ) but it is generally far more symmetric when peaking at the longest wavelengths ( i.e. 6.3  @xmath0 m ) .",
    "nevertheless , more asymmetric profiles peaking at 6.36.4  @xmath0 m are also reported for hydrogen deficient environments @xcite .",
    "the 7.7  @xmath0 m complex is indeed comprised of two components , one at 7.6 @xmath0 m and one at `` 7.8 '' @xmath0 m . the feature varies from a profile with a dominant to a minor 7.6  @xmath0 m component while simultaneously shifting , as a whole , to longer wavelengths .",
    "the peak position of the `` 7.8 '' component is highly variable and ranges from 7.8 up to 8  @xmath0 m .",
    "several sources show an additional subcomponent between 7.2 and 7.4  @xmath0 m ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the profile of the 8.6  @xmath0 m feature is clearly symmetric and similar for all sources .",
    "however , distinct shifts in peak position are also observed for this feature .",
    "four sources are known to date that show a peculiar 8.6  @xmath0 m feature ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". a very limited number of sources does not show a 7.7  @xmath0 m complex nor a 8.6  @xmath0 m feature but instead exhibit a broad emission feature peaking at 8.22  @xmath0 m .",
    "this is clearly distinct from the 8  @xmath0 m emission feature found in some post - agb stars .",
    "the 3.3  @xmath0 m profile is clearly symmetric when positioned at the shortest wavelengths and asymmetric when peaking at slightly longer wavelengths .",
    "the former profile has a similar peak position and fwhm as the type 1 profile of @xcite , the latter has a peak position similar to their type 2 but is much wider .",
    "the 11.2  @xmath0 m profile comprises a steep blue rise and a red tail and only shows small variations in both peak position and profile .",
    "m uir features . for all features , class @xmath4 peaks at the shortest wavelengths ( black line ) , and class @xmath5 peaks at longer wavelength . in the 69  @xmath0 m region , another class ( @xmath6 ) is defined peaking at even longer wavelength with a unique spectral appearance . for details see @xcite and @xcite . ]",
    "the observed pronounced contrast in the spectral variations for the ch modes versus the cc modes is striking : the peak wavelengths of the features attributed to cc modes ( 69 @xmath0 m ) vary by @xmath12550 @xmath7 , while for the ch modes ( 3.3 and 11.2 @xmath0 m features ) the variations are smaller , @xmath146.5 @xmath7 . moreover ,",
    "these profile variations in the cc modes are directly linked with each other , i.e. the 6.2  @xmath0 m profile a is correlated with the 7.7  @xmath0 m profile a@xmath8 and the 8.6  @xmath0 m profile a@xmath9 while the 6.2  @xmath0 m profile b is correlated with the 7.7  @xmath0 m profile b@xmath8 and the 8.6  @xmath0 m profile b@xmath9 .",
    "in contrast , the ch feature profile variations appear less connected to each other or to those found for the cc modes .",
    "as already noted by @xcite and @xcite for the 7.7  @xmath0 m complex , the specific profile of the cc modes ( but less for the ch modes ) depend directly on the type of object .",

    ". the 3.3  @xmath0 m profile in the iso - sws spectrum ( integrated over a 14@xmath11 20@xmath10 beam ) belongs to class b and hence has a similar peak position as type 2 features but with a larger fwhm .",
    "the latter is likely caused by the increasing blue shoulder ( as seen in the spatial study ) , however , it is unclear why the peak position is not influenced by this .",
    "similarly , the 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath0 m uir features in the red rectangle show significant spatial variations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* song et al . in preparation ) . in particular , the 7.7  @xmath0 m",
    "complex evolves from a feature with a minor to one with a dominant 7.6  @xmath0 m component with larger distance from the star .",
    "consistent with this , the 8.6  @xmath0 m uir feature shifts to shorter wavelengths with distance from the star .",
    "hence , with increasing distance from the star , these features seem to evolve from those observed in the iso - sws ( integrated ) spectra of pne and the red rectangle to those of  regions and the ism .",
    "in addition , the variations of the 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath0 m features within the red rectangle show the same correlated behavior as found from source to source .",
    "@xcite have studied the spatial behavior of the uir features in three rne using isocam - cvf observations .",
    "isocam allows a spatial resolution of 1.5 , 3 , 6 or 12@xmath10 whereas iso - sws spectra integrate a larger area ( 14@xmath11 20@xmath10 ) .",
    "thus , although iso - sws spectra of rne show similar uir emission features , these authors found clear variations in the 7.7  @xmath0 m uir feature ( see fig .",
    "[ ep : prof_cam ] , right panel ) .",
    "in particular , within vdb133 , the profile shifts from class a@xmath8 to class b@xmath8 in crossing the nebula but in svs3 both components are present with variable strength .",
    "the latter profile is very similar to those in planetary nebulae with a a dominating `` 7.8 ''  @xmath0 m peaking at the shortest wavelengths and is found in regions closer to the illuminating star .",
    "these observations suggest that in all sources variations in the profile and peak position occur on a small spatial scale .",
    "in addition , - in contrast to what analysis of the integrated spectra of sources might suggest - the specific profiles are not unique to certain object types .",
    "in particular , it should be noted that the profiles positioned at longest wavelengths ( class b and type 2 ) are found close to the illuminating star for the three sources ( 2 rne and 1 post - agb star ) discussed above . with increasing distance from the illuminating star ,",
    "the uir feature profiles are more like those found in the integrated spectra of  regions and the ism .",
    "thus , while the average ( or predominant ) profile present within a source does depend on object type , the variations within sources demonstrate that this likely reflects the reaction of the pah family to the very local physical conditions rather than a difference in chemical history .",
    "thus , the profile variations between source types reflect the systematic variations in physical conditions with source type .",
    "the observed variations in the peak position and profile of the various uir features provide direct clues to the characteristics of their carriers and their reaction to a changing environment .",

    "@xcite has proposed a model to explain the observed ( red shaded ) profiles of the 3.3 , 6.2 , and 11.3 @xmath0 m uir features . in this interpretation ,",
    "the red shading comes from the emission from highly vibrationally excited pahs .",
    "in this case , emission from levels above the first excited state become important .",
    "due to the anharmonic nature of the potential well , these feature spacings become smaller the higher up the vibrational ladder one samples and emission between these levels falls progressively to the red producing a red wing reminiscent of the observed wing . in addition",
    ", anharmonic coupling of the emitting mode with other modes also shifts the peak position of the emitting feature to lower energies . integrating over the energy cascade as",
    "the emitting species cools down will then , in a natural way , give rise to a red shaded profile .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have modeled the ir emission spectrum of pahs based upon extensive laboratory studies of the shift in peak position as a function of temperature of the emitter which is a direct measure of the anharmonicity @xcite .",
    "they obtained excellent fits to the observed profiles of the 3.3 , 6.2 and 11.2  @xmath0 m features .",
    "the uir feature profiles in integrated spectra of many sources are very similar , irrespective of the illuminating radiation field .",
    "as exemplified by the model study of @xcite , this indicates that the typical size of the emitting pah is larger in regions which are illuminated by hotter stars .",
    "this coupling between size and the `` color '' of the illuminating radiation field may be a natural consequence of emission from a smooth size distribution of pah species ; that is , the smallest pahs which can survive in a radiation field will depend on the average photon energy in the illuminating fuv field @xcite .",
    "laboratory and theoretical studies show that pah cations have strong cc modes longwards of 6.3  @xmath0 m with the largest pah cations emitting near 6.3  @xmath0 m .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the limit of graphite which shows an emission mode at 6.3  @xmath0 m @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", such species can not explain a peak position as short as 6.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "possibly , this shift in the peak position of the 6.2  @xmath0 m uir feature results from the substitution of n into the internal pah rings in the ism , although the chemical processing involved is presently unclear ( for a detailed discussion , see hudgins & allamandola , these proceedings ) .",
    "another mechanism proposed to explain these variations is a variation in the isotopic ratio , @xmath12c/@xmath13c @xcite .",

    "while all features loosely go together  there are variations in the relative strength of the cc modes in the 69  @xmath0 m range relative to the ch modes at 3.3 and 11.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "specifically , the 3.3  @xmath0 m feature correlates quite well with the 11.2  @xmath0 m feature but they vary by about a factor 5 relative to the 6.2  @xmath0 m feature ( cf . , fig .",
    "[ ep : ratios ] , left panel ) . likewise , while the 6.2  @xmath0 m feature correlates well with the 7.7  @xmath0 m feature , both features vary relative to the ch features .",
    "this can be directly inferred from the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ ep : rich ] .",
    "these variations are directly related to object type ; that is , while post - agb objects and pne are characterized by high i@xmath20/i@xmath14 and i@xmath15/i@xmath14 ratios , ysos , reflection nebulae , and  regions are displaced to lower values .",
    "thus , the relative intensities of the uir features reflect the local physical conditions and/or the local history of the emitting population .",
    "while a dichotomy between the ch and cc modes exists for the four major uir features , this does not extend to all ch out - of - plane bending modes .",
    "both the 11.2 and 12.7  @xmath0 m features corresponds to ch out - of - plane bending modes but their relative strength varies considerably between sources ( fig .",

    "m uir feature ( contours ) and the i@xmath21/i@xmath14 uir feature intensity ratio ( grey scale ) measured in the region s106 with isocam - cvf .",
    "the contours clearly show the central exciting source s106-ir and several large condensations .",
    "the spectrum measured at several positions is also displayed .",
    "the values on the side give the integrated feature ratio of the 7.7 and 6.2  @xmath0 m uir features ( at 1299 and 1613 @xmath7 respectively ) .",

    "@xcite studied  regions in the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "consistent with galactic observations , these authors find correlations between the i@xmath21/i@xmath20 versus i@xmath14/i@xmath20 and the i@xmath25/i@xmath20 versus i@xmath14/i@xmath20 feature strength ratios ( fig .",
    "[ ep : ratios ] , right panel ) .",
    "these plots suggest an interesting segregation between the sources in the different types of environment ( milky way  lmc ",
    "smc ) . furthermore , within the lmc observations , a clear distinction between 30  doradus and non-30  doradus pointings is found .",
    "in fact , a similar fraction of the total pah energy is emitted in the 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath0 m uir features for the galactic and magellanic cloud sources .",
    "in contrast , the fraction of the total pah flux emitted in the 6.2  @xmath0 m feature is larger whereas that emitted in the 11.2  @xmath0 m feature is slightly smaller in the galactic and non-30  doradus sources compared to 30  doradus pointings and the smc source .",
    "we note that the observed variations in the i@xmath21/i@xmath20 and i@xmath14/i@xmath20 ratios parallel a variation in the strength of the 2175   bump in the uv extinction curve @xcite .",
    "the intensity studies outlined above have concentrated on the variations between the _ entire _ integrated uir spectra from various types of sources , revealing interesting variations with source type and environment . as mentioned earlier , the influence of the local physical conditions ( the local radiation field , g@xmath26 ; g@xmath26/n@xmath27 which determines the charge balance ,  )",
    "are better addressed studying variations within a single source or region of the sky .",
    "it is worth noting that the observed intensity variations in the integrated spectra are necessarily a lower limit to the variations when studied at higher angular resolution . in the simplest case ,",
    "this is due to the fact that the integrated spectrum is weighted to the brightest uir emitting regions and any variations in fainter regions are veiled . in the general case , the different emission features might arise from different locations within the object but still give rise to a `` typical '' uir emission spectrum in the integrated spectrum .",
    "as noted above , the existence of variations among the ( minor ) features within a single source were already established earlier from ground - based observations .",
    "the isocam - cvf instrument has allowed to extend the search for such variations to the main cc modes in the 5 - 8  @xmath0 m range .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ep : joblin ] for the bipolar  region , s106",
    "these spectra reveal variations in the relative strength of the 6.2 and 7.7  @xmath0 m features in this source , which these authors link to variations in the molecular composition .",
    "in particular , high i@xmath21/i@xmath14 ratios seem to correspond to clumps of co emission in the molecular cloud where fresh material is exposed to the strong radiation field @xcite .",
    "these variations seem to be accompanied by a variation in the strength of the uir features relative to the local continuum .",
    "such a variation in the strength of the cc uir features relative to the 6  @xmath0 m continuum has also been noted in the  region m17 , on a scale which allowed `` mapping '' using the 14@xmath9@xmath2820@xmath9 aperture of the sws instrument @xcite .",
    "the previously described studies of uir feature ratios changing within sources and from source to source , generally refer to regions of high radiation density .",
    "most studies of regions of _ low _ radiation density , however , conclude that there is a striking lack of variations in the relative intensities of the uir features in these environments of low illumination .",
    "most notable are the studies performed with the _ infrared telescope in space _ ( irts ) and iso of the diffuse ism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* onaka , these proceedings ) and within reflection nebulae @xcite . on the average ,",
    "the relative strength of the uir features in these nebulae is insensitive to the density of incident radiation field ( g@xmath26 )",
    ". however , these uir feature ratios show a large spread around these average , and this spread may reflect real variation rather than noise .",
    "a recent study on three reflection nebulae by @xcite reveals variations in the relative strength of the uir features with g@xmath26/n@xmath27 , which determines the charge balance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* bakes , these proceedings ) .",
    "the observed variations in the relative strength of the various uir features provide direct clues to the characteristics of their carriers and their reaction to a changing environment . while this analysis is not yet complete , thanks to a large and dedicated laboratory and theoretical effort , important information is starting to emerge . here",
    "we will focus on two variations and their implications within the framework of the pah model  the variations in the ratio of the ch to the cc modes feature and the variations in the 11 - 15  @xmath0 m range .",
    "laboratory studies and quantum mechanical calculations have shown that the cc modes are intrinsically weak in neutrals but strong in ions , while this is reversed for neutrals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hudgins & allamandola , these proceedings ) .",
    "hence , the observed variations in the strength of the ch modes relative to the cc modes may thus reflect a variation in the degree of ionization of the pahs in these different environments @xcite .",
    "this is supported by detailed model calculations of the emission spectra of a family of pahs , taking realistic molecular properties into account ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and these proceedings ) .",
    "in this respect , the near constant band - strength ratios for a large range of g@xmath26 under low excitation conditions ( sect .",
    "[ ep : lack ] ) , seem puzzling .",
    "however , @xcite found that the ratios of the infrared emission features do not vary much for g@xmath26/n@xmath27 ( with n@xmath27 the electron density ) , which determines the pah charge and which is also difficult to determine observationally .",
    "in addition , a seemingly constant ratio over a large range of g@xmath26 would imply a concerted change in electron density ( n@xmath27 ) .",
    "such coupled variations in g@xmath26 and n@xmath27 are found in reflection nebulae @xcite .",
    "extensive laboratory studies have shown that the peak wavelength of the ch out - of - plane bending mode depends sensitively on the number of adjacent peripheral c - atoms bonded to a h - atom ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* these proceedings ) .",
    "while the details depend slightly on the charge state of the carrier , the 11.2  @xmath0 m feature can be safely ascribed to lone ch groups ( e.g. no h - atoms attached to adjacent c - atoms ) and the 12.7  @xmath0 m feature belongs to a trio s ( three adjacent c - atoms each with a h attached ) .",
    "now , the lone ch groups are part of long straight edges , while trio s are a characteristic of corners in the molecular structure . variations in the relative strength of the 11.2 to the 12.7  @xmath0 m feature are thus indicative of variations in the molecular structure of the emitting pahs . taking the intrinsic relative strength of these modes into account , possible pah structures , corresponding to the observed interstellar i@xmath20/i@xmath29 feature ratios , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ep : oops ] ( right panel ) .",
    "these variations show that circumstellar pahs associated with pne are characterized by very compact molecular structures .",
    "on the other hand , interstellar pahs have more corners either because they are ( on average ) much smaller or more irregular larger moieties .",
    "since the uir features originate from such a wide variety of different types of sources and the feature carriers encounter many different astronomical environments , they serve as important probes of these very different emission zones .",
    "for example , the presence and strength of the uir features are generally thought to trace star formation on a galactic scale .",
    "since the uir features in extragalactic environments are very similar to those in the galaxy , they also serve as templates to interpret extragalactic observations .",
    "concerning galaxies , they are used as qualitative and quantitative diagnostics of the physical processes powering galactic nuclei ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the uir line - to - continuum ratio is on average an order of magnitude smaller for agns than for starburst galaxies .",
    "this , in combination with emission lines and the dust continuum , is used to distinguish between agns , starburst galaxies and heavily obscured galaxies .",
    "for example , using this reasoning , it is found that ultraluminous ir galaxies ( ulirgs ) are mainly powered by starbursts .",
    "consequently , the strength of the uir features can also probe evolutionary effects in other galaxies on a universal scale .",
    "furthermore , by studying the uir features in low - metallicity environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* galliano et al . , in preparation ) , they may be tracing the early evolutionary state of galaxies as well as probing the elemental evolution in these galaxies . finally , a recent study on the use of the uir features as a quantitative tracer of star formation activity found that the uirs may better be suited as a probe of b stars which dominate the galactic stellar energy budget than as a probe of massive star formation @xcite .",
    "note as well that the uir features do not trace ongoing star formation in highly obscured galaxies .",
    "recent studies on the detailed characteristics of the uir spectra in galaxies also reveal spectral variations similar to those described above for galactic objects .",
    "the uir spectrum of galaxies originates from star forming regions and photo - dissociation regions .",
    "their galactic counterparts exhibit uir features with similar peak positions and profiles , suggesting conditions in these external galaxies are comparable .",
    "although only three galaxies have sufficient s /",
    "n in their iso - sws spectra to be analyzed in detail they show 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 and 8.6  @xmath0 m uir features that are much the same as those associated with  regions .",
    "however , the 11.2  @xmath0 m profile resembles that of some evolved stars , not  regions @xcite . on the other hand , the ( relative ) intensities of the uir features in galactic and extragalactic objects",
    "show clear variations .",
    "indeed , intensities between various  regions in the milky way and in the magellanic clouds vary greatly ( see sect .",
    "[ ep : intens ] ) .",
    "in addition , a study of nearby dwarf galaxies shows a similar range of relative intensities from galaxy to galaxy and within individual galaxies ( * ? ? ? * galliano et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "it is clear that the uir features carry much information on the conditions of the emitting region .",
    "however , exploitation of this tool requires a systematic study of the spectral characteristics as a function of the physical conditions in the emitting regions .",
    "such studies carry the promise of a rich diagnostic tool that may probe , in particular , star formation throughout the universe .",
    "the uir emission features dominate the mid - infrared spectrum of almost all sources - galactic and extragalactic .",
    "the uir spectra in these sources are made up of a rich collection of features . besides the well - known , most intense uir features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.2 and 12.7  @xmath0 m ,",
    "many discrete weaker features , subcomponents and very broad structures are observed .",
    "it is now firmly established that the detailed characteristics ( intensity , peak position , profile ) of the uir features vary from source to source and also spatially within extended sources . in particular ,",
    "the 6.2 and 7.7  @xmath0 m features are noteworthy in this respect ; while the 6.2  @xmath0 m feature peak position varies between 6.256.3  @xmath0 m in many pne , it shifts to 6.2  @xmath0 m in reflection nebulae and  regions .",
    "similar behavior is found for the 7.7  @xmath0 m feature which also consists of two major components , one at 7.6 and one at `` 7.8 ''  @xmath0 m . in this case",
    "their relative strengths vary between objects . in  regions and reflection nebulae",
    ", the 7.6  @xmath0 m feature dominates while for most pne , the `` 7.8 ''  @xmath0 m feature takes over .",
    "remarkably , in some post - agb objects however , this feature has shifted to 8.2  @xmath0 m .",
    "thus the 6.2  @xmath0 m component is correlated with the 7.6  @xmath0 m feature and the 6.256.3  @xmath0 m feature with the `` 7.8 ''  @xmath0 m component .",
    "while the 3.3 and 11.2  @xmath0 m features also show some variations in peak position and profile , these are much less pronounced and not as tightly correlated with the variations in the 6.2 and 7.7  @xmath0 m features .",
    "in addition , while the 3.3 and 11.2  @xmath0 m features correlate tightly , the strength of these features does vary by a factor 5 relative to the 6.2 and 7.7  @xmath0 m features .",
    "nonetheless , the relative strengths of the features on the 11 - 15  @xmath0 m range do vary . these source to source variations in intensity , peak position and profile",
    "are also observed spatially within sources and hence are not unique to certain object types .",
    "thus , these variations trace local conditions and reflect the state of the emitting population .",
    "consequently , these variations are emerging as an integral and important part of the uir studies .",
    "they imply that the emission is carried by a family of related chemical compounds whose detailed physical and/or chemical characteristics vary from source to source and within a given source in reaction to the local physical conditions .    due to their omnipresence , the uir features are now commonly used as tools for probing objects throughout the universe .",
    "they are used as a global diagnostic to reveal the different nature of galaxies , i.e. agn - dominated , starburst - dominated or heavily obscured . in addition , they are a tracer for star formation and the evolutionary effects in galaxies . on top of this ,",
    "the detailed uir spectra which have been observed in a handful of galaxies also show the same significant spectral variations seen in galactic objects .",
    "thus , these uir features also hold the promise to serve as powerful and detailed probes of extragalactic objects .    while in the past",
    ", progress in this area was limited by astronomical observations , iso has relocated the astronomical boundary .",
    "today , the richness in spectra and particularly the plethora of spectral variations from source to source and within sources prompt more questions than can be answered with the current laboratory and theoretical data . there have been many comparisons between the spectra of candidate carriers and the astronomical spectra over the years . due to the large effort put in theoretical and laboratory studies , the agreement with the astronomical spectra are now striking .",
    "nevertheless , thanks to the quality of the new astronomical observations , important differences become apparent which shed further light on the interstellar pah population . simultaneously",
    ", the wealth of variations observed in the uir features puts very strong constraints on the candidate carriers .    as with iso",
    ", sirtf will overwhelm the astronomical community with uir features .",
    "together with current near- and mid - infrared ground - based instruments , it will probe variations in the spectra of the uir features on small spatial scales allowing us to fully constrain the variations possible among different objects and to determine , in detail , the interplay of physical conditions , environment and uir feature characteristics .",
