    "the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite at cern is designed to collide protons with an unprecedented energy of 7  tev and a total stored energy of about 362  mj per beam .",
    "the operation started at a lower - than - design - energy of 3.5  tev in 2010 and 2011 , and in 2012 the energy was raised to 4  tev , with the goal to reach the design parameters in the future .",
    "so far , a maximum of 146  mj has been stored per beam during physics operation .",
    "the design stored energy of the lhc beams is at least a factor of  100 higher than in other hadron machines with superconducting magnets ( hera , tevatron , rhic ) .    because of the high stored energy ,",
    "the lhc beams are highly destructive .",
    "if protons deviate from the wanted trajectory so much that they hit the inside of the vacuum chamber , the induced heating can cause quenches ( a transition to a normalconducting state ) of the superconducting magnets that guide the beam around the ring , and possibly material damage .",
    "even a local beam loss of a tiny fraction of a few @xmath0 of the full beam ( order of @xmath1 protons ) in a magnet could cause a quench .",
    "quenches must be avoided by all means during collider operation , since the recovery is a lengthy process that reduces the available time for collecting physics data .",
    "therefore , all beam losses need to be tightly controlled . for this purpose ,",
    "a multi - stage collimation system has been installed  @xcite , in order to intercept unavoidable beam losses in a safe way .",
    "unlike other high - energy colliders , where the main purpose of collimation is to reduce experimental background , the lhc requires collimation during all stages of operation to protect its elements .    during the first lhc",
    "run 20102013 ( called run  i ) , the lhc collimation system has been very successful in protecting the cold magnets .",
    "no beam - induced quenches have occurred during physics operation with colliding beams , in spite of more than 100  mj being routinely stored over many hours .",
    "the stored energy of the two counter - rotating beams , called b1 and b2 , can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : stored_energy ] for all physics fills in 2011 and 2012 .",
    "even though the lhc collimation system has performed very well so far , the demands on collimation are increasing when the machine performance is pushed beyond the design values ",
    "e.g , the bunch intensity used in run  i was above nominal , and with the number of bunches planned for the next lhc run , the intensity will be higher .",
    "furthermore , future upgrades of the lhc , which are under study , foresee about a factor  2 higher stored beam energies  @xcite .        therefore , in order to ensure that future operation in the lhc will be as smooth and safe as during run  i , it is vital to have a good theoretical understanding of the collimation system as well as the ability to predict local beam losses . for this purpose ,",
    "we simulate the cleaning performance of the lhc collimators using the sixtrack code  @xcite . sixtrack has previously been used at the design stage of the lhc to optimize the performance of the collimators  @xcite .",
    "sixtrack is still used to simulate present and future machine configurations .",
    "therefore , in this article , we compare sixtrack results to measurements of lhc beam losses around the ring using beam - loss monitors ( blms ) .    in order to perform a quantitative comparison with measurements , and to predict critical quantities such as the power density in the superconducting magnets ,",
    "the proton losses produced by sixtrack are used as a starting distribution for a second stage of simulations of the secondary showers , induced by the lost protons .",
    "this is done using the monte - carlo code fluka  @xcite .",
    "at a few important locations , we investigate the quantitative accuracy of the full simulation chain .",
    "first we give an overview of the lhc and its collimation system in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhccoll ] , followed by a description of the simulation tools in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim_setup ] , and of the blm measurements in sec .",
    "[ sec : meas ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2011_sixtrack_sim ] , we present results of sixtrack simulations of the distribution beam losses in the ring .",
    "we study a machine configuration used in 2011 during run  i at 3.5  tev and compare qualitatively with blm measurements , as well as analyze the sensitivity of the simulation result to imperfections and uncertainties in the starting distribution . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2011_fluka ] , we present the fluka shower simulations of a few relevant regions and compare the results of the combined sixtrack and fluka calculation with blm measurements .",
    "the lhc is a 27  km synchrotron that consists of 8  straight sections , called insertion regions ( irs ) and 8  arcs , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhc - layout ] .",
    "thousands of superconducting magnets , many operating at a temperature of 1.9  k , guide the two beams .",
    "each ir houses either one of the four main lhc experiments ( atlas  @xcite , cms  @xcite , alice  @xcite , and lhcb  @xcite ) , where the beams are brought into collision , or other equipment : the accelerating radio - frequency ( rf ) system is installed in ir4 , the beam extraction takes place in ir6 , and injection in ir2 and ir8 . ir3 and ir7 are dedicated to the lhc collimation system . some important parameters of the lhc  both the operational parameters in 2011 and 2012 and the nominal design values are summarized in table  [ tab : machine_cond ] . as can be seen , the design bunch intensity has been surpassed , and the achieved luminosity is almost as high as the design value in spite of a lower energy and fewer bunches .    .proton",
    "running conditions for physics in the lhc in 2011 , 2012 , and for nominal design parameters .",
    "the peak luminosity and @xmath2(the optical @xmath3-function at the collision point ) refer to the high luminosity experiments atlas and cms .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     as it is not practically feasible to repeat the fluka simulation for all imperfection seeds , we assume the same @xmath4 in the imperfect machine as for the perfect one . the distribution of interactions inside the jaws does not change significantly  the main change is in the magnitude of losses . as for the ir7 simulation , we account for all imperfections when taking the average over all seeds .",
    "the simulated ratios of losses at tcts to the tcp , both from sixtrack alone and including the fluka blm response matrix , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ineff_tcts ] for both beams and planes together with the measured average blm ratios from the 2011 loss maps . in the sixtrack simulation of the perfect machine ( magenta lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ineff_tcts ] ) , the measured tct leakage is underestimated by a factor 201000 .",
    "including imperfections increases the relative tct losses by a factor 23 , but does not change significantly the relative loss distribution between the different tct . including",
    "also the fluka blm response matrix causes another increase by a factor 412 on the highest loss location and much more on the blms that are dominated by the shower from other collimators .",
    "as an example , the losses on the tcth in ir1 , during vertical b2 loss maps ( left point of bottom right plot of fig .  [ fig : ineff_tcts ] ) , increase from about 1% of the measured value to 80% when the fluka factor is accounted for . the inclusion of the showering changes the relative loss distribution between the tcts to a shape that is similar to the measurements .",
    "when comparing the combined simulation ( blue lines ) with the measurements ( black lines ) , the loss distribution between the tcts is very well reproduced in all four cases .",
    "we find an average underestimation of the measurements by a factor  1.6 , but the discrepancy is never worse than about a factor  3 as for the ir7 ds . the vertical losses in b2 show a better agreement with a discrepancy of less than 30% . we consider this an excellent result in view of the high complexity of the simulation chain and the many uncertainties .",
    "in order to provide enough luminosity for the particle physics experiments , the lhc accelerator has to store proton beams of unprecedented energy .",
    "these beams are highly destructive and risk quenching the superconducting magnets if not controlled properly .",
    "therefore , the lhc has a collimation system installed that should safely intercept beam losses . to ensure proper protection ,",
    "a thorough understanding is required of the dynamics of the protons intercepted and out - scattered by the collimators .    for this purpose",
    "we use the sixtrack code to track particles through the magnetic fields and the jaws of the collimators over many turns . given an initial assumption on the halo , sixtrack produces a resulting distribution of beam losses around the ring .",
    "the initial conditions have been estimated through measurements and simulations but have nevertheless significant uncertainties .",
    "however , the sixtrack results show that up to an impact depth of about 100  @xmath5 m , a value that is very unlikely to occur in the lhc machine , the initial conditions have a negligible influence on the final loss distribution .",
    "machine imperfections , such as errors on collimator positions and the jaw surface , as well as magnetic errors around the ring , decrease the efficiency of the collimation system . in the studied lhc configurations , they cause the highest peak loss in a superconducting magnet to increase by a factor 4 on average , although the averaged losses in magnets increase only by 4060% .    the simulated distribution of proton losses around the ring shows a very good qualitative agreement with blm signals during provoked losses in the studied 2011 configuration .",
    "the blms intercept secondary shower particles and not directly the beam protons .",
    "therefore , for a quantitative comparison with the lhc measurements , a second simulation step is needed to assess the shower development between the initial losses and the detectors .",
    "we have done this at a few selected locations through a monte carlo simulation with fluka .",
    "we found an average discrepancy between measurement and the combined simulation of about a factor  2 , and never worse than about a factor  3 .",
    "we consider this as an excellent agreement in view of the total losses around the ring spanning over 7  orders of magnitude , the complexity of the simulation chain , and the very large number of unknown imperfections .",
    "our results are based on tracking in total about @xmath6 protons through the fields of the more than 5000  lhc magnets over hundreds of turns .",
    "the tracking was followed by shower calculations , based on a detailed implementation in fluka of several hundred meters of the lhc and the transport of a wealth of radiation components from tev energies down to sub - mev cutoffs . in terms of computational time ,",
    "the simulation campaign is challenging and would not be feasible without parallelization on a cluster .    apart from demonstrating that a complex physical process , such as multi - turn beam losses in the sophisticated lhc machine , can be accurately simulated , the good agreement with measurements gives us confidence that the simulation tools can be used to reliably estimate the beam cleaning performance in other lhc configurations , as well as in other machines , and to conclude on whether the efficiency is sufficient to maximize the availability and performance .",
    "further validations are anyway planned at higher energy during the next lhc run .",
    "our simulation setup is already in use to assess future lhc configurations .",
    "new challenges arise if the proton energy is increased to 7  tev and the total stored beam energy to about 700  mj , as foreseen in the hilumi lhc project  @xcite . in order to make sure that the total beam intensity will not be limited by the collimation cleaning performance and that the collimators can be operated smoothly , several upgrades of the lhc collimation system are under study  @xcite .",
    "the final need for upgrades , such as additional collimators in the ir7 dispersion suppressors , depends on a number of different parameters , such as the achieved beam loss rates and the quench limit of the lhc magnets at higher fields , where significant uncertainties exist .",
    "these parameters will be analyzed in more detail in the next lhc run in order to finalize the upgrade strategy .",
    "we would like to thank b. auchmann , r. de maria , a. lechner and f. schmidt for input and discussions , and the cern op team for the support during the loss maps .",
