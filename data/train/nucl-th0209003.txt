    "information on hyperon - hyperon interactions is not readily available from experiments in free space .",
    "it is almost exclusively limited to the study of strangeness @xmath9=@xmath10 hypernuclear systems , only handful of which have been identified to date .",
    "this information is crucial for extrapolating into multi - strange hadronic matter , for both finite systems and in bulk ( ref . @xcite and references cited therein ) . until recently only three candidates , identified in emulsion experiments @xcite , existed for @xmath11 hypernuclei .",
    "the @xmath11 binding energies deduced from these events indicated that the @xmath11 interaction is strongly attractive in the @xmath12 channel @xcite , in fact considerably stronger than the @xmath2 interaction deduced from single-@xmath13 hypernuclei , and this seemed at odds with the natural expectation borne out in one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models using flavor su(3 ) symmetry or within the naive quark model .",
    "for example , the recent nijmegen soft - core ( nsc97 ) model @xcite yields @xmath14 for the strength @xmath15 of these essentially attractive interactions .",
    "it is gratifying then that the recent unambiguous identification of @xmath16he in the kek hybrid - emulsion experiment e373 @xcite , yielding binding energy substantially lower than that deduced from the older dubious event @xcite , is consistent with a scattering length @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 fm @xcite , indicating a considerably weaker @xmath11 interaction than that specified by @xmath20@xmath18@xmath10 fm @xcite for the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "with such a relatively weak @xmath11 interaction , and since the three - body system @xmath21 is unbound ( comparing it with the unbound @xmath22 system @xcite ) , the question of whether or not the onset of binding in the @xmath9=@xmath10 hadronic sector occurs at @xmath23=@xmath24 becomes highly topical .",
    "the brookhaven ags experiment e906 , studying @xmath25 capture following the @xmath26 reaction on @xmath27be , has recently given evidence for excess pions that defied known single-@xmath13 hypernuclear weak decays and were conjectured as due to the formation of @xmath0h ( @xmath28=0,@xmath29=1@xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "a subsequent theoretical study @xcite of the weak - decay modes available to @xmath0h does not support this conjecture and in our opinion the question of whether or not @xmath0h is particle stable remains experimentally open . if it is confirmed in a future extension of e906 or of a related experiment , then this four - body system @xmath1 would play as a fundamental role for studying theoretically the hyperon - hyperon forces as the @xmath31h bound state of the three - body system @xmath4 has played for studying theoretically the hyperon - nucleon forces ( ref . @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "our aim in this letter is to search theoretically for a possible @xmath0h bound state by solving the appropriate faddeev - yakubovsky equations for the four - body system @xmath1 , particularly for @xmath11 interactions which reproduce the recently deduced binding energy of @xmath16he @xcite .",
    "this is the first ever systematic faddeev - yakubovsky calculation done for the @xmath23=@xmath24 , @xmath9=@xmath10 problem .",
    "it has the virtue of taking into account properly _ all _ the rearrangement channels ( or equivalently clusters ) which the @xmath32 system may be split into .",
    "we note that a @xmath31h bound state does not necessarily imply , for attractive @xmath5 interactions , that @xmath0h is particle stable .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath11 interaction potentials used as input were of a three - range gaussian @xmath33-wave form similar to that used by hiyama _",

    "the @xmath11 interaction , respecting the pauli principle , is limited to the singlet @xmath33-wave channel .",
    "the short - range term ( @xmath37=@xmath38 ) provides for a strong soft - core repulsion and the long - range term ( @xmath37=@xmath39 ) for attraction .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 , which controls the strength of the mid - range attractive term ( @xmath37=@xmath41 ) , was chosen such that the potential ( [ eq : obe ] ) reproduces the scattering length and the effective range for a given model as close as possible .",
    "its appropriate values for @xmath2 are listed in table [ 2 ] for two versions of model nsc97 @xcite considered realistic ones .",
    "for @xmath11 we listed the value which was determined in ref .",
    "@xcite to reproduce the recently reported @xmath8 @xcite . also listed are the values of the scattering lengths for these @xmath2 and @xmath11 model interactions which obviously satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : v1 ] ) . for the @xmath42 triplet interaction we multiplied the @xmath2 potential ( [ eq : obe ] ) by a factor @xmath43 , using @xmath44 , in order to reproduce the @xmath45 low - energy scattering parameters in this channel plus the binding energy of the deuteron .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     focusing on the @xmath1 faddeev - yakubovsky calculation we note that for two identical hyperons and two essentially identical nucleons ( upon introducing isospin ) , as appropriate to the @xmath28=@xmath48 , @xmath49=@xmath7 ground state of @xmath50h , the 18 faddeev - yakubovsky components which satisfy coupled equations reduce to seven independent components , in close analogy to the faddeev - yakubovsky equations discussed in our recent work @xcite for the @xmath51 model of @xmath52be .",
    "six rearrangement channels are involved in our @xmath33-wave calculation for @xmath50h : @xmath53 for 3 + 1 breakup clusters , and @xmath54 with @xmath55=@xmath56+@xmath57 and @xmath58 for 2 + 2 breakup clusters .",
    "we find invariably that the three rearrangement channels in which the two nucleons belong to the same @xmath59-like cluster dominate in actual calculations .",
    "this observation , apparently , could justify the use of a @xmath6 model for @xmath50h .",
    "however , as we shall see and discuss below , the results of using such a three - body model differ radically from those of the full four - body faddeev - yakubovsky calculations which retain the proton and neutron as dynamically independent entities .",
    "( @xmath9=1/2 ) , @xmath6 and @xmath1 ( @xmath9=1 ) systems with respect to the number @xmath60 of basis functions .",
    "values of @xmath61 fm for @xmath1 and @xmath4 , and @xmath62 fm for @xmath6 were used .",
    "the @xmath11 interaction is due to table [ 2].,height=257 ]",
    "using the @xmath11 interaction which reproduces @xmath63he ) ( see table [ 2 ] ) our calculations yield no bound state for the @xmath1 system , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : be ] by the location of the ` @xmath1 ' curve _ above _ the horizontal straight line marking the ` @xmath64 threshold ' @xcite .",
    "in fact our faddeev - yakubovsky calculations exhibit little sensitivity to the strength of the @xmath11 interaction over a wide range , including much stronger @xmath11 interactions such as nd and esc00 @xcite , the latter one reproducing the ( excessive ) @xmath65 value reported for the ` old ' @xmath66he event @xcite . for these @xmath11 interactions",
    "we get a bound @xmath50h only if the @xmath2 interaction is made considerably stronger , by as much as 40% . with four @xmath2 pairwise interactions out of a total of six",
    ", the strength of the @xmath2 interaction ( here about half of that for @xmath45 binding the deuteron ) plays a major role in the four - body @xmath1 problem . in passing we remark that this is also apparent from the bounds derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the four - body bound - state problem . put differently , we know of no few - body theorem that would imply , for essentially attractive @xmath11 interactions and for a _ non static _ nuclear core @xmath59 ( made out of @xmath42 in the present case ) , the existence of a @xmath6 bound state provided that @xmath67 is bound .",
    "it is a remarkable outcome of the complete faddeev - yakubovsky scheme for four particles that such a natural expectation can be refuted by a specific calculation .",
    "however , for a _ static _ nuclear core @xmath59 , and disregarding inessential complications due to spin , a two - body @xmath67 bound state does imply binding for the three - body @xmath6 system @xcite . a discussion of the formal relationship between these four - body and three - body models which do not share a common hamiltonian is deferred to a subsequent publication .",
    "our @xmath6 model for @xmath50h uses the @xmath11 interaction marked ` @xmath66he ' in table [ 2 ] plus @xmath67 interactions that reproduce the low - energy parameters of the @xmath4 faddeev calculation specified in table [ 3 ] .",
    "the dependence on the functional form chosen for the interpolating @xmath67 interaction potentials proved relatively mild .",
    "the results of such a @xmath6 three - body faddeev calculation using model nsc97f for the underlying @xmath2 interaction are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : be ] as function of the number @xmath60 of basis functions used in the expansion of the faddeev components .",
    "the asymptote of the curve marked ` @xmath6 ' is now located _ below _ the horizontal straight line for the ` @xmath64 threshold ' , so @xmath50h is particle stable .",
    "the figure may suggest that a @xmath13 in @xmath50h is less bound , by about 0.1 mev , than a @xmath13 in @xmath68 ( which in model nsc97f is bound by about 0.2 mev ) .",
    "however , the @xmath69 spin - averaged effective @xmath70 in @xmath50h is only @xmath71 mev and , since @xmath72 mev , we have @xmath73 which is equivalent to stating loosely that the second @xmath13 in @xmath50h is bound even more strongly than the first one .",
    "this holds also for model nsc97e and it is a general property of the faddeev calculation @xcite .     calculated in a three - body @xmath6 model as function of the scattering length @xmath17 , for two exponential @xmath67 potentials corresponding to versions @xmath74 and @xmath75 in table [ 3 ] .",
    "the solid squares correspond to the ` @xmath66he ' @xmath11 interaction of table [ 2 ] .",

    "[ fig : expf ] we show @xmath65 values calculated for @xmath50h within this @xmath6 faddeev model as function of @xmath76 ( quantified by the value of the scattering length @xmath17 ) for two exponential @xmath67 potentials corresponding to versions @xmath74 and @xmath75 of model nsc97 ( see table [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the roughly linear increase of @xmath65 holds generally in three - body @xmath77 models ( @xmath78 standing for a cluster ) over a wide range of values for @xmath76 @xcite . for values",
    "@xmath79 mev , @xmath50h becomes unstable against emitting a @xmath13 .",
    "this onset of particle stability for @xmath50h requires a minimum strength for the @xmath11 interaction which is satisfied for our choice of @xmath66he as a normalizing datum .",
    "it is also seen from the figure that the uncertainty in the location of @xmath80 bears serious consequences for the predicted binding of @xmath50h ; this is a particularly strong effect as the @xmath81 state crosses the @xmath82 threshold .",
    "yet , we would like to emphasize that no such sensitivity emerges within a genuine four - body model calculation which does not bind @xmath50h as long as the @xmath2 interaction is of the size constrained by single-@xmath13 hypernuclear phenomenology .",
    "in cluster models of the type @xmath83 and @xmath84 for heavier @xmath11 hypernuclei , where the nuclear - core cluster @xmath78=@xmath85+@xmath86 is made out of subclusters @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the @xmath87 interaction ( normally producing bound states ) is considerably stronger than for @xmath2 .",
    "our experience with faddeev - yakubovsky calculations for @xmath52be @xcite , viewed as a four - body @xmath51 system , is that the relationship between the three - body and four - body models is then opposite to that found here for @xmath50h : the @xmath84 calculation under similar conditions provides _ higher _ binding than the @xmath83 calculation yields .",
    "the mechanism behind it is the attraction induced by the @xmath88-@xmath89 , @xmath90-@xmath86 , @xmath85-@xmath91 four - body rearrangement channels which include bound states that have no room for in the three - body @xmath83 model .",
    "the binding energy calculated within the four - body model increases then ` normally ' with @xmath76 .    in conclusion , we have provided a first four - body faddeev - yakubovsky calculation for @xmath50h using @xmath45 and @xmath2 interaction potentials that fit the available data on the relevant subsystems , including the binding energy of @xmath92h .",
    "no bound state is obtained for @xmath50h over a wide range of @xmath11 interaction strengths , including that normalized to reproduce the binding energy of @xmath66he .",
    "we have traced the origin of this non binding as due to the relatively weak @xmath2 interaction .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the results of a ` reasonable ' three - body @xmath6 faddeev calculation that binds @xmath50h provided the @xmath11 interaction is not too weak , say with @xmath93 fm .",
