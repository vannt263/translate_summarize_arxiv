    "since its discovery in 2003 @xcite , the @xmath4 charmonium is subject of many experimental and theoretical efforts aimed at disclosing its nature  for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "the most recent data on the mass of the @xmath3 is @xcite m_x=(3871.850.27(stat)0.19(syst ) )  , [ xmass ] with a width of @xmath5 .",
    "however , the problem of the quantum numbers for the @xmath3 is not fully resolved yet : while the analysis of the @xmath6 decay mode of the @xmath4 yields either @xmath2 or @xmath7 quantum numbers @xcite , the recent analysis of the @xmath8 mode seems to favour the @xmath7 assignment @xcite , though the @xmath2 option is not excluded .",
    "this question is clearly very central , for the most promising explanations for the @xmath3 in the @xmath9-wave @xmath10 molecule model @xcite as well as in the coupled - channel model @xcite require the quantum numbers @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the @xmath3 can not be a naive @xmath11 @xmath7 state , for its large branching fraction for the @xmath12 mode  @xcite is not compatible with the quark - model estimates for the @xmath7 charmonium  @xcite .",
    "so , for the @xmath7 quantum numbers , very exotic explanations for the @xmath3 would have to be invoked .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to perform a combined analysis of the data on the @xmath13 and @xmath14 mass distribution in the @xmath6 and @xmath8 mode , respectively .",
    "we find that the @xmath9-wave amplitudes from the decay of a @xmath2 state provide a better overall description of the data than the @xmath15-wave ones from the @xmath7 , especially when the parameter range is restricted to realistic values .",
    "we conclude then that the existing data favour @xmath2 quantum numbers of the @xmath3 , however , improved data in the @xmath8 mode are necessary to allow for definite conclusions regarding the @xmath3 quantum  numbers .",
    "recently belle announced @xcite the updated results of the measurements for the reaction @xmath16 : _",
    "2^+&=&[8.610.82(stat)0.52(syst)]10 ^ -6 , + b_2 ^ 0&=&[4.31.2(stat)0.4(syst)]10 ^ -6 , for the charged @xmath17 and neutral @xmath18 mode , respectively , with @xmath19 being the product branching fraction @xmath20 in the corresponding mode .",
    "the number of events in the background - subtracted combined distribution is @xmath21 for the decay @xmath22 babar reports @xcite _",
    "3^+&=&[0.60.2(stat)0.1(syst)]10 ^ -5 , + b_3 ^ 0&=&[0.60.3(stat)0.1(syst)]10 ^ -5 , for the charged mode @xmath23 and for the neutral mode @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "similarly to the two - pion case above , @xmath25 stands for the product branching fraction @xmath26 in the corresponding mode .",
    "the number of events in the combined distribution is n^sig+bg_3=34.06.6,n_3^bg=8.91.0 , and we assume a flat background .",
    "note , the spectrum reported in @xcite and used below appears not to be efficiency corrected . however , since only the shape of this spectrum plays a role for the analysis ( see number - of - event distributions ( [ n23pi ] ) below ) and we can reproduce the theoretical spectra of @xcite , which have the efficiency of the detector convoluted in via a monte carlo simulation , the invariant mass dependence of the efficiency corrections is expected to be mild and therefore should not affect our analysis significantly .",
    "thus the updated ratio of branchings reads @xcite = = 0.80.3 .",
    "[ brratio ] in our analysis we use the ratio ( [ brratio ] ) as well as n_2=196,n_3=25.1 , [ bandn ] and he corresponding bin sizes are @xmath27  mev and @xmath28  mev .",
    "as in previous analyses , we assume that the two - pion final state is mediated by the @xmath31 in the intermediate state , while the three - pion final state is mediated by the @xmath32 . it was shown in @xcite that the description of the @xmath6 spectrum with the @xmath7 assumption is improved drastically if the isospin - violating @xmath31-@xmath32 mixing is taken into account",
    ". theoretical issues of the @xmath31-@xmath32 mixing are discussed , for example , in @xcite . here",
    "we include this effect with the help of the prescription used in @xcite , where the transition amplitude is described by the real parameter @xmath33 .",
    "thus , the amplitudes for the decays @xmath34 and @xmath35 take the form & & a_2=a_xj / g_a_2 + & & + a_xj / g_g_a_2 , + & & a_3=a_xj / g_a_3 + & & + a_xj / g_g_a_3 , where the vector meson propagators are g_v^-1=m_v^2-m^2-im_v_v(m),v= , , with @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) being the @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) invariant mass in the @xmath6 ( @xmath8 ) final state .",
    "masses of the vector mesons used below are @xcite @xmath38 the complex mixing amplitude multiplying the @xmath32 propagator used , for example , in @xcite to analyse the two - pion spectrum , in our notation reads as @xmath39 ; in particular we reproduce naturally the phase of 95@xmath40 quoted in @xcite . note , as we shall only study the invariant mass distributions of the two final states",
    ", we do not need to keep explicitly the vector nature of the intermediate states .",
    "for the `` running '' @xmath31 meson width we use @xmath41 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , with @xmath44  gev@xmath45 and with the nominal @xmath31 meson width @xmath46  mev .    for the @xmath32 meson `` running '' width ( the nominal width being @xmath47  mev ) , the @xmath48 and @xmath49 decay modes are summed , with the branchings ( 3)=89.1%,()=8.28% .    in particular ,",
    "( m)=_^(0)^3 , while , for the @xmath50 , we resort to the expressions derived in @xcite , with a reduced contact term which provides the correct nominal value of the @xmath51 decay width  @xcite .",
    "the transition amplitudes for the decays @xmath52 are parameterised in the standard way , namely , a_xj / v = g_xvf_lx(p ) , with the blatt - weisskopf `` barrier factor '' f_0x(p)=1 ,  f_1x(p)=(1+r^2 p^2)^-1/2 , for the @xmath2 and @xmath7 assignment , respectively . here",
    "@xmath53 denotes the @xmath54 momentum in the @xmath3 rest frame .",
    "the `` radius '' @xmath55 is not well understood .",
    "if one associates it with the size of the @xmath56 vertex , it might be related to the range of force . in the quark model",
    "this radius is @xmath57 .",
    "this is also in line with the inverse mass of the lightest exchange particle allowed between @xmath54 and @xmath58 , namely , @xmath59 . on the other hand ,",
    "a larger value @xmath60  gev@xmath45 is used in the experimental analysis of @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the analysis presented below we use both values @xmath61 gev@xmath45 as well as @xmath60 gev@xmath45 , keeping in mind that smaller values of @xmath55 are preferred by phenomenology .    the theoretical invariant mass distributions for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 final state take the form : = bm__2 p^2l+1f_lx^2(p)|r_xg_+g_g_|^2 , + [ br23pi ] + = bm__3 p^2l+1f_lx^2(p)|g_+r_x g_g_|^2,where @xmath62 and the parameter @xmath63 absorbs the details of the short - ranged dynamics of the @xmath3 production .",
    "the theoretical number - of - event distributions read n_2(m)= , + [ n23pi ] + n_3(m)=.    the @xmath31-@xmath32 mixing parameter @xmath64 is extracted from the @xmath65 decay width ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the corresponding amplitude reads a_2=g_a_2 , and we find that 3.410 ^ -3  ^2 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the number - of - event distributions ( [ n23pi ] ) possess 3 free parameters : the `` barrier '' factor @xmath55 , the ratio of couplings @xmath67 and the overall normalisation parameter @xmath63 .",
    "as outlined above , we perform the analysis for two values of @xmath55 , namely , the preferred value of 1 gev@xmath45 and a significantly larger value of 5 gev@xmath45 used in earlier analyses . since the normalisation factor @xmath63 drops out from the ratio of the two branchings , we extract the ratio @xmath67 directly from the integrated data , that is from the relation ( dm)/(dm).=b_3/b_2 , where the value of the ratio on the right - hand side is fixed by eq .",
    "( [ brratio ] ) , and in the integration above we have cut off the @xmath29 invariant mass at 400 mev , as in @xcite , and the @xmath30 invariant mass at 740 mev , as in @xcite .",
    "therefore the norm @xmath63 is our only fitting parameter which governs the overall strength of the signal in both channels simultaneously , while the shape of the curves is fully determined from other sources .    in table",
    "[ t1 ] , we list the parameters of the 3 combined fits to the data , found for the 2 values of the blatt - weisskopf parameter @xmath55 . the corresponding line shapes and the result of the integration in bins are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "one can see from table  [ t1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the best overall description of the data for the two channels under consideration is provided by the @xmath9-wave fit .",
    "the @xmath15-wave fit is capable to provide the description of the data of a comparable ( however somewhat lower ) quality , only for large values of the blatt - weisskopf parameter @xmath55 , @xmath60  gev@xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath15-wave fit becomes poorer when the blatt - weisskopf parameter is decreased , and for values of @xmath55 of order 1  gev@xmath45 , the quality of the @xmath15-wave fit is unsatisfactory , which is the result of a very poor description of the two - pion spectrum  see the dashed ( green ) curve in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . varying the ratio of branchings @xmath68 around its central value within the experimental uncertainty interval",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ brratio ] ) ] leads only to minor changes in the fits and does not affect the conclusions .",
    "since no charged partners of the @xmath4 are observed experimentally , it is supposed to be ( predominantly ) an isoscalar .",
    "then the ratio @xmath62 measures the strength of the isospin violation in the @xmath69 decay vertex . as discussed above",
    ", this ratio is extracted directly from the data on the ratio of the branchings ( [ brratio ] ) .    an isospin - violating observable for a compact charmonium",
    "is the ratio of the branching fractions for the @xmath70 decays into @xmath71 and @xmath72 final states as r_(2s)== 0.03 , [ rcharm ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the center - of - mass momenta of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , and the @xmath70 branching fractions are taken from @xcite . however , since here also the denominator violates a symmetry , namely , su(3 ) , and there might be significant meson - loop contributions @xcite , the estimate ( [ rcharm ] ) is to be regarded as a conservative upper bound for the isospin violation strength for compact charmonia .",
    "in contrast to this , in the @xmath9-wave molecular picture for the @xmath3 , isospin violation is enhanced significantly compared to the strength ( [ rcharm ] ) for it proceeds via intermediate @xmath77 states and is therefore driven by the mass difference @xmath78  mev of the neutral and charged @xmath77 threshold  see , for example , @xcite .",
    "an order - of - magnitude estimate is provided by the expression r_x^mol~|| ~ ~0.13 , [ rmol ] where @xmath79 is the @xmath80 meson mass , while @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the amplitudes corresponding to loop diagrams with neutral and charged @xmath10 intermediate states , respectively , evaluated at the @xmath3 mass .",
    "they are composed of two terms , the strongly channel - dependent analytic continuation of the unitarity cut , proportional to the typical momentum of the meson pair , and the weakly channel - dependent principle value term , whose size is identified with the inverse range of forces of order of 1  gev ( see above ) .",
    "this estimate is within a factor of 2 consistent with the value @xmath83 found from our @xmath9-wave fit  see table  [ t1 ] .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath3 has the quantum numbers @xmath7 , one should expect the isospin violation in the @xmath3 wave function to be of the natural charmonium size , and thus of the order of @xmath84see discussion below eq .",
    "( [ rcharm ] ) , since the @xmath10 loop effects are suppressed by the additional centrifugal barrier : the estimate analogous to eq .",
    "( [ rmol ] ) now reads @xmath85 .",
    "thus , for the state with the quantum numbers @xmath7 , one expects values of at most @xmath86 , that are significantly smaller than those following from the data ( see table  [ t1 ] ) .",
    "one is led to conclude therefore that for @xmath87 , needed for the quantum numbers @xmath7 to be consistent with the data on the @xmath3 decays , a new , yet unknown , isospin violation mechanism would have to be invoked .",
    "we conclude therefore that , although the present quality of the data in the @xmath35 channel is not sufficient to draw a definite conclusion concerning the quantum numbers of the @xmath4 , the combined analysis of the existing two- and three - pion spectra favours the @xmath9-wave fit , related to the @xmath2 assignment for the @xmath4 , over the @xmath15-wave fit , related to the @xmath7 assignment .",
    "we notice that an acceptable @xmath15-wave fit calls for a large range parameter in the blatt - weisskopf form factor which meets certain difficulties with its phenomenological interpretation . in addition , while the value @xmath62 can be understood theoretically for the @xmath2 assignment , the value extracted for the @xmath7 assignment is too large to be explained from known mechanisms of the isospin violation .",
