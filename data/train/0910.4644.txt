    "near - threshold production of the unstable particles ( ups ) is the most suitable process to observe the finite - width effects ( fwes ) .",

    "it equals to the sum of masses of the final state particles .",
    "the measurements of boson - pair production at the threshold ( e.g. lep ii experiments ) have provided us with an important information about the masses of bosons and non - abelian triple gauge - boson couplings . to extract the exact information from the boson - pair production we have to calculate the radiative corrections ( rcs ) , which give a noticeable contribution to the corresponding cross - section .",

    "was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the cross - section of the process @xmath7 was given . at the tree level , this process is described by two @xmath8-channel diagrams with @xmath9-exchange and one @xmath10-channel diagram with @xmath11-exchange .",
    "the complete @xmath4 radiative corrections , comprising the virtual one - loop corrections and real - photon bremsstrahlung , were calculated and represented in refs .",

    "@xcite .    in description of the @xmath6- and @xmath12-pairs production we should take into consideration the fact that the gauge bosons are not stable particles and the real process is not @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this is only an approximation with a level of goodness , which may depend on several factors , while the real process is @xmath14 .",
    "there are many papers devoted to comprehensive analysis and description of all possible processes with the four - fermion final states .",
    "because of a large number of diagrams , describing these processes , the classification scheme was applied in refs .",
    "@xcite  @xcite .",
    "the possible processes are divided into three classes : charge current ( cc ) , neutral current ( nc ) and mixed current ( mix ) .",
    "born processes @xmath13 are designated as cc03 and nc02 , which correspond to three charge current and two neutral current diagrams . according to this classification the off - shell @xmath6-pair production with consequent @xmath6 decay",
    "can be described in the framework of the double - pole approximation ( dpa ) @xcite  @xcite .",

    "because of complexity of the problem , some approximation schemes are practically applied , namely , semi - analytical approximation ( saa ) @xcite , improved born approximation @xcite , an asymptotic expansion of the cross - section in powers of the coupling constant @xcite , fermion - loop scheme , etc .",
    "( see , introduction in refs .",
    "there are many computer tools of calculations , for instance , monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations , such as racoonww @xcite and yfsww @xcite .",
    "all above mentioned methods are based on the traditional quantum field theory of unstable particles @xcite . at the same time",
    ", there are some alternative approaches for description of the ups such as the effective theory of up @xcite  @xcite , modified perturbation theory @xcite , and the model of ups with smeared mass @xcite .",
    "now , we consider the effects of finite ( large ) width of the bosons @xmath12 and @xmath6 , which occur in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "similar approach was used for the study of @xmath7 in ref .",
    "the main feature of the fwes is the `` smearing '' ( fuzzing ) of the threshold . in the standard treatment , this effect is described by taking into account all virtual states of up , i.e. its off - shellness .",
    "so , the cross - section @xmath18 is defined as the cross - section of exclusive four - fermion production @xmath19 in dpa .",
    "analogous definitions can be applied also in the case of another boson - pair production processes ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "such a description is usually realized with the help of the dressed propagators of ups .    in this paper , we describe fwes in the near - threshold boson - pair production within the framework of the model of ups with smeared masses @xcite .",
    "the conception of the mass smearing as the main element of the model is tested by comparison of its predictions with experimental data on the corresponding cross - sections . in the second section ,",
    "we consider the formulation of the mass - smearing conception and give a short description of the model . in section 3",
    ", we present the formalism of the model which is used for the description of the processes with up in the initial or final state . calculation strategy and results are considered in the fourth and fifth sections .",
    "the main conclusion of our work is the statement that the mass - smearing conception is in the good agreement with the experimental data on the near - threshold boson - pair production .",
    "moreover , this approach leads to a simple and transparent formalism for description of the processes with participation of unstable particles .",
    "the model is based on the time - energy uncertainty relation ( ur ) . despite of the formal universality ,",
    "various urs have different physical nature .",
    "this issue has been discussed all the time starting from heisenberg formulation of the uncertainty principle ( see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite  @xcite and references therein ) . here",
    ", we shortly consider this problem in close analogy with ref .",

    "was suggested in ref .",
    "the time - dependent wave function of up in the rest frame was written in terms of its fourier transform as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the decay width of up .",
    "the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) may be interpreted as a mass distribution with a spread , @xmath37 , related to the mean life @xmath38 by the uncertainty relation : @xmath39    thus , from the time - energy ur ( [ 2.4 ] ) for the unstable quantum system , it follows the conception of up mass smearing which is described by ur ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "implicit ( non - direct ) account of the time - energy uncertainty relation , or instability , is usually performed by using the complex pole in @xmath40-matrix or propagator which describes up in an intermediate state .",
    "explicit account of this relation is realized in the description of up in the final or initial state with the help of the mass - smearing effect . from eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) it follows that this effect is noticeable when up has a relatively large width .",
    "previously , it was observed in various fields of particle physics , in particular , in decay processes with large - width up participation @xcite , in the boson - pair production @xcite , and in the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "now , let us consider the main ingredients of the model of smeared - mass unstable particles @xcite .",
    "the field function of the up can be considered as a superposition of the standard ones , i.e. @xmath41 where @xmath42 is some weight function , and the spectral component @xmath43 has the standard form in the case of fixed mass @xmath44 @xmath45    using representation ( [ 2.8 ] ) we suppose that for an arbitrary mass parameter @xmath46 the spectral component of the field @xmath43 satisfies the klein - gordon equation @xmath47 in another words , within the framework of the model , up is on the smeared mass shell characterized by an arbitrary mass parameter @xmath48 .    the third element of the model is the commutation relations : @xmath49_{\\pm }   = \\delta(\\mu-\\mu ' ) \\delta(\\bar{k}-\\bar{q})\\delta_{ab},\\ ] ] the presence of additional @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ 2.10 ] ) means an assumption , namely , creation and annihilation of the unstable particles with various masses do not interfere .",
    "the expressions ( [ 2.7 ] )  ( [ 2.10 ] ) are the main elements of the model under consideration .",
    "the model green function has a spectral form .",
    "in particular , for the case of scalar up it reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is defined in a standard way for the fixed @xmath53 , and @xmath54 is the probability density of the mass parameter @xmath46 . from the definition ( [ 2.7 ] ) and commutation relations ( [ 2.10 ] ) it follows that the amplitude of the process with up in a final or initial state takes the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the amplitude at fixed @xmath46 which is defined in a standard way .",
    "determination of the weight function @xmath42 or corresponding probability density @xmath57 can be done with the help of various methods ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . here",
    "we consider the definition of @xmath54 which leads to the factorisation property of the amplitude @xcite .",
    "we match the model propagator of scalar up to the standard dressed one as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the conventional polarisation function .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the correspondence ( [ 2.13 ] ) leads to the following prescription @xmath60 ^ 2+[\\mathrm{im}\\,\\pi(\\mu)]^2}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 .",
    "the relations between scalar , vector and spinor green functions following from equations of motion together with definition ( [ 2.14 ] ) lead to the correspondences @xmath62 and @xmath63 note that in eq .",
    "( [ 2.16 ] ) we have done the exchange @xmath64 .",
    "the correspondences ( [ 2.13 ] )  ( [ 2.16 ] ) define some effective theory of ups . in this theory , the structure of numerators in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.15 ] ) and ( [ 2.16 ] ) differs from the standard one .",
    "the correspondence between the standard and model expressions in the cases of vector ( in unitary gauge ) and spinor up is given by transition @xmath65 , where @xmath66 : @xmath67 the unstable particles in initial or final states are described by the following polarisation matrices @xmath68 the coincidence of expressions for numerators of propagators ( [ 2.17 ] ) and polarisation matrices ( [ 2.18 ] ) leads to the effect of exact factorisation ( see section 3 ) , while the standard propagators lead to approximate factorisation .",
    "this important property of the model directly leads to the convolution formula for the decay rates @xcite and universal factorized formula for the cross - sections @xcite .",

    "@xmath77 , when there is one up in a final state , the model cross - section at the tree level has a convolution form : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is defined in a standard way , @xmath80 is variable mass of @xmath12-boson and @xmath81 is defined by eq .",

    "the limits of integrations in eqs .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) will be given in the next section .",
    "in the framework of the standard treatment the expressions ( [ 3.2 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) can be derived as approximations in convolution method ( cm ) and semi - analytical approach ( saa ) . in the framework of the model",
    "these expressions are direct consequences of model approach ( i.e. of the mass - smearing effect ) . moreover , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the convolution formula for the factorized cross - section can be strictly derived for the processes with up in an intermediate state .",
    "this result is caused by the effect of exact factorisation of the total process , for instance , @xmath86 .",
    "such an effect makes it possible to divide the full process into two stages  the scattering and decay of the products .",
    "note that such a separation is exact in the framework of the model under consideration , while in the standard treatment it is considered as an approximation ( narrow - width approximation ) .",
    "now , we illustrate the effect of the threshold smearing in the process @xmath87 , as an example . in fig .  1 we present the born cross - section @xmath18 in the standard approach with fixed mass @xmath88 ( dashed line ) and in the up model with smeared mass ( solid line ) .",
    "one can see a transparent effect of the threshold smearing at @xmath89 , which gradually disappears with the increasing of energy .",
    "this effect has close analogy with `` standard smearing of threshold '' which caused by virtual states of @xmath12-bosons in the total process @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "we show also lep2 experimental data on the cross - section with corresponding error bars . from comparison with these data",
    "it follows that the smearing effect improves theoretical description , however we need to take into account large radiative corrections ( see the next section ) .",
    "in this section we give the expressions for tree - level cross - sections and consider the strategy of radiative corrections ( rc ) accounting in the framework of the considering model . as it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the model description of up is equivalent to some effective theory of up , which includes the self - energy type rcs in all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , the up is the nonperturbative object in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "so , the traditional program of rcs calculation is not valid in the framework of the model .",
    "we have no well defined set of the diagrams which is gauge invariant and renormalized .",
    "the model of ups @xcite is effective and not a gauge one , and we have no any rigid criteria for definition of such a set .",
    "so , we follow the strategy which is based on the simple phenomenology and was successfully applied earlier @xcite . for the preliminary analysis of the model applicability in description of the boson - pair production",
    "we restrict ourselves by taking into account of the major part of rcs which is common for all processes under consideration .",
    "this is so - called initial state radiation ( isr ) correction which includes hard and soft real and virtual @xmath91-radiation .",
    "it is needed for compensation of ir divergences .",
    "we do not take into account any corrections to the final states of ups because of the effective nature of these states in the framework of the model .",
    "we use the effective couplings @xmath92 and @xmath93 in the vertex with the final @xmath94- and @xmath91-states and @xmath95 in the calculations of rcs .",
    "so , the principal part of the vertex corrections is effectively included into the coupling , and the low - energy behavior of the bremsstrahlung and radiative corrections to the initial states is taken into consideration .",
    "the set of corrections , caused by the final state interactions in the @xmath8-channel diagrams is included into the effective coupling @xmath96 .",
    "the principal part of the so - called coulomb singularity contributions , which were considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , can be also absorbed by the effective coupling .",
    "the one - loop calculation shows that this correction gives from @xmath97 at the threshold to 1.8% at 190 gev @xcite , while the total change of the effective coupling @xmath96 with respect to @xmath98 is about @xmath99 . in the calculation",
    "we explicitly take into account the @xmath4 corrections including soft and hard bremsstrahlung , which are not described by the model and by the effective coupling .",
    "the real and virtual electromagnetic radiation should enter into the set of these rcs and mutually compensates the total ir divergences .",
    "the program of rcs calculations , which is similar to above discussed one , was fulfilled in the series of papers ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) for the case of the on - shell @xmath6-pair production ( the limit of fixed masses @xmath100 ) .",
    "the analytical expression for these corrections is represented in the compact and convenient form in ref .",
    "we generalized this expression to the case of smeared - shell boson - pair production , that is for arbitrary values of mass parameters @xmath101 , and applied it in our calculations .",
