    "noncollinear magnetism , i.e. magnetic ordering where the local magnetic moments are not parallel or antiparallel to a global direction , exists in a variety of systems , for example , in topologically frustrated antiferromagnets , in spiral spin - density waves and spin - spiral states .",
    "these types of orderings can be called interatomic noncollinear magnetism since the different atomic moments are noncollinear .",
    "generally , noncollinear configurations occur more easily in a low symmetry or a disordered magnetic system.@xcite thus small clusters , which have less symmetry constraints than the bulk , are likely candidates for noncollinear structures . indeed , as a consequence of spin - spiral ground state of fcc fe ( refs . 3 and 4 ) and spin density wave ground state of bcc cr ( ref .",
    "5 ) , the small fe@xmath0 and cr@xmath0 clusters were found to have noncollinear magnetic structures.@xcite    from the structural and magnetic point of view , manganese is one of the most complex of all metals and has attracted considerable attention .",
    "the electronic configuration in a mn atom is 4@xmath6 3@xmath7 and consequently mn atoms have high magnetic moments of 5 @xmath8 .",
    "high 4@xmath63@xmath9 @xmath10 4@xmath113@xmath12 promotion energy means that mn atoms do not bind strongly when they are brought together to form a cluster or a bulk solid .",
    "the most stable polymorph , @xmath13mn , has an exotic crystal structure containing 58 atoms in a cubic unit cell .",
    "this @xmath13mn exhibits a complex antiferromagnetic order below the nel temperature of 95 k and is nonmagnetic at room temperature.@xcite the magnetic transition of @xmath14-mn is coupled to a tetragonal distortion .",
    "recent density functional calculations indicate a noncollinear magnetic ground state for @xmath13mn.@xcite the other polymorph of mn , known as @xmath15mn , also has a stable noncollinear configuration even though the ground state is weakly ferrimagnetic.@xcite these results are in good agreement with the neutron scattering,@xcite magnetic torque@xcite and nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite experiments , where the experimental results are interpreted in terms of noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure .    as mentioned earlier small mn clusters , which have less symmetry constraints , are likely candidates for the occurrence of noncollinear magnetic structure .",
    "however , majority of the theoretical calculations have been made under the collinear spin assumption.@xcite among them , most extensive study has been done by kabir _",
    "et al . _ , where the structural and magnetic properties of mn@xmath0 clusters in the size range @xmath12@xmath220 have been investigated using density functional theory.@xcite it was found that mn@xmath16 , mn@xmath17 and mn@xmath18 exhibit ferromagnetic ordering , whereas a magnetic transition to the ferrimagnetic ordering takes place at @xmath1 5 and the ferrimagnetic state continues to be the ground state for clusters with @xmath19 5 .",
    "the predicted magnetic moments are in well agreement with the stern - gerlach ( sg ) clusters beam experiments.@xcite however very recently,@xcite we pointed out that the noncollinear treatment of spins is indeed necessary at the size range @xmath46 .",
    "_ studied mn@xmath20 and mn@xmath21 clusters and found mn@xmath21 to be the smallest cluster to exhibit noncollinear ground state.@xcite however , using local spin density approximation longo _",
    "_ found that all the clusters in the size range @xmath1 3@xmath27 have noncollinear ground states.@xcite recently , noncollinear magnetic ordering has also been found in small mn - clusters supported on a cu(111 ) surface.@xcite in this study however , the cluster geometries have been assumed planer and they were placed on a regular face centered - cubic cu lattice with experimental lattice parameters .",
    "no structural relaxation for either the surface or the cluster was considered .",
    "the present paper is the sequel of our earlier reports.@xcite . in this paper , we allow noncollinear ordering of atomic moments and extensively study how collinear and noncollinear magnetic ordering evolves in small mn@xmath0 clusters and how the magnetic ordering gets perturbed if we dope a single nonmagnetic atom ( for example an as - atom ) into it .",
    "this is important as ( iii , mn)v semiconductors show ferromagnetism and the effect of mn - clustering is being debated for a long time.@xcite moreover , the noncollinear ferromagnetism is common in ( iii , mn)v semiconductors.@xcite experimental study by potashnik _",
    "et al._@xcite indicated that the curie temperature , the ground state saturation magnetization @xmath22 and the shape of the @xmath23 curve all depend upon the temperature and annealing .",
    "these can be explained only if the noncollinearity in the localized mn magnetic moments is considered in the ground state.@xcite from this point of view , it will be very interesting to investigate whether small as@mn@xmath0 clusters do show noncollinearity or not .",
    "in the theoretical approaches to noncollinear magnetism,@xcite the wave functions are described by two - component spinors , @xmath24 , where @xmath14 and @xmath25 are the spin indices .",
    "the density matrix is defined as , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the occupation number of the single - particle state .",
    "+ the charge @xmath28 and magnetization @xmath29 parts of the density matrix can be extracted by expanding in terms of the pauli spin matrices @xmath30 @xmath31 , @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the cartesian components of @xmath29 .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential , @xmath34 , contains nonmagnetic and magnetic parts .",
    "the nonmagnetic part @xmath35 and @xmath36 are given as a function of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the same way that is done in the case of collinear magnetism , but here in addition @xmath39 is always parallel to @xmath29 . in this scheme , the individual eigenstates can have different spin quantization directions and furthermore , the spin quantization axis of the each state can vary with position .",
    "calculations have been performed using density functional theory ( dft ) within the pseudopotential plane wave method .",
    "the projector augmented wave method@xcite has been used and for the spin - polarized gradient approximation to the exchange - correlation energy we used the perdew - burke - ernzerhof functional,@xcite as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _",
    "simulation package.@xcite the 3@xmath40 , 4@xmath41 for mn and 4@xmath41 , 4@xmath42 orbitals for as are treated as valence states .",
    "the spinor wave functions are expanded in a plane wave basis set with the kinetic energy cutoff 337.3 ev .",
    "we have ensured that the cutoff is sufficient by varying it up to 600 ev and found that the energy difference between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states converges within @xmath43 1 mev for mn@xmath16 and as@mn@xmath16 .",
    "calculations have been carried out at the @xmath44-point .",
    "we adopted periodic boundary conditions and described the cluster within a large simple cubic supercell such that the periodic images are separated by at least 12 of vacuum .",
    "this essentially ensures negligible interactions between the periodic images .",
    "symmetry unrestricted optimizations were performed using quasi - newtonian and conjugate gradient methods until all the force components become less than 0.005 ev/. for a particular sized mn@xmath0 and as@mn@xmath0 cluster , several different initial structures were studied to ensure that the globally optimized geometry does not correspond to a local minima , and to be extensive , both noncollinear and collinear magnetic structures have been considered separately . moreover , we explicitly considered all possible spin multiplicities for the collinear case .    for a collinear spin cluster",
    "all the spins are parallel ( @xmath45 ) or antiparallel ( @xmath46 ) to each other . on the other hand , the angle between any two moments could be anything in between @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a noncollinear case and the deviation from @xmath45 or @xmath46 is termed  degree of noncollinearity \" .",
    "the average degree of noncollinearity for a particular cluster can be defined as , @xmath47 where @xmath48 runs for all independent spin pairs and @xmath49 is the total number of such independent spin(atom ) pairs with @xmath50 being the number of atoms in the cluster .",
    "@xmath51 is either @xmath45 or @xmath46 and @xmath52 is the angle between @xmath53-th and @xmath54-th moment .",
    "in an earlier work , we have studied the magnetic ordering of pure mn@xmath0 ( @xmath55 ) clusters within the collinear atomic moment assumption.@xcite above a certain cluster size ( @xmath37=5 ) , the magnetic ordering is found to be ferrimagnetic and the calculated magnetic moments were in good agreement@xcite with stern - gerlach experiments.@xcite however , the validity of the collinear spin assumption should be checked rigorously because , in principle , the complex ferrimagnetic ordering and magnetic ` frustration ' @xcite could definitely lead to the noncollinear ordering in magnetic clusters .",
    "the type of magnetic ordering along with the total magnetic moment and relative energy difference with the ground state are given in the table [ tab : table1 ] and the optimal noncollinear structures are shown in fig.[fig : composite ] ( @xmath13@xmath210 ) and fig.[fig : mn13 ] ( @xmath1 13 , 15 and 19 ) for pure mn@xmath0 clusters .",

    "binding energies of the optimal collinear and noncollinear magnetic structures have been shown in fig.[fig : be ] for both pure mn@xmath0 and as@mn@xmath0 clusters .",
    "it has been understood@xcite that due to the lack of hybridization between the filled 4@xmath41 states and the half - filled 3@xmath40 states and due to high ( 2.14 ev ) 4@xmath6 3@xmath7 @xmath10 4@xmath11 3@xmath12 promotion energy , mn atoms do not bind strongly when they form clusters or crystals .",
    "this is manifested through their low binding energy ( see fig.[fig : be ] ) , which is the lowest among all other 3@xmath40- transition metal clusters .",
    "this is also experimentally evidenced through recent photodissociation experiments for cationic clusters.@xcite however , the bonding improves considerably due to doping of single nonmagnetic as - atom.@xcite when an as - atom is attached to the pure mn@xmath0 clusters , due to enhanced hybridization through the as-@xmath42 electrons , the binding energy of the resultant as@mn@xmath0 cluster increases substantially .",
    "it is found that the energy gain in adding an as - atom to an existing pure mn@xmath0 cluster is much larger than that of adding a mn - atom to an existing as@mn@xmath65 cluster.@xcite this clearly indicates that the as - atom may act as a nucleation center for mn - atoms .",

    "this establishes the importance to treat the moments noncollinearly .",
    "the total magnetic moment of pure mn@xmath0 and as@mn@xmath0 clusters of the corresponding ground states and closely lying isomers are given in table [ tab : table1 ] and table [ tab : table2 ] , respectively , and plotted in fig.[fig : mag ] for the ground states .",
    "pure mn@xmath0 clusters in the size range @xmath3 4 have collinear ground state and the mn - mn coupling is ferromagnetic .",
    "these clusters have a 5 @xmath8/atom magnetic moment which is the hund s rule value for isolated mn - atom .",
    "the magnetic moment per atom decreases drastically at @xmath1 5 and the magnetic ground states start to be noncollinear for @xmath4 6 .",
    "however , we have found many collinear and noncollinear isomers with varying magnetic moment which are close in energy ( not shown in fig.[fig : mag ] , see for instance table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the ground state magnetic moments of pure mn@xmath0 clusters are compared with the sg experiment in fig.[fig : mag ] .",
    "calculated magnetic moments are in good agreement with the sg experiment .",
    "however , the quantitative value differ for few clusters sizes . for an example",
    ", we find a much larger magnetic moment ( 2.14 @xmath8/atom ) for mn@xmath21 cluster compared to the experimental value of 0.55 @xmath8/atom.@xcite however , our predicted value agrees with previous dft calculation.@xcite this quantitative discrepancy between the calculated and measured magnetic moment may arise from few reasons : ( i ) if the true ground state is missed out during the search through the potential energy surface , which is very much unlikely in the present case as we have extensively considered many different geometric and magnetic structures as initial guess .",
    "( ii ) in every magnetic deflection measurement the magnetic moments are calculated assuming a model ( e.g. superparamagnetic , locked moment , adiabatic magnetization etc . ) which might affect the outcome . ( iii ) due to the isomer distribution in the experimental cluster beam .",
    "the large moment of pure mn@xmath0 and as@mn@xmath0 clusters arise from localized 3@xmath40 electrons at mn - atoms .",
    "however , the strong @xmath5 hybridization induces a small negative polarization to the as - atom .",
    "for example , this negative polarization is 0.26 @xmath8 for asmn dimer .",
    "however , the magnitude of this negative polarization decreases monotonically to 0.01 @xmath8 for as@mn@xmath64 cluster . generally , the total magnetic moment of as@mn@xmath0 cluster is lower than the corresponding pure mn@xmath0 cluster due to @xmath5 hybridization .",
    "similar to their pure counterparts , the mn - mn coupling in as@mn@xmath16 and as@mn@xmath18 is collinear ferromagnetic and the emergence of noncollinear ground state is seen at @xmath37=6 .",
    "moreover , it has been seen that mn - mn exchange coupling in as@mn@xmath0 clusters show anomalous behavior compared to ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) type predictions.@xcite for collinear ground state of as@mn@xmath16 cluster exchange coupling oscillates between positive and negative with mn - mn separation ( @xmath68 ) favoring the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic solutions , respectively , and dies down as 1/@xmath69 , which is a typical rkky - type behavior .",
    "however on the other hand , the average exchange coupling decreases with @xmath37 and has strong environment dependency , which is in contradiction with the rkky - type prediction .",
    "this study presents a systematic investigation of electronic structure and emergence of noncollinear magnetism in pure mn@xmath0 and as@mn@xmath0 clusters within gradient - corrected dft approach .",
    "no considerable structural change has been found due to noncollinear treatment of atomic moments for both pure and doped manganese clusters",
    ". moreover , single as - doping to mn@xmath0 clusters does not give rise any considerable structural change , but only a moderate perturbation to their pure counterpart .",
    "the pure mn@xmath0 clusters have low binding energies , which improves substantially due to single as - doping through strong @xmath5 hybridization .",
    "the ground state of both pure mn@xmath0 and as@mn@xmath0 clusters for @xmath3 5 is collinear and emergence of noncollinear ground states is seen for @xmath4 6 .",
    "however , for both kind of clusters , there exist many collinear and noncollinear isomers . due to strong @xmath5 hybridization",
    "the magnetic moments of as@mn@xmath0 are smaller compared to their pure counterpart .",
    "this also induces a negative polarization to the as - atom in as@mn@xmath0 cluster .",
    "although the results presented here are specific to the mn@xmath0 and as@mn@xmath0 clusters , they also contain more general picture : noncollinear magnetic ordering is possible in small magnetic clusters .",
