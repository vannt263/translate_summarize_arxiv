    "the metallic a - f giants , found by hauck ( 1986 ) on the basis of their high @xmath0 index , have an abundance pattern similar to that of am stars , except for ca and sc which have a more or less solar abundance ( berthet 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "their chemical anomalies closely resemble those of the @xmath2 stars , which seem to be evolved am stars ( kurtz 1976 ) .",
    "therefore , it appeared natural to consider the metallic a - f giants as evolved am stars too .",
    "indeed , the theory of radiative diffusion foresees that calcium , which had sinked to large atmospheric depths in the beginning of the star s life would be finally dredged up by the increasingly deeper outer convective zone as the star would reach the giant phase .",
    "this scenario was advocated by berthet ( 1992 ) .",
    "hereafter , we reconsider this question from a different standpoint and examine the evolutionary state of the metallic a - f giants in the light of the hipparcos results .",
    "if metallic a - f giants were indeed evolved am stars , they should share with them two essential characteristics : slow rotation and high rate of binaries .",
    "since giants have a larger radius , they should rotate even more slowly than am stars , merely by conservation of angular momentum",
    ". however , a glance at the distributions of the @xmath1 values of am , metallic and non - metallic a - f giants suffices to cast serious doubts on the idea of an evolutionary link between am and metallic giants ( see figure 11 of knzli & north 1997 ) : @xmath1 is uniformly distributed between 0 and 150  kms@xmath3 for metallic giants , while it shows a maximum at 30 - 40  kms@xmath3 and remains smaller than 100 kms@xmath3 for am stars .",
    "the rate of binaries has been examined using both data from the literature and observations done at observatoire de haute - provence ( cnrs ) , france , with the aurlie spectrograph attached to the 1.52 m telescope in 1994 . for metallic a - f giants ,",
    "the rate of binaries with orbital periods shorter than 1000 days is no more than about 23% , matching very well the figure ( 21.7% ) found by duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) for g dwarfs .",
    "this figure is to be compared with the result of abt & levy ( 1985 ) , who found 75% of binaries among am stars . here",
    "again , the metallic giants lack an essential characteristic of am stars , namely a high rate of binaries ( knzli & north 1997 ) .    if metallic a - f giants are not evolved am stars , what are they ?",
    "the simplest alternative scenario is that every a star goes through a short `` metallic '' phase at the end of its life on ( or just beyond ) the main sequence .",
    "practically all stars considered by hauck ( 1986 ) have been measured by hipparcos , and many of them are closer than 100 pc or have , in any case , a relative precision on the parallax better than @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting hr diagram shows that the metallic giants tend to be more evolved on average than their normal counterparts , as confirmed by the cumulative distributions of the @xmath5 values .",
    "the @xmath5 values were obtained from the luminosities deduced from the hipparcos parallaxes , from the @xmath6 deduced from geneva photometry calibrated by knzli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and from masses interpolated in the evolutionary tracks of schaller et al .",
    "the ks test shows a very significant difference between the distributions of @xmath5 for metallic and normal giants .",
    "the mass distribution of the metallic giants is strongly peaked at 2 m@xmath7 , while the mass distribution of am stars is peaked at 1.5 m@xmath7 ( north 1993 ) .",
    "this difference alone does not completely exclude , however , any possible link between am stars and metallic giants , because low mass am stars would have evolved into giants with a @xmath6 cooler than the limit above which radiative diffusion still works .",
    "there is a set of rather compelling arguments against the idea that metallic a - f giants would be evolved am stars . on the other hand , the precise hipparcos parallaxes allow for the first time to pinpoint these metallic giants in the hr diagram and to show that they all have @xmath8 .",
    "this seems to add some weight to the alternative idea that these giants have nothing to do with am stars but may be former `` normal '' a stars going through a short phase where , for some as yet unclear reason , radiative diffusion is allowed to enhance the metallic abundance in their atmosphere ."
