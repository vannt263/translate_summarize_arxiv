    "the formation of massive stars presents many challenges due to the competing and interlinked roles of gravity , magnetic fields and radiation .",
    "it is becoming clear through numerical simulations that material can continue to accrete on to a luminous , massive forming star via an accretion disc despite the strong radiation pressure on dust ( krumholz et al .",
    "2009 ; kuiper et al . 2010 ) .",
    "bipolar outflows appear to be a ubiquitous ingredient in the star formation process driven by magnetic forces ( banerjee & pudritz 2007 ) which also helps relieve the extreme radiation pressure ( cunningham et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "these competing infall and outflow processes shape the circumstellar matter distribution around massive forming stars .",
    "the corollary of this is that a detailed mapping of the circumstellar matter distribution can be used to constrain models of massive star formation .",
    "one way to probe the circumstellar matter close to the protostar is to use the emission from the heated dust .",
    "this has some advantages over using molecular line emission for which complex chemical and excitation effects have to be taken into account before the total gas density distribution can be recovered .",
    "there are also disadvantages with using warm dust emission as it does not convey any kinematic information and becomes optically thick for @xmath3 .",
    "however , a full understanding of the dust emission also yields the temperature distribution of the material which is an important input back into the molecular line diagnostic process .",
    "different ir wavelengths will probe regions at different distances from the central accreting source due to the temperature gradients .",
    "typical temperature gradients vary from @xmath4 in the optically thick part to @xmath5 in optically thin regions ( eg .",
    "ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) . taking the over - simplified approach of the wien displacement law to locate where most of the emission arises from",
    ", we then see that the size of the emitting region @xmath6 or @xmath7 in optically thick and thin regions respectively . in the immediate environment of a protostar",
    "we will have optically thick conditions in the dense mid - plane regions whilst the bipolar outflow cavities will be mostly optically thin .",
    "high resolution studies of the warm dust emission around massive forming stars have included the 8 - 13  interferometric studies by de wit et al .",
    "( 2007;2010;2011 ) .",
    "these 40 milliarcsecond resolution studies probe size scales of about 100 au for typical distances of nearby massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) which approaches the size of the dust sublimation radius of about 25 au .",
    "the mid - ir visibilities are mostly matched by 2d axisymmetric radiative transfer models where most of the emission arises from the warm dust along cavity walls .",
    "a compact element inside the dust sublimation radius such as an accretion disc may be needed to explain the rising 8  visibilities .",
    "since the dusty bipolar cavity walls are directly illuminated by the central star then this is mostly optically thin emission .",
    "we would therefore expect the size of the emitting region to scale as @xmath8 .",
    "for single - dish observations then this size scale is getting larger faster than the diffraction - limited resolution is degrading .",
    "hence , for a given diameter telescope it is better to use the longest wavelength possible . for the thermal - ir regime from the ground",
    "this is 24.5  at the far end of the q band . scaling from the 60 milliarcsecond size for w33a at 13  ( de wit et al .",
    "2007 ) this would yield a size of 0.2  at 24.5  which would be partially resolved by the 0.6  diffraction limit for 8 m telescopes .",
    "this is what was found by de wit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and wheelwright et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who partially resolved a sample of massive ysos .",
    "de wit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) modelled the extended emission with spherical models and concluded that the density distribution needed to be @xmath9 .",
    "this was interpreted as requiring some rotational support on these scales as it is shallower than the @xmath10 expected for free - falling material .",
    "wheelwright et al .",
    "( 2012 ) again used 2d axisymmetric radiative transfer models to show that the 20  emission is also dominated by the warm envelope dust along the cavity walls .",
    "this is seen explicitly in some edge - on systems ( e.g. de buizer 2005 ; 2006 ) .",
    "the recent release of herschel space telescope data provides the highest resolution images to date at far - ir wavelengths .",
    "if we extend the scaling above to the shortest wavelength of herschel of 70  then we would expect a size of the emitting region of about 2 .",
    "this is comparable to the 5  diffraction - limited beam of herschel at 70 .",
    "hence , we expect to recover further spatial information on the somewhat cooler dust located further from the central object , but not so far as to be more influenced by the general molecular core environment and ambient radiation field as is likely at the longer herschel wavebands .",
    "the most extensive observations of massive forming stars with herschel comes from the hi - gal survey of the galactic plane ( molinari et al .",
    "2010a ) where most massive young stars are located .",
    "here we examine these data from the first two science demonstration phase fields observed as part of hi - gal ( molinari et al .",
    "2010a ) to determine whether massive ysos are indeed extended at 70 .",
    "we define massive ysos as deeply embedded , luminous ( l3000 ) , mid - ir - bright , point sources that are not ionizing their surroundings to form an ultra - compact h ii region ( uchii ) .",
    "the lifetime of this phase is about 10@xmath11 years ( davies et al . 2011 ; mottram et al .",
    "davies et al .",
    "( 2011 ) show that the luminosity function of mysos and uchii regions is consistent with the mysos becoming swollen due to high accretion rates as predicted by the models of hosokawa & omukai ( 2009 ) .",
    "this means their effective temperatures are too low to ionise their surroundings until either they stop accreting at high rates or grow to greater than about 30 , when they contract rapidly down to their main sequence radius .",
    "the sample of mysos we use comes from the red msx survey ( rms ) ( lumsden et al .",
    "starting from an initial colour selection of mid - ir bright sources ( lumsden et al .",
    "2002 ) from the msx satellite point source catalogue ( price et al .",
    "2001 ) we have followed these up with radio continuum observations to distinguish uchii regions and dusty planetary nebulae ( urquhart et al .",
    "2009 ) ; determined kinematic distances from @xmath12co observations and h i absorption ( urquhart et al . 2008 ; 2012 ) ; and determined luminosities from far - ir fluxes ( mottram et al . 2010 ; 2011b ) .",
    "all mysos discussed in this paper are undetected at 5 ghz at the 1 mjy level .    in this paper",
    "we examine the herschel imaging of the rms mysos in two lots of 2 square degree regions of the galactic plane .",
    "the peculiarities of the hi - gal 70  point spread function ( psf ) are discussed in section  [ psf ] and the 70  imaging of the rms mysos in these regions is described in section  [ observations ] .",
    "radiative transfer modelling of the 70  emission is presented in section  [ modelling ] and the results discussed in section  [ results ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the hi - gal survey was carried out in a specially developed parallel mode whereby the pacs and spire instruments simultaneously scan the sky at a fast rate of 60  per second ( molinari et al . 2010 ) .",
    "this causes the nominally circular pacs 70  beam with fwhm of 5.3  to be smeared out in the scan direction with a resultant size of 5.8  @xmath13 12.1  ( lutz 2012 ) .",
    "a high signal - to - noise representation of the pacs parallel mode 70  psf is shown in figure  [ fig : vesta ] , which shows an image of the asteroid vesta observed in similar conditions as hi - gal data ( see lutz 2012 ) .",
    "the first airy ring can also be seen smeared out along the scan direction ( pa=42.5 ) and a dark spot is seen at one end of the scan direction .",

    "a constant value of 10 was added to the normalised fluxes .",
    ", width=321 ]    the two science demonstration phase ( hereafter sdp ) hi - gal fields were visually inspected to search for objects that might be suitable psf objects at 70 , i.e. bright , unresolved and isolated .",
    "such objects are rare and we only found two in each of the sdp fields and their details are listed in table  [ tab : psfstars ] .",
    "these appear to be all agb or post - agb stars and they were all located away from the mid - plane consistent with an evolved , intermediate mass population .",
    "such stars are losing mass with dusty winds which makes them suitable for ir psf stars .",
    "however , as de wit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found these stars can also be extended and so have to be treated with caution when using as psf objects .",
    ".parameters of the psf objects found within the two hi - gal sdp fields at 70 . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath14 note this object is in a cluster with several other ysos within about 5 .",
    "its glimpse 8  flux is only 20% of the larger msx beam 8  flux and its total luminosity has therefore been reduced by this amount to reflect the fact there may be other luminosity sources in the large beam far - ir measurements of bolometric luminosity ( see mottram et al .",
    "+ @xmath15 the physical size of a spherical dusty cloud heated to a particular temperature by a central source depends on the square root of the heating source luminosity which determines the spatial scales of the solution to the radiative transfer equation ( iveci & elitzur 1997 ) .",
    "the angular size is then inversely proportional to the distance .",
    "therefore , it is an indicator of how resolved is a source ( see section [ results ] ) .            comparing g030.8185 + 00.2729 in figure [ fig : ysobin ] to the naive map of the psf star v1362 aql in figure  [ fig : psfbin ] ,",
    "clearly shows that the former is more extended compared to the psf star .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : yso2_images ] shows the nominal and orthogonal scan images for g030.8185 + 00.2729 and these clearly show extended emission along the minor axis direction compared to the psf star in figure  [ fig : psf1scans ] .",
    "intensity profiles for slices along the minor axis were constructed for each of the mysos as described above for the psf objects . in figures  [ fig : g030.8185_scan ] to [ fig : g059.8329_scan ] these slices ( square blue points with error bars ) are compared with those for vesta ( dashed cyan line ) . again",
    "the 70  emission from the myso is clearly more extended in the minor axis direction than the herschel psf for all the mysos in both scan directions .",
    "although herschel images of the same fields at 160 , 250 , 350 and 500  are available , we limited the use of these images only for the sed .",
    "however , ground - based sub - mm observations are available which are at higher resolution .",
    "azimuthally averaged radial profiles at 870  were obtained from atlasgal images ( contreras et al .",
    "2013 ) and at 450  from the scuba legacy catalogues ( di francesco et al . 2008 ) and are shown in figure [ fig : longerwlg ] .",
    "annulii of 1.5 times the pixel size ( 6  at 870  and 3  at 450 ) were chosen to compute the average flux in each bin of angular distance from the peak .",
    "the errors in each bin were estimated by the standard deviation of the fluxes in each annulus .",
    "to interpret the extended emission that we see at 70  we have adapted the modelling procedure used by de wit et al .",
    "we used the same grid of spherical radiative transfer models for mysos that was calculated by de wit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using the dusty code ( ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) .",
    "the grid of 120 000 models spans a range in density law exponent @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath16 varying from 0 to 2 in steps of 0.5 , a@xmath18 from 5 to 200 in steps of 5 , and the ratio of outer radius to sublimation radius , @xmath19 , varying from 10 to 5000 . for this study",
    "other model grid parameters were kept constant .",
    "these include the stellar effective temperature that was kept at 25 000 k corresponding to a b0 v star as the ir emission is insensitive to this parameter . for the dust model we used the ism model as described in de wit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that consists of draine & lee ( 1984 ) graphite and silicate with an mrn size distribution ( mathis et al .",
    "this has a sub - mm emissivity law with a slope of @xmath20 .",
    "the dust sublimation temperature was kept constant at 1500 k.    each model was scaled to the appropriate luminosity and distance for the mysos in table  [ tab : rmsmysos ] .",
    "a circular image of the emergent 70  emission from the spherical model was generated and then convolved with the vesta psf rebinned for the hi - gal pixel scale .",
    "as before , an intensity profile slice was generated from an average of the three rows across the minor axis of the psf direction normalised to the peak pixel .",
    "these model slices were then compared to the observed ones , both in the nominal and orthogonal scan directions .",
    "simultaneously with fitting the intensity profile slice we also fitted the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the luminosity used to scale the models comes from fitting the sed .",
    "the data points in the seds in figures  [ fig : g030.8185_scan ] to [ fig : g059.8329_scan ] are from 2mass ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) , glimpse ( churchwell et al .",
    "2009 ) , msx ( price et al .",
    "2001 ) , herschel ( this work ) , sub - millimetre ( di francesco et al . 2008 ; contreras et al .",
    "2013 ) and millimetre observations ( beuther et al . 2002 ; beltrn et al . 2006 ) .",
    "errors of 10% were adopted for all the sed data points to account for uncertainties in the absolute calibration across different datasets . during the fitting procedure reduced-@xmath21 ( hereafter @xmath21 )",
    "values were calculated for both the fits to the intensity slice and sed , where the degrees of freedom were the number of fitted points minus one .",
    "these are each placed in order of increasing @xmath21 and the model that is top of the combined order is considered to be the best fitting model ( e.g. de wit 2009 ) .",
    "the best combined fits to the 70  intensity profile and sed for each direction are shown in figures [ fig : g030.8185_scan ] to [ fig : g059.8329_scan ] whilst the parameters are listed in table [ tab : results ] . in what follows , the results are not referred to any particular scan direction unless otherwise stated .",
    "reasonable combined fits to the intensity profile of most of the objects are obtained with the models , with @xmath21 near 1 for the 70  profile .",
    "the sed fit shows that fluxes at @xmath22  are always underestimated .",
    "this is common for spherical models as they do not account for near - ir light being scattered and escaping from the bipolar outflow cavities ( de wit et al .",
    "the average power law index of the best fitting models is @xmath23 .",
    "figure [ fig : longerwlg ] show the profiles at 450 and 870  as seen in the combined fit of the sed and 70  intensity profile .",
    "sub - mm radial profiles were also used instead of the 70  slices to analyse the effects of the spatial information from different wavelengths on the density distribution fit .",
    "these profiles constrain the density distribution of the cool outer regions . the combined 850/450  profile and sed best fits have an average exponent @xmath23 , which is consistent with the combined 70  profile and sed fit .",
    "finally , fits to each individual observation were also calculated .",
    "the results show that the best fits to radial profiles have exponents between 1 and 2 , whilst the fits to seds have exponents between 0 and 0.5 .",
    "in addition , the exponent of the best fitted models to the radial profiles is independent of a@xmath18  and the size of the cloud .",
    "the average power law index is shallower than the @xmath24 exponent in the sample of de wit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) who fitted 24.5  intensity profiles and sed .",
    "in addition , our averages do not agree in general with other works which have found that the values of the power law index vary between @xmath25 and @xmath26 by combining sed and sub - mm observations ( e.g. mueller et al .",
    "nevertheless , in the particular case of g030.8185 + 00.2729 , williams et al .",
    "( 2005 ) obtained an exponent of @xmath27 by using the sed and 850  radial profile , which agrees with our results .",

    "( 2005 ) where obtained by including in the sed points with @xmath28  whilst mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) included points with @xmath29 .",
    "we experimented with also only fitting data with @xmath29and found that in general values of exponents are 0.5 lower than using the whole sed , and therefore the exponents are still between 0 and 1 .",
    "we obviously do not expect to match the average results of mueller et al . and de wit et al . since our sample has only 3 objects .",
    "the power law indexes for the slice only and 870  only cases vary between @xmath30 and @xmath26 , whilst in the 450  only cases its value is @xmath31 .",
    "these values are consistent with those obtained by beuther et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who found an average value of @xmath32 , even though they derived their values from a power law fitted to the radial profiles instead of doing the radiative transfer .",
    "of course , these models do not fit the sed well .    on the other hand , the power law indexes for the fits to the sed only vary between @xmath33 and @xmath27 .",
    "this is similar to previous studies that use a dust emissivity law with a slope of @xmath34 ( e.g. chini et al .",
    "1986 ) . as discussed by hoare et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , a shallower dust emissivity law allows fits with a steeper density distribution .",
    "in fact , inspection of the sed fits at @xmath35  in figure [ fig : g058.7087_scan ] appears to show that the @xmath36 emissivity law used in the modelling is slightly too steep .",
    "moreover , a study of the dust emissivity law in these two regions by paradis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) shows that the emissivity slope should be @xmath37 in @xmath0  and @xmath38 in @xmath1   for a dust temperature of 30 k. our higher value of the slope would also explain the large values of a@xmath18 , for steeper emissivity laws need more dust mass to match the dust emission in the far - ir / submm .",
    "the values of a@xmath18  range between 95 and 200 for the combined sed and slice fit , but most of the sources have an a@xmath18  of 200 .",
    "this is consistent with them being massive , young and embedded objects in their parental clouds .",
    "however , de wit et al .",
    "( 2009 ) found lower values than ours . in the particular case of g030.8185",
    "+ 00.2729 , williams et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a value @xmath39 times larger than ours , and using the method of mueller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) we obtain similar values of a@xmath18  as those obtained by considering all the points in the sed .",
    "either way , all these results point towards values of a@xmath18  greater than 90 magnitudes , and the inclusion of points at smaller wavelengths does not determine the value of a@xmath18  though it helps to constrain it .",
