    "whether stars form in the similar way everywhere in different physical / chemical environments or not is of great interest .",
    "many groups are studying the initial mass function ( imf ) in various environments , including the lmc and smc , to find little difference ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which appears to suggest the universality of star formation . in the galaxy ,",
    "environments largely differ depending on the galactic radius , e.g. , metallicity , gas density , perturbation by spiral arms , which may offer an opportunity to study the environmental dependence of star formation @xcite .    previously , we studied young clusters in the extreme outer galaxy with @xmath8kpc and suggested that the imfs and star formation efficiency ( sfe ) are not largely different from the solar neighborhood except for the lifetime of protoplanetary disks , which was found to be significantly shorter than in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this might suggest that the environment affects disk evolution and thus planet formation more than star formation .",
    "star formation could also be largely affected by intra - cluster effects e.g. , stellar winds , radiation , and dynamical effects @xcite .",
    "because such effects largely depend on the existence of massive stars , the resultant star formation may also differ with the cluster mass ( @xmath9 ) @xcite .",
    "for very massive clusters ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath3 ) , the imf may be different than the standard imf @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the disk lifetime on the cluster mass and density is also suggested    .    as the next step for our study of the disk fraction in stellar clusters as a function of galactocentric radius ,",
    "we study the quartet cluster that is a young cluster discovered by @xcite from spitzer / glimpse images in the galactic plane at @xmath10 .",
    "the cluster is named after a tight grouping of four mid - infrared brightest stars in the cluster ( m1 , m2 , m3 , and m5 in fig .  1 ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "we selected the quartet cluster with the following two criteria .",
    "( 1 ) it has an @xmath11 that is about half that of the sun , and so a notable environmental difference compared to the solar neighborhood is expected .",
    "( 2 ) it is important to study clusters with more common mass ( @xmath12@xmath2@xmath3 ) for direct comparison with solar neighborhood ( @xmath13kpc ) , where most young clusters have the cluster mass of less than @xmath5@xmath3 @xcite",
    ". however previous studies of clusters in the inner galaxy had focused on very massive clusters with @xmath14@xmath3 , because it was very difficult to find smaller clusters in such distant regions due to limited sensitivity .",
    "recently , however , the spitzer glimpse survey by e.g. , @xcite and @xcite led to the discovery of several star clusters of @xmath15@xmath3 such as the quartet cluster .    in this paper , we investigated the evolution of protoplanetary disks in the quartet cluster . in section  [ sec : quartet ]",
    ", we describe the quartet cluster , in particular , on the age of the cluster , since it is critical for interpreting the disk fraction . in section  [ sec : imging ] , we present photometry using moderately deep jhk images obtained from the ukidss survey imaging ( @xmath16mag ) .",
    "we then discuss intermediate - mass ( i m ) stars with k - band disk excesses ( haebe stars ) discovered in the quartet cluster in section  [ sec : results_img ] . for three of the selected haebe candidates we obtained ircs spectroscopy in section  [ sec : spec ] .",
    "we then discuss the properties of objects with ircs spectra in section  [ sec : results_spec ] .",
    "finally , we estimated intermediate - mass disk fraction ( imdf ) for the quartet cluster to discuss the nature of disks in the innermost galactic disk in section  [ sec : imdf_qua ] .",
    "@xcite presented near - infrared ( hk - bands ) spectroscopic observations of bright ( @xmath17mag ) massive stars ( ofpe , wn9 , and ob stars ) , which are selected based on 2mass data .",
    "the distance is estimated to be 6.3kpc from ob stars in the cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the kinematic distance derived with radio recombination line observations to an region g024.83@xmath1800.10 ( 6kpc ; @xcite ) , with which the quartet cluster is associated .",
    "the age of the cluster is estimated to be 38myr : older than 3myr from the existence of evolved stars , such as wr and ofpe / wn9 , and younger than 8myr from the existence of wr stars and the absence of red supergiants ( rsgs ) .",
    "they also estimated the cluster mass to be a few @xmath2@xmath3 from a simple simulation with stellar populations .",
    "in addition , because both wn and wc stars exist ( two wn and one wc ) , the age range should be narrowed to @xmath136myr ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , from the existence of at least three ob stars whose masses are @xmath1940@xmath3 ( fig .  4 in @xcite ) , the age of the quartet is likely to be less than 4.5myr because such stars evolve off the main sequence ( ms ) in that time @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the age of the quartet is most likely @xmath134.5myr .",
    "we used data from the united kingdom infrared telescope infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; @xcite ) galactic plane survey ( gps ; @xcite ) archive , which includes j , h , k , and h@xmath20-band images .",
    "the ukidss images are obtained using the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) , and the wfcam wide - field camera @xcite .",
    "wfcam pixel scale is 0.4arcsec and the images have a fwhm@xmath11arcsec .",
    "we obtained j , h , and k band images around the quartet cluster from the gps data release 4 .",
    "the mko near - infrared photometric filters ( @xcite ; tokunaga , simons , & vacca 2002 ) are employed .    because the target region is near the galactic plane and is confusion limited , the wsa ( wfcam science archive ) catalogue based on ukidss is found to be incomplete , in particular for fainter stars .",
    "we therefore performed photometry with psf fitting using iraf / daophot . for deriving psf , we picked up unsaturated bright stars , which are well off the edge of the frame and do not have any nearby stars with magnitue difference of more than 4mag .",
    "psf photometry was performed using the allstar routine two times , once using original images and once using the subtracted images .",
    "we used psf fit radii of 3.8 , 3.3 , and 3.2 pixels for j- , h- , and k - band , respectively , which are the fwhm values , and set the sky annulus four times as large as the psf fit radii .",
    "saturated stars are removed considering the flag information in the wsa catalog . for the photometric calibration",
    ", we used about 100 isolated stars in the frames , whose magnitudes were obtained from the 2mass point source catalog , and converted to mko magnitudes with the photometric color corrections given by @xcite .",
    "we also confirmed that obtained magnitudes are almost identical ( @xmath210.02mag ) to those in the wsa catalogue for isolated stars . limiting magnitudes ( 10@xmath22 ) of @xmath23mag , @xmath24mag and",
    "@xmath25mag were obtained . using the photometric results here",

    "we used the grism mode in combination with the k filter to cover the wavelength region from 1.93@xmath26 m to 2.48@xmath26 m and pixel scale is 52mas pixel@xmath27 .",
    "we used the ao system with natural guide star mode @xcite using wave front reference stars , which are located within 30@xmath28 from the targets and whose magnitudes are @xmath291415mag ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3col_img ] , aqua plus symbols ) .",
    "we achieved a fwhm of @xmath10.20.3@xmath28 in the k band .",
    "we used a slit with 0.225@xmath28 width , which provided a spectral resolving power of @xmath30 .",
    "the slit position angles for targets were set to avoid contaminations of other stars in the slit .",
    "the telescope was nodded along the slit by about 5arcsec between exposures . in order to avoid saturation , exposure time for each frame is set as 180sec .",
    "about 10 sets of data were obtained for each target , resulting in a total exposure time of @xmath11800sec .",
    "spectra of bright telluric standard stars ( hd 139731 ; f0v ) at similar airmass were obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "we summarize the details of the observation in table  [ tab : quaspec_target ] .",
    "all the data were reduced following standard procedures using the iraf noao.imred.echelle package , including sky subtraction ( subtraction of two frames ) , flat - fielding ( halogen lamp with an integrating sphere ) , and aperture extraction .",
    "argon lamp spectra that were taken at the end of the observing night were used for vacuum wavelength calibration .",
    "each target spectrum was divided by the spectrum of the f0v standard star in order to correct for atmospheric absorption and instrumental response after the br@xmath7 absorption line of the standard spectrum was eliminated with linear interpolation . usually , ao correction is more effective for longer wavelength , while the diffraction - limit fwhm is larger for longer wavelength . in our observation ,",
    "the observed fwhm is found to be almost constant throughout the band maybe because both effects are cancelled out .",
    "the signal to noise ( s / n ) for the continuum level for the three targets , haebe 2 , 3 , and 5 ( see section  [ sec : results_img ] ) , are 42 , 9 , and 46 , respectively ( table  [ tab : quaspec_target ] ) . considering the s / n , lines with equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath310.8is detected with 3@xmath22 for haebe 2 and 5 , while lines with ew of @xmath314  is detected with 3@xmath22 for haebe 3 .",
    "using photometric results in section  [ sec : imging ] , we selected haebe candidates in the quartet cluster members with the following steps .      first , we defined the cluster region and the control field using the ukidss k band image of the quartet cluster shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3col_img ] .",
    "we counted the numbers of stars within circles of a 50 pixel ( 10@xmath28 ) radius around the cluster position .",
    "we then defined the center of the circle which includes the maximum numbers of stars as the cluster center , and this was found to be at @xmath32 , @xmath33 , with an uncertainty of @xmath12@xmath28 .",
    "[ fig : pro_qua ] shows the radial variation of the projected stellar density from the cluster center in the k band .",
    "the horizontal solid line shows the background stellar density . there is a dip in the plot at the radius of 20@xmath28 . such a dip in this kind of radial variation plot",
    "is often seen for brighter stars in nearby clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) probably due to the stochastic imf effects on the number of higher mass stars , thus brighter stars @xcite .",
    "however , in our case , this may be also because the bright stars block fainter stars in the images so that the number of stars is not correctly counted .",
    "the very bright stars appear to block fainter stars located within 2.5 fwhm radii ( @xmath12.5arcsec ) from the centers of the bright stars .",
    "the area of a circle with the radius is about 20arcsec@xmath34 . because there are 6 very bright stars ( the four brightest stars , m6 , and m7 in fig .",
    "1 ) around the center of the cluster , the total area of the blocked region is 120arcsec@xmath34 at most . in the dipped bin in the radial plot ( @xmath3520@xmath28 ) the total area is about 950 ( @xmath36 ) arcsec@xmath34 and the blocking can affect about 13% ( @xmath37 ) of the total number _ at most _ and may be partly contributing to the @xmath120% dip in the plot .",
    "we define the cluster region to be within a radius of @xmath38 where the stellar density is larger than that of the background region by 3@xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to 0.9pc assuming a distance to the cluster of 6kpc .",
    "the defined cluster region is smaller than the 45@xmath28 radius found by @xcite , and one of their cluster members , no.9 , is not included in our definition .",
    "however , it is necessary to define the cluster region strictly in order to obtain cluster parameters with higher s / n by subtracting for a control field in the later sections because there should be a lot of contaminations in the field of the quartet .",
    "the region at @xmath39arcmin is regarded as the background region with field stars because the stellar density at @xmath40arcmin appears to fall off sufficiently ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pro_qua ] ) .",

    "[ fig:3col_img ] ( left ) , the defined cluster region is shown with a thick solid circle , while the control field is shown with a thick dashed circle .",
    "we next constructed the @xmath42 versus @xmath43 color - magnitude diagram of all detected point sources in the cluster region ( fig .",

    "stars with the mass of @xmath13@xmath3 are on the turn - on point to the main sequence for the age .",
    "a distance of 6kpc was assumed .",
    "an arrow shows the reddening vector of @xmath44mag . in the color - magnitude diagram",
    "the extinction @xmath45 of each star was estimated from the distance along the reddening vector between its location and the isochrone models by @xcite .",
    "we then constructed the distributions of the extinction of stars in the cluster region ( black ) and those in the control field ( gray ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : av_qua ] .",
    "the resultant distribution for the control field shows three peaks at @xmath46mag , 14mag and @xmath12430mag , while that for the cluster region show a significant excess in the @xmath45 range of 1424mag .",
    "the peak value of the excess extinction for the stars in the cluster region , @xmath47mag , is consistent with @xcite , who estimated extinction of the cluster as @xmath48mag .",
    "therefore , we identified the cluster members as being in the cluster region and with @xmath45 of 1424mag . however , because there could still be a significant amount of background contamination from field stars , we correct for this in discussion in section  [ sec : imdf_qua ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_qua ] , candidate cluster members , stars with @xmath45 of 1424mag , are shown with filled circles , while other stars are shown with gray squares .",

    "the short horizontal lines placed on the thick magenta lines show positions of 45 , 30 , 20 , 10 , 7 , 5 , and 3@xmath3 , that are also shown on the right y - axis .",
    "this indicates that the mass detection limit of possible cluster members with limiting magnitude of @xmath49mag is @xmath15@xmath3 .",
    "therefore , all the possible cluster members should be in the ms phase at the age of 4myr .",
    "just in case , we checked the isochrone tracks in the age range of @xmath134.5myr ( see section  2 ) to see if this conclusion holds .",
    "the isochrone tracks for the ages of 3 and 5myr are shown with dark gray lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_qua ] . because isochrone tracks of the pms phase are located below the distribution of all the candidate cluster members in the color - magnitude diagram",
    ", all the possible cluster members should be in the ms phase regardless of age .",
    "therefore , the estimated extinction values are not affected by the change of isochrone tracks with age .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_qua ] , we also plotted the brightest stars in the cluster in @xcite with large orange triangles , filled ones for possible cluster members and open ones for field stars .",
    "note that two stars in @xcite , no . 4 and 9 , are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_qua ] because they are not located in the cluster region with 30@xmath28 radius , but are at large distances of @xmath11@xmath50 and @xmath12@xmath50 from the cluster center , respectively . only a very bright star , no .",
    "5 , which is identified as a cluster member in @xcite , appears to have a large extinction of @xmath51mag ( see large orange filled triangle in fig .",
    "3 ) , which is out of the extinction range defined above .",
    "because this star is identified as a late - type wc star in @xcite , the large extinction can be attributed to the thick circumstellar shell . in fact , the large color excesses of @xmath521.5mag are observed in case of wc stars in westerlund 1 cluster with the age of @xmath14.55myr @xcite , which is consistent with the differences between colors of the no . 5 star and those of other cluster members identified in @xcite , no . 1 , 2 , 6 , and 7 ( @xmath53mag ;",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_qua ] ) .",
    "therefore , the apparently large color excess of the no . 5 star is likely to be from its intrinsic cause .    in fig .",
    "3 , we also plotted sources in 2mass point source catalog , which are in the cluster region and for which the photometry can not be performed with ukidss data because of saturation , with small orange triangles . only the stars with good photometric quality ( the flag of `",
    "a ' and ` b ' ) are shown .",
    "the results that there are few stars with @xmath54mag ( 2 out of 12 ) also support the idea that the @xmath45 range of 1424mag can pick up almost all of the cluster members .      before identifying haebe candidate stars ( i m stars with k - band disk excess as defined by @xcite ) , we selected i m stars from the candidate cluster members identified in section  [ sec : col - mag ] based on the @xmath55 color - magnitude diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cm_qua ] ) . the j - band magnitudes are less affected by disk excess emission1.5mag , while that of i m stars without disks to be 8.7@xmath561.0mag , suggesting no significant difference of j - band magnitudes .",
    "considering that the differences of distance modulus of stars in a cluster are negligible and that the spectral types of haebes and i m stars without disks are not significantly different , the j - band excess of haebes should be negligible .",
    "] , while large h and k band excesses are seen in haebes ( i m stars with k - band excess ; see fig .",
    "59 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the effects of differential extinction should be very small as discussed in section  4.2 . therefore , we used the j - band magnitudes for selecting i m stars as is usually done for studying distant open clusters .",
    "this approach was successfully applied to the studies of old clusters e.g. , @xmath22 orionis ( @xmath13myr ; @xcite , @xcite ) , upper scorpius ( @xmath15myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of disks around stars earlier than b5 ( @xmath5767@xmath3 in the main - sequence phase ) is not well established since the disk lifetime of high - mass stars is probably very short , e.g. @xmath11myr .",
    "therefore , we set the highest target mass of i m stars as 7@xmath3 that still have protoplanetary disks .",
    "this is the same upper limit mass as @xcite , who systematically derived imdfs for young clusters in the solar neighborhood and estimated disk lifetime of i m stars .    using isochrone models by @xcite with the age of 4myr assuming the distance of 6kpc and the extinction of @xmath58mag , the stellar mass of 7@xmath3 corresponds to @xmath59mag . because stars with mass of more than 5@xmath3 are already in ms phase , the difference of j - band magnitudes of stars with different age between 3 and 4.5myr are very small , only @xmath120.05mag .",

    "non - detections of absorption lines suggest that the spectral types for all three haebe candidates are late o to g , though this is still a rather wide range for spectral type due to the limits of the currently available data . in the age of 34.5myr",

    "although we could not put strong constraints on the upper limit of the stellar mass by spectroscopy ( late o type corresponds to @xmath120@xmath3 ) , the three objects should not be background / foreground massive stars in view of the very small probability of chance projection .",
    "in fact , the j - band magnitude of late o type stars is @xmath5715.5mag at the distance of 6kpc and the extinction of @xmath58mag , which is much brighter than the magnitudes for im - stars ( @xmath77mag for 7@xmath3 ) . because the magnitude for stars with mass of 10@xmath3 comes down to @xmath78mag , which is only @xmath10.5mag brighter than the maximum magnitude of i m stars , the upper limit mass of the three objects are likely to be @xmath110@xmath3 at most , corresponding to early b type .",
    "all three haebe candidates were found to have prominent co bandheads in _",
    "emission_. the k - band excess noted in section  [ sec : cc ] might be due to the co bandhead emission and so we investigated this possibility .",
    "the spectra of haebe 2 , 3 , and 5 were divided by the spectrum of a f0v standard star and multiplied by a blackbody function of 7,300k @xcite to obtain the relative flux density .",
    "we then calculated the ratio of the flux from the co bandhead emission to the continuum flux in the wavelength range of 2.032.37@xmath26 m where atmospheric transmission is @xmath3150% . as a result",
    ", the ratios were found to be 5% , 3% , and 2% in haebe 2 , 3 , and 5 respectively .",
    "if we subtract the excess co bandhead emissions , all of the objects still have sufficient k - band excesses to be identified as haebe candidates on the jhk color - color diagram .",

    ". however , the positions of sgs in the @xmath55 color - magnitude diagram ( section  4.3 ) are very different from those of i m stars ( @xmath81mag ; see fig  3 and fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , because the period of the sgs and ppne phase are very short ( @xmath1@xmath5yr for sgs by @xcite ; @xmath1@xmath2yr for ppne by @xcite ) , it is highly unlikely that such rare objects in the foreground or background are coincidentally superposed on the quartet cluster region . on the other hand ,",
    "the quartet cluster is a young star cluster and the properties of haebe 2 , 3 , and 5 are consistent with ysos from photometry ( section  [ sec : results_img ] ) and spectroscopy ( section  [ sec : results_spec_spt ] ) .",

    "@xcite , whose targets are iras sources identified as luminous ysos , estimated fraction of the detection at 15% for haebe stars . in the case of the quartet cluster , the fraction is at least @xmath140% considering that there are eight haebe candidates and all three objects with spectra has co emission ( 38% ( 3/8 ) ) .",
    "this value appears to be quite high and this may be characteristic of i m stars in the inner galaxy .",
    "however , because the possibility of variability in both co emission and br@xmath7 lines is suggested @xcite , further study is necessary to have a firm conclusion . in any case , the existence of both k - band excess and co bandhead emission in haebe 2 , 3 , and 5 suggest that they still have significant amount of dust and gas in their disks .    br@xmath7 emission is a well - known tracer of mass accretion @xcite and indicates the existence of gas disks very close to the central stars ( @xmath820.1au ; @xcite ) .",

    "in general , young clusters have high intra - cluster extinctions with large dispersions on a timescale of embedded phase ( about 2 to 3myrs ; @xcite ) : @xmath45 from 0 mag to @xmath125100mag for the age of 1myr , @xmath45 from 0 mag to 510mag for the age of 23myr , and @xmath45 from 0 mag to @xmath8224mag for the age of @xmath314myr of 0.3mag .",

    "therefore , the molecular component can cause the intra - cluster extinction of only @xmath943mag at most even if the cluster is located in the molecular component .",
    "compared to the intra - cluster extinction dispersions of young nearby clusters , the age of the cluster is suggested to be @xmath194myr , at least .",
    "distant clusters can also have large extinction dispersions only due to foreground components , clouds of atomic gas and/or molecular clouds : e.g. @xmath95mag for rsgc 1 @xcite712myr old cluster with identical distance ( @xmath16kpc ) and the size ( @xmath11.5arcmin radius ) to the quartet .",

    "<S> because this cluster has a typical cluster mass of @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3 as opposed to very massive clusters , which have been observed in previous studies ( @xmath4@xmath5@xmath3 ) , we can avoid intra - cluster effects such as strong uv field from ob stars . </S>",
    "<S> although the age of the quartet is previously estimated to be 38myr old , we find that it is most likely @xmath134.5myr old . in moderately deep jhk images from the ukidss survey , we found eight haebe candidates in the cluster , and performed k - band medium - resolution ( @xmath6 ) spectroscopy for three of them with the subaru 8.2 m telescope . </S>",
