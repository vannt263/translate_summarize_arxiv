    "however for gauge theories the regularization provided by the cut - off explicitly break gauge invariance so that the dimensional regularization is better suited for them . in the next section we will review the calculation of the effective potential in the dimensional regularization and define the so - called @xmath0 scheme .",

    "the integrals have singularities which arise as poles in @xmath135 and have to be subtracted out .",
    "the particular prescription for subtraction is called a * renormalization scheme*. in working with the effective potential it is customary to use the so - called @xmath0 renormalization scheme  @xcite .",

    "analogous to the case of the field @xmath2 , the two loop corrections to the @xmath677-potential are dominated by gluon and stop loops and are approximately given by @xmath831 \\log\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_u}{u}\\right)\\ ] ] where , as in the higgs case , the scale @xmath832 may only be obtained after the finite corrections to the effective potential are computed  @xcite .",
    "once the effective potential in the @xmath2 and @xmath677 directions are computed , one can study the strength of the electroweak phase transition , as well as the presence of potential color breaking minima . at one - loop",
    ", it was observed that requiring the stability of the physical vacuum at zero temperature was enough to assure the absolute stability of the potential at finite temperature . as has been first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , once two loop corrections are included , the situation is more complicated  @xcite .",
    "at zero temperature the minimization of the effective potential for the fields @xmath2 and @xmath677 shows that the true minima are located for vanishing values of one of the two fields .",
    "the two set of minima are connected through a family of saddle points for which both fields acquire non - vanishing values .",
    "due to the nature of the high temperature corrections , we do not expect a modification of this conclusion at finite temperature .",
    "two parameters control the presence of color breaking minima : @xmath833 , defined as the smallest value of @xmath834 for which a color breaking minimum deeper than the electroweak breaking minimum is present at @xmath835 , and @xmath836 , the critical temperature for the transition into a color breaking minimum in the @xmath677-direction .",
    "the value of @xmath833 may be obtained by analysing the effective potential for the field @xmath677 at zero temperature , and it is approximately given by  @xcite @xmath837    defining the critical temperature as that at which the potential at the symmetry preserving and broken minima are degenerate , four situations can happen in the comparison of the critical temperatures along the @xmath2 ( @xmath528 ) and @xmath677 ( @xmath836 ) transitions : * a ) * @xmath838 ; @xmath839 ; * b ) * @xmath838 ; @xmath840 ; * c ) * @xmath841 ; @xmath839 ; * d ) * @xmath841 ; @xmath840 .    in case a ) , as the universe cools down , a phase transition into a color preserving minimum occurs , which remains stable until @xmath835 .",
    "this situation , of absolute stability of the physical vacuum , is the most conservative requirement to obtain electroweak baryogenesis . in case",
    "b ) , at @xmath835 the color breaking minimum is deeper than the physical one implying that the color preserving minimum becomes unstable for finite values of the temperature , with @xmath560 . a physically acceptable situation may only occur if the lifetime of the physical vacuum is smaller than the age of the universe .",
    "we shall denote this situation as metastability  . in case c ) , as the universe cools down , a color breaking minimum develops which , however , becomes metastable as the temperature approaches zero .",
    "a physically acceptable situation can only take place if a two step phase transition occurs , that is if the color breaking minimum has a lifetime lower than the age of the universe at some temperature @xmath842  @xcite .",
    "finally , in case d ) the color breaking minimum is absolutely stable and hence , the situation becomes physically unacceptable .",
    "figure  [ mexico ] shows the region of parameter space consistent with a sufficiently strong phase transition for @xmath843 gev . for low values of the mixing , @xmath844 gev , case a ) or c ) may occur but",
    ", contrary to what happens at one - loop , case b ) is not realized . for the case of no mixing , this result is in agreement with the analysis of  @xcite .",
    "the region of absolute stability of the physical vacuum for @xmath845 is bounded to values of the higgs mass of order 95 gev .",
    "there is a small region at the right of the solid line , in which a two - step phase transition may take place , for values of the parameters which would lead to @xmath846 for @xmath847 , but may evolve to larger values at some @xmath842 at which the second of the two step phase transition into the physical vacuum takes place .",
    "this region disappears for larger values of the stop mixing mass parameter . for values of the mixing parameter @xmath848 between 200 gev and 300 gev , both situations , cases b ) and c ) may occur , depending on the value of @xmath810 . for large values of the stop mixing , @xmath849 gev",
    ", a two - step phase transition does not take place .    all together , and even demanding absolute stability of the physical vacuum , electroweak baryogenesis seems to work for a wide region of higgs and stop mass values .",
    "higgs masses between the present experimental limit , of about 90 gev , and around 105  gev are consistent with this scenario .",
    "similarly , the running stop mass may vary from values of order 165 gev ( of the same order as the top quark mass one ) and 100 gev .",
    "observe that , due to the influence of the d - terms , values of @xmath850 gev , @xmath845 and @xmath851 gev , are achieved for small positive values of @xmath852 . also observe that for lower values of @xmath809 the phase transition may become more strongly first order and slightly larger values of the stop masses may be obtained .",
    "remind that these results are based on the two - loop improved effective potential .",
    "recent non - perturbative calculations  @xcite confirm the validity of these perturbative results .",
