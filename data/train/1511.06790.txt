    "the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; * ? ? ? * ) will take about 15 tb of image data per night and after ten years of operations will have 15petabytes of catalog data for the final data release and 0.5exabytes of image data . we are writing a suite of software packages to enable these data products to be created with sufficient quality and performance to meet the established science goals @xcite .",
    "the science pipeline software will enable two key components of the data management system .",
    "the alert production pipelines ( also known as _ level 1 _ ) process the data from the telescope and publish alerts to the community within 60 seconds of data acquisition @xcite .",
    "data release production ( _ level 2 _ ) is responsible for the annual data releases which reprocess all the data each year to generate the best possible catalogs .",
    "both these systems will be integrated with the calibration products production that continuously calculates the best calibrations for the pipelines .",
    "the software will also provide a toolkit for user - supplied code that can be used to efficiently and effectively analyze lsst data as part of _ level 3 _ processing or their own pipelines .",
    "full details of the data management applications design are detailed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the lsst data management science pipelines software system , commonly referred to as the `` stack '' , is a collection of about 40 separate packages providing functionality such as data access libraries , data models representing exposures and catalogs , source detection algorithms , astrometry fitting , and photometry and measurement algorithms .",
    "the software is written in a mixture of python and c++ , where the latter is used for cpu - intensive algorithms , or when the algorithms require access to complex data structures .",
    "the codebase consists of approximately 100,000 lines of python and 110,000 lines of c++ ( not including comment or blank lines and not counting expanded swig ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) interface code ) .",
    "the science pipeline packages are namespaced ( with an ` lsst.`root ) and grouped by their functionality .",
    "the core namespaces are defined as follows :    * daf * : :    the data access framework is responsible for mediating between the    archive resources and the application writer .",
    "the pipeline code has a    completely abstract view of file i / o and only has to know how to deal    with data objects representing fundamental types such as exposures and    tables .",
    "currently fits is the internal format but the system is    designed such that the internal format could be changed to hdf5 , for    example , and no changes would have to be made to the science pipeline    code .",
    "this abstraction of the files from the code protects us against    shifts in community preferences such as those discussed in @xcite . *",
    "afw * : :    the astronomy framework provides the core classes for manipulating    exposures and catalogs , including detecting sources and world    coordinate handling .",
    "* ip * : :    these are the image processing classes , including packages for    instrument signature removal and image differencing .",
    "* meas * : :    the measurement packages include code for determining source    properties and correcting astrometry and photometry . * obs * : :    these classes provide instrument - specific knowledge to the software    system , providing information to the data access framework to teach it    how to interpret data from a range of optical cameras",
    ". the ` obs `    packages currently support data from some instruments on subaru and    cfht , in addition to simulated lsst data .",
    "work is ongoing to add    support for decam . *",
    "pipe * : :    pipeline infrastructure and tasks .",
    "a task is the name for a core    processing component that can be chained with other tasks to build a    pipeline .",
    "more details concerning the history behind the development of the lsst software can be found in @xcite .",
    "whilst the software is open source and can be installed at any time , lsst makes formal releases of the science pipeline software at the end of each six month development cycle in the spring and autumn .",
    "the most recent release covered the summer development cycle and was labeled _ summer 2015 _ and released in september 2015 .",
    "detailed release notes can be found online ; here we provide a summary .",
    "[ [ multi - band - processing - for - coadds ] ] multi - band processing for coadds + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    new command - line tasks have been added for consistent multi - band processing of coadds .",
    "this new data processing flow carefully combines source measurements taken in multiple bands to guarantee consistent deblending across all bands , including when carrying out forced photometry , thereby enabling reliable color measurement , and ensuring that all sources are measured in each band , regardless of the bands where they are detected .",
    "[ [ upgraded - astrometry - calculation ] ] upgraded astrometry calculation + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    previously astrometry was calculated using astrometry.net code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ascl:1208.001 ) and related catalogs distributed by lsst . to improve flexibility in the code",
    "the astrometry fitter is now pluggable and now includes an alternative implementation .",
    "[ [ support - for - psfex ] ] support for psfex + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    psfex ( ascl:1301.001 ) is currently the state of the art external package for point spread function ( psf ) determination , used in projects such as des @xcite .",
    "lsst wrappers were created such that psfex could be used as a plugin in place of the built in psf determiner .",

    "this release saw significant improvements in performance when using very large footprints .

    "this catalog allows the use of the source s heavy footprints to replace neighbors with noise in forced photometry , thus providing deblended forced photometry and consistent deblending across all bands .",
    "this provides much better colors for blended objects as well as measurements for drop - out objects that do not get detected in the canonical band .",
    "this functionality has been enabled for forced coadd photometry .",

    "this release comes with some major enhancements to the internals of ` afw.table ` and , in particular , much better support for compound fields ( such as right ascension / declination tuples ) .

    "the intention is for the next release to include support for the firefly visualization tool @xcite .",
    "the software is known to work on centos 6 and 7 , recent debians and mac os x yosemite and mavericks ( this release is known not to work on mac os x el capitan due to interactions between library path environment variables and the new system integrity protection feature ; this has been fixed in the current development version ) , with a c++11 compatible compiler such as gcc 4.8.3 or later , or apple ` clang ` 6 . the recommended way to install the software from source is to use the ` eups ` distribution installation system @xcite .",
    "experimental binary releases have also been made available using a cernvm file system ( cernvm - fs ; * ? ? ?",
    "full details on both these options are available on the release notes page .",
    "the summer 2015 release of the lsst software stack is the result of the efforts of the many people who are part of the data management team at lsst , as well as outside contributors .",
