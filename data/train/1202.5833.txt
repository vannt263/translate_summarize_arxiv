    "ultra - relativistic flows play important roles in some astrophysical phenomena like @xmath0-ray bursts where fire balls with the lorentz factors exceeding 100 are thought to drive the phenomena .",
    "there are several self - similar solutions involving such ultra - relativistic flows .",
    "@xcite found self - similar solutions for flows resulting from point explosions in the relativistic limit . adopting their prescription ,",
    "@xcite described the shock emergence from a plane - parallel atmosphere .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found relativistic version of the spherical flow relevant to young supernova remnants in which ejecta interact with the circumstellar matter ( csm ) through two shock waves and the contact surface in between . here",
    "we present a new self - similar solution describing flows associated with ejecta expanding into the csm in somewhat different manner .",
    "a shock wave propagating in the csm leads the jet and forms a dense shell detaching itself from the homologously expanding ejecta .",
    "the inner wave front is a rarefaction wave propagating into the ejecta .",
    "this phase follows the spreading phase where the dense shell expands almost freely @xcite and precedes the phase described by @xcite .",
    "a similar flow has been observed in 2-d axisymmetric simulations for jets driven by aspherical supernova explosions @xcite though detailed analyses of the structure of the jet in the radial direction is prohibited by coarse grids to cover the large dynamic range .",
    "it is expected from the same calculation that the propagation of the ultra - relativistic jet in the vicinity of the axis of symmetry is well approximated by the corresponding flow assuming spherical symmetry because the fluxes of mass , momentum , and energy as well as the pressure gradient in the lateral direction are too small to affect the structure and propagation of the jet .",
    "therefore a spherically symmetric solution presented in this paper will be useful to investigate the radial structure of jets near the axis of symmetry .",
    "in the next section , we discuss initial conditions to realize the flow described by the self - similar solution presented in this paper . in section [ sec : urf ] , we present the basic equations governing the ultra - relativistic flows in spherical symmetry . in section [ sec : ejecta ] , we describe the density and pressure distributions of the ejecta . in section [ sec : rarefaction ] , we formulate the flow propagating in the ejecta using a prescription similar to that presented in @xcite . in section [ sec : shock ] , we discuss the propagation of the shock in the csm using the self - similar solution found by @xcite . the boundary conditions at the contact surface are given in section [ sec : boundary ] .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the results . in section [ sec : cd ] , we conclude the paper .",
    "in the non - relativistic limit , a collision of supersonic ejecta with the csm results in two shock waves with a contact surface in between if the relative velocity @xmath1 satisfies the inequality @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the pressure in the ejecta , @xmath4 the proper mass density of the csm , and @xmath5 the adiabatic index , which is assumed as @xmath6 in the rest of the paper .",
    "this inequality usually holds in supernovae . in reality ,",
    "young supernova remnants like cassiopeia a are known to have such a structure @xcite . on the other hand , in the ultra - relativistic limit , a similar argument yields a different condition for leading to two shock waves , that is , @xmath7 here the velocity is measured in units of the speed of light @xmath8 .    to validate this condition ,",
    "we solve the shock tube problems with parameters satisfying and not satisfying the above condition and present the results in figure 1 . in the left panel , two fluids with the density @xmath9",
    "are in contact at the position @xmath10 at the time @xmath11 .",
    "the fluid in the region @xmath12 having the pressure @xmath13 moves in the positive @xmath14 direction with the lorentz factor @xmath15 , while the fluid in the region @xmath16 is at rest and has the pressure @xmath17 . therefore these satisfy the above condition ( [ eqn : cond ] ) for two shock waves and the resultant flow in the figure at @xmath18 actually shows two shock waves . here the plotted pressure is scaled by a factor of @xmath19 and the velocity is measured in units of the speed of light . if the pressure in the right fluid is enhanced by a factor of two , the initial configuration does not satisfy the condition for two shock waves and results in the flow pattern presented in the right panel at @xmath18 . however , it should be noted here that the criterion ( [ eqn : cond ] ) does not accurately define the boundary of these two flow patterns and should be regarded as an approximate guide line to guess the resulting flow pattern from initial conditions .    the value of the right hand side of this condition ( [ eqn : cond ] ) could be estimated for a collision of ejecta with a stationary stellar wind in spherical geometry as @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the distance from the explosion site in units of @xmath22 cm , @xmath23 the temperature of the ejecta in units of @xmath24 k , @xmath25 the wind velocity in units of @xmath26 cm s@xmath27 blown by the progenitor star , and @xmath28 is the mass loss rate in units of @xmath29 yr@xmath27 .",
    "if this condition is relaxed due to the decrease of the temperature when the forward shock propagates outward , the reverse shock will be eventually generated .",
    "therefore we will present a self - similar solution for the spherically symmetric flow composed of a shock wave propagating in the csm and a rarefaction wave in the ejecta resulting from the collision .",
    "this phase precedes the reverse shock phase described by the solution of @xcite .",
    "since the scale of the structure is very small , i.e. , on the order of @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the lorentz factor of the shock wave , this solution describes fine structures of axisymmetric jets in the radial direction near the symmetry axis that multi - dimensional numerical simulations hardly resolve .",
    "the spherically symmetric flow moving at speed @xmath32 is governed by the following equations in the relativistic limit @xcite , @xmath33 here @xmath34 and @xmath35 denote the radial and time coordinates .",
    "the lagrange derivative is described by @xmath36 .",
    "the pressure is denoted by @xmath37 and the ultra - relativistic equation of state @xmath38 has been assumed . the mass density in the fixed frame is denoted by @xmath39 , which is related to the mass density @xmath40 in the co - moving frame as @xmath41 , where @xmath0 is the lorentz factor of the fluid element .    in constructing the self - similar solution",
    ", we follow the procedure of @xcite with different inner boundary conditions .",
    "homologously expanding ejecta resulting from a shock emerging from the stellar surface have a power law structure in terms of the lorentz factor of the fluid element as @xcite and @xcite clearly showed .",
    "the velocity @xmath1 of homologous ejecta at distance @xmath34 and time @xmath35 is defined as , @xmath42 the corresponding lorentz factor is @xmath43 the mass density of the ejecta follows the power law in terms of the lorentz factor as , @xmath44 where a non - dimensional parameter @xmath45 and a constant @xmath46 have been introduced .",
    "the pressure is assumed to have a polytropic expression with a varying coefficient @xmath47 , @xmath48 in @xcite , the pressure in the homologous ejecta was neglected because a strong shock wave propagates in the ejecta . in this paper , a rarefaction wave",
    "is assumed to propagate in the ejecta and we need to specify the pressure distribution .",
    "suppose that the front of the rarefaction wave is located at @xmath49 at time @xmath35",
    ". then the boundary conditions are described as @xmath50 the rarefaction front propagates at a speed @xmath51 . following the prescription of @xcite , the corresponding lorentz factor @xmath52",
    "is assumed to depend on time as @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are constants .",
    "therefore @xmath56 is approximated by @xmath57 using this expression , other variables in the ejecta at @xmath49 are expressed as @xmath58 the coefficient @xmath59 is assumed to be @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are constants . using these dimensional variables at the front , non - dimensional variables",
    "@xmath64 are introduced as follows .",
    "@xmath65 here a non - dimensional coordinate @xmath66 was defined as @xmath67(1-r / t)$ ] so that the rarefaction front is located at @xmath68 . since the rarefaction wave propagates at the sound speed equal to @xmath69 relative to the matter in the relativistic limit , the lorentz factors of the rarefaction front and the ejecta there are related with each other as @xmath70 thus the parameter @xmath55 is evaluated as @xmath71 .",
    "the conversion of coordinate system @xmath72 to @xmath73 is described as @xmath74\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\xi},&\\\\ & \\frac{d}{d\\ln t}=-m\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\ln\\gamma_1 ^ 2}+\\left[\\frac{1}{g}-(m+1)\\xi\\right]\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\xi}.&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we retain only leading terms , the resultant hydrodynamical equations deduced from equations ( [ rhydro1])-([rhydro3 ] ) become three ordinary differential equations .",

    "finally , we will present equations governing the self - similar flow in the shocked csm and the associated boundary conditions . these are identical to those in @xcite .      the mass density , lorentz factor , and pressure change across a strong shock wave propagating at a speed @xmath76 by the following relations . @xmath77 where the subscript 1 refers to the values in the shocked fluid at the shock front , the subscript i the values in the un - shocked external medium at the shock front .",
    "@xmath78 denotes the lorentz factor of the shock front . to maintain the self - similarity , the lorentz factor of the shock front @xmath31 needs to evolve as @xmath52 and",
    "is assumed to depend on time as @xmath79 .",
    "here @xmath80 is a constant .",
    "the mass density in the csm is assumed to have a power law distribution as @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants .",
    "non - dimensional self - similar variables for the pressure @xmath84 , the lorentz factor @xmath85 , and the mass density @xmath86 are defined as @xmath87 where the similarity variable @xmath88 has been introduced as @xmath89      by substituting the expressions ( [ p@def])-([h@def ] ) into equations ( [ rhydro1])-([rhydro3 ] ) , equations governing the self - similar flow in the shocked csm are obtained as @xmath90 because @xmath71 , the similarity solution is uniquely determined by specifying the parameter @xmath83 .",
    "at the contact surface , the density distribution has a discontinuity while the pressure and the velocity are continuously distributed .",
    "since the pressures in equations ( [ p@def ] ) and ( [ p@e ] ) need to evolve with the same power of time @xmath35 , we obtain the relation @xmath91 using this relation in equations ( [ f@e ] ) and ( [ g@e ] ) , the dependences of these equations on the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath45 are eliminated .",
    "the continuous distribution of pressure at the contact surface also relates the introduced constants as @xmath92the denominators of ( [ h@a ] ) and ( [ h@e ] ) indicate @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 denote the coordinates of the contact surface .    from the continuity of the lorentz factors at the contact surface , equations ( [ g@def ] ) and ( [ g@e ] )",
    "yield the ratio of lorentz factors of the two wave fronts as @xmath96 the asymptotic behavior of the density near the contact surface is described as @xmath97 the former equation indicates that the density in the csm diverges if @xmath98 , otherwise the density in the csm becomes zero at the contact surface . from the latter equation , when @xmath99 , i.e. , the csm has a uniform density , the density in the ejecta diverges at the contact surface if @xmath100 .",
    "when @xmath101 , i.e. , the csm is formed by a stationary stellar wind , the density in the ejecta diverges at the contact surface if @xmath102 .",
    "results with a combination of parameters @xmath103 are presented in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "the other parameters are as follows : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 in cgs units .",
    "these values are obtained from ejecta having the lorentz factor of 300 , the temperature of @xmath108 k , and the density of @xmath109 g @xmath110 at the front .",
    "the ejecta collide at @xmath111 with the stationary wind with the mass loss rate of @xmath112 yr@xmath27 .",
    "the wind velocity is assumed to be @xmath113 cm s@xmath27 .",
    "the plotted pressure , lorentz factor , and density are normalized by those values at the shock front in the csm .",
    "note that the density profile on the left side of the contact surface in this plot changes with time while the other profiles remain unchanged with time .    from the obtained solutions",
    ", we can derive a relation between the lorentz factor and pressure of the ejecta and the density of the csm near the wave as @xmath114 by using equations ( [ eqn : k ] ) and ( [ eqn : fg ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath115 ranges from 2.2 to 4.5 for the parameter range of @xmath116 with a fixed @xmath117 , for example .",
    "therefore the solutions satisfy the criterion ( [ eqn : cond ] ) though we have rarefaction waves rather than reverse shock waves . again , we should recognize the inequality ( [ eqn : cond ] ) as an approximate guide line to classify the flow patterns resulting from initial discontinuities partly because of the inhomogeneous structure of the flow .",
    "[ profile ]",
    "we have presented a new self - similar solution describing the early phase of collision between spherical ejecta expanding at ultra - relativistic speeds and the csm .",
    "the flow is characterized by the forward shock propagating in the csm , the contact surface , and the rarefaction front with a weak discontinuity propagating in the ejecta . as the forward shock proceeds in the csm , a reverse shock eventually forms .",
    "then another self - similar solution by @xcite appropriately describes the flow afterwards .",
    "though these solutions assume spherical symmetry , they can be used to describe flows of relativistic jets in the vicinity of the axis of symmetry since the 2-d numerical simulations show that the flux in the transverse direction is negligible there .    when the rarefaction described by the present solution is transformed into the reverse shock depends on the structures of ejecta and the csm .",
    "if the ejecta are isothermal , the condition ( [ eqn : cond ] ) together with equation ( [ eqn : ncond ] ) suggests that the transition occurs at time @xmath118 sec .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath1190.2 sec in the observer s frame . in reality , higher temperature or pressure in the inner ejecta will prolong the duration of this phase . in the self - similar solution presented in this paper , the distribution of pressure @xmath120 in the ejecta has a form of @xmath121 if the actual pressure distribution deviates from this and becomes shallower , then the transition is expected to occur .",
    "the transition indicates a change of the time dependence of the shock lorentz factor .",
    "it will be intriguing to investigate influences of this change on the emission in connection with light curve features of some gamma - ray bursts .",
    "for example , grb 110205a exhibits a steep rise in its optical light curve starting at a few hundred seconds after the detection while the x - ray light curve shows a small bump around the same period @xcite .",
    "this might be related to the transition taking place at @xmath122 cm from the explosion site and associated deceleration of the shock front , though calculations of the emission from such a shocked relativistic matter is beyond the scope of the present paper ."
