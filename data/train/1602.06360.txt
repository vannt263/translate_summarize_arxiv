    "in solid structures , the competition arises when two or more physical parameters tend to favor states with different symmetry , periodicity or structure .",
    "accordingly , this kind of competition creates interesting magnetic phases .",
    "for instance , the crystal cerium antimonide @xmath13 is a @xmath14-like alloy , in which ions of @xmath15 and @xmath16 occupy alternate vertices of a cubic lattice .",
    "its phase - diagram shows various magnetics structures @xcite that have been explained by the annni model , whose ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interaction favours a homogeneous arrangement of spins , while the antiferromagnetic coupling prefers the periodic arrangement of two spins up , two down and so on @xcite .",
    "thus , systems with competing interactions show interesting properties @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , there is a special interest in studying spin models with competing short- and long - range interactions .",
    "it is important to mention that the ising model in the mean - field approach is equivalent to the ising model in which all pairs of spins are coupled with the same constant @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the total number of spins @xcite .",
    "baker reported that siegert was the first to show him this fact @xcite .",
    "therefore , these are called mean - field interactions or infinite - range interactions .",
    "their utility is for representing long - range interactions due to the fact that the ising model is exactly solved with them .",
    "also , baker showed that even in the presence of short - range interactions , the existence of any coupling of infinitely long range is sufficient to change the nature of the transition to be that of mean - field type @xcite .",
    "there is also an interest in investigating spin models with competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings of long and short range , motivated by the multicritical behavior that may appear .",
    "an early attention for this kind of competition was given by nagle @xcite who showed the existence of a spontaneous magnetization between two non - zero temperatures in a linear spin@xmath19 chain .",
    "so , if the ferromagnetic couplings have longer range than the antiferromagnetic ones , the ferromagnetic interactions are strong enough to induce order at some temperature interval . another similar work for the ising model is found in a paper published by kardar @xcite .",
    "there he studied a competition between mean - field ferromagnetic interactions and nearest - neighbor interactions for dimension @xmath20 .",
    "if the nearest - neighbor interactions are antiferromagnetic , there is a frontier line in the phase diagram with a tricritical point separating the ferromagnetic phase and the disordered phase , for @xmath21 . for @xmath22 ,",
    "this frontier becomes richer , because now it separates the ferromagnetic phase and two phases with zero magnetization , namely , the antiferromagnetic phase and the disordered phase .",
    "this model was called the nagle - kardar model @xcite .",
    "also , hamiltonians like this , with competing local , nearest - neighbor , and mean - field couplings , have also been solved in both , the canonical and the microcanonical ensemble so as to test ensemble inequivalence @xcite .    in what ising spin-1 models concerns",
    ", it is important to quote the work of u. low , et al .",
    "@xcite , who did a coarse - grained representation of frustrated phase separation in high temperature superconductors , by using the following hamiltonian :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 are spins in a square lattice , and @xmath25 .",
    "note that the spins in the first term are coupled by positive long - range interactions of coulomb type , whereas in the second term the spins are coupled with negavite nearest neighbors interactions .",
    "so , it emerges a competition between the two terms , which tend to align the spins in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the third term is the term of anisotropy , which controls the number of sites at which @xmath26 .",
    "the authors found that the ground state presents a complex phase diagram with a rich variety of phases in the @xmath27 plane , for @xmath28 .",
    "recently , a similar hamiltonian was studied for finite temperatures by salmon , sousa and neto @xcite , though they considered mean - field couplings for the ferromagnetic interactions , and one - dimensional nearest - neighbor couplings for the antiferromagnetic interactions . in this case , the expression of the free energy was obtained by using analytical methods .    in this work",
    "we improve the research of this type of competition for the spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model @xcite . in the following section we present the hamiltonian and the details of its statistical mechanic treatment .",
    "we consider a spin-@xmath0 chain with long - range and short - range competing interactions represented by the following hamiltonian :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , for @xmath31 , being @xmath18 the number of spins . the first sum represents the mean - field ferromagnetic interactions , thus , each spin @xmath32 interacts equally with all the @xmath18 spins ( itself included ) , by couplings of strength @xmath33 .",
    "this first sum is responsible for the ferromagnetic order because we set @xmath34 .",
    "the second sum represents the energy of a linear chain of spins interacting between their nearest - neighbors with coupling constant @xmath1 . in order to create a competition between the short - range antiferromagnetic interactions and the long - range ferromagnetic couplings of the first sum",
    ", we consider @xmath28 .",
    "the last sum is the anisotropy term with constant @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . for @xmath37",
    ", we recover the spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model with mean - field ferromagnetic interactions , which is a particular case of the blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) model , where @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that the beg model , for @xmath38 , with dipolar and quadrupolar interactions was introduced to explain phase transitions in the @xmath39 compound @xcite .",
    "also , the blume - capel model for @xmath38 has attracted the antention for its multicritical behavior when considering @xmath40 as a random variable @xcite and when implemented in a two - dimensional lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions in the presence of an external magnetic field @xcite . as a previous step to obtain the phase diagrams of this new version of the nagel - kardar model , we have to determine the analytical expression of the free energy . to this end , we firstly need to calculate the partition function @xmath41 in the canonical ensemble @xcite :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the boltzman constant , @xmath45 stands for the temperature of the system , and @xmath46 indicates the sum over all spin configurations . in this class of interaction the hubbbard - stratonovich transformation  @xcite can be applicable to decouple the spins in the quadratic term in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "accordingly , this transforms the partition function as follows    @xmath47    where @xmath48 .",
    "so , the partition function can be now calculated by using the transfer matrix technique :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the matrix transfer , given by : @xmath51 the trace @xmath52 is equal to @xmath53 , where @xmath54 are the eigenvalues of @xmath55 . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath56 ) , the partition function",
    "is simplified through the steepest descent method , so :    @xmath57    where    @xmath58    being @xmath59 equal to @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the value of @xmath62 that minimizes the function @xmath63 , called the free energy density , for given values of @xmath64 , @xmath40 and @xmath4 .",
    "it can also be proven that @xmath61 is the magnetization of the system at the equilibrium ( see the appendix of reference @xcite ) .",
    "now , with the aid of the free energy density @xmath63 , we can explore the ferromagnetic frontiers and their limits in the @xmath65 plane , knowing that the antiferromagnetic phases are only present for @xmath66 .",
    "so , the only relevant order parameter is the magnetization , which was calculated by finding the minima of the function @xmath63 as a function of @xmath61 in eq.([fdensity ] ) , for given values of @xmath64 , @xmath40 and @xmath4 .",
    "we obtained , numerically , the maximum eigenvalue of the transfer matrix of eq.([transferm ] ) . in order to estimate the points",
    "@xmath67 belonging to the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic frontiers and those ones that divide different ferromagnetic phases , we scanned the magnetization curve @xmath61 versus @xmath64 , by fixing @xmath4 and @xmath40 , and the curve @xmath61 versus @xmath40 , for fixed values of @xmath4 and @xmath64 .",
    "the type of phase transition was determined by analyzing the behavior of the magnetization and free energy at the frontier points .",
    "first - order points are those at which the magnetization suffers a discontinuous change due to the coexistence of different phases , whereas at second - order points the magnetization is continuous .    to plot the frontiers and points of the phase diagrams we use distinct symbols , as described below ( see reference @xcite ) .",
    "* continuous ( second order ) critical frontier : continuous line ; * first - order frontier ( line of coexistent ) : dotted line ; * tricritical point : located by a black circle ; * ordered critical point : located by a black asterisk ;",
    "the typical spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model with mean - field ferromagnetic is recovered by setting @xmath37 , in the hamiltonian given in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) . for this case , the explicit expression of the free energy density in eq.([fdensity ] ) can be easily written down as    @xmath68.\\ ] ]    the landau expansion of the above free energy density is :    @xmath69    where    @xmath70    @xmath71    the explicit expression of the coefficient @xmath72 is too lengthly to be written here .",
    "the magnetization @xmath61 is obtained by extremizing the function @xmath63 , @xmath73 , that leads to the following transcendental equation :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 the second - order frontier of the phase diagram is plotted after solving numerically the equation @xmath76 , with the condition @xmath77 .",
    "there is also a first - order line separating two ferromagnetic phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with diferent values of the magnetization per spin ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "thus , this frontier is obtained by solving the following non - linear set of equations , by the newton - raphson method :    @xmath82    @xmath83    @xmath84    with the initial conditions @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , setting @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding phase diagram in the @xmath91 plane is shown in figure 1 ( see also fig . 2 in reference @xcite ) . there",
    "we can see a second - order frontier whose critical points separate the ferromagnetic phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the paramagnetic phase @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) . at low temperatures , the order parameter @xmath61 ,",
    "takes the values @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath94 , the critical temperature of this frontier remains constant , being @xmath95 .",
    "this can be shown by solving the equation @xmath76 ( see eq.([coefa ] ) ) , when @xmath94 .",
    "the two ordered phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 are divided by a first - order frontier represented by a dotted line .",
    "it begins at @xmath96 , and finishes at and ordered critical point located approximately at @xmath97 , represented by the asterisk .",
    "although this phase diagram has already been shown in past works @xcite , we noted an interesting behavior of the magnetization curve , after crossing through the first - order line . to illustrate this singular behavior ,",
    "we show in figure 2a a short interval of @xmath40 , where we can visualize better the zone of the phase diagram where this line of coexistence appears . the arrow is a guide to the eyes to show the vertical line at wich",
    "the magnetization was plotted in figure 2b . in this case",
    "the arrow begins at @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly , in figure 2b is shown the magnetization versus the temperature , for the convenient value @xmath99 .",
    "the jump discontinuity shows that the magnetization curve has crossed the line of coexistence .",
    "interestingly , we can observe that the magnetization curve increases slightly with the temperature , after crossing this frontier , until reaching a maximum value .",
    "this happens only for values of @xmath40 in the interval for which the line of coexistence is present ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "then the magnetization curve decreases continuously until falling downto zero , signaling that it has crossed the second - order critical frontier separating phases @xmath79 and @xmath92 ( see where the arrow crosses the continuous line in figure 2a ) .",
    "this review of the spin-@xmath0 blume capel with mean - field ferromagnetic couplings is useful to understand how the topology of the phase diagram will evolve by the addition of the second term of the hamiltonian given in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "so , as a previous step , we obtain the phase diagram for @xmath66 and @xmath101 , in the next section .",
    "at zero temperature , the free energy is simply the energy @xmath102 corresponding to the hamiltonian given in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "thus , we have to determine the spin configurations that minimize this energy so as to obtain the phase diagram in the @xmath103 plane , for @xmath36 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to realize that there are four magnetic phases which give us four different values of @xmath102 , that we denote as @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "phases @xmath78 and @xmath108 denote the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders for which the spins have the absolute value @xmath109 , for @xmath110 . on the other hand , phases @xmath79 and @xmath111 denote the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders for which the spin variables have the absolute value @xmath112 , for @xmath110 .",
    "futhermore , the corresponding expressions of @xmath113 depend on the parameters @xmath33 , @xmath35 and @xmath1 , and are obtained according to the hamiltonian presented in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "therefore , the respective energy densities are the following :    @xmath114    @xmath115    @xmath116    @xmath117    now we can get the first - order frontiers separating these different phases by using the above expressions .",
    "thus , the frontier dividing phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 is obtained by equating the expressions of eq.([ef1 ] ) and eq.([ef2 ] ) , resulting in a line whose equation is given by @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , we get the frontier dividing @xmath108 and @xmath111 , which is described by the linear equation @xmath119 , after equating the expressions eq.([eaf1 ] ) and eq.([eaf2 ] )",
    ". we also found a vertical line , where @xmath120 , that separates phases @xmath78 and @xmath108 , as well as phases @xmath79 and @xmath111 , by equating eq.([ef1 ] ) and eq.([eaf1 ] ) , as well as eq.([ef2 ] ) and eq.([eaf2 ] ) . in figure 3",
    "we show these three frontiers meeting themselves at a point of coexistence represented by an empty triangle . in the next section",
    "we describe the results at finite temperatures , for @xmath28 .",
    "it is important to mention that phases @xmath108 and @xmath111 disappear when @xmath121 .",
    "this is because both are caused by the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath1 in the linear chain , then these long - range orders are destroyed in @xmath21 , for @xmath121 .",
    "the frontiers of the phase diagrams for finite temperatures , are obtained by scanning the magnetization per spin @xmath61 throughout the @xmath91 plane , for given values of @xmath1 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the magnetization per spin , is the only relevant order parameter , which the free energy density @xmath63 depends on .",
    "so , for given values of @xmath40 , @xmath64 and @xmath4 , we estimate numerically the value(s ) of @xmath61 , for which @xmath63 has its global minimum ( or minima ) . in this way we can get numerically vertical and horizontal curves of @xmath61 in the @xmath91 plane , so as to determine diferent types of frontiers , namely , first - order and second - order lines , for a given value of @xmath4 . due to the progress of computational power in current machines",
    ", we noted that this is an efficient way to treat directly with the free energy density , for obtaining the phase diagrams . in what follows",
    "we present how the phase diagram of the spin-@xmath0 blume capel model with mean - field ferromagnetic interactions evolves when the antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath28 is taken into account ( see the second term in the hamiltonian given in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "firstly , we show in figure 4 how the second - order frontier which separates the orderes phases and the paramagnetic phase ( see figure 1 ) suffers when @xmath1 is increased . for lower values of @xmath4 ( as for @xmath122 ) ,",
    "the frontier remains of second - order , but for greater values , such as @xmath123 , the frontier is divided into three sections .",
    "the second - order section is limited by two tricritical points , and the sections of the extremes are of first order .",
    "we estimated that for @xmath124 , the tricritical points begin to appear , and they approach themselves as @xmath4 increases , reducing the length of the second - order section .",
    "then , for @xmath125 , the tricritical points meet themselves , and for @xmath126 , the frontier separating the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases is only of first - order , as figure 4 shows .",
    "the increase of @xmath4 affects also the coexistence line that divides the ordered phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "for example , in figure 5 we show the phase diagram for @xmath127 . in figure",
    "5a we see that another line of coexistence ( ending at an ordered critical point ) has emerged , like a branch , from the line divding phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( see the region enclosed by the circle ) . in a similar work for the spin-@xmath0 blume capel model , branches like this has been reported ( see the fig.3 in reference @xcite ) . in figure 5b",
    "we visualize more clearly the portion of the phase diagram containing this branch line .",
    "it begins at a point of coexistence represented by an empty diamond , and encloses a region of a third ordered phase , which we denote as @xmath128 .",
    "accordingly , this branch line divides phases @xmath79 and @xmath128 until its ending point .",
    "its onset has been detected by scanning the magnetization curve versus temperature , for different values of @xmath40 , for given values of @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , in figure 5b , the range in which this line is included is of width @xmath129 .",
    "however , for @xmath130 , this width is of course shorter , as can be deduced from figure 6 , where the magnetization curve has been plotted for three close values of @xmath40 .",
    "there we observe that for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , the magnetization curve is continuous , but for @xmath133 , this suffers three jump discontinuities , which is a signal of the presence of the branch line .",
    "so , for @xmath130 , the width of the range of the branch line is @xmath134 .",
    "so the onset of the branch line must be for @xmath130 , but very close to this value .",
    "thus , for @xmath135 , we proceeded similarly for seeking the intervale of its appearance in the phase diagram , but the branch line was not found in it .",
    "therefore , its onset is estimated for @xmath136 .",
    "the region of the phase diagram containing the richest portion of this topology is especially analyzed in figure 7 , for @xmath137 .",
    "so , in figure 7a we may note the reentrant behavior of the branch line .",
    "the arrows are guides to the eye for signaling where the mangentization is plotted in figures 7c and 7d .",
    "figure 7b is intended to show , through the free energy density , that at the point represented by the empty diamond , whose coordinates are @xmath138 , phases @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath128 coexist .",
    "this is why the free energy density is equally minimized by six values of @xmath61 . for phase @xmath78 , @xmath61 is close to @xmath139 , for phase @xmath79 , @xmath61 is close to @xmath140 , and for phase @xmath128 , @xmath61 is equal to 1 . on the other hand , the magnetization curves in figures 7c and 7d",
    "show the first - order nature of points belonging to the coexistence lines . in figure 7c ,",
    "the magnetization as a function of the temperature , is plotted for @xmath141 ( see the vertical arrow in figure 7a ) .",
    "it suffers three jump discontinuities , because it has crossed the first - order line separating phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and the reentrant zone of the branch line dividing phases @xmath79 and @xmath128 .",
    "this is why there is a short magnetization gap between phases @xmath78 and @xmath128 , where phase @xmath79 is present . for greater values of the temperature",
    ", the magnetization falls continuously downto zero due to the presence of the second - order section of the frontier dividing phases @xmath79 and @xmath92 ( not shown in figure 7a ) . in figure 7d , we plotted @xmath61 versus @xmath40 , for @xmath142 , so as to study the behavior of @xmath61 along the horizontal line marked by the horizontal arrow shown in figure 7a .",
    "this line crosses the vertex of the reentrant curve of the branch frontier .",
    "thus , the magnetization suffers a jump dicontinuity when passing through the transition from phase @xmath128 to phase @xmath79 . for greater values of @xmath4 , the reentrant form of the branch line",
    "also , the ending points of the two lower frontiers and the upper frontier approach themselves , as @xmath4 increases . this can be observed in figure 8 , where we see the asterisks very close to the first - order frontier that separates the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases .",
    "consequently , if @xmath4 is greater than certain critical value @xmath143 , these ending points get to touch the upper first - order frontier . in figure 9",
    "we show this fact in the phase diagram obtained for @xmath144 . there",
    "the ending points of the lower first - order frontiers are now points of coexistence , and these are represented by an empty square and a black square .",
    "thus , the three first - order frontiers completely enclose the phase @xmath128 .",
    "so , for @xmath144 , the coordinates of the point represented by empty square are @xmath145 , and for the black square these are @xmath146 . in order to show the critical behavior at this points of coexistence",
    ", we plotted the free energy density at each of them .",
    "so , in figure 10a , we observe five values of the magnetization equally minimizing the free energy at the point represented by the empty square in figure 9 , showing that phases @xmath78 , @xmath128 and @xmath92 coexist .",
    "similarly , the free energy density plotted in figure 10b is intended to show that phases @xmath128 , @xmath79 and @xmath92 coexist at the point represented by the black square in figure 9 ( see the five global minima therein ) .    finally , for @xmath3 ,",
    "all ordered phases disappear , remaining only phase @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the last topology is that shown in figure 9 . in the next section",
    "we summarize the results of this study .",
    "we have studied , in a linear chain of @xmath18 spins ( @xmath147 ) , the spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model with competing long - and short - range interactions , and anisotropy @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "conveniently , the long - range interactions were represented by mean - field ferromagnetic couplings ( @xmath34 ) , and the short - range interactions were represented by antiferromagnetic couplings ( @xmath28 ) between nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "we obtained the phase diagrams in the @xmath91 plane , for different values of @xmath4 , so as to explore how the topology of the well - known spin-@xmath0 blume - capel model with mean - field ferromagnetic couplings is modified as @xmath4 increases .",
    "as a first step for understanding the results at finite temperatures , we obtained the phase diagram in the @xmath148 plane for @xmath66 .",
    "four magnetic orderings are present , namely , two ferromagnetic phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with @xmath109 and @xmath112 , respectively , and two antiferromagnetic phases @xmath108 and @xmath111 , with @xmath109 and @xmath112 , respectively . for finite temperatures and without competition @xmath149",
    ", the phase diagram in the @xmath91 plane contains an upper second - order frontier dividing the ferromagetic region and the paramagnetic region .",
    "the ferromagnetic region is composed by the two ordered phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 separated by a fisrt - order line ending at an ordered critical point , which is bellow the second - order line .",
    "we started the competition by increasing the value of @xmath4 .",
    "so , the topology of the phase diagram is changed by the modification of the original second - order frontier and the first - order one .",
    "thus , the frontier dividing the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic region remains of second - order approximately for @xmath150 .",
    "then , for @xmath151 , this line is divided by three sections two of them are of first - order , an intermediate second - order section limited by two tricritical points .",
    "the tricritical points approach themselves as @xmath4 increases , so , for @xmath152 this frontier is only of first - order . on the other hand , @xmath153 , the first - order frontier that divides phases @xmath78 and @xmath79 does not suffer any change , however , for greater values of @xmath4 a branch line of first - order emerges from it , ending at an ordered critical point too .",
    "this branch line encloses partially a new phase @xmath128 , whose region is ordered in such a way that the mean magnetization per spin is mostly @xmath154 .",
    "this must be because for each spin @xmath7 with @xmath8(@xmath9 ) , there is another spin @xmath10 with @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , such that the total spin sums one ( minus one ) .",
    "this configuration minimizes the free energy density in that region of the phase diagram .",
    "thus , the branch line grows as @xmath4 increases , and both ending points of the lines dividing phases @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath128 approach the upper first - order frontier . finally , for @xmath155 , the phase @xmath128 is completely enclosed when the ending points touch the upper frontier , so the ordered region is now divided in three separated zones corresponding to @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , this last topology contains three points of coexistence .",
    "the lower point , at which the branch line begins , meets phases @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath128 , whereas the upper points , one on the left and the other on the right , meet phases @xmath78 , @xmath128 and @xmath92 , and @xmath128 , @xmath79 and @xmath92 , respectively . for @xmath3 ,",
