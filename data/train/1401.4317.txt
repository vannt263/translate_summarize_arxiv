    "in a competitive global market , a manufacturer usually needs to provide a wide variety of products with a short amount of lead time to improve customer satisfaction and increase market share .",
    "when an order from a customer arrives , differentiation to the tailored order is often postponed down the assembly line to achieve both product variety and short lead time . in general , the more diverse a product , the longer lead time it requires .",
    "modularization and postponement ( or delayed differentiation ) can be an effective means to reduce the lead time while maintaining a wide variety of products .",
    "many modularization and postponement studies have shown that these concepts offer an advantage in terms of reducing uncertainty and forecasting errors with regard to demand  @xcite in addition to creating product variety and customization at low cost  @xcite . thus , modularization and postponement have become important concepts in the market to provide better service to customers and make the business process more efficient .    in a product line such as computer retailing or automobile assembly , concepts of modularization and postponement are realized by an assembly process that consists of a semi - finished product `` vanilla box '' and optional components that are directly used in the final assembly .",
    "the vanilla box consists of components , known as the commonality of parts , needed to assemble the final product with appropriate optional components , and the vanilla box approach has been shown to be effective under high variance  @xcite",
    ".    applications of modularization and postponement to an inventory system require a multi - item model in which the demand of each of the several optional components depends on the demand or the presence of the vanilla box .",
    "the vanilla box represents the customer s stochastic demand , and optional components , in turn , depend on the demand of the vanilla box for final assembly .",
    "thus , the demands of the vanilla box and optional components are stochastically correlated . as the inventory model becomes complicated because of the correlation , it is desirable to find an efficient and accurate method to solve the model system .    a multi - item inventory model was proposed to comply with the concept of modularization and postponement  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of a vanilla box and optional components in which the correlation between the two types of items is implemented as a bivariate gaussian probability distribution whereas the optional components are independent of each other .",
    "this model handles a continuous review inventory system in which an order quantity @xmath0 is placed whenever an inventory level reaches a certain reorder point @xmath1 under the presence of service level and budget constraints .",
    "subsequently , a stochastic payment is also included in the model in such a manner that the total inventory cost does not exceed a predetermined budget  @xcite .    in this paper , we propose an efficient method to solve a correlated multi - item continuous review inventory model in which the correlation between the vanilla box and an optional component is represented by a bivariate gaussian probability distribution . by using appropriate normalizations of the demands of items ,",
    "we show that the set of equations coupled with the vanilla box and optional components can be reduced to sets of decoupled equations for each item .",
    "furthermore , each set of decoupled equations is simplified in a closed form and solved without any approximation .",
    "thus , the equations for each item can be solved independently of each other .    the conventional method for solving such a model system",
    "is based on a heuristic of combining a newton  raphson method and a hadley ",
    "whitin iterative procedure  @xcite . at each iteration",
    ", a candidate solution is found by using the newton - raphson method in which numerical integrations are carried out where required .",
    "the iteration proceeds until both @xmath0 and @xmath1 sufficiently converge .",
    "briefly , the conventional method takes the set of simultaneous equations for @xmath0 s and @xmath1 s as a whole and utilizes heuristic approximating procedures .",
    "given that the conventional method uses a rather complicated approximation and iteration , it requires heavy computation time .",
    "in contrast , the proposed method does not rely on any approximation or heuristics . as a result ,",
    "the solution procedure for the proposed method is much simpler , more accurate , and offers shorter computing time than the conventional method .",
    "we apply the proposed method to a correlated multi - item continuous review inventory model to demonstrate its usefulness .",
    "we also perform a sensitivity analysis in terms of the correlation to further characterize the behavior of the order quantity and reorder point of optional components .",
    "in addition , the proposed scheme can be used as a dependable method for a more generalized multi - item continuous review inventory model with much more complicated correlations among items .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",

    "furthermore , we allow multiple optional components and each optional component is dependent on the vanilla box through a bivariate gaussian probability distribution , whereas optional components are independent of each other .",
    "a bivariate gaussian probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the random variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the demand for the vanilla box and the @xmath4th optional component , respectively , is given by @xmath5 here , the variable vector @xmath6 , the mean vector @xmath7 , the covariance matrix @xmath8 , and the correlation coefficient @xmath9 between @xmath2 and @xmath3 are expressed , respectively , as @xmath10,~ \\vec{\\mu}=\\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\mu_{v } \\\\ \\mu_{j } \\end{array } \\right ] , ~\\sigma=\\left [    \\begin{array}{cc } \\sigma_{v}^{2 } & \\sigma_{vj } \\\\",

    "this implies that the conditional pdf of @xmath3 is evaluated at @xmath17 .",

    "( [ gau2 ] ) that the normalization decomposes the bivariate pdf into a product of two pdfs of @xmath22 and @xmath20 , both of which can be regarded as independent standard _ univariate _",
    "this implies that the notion of the conditional pdf does not exist and there is no distinction between dependent and independent items . in what follows ,",
    "we take a correlated multi - item continuous review inventory system as an illustration of the advantage of normalization .",
    "the illustrative model we consider in this paper is a correlated multi - item continuous review inventory system that includes two types of items : a vanilla box and many optional components .",
    "furthermore , as stated in section [ norm ] , each optional component depends on the vanilla box through a bivariate gaussian probability distribution .",
    "we use the following notations to formulate the model :    * @xmath23 : fixed procuring cost , * @xmath24 : unit variable procurement cost , * @xmath25 : expected annual demand , * @xmath26 : carrying cost , * @xmath27 : unit shortage cost , * @xmath28 : service cost rate , and * @xmath29 : available budget limit .    note that each of these terms can be used for both the vanilla box and optional components whenever possible .",
    "we distinguish the vanilla box from the @xmath4th optional component by the subscripts @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "for instance , @xmath32 and @xmath33 represent the fixed procuring costs of the vanilla component and the @xmath4th optional component , respectively .",
    "the model is composed of the sum of the expected average annual cost ( eac ) of the two types of items under budgetary constraint .",

    "<S> furthermore , the set of equations coupled with different items can be decoupled in such a way that the order quantity and reorder point for each item can be evaluated independently from those of the other . as a result , in contrast to conventional methods , the solution procedure for the proposed method can be much simpler and more accurate without any approximation . to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method </S>",
    "<S> , we present a solution scheme for a multi - item continuous review inventory model in which the demand of optional components depend on that of a `` vanilla box , '' representing the customer s stochastic demand , under stochastic payment and budget constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the dependence of order quantities and reorder points on the correlation coefficient . </S>"
