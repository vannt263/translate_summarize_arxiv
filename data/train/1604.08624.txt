    "insights about nuclear structure can often be found by examining the systematic behavior of a series of isotopes or isotones , and the advent of intense beams of exotic isotopes has opened new opportunities for such systematic studies . in the present work ,",
    "we examine the systematic behavior of both octupole and quadrupole modes in the neutron - rich isotopes of calcium by means of inelastic scattering of protons in inverse kinematics .",
    "we report the results of inelastic proton scattering experiments on @xmath2ca , and combine these results with previous results on @xmath3ca  @xcite to examine quadrupole and octupole excitations in the a=48 - 52 ca isotopes .",
    "while the energies of the @xmath4 states in @xmath5ca , which have large neutron excitation components , vary dramatically with neutron number , the energies of the @xmath6 states in these isotopes are remarkably constant , demonstrating that these octupole states are dominated by proton excitations .    furthermore , the inelastic proton scattering reaction on the odd - n isotopes @xmath7ca allows us to identify members of multiplets that result from coupling of the odd neutron ( in the case of @xmath8ca ) or neutron hole ( in the case of @xmath9ca ) to the octupole phonons in @xmath10ca .",
    "the deformation lengths for scattering to the multiplet members in @xmath7ca can be explained in a simple weak - coupling picture , once again confirming the dominant proton character of the octupole phonons in the core nuclei .",
    "the experiment was performed at the coupled - cyclotron facility of the national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university .",
    "a cocktail beam was produced by the fragmentation of a 130  mev / u @xmath11ge primary beam in a 376  mg/@xmath12 @xmath13be production target .",
    "the secondary products were separated by the a1900 fragment separator  @xcite .",
    "the momentum acceptance of the a1900 was 3% .",
    "a 45  mg/@xmath12 aluminum achromatic wedge was used to enhance separation of the cocktail by @xmath14 .",
    "secondary beam particles were identified by energy loss in a silicon surface barrier detector and by their time of flight .",
    "the beam then traversed the ursinus college liquid hydrogen target , based on the design of ryuto et al .",
    "the target was installed at the pivot point of the s800 magnetic spectrograph  @xcite .",
    "projectile - like reaction products were identified by energy loss in the s800 ion chamber and time of flight .",
    "the secondary beam , composed of products spanning the range @xmath15 , included @xmath2ca , the subjects of the present work .",
    "total numbers of beam particles , average rates , and mid - target energies are given in table  [ tab : beam ] .",
    ".[tab : beam ] beam yields , average rates , and mid - target kinetic energies [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    the gretina @xmath1-ray tracking array  @xcite was installed in the configuration compatible with the liquid hydrogen target described in ref .",
    "projectile - frame @xmath1-ray spectra of @xmath2ca measured in coincidence with incoming and outgoing particle - identification gates corresponding to inverse - kinematics proton scattering are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "intensities of measured @xmath1 rays were extracted by fitting geant4  @xcite simulations to the measured projectile - frame @xmath1-ray spectra as described in ref .",
    "the fits are the smooth curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] . level energies , spins and parities , and @xmath1-ray energies from refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath1-ray energies and relative intensities , branching ratios ( br ) , and cross sections for @xmath2ca from the present work are listed in table  [ tab : gammas ] .",
    "the states of @xmath0ca populated in the present experiment are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] .",
    "the @xmath1-ray intensities , branching ratios , cross sections , and levels in @xmath3ca observed in this reaction were reported previously  @xcite .",
    "next , we examine the @xmath16 assignments for the three radioactive nuclei for which @xmath17 data are reported here for the first time  @xmath2ca .    in @xmath8ca , the ground state ( @xmath18 ) and the first excited state at 2023 kev ( @xmath19 ) have been established as the @xmath20 and @xmath21 single neutron states via the @xmath22 reaction .",
    "the significant @xmath17 cross sections seen here for the 3355 kev ( @xmath23 ) and 3585 kev ( @xmath24 ) states support a picture in which these states arise from the coupling of the @xmath20 neutron to the @xmath4 state in the @xmath25ca core nucleus .",
    "the @xmath23 assignment for the 3355  kev state was made by montanari et al .",
    "@xcite on the basis of @xmath1-ray angular distribution and polarization measurements of the ground state transition with a heavy - ion transfer reaction .",
    "the 3585  kev state is populated weakly ( @xmath26 ) in the @xmath22 reaction  @xcite , but the proton angular distribution in that reaction clearly indicates a @xmath27 transfer .",
    "therefore , the state s wavefunction includes a fragment of the @xmath28 single neutron state , and the state has @xmath24 .",
    "the 3861 kev state also has a significant @xmath17 cross section , so it is likely to be a member of either the @xmath4 core state multiplet or the multiplet arising from the coupling of the @xmath20 odd neutron to the core octupole vibration state .",
    "the data on this state available from @xmath22 are ambiguous , and there is no information available on @xmath1-decays from this state . however , navon et al .",
    "@xcite determined that the isobaric analog resonance in @xmath8sc has @xmath29 , so that the wavefunction of this state must have an admixture of a @xmath20 or @xmath21 single neutron and the state has either @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the next state in @xmath8ca seen in the present experiment is at 4014  kev and has the largest cross section in this isotope .",
    "this state was observed in @xmath22 with @xmath30 , indicating that it has an admixture of the @xmath31 single neutron state and , therefore , @xmath32 .",
    "montanari et al .",
    "@xcite confirmed this using angular distribution and polarization data for the 660  kev @xmath1-ray .",
    "therefore , we deduce that this state is the highest spin member of the multiplet resulting from the coupling of the @xmath20 odd neutron to the @xmath33 state in the @xmath25ca core .",
    "the 4416  kev state , which also has a significant cross section in the present @xmath17 experiment , was observed strongly enough in @xmath22 to determine an @xmath34 transfer  @xcite and therefore @xmath35 or @xmath36 , and the analyzing power data from the same experiment give @xmath37 definitively .",
    "therefore , this state appears to be a member of the octupole multiplet .",
    "the 4757  kev state has a significant @xmath17 cross section , but the @xmath22 study was less conclusive regarding @xmath38 transfer to this state , giving a tentative @xmath34 result .",
    "this state probably has positive parity and @xmath39 or @xmath40 . as in the case of the 4416  kev state , it is attractive to assign this state to the octupole multiplet because of its cross section and likely positive parity . if it is a member of this multiplet , then it has @xmath35 .",
    "the 4885  kev state is weakly populated in @xmath17 . while this state is also weakly populated in @xmath22 , there was enough information to determine @xmath30 and , therefore , a likely @xmath32 assignment .",
    "finally , the 5133  kev state was populated significantly here and has been seen in other reactions , but there is not sufficient information to make even a tentative @xmath16 assignment .",
    "it is likely ( though not rigorously established ) that the ground state of @xmath9ca has @xmath18 since @xmath20 is the lowest valence neutron orbit in @xmath8ca and this orbit is likely filling in the @xmath41ca isotope chain .",
    "the present @xmath17 measurement of @xmath9ca identified three strong states at 3845 , 3941 and 4155  kev .",
    "the strongest states observed in @xmath42ca(p , p ) are octupole vibration states , so it seems quite likely that the three strong states observed here in @xmath9ca are associated with an octupole vibration as well  either the coupling of a @xmath20 neutron hole to the @xmath33 state in @xmath43ca or a @xmath20 neutron to the corresponding state in @xmath44ca .",
    "this multiplet should include states with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "regardless of the specific spin assignments of these three strong states in @xmath9ca , the energy centroid of these three state , 3.95(1 ) mev , is approximately the same as the energies of the octupole states in @xmath42ca .    in a simple weak - coupling model ,",
    "the smallest cross section among these four states would be that for the smallest @xmath47 , in this case the @xmath48 state .",
    "so we can tentatively conclude that the three states observed here are the @xmath36 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 members of the multiplet .",
    "it is certainly possible that each of these multiplet members decays to the ground state via @xmath49 transitions , as the @xmath46 octupole multiplet member in @xmath8ca does .",
    "however , it is generally more likely that these states decay via @xmath50 , @xmath51 or @xmath52 transitions . among",
    "the 3845 , 3941 and 4155  kev states in @xmath9ca , only the 3941  kev state decays directly to the ground state .",
    "therefore , it is most likely that this state is the @xmath36 member of the octupole multiplet , decaying via an @xmath50 transition .    the most likely @xmath16 assignments for the 3845 and 4155 kev states depend on the assignments for the states to which they @xmath1-decay at 2379 and 3462  kev .",
    "both of these latter states are only weakly populated in the present @xmath17 reaction , so it is unlikely that they are members of the octupole multiplet .",
    "furthermore , coupling to the an octupole vibration is the lowest energy way to produce a positive parity state in @xmath9ca , so the 2379 and 3462  kev states are likely to be of negative parity",
    ". both of these states decay directly to the ground state , which we have tentatively assigned to be @xmath18 .",
    "so they may have @xmath19 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , or @xmath55 .",
    "the authors of a report on the @xmath56-decay of @xmath9k  @xcite argue for a @xmath55 assignment for the 3462  kev state on the basis of their results .",
    "the 4155  kev state decays exclusively to the 3462  kev state .",
    "if the 3462  kev state is @xmath23 , then the 4155  kev state is likely @xmath37 , @xmath45 or @xmath46 because @xmath50 is the most likely parity - changing transition .",
    "but if the 4155  kev had @xmath57 , it would likely decay to one of the lower - energy states , which are probably lower - spin positive - parity states , because of the @xmath58 dependence of the @xmath50 transition probability .",
    "so we tentatively assign the 4155  kev state to be @xmath32 .",
    "the 3845  kev member of the octupole multiplet decays to the 2379  kev state , so we tentatively assign @xmath59 for that state .    in @xmath43ca , the cross section for populating the 3990 kev state  which was observed by gade et al .",
    "@xcite via the two - proton knockout reaction from @xmath60ti and tentatively assigned @xmath61  is strong , as is the case for the @xmath62 states in @xmath3ca .",
    "thus , the present @xmath17 result provides additional support for the tentative @xmath62 assignment for the 3990 kev state in @xmath43ca by gade et al .",
    "it is worth noting that a strong 330 kev @xmath1 ray was observed in coincidence with @xmath43ca residues in the present study .",
    "it has not been seen in other reactions , and we are unable to place it in the level scheme .",
    "we can rule out the possibility that this @xmath1 ray feeds the @xmath4 state directly , because the intensity of the 2563  kev @xmath63 transition is significantly below the combined intensities of the 330  kev and 1427  kev @xmath1 rays . while we can not rule out the possibility that the 330  kev @xmath1 ray feeds the state at 3990  kev",
    ", we consider it to be unlikely .",
    "the intensity of this @xmath1 ray indicates that the state it de - excites is highly collective .",
    "proton - scattering cross sections measured in nearby neutron - rich calcium isotopes  @xcite suggest that such a state would have @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "however , in either of these cases , we would expect there to be a strong @xmath1-ray branch to the @xmath4 state , which we do not observe .",
    "it is possible that this 330 kev @xmath1-ray may feed an isomer in @xmath43ca so that we would be unable to connect it to either of the other states in that nucleus observed here .",
    "such a scenario has been observed in @xmath25ca , in which a collective @xmath66 state populated in proton scattering de - excites via a strong @xmath50 transition to the long - lived @xmath67 state .",
    "with the present results on @xmath2ca and the previous results on @xmath3ca , we can examine the systematic behavior of quadrupole and octupole states in these isotopes .",
    "it is remarkable how quickly the @xmath4 state drops from a high energy characteristic of a doubly - magic nucleus in @xmath25ca ( 3832  kev ) down to 1027  kev in @xmath44ca , and then back up to 2563  kev in @xmath43ca .",
    "this behavior reflects the isolation of the @xmath20 neutron orbit between the @xmath68 major shell closure and the strong @xmath69 subshell closure , and the dominance of neutron components in the @xmath4 states of these nuclei .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath33 states in @xmath5ca are close in energy ( 4507 , 3997 , and 4318  kev , respectively ) .",
    "montanari et al .",
    "@xcite argued on the basis of an rpa calculation of the @xmath33 state in @xmath25ca that one proton - one hole excitations dominate the wavefunction of this state .",
    "this would imply that adding neutrons to @xmath25ca would have little impact on the energy of the octupole state and would explain why the @xmath33 states in @xmath5ca are at similar energies .",
    "furthermore , the proton dominance of the octupole states in @xmath5ca would imply that the odd neutron in @xmath8ca or @xmath9ca would be a spectator to the octupole excitation of the core , which is the definition of weak coupling .",
    "the octupole energies shown in figure 3a for the odd - a isotopes @xmath7ca are the centroids of the octupole states reported here for these nuclei .",
    "these centroids fit well into the systematic behavior of the @xmath70 states in the even - a isotopes , as they should in a weak - coupling picture .    of course",
    ", proton dominance of the octupole excitations in the even-@xmath71 isotopes and weak coupling in the odd-@xmath71 isotopes should also be evident in the @xmath17 excitation strengths . fig .",
    "[ fig : e3_delta3]b shows that the @xmath17 cross sections to the @xmath33 states in @xmath5ca are identical , to within experimental uncertainties .",
    "the cross sections to the octupole multiplet members in @xmath7ca have much smaller cross sections , but that is to be expected , because in the weak - coupling model the strength of the octupole vibration of the core nucleus is distributed among the multiplet members in the odd-@xmath71 nucleus .",
    "however , the sum of the cross sections of the individual octupole states in @xmath8ca , @xmath72 mb , is equal to that of the @xmath70 state in its weak - coupling core nucleus , @xmath25ca . the same is true in @xmath9ca : the sum of the octupole state cross sections , @xmath73 mb , is equal to the @xmath70 state cross section in its weak - coupling core nucleus , @xmath43ca .",
    "the deformation lengths extracted for the octupole states in @xmath0ca using the coupled - channels code ecis95  @xcite and the global optical potential of ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e3_delta3]c .",
    "ecis does not allow for the input of non - integer spins , so to analyze the cross sections in the odd - a isotopes , the experimental cross sections were first multiplied by the factor @xmath74 , which is taken from the weak coupling result in  @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath75 is the angular momentum of the phonon ( in this case 3 ) , @xmath76 is the angular momentum of the single nucleon being coupled to the phonon ( here @xmath77 ) , and @xmath78 is the angular momentum of the multiplet member in the odd-@xmath71 nucleus .",
    "then , ecis is used to find the deformation length @xmath79 that fits each multiplet member . the deformation length for each multiplet member",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e3_delta3]c .",
    "even the deformation lengths for the odd - a multiplet members are remarkably constant near 1  fm , validating the weak - coupling interpretation for these multiplets .",
    "to conclude , the @xmath17 reaction in inverse kinematics has been used to measure @xmath0ca .",
    "the energies and strengths of the octupole states in these isotopes are remarkably constant with changing neutron number , providing strong evidence that these octupole states are dominated by proton excitations .",
    "this is even true for the odd - neutron @xmath7ca isotopes , in which the weak coupling of the odd neutron to the core even - even nuclei appears to describe the observed behavior well .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the @xmath4 states , for which the energies vary strongly with neutron number .",
