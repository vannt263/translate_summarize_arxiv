    "dark matter accounts for circa 85% of the matter in the universe , but besides from its cosmological abundance , very little is known about its nature . in a wide class of models ,",
    "the relic abundance is generated via a thermal freeze - out in the early universe .",
    "typically @xmath2 annihilation processes into e.g.  standard model particles keep dark matter in thermal equilibrium with the standard model bath until the annihilation processes drop below the hubble expansion rate .",
    "after this point in time the abundance of dark matter is essentially constant throughout the universe .",
    "this constitutes the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) paradigm .    in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the authors revived an alternative mechanism @xcite for achieving the observed dark matter relic density . instead of using @xmath2 annihilation processes",
    "they assume that a dominant @xmath0 number - changing process occurs in the dark sector involving strongly interacting massive particles ( simps ) .",
    "this process reduces the number of dark particles at the cost of heating up the sector . however , the presence of hot dark matter is problematic for structure formation , which means that at the time of freeze - out , the dark matter particles must to be in thermal equilibrium with the standard model ones .",
    "this , in turn , requires small couplings between the dark and the standard model sectors . in this way the energy from the dark sector can be transferred to the standard model via scattering processes .",
    "the coupling between the two sectors allows for direct and indirect detection , while the large self - interactions can play a role in structure formation , by solving the _",
    "core vs.  cusp _",
    "problem @xcite . compared to the wimp paradigm , where the dark matter particles typically are believed to be around the tev scale , this model can yield dark matter particles with masses around a few 100 mevs .",
    "this is an interesting alternative to the wimp paradigm given the fact that current experiments are putting substantial constraints on this old paradigm .",
    "these constraints can , however , be alleviated or even be completely offset within the recently proposed _",
    "safe dark matter _ paradigm @xcite .    a follow - up paper @xcite introduced a realization of the simp mechanism based on an underlying strongly coupled sector described via chiral perturbation theory . in this",
    "set - up the pions constitute the dark matter particles and a key role is played by the time - honoured wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xcite .",
    "the wzw term is non - vanishing in theories where the coset space of the symmetry breaking pattern has a non - trivial fifth homotopy group .",
    "this topological term introduces a 5-point pion interaction , making it an ideal candidate for the @xmath0 annihilation process . in qcd ,",
    "for example , the term describes the annihilation of two kaons into three pions . in this paper",
    "we shall only be concerned with the symmetry breaking pattern @xmath3 for @xmath4 .",
    "the simplest realization of this breaking pattern comes from an underlying @xmath5 gauge group , but in general it can be realized for any @xmath6 gauge group . the actual pattern of chiral symmetry breaking depends on the number of flavours , colors and matter representation .",
    "a comprehensive study of the conformal window for @xmath6 gauge groups can be found in @xcite .",
    "lattice simulations have further demonstrated that such an underlying dynamics truly leads to the expected pattern of chiral symmetry @xcite with the spectrum of the composite spin - one resonances first computed in @xcite .",
    "the computations performed in @xcite make use of the first non - vanishing order in the chiral expansion for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 processes . for the @xmath9 annihilation process",
    "it is one order higher than the related @xmath2 self - interaction process .",
    "we will demonstrate that it is important to analyse the physical results via a consistent next - to - leading ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) chiral perturbative treatment .",
    "we will , in fact , show that the leading order analysis is phenomenologically unreliable because it is outside the range of convergence .",
    "the important higher order corrections substantially increase the range of convergence of the theory , and therefore the phenomenological reach . within our controllable analysis",
    "we discover that higher order corrections increase the tension with respect to the phenomenological constraints making it hard for the simplest realisation to be phenomenologically viable .",
    "chiral perturbation theory is an expansion in powers of the pion mass and momentum . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the standard terminology lo , nlo and nnlo when referring to @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , beyond leading order it is well known that a consistent chiral perturbation analysis requires the introduction of a number of low - energy constants that uniquely identify the underlying strongly coupled theory .",
    "the nlo low - energy constants , relevant for the @xmath2 process , are denoted here by n - lecs . at nnlo",
    "both processes contain low - energy constants which we denote by nn - lecs .",
    "since the @xmath0 process emerges naturally at the four - derivative level , it does not have a leading order contribution . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath2 process does have leading order contributions , introducing a potential mismatch in power counting between the two processes . in our set - up the solution to the boltzmann equation ( which depends on the thermally averaged cross section for the @xmath0 process )",
    "returns a value for the pion decay constant , as a function of the pion mass , such that the expected relic density is obtained .",
    "these values are subsequently substituted into the cross section for the @xmath2 self - interaction , which is constrained by observations of e.g.  the bullet cluster @xcite .",
    "technically , the mismatch arises because the two processes , unless computed to the same order , disagree on the definition of the physical pion mass @xmath13 and decay constant @xmath14 which at nlo can be written as : @xmath15 \\\\",
    "f_\\pi & = f\\left[1 + \\frac{m^2}{f^2}(a_fl+b_f ) + { \\mathcal{o}}\\left(\\frac{m^4}{f^4}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the bare parameters from the leading order lagrangian , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are combinations of n - lecs and @xmath20 is a log term defined in equation . the amplitude should , however , be expressed in terms of the physical quantities by rewriting the bare quantities in terms of the physical ones . from this argumentation",
    "it is clear that a consistent calculation requires both processes to be calculated at the same order .    in practice",
    "it means that one has to go beyond leading order when computing the @xmath8 process , and this is what we will do here .",
    "the additional benefit of extending the computation of the @xmath2 processes to nlo is that we will also be able to estimate , and extend , the convergence of the perturbative expansion towards the physically relevant regime . to check the stability of the perturbative expansion we also estimate the nnlo corrections . because we are interested only in a preliminary estimate of the nnlo corrections we retain the direct contributions from the loop diagrams and neglect the finite contributions stemming from the nn - lecs .",
    "we will show that the nnlo results are already much closer to the nlo , than the nlo are to the lo for a much wider range of pion masses .",
    "the boltzmann equation for the @xmath0 process reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pion number density and @xmath23 is the hubble constant . as argued in @xcite contributions from the @xmath2 annihilation into standard model particles can be neglected , because they are sub - dominant . to solve the differential equation we rewrite it in terms of the dimensionless quantities @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the entropy and @xmath27 the temperature . for the entropy and matter density we used the definitions @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the effective degrees of freedom contributing to the entropy and density , respectively . in this notation ,",
    "the differential equation becomes @xmath31 where @xmath32 combines information from both @xmath33 and @xmath34 into a single function for the effective degrees of freedom ( the function is different from the function used in the @xmath2 case ) .",
    "the equilibrium function @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the modified bessel function of the second kind and @xmath38 is the number of pions .",
    "the thermally averaged scattering cross section used in @xcite reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the number of colors and our definition of the pion decay constant @xmath14 differs by a factor of one - half compared to the original paper .",
    "the value of @xmath14 is chosen in such a way that the solution to the boltzmann equation gives the expected relic density .",
    "an estimate of the higher order corrections to the thermally - averaged cross section can be found in the appendix .          to determine the pion - pion scattering amplitude we make use of the non - linearly realized chiral lagrangian .",
    "we adopt the notation of @xcite together with the results from the nnlo .",
    "in fact , we have independently performed the nlo computations for the breaking pattern @xmath41 and shown that the earlier published results @xcite must be amended . to keep the work self - contained we briefly outline the computational setup .",
    "let @xmath42 be the global flavor symmetry of the vector - like fermions transforming according to a given representation of the underlying gauge dynamics , and let @xmath23 be the stability group after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the associated goldstone boson manifold @xmath43 is parametrized by @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the broken generators , normalized as @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes trace in flavor space .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 transforms as @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath52 is a space - time independent element of @xmath42 while @xmath53 is a space - time dependent element of @xmath23 that must satisfy the constraint equation .",
    "the chiral lagrangian quantities that transform homogeneously under the stability group @xmath23 are @xmath54 in the first expression @xmath55 and @xmath56 are external currents that can be set to zero in the computation of the pion - pion scattering amplitude . in the second expression",
    "@xmath57 is a spurion field that formally ensures chiral symmetry invariance at every step in the computation . only at the very end",
    "it is replaced by its expectation value @xmath58 which explicitly breaks chiral symmetry .",
    "the pion mass is then written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is related to the underlying chiral condensate and @xmath61 is the new quark mass . in this notation",
    "the lo lagrangian is @xmath62 and the relevant part of the nlo lagrangian is @xmath63 because the nlo lagrangian represents the most general lagrangian it is possible to absorb the one - loop divergences by an appropriate renormalization of the low energy constants .",
    "we use the modified @xmath64 scheme where @xmath65 with @xmath66        here @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "it should be noted that the renormalized coefficients @xmath69 will depend on the energy scale @xmath70 introduced by dimensional regularization .",
    "to simplify the results later on we use the following short - hand notation for the log terms arising from the loop diagrams .",
    "@xmath71 at nlo there are three new diagrams contributing to the amplitude for pion - pion scattering ( see @xcite for details and diagrams ) and at nnlo there are twelve additional diagrams . the scattering amplitude can be written as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a group theoretical factor that depends on the breaking pattern and the number of flavors .",
    "for the case @xmath74 all relevant quantities can be found in the appendix .",
    "the topological term can be written in a compact local form as a five - dimensional integral @xcite known as the wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) term @xmath75 were @xmath76 is the fifth spacetime coordinate .",
    "we furthermore redefine the two quantities @xmath77 with @xmath78 being a five - dimensional derivative .",
    "ordinary minkowski space is now defined as the surface of the five - dimensional space where @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore the pre - factor of the wzw term contains direct information about the underlying gauge dynamics . the gauged version of this term and its generalization to include left and right vector sources can be found in @xcite .",
    "at nlo there is only one diagram for the @xmath0 process while at the nnlo there are three more diagrams .",
    "however , only two of these diagrams are non - zero in the approximation of vanishing nn - lecs .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the physical results both at the nlo and nnlo .    at the nlo we retain the n - lecs that uniquely specify the underlying strongly coupled theory .",
    "these constants are expected to be a number of order unity suppressed by a factor @xmath80 , defined in equation . to determine the lecs one can either use experiments , when available ( as for qcd ) , or perform lattice simulations when the underlying theory is known @xcite .",
    "for qcd the n - lecs are known @xcite and most of them are of the order @xmath81 .",
    "interestingly this is an order of magnitude smaller than navely expected .",
    "therefore to estimate the n - lecs we randomize their values using a gaussian distribution with spread @xmath82 and zero mean . by averaging over a large number of samples we arrive at a nlo band that reflects the size of the contributions from the n - lecs .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nlo ] we plot the solution to the boltzmann equation ( dashed orange line ) and the cross section for the @xmath2 self - interactions ( solid lines ) at lo ( blue line ) and nlo ( orange line ) .",
    "the band on the orange line is the estimated effect from the low - energy constants .",
    "the horizontal dashed line is the upper perturbative limit @xmath83 .",
    "the cross section for the self - interactions is constrained from above by the solid grey line .",
    "the contraint from the bullet cluster @xcite is @xmath84 @xmath85/g but simulations of halo structures @xcite suggest that the limit might be closer to @xmath86 @xmath85/g .",
    "this uncertainty is reflected in the grey band .",
    "the model is phenomenologically relevant when the dashed orange line is below the perturbative limit and the self - interactions are below the solid grey line .",
    "however , for @xmath87 these two criteria are never met simultaneously when the nlo corrections are properly taken into account .",
    "the results demonstrate that the nlo corrections are crucial to establish the phenomenological viability of the model .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : nlo ] shows that by substantially increasing the number of colors one may still hope to meet the phenomenological criteria although in this case a more careful use of the large-@xmath40 expansion is needed .",
    "because we assume small couplings to the standard model , there is also a lower limit on the dark matter mass of around 10 mev .",
    "in fact , lighter masses will change the effective number of neutrino species @xcite which is in tension with the planck data @xcite .    since , for the region of phenomenological interest , the nlo corrections are quite sizeable ( especially for small values of @xmath40 ) we also estimate the nnlo corrections . to consistently include these higher order corrections ,",
    "we re - determined the solution to the boltzmann equation using the thermally averaged cross section @xmath88 at nnlo .",
    "the term @xmath89 comes from the loop corrections whereas the last term @xmath90 would contain the nn - lecs if we had included them .",
    "as it turns out , the solution is relatively insensitive to the value of @xmath90 assuming it is of order @xmath91 .",
    "this means that setting the low - energy constants to zero in the amplitude for the @xmath0 process is a reasonable approximation . for the self - interactions we estimate the effects from just the n - lecs in the same way as before .    in figure",
    "[ fig : nnlo ] we show the solution to the boltzmann equation ( dashed red line ) and the @xmath2 scattering cross section ( solid red line ) at nnlo .",
    "there are two important points to make , namely that ( a ) the solution @xmath92 decreases , making the investigation more amenable to a perturbative analysis , while ( b ) the cross section seems to increase further , strengthening the tension with the self - interaction constraints .",
    "if the solution did not decrease one would have seen a more dramatic increase in the nnlo cross section .",
    "this underlines the importance of a consistent calculation . despite the small difference between the nlo and nnlo cross sections , we observe a more prominent effect from the lecs as indicated by the purple band",
    "there are two reasons for the increased uncertainty .",
    "it is partly due to the fact that the n - lecs enter more frequently in the nnlo result , but also because the squared norm of the nlo amplitude enters in the nnlo cross section .",
    "because this quantity is strictly positive , the average of a gaussian distribution deviates from zero .    in figure",
    "[ fig : flag ] we provide regions of validity where the different orders in perturbation theory can be trusted up to around 20% .",
    "the dots show where each order breaks down because the corrections from the next order are of equal magnitude .",
    "for the nnlo case the values are rough estimates from extrapolating via the previous orders . in the grey region",
    "the theoretical uncertainty of the nnlo expansion is more than 20% .",
    "we therefore estimate that for @xmath87 perturbation theory at nnlo is reasonable up to around 30 mev .",
    "however , besides the aforementioned constraint coming from the effective number of neutrino species for masses below 10 mev , this region is excluded by the constraint on the self - interactions . even by allowing the nnlo treatment to be used beyond this point , the model can not easily meet the phenomenological constraints .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the claimed phenomenologically relevant region @xcite is far beyond lo perturbation theory .    for the case of @xmath93",
    "one has control up to around 110 mev at nnlo , but here the theory is still in tension with the constraints on self - interactions .",
    "however , after this point the theory meets the constraints for plausible combinations of low - energy constants .    one can introduce additional breaking of the flavour symmetry which , in principle , can reduce the @xmath2 scattering amplitude @xcite , but it will not change the range of convergence for the different perturbative orders .",
    "by consistently using chiral perturbation theory we studied the phenomenological viability of an interesting class of composite dark matter models . in these models the relic density of the dark pions is achieved via @xmath0 number - changing processes making use of the wzw term .",
    "we determined both the @xmath0 and the @xmath2 processes to the nlo and nnlo order in the chiral expansion and showed that higher order corrections substantially affect the lo result of @xcite for the @xmath8 processes . at the nlo and nnlo",
    "we have shown that the simplest models @xcite , with a moderate number of underlying colors , are at odds with phenomenological constraints . however , for sufficiently many colors , or via additional breaking of the flavor symmetry , it is still possible to find small regions in the parameter space consistent with phenomenological constraints .",
    "our results are also of immediate interest for different realizations of composite dark matter @xcite and/or composite ( goldstone ) higgs @xcite featuring the same pattern of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "furthermore first principle lattice simulations of the underlying dynamics @xcite are able to provide crucial information on the low - energy constants @xcite .",
    "the cp@xmath1-origins centre is partially funded by the danish national research foundation , grant number dnrf90 .",
    "mh is funded by a lundbeck foundation fellowship .",
    "the cross section used for the plots has been evaluated at the scattering threshold where @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in this limit",
    "the cross section reads @xmath96 with @xmath27 the amplitude of the process .",
    "the group theoretical factor in the scattering amplitude for the @xmath97 pattern of chiral symmetry breaking is @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "the functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 evaluated on the kinematical threshold read : + _ lo _  all terms should be multiplied by @xmath102 .",
