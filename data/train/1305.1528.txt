    "let us assume that , by using the least squares approach ( 1.21)-(1.22 ) , we have obtained the estimate @xmath1 of the beamlike vector @xmath2 actually matched to the measurements system , and let our estimate be itself a beamlike vector .",
    "then the estimates @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the beam parameters can be calculated as follows :    @xmath5    using the error vector ( 1.26 ) , the equation for @xmath6 can be rewritten in the form    @xmath7    and for the mismatch between @xmath8 and @xmath9 one obtains    @xmath10    averaging of both sides of the formulas ( [ sss01 ] ) and ( [ sss02 ] ) with respect to the measurement statistics gives us    @xmath11    @xmath12    these formulas are quite remarkable .",
    "they are exact , they involve only first ( which are equal to zero in our case ) and second statistical moments of the error vector @xmath13 , and they do not depend on the matched twiss vector @xmath8 . besides that , one sees the appearance of the invariant of the covariance matrix @xmath14 in the right hand side of the equation ( [ sss03 ] ) . due to ( 1.34 ) this invariant is negative if the matrix @xmath15 is diagonal .",
    "it means that if errors in the beam size measurements are uncorrelated , then the  typical reconstructed emittance \" @xmath3 is an underestimation of the real emittance @xmath16 , that was already observed a number of times by different authors in their monte - carlo simulations .    to go further , behind the exact relations ( [ sss03 ] ) and ( [ sss04 ] ) , we do need to make some approximation .",
    "let us assume that the measurement errors are not too large and let us denote    @xmath17    with these notations we obtain from ( [ sss01 ] ) and ( [ sss02 ] ) that    @xmath18    @xmath19    squaring both sides of these formulas and then expanding the right hand sides of the obtained equalities with respect to the variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we obtain    @xmath22    @xmath23    where the omitted terms are of the orders three and higher in the components of the error vector @xmath13 .",
    "we take the functions    @xmath24    as the basic components for the construction of the vector - valued optimality criterion .",
    "both these functions can be written as quadratic forms with respect to the vector @xmath13 :    @xmath25    @xmath26    using this representation , one finds that each of these quadratic forms is positive semidefinite , but is not positive definite .",
    "moreover , it is possible to show that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are incomparable ( there are points where @xmath27 is equal to zero , but @xmath28 is not , and vice versa ) , i.e. , really , properties of both these functions have to be reflected in the optimality criterion . )",
    ", one may conclude that the optimization of @xmath27 alone could be sufficient .",
    "in general , it is not true .",
    "the function @xmath28 , if not controlled , may become very large and can spoil the optimization result through the high order terms which are not shown in ( [ estemit22 ] ) . ] the values of the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not depend on the positioning of the reconstruction point , and as the components of the optimality criterion we take the averages    @xmath29    where the function @xmath30 is defined in ( 1.35 ) .    if the errors in the beam size determination at different measurement states are uncorrelated , then one can write    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the betatron function matched to the measurement system and @xmath37 is the corresponding phase advance .",
    "the other useful forms of @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be obtained if we will use the notations    @xmath40    with these notations :    @xmath41    @xmath42    where @xmath43 can now be expressed as follows    @xmath44 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45 . \\label{sec217}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    let us introduce vector @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the vector of the measurement errors .",
    "the vector @xmath48 has covariance matrix equal to the identity matrix , that allows us to say that its components are ",
    "better balanced in the order of magnitude \" than the components of the original vector of the measurement errors . using the vector @xmath48 , the expression for the functions @xmath49 ( @xmath50 )",
    "can be written in the form    @xmath51 v_{\\varsigma}^{-1/2 } \\big)\\ , \\tilde{\\varsigma } , \\label{quadform03}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the matrices @xmath52 and @xmath53 are defined in the equations ( 1.37 ) and ( 1.38 ) , respectively .",
    "one can calculate , that    @xmath54 v_{\\varsigma}^{-1/2 } \\big ) = { \\varepsilon_0 ^ 2 } \\ , \\langle   \\psi_m   \\rangle , \\label{quadform04}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and , therefore , one can obtain the estimates    @xmath55    the upper estimates of this type are usually called worst - case estimates , and we see that the minimization of the statistical averages of the functions @xmath49 improve also their upper worst - case estimates . ) , while the traces can easily be calculated . ]",
    "so we have introduced the optimality criterion , which is independent from the position of the reconstruction point .",
    "unfortunately , this criterion includes two objective functions . to reduce a number of objectives to a single one we suggest to use the additive convolution and take the average of the weighted sum    @xmath56    as the single valued optimality criterion :    @xmath57    note that , for arbitrary positive @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the function @xmath60 is a positive definite quadratic form with respect to the error vector @xmath13 .",
    "it is also a leading term of the expansion of the function    @xmath61    with respect to the components of the same vector @xmath13 .",
    "thus , as an output of monte - carlo simulations , one may use the average @xmath62 and compare it with the analytical predictions given by the function @xmath63 .",
    "the choice of the weights @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( as usual in the area of the multicriteria analysis ) should reflect the specific of the problem under study , but , as concerning general situation , we do not see currently any clear theoretical reasons to take them unequal .",
    "the twiss parameters matched to the measurement system enter the optimality criterion in two different ways , directly through the function @xmath30 and indirectly , when the measurement errors depend on the measured beam sizes ( i.e when the matrix @xmath15 depend on the vector @xmath64 ) .",
    "if the matrix @xmath15 depend on the vector @xmath64 , then there is not much that one can say besides the trivial statement that the optimal twiss parameters are the twiss parameter which , for the fixed transport matrices between measurement states , minimize the optimality criterion .",
    "so , let us assume that the measurement errors are independent from the measured beam sizes .",
    "in this situation one can prove that    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is defined in ( 1.36 ) .",
    "from this it follows that , if the twiss parameters are optimal , then    @xmath67    let us assume additionally that the matrix @xmath15 is diagonal",
    ". then the second equality in ( [ invqf03 ] ) takes on the form    @xmath68    i.e. the optimal twiss parameters minimize the weighted sum of squares of the betatron function .",
    "because both minimums in ( [ invqf03 ] ) are achieved in the same point , the optimal twiss parameters ( and only they ) satisfy    @xmath69    using the formulas ( [ sec219 ] ) and ( [ sec217 ] ) , the equality ( [ sec2_31 ] ) can be transformed into the following equivalent form    @xmath70    the left hand side of ( [ sec2_32 ] ) is a positive definite quadratic form in the variables @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and therefore it can be equal to zero if and only if    @xmath73    which is the characteristic property of the optimal twiss parameters .     and @xmath74 , respectively , as functions of the cell phase advance .",
    "the measurement errors are relative and are equal to @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( from lower to upper pairs of curves).,width=245 ]",
    "in this section we consider the question of optimal phase advance choice for the procedure of emittance measurement in periodic beam transport channels .",
    "we assume that we have a measurement system with @xmath78 measurement states @xmath79 and with the property that the matrices propagating particle coordinates from the state @xmath80 to the state @xmath81 are all equal to each other and allow periodic beam transport with the periodic betatron function @xmath82 and with the corresponding phase advance @xmath83 being not a multiple of @xmath84 .",
    "we assume also that this periodic betatron function is the betatron function matched to the measurement system and that the errors in the beam size determination at different measurement states are uncorrelated and have the same rms magnitude @xmath85 ( i.e. @xmath86 ) .                    for an arbitrary @xmath93",
    "the function @xmath94 is @xmath95-periodic and can be extended by continuity for all @xmath83 inside a period , and becomes unbounded as one approaches @xmath96 and @xmath95 .",
    "it is never smaller than one and is equal to one ( reaches its minimum ) only in the points          looking at the formulas ( [ pms01 ] ) and ( [ pms03 ] ) one sees that the choice of @xmath83 in accordance with the rule ( [ pms06 ] ) brings the second multipliers in the right hand sides of these formulas to the minimal possible values .",
    "but , in general , it does not guarantee that the products of the two multipliers in ( [ pms01 ] ) and ( [ pms03 ] ) are also minimized .",
    "so the answer to the question , if a @xmath78-cell measurement system reaches an optimal performance when its cell phase advance is a multiple of @xmath95 divided by @xmath78 , depends on the behavior of the ratio @xmath101 during the scan of the phase advance . if this ratio stays unchanged , then it is certainly true .",
    "it includes , for example , the case when @xmath85 is proportional to @xmath102 , i.e. when errors in the beam size determination are relative to the beam size itself .",
    "but if the ratio @xmath101 changes , then the optimality of the phase advances ( [ pms06 ] ) is not guaranteed .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider a transport channel constructed from four identical thin lens fodo cells of the unit length and let us assume that four measurement stations are placed in the middle of drift spaces separating the defocusing and focusing lenses .",
    "for this particular system we made a series of monte - carlo simulations using as an output the square root of the average of the functions ( [ qfintr01 ] ) with @xmath103 , and then compared them with the analytical predictions given by the square root of the function ( [ quadform07 ] ) .",
    "these simulations and comparisons were made for two cases : measurement errors are relative to the beam size and measurement errors are beam size independent .",
    "the results are presented in fig.1 and fig.2 , respectively .",
    "one sees , that while for the relative errors the optimal values of @xmath83 are @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( as expected ) , the effect of the absolute errors gives a single optimal point @xmath106 .     and",
    "@xmath74 , respectively , as functions of the cell phase advance .",
    "the measurement errors are beam size independent and are normalized to coincide with the relative errors of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath107 ( from lower to upper pairs of curves).,width=245 ]      v.balandin , w.decking and n.golubeva , _ invariant criterion for the design of multiple beam profile emittance and twiss parameters measurement sections _ , proceedings of ipac13 , shanghai , china , 12 - 17 may 2013 , tupwo011 ."
