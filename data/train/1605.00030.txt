    "the rapid theoretical and experimental advancement in nanomaterials during the last two decades has enabled to engineer multifunctional devices for the control of light with unprecedented proficiency .",
    "for instance , some schemes which are mostly based on transformation optics allow the isolation of a region from interaction with an external light that , in addition , remains unperturbed far from the shadowed space @xcite .",
    "consequently , an outside observer can not detect any target placed inside the cloak by means of an electromagnetic wave field",
    ". however , such cloaking devices are commonly subject to stringent conditions like the need of materials with exotic electromagnetic parameters reducing their applicability to specific frequencies .",
    "alternatively we may turn a nanoparticle to be _",
    "invisible _ by integrating some nanostructured element like ultrathin coatings and metasurfaces in such a way that scattering of the arrangement is much reduced in comparison with the bare object @xcite . in this case ,",
    "light indeed interacts with the nanocomposite , but scattering from different elements interferes destructively to almost cancel the total scattered signal .    the origin of such scattering drop ,",
    "thus reducing dramatically the overall visibility of the scatterer , may be attributed to different aspects of the light - matter interaction .",
    "for instance , the local polarizability of distinct components of a moderately sized object with opposite signs may be canceled out in a proper designed configuration @xcite .",
    "the polarization vector in the elementary materials is anti - parallel with respect to each other , implying that a dipole moment of opposite phase is induced .",
    "another approach for the cancellation of scattering from an engineered scatterer is based on the properties of the characteristic lineshape of the fano resonance , where the emission of electromagnetic waves by the object create the interference between the nonresonant scattering from the particle and scattering by narrow mie modes @xcite .",
    "this effect has also been observed in high - index nanoparticles without additional coating layers @xcite .",
    "of particular interest follows the inclusion of epsilon - near - zero shells in the spectral range of interest , which may lead to a significant drop of the scattering spectrum and , in addition , create a shielding effect in the bounded space @xcite . for scatterers with cylindrical symmetry ( along the @xmath0 axis ) and",
    "composed of dielectric and plasmonic materials , the effect of opposite polarizabilities is mostly observed in tm@xmath1-polarized wave fields , whereas fano resonances may be simply utilized in te@xmath1 polarization configurations .",
    "recently , a multilayered metallodielectric nanotube with radially - periodic structure has been proposed , which presents a tunable spectral band with significant reduction of its scattering efficiency @xcite .",
    "such scattering cancellation is produced simultaneously for both polarizations and occurs when one of the components of the permittivity tensor characterizing the effective anisotropy of the metamaterial approaches zero , that is near the boundary of the hyperbolic regime @xcite . particularly for te@xmath1-polarized fields ,",
    "a large birefringence of the nanoshell enables a self - guiding effect along the radial direction that is applied to validate the observed scattering reduction .    in this work",
    "we extend the previous idea of employing radially - periodic metal - dielectric nanotubes to optimize the scattering cancellation of the nanocavity .",
    "for that purpose , we introduce a new degree of freedom that concerns the marginal layers set by the side of the core and the environment medium , the latter playing a critical role primarily in the presence of metamaterial nonlocalities @xcite .",
    "we also present a critical discussion on the predominant causes leading to such invisibility effect .",
    "the estimation of our results is performed using the full - wave lorenz - mie method @xcite , and a matrix formulation is developed in order to further simplify the evaluation of the scattering efficiency , which presents some similarities to the transfer matrix formalism previously implemented in stratified plane metamaterials @xcite .",
