    "hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) , a wide - bandgap insulator , has recently emerged as a sort of `` magic '' substrate for exfoliated graphene sheets .",
    "early on , it was demonstrated  @xcite that hbn is a much better substrate than @xmath2the ordinary substrate  @xcite for much of the early work in graphene physics and devices  because its surface is much flatter and because it presents a much smaller number of charged impurities .",
    "exfoliated graphene sheets deposited on hbn ( g / hbn ) or graphene sheets that are encapsulated in hbn ( hbn / g / hbn ) have therefore much larger mobilities  @xcite than those that are deposited on @xmath2 .",
    "subsequently , vertical stacks  @xcite comprising graphene and hbn have been used for proof - of - concept devices such as field - effect tunneling transistors  @xcite and fundamental studies of electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "more recent experimental work  @xcite has demonstrated that hbn substantially alters the electronic spectrum of the massless dirac fermion ( mdf )  @xcite carriers hosted in a nearby graphene sheet .",
    "indeed , when graphene is deposited on hbn , it displays a moir pattern  @xcite , a modified tunneling density of states  @xcite , and self - similar transport characteristics in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "this spectral reconstruction of the mdf energy - momentum dispersion relation is , however , only relevant in the case of long - wavelength moir superlattices ( superlattice period @xmath3 ) , which occur when the twist angle between the graphene and hbn crystals is small .",
    "short - wavelength superlattices yield changes of the mdf spectrum at dopings that are not achievable by electrostatic gating .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the authors of ref .   have demonstrated that hbn / g / hbn samples , in which the role of contact resistance is minimized by using a suitable geometry , can display very large mobilities , which are solely limited by scattering of electrons against graphene s acoustic phonons . according to boltzmann - transport theory  @xcite , this scattering mechanism yields  @xcite a mobility @xmath4 that decreases like @xmath5 with increasing carrier density @xmath6in good agreement with experimental data  @xcite and , therefore , a drude dc transport scattering time @xmath7 that decreases like @xmath8 in the same limit .",
    "we remind the reader that , in the same theoretical framework and by virtue of screening , scattering against charged impurities yields a mobility that increases with increasing carrier density  @xcite .",
    "high - quality vertical heterostructures comprising graphene and hbn crystals may have a large impact on the success of graphene plasmonics  @xcite , an emerging field of research that has recently attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "the goal of graphene plasmonics is to exploit the interaction of infrared light with  dirac plasmons \" ( dps)the self - sustained density oscillations of the mdf liquid in a doped graphene sheet  @xcite  for a variety of applications such as infrared  @xcite and terahertz  @xcite photodetectors , strong light - matter interactions  @xcite , enhanced light absorption  @xcite and bio - sensing  @xcite .",
    "interest in graphene plasmonics considerably increased after two experimental groups  @xcite showed that the dp wavelength is much smaller than the illumination wavelength , allowing an extreme concentration of electromagnetic energy , and that it is easily gate tunable .",
    "these early experiments , based on scattering - type near - field optical spectroscopy ( s - snom ) , were not optimized to minimize dp losses and therefore maximize the plasmon inverse damping ratio .",
    "microscopic calculations targeting the role of electron - electron interaction effects  @xcite beyond the random phase approximation ( rpa ) and charged impurity scattering  @xcite indicate that losses can be strongly reduced by using hbn rather than @xmath2 as a substrate .",
    "indeed hbn has both a larger static dielectric constant , thus suppressing the strength of electron - electron interactions , and a much lower impurity concentration than @xmath9 .",
    "the impact of electron - phonon scattering on the lifetime of hpp modes was recently addressed in ref .",
    ", where the authors showed that the inverse damping ratio of mid - infrared hpp modes is strongly limited by scattering against optical phonons of both the sio@xmath10 substrate and the graphene sheet .",
    "the hpp mode damping rate was estimated by introducing a self - energy correction in the _ local _ conductivity @xmath11 , which took into account electron - impurity , electron - phonon , and edge scattering .",
    "the contribution of electron - phonon interactions to the hpp lifetime was assumed to be independent of momentum .",
    "the dependence of the damping rate on momentum stemmed from the contribution due to the scattering against the edges of the sample .    in this article",
    "we present a theoretical study of the performance of hbn / g / hbn stacks for applications in the field of graphene plasmonics .",
    "more precisely , we present a microscopic theory of the damping rate of hpp modes in a graphene sheet encapsulated between two hbn semi - infinite slabs .",
    "we focus on scattering of hpp modes in a graphene sheet against i ) graphene s acoustic phonons and ii ) hbn optical phonons , two sources of scattering that are expected to play a key role in limiting the lifetime of collective density oscillations in hbn / g / hbn stacks .",
    "besides achieving good quantitative agreement with recent experimental work  @xcite , we confirm the important fact that the plasmon lifetime is not necessarily correlated with the mobility  @xcite ( i.e.  with the transport lifetime that controls the uniform dc conductivity ) .",
    "more accurately , the plasmon lifetime is controlled by the non - local conductivity @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the wavevector and @xmath14 is the plasmon frequency . in the present case , retaining both the wavevector- and frequency - dependence of the non - local conductivity , we are able to show that the plasmon lifetime is in fact _ anti - correlated _ with the transport mobility .",
    "indeed , while the mobility decreases with increasing carrier density  @xcite , the plasmon lifetime shows exactly the opposite behavior .",

    "<S> graphene sheets encapsulated between hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) slabs display superb electronic properties due to very limited scattering from extrinsic disorder sources such as coulomb impurities and corrugations . </S>",
    "<S> such samples are therefore expected to be ideal platforms for highly - tunable low - loss plasmonics in a wide spectral range . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we present a theory of collective electron density oscillations in a graphene sheet encapsulated between two hbn semi - infinite slabs ( hbn / g / hbn ) . </S>",
    "<S> graphene plasmons hybridize with hbn optical phonons forming hybrid plasmon - phonon ( hpp ) modes . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on scattering of these modes against graphene s acoustic phonons and hbn optical phonons , two sources of scattering that are expected to play a key role in hbn / g / hbn stacks . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at room temperature the scattering against graphene s acoustic phonons is the dominant limiting factor for hbn / g / hbn stacks , yielding theoretical inverse damping ratios of hybrid plasmon - phonon modes of the order of @xmath0-@xmath1 , with a weak dependence on carrier density and a strong dependence on illumination frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that the plasmon lifetime is not directly correlated with the mobility : in fact , it can be anti - correlated . </S>"
