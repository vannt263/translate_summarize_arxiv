    "the understanding of the hierarchy of quark masses is a fundamental open problem of high energy physics . in the investigation of this question",
    ", the theory of particle condensation in field theory had been a basic framework @xcite . in an effort to explore this issue , an alternative to the standard pqcd , including the presence of quark and gluon condensates in the free vacuum state generating the wick expansion , has been considered in refs .",
    "the exploration was in great extent motivated by the consideration about that massless qcd convey the strongest forces in nature , as well as the free theory is a massless highly degenerate one for both quarks and gluons .",
    "this fact rises question about what could be the real intensity of the dimensional transmutation effect @xcite .",
    "the first step was to search for simple states of the free theory in which large numbers of zero momentum quark and gluon states were created in the standard free vacuum state , on which , then , adiabatically connect the interaction @xcite . in the start ,",
    "the objective was to determine a modification of the standard feynman rules of qcd embodying new condensate effects , with the expectation of to attain a theoretical prediction of superconductivity kind of properties of the particle mass spectrum underlined in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , some indications about the possible dynamic generation of quark and gluon condensates were obtained . in particular in ref .",
    "@xcite  it was  restricted the study to consider only the existence of quark condensates , with the aim of exploring the generation of large values for them .",
    "the motivation was the suspicion about that this mechanism might be able in generating a variant of the @xmath0 quark model , as an effective action for massless qcd .  in this case",
    ", the generating functional @xmath1 of the system introduced in ref.@xcite was transformed to an alternative representation in which all the effects of the condensates were incorporated in a new vertex showing two quark and two gluon legs .",
    "this representation implemented the dimensional transmutation effect produced by the modification done in the free vacuum state .",
    "the results suggested a technical path that could evidence a possible strong instability of massless qcd under the generation of fermion condensates .",
    "this outcome could furnish an explanation of the particle mass hierarchy in a kind of generalized  nambu - jona lasinio dynamical symmetry mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , a drawback of the diagram expansion introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the new vertex , although being covariant was a nonlocal one .",
    "that is , it was not associated to the four appearing fields defined at the same space - time point .",
    "moreover , the evaluated two loop corrections to the vacuum energy turned out to be unbounded from below as a function of the quark condensate parameter , a fact that shifted the answer of the question about the prediction of dynamical mass generation to higher loop evaluations .",
    "the undesirable properties of the new vertex ,  can be traced back to the form of initial state of the free theory employed to connect the gauge interaction .",
    "this wavefunction was a sort squeezed state constructed with nearly zero momentum quark creations operators acting on the standard free vacuum .",
    "it has a structure similar to the bcs state in the usual superconductivity theory .",
    "the vertex was derived from a particular representation in which the feynman gauge was explicitly employed and the quark free particle states used in the construction were particular zero momentum states in this special gauge .",
    "therefore , the gauge invariance of the description was directly broken by the derivation .",
    "henceforth , it came to the mind the possibility that the connection of the interaction on a specially defined in a more sophisticated way vacuum state could implement the locality and gauge invariance of the functional integral action in the ending theory .",
    "in particular coordinate dependent states in this same gauge exist that can be imagined to allow the mentioned construction .    in this work",
    "we start form a the results for the generating functional  for the massless qcd in which quark and gluon condensate parameters were introduced in the free vacuum , for afterwards construct the wick expansion in ref .",
    "the resulting scheme included integrals over auxiliary boson and fermion parameters which appeared in the process of linearly representing the quadratic forms in the sources introduced by the inclusion of the gluon and quark condensates .",
    "then , it is firstly observed that the simple promotion of the gluon and quark condensate parameters to be space dependent functions  makes the action defining the generating functional a local and gauge invariant one .",
    "further , arguments are presented suggesting that the connection of the interaction in some sort of more general and yet undetermined initial modified vacuum state , could show the functional to be equivalent to massless qcd , after the adiabatic connection of the interaction .",
    "afterwards , the discussion in the work is restricted to the case of  retaining only the fermion condensate auxiliary functions .",
    "the study of the case of the gluon condensate functions has also appreciable interest in itself for to explore its possibilities in the description of confinement and low energy physics .",
    "however , the issue of the quark mass generation possibility is closer to the fermion condensate parameters and we decided to consider it first here .  in this case , the gaussian dependence of the quark auxiliary functions can be integrated out to give a theory action given by the massless qcd one plus six terms ( one for each quark flavour ) .",
    "they implement the above mentioned local and gauge completions of the non local and gauge non invariant action obtained in ref .",
    "the strongest support we had found for the physical relevance of these new terms simply comes form their structure ; it seems that they are allowed counterterms of the massless qcd lagrangian . in other words ,",
    "if not obstructed by a subtle point not noticed by us , it seems that such a contributions can appears in the effective action of massless qcd after finite renormalizations of the four legs 1pi vertex determining the two gluon and two fermion fields terms in this expansion .",
    "curiously , the new terms does not obstacle power counting renormalizability .",
    "this apparently strange property can be understood by taking into account that the new lagrangian term also includes a contribution to the quark free propagators , which acquire a more converging behaviour @xmath2 at large momenta .",
    "thus , the theory remains being power counting renormalizable .",
    "the above mentioned properties furnish an intrinsic interest to the theory resulting after simply adding the new local and renormalizable terms to the massless qcd action , as an alternative to the standard qcd .",
    "further , the feynman diagrams associated to the new vertices and quark propagators are defined . as before noticed masses for the free fermions are defined by the new coupling constants associated to each of them .",
    "one curious outcome is that the larger the coupling ( to be called from now on `` flavour condensate '' couplings ) associated to the action terms for each flavour , the smaller the quark mass becomes .",
    "that is , the top quark shows the smaller condensate coupling .",
    "the modified feynman rules determined by the new vertices are defined .",
    "the gluon free propagator remains unaltered , but the fermion ones decompose in two terms showing the same massive pole .",
    "one of them resembles a scalar particle propagator and the other shows a dirac propagator structure but including the same massive pole in addition to the usual zero mass one .",
    "we postpone the study of the renormalization ( the behaviour of the running strong and flavour condensate couplings ) and start here to explore the first implications of the analysis by evaluating the gluon self - energy in the @xmath3 order in the gauge coupling and all order in the flavour condensate ones . the result for",
    "the gluon polarization operator became transversal as implied by the gauge invariance for this second order in the coupling calculation when all orders of the flavour couplings are included .",
    "further , the transversal part of the polarization operator is employed to evaluate the vacuum potential ( taking all the mean field values equal to zero ) as a function of the flavour condensate couplings .",
    "the potential in this case , at variance with the one evaluated in @xcite resulted to be bounded from below .",
    "moreover , for small coupling values , in the here considered approximation , it shows a dynamical symmetry breaking generating non vanishing values for the quark masses .",
    "since the renormalization group properties of the theory are delayed to a next study , it is not possible to make here clear cut phenomenological predictions .",
    "however , as a first exploration , the results for the potential were employed to select the @xmath4 coupling and the dimensional regularization scale parameter @xmath5 in order to fix the mass for the top quark nearly to 173 @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the flavour condensate couplings are suggested as playing a role similar to a higgs field in the approach . in this calculation",
    "the values of the coupling @xmath3 and the scale parameter @xmath5 result to be far from satisfying the known connection between the qcd running coupling and @xmath5 .",
    "however , it can be taken into account that in the considered two loop calculation , all the six quark contributions are `` uncoupled '' . that is , all propagator entering a diagram have the same flavour .",
    "therefore , the hierarchy of quark masses , if really implied by the theory , as we currently suspect , is to be expected only after including higher loop terms in the potential . in this case",
    "mixing among different quark species has the chance of determining a realistic dynamical symmetry breaking effect .",
    "this view about the need of including higher loop corrections coincides with the one exposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was remarked that this requirement becomes a natural one in a situation in which bound state effects are needed in determining a breaking of the flavour symmetry . in our considered case , to predict the quark mass hierarchy , it should occurs that a minimal effective potential appears for a large value of a single flavour quark condensate , while the other ones become very much smaller in size , and this minimum lays below another possible one in which various quarks condensate couplings get equal values .",
    "this situation only could have the chance of happening for the considered expansion , when the potential includes terms in which different sorts of quark propagators are present .",
    "therefore , it is possible to conclude that the low values of the coupling got in the evaluation of the potential done here , is not yet reflecting a drawback for the analysis to be valid in describing the mass hierarchy .",
    "according to the above remarks , the next important steps in the search seems to be the study of the renormalization group properties of the expansion and the evaluation of three loops corrections to the potential for determining whether or not a quark mass hierarchy follows .",
    "the presentation proceeds as follows .  in section ii the proposal of the local and renormalizable gauge theory including gluon and quark condensates and possibly being equivalent to massless qcd",
    "is presented .",
    "the case of retaining only the quark condensate is there shown to  reduce to a modified local and renormalizable massless qcd action .",
    "section iii is devoted to evaluate the gluon polarization operator in second order @xmath3 of the strong coupling and all orders in the flavour coupling parameters defining the new vertices , and to check its transversality .",
    "finally , section iv making use of the transversal part of the polarization operator , presents the evaluation of the effective potential in the two loop approximation and all orders in the new interaction parameters . in the summary",
    "the results are reviewed and possible extensions of the work commented .",

    "these changes of the initial condition in the process of connecting the interaction , after using the rules for constructing the wick expansion ( @xcite ) ,  led to modified free propagators in ( [ propagators ] ) .",
    "some quantities had been evaluated with these modified expansion ( @xcite ) and its general gauge invariance was argued @xcite .",
    "it was possible to check that if the gluon condensate parameter defined here is chosen to match the estimated value of the more usual gluon condensation parameter @xmath21 then the masses of the light quarks are predicted to be the constituent quark mass of nearly @xmath22 mev . in addition , sample loop calculations of the vacuum energy as a function of the condensate parameters were done in refs .",

    "they gave indications of a dynamical generation of the quark and gluon condensates .",
    "for gluons the one loop result gave a form of the potential similar to the potential in the early chromomagnetic savvidi models of confinement .",
    "however , the working expression ( [ wick ] ) of the generating functional shows two limitations , one of theoretical nature and another technical one .",
    "the technical one is associated with the fact that in the new contributions existed singularities requiring of  a special regularization process to be well defined @xcite .",
    "the theoretical one can be described as follows . in ref .",

    "@xcite we restricted the discussion to the case in which only the quark condensate parameter were retained , seeking to transform the modified feynman expansion in a more helpful form by integrating over the auxiliary parameters .",
    "it was possible to transform the generating functional by mapping the effect of the condensate , from incorporating a delta function term in the free propagator , to the addition of a new term in the massless qcd action associated to a vertex , showing two gluon and two quark legs .",
    "however , the form of this vertex , although being lorentz and global color invariant was not local in space - time , since it had the form of a double integral over the product of two pairs of fields evaluated at two different space - time points .",

    "since , here we evaluated all the terms in the expansion which are of order two in the strong coupling being and exact ( to all orders )  in the flavour condensate parameters , the transversality should be satisfied .",
    "further , after also adding all the  transversal contributions and simplifying the result ,  the total unrenormalized one loop gluon self - energy can be written in the form @xmath136    employing the  minimal substraction renormalization scheme ( ms ) ,  the one loop divergences can be eliminated by deleting the terms showing poles in the expansion of the above expression in a laurent series in the parameter @xmath137 however , the resulting expression is cumbersome and since we will not analyze it here , is not written . after adding to @xmath138 the free part of the gluon equation of motion , the  following expressions for the gluon one loop propagator and its inverse follow@xmath139",
    "let us consider below the main steps in the evaluation of the one and two loops corrections to the effective action which will give the negative of the vacuum energy as a function of the quark masses  @xmath112 in that approximation .",
    "the one loop term reduces to the logarithm of the determinant of the new form of the inverse quark propagator , which is the result of the functional integral defining free quark generating functional .",
    "the calculation of this term , following usual steps in this special case , is  sketched below @xmath140\\nonumber\\\\ &   = -v^{d}\\sum_{p}\\frac{dp^{d}}{(2\\pi)^{d}i}\\log\\det[\\frac{m_{f}}{m_{f}^{2}-p^{2}}i]-\\frac{v^{d}}{2}\\sum_{p}\\frac{dp^{d}}{(2\\pi)^{d}i}\\log\\det [ \\frac{p^{2}-m_{f}^{2}}{p^{2}}i]\\nonumber\\\\ &   = v^{d}\\sum_{p}\\frac{dp^{d}}{(2\\pi)^{d}i}2n\\text { } \\log[m_{f}^{2}-p^{2}]+v^{d}\\sum_{p}\\frac{dp^{d}}{(2\\pi)^{d}i}2n\\text { } \\log[\\frac{p^{2}}{m^{2}}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    after taking the derivative the expression over @xmath141 , it follows@xmath142 which when integrated over @xmath141 in the interval @xmath143 by assuming @xmath144 being in a region in which its real part is negative , leads to @xmath145 the finite part of the above expression in the laurent series expansion can be evaluated by employing the expression of @xmath146 in terms of the four - dimensional volume and the dimensional regularization scale parameter @xmath5@xmath147    then , the finite part the one loop effective action in the ms scheme becomes @xmath148 the result after changed its sign , gives the dependence on @xmath112 of the vacuum energy in this approximation .",
    "the potential decreases at large mass values indicating the dynamical generation of the mass in this approximation .",
    "this outcome for the first correction was also obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite ,      the two loop vacuum energy can be readily evaluated starting from the already known transversal part .",
    "this follows , thanks to the formula @xmath149 which follows after noting that the diagrams defining the two loop approximation for the effective action can be organized as the sum of the diagrams defining the self - energy contracted with the gluon free propagator .    after substituting in the above formula the evaluated expression for @xmath150 it follows @xmath151    in the above formula , the first and the second terms vanish in dimensional regularization .",
    "the third one can be expressed    as follows @xmath152    each of the two integrals appearing in the first term is equal to the  @xmath153 in ( [ lm])@xmath154  the second term is proportional to a two loop scalar master integral given in ref . @xcite .",
    "then , the unrenormalized two loops effective action has the form @xmath155    substituting  the formulae for the coupling @xmath4 and the @xmath98 dimensional volume @xmath146according to @xmath156 it follows@xmath157 afterwards , expanding the formula ( [ efaction ] ) in laurent series around @xmath158 , deleting the pole terms and tending to the limit @xmath159 leads to the finite value of the two loop contribution to the effective action in the ms scheme @xmath160    the total effective potential is then given by the expression @xmath161    in figure [ fig3 ] the potential divided by the fourth power of the renormalization parameter @xmath5 is plotted as a function of the mass divided by @xmath5 for various small values of the coupling constant @xmath162 .",
    "for higher values the coupling minimum of the minimum of the potential tends to disappear .",
    "however , as it was remarked before , the two loop approximation is insufficient to define whether or not the scheme predicts a hierarchical flavour dynamic symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , the evaluation done should not be expected to be relevant for answering the main physical question : the possibility of large quark mass generation at the values of the strong coupling .",
    "however ,  the results shown in figure [ fig3 ] indicate that at small values of the  gauge coupling , the interaction is able to generate large masses for the fermions .",
    "the figure corresponds to fix as an example @xmath163 @xmath60gev , then it follows that for a  small coupling near the value @xmath164 the fermion mass gets a value near the top quark mass @xmath165  gev .",
    "this  evaluation suggests the interesting possibility that , if the theory is in fact equivalent to the massless one , the  generation of large mass mechanism could also work for the low coupling electroweak scale .     as function of the ratio @xmath166 . at @xmath163",
    "gev various small values of the coupling constant around @xmath164 were chosen to evidence that the minimum of the potential can be fixed at a @xmath112  being close to the top quark mass of @xmath167 gev . for higher values of",
    "the coupling the minimum tends to disappear .",
    "however , as described in the text , the lack of the possibility for generating a hierarchy of mass in the considered two loops approximation , determines the need for improving the evaluation of the potential , in order to decide whether or not a large and hierarchical mass generation effect can be predicted at the large values of the strong coupling observed in nature . ,",
    "we have proposed an improved version of the modified version of qcd discussed in previous works , which shows local gauge invariance and include the same kind of gluon and fermion condensate parameters .",
    "the analysis done for constructing the proposal suggests its equivalence with massless qcd , after considered with a special renormalization procedure designed to implement the dimensional transmutation effect . in respect to the gluon condensation properties",
    ", the theory should reproduce the previous derivation of the constituent mass for the light quarks  given in @xcite and the savvidy kind of potential as a function of the gluon condensate parameter .",
    "the study of the possible improvement in the predictions determined by the gained gauge invariance and locality of the description will be considered elsewhere . for the case of only retaining the fermion condensate parameter ,",
    "the fermion auxiliary functions were integrated leading to a theory described by a new lagrangian given by the massless qcd one but including a new gauge invariant term for each quark flavour .",
    "the new lagrangian terms can be considered as local modifications of the ones derived in ref . @xcite . in the same form",
    ", they have a similar component constituted by the product of two gluon and two quark fields , but now evaluated in the same space - time point .",
    "the new terms also show components leading to three legs vertices which were absent in the previous form of the generating functional .",
    "the terms determines masses for all the six quarks which are given by the reciprocal of the new flavour condensate couplings linked with each quark type .",
    "therefore , the strength of the condensate couplings decreases with the masses of the associated quarks .",
    "the gluon self - energy was evaluated up to the second order in the gauge coupling including all orders of the flavour condensate ones .",
    "the result , being associated to a well defined order in the couplings , satisfies the transversality condition as required by the gauge invariance .",
    "in addition , it is also gauge parameter independent .",
    "the transversal part of the self energy is employed to evaluate the two loop contribution to the effective action at zero mean fields ( minus the vacuum energy ) as a function of the flavour condensate couplings .",
    "the transversality and gauge parameter independence of the gluon self - energy , then also determined the gauge parameter independence of the evaluated potential .",
    "afterwards , in order to interpret the result , we assumed that the introduced flavour couplings represent dynamically generated quantities , as it was effectively the case in the precedent works for the similar non gauge invariant couplings which motivated their consideration in this study .",
    "then , in this first approximation , the potential is able to predict the dynamic generation of quark masses , for sufficiently small values of the qcd coupling .",
    "it can be remarked that the generation happening only for small couplings at the considered approximation , does not mean a negative answer to the question about whether or not the scheme can address the quark mass hierarchy .",
    "this is can be understood by noting that in the two loop order , the diagrams can not yet incorporate lines associated to two different kinds of flavours . for this appearance to happens , at least three loops corrections are required .",
    "it is reasonable that in order to explain the quark mass hierarchy as a dynamic flavour symmetry breaking , there should exist `` interference '' like effects in the vacuum energy corrections . in them ,",
    "the contributions of diagrams showing two or more kinds of fermion lines might tend to rise the energy of the configurations with equal values of the quark condensates , making them more energetic that the ones in which one of the quark condensate parameters gets a large value and the others hierarchical lower ones . at the moment we have the impression that the considered framework is ideal to realize the democratic symmetry breaking properties of the mass hierarchy remarked in refs .",
    "the predictions of the general discussion including gluon condensates for the low energy processes , as well as the renormalization properties and the evaluation of three loop contributions in the case of only having the fermion condensate , are expected to be considered elsewhere .",
