    "ceei ( competitive equilibrium with equal incomes ) is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in resource allocation  @xcite .",
    "the concept is based on the idea of a market based equilibrium : each agent has cardinal utilities over objects and each agent is considered to have equal budget of unit one to spend .",
    "based on the utilities of the agents , an assignment of objects is in ceei , if for some price vector , the supply meets demand and the agents use their budget to maximize utility .",
    "ceei is an attractive solution concept because it implies envy - freeness .",
    "in aamas 2014 , bouveret and lematre  @xcite highlighted a scale of fairness criteria . among the criteria",
    ", they positioned ceei  @xcite as the most stringent which implies the other fairness criteria .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that finding a discrete a - ceei assignment is ppad - complete and it is np - hard to distinguish between an instance where an exact ceei assignment exists , and one in which there is no a - ceei tighter than guaranteed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite posed the following open problem : what is the computational complexity of checking whether these exists a discrete ceei assignment ?",
    "we settle this problem by showing it is strongly np - hard .",
    "in addition to the ceei notion previously studied  @xcite which we will from now on refer to as ceei - disc , we highlight a notion called ceei - frac that is stronger than ceei - disc .",
    "the desirable aspect of ceei - frac is that it implies the ceei - disc and unlike ceei - disc , it implies pareto optimality . whereas the complexity of checking whether an assignment is ceei - disc has been open , we show that ceei - frac can be verified in polynomial time .",
    "we also show that computing a ceei - frac discrete assignment is strongly np - hard in general but polynomial - time if the utilities are zero or one . independently from our work  @xcite , @xcite recently presented complementing complexity and characterization results for ceei - disc and showed that checking whether a given assignment is ceei - disc is conp - complete .",
    "hence , there is a marked contrast between the complexity of testing ceei - disc and ceei - frac .",
    "an assignment problem is a triple @xmath0 such that @xmath1 is the set of agents , @xmath2 is the set of objects , and @xmath3 is the utility profile which specifies for each agent @xmath4 utility function @xmath5 where @xmath5 denotes the utility of agent @xmath6 for object @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that for each @xmath8 , @xmath9 for some @xmath4 and for each @xmath4 , @xmath9 for some @xmath10 .    a fractional assignment @xmath11 is a @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 $ ] such that @xmath14 $ ] for all @xmath4 , and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 for all @xmath15 .",
    "the value @xmath17 represents the fraction of object @xmath7 being allocated to agent @xmath6 .",
    "each row @xmath18 represents the _ allocation _ of agent @xmath6 .",
    "the set of columns correspond to the objects @xmath19 .",
    "a feasible fractional assignment is _ discrete _ if @xmath20 for all @xmath4 and @xmath15 .",
    "let the set of all fractional allocations be @xmath21 and the set of all discrete allocations be @xmath22 .",
    "each agent has additive utility so that the utility received by agent @xmath6 from assignment @xmath11 is @xmath23 the nash welfare of an assignment @xmath11 is @xmath24 .",
    "an assignment @xmath11 satisfies ceei - disc if there exists a price vector @xmath25 that specifies the price @xmath26 of each object @xmath7 such that the maximal share that each @xmath4 can get with budget @xmath27 is @xmath28 .",
    "note that the assignment @xmath11 itself could be fractional .",
    "when we only consider discrete assignments , ceei - disc coincides with the ceei notion for discrete allocations studied in @xcite .",
    "an assignment @xmath11 satisfies ceei - frac if there exists a price vector @xmath25 that specifies the price @xmath26 of object @xmath7 such that the maximal share that each @xmath4 can get with budget @xmath27 is @xmath29 .",
    "ceei - frac coincides with the market equilibrium notion studied in @xcite .",
    "we settle the complexity of ceei - disc and answer the open problem in @xcite",
    ".              then both complete discrete assignments in which agent @xmath27 gets @xmath30 and agent @xmath31 gets @xmath32 are envy - free and pareto optimal .",
    "however the assignment in which @xmath27 gets only @xmath30 and @xmath31 gets the other objects is not a ceei - frac assignment .",
    "compute in polynomial time the utilities achieved by the agents in a ceei - frac fractional solution @xmath11 via the eisenberg - gale convex program .",
    "the discrete assignment @xmath33 is a ceei - frac assignment iff the utilities achieved by the agents in @xmath33 are the same as in @xmath11 .      checking whether exists a discrete assignment is ceei - frac is equivalent to checking whether there exists one which achieves the maximum nash welfare that can be achieved by a fractional assignment .",
    "the problem is strongly np - hard via the same reduction as in proof of theorem  [ th : ceei - disc ] .",
    "the argument above also shows that for a restricted domain , if nash welfare maximization is in p for discrete assignments , then checking whether there exists a ceei - frac discrete assignment is also in p.      in order to check whether a discrete ceei - frac assignment exists or not , we can compute a nash welfare maximizing discrete assignment and check whether the nash welfare achieved is equal to the objective acheived in the gale - eisenberg program .",
