    "<S> , relative be@xmath0 number corresponds to the doppler cooling fluorescence count rate as measured on an ultraviolet - sensitive photomultiplier tube . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a maximum be@xmath0 lifetime of 11.4(6 ) h by minimizing the parallel doppler cooling photon flux to a 3 % duty cycle and @xmath67 saturation parameter , thereby producing beh@xmath0 impurities with a predicted time constant @xmath68200 h. the significantly shorter 11.4(6 ) h measured lifetime appears to be due to be@xmath0 collisions with background gas molecules that produce heavier impurity ions in the absence of any doppler cooling light . </S>",

    "<S> after increasing the doppler cooling parameters to @xmath72 at 100 % duty cycle , the be@xmath0 trap lifetime drops to 2.19(2 ) h ( @xmath65 )  consistent with a background h@xmath3 pressure of @xmath5 @xmath73 pa ( @xmath5 @xmath74 torr ) as beh@xmath0 production dominates all other be@xmath0 conversion rates . </S>",
    "<S> the unit duty cycle for doppler cooling is representative of typical trapped - ion quantum information work where the time for cooling and preparing initial qubit states is a significant fraction of the experimental sequence  @xcite . to demonstrate pd </S>",

    "<S> the total time for each pulse burst is 0.4 s , and the doppler cooling is switched off for this duration as well as 2 s after the photodissociation sequence , yielding a negligibly - modified strong cooling duty cycle of @xmath598 % . </S>",
    "<S> the pd pulses yield an increased time constant for decay of 9.6(7 ) h , which is roughly consistent with the ` weak cooling ' result . </S>",
    "<S> the small difference between the 11.4 h and 9.6 h time constants is likely the result of daily fluctuations in background gas pressure . </S>",
    "<S> a high rate ( i.e. every 2 min . ) of pd pulses is necessary to maintain a pure be@xmath0 crystal since we observe that beh@xmath0 converts to beo@xmath0 and beoh@xmath0 at a rate three times faster than be@xmath0(@xmath22p ) + h@xmath75 beh@xmath76 h conversion under ` strong cooling ' conditions .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated the first photodissociation results exploiting the @xmath47 electronic transition in beh@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this technique removes an important limitation for large - scale quantum information experiments that rely on be@xmath0 and does so with a commercially - available , turnkey laser system . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve a more than four - fold increase in experimental run - time with a 2 % reduction of the duty cycle . </S>",
    "<S> improved beam alignment would enable an experimental determination of the absolute pd cross section at 157 nm as well as optimization of the dissociation beam profile . </S>",

    "<S> [ behlevels](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed pd rate is lower presumably due to partial excimer beam obstruction along the 1.3-m in - vacuum path . </S>",
