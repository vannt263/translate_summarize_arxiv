    "the existence of various non - trivial junction conditions for a point interaction in one - dimensional quantum systems is an intriguing aspect in quantum mechanics .",
    "the property of the junction conditions was fully revealed by the mathematical works @xcite and has also been pointed out by a number of research @xcite on one - dimensional quantum systems with potential barriers made of the dirac delta function and its ( higher ) derivatives ( see @xcite for a new approach based on the integral form ) . the point interaction in one - dimensional quantum systems has a relatively large parameter space , in comparison with those in higher dimensions .",
    "it has been known that the parameter space in one dimension is characterized by @xmath0 , while those in two dimensions and three dimensions are characterized by @xmath1 .",
    "several authors @xcite reported that the interesting characteristics of supersymmetry , geometric phase , anholonomy , duality , and so on appear owing to the large parameter space for the junction conditions in one dimension .",
    "these previous works placed a special emphasis relatively on bound states in one - dimensional systems .",
    "thus , we now consider the scattering of a quantum particle by point interactions in one dimension .",
    "the essential properties of the scattering by a single point interaction were discussed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that the quantum transmission through arbitrarily located @xmath2 point interactions that have scale invariance exhibits random quantum dynamics . in this paper , focusing on quantum resonance , we investigate the occurrence of resonant transmission through two independent , successive point interactions .    as for the resonant tunneling , it is remarkable that a property inherent in quantum mechanics plays a crucial role in this phenomena . since the leading work in @xcite , the basic features had been investigated theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "these studies have motivated various subsequent works ; realistic effects on the resonant tunneling were discussed in @xcite , and some different theoretical methods which can deal with an arbitrary finite periodic potential were developed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the resonant tunneling is still an active area of research for the applications to high - frequency oscillators in recent years @xcite . by virtue of recent technology , i.e. , nanotechnology ,",
    "the microfabrication down to the atomic scale becomes possible , and one - dimensional conductors also become accessible .",
    "however , the effects of the above - mentioned non - trivial junction conditions in one dimensional quantum systems on resonant transmission have not been fully discussed in the literature .    the parameter space for two independent , successive point interactions in one - dimensional quantum systems is given by @xmath3 .",
    "thus two point interactions are characterized by eight parameters . in this paper , we particularly pay our attention to the important subclass for junction conditions which has parity invariance and includes typical junction conditions , like that for a free particle with no interaction , that for a delta function potential , and that for a epsilon function potential .",
    "when we consider this subclass , the parameter space of each point interaction is given by a torus @xmath4 , and thus the parameter space of two independent , successive point interactions is reduced to @xmath5 , which is described by four parameters . nevertheless , even in this reduced parameter space , whether resonant transmission occurs or not is quite non - trivial .",
    "thus , we investigate the conditions for the parameter space under which the resonant transmission occur in one - dimensional quantum systems with two successive parity - invariant point interactions    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we review the junction conditions for a point interaction in one - dimensional quantum systems and discuss the scattering of plane wave by a parity - invariant point interaction . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we deal with quantum transmission through two different , successive point interactions , and investigate the conditions for the parameter space under which perfect resonant transmission occur . finally , we give concluding remarks in sec .",
    "we consider quantum mechanics in one spatial dimension ( say , @xmath6-axis ) with a point interaction located at the origin ( @xmath7 ) ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the wave function @xmath8 is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the imaginary unit , the plank constant and the mass of a particle , respectively .",
    "the probability current is expressed as @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the junction condition at the point interaction is provided by the conservation of the probability current ) . ]",

    "when we introduce new vectors as in @xcite , @xmath21 eq .  ( [ eq : jc0 ] ) can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the transpose of the complex conjugate .",
    "equation ( [ eq : phi - c ] ) is equivalently expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an arbitrary nonvanishing constant with the dimension of length .",
    "thus , @xmath26 is connected to @xmath27 via a unitary transformation .",
    "note that the condition ( [ eq : phi - c2 ] ) was derived also from the method of a self - adjoint extension of the hamiltonian in @xcite , although the notation is slightly different from ours . therefore , we obtain the junction condition @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath30 identity matrix , and @xmath31 is a @xmath30 unitary matrix , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "it is sometimes useful to adopt the following parametrization for @xmath31 , @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the pauli matrices , and @xmath35 are parameters .",
    "for example , when we take @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , we retrieve a free particle with no interaction , in which @xmath39 , @xmath40 . when we take @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath38 , where @xmath43 is a parameter , we can derive a potential made of the dirac delta function @xmath44 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the parity - invariant junction conditions .",
    "we now introduce the parity transformation @xmath45 , which acts on the wave function as @xmath46 since @xmath47 , the eigenvalues of @xmath45 take @xmath48 .",
    "we assume the eigenstates to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the eigenvalues @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , i.e. , @xmath53 the eigenstates @xmath54 are found to be @xmath55 the parity transformations of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given , respectively , by @xmath58 we define the projection operators @xmath59 onto the states @xmath60 as @xmath61 so that we have @xmath62 these projection operators satisfy the relations @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 the parity transformation of the junction condition ( [ eq : jc ] ) becomes @xmath66 where @xmath67 is multiplied from the left - hand side .",
    "thus the unitary matrix @xmath31 is transformed under the parity transformation as @xmath68 therefore , the parity invariance imposes the condition , where the superscript @xmath69 denotes the transpose .",
    "thus , their boundary condition corresponds to that for pt ( parity and time - reversal ) invariance ( see also @xcite ) . ]",
