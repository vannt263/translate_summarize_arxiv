    "measurement of the spectrum of magnetic excitation is crucial for understanding magnetic properties of magnetic materials .",
    "neutron scattering has been widely used to measure the spectrum . however , the source of neutron is not easy to access",
    ". it also requires large samples .",
    "for example , the neutron scattering is not applicable to ultra - thin films because the interaction between the spin wave and neutrons is week@xcite . on the other hand , conventional techniques such as the ferromagnetic resonance and brillouin light scattering can only measure the energy gap of spin wave .",
    "abrikosov vortices being magnetic excitation in superconductors are expect to interact strongly with the magnetic moments , which points a possible way to measure the magnetic excitation using vortex dynamics .",
    "it was proposed that one can use vortex dynamics driven by a dc current to measure the spin - wave excitation through transport measurement of the _ iv _ characteristics @xcite .",
    "one may be able to obtain the spectrum of spin wave up to the wave number @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the coherence length .",
    "the proposed technique can be applied to superconductors with coexistence of magnetic and superconducting order@xcite .",
    "one can also measure the spectrum of magnetic excitation in conventional magnetic materials by fabricating artificial bilayer systems , consisting of the magnetic material to be measured and a superconducting layer@xcite .    in this work",
    ", we propose to measure the spectrum of magnetic excitation in magnetic materials using motion of vortex lattice driven by both ac and dc current through transport measurement .",
    "the advantages with ac current are : 1 ) it does not require large current to reach the resonances between the vortex motion and spin - wave excitations , thus the nonequilibrium effect that leads to the instability of vortex lattice and heating effect can be minimized ; 2 ) the effect of random pinning centers can be minimized with an ac current ; 3 ) additional information such as wave vector of the vortex lattice can also be obtained .",
    "we consider a magnetic superconductor where magnetic ordering coexists with superconductivity as shown in fig . [ f1](a ) or a bilayer system with magnetic film and superconducting film as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) .",
    "we assume that the magnetic system has an in - plane easy axis ( @xmath3 axis ) .",
    "the spectrum of spin wave @xmath4 is gapped due to the anisotropy , where @xmath5 is the wave vector .",
    "a magnetic field to create vortex lattice is applied perpendicular to the easy axis of the magnetic moments ( @xmath6-axis ) . a transverse current both with",
    "dc , @xmath7 , and ac component , @xmath8 , then is applied to drive the vortex lattice .",
    "driven by the lorentz force , vortex lattice moves with a dc velocity @xmath9 , and also oscillates due to the ac current and the interaction with the magnetic moments , @xmath10 .",
    "the motion of vortex lattice perturbs the magnetic moments and excites magnons .",

    "the motion of vortex is described by an over - damped langevin equation @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the vortex coordinate and @xmath13 is the bardeen - stephen damping constant with @xmath14 the upper critical field and @xmath15 the normal state conductivity just above the critical temperature .",

    "the random pinning centers distort lattice order in static@xcite .",
    "however in the flux flow region , the vortex lattice order is recovered because the motion of lattice quickly averages out the effect of random pinning centers@xcite . in this region , it is safe to approximate straight vortex line along the @xmath6-axis and the problem becomes two dimensional .    in the following calculations , we will focus on the resonance between motion of vortex lattice and magnetic subsystem , and neglect the resonance due to pinning centers .",
    "we use an approximation that the motion of vortex lattice is not affected by the magnetic moments .",
    "the motion of vortex lattice in the presence of the dc and ac current thus is described by @xmath23 where @xmath24 forms a regular lattice with a wave vector @xmath25 and @xmath26 is an arbitrary phase .",
    "the vortex lattice oscillates with frequency @xmath27 and amplitude @xmath28 due to the ac input current @xmath29 .",
    "we use the quasistatic approximation that the structure of vortex driven by the lorentz force remains the same as the static one .",

    "typically the energy gap is @xmath137 to @xmath138 .",

    "we estimate @xmath143 for a system with linear size @xmath144 for @xmath91 .",

    "the ac current helps vortices to depin from the pinning centers , similar to thermal noise .",
    "@xcite . for pb - in and nb - ta alloys @xcite",
    ", it was found experimentally that the pinning effect becomes very weak for an ac current with frequency above @xmath148 .",
    "thus the pinning effect can be greatly suppressed with the ac current with frequencies @xmath149 used in our proposal .    when the motion of vortex lattice experiences a quenched pinning center , it can be effectively modelled as a particle moving in a periodic potential .",
    "when an ac current is applied in additional to the dc current , there will be current steps known as the shapiro steps in the _ iv _ curve@xcite .",
    "the shapiro steps occur when the frequency of the ac current matches the washboard potential for vortex due to the pinning center , @xmath150 .",
    "the shapiro steps thus can be easily distinguished from the resonance with the spin - wave excitations , see eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) .",
    "the current in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) does not depend on the phase difference between the ac current and spin wave @xmath26 , thus precludes the existence of the shapiro steps due to the magnetic moments .",
    "the reasons for the absence of the shapiro steps are as follows .",
    "first , the lattice constant of spin subsystem is much smaller than @xmath33 , thus the vortex lattice does not feel the washboard potential due to the magnetic moments . secondly , the response of magnetic moments to the magnetic field associated with the vortex lattice is linear , thus no dc current is induced in this linear region .    in summary , we have proposed to measure the spectrum of magnetic excitation in magnetic materials using motion of vortex lattice driven by both ac and dc current in superconductors . the resonance between the motion of vortex lattice and spin wave manifests as an enhancement of current at a given voltage .",
    "thus the frequency of the magnetic excitation with the wave number determined by vortex lattice constant can be extracted from transport measurement . by changing the lattice constant through applied magnetic fields ,",
    "the spectrum of the magnetic excitation up to a wave vector of order @xmath0 can be obtained .",
