    "<S> in this paper , we consider a cognitive radio ( cr ) network in which a secondary multiantenna base station ( bs ) attempts to communicate with multiple secondary users ( sus ) using the radio frequency spectrum that is originally allocated to multiple primary users ( pus ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we employ partially - projected regularized zero - forcing ( pp - rzf ) precoding to control the amount of interference at the pus and to minimize inter - sus interference . </S>",
    "<S> the pp - rzf precoding partially projects the channels of the sus into the null space of the channels from the secondary bs to the pus . </S>",
    "<S> the regularization parameter and the projection control parameter are used to balance the transmissions to the pus and the sus . however , the search for the optimal parameters , which can maximize the ergodic sum - rate of the cr network , is a demanding process because it involves monte - carlo averaging . </S>",
    "<S> then , we derive a deterministic expression for the ergodic sum - rate achieved by the pp - rzf precoding using recent advancements in large dimensional random matrix theory . </S>",
    "<S> the deterministic equivalent enables us to efficiently determine the two critical parameters in the pp - rzf precoding because no monte - carlo averaging is required . </S>",
    "<S> several insights are also obtained through the analysis .    </S>",
