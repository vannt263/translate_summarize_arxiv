    "a fluid jet emanating from a nozzle will become unstable and break up due to surface tension .",
    "some 30 years ago , a series of papers @xcite investigated the modifications rayleigh s classical analysis would undergo if the jet performed a solid - body rotation . such a rotation",
    "is easily imparted by spinning the nozzle at the appropriate frequency .",
    "the somewhat surprising result of the linear analysis is that the rotation always _ destabilizes _ the jet , a wavenumber @xmath0 being unstable if @xmath1 with @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the surface tension , @xmath4 the density , @xmath5 the angular frequency , and @xmath6 the unperturbed jet radius .",
    "note that @xmath5 appears in the denominator , so no rotation corresponds to @xmath7 , for which the stability boundary @xmath8 found by plateau is recovered .",
    "the theoretical growth rates were found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment @xcite and growth of disturbances for @xmath9 larger than 1 was confirmed .",
    "recently it was pointed out by nagel @xcite that rotation might have an even more dramatic effect for the highly nonlinear motion near the point where the neck radius goes to zero . assume for the sake of the argument that a cylinder of fluid of length @xmath10 pinches uniformly , i.e. it retains its cylindrical shape .",
    "then the total angular momentum is @xmath11 and the volume @xmath12 is constrained to remain constant as @xmath6 goes to zero .",
    "the total interface pressure corresponding to the outward centripetal force is found to be @xmath13 , and thus @xmath14 as @xmath6 goes to zero , this outward pressure will _ dominate _ the surface tension pressure @xmath15 , raising the possibility that rotation is a singular perturbation for pinching : an arbitrarily small amount of angular momentum , caused by a symmetry breaking , could modify the breaking of a jet .",
    "however , a jet does not pinch uniformly , but rather in a highly localized fashion @xcite .",
    "if the above argument is applied to pinching , it must correspond to a rapidly spinning thread of fluid surrounded by almost stationary fluid .",
    "frictional forces represented by the viscosity of the fluid will lead to a diffusive transport of angular momentum out of the pinch region , thus reducing its effect . determining which effect dominates requires a fully nonlinear calculation , including effects of surface tension , viscosity , inertia , and centripetal forces . in the spirit of earlier work for @xmath16",
    "@xcite we will derive a one dimensional model , which only takes into account the leading order dependence of the velocity field on the radial variable .",
    "this will be done in the next section , together with a comparison of the linear growth rates between the model and the full navier - stokes calculation . in the third section",
    "we analyze the nonlinear behavior .",
    "first we investigate possible scaling solutions of the model equations , then we compare with numerical simulations . in the final section",
    ", we present some tentative conclusions .",
    "in our derivation of the slender jet model we closely follow @xcite . the navier - stokes equation for an incompressible fluid of viscosity @xmath17 read in cylindrical coordinates : @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20    with the incompressibility condition",
    "@xmath21 here we have assumed that the velocity field does not depend on the angle @xmath22 . exploiting incompressibility , @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "can be expanded in a power series in @xmath25 :    @xmath26    here and in the following a prime refers to differentiation with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "the crucial trick to make an expansion in @xmath25 work in the presence of rotation is to rewrite @xmath28 in terms of the angular momentum per unit length @xmath29 of the corresponding solid body rotation : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the local thread radius , hence no overturning of the profile is allowed .",
    "just as without rotation , the equation of motion for @xmath32 follows from mass conservation based on the leading order expression for @xmath23 : @xmath33 finally , the pressure is expanded according to @xmath34 plugging this into the equation of motion for @xmath24 , to leading order in @xmath25 one finds the balance @xmath35 while the leading balance for the @xmath23-equation remains @xmath36",
    "lastly , the @xmath37-equation leads to @xmath38 to leading order .    equations ( [ p2])-([lexp ] ) contain the unknown functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 which need to be determined from the boundary conditions .",
    "the normal stress balance @xmath42 gives @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the sum of the principal curvatures .",
    "as in the case without rotation , the tangential stress balance @xmath45 gives @xmath46 for @xmath47 pointing in the axial direction , but a new condition @xmath48 for @xmath47 pointing in the azimuthal direction .",
    "putting this together , one is left with a closed equation for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 : @xmath52 where we have dropped the subscript on @xmath50 .",
    "the same equations were derived independently by horvath and huber @xcite .",
    "the most obvious way to test this model is to compare with the known results for the stability of the full navier - stokes equation . to that end",
    "we linearize ( [ me ] ) about a solution with constant radius @xmath6 and rotation rate @xmath5 : @xmath53 eliminating @xmath54 , this leads to the equation @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are dimensionless .",
    "we have introduced the reynolds number @xmath58 , based on a balance of capillary and viscous forces .",
    "note that this convention differs from that of @xcite .",
    "putting @xmath59 one reproduces the exact stability boundaries ( [ stab ] ) .",
    "however one can see that the inviscid limit @xmath60 is a very singular one , in disagreement with the full solution .",
    "namely , for this limit one finds the three branches @xmath61 thus @xmath62 is the only unstable mode in the range @xmath63 , but goes to zero when the viscosity becomes small .",
    "the reason for this behavior , which is not found in the solution of the full equations , lies in the appearance of a very thin boundary layer for small viscosities @xcite .",
    "namely , rayleigh s stability criterion for a rotating fluid implies that the interior of the fluid is _",
    "stabilized_. this forces any disturbance to be confined to a boundary layer of thickness @xmath64 near the surface of the jet , and @xmath65 becomes very small for @xmath66 . but this additional length scale is not captured by our slender jet expansion",
    ". only for high viscosities is the boundary layer smoothed out sufficiently , and from ( [ poly ] ) one finds the dispersion relation @xmath67 which is consistent with the full theory in the limit of small @xmath68 .",
    "our main interest lies of course in the behavior close to pinch - off .",
    "close to the singularity , one expects the motion to become independent of initial conditions , so it is natural to write the equations of motion in units of the material parameters of the fluid alone .",
    "in addition to the known @xcite units of length and time , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , one finds an angular momentum scale @xmath71 .",
    "note that this scale is only about @xmath72 g cm / s for water , corresponding to a frequency of @xmath73 for a 1 mm jet , so even the smallest amount of rotation will be potentially relevant . rewriting the equations of motion ( [ me ] ) in units of @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , one can effectively put @xmath76 , leading to a universal form of the equations , independent of the type of fluid .",
    "in addition , one can look for similarity solutions @xcite of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the temporal and spatial distances from the singularity where @xmath49 goes to zero . we have assumed that everything has been written in units of the natural scales @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . by plugging ( [ sim ] ) into the equations of motion , and looking for solutions that balance the @xmath80-dependence ,",
    "one finds a unique set of values for the exponents : @xmath81 in addition , one obtains a set of three ordinary differential equations for the similarity functions",
    "@xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "so far we have not been able to find consistent solutions to these equations , which match onto a solution which is static on the time scale @xmath80 of the singular motion .",
    "this is a necessary requirement since the fluid will not be able to follow the singular motion as one moves away from the pinch point .",
    "this negative result is consistent with simulations of the equations for a variety of initial conditions . to avoid spurious boundary effects",
    ", we considered a solution of ( [ me ] ) with periodic boundary conditions in the interval @xmath84 $ ] and an additional symmetry around the origin .",
    "this ensures that the total angular momentum is conserved exactly .",
    "we took the fluid to be initially at rest and the surface to be @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "the angular momentum was distributed uniformly with the initial value @xmath87 , corresponding to @xmath88    = 0.4    = 0.6    = 0.6    figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] show a numerical simulation of ( [ me ] ) with @xmath89 and @xmath90 using a numerical code very similar to the one described in @xcite . written in units of the intrinsic angular momentum scale , @xmath91 ,",
    "so @xmath51 is potentially relevant .",
    "the thread pinches on either side of the minimum , pushing fluid into the center .",
    "as seen in the profiles of @xmath51 , the angular momentum is expelled very rapidly from the regions where @xmath49 goes to zero and also concentrates in the center .",
    "this is confirmed by a plot of the minimum of @xmath51 versus the minimum of @xmath49 .",
    "on the basis of the similarity solution ( [ sim ] ) , a power law @xmath92 is to be expected . instead , fig . [ fig3 ] shows that @xmath93 decays more rapidly , making angular momentum asymptotically irrelevant .",
    "indeed , a comparison of the similarity function @xmath22 as found from the present simulation shows perfect agreement with the scaling theory in the absence of rotation @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath93 should in principal be derivable from the linear equation for @xmath51 with known time - dependent functions @xmath32 and @xmath94 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath93 does not seem to follow a simple scaling law except below @xmath95 , where the power is close to 3.13 .",
    "it is not clear how to extract this power analytically .",
    "= 0.6    one might think that by increasing the angular momentum the system would cross over to a different behavior . to test this ,",
    "the initial angular momentum was doubled to give @xmath96 . at @xmath97 centripetal and surface tension forces",
    "are balanced , so decreasing @xmath98 significantly below this value will cause rotation to be important initially .",
    "indeed , instead of pinching down immediately , the fluid is first pulled into a narrow disc , while the radius of the surrounding fluid remains constant , cf .",
    "eventually this outward motion stops , as surface tension and centripetal forces reach an equilibrium . only then does the fluid pinch down at the edge of the disc .",
    "the behavior close to the pinch point is however exactly the same as for smaller angular momentum . as a word of caution",
    ", one must add that our model is certainly not valid at the edges of the disk , where slopes become very large .",
    "in fact , the very sharp gradients encountered in this region may be due to the fact that the fluid really wants to develop _",
    "plumes_. as is observed for low viscosity @xcite , the viscous terms prevent the interface from overturning , but at the cost of producing unrealistically sharp gradients .",
    "the present investigation is only a first step towards the understanding of the role of rotation in droplet pinching .",
    "a major challenge lies in finding a description valid at low viscosities .",
    "this can perhaps be done by incorporating the boundary layer structure near the surface into the slender jet approximation .",
    "the relevance of this lies in the fact that angular momentum is potentially more important at low viscosities , when there is less frictional transport out of the pinch region .",
    "in fact it can be shown that the inviscid version of ( [ me ] ) does not describe breakup at all , since centripetal forces will always dominate asymptotically .",
    "this result is of course only of limited use since the model equations are definitely flawed in that regime .",
    "in addition , there remains the possibility that a region in parameter space exists where angular momentum modifies breakup even at finite viscosities .",
    "we can not make a definite statement since the additional variable makes it hard to scan parameter space completely .",
    "finally , spinning jets have not received much attention in terms of experiments probing the non - linear regime .",
    "the discs found at high spinning rates ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) are a tantalizing new feature , and to our knowledge have not been found experimentally .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath98 reported in @xcite is 0.43 , which is even larger than the value of fig .",
    "however , 0.0625 would easily be reachable by increasing the jet radius .",
    "the authors are indebted to sid nagel for pointing out this problem and for stimulating discussions .",
    "j.e . thanks howard stone for his hospitality , which he has shown in so many ways , and for stimulating discussions .",
