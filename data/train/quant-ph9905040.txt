    "due to recent experimental efforts to detect gravitational waves @xcite , the problem of fundamental limitations on the detection sensitivity imposed by the quantum nature of the measurement device has become of practical importance .",
    "the research during the last decade focused mostly on interferometric schemes in which the relative shift in the positions of two end mirrors , caused by a gravitational wave , results in a phase shift between the light beams in the two arms . this phase shift can be detected by measuring the output light .",
    "the first analysis of quantum limitations on the measurement sensitivity in such an interferometric scheme was made by caves @xcite in the early eighties . according to this analysis , there are two sources of quantum noise : the photon - counting noise and the radiation - pressure noise .",
    "when these two sources of noise are balanced by adjusting the light intensity , the sensitivity achieves the so - called standard quantum limit ( sql ) .",
    "more recently , pace _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied quantum limitations on the interferometer sensitivity using a more detailed analysis based on a hamiltonian description of the interaction of light with the movable end mirrors .",
    "some other works @xcite were devoted to the study of quantum noise reduction in simpler optical systems : a light beam reflected by a movable mirror or a single fabry - prot cavity with one movable mirror .",
    "assuming high light intensities , the above works mostly employed semi - classical calculational techniques , with the quantum fluctuations of the light field considered as a small addition to the large classical amplitude .",
    "the quantum theory of the radiation - pressure fluctuations on a mirror was also studied in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a simple but nevertheless instructive system , consisting of a cavity radiation field interacting with a movable mirror @xcite . as was shown recently @xcite , such a system",
    "can be utilized to generate a variety of non - classical states ( especially , the so - called schrdinger - cat states ) of both the cavity field and the mirror .",
    "we employ the fully quantum description of the system and study quantum statistical properties of the cavity field . while the photon statistics of the field does not change during the interaction , the phase distribution and quadrature fluctuations exhibit interesting dynamics .",
    "if the mirror ( modelled by a quantum harmonic oscillator ) is driven by an external classical force , this will result in a phase shift of the cavity mode .",
    "we study quantum limitations imposed on the detection of the force by the intrinsic quantum uncertainty in a measurement of this phase shift .",
    "it is satisfactory to find that the sql for the measurement of the mirror position naturally emerges from the dynamical properties of the system . on the other hand",
    ", the sensitivity of the force detection in this scheme does not reach the corresponding sql .",
    "we also show that analytical approximations made to describe phase properties of the field should work very well for light intensities needed to achieve the sql in appropriate experimental setups .",
    "as is well known , the sql arises due to the heisenberg uncertainty relation for the position and momentum of the movable mirror .",
    "this limit can be understood conceptually by considering a simple measurement scheme consisting of a movable mirror ( modelled , for example , by a linear harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath0 and angular frequency @xmath1 ) and a monochromatic light beam of angular frequency @xmath2 .",
    "a shift @xmath3 in the mirror position , caused by an external classical force ( e.g. , by a gravitational wave ) , results in a phase shift @xmath4 of the reflected light beam ( here @xmath5 is the velocity of light ) .",
    "such a scheme is referred to as an optomechanical sensor .",
    "the experimental progress towards the observation of quantum limits in such a sensor was reported recently in @xcite .",
    "for a recent theoretical treatment of such a scheme , including a detailed analysis of various sources of noise , see @xcite .",
    "if the incident light beam is in a coherent state with mean photon number @xmath6 , the phase uncertainty is @xmath7 ( provided that @xmath8 ) .",
    "this phase - fluctuation noise results in the uncertainty @xmath9 in the measurement of the mirror position . increasing the light intensity , one can suppress the phase - fluctuation noise , but this leads to increased fluctuations in the radiation pressure which on the average transfers the momentum @xmath10 to the mirror .",
    "these radiation - pressure fluctuations result in the mirror position uncertainty @xmath11 . optimizing the sum @xmath12 as a function of @xmath6 , one finds the uncertainty @xmath13 which is @xmath14 times the sql for a harmonic oscillator , @xmath15 the optimum mean number of photons is @xmath16    in many applications ( e.g. , for detection of gravitational waves ) it makes sense to consider what limitations apply due to the quantum nature of the measuring apparatus on the detection of a weak classical force coupled to the oscillator @xcite . consider a constant force @xmath17 that acts on the mirror during time @xmath18 which is much shorter than the oscillator period @xmath19 . in order to detect this force",
    ", the momentum @xmath20 it transfers to the mirror should be larger than the sql for the measurement of the oscillator momentum , @xmath21 . correspondingly , the minimum detectable force is @xmath22    it was argued @xcite that the sql on the detection of a weak classical force ( which causes the displacement of the movable mirror in the sensor ) can be surpassed using correlations between the phase - fluctuation noise and the radiation - pressure noise . in particular ,",
    "it was predicted @xcite that amplitude - phase correlations , created by the nonlinear interaction between the movable mirror and the radiation pressure , will produce squeezing in the reflected beam .",
    "consequently , it was proposed @xcite to use homodyne detection of the squeezed quadrature in order to compensate for the radiation - pressure noise , thereby making it possible to overcome the sql with high enough light intensity .",
    "the solution of the wave equation for the radiation field in a cavity with moving boundaries is in general a very complicated problem even in the classical case @xcite .",
    "however , in the adiabatic approximation , when the amplitude and frequency of the mirror motion are much smaller than the wavelength and frequency of the cavity mode , the dynamics of the system can be described by an effective hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "of course , all phenomena associated with the dynamical casimir effect ( e.g. , the resonant generation of photons ) are neglected in this description .",
    "the free hamiltonian for the system of the radiation field in a linear cavity with one movable mirror is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the angular frequency and the boson annihilation operator of the cavity mode , while @xmath1 and @xmath26 are the angular frequency and the annihilation operator of the movable mirror modelled by a quantum harmonic oscillator . for a cavity of free length @xmath27",
    ", one has @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "if the mirror displacement from the equilibrium position is @xmath3 , then the cavity length changes @xmath30 , and the cavity angular frequency changes as @xmath31 therefore , the effective interaction hamiltonian reads @xmath32 where @xmath33 here , @xmath0 is the mass of the movable mirror .",
    "if , in addition , we assume that the mirror is driven by a classical external time - dependent force @xmath34 , the corresponding part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath35 then the total hamiltonian @xmath36 reads @xmath37    it is known that the time evolution operator for this system can be written in a closed form @xcite .",

    "also , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are dimensionless functions of time : @xmath46 an interesting feature of this system is that for times @xmath47 ( i.e. , after a full cycle of the mirror oscillatory motion ) , one finds @xmath48 , and the field and mirror subsystems become fully disentangled ( if they were uncorrelated initially ) .",
    "furthermore , at these moments , the mirror returns to its initial state .",
    "this effect is quite general as it does not depend on the initial states of the subsystems .",
    "another interesting property is that the photon statistics of the cavity field does not change during the interaction .",
    "the existence of the closed form ( [ eq : ut1 ] ) for the evolution operator can be understood if we note that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : htot ] ) is given by a linear combination of operators which close an algebra .",
    "first , recall that a solvable lie algebra ( the so - called oscillator algebra ) is closed by the four operators @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the number operator and @xmath51 is the identity operator .",

    "let us consider a situation in which both the cavity field and the mirror oscillator are initially prepared in coherent states with coherent amplitudes @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively : @xmath68 in fact , a quite reasonable choice is to assume that the mirror is initially in the vacuum state ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) , but first we will consider an arbitrary @xmath67 for the sake of generality . acting on the initial state ( [ eq : psi0 ] ) with the evolution operator ( [ eq : ut2 ] ) , one obtains : @xmath70^n } { \\sqrt{n ! } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times e^ { i \\mu(\\tau ) k^2 n^2 } |n\\rangle_c \\otimes       \\label{eq : psi - tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the reference frame rotating with the field frequency @xmath24 , the phase @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 .\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "obviously , the poissonian photon statistics of the cavity field is preserved during the evolution .",
    "as can be seen from equations ( [ eq : psi - tau ] ) and ( [ eq : zeta ] ) , the external force acting on the mirror produces a phase shift of the cavity mode . at least in principle , this phase shift can be measured , thereby revealing information about the classical force .",
    "accuracy of such a measurement will inevitably depend on the phase properties of the radiation mode , because an externally induced phase shift is detectable only if it is larger than the intrinsic phase uncertainty of the field .      in quantum mechanics ,",
    "one can describe a measurement by the corresponding positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xcite .",
    "the so - called canonical povm for an idealized phase measurement is given by @xcite @xmath79 the corresponding phase distribution for the cavity field is @xmath80 = ( 2\\pi)^{-1 } \\langle\\theta | \\rho_c | \\theta\\rangle .\\ ] ] substituting expression ( [ eq : rho - c ] ) for @xmath81 into ( [ eq : pt - def ] ) , we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 . for @xmath69",

    "however , existence of an experimental procedure for phase measurement with the canonical povm ( [ eq : povm - def ] ) is still an open question . on the other hand , a possible way to measure the phase of the radiation field mode is by means of heterodyne detection ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . relating to our model",
    ", a possible experimental procedure might be as follows . at some moment @xmath18",
    "one stops the interaction between the field and the movable mirror ( by fixing the mirror position ) and lets the radiation leak from the cavity .",

    "the two fourier components of the photocurrent are proportional to the quadratures of the cavity field at the moment @xmath18 , which can be used to determine the phase .",

    "for a cavity with a very high finesse and a mirror oscillator with a very high quality factor , neglecting the losses can be a fair approximation for short interaction times , say , for @xmath116 s. therefore , for low - frequency oscillators ( with @xmath117 hz , as in the ligo interferometric gravitational - wave detectors @xcite ) , it is reasonable to consider @xmath118 .",
    "for such small values of @xmath119 we can use approximate expressions for @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "we chose such a large @xmath145 only in order to deal with smaller values of @xmath125 and thereby avoid overflows in numerical calculations .",
    "however , this artificial scaling does not distort the physical behavior of the system .",
    "let us consider what will happen for a realistic value of @xmath145 ( e.g. , @xmath147 for the ligo detectors ) .",
    "then one obtains a much larger value of @xmath124 ( e.g. , @xmath148 for the ligo detectors with the cavity storage time about @xmath149 s ) .",
    "therefore , our approximations might be used , but for very large values of @xmath125 .",

    "now , let us consider what this phase uncertainty means regarding the measurement of the mirror shift .",

    "this result just reflects the fact that in our model the information about the system is inferred from a `` single - shot '' phase measurement at the time @xmath18 , and not from a continuous monitoring of the system . in the case of a force @xmath17 which is constant during the time @xmath18",
    ", we obtain @xmath166 the minimum detectable force @xmath167 is determined from the condition @xmath168 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath169 so , with the method presented here , the minimum detectable force is quite far from the sql .",
    "this result shows that the genuine sensitivity in a specific scheme can differ significantly from the commonly accepted sql for an abstract oscillator .",
    "it is well known ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) that homodyne detection with a strong local oscillator can be used to measure the rotated field quadrature @xmath170 the angle @xmath171 is the phase of the local oscillator .",

    "also , in the relevant limits @xmath107 and @xmath163 , an approximate expression is obtained @xmath180 @xmath181 the variance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : varx - appr ] ) is minimized for @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "then we find @xmath184 which is always larger than @xmath185 .",

    "for the parameters taken , the approximation ( [ eq : varx - appr ] ) is excellent , and the quadrature uncertainty @xmath175 reaches a minimum for @xmath171 about @xmath186 ( i.e. , for @xmath187 ) . the value of @xmath175 at this minimum is plotted in fig .  5 versus @xmath125 for several interaction times .",

    "it should be clearly understood that we have no intention to claim that the idealized system discussed in this paper might be immediately used as a practical sensor of weak classical forces ( e.g. , for detection of gravitational waves ) .",
    "our study is aimed at understanding the most basic properties of the quantum dynamics of the radiation field in a cavity with a movable mirror .",
    "the evolution of the field phase distribution , studied in the framework of a fully quantum approach , is of interest because it helps to clarify how the information about an external force is carried by the light field in much more complicated realistic measurement schemes .",
    "in fact , it is very instructive to see how the evolution of the field phase uncertainty determines the sensitivity of the scheme and naturally implies the sql on the measurement of the mirror position .",
    "it should be emphasized that in our model we assumed that the information about the phase shift accumulated by the cavity field is read by means of a `` single - shot '' phase measurement .",
    "of course , this only gives information about the integrated effect of an external force during the measurement time .",
    "however , if one wants to determine the time dependence of the force , this will require a continuous monitoring of the field phase . in a consistent quantum description",
    ", one should take into account that the evolution of the system under the continuous measurement will be seriously affected by the measurement - induced state reduction . a model of continuous broadband measurement for monitoring the position of a free mass",

    "<S> a quantum system composed of a cavity radiation field interacting with a movable mirror is considered and quantum statistical properties of the field are studied . </S>",
    "<S> such a system can serve in principle as an idealized meter for detection of a weak classical force coupled to the mirror which is modelled by a quantum harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the standard quantum limit on the measurement of the mirror position arises naturally from the properties of the system during its dynamical evolution . however , the force detection sensitivity of the system falls short of the corresponding standard quantum limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the effect of the nonlinear interaction between the moving mirror and the radiation pressure on the quadrature fluctuations of the initially coherent cavity field .    2 </S>"
