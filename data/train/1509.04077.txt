    "turbulence is a common phenomenon in various environments , e.g. , laboratorial @xcite , space , and astrophysical plasmas @xcite . in the heliosphere",
    "the solar wind is deemed to be an ideal natural laboratory to investigate plasma turbulence , since particles and fields can be measured in - situ and the solar wind is approximately boundless for the turbulent eddies / fluctuations therein .",
    "the magnetic fluctuations are often correlated with the velocity fluctuations . together with the weak compressibility of the magnetic field strength",
    ", this indicates the dominance of alfvnic fluctuations in the turbulence @xcite .",
    "the so - called elssser variables , which are defined as a sum or difference of fluctuations for velocity and magnetic field in alfvn unit ( @xmath0 ) , have often been employed in theoretical calculations to study the counter - propagating waves in alfvnic turbulence . from the space observation point of view",
    ", the nature of the minor ( subdominant ) elssser variable remains unknown , although it is assumed to represent sunward / inward alfvn waves in the scenario of alfvnic turbulence .",
    "however , this notion has not yet been confirmed .",
    "nevertheless , sunward propagating alfvn waves with the absence of anti - sunward alfvn waves are identified in upstream regions of the bow shock @xcite and in some streams of the pristine solar wind @xcite .    the minor elssser field",
    "may also be associated with convected magnetic structures , which would also contribute to the observed excess of magnetic energy over kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is still unclear whether @xmath1 represents inward waves and/or involves mostly nonlinear interaction with the outward @xmath2 .",
    "the compressibility of solar wind turbulence usually manifests itself in pressure - balanced structures of various types @xcite , which may come in the form of spaghetti - like flux tube stemming from the sun @xcite , quasi - perpendicular kinetic slow magnetosonic waves @xcite , or mirror - mode structures @xcite .",
    "the nature of @xmath1 and its relation to compressibility will be investigated here .",
    "turbulence is thought to be dissipated through the damping of small - scale kinetic waves or via currents in coherent structures , and can thereby heat the plasma through energy conversion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , both linear and nonlinear resonances between waves and particles can break the adiabatic behavior of particles @xcite .",
    "resonance diffusion plateaus of various types , e.g. , landau resonance and left / right cyclotron resonance , seem to be consistent with the measured contours of proton velocity distributions in fast solar wind streams @xcite , where turbulence is dominated by alfvn waves from the sun .",
    "non - resonant ( stochastic ) heating might be important in regions with extremely low plasma beta , e.g. , close to the solar corona @xcite .",
    "dissipation of strong current density within coherent structures may also be an important source of local heating @xcite . but how particles are heated in compressible mhd turbulence involving counter - propagating waves still remains to be understood .",
    "this question will also be studied here in detail by use of wind in - situ particle and field measurements .",
    "the solar wind observations presented here are from the wind spacecraft , and are based on the plasma and magnetic field data provided respectively by the 3dp and mfi instruments @xcite . the time interval for our study is [ 15:00 , 18:00 ] on 2012/12/31 .",
    "time profiles of parameters , i.e. , proton number density ( @xmath3 ) , bulk velocity components ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) , magnetic field components ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) , are illustrated in the left panels of figure  1 .",
    "the parallel and the first and second perpendicular directions are defined as the directions of @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath10 represents the mean magnetic field direction pointing anti - sunward in this case , and @xmath13 is the gse x - direction .",
    "it is surprising to find that : @xmath4 is positively correlated with @xmath7 , indicating sunward smws propagating obliquely to @xmath10 ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are anti - correlated respectively with @xmath8 and @xmath9 , indicating anti - sunward propagating aws .",
    "the finding of sunward propagating smws is also confirmed by the anti - correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the right panels of figure  1 illustrate the cross - correlation spectra calculated by means of the formula , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the wavelet coefficient spectra of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "spectra of negative @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and positive @xmath21 are clear evidence of sunward oblique smws . for oblique smws",
    ", the density fluctuation is driven by longitudinal compression / expansion , and the magnetic field pressure is almost in balance with the thermal pressure .",
    "the anti - sunward aws are characterized by spectra having negative @xmath22 .",
    "the evidence of counter - propagating waves is solid , and not affected by the definition of @xmath10 , whether it is a global mean field averaged over the whole time interval ( figure  1b-1e ) or a local mean magnetic field direction as introduced by @xcite ( figure  1g-1j ) .",
    "the elssser variables @xmath23 are calculated by @xmath24 , with @xmath25 being the proton density averaged over the interval of [ 15:00 , 18:00 ] ut .",
    "the trace power spectral densities ( psd ) of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are illustrated in figure  2a and 2b .",
    "the related spectral indices are found by power - law fitting to be @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the characteristic directions of @xmath23 fluctuations are estimated by applying the singular - value - decomposition method @xcite to the spectral matrix of @xmath23 .",
    "the directions with maximum singular values are regarded as the oscillation directions . the direction with minimum singular value",
    "is deemed a good proxy for the propagation direction , if the elssser fluctuations are ideally incompressible .",
    "the spectra of the angles between the derived `` oscillation '' or `` propagation '' direction and the local mean magnetic field directions ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) as a function of time and period are illustrated in figure  2c , 2d , 2e , 2f .",
    "the angle @xmath34 in figure  2c is basically smaller than @xmath38 , indicating longitudinal oscillation of @xmath26 .",
    "large angles @xmath35 in figure  2d suggest a transverse oscillation of @xmath27 .",
    "the oscillation difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 demonstrates the intrinsically different natures of @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with the former and latter pertaining to the sunward smws and anti - sunward aws , respectively .",
    "figure  2e shows that the majority of @xmath36 is larger than @xmath39 , while @xmath40 in figure  2f displays a scattered probability distribution . to be cautious , @xmath36 may not be the real propagation angle of smws due to the compressibility of @xmath26 .",
    "the derived @xmath41 for alfvn waves may be either the real propagation direction @xmath42 or @xmath10 .",
    "the patches of @xmath43 in figure  2 g may infer the nonlinear action of aws ( @xmath27 ) on smws ( @xmath26 ) ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the aws may be shorn by the smws when @xmath45 ( figure  2h ) , which may lead to a transverse cascade of aws .",
    "the proton 2d velocity distribution functions ( vdfs ) in the top panels of figure  3 illustrate the bi - directional asymmetric beams along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "such a twofold beam pattern has , to our knowledge , not been reported before . as compared to the anti - sunward beam , which appears prolonged in @xmath4 and broad in @xmath46 , the sunward beam looks relatively shorter in @xmath4 and narrower in @xmath46 .",
    "we interpret this new observational pattern as probable evidence of wave - particle interaction between protons and counter - propagating waves .",
    "the anti - sunward beam may be the result of landau and right - cyclotron resonance with the outward oblique aws at kinetic scales ( generalized kinetic alfvn waves ) , the wave signatures of which had been reported in previous studies @xcite .",
    "the sunward beam may be formed via landau resonance with kinetic smws , the wave features of which have been studied in linear theory @xcite .",
    "in other time intervals , without clear signatures of counter - propagating mhd waves , the bi - directional asymmetric beams in the vdfs are absent .",
    "the proton 1d reduced vdfs in the bottom panels of figure  3 show a plateau and an extended tail on the sunward and anti - sunward sides respectively .",
    "it is exciting to find that the plateau positions coincide well with the field - projected phase speed of quasi - perpendicular smws ( vertical dotted line in panels ) , which indicates a landau resonance between protons and sunward smws .",
    "the dispersion relation for quasi - perpendicular smw yields approximately @xmath47 , with @xmath48 and @xmath49 being the alfvn speed and ion sound speed respectively .",
    "the propagation of quasi - perpendicular smws can also be described by the equations derived for the generalized elssser fields @xcite .",
    "but they have never before been analyzed observationally .",
    "smws in the extreme limit of @xmath50 are also named as pseudo - alfvnic waves , which is passive scattered / mixed by alfvn waves with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "alfvn waves with considerable @xmath51 may also be distorted by the quasi - perpendicular smws leading to larger @xmath52 due to the nonlinear term @xmath53 in the convective derivative .",
    "on the basis of the observational findings presented here , a new scenario of compressible plasma turbulence is proposed and illustrated in figure  4 .",
    "dominant aws are propagating anti - sunward and quasi - perpendicular smws are propagating upstream against the aws .",
    "the nonlinear interaction during collisions between these counter - propagating waves may lead for both waves to a cascade of wave energy towards plasma kinetic scales .",
    "meanwhile , in response to the counter - propagating waves , bi - directional asymmetric beams emerge in the proton vdfs through resonant wave - particle interactions . in this way",
    ", the turbulence energy cascading and dissipation as well as the solar wind ion heating are included in this common scenario .",
    "this new type of turbulence , which is unusual in the solar wind fast streams , is different from the traditional paradigm , where counter - propagating waves are both alfvnic but not yet confirmed observationally .",
    "some new challenges are raised along with these findings .",
    "( 1 ) how are the sunward smws generated in the solar wind turbulence : is it by compression between streams , the parametric decay from aws @xcite , or by other processes ? ( 2 ) the observed compressible mhd turbulence and the concurrent collisionless damping of kinetic waves , together call for a more comprehensive study , involving numerical modeling and observational statistical analysis .",
    "( 3 ) what is the radial evolution in the solar wind of the compressible turbulence , involving aws and smws , which have also been identified in the solar wind source region ? ( 4 ) besides the local wave - particle interactions , effects of large - scale evolution ( e.g. , anisotropic cooling during expansion , gravity , charge - separation electric field , mirror force , and differential flows between species ) need to be taken into account for the proton kinetics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are issues that may well be addressed by the upcoming missions solar orbiter and solar probe plus , which will be `` sailing against the solar wind '' into the inner heliosphere and outer corona .",
