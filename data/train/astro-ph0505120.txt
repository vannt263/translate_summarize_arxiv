    "the net , on  source exposure times were 4.7 , 9.0 , and 12.9 ksec , respectively .",
    "we limited the readout area of the s3chip to 1/8th of its original size yielding a smaller exposure time per ccd frame in order to avoid pile  up .",
    "after the data were processed by the _ chandra _ x  ray center ( ascds version 7.5.0 ) , we analysed them using the _ ciao 3.2.1 _ software developed by the chandra x  ray center .",
    "we searched the data for background flares but none were found , hence we used all data in our analysis .",
    "we extracted data from a circular area with a radius of three pixels ( @xmath16 ) centred on the best  fit source position for the first two observations .",
    "this area encloses 9095 per cent of the energy since , as we will show below , the source spectrum is not very hard .",
    "the reason why we use this small area is to exclude as much as possible background photons .",
    "in such a small area one expects 1@xmath171 background photon for the first observation . during the third observation ( mjd  53407.57 )",
    "the count rate is higher than in the previous two observation ( see below ) , which led us to use a six pixel ( @xmath18 ) radius circular area centred on the source position for the source extraction .    in the three observations we detect respectively 36 , 63 , and 190 photons from a position consistent with that found in the optical by @xcite and in x ",

    "this yields 0.310 kev count rates of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 counts per second .",

    "the count rate for the third observation is @xmath3 times as high as that of the average of the first two observations . due to",
    "the low number of source counts the cash statistic was used for the spectral analysis of the first two observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that the background should not be subtracted when fitting the spectrum in order to maintain the counting statistics ( although with a background as low as that in our case , this should not make much difference ) . for the extraction of the background spectrum in the third observation",
    ", we used an annulus with radius of 515 \" .",
    "we rebinned the source spectrum of the third observation such that each bin contains at least 10 counts .",
    "we fitted the spectra in the 0.310 kev range using xspec ( @xcite ) version 11.3.1 . since 10 counts per bin",
    "is still low for the use of @xmath19 statistics in the spectral fits of the third observation , we compared the results using the @xmath19 statistics with those obtained using the cash statistics ; the results are the same within the errors .",
    "for each observation separately we searched for variability in the lightcurve . only in the last observation ( i d 6181 )",
    "is there evidence that the source count rate was higher towards the end of the observation than near the start of the observation ( see figure  [ lightc ] ) . a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test ( see @xcite ) testing the hypothesis that the count rate of the source is constant showed that the probability that the count rate is constant is 0.36 , 0.36 , and 8.4@xmath20 for observation with i d 6179 , 6180 , 6181 , respectively ( i.e.  the hypothesis is observed to be disproven at the 4.1@xmath21 level for the third observation ) .",
    "we searched for spectral variability within an observation by making hardness ratios for the first and second half of the total number of photons detected during each observation and by investigating the photon energy as a function of photon arrival time .",
    "the hardness is defined as the count rate ratio between the 0.31.5 kev band and the 1.510 kev band .",
    "there is no evidence for significant changes in the hardness ratio during any of the observations . to check whether the hardness ratio changes between the observations we calculated the hardness ratio from all photons detected during one observation .",
    "the hardness ratio during the first , second and third observation is 2.8@xmath171.1 , 1.3@xmath170.3 , and 2.3@xmath170.4 , respectively",
    ". the hardness ratio of the third observation is larger than that of the second observation , albeit at the 2  @xmath21 level .        in order to check whether the spectrum changed between the observations we fitted the spectra for each of the observations separately .",
    "we fit the spectra using several functions that are often used for quiescent neutron stars : a power ",
    "law , an nsa , and a black  body model , all of these were modified by the effects of interstellar absorption . in these",
    "fits the value of the interstellar absorption , @xmath22 , was fixed to 2.8@xmath23 similar to the value found by @xcite . when we left the @xmath22 as a free parameter in the spectral fits for the third observation the @xmath22 was consistent with 2.8@xmath23 .",
    "as an indication of the influence that fixing the n@xmath11 has on the fit parameters we include the results of a blackbody , a power  law , and a blackbody fit to the first , second , and third observation , respectively , in table  1 .",
    "for the nsa model the neutron star radius and mass are fixed to 10 km and 1.4 m@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we assumed that the neutron star magnetic field is so low that it is unimportant for the nsa modelling , leaving only the normalisation ( i.e.  one divided by the source distance squared ) and the effective temperature as free parameters in this model .",
    "the results of these fits are shown in table  1 .",
    "the likelihood ratio method , which is the basis of the cash statistic , does not provide a direct test to the goodness  of  fit which would help one to distinguish between different models ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in order to obtain a handle on the goodness  of ",
    "fit we used monte carlo simulations .",
    "they consist of simulating 10@xmath25 counts spectra .",
    "each spectrum is drawn from a parent distribution with poisson statistics .",
    "the parent distribution is allowed to vary according to the covariances of the best ",
    "fit model parameters .",
    "the c fit ",
    "statistic for each of the monte carlo simulations is compared with that of the best ",
    "fit model .",
    "after the monte carlo simulations have been performed the fraction of simulations that gave a lower fit statistic than that of the best ",
    "fit model is given .",
    "this percentage is called the _",
    "goodness_. if the model provides a good description of the data the goodness should be close to 50 per cent . both a very low goodness and a very high goodness indicate that the model does not represent the data accurately . as can be seen in table  1 , for many of the single component models for which n@xmath11 was held fixed at 2.8@xmath23 the goodness",
    "is not close to the nominal 50 per cent .",
    "however , in none of the case we can exclude the model at high significance based on the goodness .",
    "the spectral fits suggest that the spectrum of the source is harder during the second observation than during the first and third observation , as can be seen from a comparison between the best ",
    "fit power  law index or the blackbody / nsa temperature of the observations .",
    "besides the single component models we tried fitting a model comprised of a blackbody and a power law modified by the effects of interstellar absorption to the data in order to assess the contribution of a power law to the spectrum .",
    "however , due to the low number of detected photons during the first and second observation the fit parameters were unconstrained .",
    "a fit using such a fit function resulted in meaningful constraints only for the third observation ( and only when we kept the power ",
