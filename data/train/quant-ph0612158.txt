    "quantum mechanics has very different conceptual and mathematical characters from classical mechanics .",
    "the superposition and the entanglement ( nonseparability ) of quantum states make the difference clear .",
    "recently , these characterizations have been utilized for a newly developing quantum technology .",
    "actually , quantum entanglement is deeply related to quantum information processing ( qip)@xcite .",
    "the role of entanglement in quantum computing has been researched from various viewpoints . in particular",
    ", the generation of entangled states by quantum dynamics , or quantum algorithms , will give us useful information on the above task@xcite .",
    "recently , yu , brown , and chuang@xcite investigated the entanglement of unitary transformed thermal states in a liquid  state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) quantum computer .",
    "such states are defined as the density matrices transformed from the thermal state in it by a specific class of unitary operators .",
    "we call the unitary transformations bell  transformations . their definition will be explained in sec.[subsec : butts ] .",
    "furthermore , we call such states bell  transformed thermal states . the thermal state in ref.@xcite is separable ( i.e. , there is no quantum correlation)@xcite and characterized by two physical parameters : the one is the number of qubits , and the other is a measure of the state s polarization .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite studied two kinds of bell  transformations .",
    "one of their central interests is the difference between the bell  transformed thermal states and effective pure states .",
    "the effective pure state is the convex sum of the identity operator and a pure state , and a typical one is used in the current liquid",
    " state nmr quantum computer@xcite .",
    "they concluded that the former should be more easily entangled than the latter ; the bell  transformed thermal states can be entangled even in the physical parameter region where effective pure states are separable .",
    "their research is very important for the following three reasons .",
    "first , it gives an insight into the role of the entanglement in a liquid  state nmr quantum computer .",
    "et al_.@xcite pointed out that the effective pure states should be almost separable in the current liquid  state nmr experiments .",
    "after their study , various studies on the role of entanglement in liquid  state nmr quantum computing were done ( see ref.@xcite for additional references ) .",
    "one should note that the most natural quantum state is the thermal one in the liquid ",
    "state nmr and an effective pure state is constructed from it by a sequential operation of several quantum gates .",
    "therefore , the authors in ref.@xcite investigated the entanglement of a more elementary state than effective pure states in liquid ",
    "state nmr quantum computers .",
    "secondly , they attempted to reveal the role of mixed  state entanglement in quantum computing .",
    "its evaluation and the meaning of mixed states will be more subtle than the case of pure states .",
    "nevertheless , they can be characterized from the viewpoint of quantum communication . in particular",
    ", distillability is important@xcite .",
    "if a mixed state is distillable , it is useful for qip ( e.g. , quantum teleportation ) ; we can distill a maximal entangled state by using a number of the copies , and local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "accordingly , their research could lead to the alternative understanding of mixed  state entanglement from the viewpoint of quantum computing . finally ,",
    "as mentioned in the beginning of this section , their work is related to the generation of entanglement by quantum dynamics . actually , they found the difference of the entanglement generation between the two bell  transformations .    in this paper",
    ", we analytically derive the physical parameter region where the bell  transformed thermal states are entangled in a more general case ; specifically , the effect of the chemical shift@xcite is included in our hamiltonian .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite assumed that the zeeman energy of each nuclear spin which corresponds to a qubit is a common value for all .",
    "however , it implies that one ca nt access the individual qubit ; it is not a realistic model .",
    "including such an effect will be necessary to evaluate the attainability of entanglement from the thermal state in the experiments .",
    "moreover , the analysis taking account of the chemical shift will reveal how the difference between the bell  transformations reflect on the physical parameter region where the bell  transformed thermal states are entangled .",
    "our method of evaluating the entanglement is simple and straightforward : positive partial transposition ( ppt ) criterion@xcite .",
    "we analytically calculate the eigenvalues of the partial transposed bell  transformed thermal states and find the least ones .",
    "here , we would like to emphasize that , in ref.@xcite , the dr  cirac classification@xcite has been applied to the evaluation of the entanglement about two types of bell  transformed thermal states , but it does nt necessarily work in all cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] , we introduce the hamiltonian and the bell  transformations . as in ref.@xcite , we concentrate on two unitary operators of bell  transformations . in sec.[sec : nonsep ] , in the first , we explain how to specify an individual bipartition and briefly review the ppt criterion .",
    "next , we explain the bell",
    " diagonal state@xcite in @xmath0qubit system , which plays a central role in this paper .",
    "then , we show the main results in sec.[subsec : nonsep ] : the sufficient conditions for the nonseparability of the bell  transformed thermal states with respect to any bipartition . in sec.[sec : fs_fd ] , we show the necessary conditions for the full separability and the full distillability .",
    "in particular , we show the necessary and sufficient conditions for their full distillability when there is no chemical shift . in sec.[sec : bd ] , we examine the effect of the chemical shift on the boundary between the separability and the nonseparability determined by the ppt criterion . we summarize our results in sec.[sec : summary ] .",
    "furthermore , we briefly review the dr  cirac classification and show some examples which this method does nt work in appendix.[adx : note_dc ] .",
    "in a liquid  state nmr quantum computer , the qubit is the nuclear spin in the molecule .",
    "we assume the number of the qubits is @xmath0 in one molecule .",
    "the dipole ",
    "dipole interaction between the molecules in solutions are negligible because they randomly collide with each other@xcite .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the internal degrees of freedom ( i.e. , the nuclear spin ) of one molecule .",
    "let us define the computational bases as @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) .",
    "the subscription @xmath6 is the label of the qubit .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the following standard operators : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "we analyze the hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the zeeman energy of the @xmath13th qubit .",
    "note that we neglect the @xmath14coupling between the neighboring qubits because it is much smaller than the zeeman energy in a liquid  state nmr@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we do nt mention the relationship between the above computational basis and the physical spin state , and the hamiltonian([eq : hamiltonian ] ) is a mathematical model .",
    "we assume @xmath12 is positive when we derive our main results .",
    "however , the model includes the important physical effect ; every value of @xmath12 is different from each other , due to the chemical shift .",
    "the difference allows us to access each qubit individually . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "every @xmath12 is a common value .",
    "let us consider the separable state which is characterized by a set of physical parameters .",
    "our interest is the parameter region in which the state transformed from a separable one by quantum gates is a nonseparable one .",
    "therefore , we have to specify a suitable initial separable state and quantum gates which generate the entanglement in a liquid  state nmr quantum computer .",
    "first , we refer to the initial separable state .",
    "the system in a liquid  state nmr experiment is a thermal equilibrium state with high temperature .",
    "accordingly , the most natural choice for the initial state is the thermal state @xmath15 in our model , the hamiltonian @xmath16 is given by eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the inverse temperature and the partition function , respectively .",
    "notice that state([eq : thermal ] ) is a separable state with respect to any bipartition of the system .",
    "the physical parameters in eq.([eq : thermal ] ) are the number of the qubit @xmath0 , the zeeman energy of the @xmath13th qubit @xmath12 , and the inverse temperature @xmath17 , which are regarded as the free parameters . actually , the values of the parameters are restricted by the experiments for a liquid  state nmr quantum computing . for the comparison with ref.@xcite",
    ", we introduce the parameter @xmath19 , which is called a measure of the state s polarization in the reference .",
    "hereafter , we simply call it polarization",
    ". the physical meaning of @xmath20 is quite clear .",
    "let us consider the expectation value of the @xmath21 component of the total spin operator @xmath22 with respect to @xmath23 : @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the value of @xmath0 is fixed .",
    "the value of @xmath25 becomes larger as @xmath20 increases ; the system is strongly polarized in the direction of the @xmath21 axis . summarizing the above argument , we can say that the initial thermal state([eq : thermal ] ) is characterized by the number of qubits @xmath0 and the polarization @xmath20 .",
    "next , we explain the unitary operators for generating entanglement",
    ". we will have to investigate all types of the quantum gates which are considered as the generator of entanglement and essential parts in a quantum algorithm .",
    "however , this task will be very difficult .",
    "in this paper , as in ref.@xcite , we concentrate on the following two unitary operators : the controlled  not  hadamard ( ch ) transformation , @xmath26 , and the ch  fanout transformation , @xmath27 . the fanout gate @xmath28 is defined as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the above unitary operators are examples in quantum gates , but they include the essential quantum gates for the generation of entanglement : controlled  not gates and hadamard gates . in this case , they generate the entanglement between the first qubit and the remaining qubits . when we consider , for example , the case of @xmath32 and that the initial state is @xmath33 , we obtain the following results : @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    in summary , we examine the entanglement of the states @xmath36 we call the above states the bell  transformed thermal states .",
    "the above states are called the bell  transformed thermal states .",
    "the initial state @xmath23 is separable with any bipartition of the system for the arbitrary values of @xmath0 and @xmath37 .",
    "in order to study the entanglement of a system , it is necessary to specify the way to divide it into two parts .",
    "we divide the @xmath0qubit system into two subsystems , party a and party b , in the following@xcite .",
    "first , let us consider a set of binary numbers , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "when @xmath40 , let the @xmath13th qubit be in party a. on the other hand , when @xmath41 , it is in party b. we always set @xmath42 ; the first qubit is always in party a. for convenience , we introduce an integer @xmath43 . therefore ,",
    "a partition is specified if an integer @xmath44)$ ] is chosen ; we call such a partition the bipartition @xmath45 .",
    "let us choose , for instance , @xmath46 in the case of @xmath47 ( i.e. , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 ) .",
    "the elements of party a are the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd qubit , and party b contains only the 4th qubit .      the ppt criterion is the simple and computable way to investigate entanglement .",
    "we briefly recapitulate it .",
    "let us consider a density matrix @xmath51 in a quantum system with finite dimension @xmath52 .",
    "the total system is divided into two subsystems , system a and system b. introducing an orthonormal basis of the system a , @xmath53 and the system b , @xmath54 , we can expand the density matrix @xmath51 as follows : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a complex number and @xmath57 .",
    "next , using eq.([eq : gen_dm ] ) , we define the partial transposition of the density matrix with respect to the system b as @xmath58 then , we calculate the eigenvalues of @xmath59 and investigate their positivity .",
    "if all eigenvalues of eq.([eq : pt_genrho ] ) are positive ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) , it is called a density matrix with ppt . on the other hand ,",
    "if at least one eigenvalue of it is negative , it is called a density matrix with negative partial transposition ( npt ) .",
    "the most important thing is that there is the following criterion ( i.e. , ppt criterion ) : @xmath61 or , equivalently @xmath62 moreover , the following statement is also known@xcite : @xmath63      before showing the our results , we explain the special class of a density matrix , the bell  diagonal state@xcite .",
    "it plays a central role in later discussion .",
    "to begin , let us explain the generalized greenberger ",
    "zeilinger ( ghz ) state@xcite in the @xmath0qubit system @xmath64 where @xmath65 for the binary number @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath33 and @xmath33 .",
    "the symbol @xmath68 means a bit  flip of @xmath69 : @xmath70 .",
    "we can easily find the generalized ghz states are the elements of an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space corresponding to the @xmath0qubit system .",
    "we introduce the following density matrix : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bd_state ] ) is a bell  diagonal state in an @xmath0qubit system .",
    "we will show that @xmath74 and @xmath75 take the form of eq.([eq : bd_state ] ) in the next subsection .",
    "the reason why we introduce the bell  diagonal state is that we can easily obtain its partial transposition@xcite .",
    "we confirm this in the following procedure .",
    "first , let us consider a bipartition @xmath45 . secondly , we represent @xmath76 in the computational basis : @xmath77 .",
    "the diagonal parts of @xmath76 are @xmath78 and @xmath79 and are invariant under the partial transposition with respect to party b. the off  diagonal ones are @xmath80 and @xmath81 because @xmath82 .",
    "if the @xmath13th qubit is in party b ( i.e. , @xmath41 ) , the binary number @xmath69 of the off  diagonal parts is transformed into @xmath83 modulo @xmath84 ( e.g. , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) by partial transposition with respect to party b. on the other hand , if the @xmath13th qubit is in the party a ( i.e. , @xmath40 ) , the corresponding @xmath66 is unchanged ; @xmath87 . as a result",
    ", we obtain the following expression : @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",

    "using the standard relations @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , we obtain the following results : @xmath97 where @xmath98 . consequently ,",
    "both @xmath74 and @xmath75 are bell  diagonal states .",
    "let us define the mean values of the polarization of party a , @xmath99 and party b , @xmath100 for given @xmath69 and @xmath45 as follows : @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 . in eq.([eq",

    "the dr  cirac classification@xcite is a very effective way to evaluate the separability or the distillability of density matrices , of either pure or mixed states , in a multiqubit system , and it is widely used@xcite .",
    "however , we have to take care of using it ; we do nt always obtain information on their entanglement from the method proposed in ref.@xcite . in the appendix",
    ", we show several examples in which the method does nt work .",
    "unfortunately , we do nt know what kind of density matrices have the problem .",
    "nevertheless , in the end of the appendix , we propose the prescription to solve this problem in specific examples .",
    "first of all , we summarize the strategy of the dr  cirac classification . in order to evaluate the entanglement of a quantum state by the ppt criterion",
    ", one must examine the positivity of the partial transposed density matrices . in general",
    ", such tasks will be difficult as the number of qubits becomes large and many choices of bipartitions exist .",
    "on the other hand , if one uses the dr  cirac classification , it is only necessary to calculate some specific matrix elements of the state concerned .",
    "the main idea is that , using a sequence of local operations , one can transform an arbitrary density matrix @xmath51 in a @xmath0qubit system into the following state whose property of entanglement is easily examined : @xmath221 the original density matrix @xmath51 is related to @xmath222 by the following expressions : @xmath223 and @xmath224 .",
    "the property of @xmath222 is characterized as follows : @xmath225 or @xmath226 where @xmath227 .",
    "the most important key idea is that the entanglement does not increase through local operations .",
    "accordingly , if @xmath222 is a nonseparable state with a bipartition , @xmath51 is also such a state .",
    "it should be noticed that we obtain information on the entanglement of @xmath51 only if @xmath222 is a nonseparable state .",
    "now , we show three examples .",
    "the first one is the case in which the dr  cirac classification works well .",
    "the remaining two are not such cases .",
    "hereafter , we concentrate on a two  qubit system .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath45 in eqs.([eq : dsppt ] ) and ( [ eq : dsnpt ] ) is always @xmath228 . in the first ,",
    "let us consider the following state : @xmath229 where @xmath230 .",
    "the above density matrix is called an isotropic state@xcite . directly using the ppt criterion@xcite , we readily find @xmath231 is an entangled state if @xmath232 .",
    "on the other hand , we apply the dr ",
    "cirac method to @xmath231 .",
    "we obtain the following results : @xmath233 , @xmath234 , and @xmath235 .",
    "accordingly , using eq.([eq : dsnpt ] ) , we also find @xmath231 is an entangled one if @xmath232 .",
    "next , we consider a slight different state from @xmath231 @xmath236 where @xmath237 .",
    "notice that the condition for the nonseparability of @xmath238 is the same one as @xmath231 ; @xmath239 is an entangled state if @xmath232 .",
    "this result is quite natural , because the state @xmath231 is transformed into @xmath239 by a local unitary operator ; @xmath240 . on the other hand",
    ", we obtain the eigenvalues in the form of eq.([eq : ds ] ) as follows : @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath244 is less than @xmath245 for the arbitrary value of @xmath246 and the condition ( [ eq : dsppt ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this might imply that @xmath239 is always separable .",
    "however , @xmath239 is local unitary equivalent to the entangled state @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) . in conclusion",
    ", we ca nt obtain information on the entanglement of @xmath239 by the method in ref.@xcite , because the entangled state @xmath239 is transformed into a separable state by locc .",
    "the third example is related to the task in this paper .",
    "we consider the case of @xmath247 and @xmath248 in eq.([eq : rhoch ] ) .",
    "we have known the condition for the nonseparability of @xmath74 ; @xmath74 is an entangled state if @xmath249 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath244 is less than @xmath245 for any @xmath205 because @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "accordingly , we ca nt also obtain information on the entanglement of @xmath74 by the method in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors in ref.@xcite pointed out that the local operations can decrease the entanglement of the state concerned and an alternative method is necessary .",
    "in particular , they discussed a more effective procedure for evaluating entanglement than the local operations in the dr  cirac classification in terms of the mathematical theory of majorization . finally , we comment on a loop ",
    "hole in the dr  cirac classification from another point view : we attempt to construct a prescription to solve the problem .",
    "as has been mentioned , the isotropic state @xmath231 is transformed into @xmath239 by the local unitary operator @xmath253 .",
    "the method in ref.@xcite works for the former but not for the latter .",
    "this suggests that , by suitable local unitary operators , the state for which the dr  cirac classification does nt work , could be transformed into a proper one to which their method is applicable .",
    "let us consider the above third example .",
    "when we use the local unitary operator @xmath253 , the state concerned is transformed into @xmath254 , where @xmath255 , @xmath256 , and @xmath257 . calculating @xmath244 and @xmath245 , we can obtain the non  trivial expression for @xmath258 ; for example , @xmath258 is npt if and only if @xmath259 .",
    "if @xmath258 is entangled , the corresponding state @xmath74 is also considered to be entangled .",
    "therefore , we obtain the sufficient condition of the nonseparability for @xmath74 , by the use of the dr  cirac classification ; such a condition is just @xmath259 .",
    "this condition is equal to the one which is derived by the use of eq.([eq : npt_ch_wrt_k ] ) .",
    "it is necessary to examine whether such a prescription is generalized or not .",
