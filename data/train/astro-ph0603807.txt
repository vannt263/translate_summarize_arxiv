    "hydrodynamic instabilities of interfaces in the interstellar medium ( ism ) have received renewed attention in part due the remarkable hubble images of `` elephant trunks '' and `` pillars '' in the eagle nebula ( hester et al .",
    "1996 ; pound 1998 ) .",
    "most of the theoretical and simulation work has focused on the stability / instability of ionization fronts driven by uv radiation of nearby ob stars ( e.g. , mizuta et al . 2005 ; williams 2002 ) .",
    "the fronts may undergo acceleration so as to give the classical rayleigh - taylor instability but the influence of recombination may suppress the instability ( mizuta et al . 2005 ) .",
    "hunter , whitaker , and lovelace ( 1997 , 1998 ; hereafter papers 1 and 2 ) studied the stability of interfaces in more quiescent regions of the ism where the ionizing radiation is not important .",
    "they identified a new interfacial instability which is driven by self - gravity and acts at a density discontinuity .",
    "this self - gravity interfacial instability ( sgi ) persists in the static limit for all wavelengths and occurs in addition to the classical rayleigh - taylor instability . using a normal mode analysis , they derived the linear growth rate of the sgi in compressible media in relative motion ( allowing for the influence of kelvin - helmholtz instability ) . in the incompressible limit ,",
    "the growth rate for a perturbation @xmath0 of a planar interface is @xmath1 in equation ( [ rates ] ) , @xmath2 is the horizontal perturbation wave number ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 a constant background acceleration , and @xmath5 the gravitational constant .",
    "the mass densities of the lower and upper fluids are specified as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the second term gives the growth rate for the incompressible rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability , and the first term is the incompressible growth rate for the sgi .",
    "both instabilities persist in the static limit , but several important differences are evident .",
    "self - gravity knows no preferred direction , so the sgi is destabilizing across any density interface .",
    "an interface is rt unstable only if @xmath8 , such that the heavy fluid sits `` on top '' of the light fluid .",
    "the sgi growth rate depends upon the absolute densities of the fluids and their ratio but not the perturbation wavelength . the rt growth rate changes with perturbation wavelength and density ratio , but it does not depend upon the absolute densities in the fluids . given these dependencies , the sgi is expected to grow faster than the rt instability for a fixed value of @xmath4 when the perturbation wavelength is long enough such that @xmath9 in planar geometry , the growth rate for the sgi depends only weakly upon the jeans criterion for the fully compressible case and not at all upon the perturbation wavelength in the incompressible limit .",
    "the underlying reason that self - gravity is able to drive an instability for any wave number is that the configuration is not one of minimum energy .",
    "numerical studies contrasting the behaviours of the sgi and rt instabilities have been performed by hueckstaedt and hunter ( 2001 ; paper 3 ) and by hueckstaedt , peterson , and hunter ( 2005 ; paper 4 ) . in the nonlinear regime ,",
    "the sgi evolves such that the growth of tenuous bubbles outpaces that of dense spikes ; whereas , the rt instability is characterized by dense spikes streaming into the tenuous fluid . in previous work , we sought to isolate the sgi by creating a set of hydrostatic initial conditions such that the pressure gradient and the acceleration due to self - gravity are both zero across the density interface . in the present work ,",
    "we relax this restriction and allow them to be non - zero at the interface .",
    "the self - gravitational acceleration can effectively drive an rt - like instability provided the acceleration is in the same direction as the density gradient across the interface .",
    "although the self - gravitational acceleration varies with position , it may be roughly constant near the interface where the growth is strongest .",
    "this rt - like instability can not be strictly isolated because the sgi always will arise in the presence of a density interface .",
    "notwithstanding , the growth rate of the rt - like instability can be adjusted to grow faster than the sgi by increasing the acceleration at the interface or decreasing the perturbation wavelength .",
    "section 2 describes the envisioned equilibrium configurations , while  3 describes the two - dimensional computer simulations .",
    "section 4 discusses the results of our simulations , and  5 gives the conclusions of this work .",
    "in order to isolate the gravitational instabilities , simulations are begun from a state of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the geometry of the problem is shown in figure [ setup ] .    ]",
    "the interfacial values of the equilibrium densities and temperatures in the two regions are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and the interfacial pressure @xmath12 is the same for both media .",
    "the densities and pressures lapse to zero at heights @xmath13 below and @xmath14 above the interface . for rt simulations ,",
    "a constant acceleration @xmath4 is applied in the upward direction .    adapting a polytropic equation of state ( @xmath15 ) , exact equilibrium solutions for a self - gravitating gas exist in the one dimensional , unperturbed , planar problem when @xmath16 = 2/3 , 1 , 2 , and @xmath17 .",
    "a choice of @xmath18 results in a stiffer equation of state than is realistic for the ism , but it admits simple , spatially bounded , analytic expressions for the equilibrium distributions .",
    "previous studies revealed no differences in morphology or growth rate between simulations with @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath18 , the hydrostatic and poisson equations reduce to @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the above , @xmath22 for region 1 and @xmath23 for region 2 , @xmath24^{2 } / 2 p_0 $ ] , and @xmath25 are the self - gravitational accelerations .",
    "the solutions for the densities and accelerations have the forms @xmath26 and @xmath27 the acceleration is continuous across the interface , @xmath28 .",
    "the constant @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 the gravitational scale heights obey the relation @xmath31 defining @xmath13 and @xmath14 as the absolute values of the heights at which the density and pressure go to zero in the corresponding regions , the surface densities are @xmath32~,\\ ] ] and @xmath33~.\\ ] ] using equations ( [ feqn ] ) , ( [ sig2 ] ) , and ( [ sig1 ] ) , it can be verified that gauss theorem is satisfied , @xmath34 by symmetry , @xmath35 , which leads to the expression @xmath36 upon integrating equation ( [ poisson ] ) from @xmath37 to @xmath38 , we find @xmath39 or @xmath40 or @xmath41 recalling that the densities in media 1 and 2 lapse to zero at @xmath42 and @xmath38 , respectively , it follows from equation ( [ rhoeqn ] ) that @xmath43 and @xmath44 hereafter , we define @xmath45 and @xmath46 , both greater than zero . the quadrants in which these angles are defined depends upon the sign of @xmath47 . if @xmath47 is greater than zero , @xmath48 is in the first quadrant and @xmath49 is in the second quadrant . defining @xmath50",
    ", we have the relations @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 and @xmath57 consequently , @xmath58 an identity . the same process can be applied for the case @xmath59 , with similar results .",
    "therefore , the solutions form a consistent set .    in view of these results , we adopt the following strategy .",
    "we set the molecular weight to @xmath60 for both media .",
    "we specify the densities and temperatures at the interface and calculate @xmath12 , @xmath29 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "then , we select @xmath47 and compute the density distributions from equation ( [ rhoeqn ] ) . the pressure and temperatures distributions follow from the equation of state .",
    "the final step is to use equation ( [ feqn ] ) to calculate the boundary values of @xmath25 for use by the gravity solver .    due to discretization of the distributions across the grid",
    ", a truly static state is not achieved .",
    "we deem the setup to be sufficiently static if the motions induced in the unperturbed case are negligible compared to any imposed velocity perturbations .",
    "for example , a typical set of initial values at the interface is : @xmath63 , @xmath64k , @xmath65 , and @xmath66k . the adiabatic sound speed for a temperature of @xmath67 k is @xmath68 .",
    "we typically use @xmath69 of the sound speed ( about @xmath70 ) as the initial perturbation amplitude .",
    "if allowed to run to @xmath71 @xmath72folding times ( @xmath73s ) , the highest velocities observed throughout the grid are less than @xmath74 .",
    "( this represents a conservative case ; most static models show lower velocities . )",
    "this is more than an order of magnitude lower than the initial velocity perturbation amplitude .",
    "deviations from the static solutions are not large enough to affect the results of the perturbed simulations .",
    "as a test of the theory and for understanding the nonlinear behaviour of the instabilities we have carried out two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using cfdlib ( computational fluid dynamics library ) , which was developed at the los alamos national laboratory @xcite .",
    "the system of equations we solve is @xmath75 \\displaystyle{\\frac{\\partial ( \\rho { \\bf v})}{\\partial t } + { \\bf\\nabla}\\cdot { \\cal t } } & = & \\rho ~{\\bf g}~,\\\\[.5 cm ] \\displaystyle {    { \\partial \\over \\partial t } \\left({1\\over 2}\\rho { \\bf v}^2 + \\rho \\varepsilon \\right ) + { \\bf \\nabla}\\cdot \\left[\\left({1\\over 2}\\rho { \\bf v}^2 + \\rho w\\right){\\bf v}\\right ] } & = & 0 ~,\\\\[.5 cm ] \\displaystyle{\\nabla \\cdot { \\bf g } } & = & 4\\pi g \\rho~,\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the stress tensor , @xmath77 is the gravitational acceleration , @xmath78 is the specific energy of the fluid , @xmath79 is the enthalpy , and the equation of state is @xmath80 .",
    "cfdlib is a finite - volume code well suited for problems of all flow speeds .",
    "the self - gravitational potential is solved for in two - dimensions using the mudpack multigrid code developed at the national center for atmospheric research ( adams 1989 , 1991 ) .",
    "models are run on a @xmath81d cartesian mesh of size @xmath82 .",
    "simulations repeated on a @xmath83 grid show a difference in fine scale structure but not in growth rate . the normal velocity components of the gas are confined by reflective boundary conditions on all sides ; whereas , the gravitational potential solver uses periodic boundary conditions along the side boundaries and specified gradient conditions along the top and bottom .    we induce perturbations along the interface through a velocity function of the form @xmath84 with @xmath85 set to @xmath86 of the sound speed in the denser fluid .",
    "the perturbation is localized to the interface due to the exponential factor in the vertical , @xmath87-direction .",
    "we use a velocity perturbation instead of a spatial perturbation for two reasons . while our grid resolution is sufficient to determine growth rates and obtain a sensible picture of nonlinear structure , it is too coarse to impose a spatial perturbation without giving rise to spurious instabilities due to the square cell structure . also , without careful consideration , imposing a perturbation across an interface gives rise to a decaying as well as a growing mode .",
    "the effect of the decaying mode upon the velocity is easily seen and considered in determining growth rates .",
    "for ease of notation , we quote all times in units of the @xmath88-folding time for the incompressible , linear sgi ( @xmath89 ) as determined from equation ( [ rates ] ) , @xmath90s .",
    "we normalize all growth rates by dividing by the corresponding sgi growth rate , @xmath91 .",
    "we define two ratios for each model : @xmath92 for the growth of dense spikes , and @xmath93 for the growth of tenuous bubbles .",
    "we can define an average normalized growth rate @xmath94 ) .",
    "this language is consistent with typical rt descriptions .    for this study",
    ", we define two different classes of models . for the first suite of models , we selected a perturbation wavelength , @xmath95 cm , a value nearly a factor of ten smaller than the jeans length in the denser fluid",
    ". we estimate the acceleration that would give rise to an rt instability with the same growth rate as the sgi , @xmath96 = @xmath97 .",
    "( the factor @xmath98 is a geometric correction to account for the use of a one - dimensional wave vector instead of a two - dimensional wave vector .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is reduced by @xmath98 in going from a @xmath81d to a @xmath99d wavevector , so the value of @xmath4 must increase by @xmath98 to arrive at the correct growth rate . by the same logic , we also adjust our definition of the jeans wavelength in  4.3 to preserve the relationship @xmath100 . )",
    "we compare the rate of perturbation growth for accelerated ( @xmath101 ) interfaces against both the pure sgi ( @xmath102 ) and rt ( @xmath103 , no self - gravity ) cases .",
    "our strategy is to select @xmath47 values that should lead to growth rates equal to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , @xmath81 , and @xmath106 .",
    "we compare the theoretical normalized growth rates @xmath107 to the calculated values @xmath108 .",
    "in addition , we look at models having @xmath109 , in order to ascertain the critical @xmath47 value defining the boundary between stable and unstable behaviour .    we follow with a second set of models designed to investigate the sgi as perturbation wavelengths approach the jeans length .",
    "we remove the rt component ( @xmath110 ) and use a value @xmath111 to allow more compression .",
    "when @xmath102 , the initial distributions in density , temperature , and acceleration can be determined numerically for any value of @xmath16 ( hueckstaedt 2001 ) . at question is whether the sgi can drive a system which is otherwise marginally jeans stable toward global collapse .",
    "in papers 3 and 4 , we compared and contrasted the growth of pure sgi and rt instabilities .",
    "an example of previous results is shown in figure [ sgirt ] .",
    "density contours for sgi and rt models with identical growth rates as determined by equation [ rates ] are plotted for times of @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "as is characteristic of the sgi , the tenuous fingers grow more rapidly than the dense spikes .",
    "all of the models presented in this communication share the same theoretical @xmath72folding time for a pure sgi instability , @xmath90s .",
    "all times are quote in units of @xmath114 .     and the rt instability [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "lines are drawn to represent the linear phase growth , with the slopes determining the growth rates .",
    "[ rtrate ] ]    lines are fit to the velocity points and slopes determined to represent the linear growth rates of both spikes and bubbles .",
    "numerical growth rates for both the rt instability and sgi do not exactly match theoretical values .",
    "rather , the ratio of computational to theoretical growth rate varies with velocity perturbation amplitude and density ratio across the interface ( paper 4 ) .      in order to generalize our study",
    ", we now allow non - zero values for @xmath47 . however , we do so without an imposed constant acceleration ( i.e. no @xmath4 term ) .",
    "so the rt - like contribution to the perturbation growth comes solely from the self - gravitational term at the interface . for @xmath120 ,",
    "an upward acceleration drives the interface in a rt - unstable manner . if @xmath59 , the rt - like component is stabilizing , but since the sgi is always destabilizing , perturbations may still grow if the rt - like term is relatively small .",
    "we investigate the two issues with the set of models summarized in table 1 .",

    "[ jeans2p2 ] ]    the larger cell size results in poorer resolution of the roll - up features .",
    "this is the price paid to be able to examine large scale collapse behaviour without greatly increasing the computational cost .",
    "velocity vectors for model lj2 are shown in figure [ veljeans ] for @xmath127 .    .",
    "[ veljeans ] ]    by placing three waves across the @xmath128 cell extent of the grid , we arrive at model lj3 with @xmath129 ( figure [ jeans2p3 ] ) .     at ( a ) @xmath123 , ( b ) @xmath124 , ( c ) @xmath125 , and ( d ) @xmath126 .",
    "[ jeans2p3 ] ]    as expected , the shorter wavelength of model lj3 results in a growth rate and morphology similar to those for model lj2 .",
    "we observe different behaviour when @xmath130 ( model lj1 ) . for this model",
    ", we extended the computational grid in the @xmath131 direction to @xmath132 cells and maintained the same cell size .",
    "as shown in figure [ jlam ] , the downward motion of the tenuous bubbles ( which outpaces the upward moving spikes in models lj2 and lj3 ) is slower than observed for the other models .",
    "only the central part of the grid is shown in order to maintain a visual scale consistent with the previous figures .     at ( a ) @xmath123 ,",
    "( b ) @xmath124 , ( c ) @xmath125 , and ( d ) @xmath126 .",
    "[ jlam ] ]    . [ veljlam ] ]    velocity vectors for model lj1 are shown in figure [ veljlam ] for @xmath127 .",
    "although the maximum velocities appearing in figures [ veljeans ] and [ veljlam ] are comparable ( about 0.4 km / s ) , model lj1 exhibits a greater degree of collapse as indicated by the converging velocity vectors .",
    "the collapsing nature of model lj1 is highlighted by taking density line - outs through dense columns for all three models at @xmath127 ( figure [ rhocut5 ] ) and @xmath133 ( figure [ rhocut6 ] ) .",
    "for three different wavelengths .",
    "the vertical line indicates the initial location of the interface .",
    "[ rhocut5 ] ]     for three different wavelengths .",
    "[ rhocut6 ] ]    the densest regions in models lj2 and lj3 are found in the dense mushroom caps which move upward over time . in model lj1 , the densest features form near the interface . at @xmath133 ,",
    "the highest compression is seen to have occurred at the stem of the spike rather than in the cap .",
    "we truncate our analysis at @xmath133 due to boundary effects from the top and bottom of the computational grid . also , we consider the cylindrical symmetry of our two - dimensional calculations unrealistic after the onset of ( three - dimensional ) collapse . as an estimate of the minimum collapsing mass",
    ", we note that the mass of a sphere of diameter @xmath134 ( the positive phase of the perturbation for model lj1 ) and uniform density @xmath135 is about @xmath136 .",
    "based upon the work summarized here , we conclude that large scale , planar density discontinuities ( or near discontinuities ) are inherently unstable on a gravitational collapse timescale in two respects : 1 .",
    "any density interface is inherently unstable to the sgi with a growth rate that is scale invariant for incompressible media and nearly scale invariant compressible media .",
    "( in compressible media , some of the energy goes into compression at the expense of driving fluid displacement . ) 2 . in general .",
    "the acceleration due to self - gravity will be non - zero at a density interface . which will add a rayleigh - taylor component to the instability if @xmath137 .",
    "these instabilities cause crenulations along an interface to grow into spikes and bubbles with a growth rate and nonlinear structure that depend upon the relative strength of the sgi and rt - like components . for wavelengths that approach and exceed the jeans length in the denser medium ,",
    "structures initiated by interfacial instabilities are likely to undergo continued gravitational collapse .",
    "an inspection of hubble telescope images of interstellar clouds reveals crenulated interfaces such as the `` elephant trunks '' and `` pillars '' in the eagle nebula ( hester et al .",
    "1996 ; pound 1998 ) .",
    "these structures have commonly been interpreted in terms of the rayleigh - taylor instability of an ionization front created by the uv radiation from nearby ob stars , but without any consideration of the self - gravity of the cloud .",
    "however , recent simulations of the ionization front dynamics indicate that the rayleigh - taylor instability is quenched when hydrogen recombination is included ( mizuta et al . 2005 ) as predicted by kahn ( 1958 ) .",
    "it is clearly of interest to investigate the ionization front stability including self - gravity to see if the sgi instabiliy overcomes the stabilizing effect of recombination . for this",
    "we would need to modify the third line of equation ( 20 ) to include the different energy sources and losses due to the uv absorption , recomination , and radiative cooling .",
    "it is also of interest to extend our work to larger computational grids which will allow us to follow perturbation growth to longer times .",
    "a more ambitious objective is to simulate the sgi in three - dimensions at both short and long wavelengths .",
    "gravitational processes ( both global and interfacial ) clearly have an important role in the evolving ism . for example , burkert and hartmann ( 2004 ) have shown that gravitational forces give rise to a variety of structures along the edges of finite , self - gravitating sheets in a manner consistent with observations of local molecular clouds . in the final stages of star formation , gravitational forces dominate .",
    "but long before the final stages of collapse , gravitational forces are important for driving instabilities which convert gravitational energy into flow kinetic energy , enhance density inhomogeneities , and determine the partitioning of energy between different length scales .",
