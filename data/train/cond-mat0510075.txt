    "understanding the non  equilibrium statistical properties of driven particles in disordered media is a challenging question relevant to many experimental situations .",
    "a prominent example are the moving phases of driven vortex lattices in superconductors @xcite .",
    "a key feature of these systems is that the disorder induces anisotropic response and fluctuations which are strongly controlled by the velocity @xcite .    in spite of its relevance to understand situations of incoherent or plastic vortex flow",
    "the simple case of an isolated vortex driven in a @xmath0-dimensional random potential with @xmath1 has been tackled analitically only by perturbation theory @xcite , valid at high velocities , or by mean field theory @xcite , valid for @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we propose a simple model whose long time behaviour can be computed analitically at @xmath3 for any finite velocity .",
    "let us consider the equation of motion , in two dimensions , of a driven isolated vortex at zero temperature , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the instantaneous velocity of the vortex located at @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the driving force and @xmath8 the friction coefficient .",
    "we model the disorder as a random arrangement of hard disks with center @xmath9 and radius @xmath10 . outside the disks the vortex has a free motion and inside it feels a pinning force , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the amplitude , and @xmath13 the step function .",
    "this disorder models a diluted distribution of pinning centers separated at a distance @xmath14 . in the following we use",
    "adimensionalized variables : @xmath10 is the length unit , @xmath12 the energy unit , and @xmath15 the time unity .    above the depinning transition",
    "the motion of the vortex consists in straight segments of free motion interrupted by the collisions with the different pinning centers . at each collision",
    "the vortex is delayed and deflected with respect to the free motion .",
    "the equation describing the motion of the vortex inside the trap centered at @xmath16 is , @xmath17 the collision starts with the vortex at some initial position @xmath18 on the border of the trap , @xmath19 .",
    "the solution of eq.([eq : eqcol ] ) is @xmath20 after a time interval @xmath21 the vortex will exit from the trap , therefore @xmath22 . using this condition in equation [ eq : soltrap ]",
    "we obtain the following expression for @xmath21 , @xmath23 ^ 2- ( f^2 - 1)({\\bf f}_p^0)^2}}{({\\bf f}_p^0)^2 }   \\label{eq : expdt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 .",
    "the displacement @xmath25 induced by the collision is then given by , @xmath26 due to the random distribution of pinning centers , the motion can be considered as a random walk in the long time limit .",
    "the fluctuations of @xmath27 are thus induced by the uncorrelated sequence of collisions .",
    "assuming identical pinning centers , the randomness comes exclusively from the random initial conditions of each collision , described by eq.([eq : soltrap ] ) .    in a long time interval",
    "@xmath28 the vortex collides with a large number @xmath29 of pinning centers . since the core covers an area @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mean velocity , we get , @xmath32 by symmetry , the long time displacement is along the direction of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes an average over a random distribution of initial conditions @xmath37 in equations [ eq : expdt ] and [ eq : dxi ] . from eq .",

    "we get , @xmath46 to define the transverse mobility we need to introduce a small perturbative force @xmath47 .",

    "we get , @xmath50 finally we can define effective temperatures using generalized einstein relations , @xmath51 in order to calculate the transport properties defined above ( @xmath31 , @xmath40 , @xmath39 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ) we need to calculate the first moments of the distribution of @xmath21 , @xmath56 , @xmath25 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 by performing simple integrals .",

    "grow linearly with @xmath31 while at large velocity @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "let us note that @xmath39 and @xmath40 cross at a characteristic velocity @xmath70 .",
    "this crossing means that the long time diffusion front changes aspect ratio at @xmath70 . for @xmath71 the diffusion front",
    "is elongated in the driven direction , while for @xmath71 is elongated in the transverse direction . at @xmath70 diffusion is isotropic .",
    "interestingly , the same behavior is observed in numerical simulations of interacting vortices in two dimensions @xcite .    in fig . [",
    "fig : difyres](b ) we show the longitudinal and transverse mobilities .",
    "we observe that both are velocity dependent and approach the free flux response , @xmath72 , at large velocities .",
    "since the @xmath53 is the differential resistance , @xmath73 , the divergence observed at small velocity is a signature of the depinning transition .",
    "@xmath53 near depinning is high since any small force can reduce strongly the waiting time @xmath74 inside the trap . on the contrary , @xmath75 at small velocity .",
    "a small transverse force has a small effect in the trap time @xmath21 compared with the linear @xmath31 dependence ( eq.([eq : nrocollisions ] ) ) of the number of collisions per unit time .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : teff ] we show the effective temperatures in the longitudinal and transverse directions .",
    "since at large velocities the mobilities saturate , the velocity dependence of the effective temperatures are dominated by the diffusion constants , and thus @xmath76 and @xmath77 . at low velocities the effective temperatures are instead strongly determined by the velocity dependence of the mobilities .",
    "@xmath78 reaches a maximum at a intermediate velocity and decreases quickly to zero with decreasing @xmath31 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath79 saturates at a finite value as the velocity vanishes , due to the linear dependence with velocity of both the diffusion constant and the mobility .",
    "it is worth noting that only at large velocities and in the transverse direction , the effective temperature is found to be identical , except from numerical factors , to the shaking temperature @xcite .",
    "this confirms that the shaking temperature is equivalent to an effective temperature defined from a generalized fluctuation relation only in the limit of large velocity of non  interacting vortices @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out here that the thermodynamic nature of the effective temperatures of this model is still unclear , since the system is non  interacting and strongly driven @xcite .",
    "we have studied the pinning  induced anisotropic diffusion of driven non  interacting vortices .",
    "we find that the diffusion front is elongated in the direction of the driving force at low velocities and in the transverse direction at large velocities .",
    "this implies the existence of isotropic diffusion at a characteristic velocity @xmath70 .",
    "the analysis of the anisotropic low frequency voltage noise in superconductors could be a possible experimental probe of this result , since diffusion constants and velocity fluctuations are related by generalized green - kubo relations @xcite .    even if the depinning transition does depend on the peculiarities of our model , we find that the main features of the long time fluctuations we obtain at intermediate and large velocities are in agreement with perturbation theory predictions @xcite and with numerical simulations of non interacting vortices for the non  simplified model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to show that our model can be solved at any dimension @xmath1 and generalized to more complicated short - range random potentials @xcite .",
