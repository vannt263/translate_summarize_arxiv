    "evidence for neutrino flavor oscillations have been mounting over the years .",
    "a variety of solar neutrino experiments @xcite which have consistently detected fewer @xmath14 s from the sun than expected now seem to converge on the large angle msw solution as the preferred explanation for the discrepancy @xcite .",
    "the deficit in the flux of atmospheric muon neutrinos @xcite and especially the observed zenith angle dependence are compelling evidences in favor of @xmath15 oscillations .",
    "the lsnd collaboration observes an anomaly in the flux of @xmath16 detected @xcite , which can be interpreted as evidence for @xmath6 oscillations .    as it turns out , it is not possible to explain all of these observations in terms of neutrino oscillations with just three flavors of neutrinos ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the reason is that the characteristic oscillation length scales inferred from the three types of experiments are quite different having no overlap : @xmath19 and @xmath20 m. the oscillation length is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 etc , with @xmath23 being the mass of the @xmath24th neutrino mass eigenstate , and where @xmath25 denotes the neutrino energy . in three neutrino oscillation schemes",
    "there are only two independent mass  splittings , which therefore excludes a simultaneous explanation of all three observations .",
    "two approaches have been adopted in the literature to address this conundrum . in the first ,",
    "one of the three observations is simply discarded . in the second approach , a fourth `` sterile '' neutrino ( @xmath26 )  sterile so that it does not affect the number of neutrinos that couples to the @xmath10 bososn  is introduced . both of these approaches are not very satisfactory .",
    "the first one is clearly without justification .",
    "the second , introduction of a sterile neutrino , has some serious theoretical difficulties , in addition to a possible problem with the standard big bang nucleosynthesis . its lightness can not be explained in any simple way , unlike that of the `` active '' neutrino which follows very naturally from the seesaw mechanism @xcite . even taking a light sterile neutrino for granted ,",
    "some potential experimental difficulties have emerged over the last year . when the recent sno results on solar neutrinos are combined with the results of superkamiokande ,",
    "the allowed parameter space is tightly constrained for oscillations involving a sterile neutrino . in fact , a two  flavor @xmath27 oscillation scenario no longer provides a good fit to the solar neutrino data .",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillation results from superkamiokande also disfavor oscillations of @xmath28 with a @xmath26 .",
    "somewhat more involved four neutrino oscillation schemes would be necessary , conforming to either a ( 3 + 1 ) @xcite scheme or a mixed 2 + 2 scheme @xcite .",
    "although both appear to be viable presently , neither gives a really satisfactory global fit to all the data @xcite .",
    "there is also a proposal to account for the lsnd results in the three neutrino framework by invoking cpt violation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide a simultaneous solution to the three neutrino anomalies without introducing a sterile neutrino .",
    "it will be achieved by small non ",
    "standard interactions of the leptons instead .",
    "since the flavor conversion probabilities are of order unity for both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino experiments , we shall focus on non  standard lepton interactions explaining the lsnd anomaly , which calls for a smaller probability : @xmath29 @xcite . specifically",
    ", we shall show that lepton number violating @xmath30 muon decays can account for the lsnd events .",
    "the new decay mode of the muon is @xmath31 where @xmath32 stands for any one of @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "consistent gauge models will be presented where such decays occur with the desired strength .",
    "it is crucial that the non  standard decays of the muon are lepton number violating @xcite .",
    "attempts to explain the lsnd data in terms of lepton number conserving four  fermion interaction @xcite will lead to inconsistencies with other experiments .",
    "one can make an @xmath35 transformation on such effective operators which would invariably generate lepton number violating processes such as @xmath36 decay , muonium  antimuonium transition , @xmath37 decay , etc , which are highly constrained by experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath38 processes that we find will not admit an @xmath35 transformation to generate one of these highly forbidden processes , primarily because there is no charged current counterpart to the anomalous muon decays . since the new physics affects only @xmath39 decays , and not that of @xmath5 , our interpretation of the lsnd results would predict that no oscillation signal should be seen at the fermilab mini  boone experiment .",
    "we have identified two @xmath38 effective operators which are invariant under the standard model symmetries that can induce the decay of eq .",
    "( 1 ) without generating any other effects .",
    "these effective operators can be realized from underlying renormalizable theories which are extensions of the standard model involving additional scalar multiplets .",
    "the masses of these scalar bosons are bounded by about 500 gev , in order that the signal at lsnd is significant .",
    "since the scale of new physics , @xmath3 , is relatively low , the particles at the scale @xmath3 do not decouple entirely and have an impact on low energy observables .",
    "we highlight the processes that would succumb to the new physics most easily .",
    "they include small but observable deviations in @xmath7 and @xmath8 cross sections , observable corrections to the muon @xmath9 , and lepton number violating @xmath10 decays with branching ratios of order @xmath11 .",
    "the decay @xmath40 with @xmath41 or @xmath2 , if allowed by the theory , can explain the lsnd neutrino anomaly .",
    "recall that the usual @xmath42 decay @xmath43 has no @xmath16 which the lsnd detector registers .",
    "the new decay of @xmath44 produces @xmath16 , which will then be detected . the branching ratio for the new decay should be about @xmath45 , as can be inferred from the lsnd analysis of the @xmath6 oscillation probability .",
    "we have found two effective operators invariant under the symmetries of the standard model @xcite that can induce the desired @xmath38 muon decays .",
    "they are @xmath46 here @xmath47 , @xmath48 , etc denote the left  handed lepton doublets , while @xmath49 denote the right  handed singlets .",
    "@xmath50 is the standard model higgs doublet with its hypercharge normalized to be @xmath51 .",
    "note that both @xmath52 and @xmath53 are non  renormalizable operators of dimension 9 , and hence are suppressed by fifth power of @xmath3 which characterizes the scale of new physics .",
    "as we shall see , these operators will arise from integrating out scalar fields which have lepton number violating interactions .",
    "operator @xmath54 has a unique @xmath35 contraction , owing to bose symmetry in the @xmath50 field .",
    "although @xmath55 in @xmath54 contracts to form an @xmath35 singlet , it will not induce a @xmath56 mass term ( see below ) .",
    "similarly , no @xmath57 neutrino mass term will arise from these operators .",
    "note also that there is a unique lorentz contraction of fermionic fields in @xmath54 , if we limit ourselves to obtaining these operators by integrating out scalar fields .",
    "similar remarks apply to operator @xmath58 as well . in this case",
    ", there is a minor variant , obtained by contracting @xmath59 rather than @xmath60 , which is somewhat different for the case when @xmath61 .    when the vacuum expectation value @xmath62 is inserted in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , it would generate the four  fermion operators @xmath63 these operators will lead to the decay @xmath64 .",
    "the branching ratio for the @xmath65violating @xmath44 decay is given by @xmath66 ^ 2~.\\ ] ] inserting the numerical value of @xmath67 gev , and demanding that the branching ratio for this decay is in the range @xmath68 , we find that the scale @xmath69 gev . since @xmath3 is not very large , the particles that have masses of order @xmath3 will not entirely decouple and will affect low energy observables .",
    "an important point about operators @xmath54 and @xmath58 of eq .",
    "( 2 ) is that they induce only the terms given in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and nothing more .",
    "this is because of the @xmath70 nature of these operators and the fact that there is only one higgs scalar in the theory .",
    "this proves that the effective operators of eq .",
    "( 2 ) generate the desired interactions that can explain the lsnd events , and nothing else .",
    "unlike in the case of @xmath71 muon decays , there is no conflict with processes such as @xmath72 , @xmath73 , etc",
    ".    karmen experiment @xcite has set severe limits on lepton number violating decays of the muon .",
    "these limits however , depend sensitively on the assumed decay distribution .",
    "the anomalous muon decay arising from eq .",
    "( 2 ) in our models has a different distribution compared to that of the usual ( v - a ) decay of the muon .",
    "we find that operators @xmath54 and @xmath58 lead to the prediction @xmath74 for the michel parameter for the @xmath38 decay .",
    "( the other decay asymmetry parameters for the @xmath65violating @xmath42 decay are found to be : @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite . )",
    "the limit from karmen for the branching ratio for the decay @xmath77 corresponding to the case where @xmath74 is br @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "this limit is somewhat weaker than karmen s published limit corresponding to the case of @xmath79 @xcite .",
    "thus , the karmen results appear to be just about consistent with lsnd observations , in our interpretation of the data . a joint analysis of the lsnd and the karmen data in our framework will be desirable .",
    "all new phenomena in the model will arise from particles with masses of order @xmath3 . to see these additional new effects",
    ", we have to generate operators of eq .",
    "( 2 ) from renormalizable lagrangian densities .",
    "we now turn to this task .",
    "we shall now present renormalizable gauge models that induce the effective operators of eq . ( 2 ) .",
    "these models are obtained by extending the scalar sector of the standard model .",
    "the new interaction lagrangian for the first model which induces @xmath54 is given by @xmath80 here @xmath81 and @xmath82 are scalar fields ( their @xmath83 quantum numbers are as indicated ) which do not acquire any vacuum expectation value .",
    "figure 1 will induce the effective operator @xmath54 from eq .",
    "notice that the intermediate scalar particles are electrically neutral , so the anomalous muon decay is a neutral current process .",
    "it is not possible to make an @xmath35 transformation in fig . 1 to convert some of the external fermions , without also transforming the external higgs field to its charged component , which of course is unphysical .",
    "= 2.0 in    the strength of the effective four  fermion coupling arising from fig . 1 , in the approximation of small scalar mixing , is @xmath84 if all the mass parameters are equal and if @xmath85 and @xmath86 are equal to one , lsnd data would require the scalar masses to be in the range @xmath87 gev . actually , we can make this statement more precise .",
    "let us denote the scalar mass  squared matrix involving the mixing of @xmath88 to be @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath90 be the unitary matrix that diagonalizes @xmath89 : @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "then by making use of the unitarity of @xmath90 and the fact that @xmath93 , we can write down the branching ratio to be @xmath94 noting that @xmath95 , and demanding that @xmath96 is in the range @xmath97 , we obtain an upper limit on the lightest neutral scalar mass @xmath98 : @xmath99 gev .",
    "if @xmath100 is less than @xmath101 , @xmath98 will have to be even lighter .",
    "the heavier masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 can not be very much larger , or else the mixing angle @xmath100 will be suppressed .",
    "we estimate @xmath104 to be not larger than @xmath98 by about a factor of 2 .",
    "while these limits hold for the neutral scalars , their charged partners should also have comparable masses .",
    "any splitting between the masses of the neutral and charged scalars will be @xmath35breaking , and is limited by the electroweak @xmath105 parameter .",
    "@xmath106 in eq .",

    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "a @xmath112 subgroup of electron number is also preserved .",
    "it is not required that these symmetries be broken , so they may be used to prevent rare processes at undesirable rates .    if @xmath113 in eq . ( 5 ) , then muon and tau lepton numbers are unbroken . also unbroken is a @xmath114 subgroup of electron number . if @xmath115 , then @xmath116 and @xmath117 are unbroken , as is @xmath114 subgroup of @xmath118 .",
    "these symmetries guarantee that potentially dangerous lepton number violating processes remain small .    the scalar fields @xmath119 and @xmath120 carry lepton number symmetries ( or a discrete subgroup of these symmetries ) , so that they do not acquire vevs .",
    "this can be ascertained by choosing the mass  squared of these scalars to be positive .",
    "the lepton number symmetries will forbid possible tadpole contributions to their vevs .",
    "thus , these new interactions do not induce neutrino masses at all .",
    "the only source of neutrino mass in these models is through the seesaw mechanism .",
    "one may worry about the compatibility of the lepton number symmetries present in eq .",
    "( 5 ) and the neutrino oscillation data , which calls for the breaking of all such symmetries .",
    "we shall present a concrete example to demonstrate the consistency .",

    "currently the uncertainty in the measurement of @xmath105 is @xmath135 , but the twist experiment at triumf @xcite will have a sensitivity of @xmath136 in @xmath105 , which can test this scenario .",
    "there will also be a small shift in @xmath137 extracted from @xmath42 decay by @xmath138% , compared to the standard model value .",
    "such a shift is currently consistent with radiative corrections in muon decay ( parametrized by @xmath139 ) , which has an uncertainty of about @xmath140% arising from the @xmath141 gev uncertainty in the top quark mass alone .",
