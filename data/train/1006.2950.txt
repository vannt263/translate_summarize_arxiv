    "magnetars are a small class of isolated x - ray pulsars , believed to have the highest magnetic fields known to date ( @xmath0@xmath12@xmath13 g ; @xcite ) .",
    "this class comprises the anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and the soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgrs ) , observationally very similar in many respects ( see @xcite for a recent review ) : a spin period in the 212s range , large period derivatives ( @xmath14@xmath15  ) , unpredictable bursting activity on different timescales ( from ms to hundreds of seconds ) and luminosities ( @xmath16@xmath17 ) . until not long ago axps were thought as persistent and stable x - ray sources . only in 2003",
    "the first transient axp was discovered by , namely , which displayed a factor of @xmath4100 flux enhancement with respect to the pre - outburst luminosity level as seen by the _ rosat _ and _ einstein _ missions ( @xmath0@xmath18 ; @xcite ) .",
    "even more surprising was the discovery of a highly variable pulsed radio emission which followed the  outburst @xcite , never observed before in any other magnetar @xcite .",
    "moreover , the transient nature of this axp provided the first hint that a relatively large number of members of this class has not been discovered yet , and suggested that others would manifest themselves in the future through a phenomenology ( outburst ) similar to that displayed by .",
    "indeed , after this first discovery , two more transient axps have been detected showing similar outbursts , , @xcite and .",
    "the latter axp was first suggested as a candidate magnetar in the supernova remnant g327.240.13 through x - ray observations @xcite , and subsequently recognized as a radio transient magnetar through the discovery of radio pulsations @xcite at a period of @xmath02.1s , and of an x - ray outburst @xcite . in particular",
    ", /x - ray telescope ( xrt ) observations taken in summer 2007 revealed  at an x - ray flux level of @xmath0@xmath19 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 ( more than one order of magnitude brighter than in quiescence ) , with characteristics similar to those of  in outburst .",
    "no x - ray bursts were observed during the 2007 outburst of , possibly due to a sparse x - ray coverage .",
    "more generally , the first phases of the 2003 and 2007 x - ray outbursts from  and , respectively , were missed .",
    "relatively deep  pointings were obtained in august 2006 and 2007 , the first during quiescence , and the second during the outburst decay .",
    "pulsed fractions of about @xmath015% and @xmath07% were inferred for the 2006 and 2007 observations , respectively @xcite . the 2006 quiescent spectrum ( @xmath0@xmath20 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 in the 110 kev range ) can be fitted well with the usual thermal ( blackbody ) plus non - thermal ( power - law ) model ( @xmath21 kev and @xmath22 ; @xcite ) , with a 1d resonant cyclotron scattering model ( with a surface temperature @xmath23=0.33 kev , an electron velocity @xmath24=0.32 and an optical depth @xmath25=1.0 ; @xcite ) , or with 3d monte carlo model ( with a surface temperature of @xmath23=0.33 kev , an electron bulk velocity of @xmath26=0.15 , and a twist angle of @xmath27=1.14 ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , the 2007 spectrum ( @xmath0@xmath28 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 in the 110 kev range ) is characterized by a harder emission with @xmath29 kev and @xmath30 ( by using the bb plus pl model ) .",

    "recently , during the giant outburst detected from  on 2009 january 22 , a relatively bright transient ir source ( @xmath31 mag ) was discovered within the radio positional uncertainty region of the source @xcite .    within the magnetar scenario ,",
    "axp outbursts are thought to be caused by large scale rearrangements of the external magnetic field , either accompanied or triggered by fracturing of the neutron - star crust .",
    "these events may result in renewed magnetospheric activity through the interaction between thermal surface photons and charges flowing along the ( closed ) field lines .",
    "in addition , hot spots on the neutron - star surface may appear where the currents impact on the star .",
    "repeated resonant cyclotron scatterings onto the magnetospheric particles result in a modification of the seed thermal spectrum with the appearance of a non - thermal , high - energy tail @xcite .    during the first month since the onset of an outburst , the source experience a large flux variations ( approximately by one or two orders of magnitudes ) . in this respect ,",
    "monitoring campaigns , obtained just after the outburst onset , are giving an important opportunity to track the evolution of the main physical parameters and , therefore , to check the goodness of the ( empirical and/or more physical ) components used to model the spectra .",
    "here we report on the discovery of bursting activity and a new outburst from , as observed by  (  [ swift ] ) , which was promptly triggered by the onset of the bursting activity of this transient axp on 2008 october 3 .",
    "the  monitoring of the source in the 100s22days time interval allowed us to carry out a detailed timing and spectral study , the first ever for this source , of the initial phases of its outburst on a daily basis .",
    "we also report on the results of an  target of opportunity observation performed during the x - ray outburst (  [ integral ] ) , and discuss our findings in comparison with other magnetar outbursts (  [ disc ] ) .",
    "the  satellite @xcite is an efficient observatory for the discovery and the multiwavelength monitoring of axp bursting activity .",
    "whenever the wide - field coded - aperture mask burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xcite ) triggers on a burst from an interesting hard x - ray transient , the system on - board can rapidly re - point the satellite in order to bring the source in the narrower field of view of the other two telescopes on - board , the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xcite ) and the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we present the results obtained from our analysis of the  bat and xrt observations of axp  performed during its bursting activity on 2008 october , being the source too absorbed to be detected with the uvot .",
    "on 2008 october 3 at 09:28:08 ut bat triggered on and localized a short burst from a position consistent with that of the axp  ( trigger 330353 ; @xcite ) which was followed by several other bursts extending to at least 09:38:24 ut .",

    "we decided not to use a pulse template in the cross - correlation ( which might artificially affect the phase shift ) , but to fit each individual folded light curve with the fundamental plus two higher harmonics . in the following we also implicitly assumed that the pulsation period ( and its derivatives ) is a reliable estimate of the spin period ( and its derivatives ) , an assumption which is usually considered correct for isolated neutron stars . the resulting best - fit period ( @xmath64=1.1 for 2 degree of freedom , hereafter d.o.f . )",

    "variability of only 0.08 s , corresponding to a timing noise level of about 3% , usually observed in isolated neutron stars .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the second period derivative we found is very unlike to be related to a random change of the pulse profiles which is expected to introduce only a random distribution of the phase residuals , rather then a cubic term .",
    "recent studies on a sample of 366 radio pulsars showed that cubic terms on phase residuals are possible though smaller by several orders of magnitudes than that detected in  and recorded on time - scales longer ( years ) than those we are sampling in our dataset @xcite .",
    "more in general the ( long - term ) timing noise of young radio pulsars ( @xmath98yr ) can be explained as being caused by the recovery from previous glitch events @xcite .",
    "the latter results make unlike that the period second derivative is due to random noise .",
    "finally , we note that in the above analysis we assumed that the emitting region is fixed in time with respect to the observer , as suggested by studies on other transient magnetars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , we can also reasonably exclude that the cubic term is introduced by a random motion of the hot - spot .",

    "the pulse shape is variable too , from a multi - peak profile at the beginning of the outburst , to a less structured sinusoid during the latest xrt observations , though the lower statistics of the latter datasets might have hidden a more complex behavior . to assess the significance of the observed pulse shape variations as a function of time , we compared the folded pairs of contiguous lightcurves reported in figure[figure : efold ] by using a two - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite .",

    "spectral modelling was performed by fitting together all the datasets in the 110 kev energy range ( the high absorption value made the data below 1.5 kev almost useless ) .",
    "we first fit the spectra to simple models : a power law and a blackbody , both modified for interstellar absorption .",

    "the results are shown in figure[spec ] and can be summarized as follows : ( a ) the first spectrum ( 99s after the bat trigger ) can be totally ascribed to a hard power - law ( @xmath108 , 90% c.l . ) , ( b ) during the second and the third observations ( between 0.05 and 0.2 days after the trigger ) the bb component becomes dominant ( @xmath109 kev in both cases ) , though a pl component is still needed ( but not statistically significant ) above 46 kev , ( c ) after one day since the bat trigger ( fourth observation ) the pl component is not any more detectable in the bb+pl model , while in the single pl model the photon index becomes @xmath44 ( mimicking a wien tail of a bb component ) . given the relatively low number of counts we did not attempt to fit more sophisticated and physical based models .",

    "thanks to the  capability of detecting high energy impulsive events with the bat , and of rapidly pointing to the bat position with the narrow field instrument xrt , we had the chance of studying the short burst and long - term outbursting properties of one of the most interesting objects of the magnetar class , , which entered a renewed phase of activity on 2008 october 3 . in particular , given the relatively large period derivative of the source @xcite , we set up an observational strategy so that daily pointings were performed during a three week baseline ( during which the source was observable by ) .",
    "we studied the pulsed emission and inferred a rather accurate phase - connected timing solution which also includes a second derivative component .",

    "in fact , the 15150kev fluence of the bursts reported in table[table_bat_spec_fit ] is in the @xmath115ergs range ( inferred for a distance of 4kpc ; @xcite ) .",

    "the upper limit on the persistent emission of the source , as seen by xrt , is of the order of @xmath11610@xmath38ergs ( by integrating the exponential flux decay law from the beginning of october 2008 to mid - january 2009 ; see also first panel of figure[spec_evol ] ) , corresponding to a ratio between energy released in the bursts and in the persistent tail @xmath42 .",
    "the latter value is in between those observed for sgrs , i.e. @xmath410 , and those of axps where the typical ratio is of the order of unity or less .",
    "the x - ray timing properties of  in october 2008 are such that a strong second derivative component , beside the usual @xmath5 and @xmath6 ones , is needed in order to account for the evolution of the pulse phases during the about three weeks covered by  observations .",
    "the latter component is @xmath92 s s@xmath93 or @xmath97 hz s@xmath93 , therefore with the same sign as that of the first derivative .",
    "second period derivatives have been detected only for a few axps / sgrs and , in all cases , occurred in response to glitches , such as in the case of  @xcite and @xcite , and/or outbursts ,  @xcite and @xcite . in nearly all cases",
    "the second derivatives were relatively small , while the sign of these components was such that it acts in decelerating the spin down rates ; typical @xmath117 values are approximately in the 0.05@xmath655 @xmath3710@xmath118hzs@xmath93 range . only for one axp ,",
    "namely , negative second period derivatives in the 0.01@xmath651.3 @xmath3710@xmath119hzs@xmath93 range has been detected just after a glitch @xcite .",
    "the timing properties of  were already known to be unusual during the first 6 months of radio monitoring ( june ",
    "november 2007 ; @xcite ) . even in that case",
    ", observations were taken after a period of activity and also at that time both the first and second frequency derivatives were negative : @xmath120 hz s@xmath3 and @xmath121 hz s@xmath93 .",
    "moreover , during the same time span in which the @xmath122 ( and torque ) increased , the x  ray flux decreased , a property which is difficult to account for with simple assumptions . according to @xcite , a possibility is that an extra torque ( either than the magnetic spin down ) originated from a particle wind that twists the magnetic field and , at the same time , transfers some angular momentum . in any case ,",
    "the observed phenomenology calls for a mechanism in which x - ray luminosity and spin - down rate are not caused by the same mechanism or , at least , not by the same mechanism and also at the same time .",
    "even more dramatic is the case of october 2008 reported in this paper , with  showing a @xmath117 which is a factor of about 50 larger than in 2007 , while the x  ray flux is a factor of 430 higher than during 2007 .",
    "it is very likely that the @xmath117 components related with glitch - only events have a different origin than those related to outburst events .",
    "for another transient axp , , a @xmath117 component has been detected during an outburst , although after two years since the onset @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , a straightforward comparison with the  properties is not feasible ( similar arguments also hold for the radio properties of the two sources ) . in the case of ,",
    "the second derivative component was inferred during the first two months since the outburst onset and has a sign opposite to that of .",
    "a plausible scenario is that the dissimilar behavior seen in the various sources is related to the difference between the outburst @xmath123 and the pulsar secular one @xmath124 .",
    "regardless of the mechanism responsible for the outburst and for the net timing effects at the outburst onset , it is reasonable to imagine the pulsar as a system which tends to recover its ( almost ) initial timing properties , i.e. same pre - outburst and post - outburst @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , a negative or positive second period derivatives might be ascribed to whether the @xmath123 over @xmath124 ratio is larger or smaller than unity .",
    "unfortunately , for all the four magnetars for which an outburst was detected in the latest few years ( , ,  and ) the @xmath124 is unknown . in the case of  the positive second derivative detected in 2007 and 2008",
    "would imply a @xmath123 smaller than @xmath124 : the latter being the value to which the source is approaching asymptotically . within the classical scenario of isolated neutron stars ,",
    "@xmath124 is the spin - down value to be used when inferring the pulsar dipolar magnetic field strength .",
    "correspondingly , the inferred value of @xmath125 gauss should be considered as a lower limit on the intrinsic dipolar magnetic field strength .",
    "taken at face values , the increase of @xmath126 during the outburst decay appears difficult to reconcile with the predictions of the twisted magnetosphere model . in such model ,",
    "in fact , the spin - down rate is dictated by the radial variation of the external field .",
    "a globally twisted dipolar field has radial dependence @xmath127 , where the index @xmath128 decreases with increasing twist angle ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "if , as it seems natural to assume , the twist decays as the source returns to quiescence , one expects a decrease in the spin - down rate , i.e. a negative @xmath130 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , however , in realistic situations the twist is likely to be confined to a rather narrow bundle of current - carrying field lines . in this case , and if the twist is suddenly implanted but its strength is moderate ( twist angle less than @xmath01 rad ) , the twist may still grow for a while in spite of the luminosity released by dissipation monotonically decreasing . only after the twist angle has reached its maximum value",
    ", it will start to decrease , together with the torque .",
    "this implies that the spin - down rate may be non - monotonic during the outburst decay , with a first phase characterized by a positive @xmath130 followed by a `` recovery '' during which @xmath131 and @xmath126 goes back to its secular value .",
    "the typical duration of the increasing spin - down stage is difficult to quantify , but it can last @xmath0 months ( see eq .  55 in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , this effect has been already proposed by @xcite to explain the anti - correlation between x - ray luminosity and torque observed in 1e1048.1 - 5937 @xcite . in   @xmath126",
    "has been observed to increase monotonically during summer / fall 2007 ( during the decay of an outburst the peak of which has been missed ; * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath132 corresponding to the latest radio observation of @xcite is @xmath133 , and that in october 3 , at the beginning of the x  ray outburst , @xmath134 s@xmath93 .",
    "a continuous decrease in @xmath132 seems therefore hardly compatible with observations , and , since a constant @xmath132 has never been observed in axps , it may well be that @xmath132 started increasing at some epoch between 2007 november 22 ( latest radio observations ) and 2008 october 3 ( x - ray outburst onset )",
    ". this behavior would not be in contradiction with the untwisting magnetosphere model mentioned above .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning the possibility that the unusual @xmath126 behaviour after the october 2008 outburst might be one of the reasons for the extremely intense outburst displayed by  in january 2009 . in other words , the positive @xmath130 would be acted in accelerating the onset of stresses on the ns surface .",
    "the pulsed fraction of  clearly increases during october 2008 , a behavior already observed during the initial phases of axp outbursts , such as the case of  where the quiescent pulsed fraction ( @xmath080% ) dropped to @xmath010% at the outburst onset and started increasing thereafter towards the quiescent value ( @xcite ; similar results have been recently obtained for ; @xcite ) . however , in the case of  the pulsed fraction at the outburst onset ( @xmath020% ) is already larger than the quiescent value ( as seen by ; @xmath07% ) and it reached @xmath050% at the end of the october 2008  monitoring window .",
    "this finding , together with the very variable pulse profile as a function of time , suggests that the emission and/or magnetospheric geometry is complex and variable during the initial phases ( on month timescales ) of the outburst , and likely not easily related to the geometry in quiescence .",
    "pulsations in the x - ray flux may be a consequence of emission from a limited area of the star surface , of non - isotropic magnetospheric emission , or a combination of both effects .",
    "again , if the star surface is heated by the returning currents which appear when a magnetospheric twist is implanted , even considering the simple evolution of the twist dictated by ohmic dissipation , an increase of the pulsed fraction in time is expected because , as time elapses , the bundle of current - carrying field lines shrinks and the heated area decreases . on the other hand ,",
    "an increase in both pulsed fraction and emitting area , which is not excluded by the present data , would point toward a complete disassociation between the hot spot and the timing properties , with the latter perhaps of magnetospheric origin .",
    "the xrt statistics is not enough to unambiguously assess the evolution of the emitting area , nor even the presence of two distinct spectral components ( bb and pl ) detected by   in 2006 and 2007 , although there are several hints suggesting that also in the spectra observed during october 2008 two components are needed .",
    "overall , the spectral properties of  are also very similar to those of other transient magnetars , with an evident decay of the flux and a softening of the emitted photons ( at least in the 110 kev range ) as the outburst evolves in time .",
    "the spectral softening is apparent while using both the bb and the pl spectral models .",
    "referring , for concreteness , to the power - law model , the photon index switches from @xmath135 at the outburst onset to @xmath136 after @xmath137 d. a softening is expected if the spectrum originates in a globally twisted magnetosphere by resonant up - scattering .",
    "as the twist angle decreases the charge density decreases making scattering less efficient .",
    "this implies that the high - energy tail filled up by up - scattered thermal photons becomes less and less populated , producing a softening of the spectrum .",
    "this has been verified by detailed monte carlo simulations in the case of a globally twisted dipolar field ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although no detailed model has been presented as yet , it seems likely that the same picture holds if a localized twist is considered instead .",
    "as it was mentioned earlier , the twist angle may still increase for a while following the onset of the outburst , which would be consistent with the negative @xmath7 , while its spatial extent decreases @xcite .",
    "this latter effect may compensate for the first one and be the main effect responsible for the spectral evolution : in particular , if the region in which photons can be efficiently scattered by the currents is reduced , a flux softening and decrease in luminosity are expected .",
