    "ngc4258 ( m106 ) is a weakly active seyfert 1 ( filippenko 1996 ) galaxy at a distance of 7 mpc ( we adopt h@xmath9=65 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 ; at this distance 1@xmath1=33.9 pc ) .",
    "the nucleus of the galaxy is a prototypical low luminosity agn .",
    "dynamical evidence for the existence of a massive black hole in the nucleus comes from high spatial resolution vlbi observations of water masers , which reveal the existence of a thin edge - on disk of inner radius 4 milliarcseconds and outer radius 8 milliarcseconds ( miyoshi et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the high velocity features of the masers were found to be symmetrically offset from the systemic velocity by 700@xmath61000   as would be expected in a keplerian disk .",
    "the inferred binding mass of 3.5@xmath110.1@xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 within a radius of 0.14 pc ( herrnstein , greenhill , & moran 1996 ) makes it the strongest supermassive black hole candidate after the nucleus of the galaxy ( genzel et al .",
    "1997 , ghez et al .",
    "the adopted binding mass and distance for the galaxy are consistent with the more recent measurements of herrnstein et al .",
    "observations by the x - ray satellite asca indicate the existence of a strongly obscured source with a photon index of @xmath12=1.8@xmath110.3 at the nucleus of the galaxy ( makishima et al .",
    "the photon index @xmath12=1+@xmath13 where @xmath13 is the spectral index .",
    "the line of sight column density of n@xmath14=1.5@xmath210@xmath15 @xmath16 derived from a fit to the absorbed x - ray data , corresponds to a@xmath1780 mags which would obscure the nucleus at visible wavelengths .",
    "the extinction - corrected x - ray luminosity from 2@xmath610 kev is 4@xmath210@xmath18  ergs  s@xmath10 and is relatively insensitive to the absorption column density .",
    "based on arguments that the x - ray luminosity is typically about 5% to 40% of the bolometric luminosity in agn ( mushotzky , done , & pounds 1993 ) , l@xmath19 for the central engine in ngc4258 is of order 10@xmath20  ergs  s@xmath10 .",
    "this is 2@xmath210@xmath21  l@xmath22 , where l@xmath22 is the eddington luminosity of the massive black hole at the nucleus and corresponds to 4.4@xmath210@xmath23  ergs  s@xmath10 .",
    "the low bolometric luminosity of the central engine can be explained by an incorrect estimation of l@xmath19 since the overall spectral energy distribution of the central engine is not well known .",
    "alternatively , since l@xmath19=@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the radiative efficiency and @xmath26 is the mass accretion rate of the central engine , a low bolometric luminosity could be attributed to : + 1 . a sub - eddington mass accretion rate through a standard , geometrically thin disk .",
    "for the black hole in ngc4258 , the eddington mass accretion rate @xmath270.75 m@xmath4/yr where @xmath25 has a fiducial value of 10% .",
    "+ 2 . a low radiative efficiency for the accretion phenomenon whereby most of the viscously generated energy",
    "is carried through the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "this is more commonly called an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "strong line of sight extinction to the nucleus of ngc4258 , makes estimating the intrinsic spectral energy distribution difficult .",
    "wilkes et al .",
    "( 1995 ; hereafter w95 ) detected a polarized continuum with f@xmath28 in scattered light at visible wavelengths .",
    "the luminosity of the central source is only weakly constrained by these observations to lie in the range 10@xmath29 ergs s@xmath10 and is dependent on the scattering model .",
    "infrared observations are less susceptible to extinction effects and are therefore a better probe of the energy spectrum and the output luminosity .",
    "chary & becklin ( 1997 , hereafter cb97 ) detected a compact infrared source in the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "based on the visible light polarimetric observations of w95 , cb97 concluded that the intrinsic spectrum of the infrared source is a power law ( f@xmath30 ) and that the observed @xmath6 , @xmath6  colors could be explained by about 17 mags of visual extinction along the line of sight . while the absolute extinction corrected luminosity at these wavelengths",
    "is consistent with an adaf model ( lasota et al .",
    "1996 ) , the derived spectrum poses some problems because at these wavelengths , both the adaf model and the standard thin disk model predict a @xmath31 comptonized blackbody spectrum arising from a cool geometrically thin , optically thick disk ( pringle 1981 ) . in addition , infrared emission from thermal reprocessing of the central visible / uv continuum by dust in a flared disk or ` torus ' could not be unambiguously ruled out .",
    "the only observation at mid - infrared wavelengths which can potentially trace the dust distribution or constrain the overall spectrum of the central source is the 8@xmath613  @xmath0 5.7@xmath1 diameter data from rieke & lebofsky ( 1978 ; hereafter rl78 ) .",
    "this measurement could be contaminated by extended emission from regions of nuclear star formation .",
    "lasota et al .",
    "( 1996 ) applied an adaf model to fit the x - ray spectrum of ngc4258 .",
    "the model consists of an inner , optically thin flow which is geometrically thick .",
    "the adaf exists from an inner radius of 3 r@xmath32 up to a radius of 10@xmath6100 r@xmath32 where r@xmath32 is the schwarzschild radius of the central black hole and corresponds to 3.4@xmath210@xmath33 pc .",
    "the ions which are heated by the viscously generated energy have a temperature of 10@xmath34  k but their radiative timescale is longer than the accretion timescale resulting in most of the energy being transported into the event horizon of the black hole by radial convection or ` advection ' . the electrons ( t@xmath3510@xmath36 k ) produce synchrotron photons which could be the seeds for self - comptonization to produce a hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "the model also includes a cooler geometrically thin , optically thick disk which extends up to 10@xmath37 r@xmath32 to reproduce the blackbody bump seen at visible / uv wavelengths in most agn .",
    "this kind of accretion flow allows a ` normal ' accretion rate of @xmath380.2@xmath39 but requires a low radiative efficiency since most of the viscously generated energy is transported into the event horizon of the black hole by the advection process .",
    "here , @xmath40 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter defined by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) , while @xmath41 is the accretion rate in units of the eddington rate .",
    "mahadevan ( 1997 ; hereafter m97 ) has investigated the spectral energy distribution from an adaf in detail and shown that the comptonization of soft cyclosynchrotron photons results in a power law spectrum between 10@xmath34 and 10@xmath42 hz .",
    "the spectral index of the power law is essentially constrained by the mass accretion rate through the adaf .    in this paper , we present high resolution imaging of the nucleus of ngc4258 at mid - infrared and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the observations place a better handle on the spectrum and bolometric luminosity of the central engine .",
    "this allows us to constrain the mass accretion rate @xmath26 of the black hole based on the different accretion models which have been proposed .",
    "the 1.1  @xmath0 to 2.2  @xmath0 data were obtained using the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera 2 on the hubble space telescope ( thompson et al .",
    "the camera has a 256@xmath2256 hgcdte array with pixel scales of 0.0762@xmath1 and 0.0755@xmath1 per pixel in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , providing a @xmath45 field of view .",
    "frames were taken in three filters : f110w , f160w and f222 m , which correspond to 1.1  @xmath46 m , 1.6  @xmath46 m , and 2.2  @xmath46 m respectively .",
    "observations of the galaxy were made using a four - point spiral dither in each filter setting ; the offset per dither position was 25.5 pixels ( 1.9@xmath1 ) .",
    "non - destructive reads ( multiaccum ) were obtained at each dither position , with integration times of 40 ( f110w , f160w ) and 56 ( f222 m ) seconds per position .",
    "the total integration times were thus 160 ( f110w , f160w ) and 224 ( f222 m ) seconds .",
    "in addition to the galaxy observations , blank - sky observations were done with the f222 m filter to determine the background level at 2.2  @xmath46 m , and dark frames were taken using the same multiaccum sequences as the galaxy observations .",
    "the data were reduced with iraf .",
    "the dark was first created , then the nicmos data were dark subtracted , flatfielded and corrected for cosmic rays using the iraf pipeline reduction routine calnica ( bushouse 1997 ; see scoville et al .",
    "1999 for details about the reduction procedure ) .",
    "the calibrated images contained pixels with reduced quantum efficiency due to contaminants on the array surface , thus a mask was created to minimized their effect .",
    "the coronographic hole and column 128 were also masked on all images , the latter feature was masked due to its sensitivity to minute discrepancies in dark subtraction ( i.e. , the dark current rises sharply toward the center column of the array ) .",
    "the dithered images were then shifted and averaged using the drizzle routine in iraf ( fruchter & hook 1997 ) . finally , a background level of 0.45 adu / s was measured from the blank - sky data , and this amount was subtracted from the 2.2  @xmath46 m image of ngc 4258 . the background level at 1.1  @xmath46 m and 1.6  @xmath46 m was ignored since it is typically less than 0.01 adu / s .",
    "the plate scales of the final ` drizzled ' images , shown in figure 1 , are 0.0381@xmath1 and 0.0378@xmath1 per pixel in @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "flux calibration of the images were done using scaling factors of 2.195@xmath47 , 2.207@xmath47 , and 5.583@xmath47 jy  ( adu / sec)@xmath10 at 1.1 , 1.6 , and 2.2 @xmath46 m ( rieke et al .",
    "the corresponding magnitudes were calculated using the zero - points 1909 , 1087 and 665 jy at 0 mag for 1.1 , 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath46 m respectively .",
    "the 1.1  @xmath0 , 1.6  @xmath0 and 2.2  @xmath0 images were aligned to within 0.2 pixel using centroids and elliptical isophotes generated .",
    "synthetic nicmos point spread functions ( psfs ) were generated using the tinytim routine ( krist & hook 1997 ) since no observed psfs were available .    as shown by cb97 ,",
    "the nucleus of the galaxy is clearly redder than the surrounding starlight .",
    "the colors of the nuclear regions ( 0.12@xmath1 radius from the center ) are [ 1.6]@xmath6[2.2]=0.9@xmath110.1  mag and [ 1.1]@xmath6[1.6]=1.1@xmath110.1  mag . in comparison ,",
    "the colors of the galaxy in an annulus of radius 0.5@xmath1 to 1.0@xmath1 are [ 1.6]@xmath6[2.2]=0.52@xmath110.05  mag and [ 1.1]@xmath6[1.6]=0.91@xmath110.05  mag .",
    "the reddening can be attributed to either a red central source or dust extinction of starlight .",
    "cb97 argued for the former and we provide additional evidence in this paper that this is true . to estimate the contribution of the putative source seen by cb97 at the nucleus of the galaxy , it was necessary to subtract a stellar background from the galaxy frames .",
    "the 1.1  @xmath0 surface brightness profile was fitted with an exponential and subtracted off such that the residual consisted of a central core with a fwhm corresponding to the fwhm of the 1.1  @xmath0 psf ( 0.1@xmath1 ) .",
    "there is no evidence of an airy ring in the residual and hence we conclude that we do not detect a compact component of emission at 1.1  @xmath0 .",
    "the residual has a flux density of 0.5 mjy and we consider it as an upper limit to a point source .",
    "since the 1.1  @xmath0 data do not show a compact source , it is reasonable to assume that it traces the distribution of starlight in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , the contribution from the polarized component observed by w95 , based on it s flux density and spectrum , is found to be less than 0.1 mjy at 1.1  @xmath0 .",
    "a scaled 1.1  @xmath0 surface brightness image was subtracted from the 1.6  @xmath0 and 2.2  @xmath0 surface brightness images .",
    "the scale factor was derived by performing an intensity - weighted least squares fit within the central arcsecond of the form : @xmath48}$]=a@xmath49  @xmath50}$ ] + b@xmath49  p@xmath51}$ ] where @xmath52 is the surface brightness , a@xmath49 and b@xmath49 are constants and p is the tinytim generated psf .",
    "for the 2.2  @xmath0 image , we obtain a@xmath49=1.25@xmath110.05 and for the 1.6  @xmath0 image , we get a@xmath49=1.29@xmath110.05 .",
    "this corresponds to [ 1.1]@xmath6[2.2 ] and [ 1.1]@xmath6[1.6 ] colors of 1.39@xmath110.05 mag and 0.89@xmath110.05 mag respectively .",
    "the airy ring is clearly visible in the starlight subtracted 1.6  @xmath0 and 2.2  @xmath0 images which were obtained as described above .",
    "the fwhm of the residual is also very similar to the fwhm of the synthetic psfs at the respective wavelengths .",
    "we thereby conclude that the compact component of emission at 1.6  @xmath0 and 2.2  @xmath0 is unresolved at our resolution of 0.2@xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the size of the emitting region has a radius @xmath533.5 pc at the distance of the galaxy and is consistent with the emission originating from the vicinity of the black hole at the nucleus .",
    "the profile of the central source is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the brightness of the central source was measured by standard circular aperture photometry .",
    "the observed flux density of the compact source is 4.0@xmath110.7 mjy at 2.2  @xmath0 and 0.9@xmath110.3 mjy at 1.6  @xmath0 .",
    "this agrees well with the values of 4.5  mjy and 1.1  mjy obtained by cb97 at  and  respectively .",
    "rieke ( 1999 ) has suggested that using the standard nicmos calibration numbers for red objects as above , could result in an error of as much as 0.7 mags in the intrinsic nicmos magnitude especially at [ 1.1 ] .",
    "the effect is smaller at [ 1.6 ] and negligible at [ 2.2 ] .",
    "this is because red objects would shift the effective wavelength and the zero point of the f110w and f160w filters , both of which have passbands much wider than the ground - based @xmath54 and @xmath55 filters .",
    "we estimate the amount of this error for ngc4258 by applying a conversion from instrumental nicmos magnitudes to ground - based magnitudes ( appendix a ) .",
    "this also serves a secondary purpose which is to compare the colors of the starlight in ngc4258 , derived from the nicmos data , with ground - based colors .",
    "we have converted the nicmos [ 1.1 ] and [ 1.6 ] images to ground - based @xmath54 and @xmath55 magnitudes and rederived the compact source flux density using the procedure described earlier .",
    "we find that the starlight in the galaxy has a @xmath6  color of 1.0 mag and a @xmath6  color of 0.6 mag .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the ground - based colors of @xmath6@xmath560.9 mag and @xmath6@xmath560.6 mag obtained by cb97 at a distance of 6@xmath1 from the center .",
    "these colors are consistent with the colors of late type stars expected to dominate the surface brightness in the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the resultant flux density of the central source is 1.1 mjy at 1.6  @xmath0 and 3.6 mjy at 2.2  @xmath0 .",
    "this is within the photometric errors assigned to the compact component above and hence we conclude that the wide bandpass of the filters does nt significantly affect our determination of the compact source flux density .    near infrared data",
    "were also obtained in the  ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) and  ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) bands using the cassegrain ir camera on the 5.1 m hale telescope .",
    "a  psf source was scaled to the flux density of the compact 2.2  @xmath0 source in ngc4258 and subtracted from the  image of the galaxy after aligning .",
    "the residual image corresponds to the surface brightness profile of the starlight in the galaxy .",
    "this was then normalized to the  surface brightness at a radius of 2.25@xmath1 and subtracted .",
    "the normalization factor of @xmath61=1.98 corresponds to a @xmath6  color of 0.16 mag , which is reasonable considering the @xmath6  and @xmath6  colors of the starlight .",
    "photometry was performed on the  residual image which is dominated by the compact component .",
    "we measure a flux density of 20@xmath113 mjy for this source .",
    "the mid infrared data were obtained using the mirlin camera on the 10 meter keck ii telescope in march 1998 ( ressler et al .",
    "the array is a 128@xmath2128 array with a pixel scale of 0.14@xmath1/pixel at the f/40 bent cassegrain focus of keck ii .",
    "the instrument has a square wave chopper which chops at 5 hz . the chopper throw was set at 6@xmath1 which allowed the source to be on the array at both chop positions .",
    "observations were made with a filter which is centered at 12.5  @xmath0 with a passband of 1.2  @xmath0 and a filter which is centered at 17.9  @xmath0 with a passband of 2  @xmath0 .",
    "we chopped 300 times per position and nodded by 6@xmath1 after a minute .",
    "the total integration time was 300 s at 12.5  @xmath0 and 450 s at 17.9  @xmath0 .",
    "the resultant 1@xmath62 sensitivity at 12.5  @xmath0 and 17.9  @xmath0 was 20 mjy and 50 mjy in a 2.8@xmath1 diameter beam respectively .",
    "the mid infrared data were reduced in a standard manner ( bock et al .",
    "airmass corrections were performed which were less than 5@xmath63 since the standards and source were at similar elevation angles .",
    "the final image at these wavelengths is dominated by a single unresolved source ( fwhm@xmath530.5@xmath1 ) with no evidence of extended emission on scales of diameter up to 6@xmath1 .",
    "the observed flux density of the unresolved central source is 165@xmath1120 mjy at 12.5  @xmath0 and 300@xmath1130 mjy at 17.9  @xmath0 .",
    "cb97 showed that the red near - infrared colors of the nucleus of the galaxy could not be explained by uniform foreground extinction of starlight or by stars mixed with dust .",
    "in addition , starlight can not explain the observed spectrum of the enhanced nuclear emission at @xmath64 ( table 1 ) .",
    "if the enhanced infrared emission in the nucleus arises in a compact nuclear continuum source associated with the 3.5@xmath210@xmath3  m@xmath4 black hole as argued by cb97 , it implies that the extinction observed in the x - ray data occurs in a foreground screen such as a dust lane , attenuating both the near and mid infrared intensities}$]=0.282  a@xmath17 , a@xmath65}$]=0.624  a@xmath66}$ ] , a@xmath51}$]=0.382  a@xmath66}$ ] , a@xmath67}$]=0.182  a@xmath66}$ ] , a@xmath68}$]=0.192  a@xmath66}$ ] , a@xmath69}$]=0.098  a@xmath66}$ ] , a@xmath70}$]=0.083  a@xmath66}$ ] ( mathis 1990 ) . ] .",
    "the visible / uv polarimetry data on the central source shows a f@xmath28 spectrum in scattered light ( w95 ) similar to our observed mid - infrared spectrum .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the intrinsic near - infrared spectrum of the compact source follows a similar trend and that the observed [ 1.6]@xmath6[2.2 ] color of the compact source is due to extinction .",
    "we calculate that the amount of extinction required to fit the near and mid infrared data by a single power law corresponds to a@xmath7118 mag . this is smaller than the extinction derived from the x - ray column density",

    "( 1994 ) is unreliable since it is sensitive to the relative contributions of the components used to fit the x - ray data .",

    "again , this analysis assumed that most of the visible / ir emission has a @xmath95 comptonized blackbody spectrum and arises in the cool , thin disk rather than in the adaf itself .",
    "our recent data suggests that the visible / ir emission has a common origin and has an intrinsic spectrum that can be well represented by a @xmath96 power law .",

    "( 1998 ) have shown based on their 22 ghz upper limit , that the adaf can not extend significantly beyond 10@xmath97 r@xmath32 .",
    "we find that the 22 ghz limit in conjunction with the spectrum of m97 in the self - absorbed radio regime is inconsistent with our measurements ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we predict that the radio synchrotron spectrum must have a spectral index of 2.5@xmath98 where f@xmath99 rather than the @xmath100 derived for a thermal distribution of electrons by m97 .",
    "this could arise if the distribution of electrons has a power law tail at higher energies .",
    "maintaining a power law distribution of relativistic particles without resorting to an independent injection mechanism such as magnetic reconnection has been an unsolved problem for some time now ( mccray 1969 ) .",
    "all previous work has assumed that the particle distribution in an adaf is thermal .",
    "however , mahadevan & quataert ( 1997 ) investigated the emission spectrum for different accretion rates through an adaf .",
    "they found that for low accretion rates , the thermalization of the electron distribution through coulomb collisions with the protons and through self absorption of synchrotron photons , is inefficient .",
    "adiabatic compression of the electron gas acts as the primary heating mechanism which results in the high energy tail of the electron distribution function having a non - thermal gaussian profile rather than a maxwellian profile .",
    "alternatively , mahadevan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) has suggested that if the weak galactic center source sgr a@xmath101 is associated with the egret source 2eg j1746 - 2852 , the gamma ray spectrum could be explained by an e@xmath102 distribution of protons in an adaf . a similar power law distribution of electrons would indicate that the electron distribution function is generated by the same viscous heating mechanism responsible for generating the proton distribution function .",
    "we find that the excellent agreement between the fit f@xmath74 spectrum and data obviates the need for a significant @xmath31 comptonized blackbody continuum from a standard optically thick , geometrically thin disk .",
    "however , 22 ghz observations show the existence of a thin disk with inner radius 0.14 pc which sustains the water masers ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) . from standard disk theory ( frank , king & raine 1992 ) , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is",
    "the central mass in units of m@xmath4 and @xmath105 is the radius of the disk in units of r@xmath32 . for a geometrically thin , optically thick disk to be capable of emitting blackbody near - infrared photons",
    ", it should be at least 1500  k. based on the derived accretion rate , this implies a conservative lower limit of 200  r@xmath32 for the inner radius of the thin disk .",
    "ngc4258 has associated with it a compact nuclear source at near and mid infrared wavelengths which is unresolved even at a near - infrared resolution of 0.2@xmath1 fwhm .",
    "this implies the emitting region is @xmath533.5  pc in radius at the distance of the galaxy .",
    "the observed infrared flux densities can be fit by a single power law of the form f@xmath5 from 1  @xmath0 to 18  @xmath0 after correcting for about 18 mags of visual extinction .",
    "the total extinction corrected infrared luminosity ( 1@xmath620  @xmath0 ) of the central source is 8@xmath106 ergs s@xmath10 . at shorter wavelengths",
    ", the power law spectrum seems to extend upto visible wavelengths as shown by the polarimetric observations of w95 . at longer wavelengths , the infrared spectrum along with the 22 ghz upper limit points towards a synchrotron self - absorption turnover wavelength between 20  @xmath0 and 0.2 mm . from this spectrum",
    ", we derive the bolometric luminosity of the nuclear source to be 2@xmath210@xmath76  ergs  s@xmath10 .",
    "the low bolometric luminosity and power law spectrum extending from visible to mid - infrared wavelengths indicates that self - comptonized synchrotron emission arising in an adaf is responsible for the enhanced infrared emission .",
    "the spectrum obviates the need for a  big blue bump \" at these wavelengths from a cool , optically thick , geometrically thin disk extending beyond the advection dominated flow .",
    "such a disk is predicted to have a f@xmath107 spectrum which appears unlikely from our data .",

    "in this section , we describe the color correction applied to convert the nicmos [ 1.1 ] , [ 1.6 ] and [ 2.2 ] magnitudes to ground - based @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath109 magnitudes . the color correction is applied for two reasons : + 1 . to compare the results from this nicmos data set with previous ground - based observations , + 2 . to correct for calibration errors which arise due to the wider bandpass of the nicmos f110w and f160w filters .",
    "it has been suggested that since the nicmos filters were calibrated off solar analog stars , using the standard nicmos calibration numbers could result in an error of as much as 0.7 mags in the intrinsic nicmos magnitude for red ( @xmath110  mag ) objects ( rieke 1999 ) .",
    "this error is not significant in the ground - based @xmath54 , @xmath55 filters because of their much narrower bandpass .",
    "nicmos has observed a sample of standards of different colors for which the ground - based magnitudes are known ( table 2 ) .",
