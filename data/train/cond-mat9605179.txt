    "the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) was first introduced by rokhsar and kivelson ( rk)@xcite .",

    ", rk argued that the low energy physics is contained in the `` short - range resonating valence bond ( rvb ) '' states , spanned by the set of nearest - neighbor valence bond states .",
    "nearest - neighbor valence bonds are called dimers . the basis set",
    "thus consists of all possible dimer configurations at closest - packing ( all sites form exactly one dimer with one of their nearest neighbors ) .",
    "rk also argued that the non - orthogonality of these basis states can be absorbed by defining a phenomenological hamiltonian with short range dimer interactions .",
    "the relevance of this quantum dimer model to the frustrated quantum antiferromagnet was supported by other independent studies .",

    "this spin - peierls state corresponds to the state in the qdm where the dimers are frozen into a columnar pattern ( fig .",

    "they are equal superpositions of all the dimer configurations in their sectors .",
    "therefore , the ground state at @xmath5 is a dimer liquid , and any ground state dimer correlation function can be calculated exactly by the method of fisher and stephenson@xcite for the classical dimer problem .",
    "consequently this state is called the fs state .",
    "the ground state properties of the qdm in the range @xmath18 are not so clear .",
    "there are three main questions : ( a ) is the ground state in this range ordered ( dimer solid ) or disordered ( dimer liquid ) ? ( b ) if it is ordered , what is the nature of this order ? and ( c ) if it is disordered , is there a gap in the low lying excitation spectrum ?",
    "rk suggested that a dimer liquid state can exist in a finite region of @xmath4 . by numerically diagonalizing the qdm on square lattices up to @xmath19",
    ", sachdev@xcite found evidence for the columnar state , but no evidence for a dimer liquid state at @xmath20 .",
    "however , due to finite - size effects , he did not rule out the possibility that dimer liquid exists over a finite range @xmath21 , and estimated a lower bound @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "some analytic studies have suggested the existence of a dimer liquid state at @xmath23 . by mapping the qdm to a roughening problem",

    "he inferred that the ground state is a dimer liquid for @xmath25 , with a phase transition to a dimer solid at some @xmath26 .",

    "the number of basis states for a given @xmath3 can be evaluated@xcite analytically . enumerating all the dimer configurations is much more difficult .",

    "if a system possesses a broken symmetry in the thermodynamic limit , the ground state of the finite system will still be totally symmetric . in this case",

    "these degenerate states can be combined to form four states , two with momentum @xmath35 , and two with momenta @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "consequently in a finite system which possesses columnar order in the thermodynamic limit , the state with momentum @xmath35 will be the ground state and the others will appear as low lying excited states , which are degenerate with the ground state in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "we can see that there exist a @xmath46 ( which depends on the size @xmath3 ) close to but less than 1 , such that at @xmath47 , @xmath45 and @xmath41 cross each other and @xmath45 becomes the first excited state for @xmath48 .",
    "this crossing of energy levels may imply the existence of a new ground state in the region @xmath48 . however , finite - size extrapolation analysis on @xmath46 shows that this is not the case . as shown in fig .",

    "therefore , we expect that the @xmath41 state is always the lowest excited state in the range @xmath39 .",
    "this is consistent with , but does _ not _ imply , the existence of long - range order ( lro ) in the qdm at @xmath39 .",

    "this work was supported in part by hong kong rgc grant hkust619/95p .",
    "following ref .",
    "we use the columnar state as the reference configuration to define the winding numbers . in fig .",
    "[ wind_fig](a ) , the dimers of such a reference configuration are indicated by dash lines . the arrows along the dimers always point from the @xmath68 sublattice ( solid circles ) to the @xmath151 sublattice ( open circles ) . in fig .",
    "[ wind_fig](b ) , a dimer configuration ( indicated by solid lines ) is superimposed on the reference configuration , but the arrows along the dimers ( solid lines ) point from the @xmath151 sublattice to the @xmath68 sublattice .",
    "this results in directed close paths which may wrap around the boundaries ( with periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "the winding numbers @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the net number of loops ( clockwise minus counterclockwise ) wrapping around the boundaries in the @xmath154 and @xmath155 directions respectively .",
    "each dimer configuration has a unique pair of winding numbers . by repeatedly flipping parallel dimer pairs",
    "( i.e. , applying @xmath11 ) of a dimer configuration , one can generate all dimer configurations with the same winding numbers .",
    "but no two configurations with different winding numbers are related by such dimer flipping operations .",
    "therefore , the hilbert space spanned by all close - packed dimers can be divided into subspaces labelled by winding numbers .    to calculate the winding numbers of a given dimer configuration , we start from a site and traverse the lattice following the arrows as described above until we return to the starting site .",
    "we mark all the sites along this path and count the net number of times it crosses the boundaries in the @xmath154 and @xmath155 directions .",
    "this procedure is repeated starting from an unmarked site until all sites are marked .",
    "it is easy to see that the columnar dimer state in fig .",
    "[ dimer](a ) has winding numbers @xmath35 , and the staggered state in fig .",
    "[ dimer](b ) has winding numbers @xmath15 .",
    "in this appendix we describe the way we generate all the close - packed dimer configurations on an @xmath0 lattice .",
    "again we divide the square lattice into two sublattices @xmath68 and @xmath151 . at close - pack , each site is one end of exactly one dimer .",
    "consequently , a dimer configuration can be represented by specifying the direction ( @xmath156 or @xmath157 ) of the dimer attached to each site in the @xmath68 sublattice .",
    "there are @xmath158 such combinations .",
    "but most of them are forbidden because some sites in the @xmath151 sublattice have zero or more than one dimer attached .",
    "the most straightforward way to enumerate all the dimer configurations is to scan through these @xmath158 combinations to identify the allowed configurations .",
    "but this takes prohibitively long for @xmath32 .",
    "we need a clever way to identify and eliminate the forbidden configurations quickly .",
    "we further divide the @xmath68 sublattice into two quarter - lattices @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "each site takes up two bits in a computer word , with the four binary values 00 , 01 , 10 , and 11 representing the direction of the dimer attached to it .",
    "we divide our task into two steps .",
    "first we generate allowed configurations for @xmath159 alone , without considering @xmath160 .",
    "then we generate the allowed configurations for @xmath160 under the constraints of the @xmath159 configurations .",
    "the @xmath159 and @xmath160 configurations together give all the allowed dimer configurations .",
    "@xmath159 has @xmath161 sites .",
    "each @xmath159 configuration is represented in the computer by an integer word with at least @xmath162 bits .",
    "the @xmath163th and @xmath164th bits of the integer word represent the direction of the dimer attached to the @xmath165th site of @xmath159 . in this way each @xmath159 configuration is uniquely associated with an integer value . to scan through all the possible @xmath159 configurations , we start from an integer value @xmath166 whose binary representation has 1s in the lower @xmath167 bits , and 0s otherwise .",
    "this integer value corresponds to the @xmath159 configuration with all dimers pointing in the same direction . successively decreasing this integer value by 1",
    "is equivalent to rotating the dimers in all possible directions starting from the 0th , 1st , @xmath168 sites . in this way",
    "all possible @xmath159 configurations can be generated .",
    "for each integer value ( i.e. , possible @xmath159 configuration ) , we check for conflict starting from the last site .",
    "if at some stage we find that the dimers attached to the @xmath117th and @xmath165th sites ( @xmath169 ) of @xmath159 are conflicting ( both connect to the same site in the @xmath151 sublattice ) , we can skip all the bits lower than the @xmath163th bit , i.e. , instead of decrementing the integer value by 1 , we can go to the next possible configuration by changing the @xmath163th and @xmath164th bits .",
    "this substantially decreases the run time . for @xmath32",
    ", @xmath159 has 9983558 allowed configurations .",
    "the set of allowed configurations for @xmath160 is the same as that for @xmath159 .",
    "naively we can match these two sets of configurations and eliminate the forbidden ones .",
    "but this involves @xmath170 steps for @xmath32 and will take prohibitively long .",
    "we must fully utilize the geometrical constraints imposed by the @xmath159 configurations when enumerating the possible @xmath160 configurations . for a particular @xmath159 configuration ,",
    "we mark the allowed dimer directions for each site in @xmath160 under the constraints imposed by that @xmath159 configuration .",
    "the total number of combinations is substantially smaller than @xmath171 .",
    "we then scan through all these combinations in the same manner as in enumerating the @xmath159 configurations . repeating the same procedure generates all the allowed dimer configurations . for @xmath172 6 , and 8 ,",
    "the number of allowed dimer configurations are 272 , 90176 , and 311853312 respectively . for @xmath32 ,",
    "all the allowed dimer configurations can be enumerated in about four hours using an hp 735 workstation .",
    "we note that if the `` expansion '' is performed about staggered columns ( every other dimer column shifted by one plaquette ) additional terms proportional to @xmath173 will appear in @xmath11 , but this does not change our conclusions that a disordering transition occurs for some @xmath136 .    recalling our simple transverse ising model description ,",
    "this @xmath174 transition to plaquette rvb state should be in the 2d classical ising model , not 3d .",
    "even if the transverse ising picture breaks down , it should be generally true that the quantum phase transition of the qdm at @xmath115 , @xmath175 is in a 2 + 1 dimensional classical system universality class , while the rest of the @xmath174 critical line is in some 2-dimensional system universality class ."
