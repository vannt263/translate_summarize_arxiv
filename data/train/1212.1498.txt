    "non - thermal radio emission from a massive binary system is usually produced in the interaction of their strong winds ( see de becker  2007 for a recent review ) .",
    "an interesting case is the quadruple massive system cyg ob2 # 5 ( v729 cyg , bd + 40 4220 ) that is the only multiple system known so far to harbor two radio  imaged wind  collision regions ( ortiz  len et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "cyg ob2 # 5 is a radio - bright massive multiple system located in the cygnus ob2 association , one of the most prominent massive young clusters known , containing over 100 o stars .",
    "the most massive component of cyg ob2 # 5 ( i.e.  the primary ) is an eclipsing , contact binary consisting of two o - type supergiants with a 6.6-day orbital period .",
    "we shall refer to this central object as cyg ob2 # 5 a ( containing the individual stars cyg ob2 # 5 aa and cyg ob2 # 5 ab ) .",
    "contreras et al .  ( 1997 ) suggested that a radio source located @xmath2 to the north  east of cyg ob2 # 5 a is the shock formed by the interaction between the wind from cyg ob2 # 5 a and that of a b  type star first reported by herbig  ( 1967 ) and located @xmath3 to the north - east .",
    "we shall refer to this b star as cyg ob2 # 5 c , and to the wind ",
    "collision region between this star and cyg ob2 # 5 a as wcr(a - c ) .",
    "recently , ortiz  len et al .  (",
    "2011 ) used the very long base array ( vlba ) telescope to obtain a high angular resolution image ( @xmath410 mas ) and reported the detection of a compact wind ",
    "collision region with possible non - thermal radio emission .",
    "this structure is formed by the interaction between the wind driven by cyg ob2 # 5 a and that of an unseen companion ( that we shall call cyg ob2 # 5 b ) , an early b type star , with an orbital period of @xmath5-yr ( kennedy et al .",
    "2010 ) . as this star orbits around cyg ob2 # 5 a , the resulting wcr ( hereafter wcr(a - b ) )",
    "is undetected around what is presumed to be orbit periastron , yet can be detected as the orbit progresses to apastron .",
    "len et al .  (",
    "2011 ) noticed that the separation between the wcr(a - b ) and the position of the contact binary is 12 mas , i.e.  smaller than the nominal radius ( 23 @xmath0 12 mas ; rodrguez et al .",
    "2010 ) of the region where the optically  thick free  free radiation of the cyg ob2 # 5 a binary system is produced",
    ". therefore , the wcr(a - b ) emission should in principle be undetectable due to the free  free opacity . to resolve this conundrum , these authors proposed that the wind driven by the cyg ob2 # 5 is very inhomogeneous , as suggested for other early massive stars ( blomme et al .",
    "2010 ; muijres et al .",
    ". however , the time variability could be due to other plasma effects ( pittard & dougherty 2006 ; pittard 2009 ) .",
    "being part of the cyg ob2 region , cyg ob2 # 5 is expected to be located at the same distance .",
    "traditionally , the cyg ob2 region has been believed to be at a distance of 2.1 kpc ( reddish et al .",
    "1966 ) , although it has , more recently , been argued to be somewhat nearer ( at about 1.7 kpc ; e.g. massey & thompson 1991 ) .",
    "even shorter distances have been proposed .",
    "for instance , hanson ( 2003 ) suggested d @xmath4 1.4 kpc or even less .",
    "direct trigonometric parallaxes were obtained recently by rygl et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who measured the distances to several methanol and water maser related to objects in the cygnus x star forming complex .",
    "they found that most of them are consistent with a distance of 1.40 @xmath0 0.08 kpc , and suggest that the cyg ob2 region is located at a similar distance . using similar techniques ,",
    "zhang et al .  ( 2012 ) measured the distance to the red hypergiant nml cyg to be 1.61 @xmath0 0.12 kpc and suggested that it lies on the far side of the cyg ob2 region .",
    "thus , most recent , reliable measurements suggest a distance of 1.4 kpc for the cyg ob2 region as a whole , and for cyg ob2 # 5 in particular .",
    "interestingly , however , linder et al .  (",
    "2009 ) obtained a distance estimate for cyg ob2 # 5 itself of 925 @xmath0 25 pc from a light curve analysis .",
    "a direct astrometric study to cyg ob2 # 5 could help solve the discrepancy between the distance suggested by linder et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and the recently measured distances for other objects in the region .    in this paper",
    ", we present the analysis of a series of 12 vlba observations of the wcr(a - b ) in cyg ob2 # 5 , covering a total time span of 1.6 years . these data will be used to study the nature of the emission mechanism in the wcr(a - b ) , and the distance to cyg ob2 # 5 . in the past , our team has successfully used multi  epoch vlba observations to measure distances to low and intermediate mass stars with compact nonthermal radio emission ( see dzib et al .  2010 and 2011 for recent results ) .",
    "in the case of cyg ob2 # 5 the wind collision region is resolved with vlba observations , but should still be sufficiently compact to enable usable astrometry .",
    "a description of the observations , their calibration and imaging are described in section 2 .",
    "the results are presented in section 3 , where we also describe the structure and variability of the emission .",
    "additionally a rough estimation of the trigonometric parallax is also presented in this section .",
    "the discussion of the results is presented in section 4 , and we finish with the conclusions in section 5 .",
    "cyg ob2 # 5 was observed at @xmath6 = 3.6 cm ( @xmath7 = 8.42 ghz ) with the vlba at 12 epochs between 2010 december and 2012 july . the first observation ( in 2010 december )",
    "was designed as a detection experiment and was reported by ortiz ",
    "len et al .  (",
    "2011 ) . following this successful detection",
    ", we initiated a series of multi - epoch observations .",
    "the separation between successive observations in those multi - epoch data was about 1.5 months ( table [ tab : lri ] ) .",
    "they were usually realized at a recording rate of 512 mbps but the epoch 2011 october was recorded using a rate of 2 gbps , to test new vlba equipment . as a consequence ,",
    "the noise level for this epoch was significantly better .",
    "the observations consisted of series of cycles with two minutes spent on source , and one minute spent on the main phase - referencing quasar j0218 + 3851 , located @xmath8 away .",
    "every 15 minutes , the radio bright x - ray binary cyg x-3 , located at @xmath9 from cyg ob2 # 5 , was also observed .",
    "although cyg x3 is very close to cyg ob2 # 5 it was not used as a primary calibrator due to its extreme variability in both flux density and morphology and the fact it is heavily scattered at the observing frequency ( desai & fey 2001 ) . as we shall see , however , it was used for secondary calibration .",
    "the total duration of the observations was 5 hours for the 2010 december observation and 2 hours for the other epochs .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated using the aips software , following standard procedures for phase  referenced vlba observations .",
    "the calibration determined from the observations of j0218 + 3851 was applied to both cyg ob2 # 5 and cyg x-3 .",
    "at this point , most of the phase errors left are caused by the @xmath8 separation between the source and the phase calibrator .",
    "to remove most of this , cyg x3 was self - calibrated in phase and the incremental phase gains determined from that self - calibration were interpolated and applied to cyg ob2 # 5 . in most of the epochs , this resulted in a significant improvement in the quality of the image of cyg ob2 # 5 compared to a direct phase transfer between j0218 + 3851 and cyg ob2 # 5 . for epochs 2011 august and 2011 december , however , this step worsened the image , presumably because of the high variability of cyg x3 . for those epochs ,",
    "we use the images obtained without applying this step .",
    "cyg ob2 # 5 is quite resolved , so the best images were made by limiting the maximum uv length to 60000 k@xmath6 and using always natural weighting .",
    "the total flux for each detection in these images was determined using the aips task imstat . the rms noise level in the final images ( shown in figure [ fig : lri ] )",
    "was 43110 @xmath10jy beam@xmath11 ( table [ tab : lri ] ) .",
    "additionally , high resolution images were made using the whole uv range .",
    "the epochs at which the source was significantly detected in this second set of images are shown in figure [ fig : hri ] .",
    "as we will see , significant variations in the flux of cyg ob2#5 were found .",
    "it is , therefore , worthwhile to examine in some detail the accuracy of the absolute flux calibration .",
    "we followed the standard vlba recipes , based on gain and system temperature , for the absolute flux calibration .",
    "these methods are applied similarly to the target ( cyg ob2 # 5 ) and the gain calibrator ( j0218@xmath123851 ) so any systematic error should affect equally both sources .",
    "we inspected the obtained flux of j0218@xmath123851 and found no systematic differences from epoch to epoch .",
    "instead , we found a random scatter of about 0.035 jy around a mean value of 0.308 jy .",
    "thus , the dispersion is about 10% of the mean and we will use that figure as our flux uncertainty.3851 is likely to be intrinsically moderately variable , and part of the observed scatter might reflect this intrinsic variability . as a consequence , our accuracy might well be better than the quoted 10% . ]    given the @xmath8 separation between the gain calibrator and the target , part of the target flux might be lost under adverse weather conditions due to decorrelation .",
    "this can also be discarded using the observations of cyg x3 that were intertwined with the observations of cyg ob2 # 5 .",
    "cyg x3 and cyg ob2 # 5 are very near each other ( separation of about @xmath13 ) while the phase calibrator is @xmath8 degrees away .",
    "thus , if the phase transfer from the phase calibrator to the target were responsible for significant decorrelation on cyg ob2#5 , it should also induce significant decorrelation on cyg x3 .",
    "we checked that this was not the case in any of our images , by comparing the flux measured in our vlba observations with ( publicly available ) monitoring observations of cyg x3 made with the ami - large array telescope at 15 ghz .",
    ".observed epochs , flux densities ( with statistic and systematic errors ) , and noise levels of the low resolution vlba images .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     cyg ob2 # 5 b must drive a wind strong enough to produce the wcr(a - b ) when it interacts with the winds of the eclipsing binary cyg ob2 # 5 a. as discussed by kennedy et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and ortiz  len et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , this suggests that cyg ob2 # 5 b is of b0.5 or earlier spectral type .",
    "the value of @xmath14 for a b0.5 star ( table [ tab : pms ] ) yields an upper limit on the distance to cyg ob2 # 5 of 1.44 kpc .",
    "this result is , again , in agreement with our measured trigonometric parallax , and with distances proposed by hanson ( 2003 ) , rygl et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and zhang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "running the same argument in reverse , we can place an upper limit on the value of @xmath14 considering the highest possible mass for the system ( 90 m@xmath15 ) and shortest possible distance ( 1.26 kpc ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath14 = 0.047 , corresponding to a spectral type o8 for cyg ob2 # 5 b. this explains _ a posteriori _ why cyg ob2 # 5 b contributed negligibly to the thermal radio emission of the system : the total free - free emission from an o8 star at the distance of cyg ob2 # 5 being only about 30 @xmath10jy .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that our results depend strongly on the orbital parameters reported by kennedy et al .",
    "fortunately , once a model is selected , their largest errors are in the inclination of the orbit , while our calculations depend most strongly on the argument of periastron and the eccentricity .",
    "in this paper , we presented an analysis of a series of multi  epoch vlba observations of the compact wind collision region in the cygnus ob2 # 5 quadruple system .",
    "the brightness temperatures for the most compact emission is @xmath16 k , clearly suggestive of a non - thermal process .",
    "the total measured flux is consistent with a constant value of @xmath17 mjy for the first seven epochs , but falls below the detection limit for the latest observations .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation proposed by kennedy et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that the shocked region plunges into the photo - ionized region surrounding the primary in the system .",
    "in addition , in one of the early epochs , the flux drops significantly .",
    "we suggest that for this epoch , a dense clump of the inhomogeneous wind intersect the sight of view , and the free  free emission partially hides the non - thermal emission from the wind collision region .",
    "the measured trigonometric parallax for the system corresponds to a distance of 1.65@xmath18 kpc .",
    "in addition , the distance to the system was estimated using two indirect methods , both yielding distances of order 1.31.4 kpc .",
    "these results are in agreement with recently measured trigonometrical parallaxes to masers related with objects in the cygnus x star forming complex , and discard the small value of 950 pc suggested by linder et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    a new set of vlba observations when the wcr(a - b ) comes back to its  on  state , combined with the positions presented in this work , could be used for a better determination of the trigonometrical parallax of the cygnus ob2 # 5 quadruple system .",
