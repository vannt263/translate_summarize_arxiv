    "most of the progress was achieved for the scaling dimensions @xmath11 of primary operators @xmath12 which determine the 2-point functions @xmath13 ( for reviews see ) .",
    "the next step is to understand 3-point functions @xmath14 which , in addition to @xmath15 , are determined by non - trivial functions @xmath16 .",
    "higher - point correlation functions , though in principle dictated by the ope , are much more complicated .",
    "for example ,",
    "conformal invariance implies that a 4-point correlator @xmath17 should , in general , contain a non - trivial function of the two conformal cross - ratios @xmath18   ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) and @xmath7 .",
    "correlators of primary operators are natural observables in cft . in addition , in a gauge theory , one may consider also expectation values of wilson loops . an important class of these , related to gluon scattering amplitudes ( see and for reviews ) , are expectation values of wilson loops in the fundamental representation @xmath21 corresponding to polygons built out of null lines with @xmath1 cusps ( located at @xmath22 with @xmath23 ) .",
    "they were previously studied at weak and at strong coupling .",
    "conformal invariance ( broken by the presence of the cusps in a controllable fashion ) implies that for @xmath24 these expectation values are fixed functions of @xmath25 ( depending on a few @xmath7-dependent coefficients , in particular , on the cusp anomalous dimension ) while for @xmath26 they should depend on @xmath27 cross - ratios of the cusp coordinates .",
    "the first non - trivial example is @xmath28 which is expressed in terms of a function of @xmath7 and three cross - ratios . for recent progress in computing this function at weak and at strong coupling",
    "see .    as suggested in ,",
    "there is a close relation between certain correlators of local ( bps ) operators and expectation values of cusped wilson loops : a correlator @xmath29 of primary operators ( e.g. , the highest weight part of 20 scalar ) located at positions of the null cusps is proportional to the expectation value of the null polygon wilson loop in the adjoint representation ( or to @xmath30 in the planar approximation we will consider here ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the most singular term in the tree - level ( @xmath33 ) part of @xmath34 .",
    "in this paper we study a new observable that involves both a local operator and a cusped wilson loop , i.e. @xmath35 ( @xmath36 will denote the position of the local operator ) .",
    "one motivation is that such correlators may lead to new simple examples where one may be able to interpolate from weak to strong coupling . in particular , in the first non - trivial case @xmath5 such correlator happens to be a function of just _",
    "one _ non - trivial conformal ratio formed from the coordinates of the cusps @xmath25 and the operator @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 it will be a function of @xmath4 conformal ratios ) . for comparison , in the case of a circular wilson loop ( which , in fact , may be viewed as an @xmath39 limit of a regular null polygon ) the dependence of the correlator @xmath40 on the location of the operator @xmath36 is completely fixed by conformal invariance . determining such a function ( both at weak and at strong coupling ) should be easier than the function of the two conformal ratios in the 4-point correlator case or the function of the three conformal ratios in the 6-cusp wilson loop case .",
    "we shall demonstrate this below by explicitly computing the leading contributions to @xmath41 both at strong and at weak coupling ( for @xmath42 being the dilaton or a chiral primary operator ) .",
    "another motivation to study such `` mixed '' correlators is that they may shed more light on the relation between the correlators of null - separated operators and cusped wilson loops mentioned above .",
    "that relation was verified at weak coupling , but checking it explicitly at strong coupling remains an important open problem .",
    "for example , one may start with a @xmath43 -point correlator and consider a limit in which only @xmath1 of the locations of the operators become null - separated and attempt to relate this limit to @xmath35 with @xmath44 .",
    "more explicitly , since the derivative of a correlator over the gauge coupling brings down a power of the super ym action which is the same as the integrated dilaton operator , the relation @xmath45 implies that ( x^(1 ) ) ...",
    "( x^(n ) ) d^4 a   _ dil(a ) ~2 w_n w_n d^4 a   _ dil(a )  . assuming that the integral over @xmath36 can be omitted and , furthermore , the dilaton operator can be replaced by a generic local operator one may conjecture that @xmath46 , i.e. that _",

    ". finally , it would be very interesting to understand what is a counterpart of @xmath35 on the `` t - dual '' scattering - amplitude side , e.g. , if there is any relation to form factors given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 s stand for local fields like vector potential , cf . .",
    "let us briefly review the contents of this paper . in section 2 , we shall use general symmetry considerations to determine the structure of the correlator ( [ 1.1 ] ) of a null @xmath1-polygon wilson loop and a conformal primary operator .",
    "we shall explicitly discuss the case of @xmath5 where the result will be expressed in terms of a function @xmath3 of only one non - trivial conformal ratio ( [ ges ] ) depending on the locations of the operator and the cusps .",
    "taking the @xmath49 limit then determines the corresponding ope coefficient .    in section 3",
    "we explicitly compute the @xmath5 correlator at strong coupling using semiclassical string theory methods , i.e. evaluating the vertex operator corresponding to @xmath42 on the string surface ending on the null quadrangle .",
    "we shall explicitly determine the strong - coupling form of the function @xmath3 for the two cases : when @xmath42 is the dilaton or is a chiral primary operator .",
    "we shall also discuss the generalization to the case of non - zero r - charge or angular momentum in @xmath50 .",
    "in section 4 we note that since the string world surface ending on a null quadrangle is related ( by a euclidean continuation and conformal transformation ) to the surface describing folded spinning string in the infinite spin limit , the correlator computed in section 3 may be related to the strong - coupling limit of 3-point correlator of two infinite spin twist-2 operators and a dilaton operator .",
    "the latter correlator may be computed using similar semiclassical methods .",
    "we point out that while the integrands in the two expressions are indeed the same , the ranges of integration are different .",
    "the two integrals , however , are indeed proportional for a special choice of the locations of the twist-2 operators .    in section 5",
    "we discuss the computation of the correlator @xmath35 at strong coupling for higher number of cusps @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , the explicit form of the space - time solution is not know in this case , but using the approach of we are able to compute the correlator numerically in the limit when the dilaton is far away from the null polygon , i.e. to find the ope coefficient corresponding to the dilaton in the expansion of the wilson loop in its size .",
    "in section 6 we turn to the evaluation of this correlator at weak coupling , i.e. in perturbative gauge theory .",
    "we explicitly see that the leading term in @xmath41 has a form consistent with the one expected on symmetry grounds with the function @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a constant .",
    "we consider a generalization to @xmath38 and compute the ope coefficient for the dilaton in the case of a regular null polygon for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "we also compute the leading order @xmath7 term in @xmath3 in the case of the regular null polygon with @xmath54 .    in section 7",
    "we summarize our results and mention some open questions . in appendix",

[ 1.2 ] in general , @xmath98 and @xmath3 in ( [ 1.2 ] ) may depend also on the coupling @xmath7 , i.e. they may look different at weak and at strong coupling , but the general structure ( [ 1.2 ] ) should be universal .",

    "we will need to assume that @xmath1 of such vanishing factors in numerator of ( [ rat ] ) get cancelled against similar factors in some cross - ratios contained in @xmath123 .",

    "one can check that this expression is invariant under both dilatations and inversions and can thus be expressed in terms of cross - ratios .",

    "one may wonder how the rational powers in ( [ 1.2 ] ) may appear in a weak - coupling perturbation theory .",
    "the point is that one can recover integer powers for an appropriate @xmath3 .",
    "we shall comment on this issue in appendix a on the example of @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "the number of variables @xmath92 is @xmath133 , i.e. @xmath3 should be a function of a _ single _ variable @xmath134 . for @xmath131 the number of conformal ratios is already 4 .",
    "this makes the correlation function   for @xmath5 a particularly interesting and simple case to study .",
    "as it follows from the above discussion , this variable @xmath135 can be viewed as the unique conformal ratio which one can build out of the coordinates @xmath136  ( @xmath137 ) of 4 cusps and the location @xmath37 of the operator @xmath56 .",
    "assuming that the null quadrangle is ordered as @xmath138 ( i.e. @xmath139 ) it is easy to see that the unique non - trivial conformally - invariant combination of these 5 points is =  .",
    "[ ges ] in this case there is also a unique choice for the @xmath25-dependent factor in ( [ 1.2 ] ) : @xmath140 that ensures the right dimensionality of the result .",
    "we conclude that the correlation function   for @xmath5 should have the following general form ( w_4 , a)=  f ( ) , [ 1.15 ] where @xmath141 is the dimension of the operator @xmath42 and @xmath135 is given by  .    as discussed above , the same conclusion applies also to a correlator of 4 equivalent null - separated operators and an extra operator @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath5 it is easy to see that ( [ rat ] ) is to be multiplied , according to ( [ mul ] ) , by   , which is a product of two cross - ratios in power @xmath142 .",
    "it is interesting to note that depending on just _",
    "one _ conformal ratio , the @xmath5 correlator ( [ 1.15 ] ) is an `` intermediate '' case between a 3-point function @xmath143 which is completely fixed by conformal invariance ( up to a function of the coupling ) and a generic 4-point function @xmath144 which depends on two conformal ratios .    in the limit when @xmath145 we get & & c ( w_4 , a)_|a| =  , [ 1.16 ] + & & ( |x^(1 ) -x^(3)| |x^(2 ) -x^(4)|)^/2  f ( _ )  ,  _ = , [ 1.166 ] where @xmath146 thus determines the corresponding ope coefficient in ( [ 22 ] ) .",
    "another special limit is when the position of the operator approaches the location of one of the cusps , e.g. , @xmath147 . setting @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and using that the vectors @xmath150 and @xmath151 are null we find from   that @xmath135 is ,",

    "ax^(1 )   4 ^   ( x^(1)-x^(2 ) )  ( x^(1)-x^(4 ) )  |x^(1)-x^(3)|^2 .",
    "[ 1.18 ] thus ( w_4^(reg ) , a)__ax^(1 )   ~  .",
    "note that this is the same behavior that would be expected if the wilson loop were replaced by a product of 4 same - type operators ( e.g. , scalar operators as in ) at the positions of the cusps : @xmath152 .",
    "then the limit @xmath153 would be determined by the ope , @xmath154 .",
    "one may also consider a limit when @xmath36 does not approach a cusp but becomes null - separated from it , i.e. @xmath155 . in this case",
    "the correlator will be divergent , i.e. having @xmath156 is important for finiteness .",
    "this is analogous to the observation in that keeping @xmath157 finite in the correlator of local operator effectively regularizes the null cusp divergences of the corresponding wilson loop .",
    "below we will explicitly verify the general form ( [ 1.2]),([1.15 ] ) of the correlator ( [ 1.1 ] ) at leading orders in the strong - coupling ( section 3 ) and the weak - coupling ( section 6 ) expansions and compute the corresponding function @xmath3 .",
    "in this section we will compute ( [ 1.1 ] ) for @xmath5 corresponding to the 4-cusp wilson loop at strong coupling .",
