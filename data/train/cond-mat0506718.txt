    "it is well established that in a one - component bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) with a positive scattering length , which has cigar - shaped geometry , one can generate dark solitons  @xcite .",
    "experimental generation of two - component bec s of different hyperfine states of rubidium atoms in a magnetic trap  @xcite and of sodium atoms in an optical trap @xcite stimulated theoretical studies devoted to the meanfield dynamics of multicomponent condensates .",
    "as in the one - component case special attention was devoted to existence of solitary waves in such systems .",
    "when a condensate is cigar - shaped and has relatively low density , i.e. when the healing lengths of the components are much larger than the transverse dimension of the condensate and much less than its longitudinal dimension , the transverse atomic distribution is well approximated by the gaussian ground state and the system of coupled gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equations , describing the mixture ( see e.g. @xcite ) , can be reduced to the coupled one - dimensional ( 1d ) nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the respective models were a subject of recent theoretical studies .",
    "in particular , coupled large - amplitude dark - bright solitons have been reported in  @xcite ; bound dark solitons have been numerically studied in @xcite , where it has been found that creation of slowly moving objects is possible ; a diversity of other bound states has been generated numerically in @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims further analytical and numerical study of dark solitons in two - component bec s .",
    "main distinctions of the situation considered here compared to the previous research are as follows .",
    "( i ) we consider _ vector _ dark solitons , i.e. states where two components move with equal or approximately equal velocities .",
    "( ii ) we do not impose the condition of equality of the nonlinear coefficients , as a necessary condition , allowing one to reduce the problem to the exactly integrable one  to the so - called manakov problem , for which vector dark solitons are known @xcite .",
    "( iii ) in the small amplitude limit we provide analytical description of the phenomenon reducing a system of coupled nls equations to a system of coupled korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equations , what allows us to predict existence of two types of vector dark solitons , moving with different velocities .",
    "( iv ) finally , we study in detail the effect of the magnetic trap on the dark soliton dynamics .",
    "we show that , due to difference of its effect on different component , a magnetic trap leads to splitting of the components and subsequent destruction of vector dark solitons .",
    "evolution of a two - component bec composed of different hyperfine states is described by the coupled gp equations ( @xmath0 )  @xcite @xmath1\\psi_j \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the macroscopic wave functions of the states , @xmath4 are scattering lengths of the respective interactions  it will be assumed that they are positive , @xmath5 are transverse linear oscillator frequencies of the components , and @xmath6 is the aspect ratio of the condensate . respectively , @xmath7 is the number of atoms of @xmath8-th component and @xmath9 is the total number of atoms .    in the case of an elongated trap ,",
    "when @xmath6 is small enough , and when densities of the both components are low enough , one can employ the multiple - scale expansion method in order to reduce the original 3d system ( [ gp ] ) to the homogeneous coupled 1d gp equations ( for details of derivation see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath10 here @xmath11 @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the dimensionless wave function envelops , slow time and slow coordinate , respectively , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
    "the small parameter of the problem is defined as @xmath18    besides asymmetry of the trap and weakness of the two - body interactions , expressed by the smallness of @xmath6 and @xmath19 , respectively , our model assumes equality of the aspect ratios of the components ( @xmath6 does not depend on @xmath8 ) .",
    "meantime we emphasize that the linear oscillator frequencies @xmath5 may be very different ( say , in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the relation between the frequencies was @xmath20 ) . as a result ,",
    "even for initially equal scattering lengths , the effective nonlinearities @xmath21 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ chi ] ) , become different because of different transverse distributions of the components .    to estimate a typical value of the parameter @xmath19 we consider a binary condensate of two hyperfine states of rubidium atoms in a trap with the mean value of the transverse oscillator frequency @xmath22  hz and the aspect ratio @xmath23 ( this corresponds to the 1  @xmath24 m and 100  @xmath24 m of the transverse and longitudinal linear oscillator lengths ) . taking @xmath25  nm",
    "( here we take into account that the scattering length can be varied by using feshbach resonance ) and assuming the mean atomic density to be @xmath26@xmath27 we obtain @xmath28 .",
    "we also point out here that the respective healing length @xmath29 ( for numerical estimates we assume that the healing lengths of the both components are approximately equal ) is estimated to be of order of @xmath30 m .",
    "an initial value problem for system ( [ gp1 ] ) does not allow solution in a general case , except in the special limit , which is known as the manakov system and which is discussed below [ see ( [ manakov ] ) the respective discussion ] .",
    "some information about possible solutions , is however available in the small amplitude limit , where the coupled nls equations are reduced to the coupled kdv equations .    in this approximation",
    "a dark soliton evolves against a background what means that ( [ gp1 ] ) is considered subject to the boundary conditions @xmath31 where @xmath32 are properly normalized densities of the components . taking this into account as well as a large number of free parameters of the problem , is convenient to scale out the boundary conditions for the sake of performing the small - amplitude reduction mentioned above . to this end",
    "we introduce the total dimensionless density @xmath33 , and rescale the variables as follows : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ gp1 ] ) is rewritten in the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and thus the parameter @xmath41 determines the relation between the unperturbed densities of the components : @xmath42 .",
    "the boundary conditions now acquire the desirable form @xmath43      small amplitude dark solitons , which from the physical point of view represent packets of acoustic waves , for which weak nonlinearity and weak dispersion are balanced , propagate against a background with a speed close to the group velocity of the sound ( see e.g. @xcite , as well as consideration below ) .",
    "the background in our case is computed from ( [ nls - dimless ] ) and ( [ boundary ] ) to be @xmath44 where @xmath45 designating frequency and wave vector of a sound wave as @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively , i.e. considering a solution of ( [ nls - dimless ] ) in a form @xmath48+c_j\\exp\\left[-i(kx-\\omega t)\\right]$ ] , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are small constants , @xmath51 , one finds the two branches ( upper with sign `` @xmath52 '' and lower with sign `` @xmath53 '' ) of the spectrum of the acoustic waves @xmath54 since dark solitons will be constructed against a static background we are interested in the limit of long wavelengths , where the group velocities are given by : @xmath55 it follows from ( [ omega ] ) , that the lower branch is stable subject to the condition @xmath56 and thus , the consideration below will be restricted only to this case .",
    "we notice that this constrain corresponds to the condition of the thermodynamic stability of the condensate with the only difference , that it is written for the effective nonlinearities ( rather than in terms of the coefficients @xmath57 , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting feature , relevant to the next consideration , is that the group velocity of the long - length excitations of the lowest branch , i.e. @xmath58 , becomes zero at @xmath59 then the matrix of effective nonlinearities @xmath60 is degenerated .",
    "this situation corresponds to the manakov system , which is an integrable limit of the coupled nls equations .",
    "let us now turn to the analysis of small amplitude dark solitons . to this end",
    "we employ the idea due to ref .",
    "@xcite about possibility of the multiple - scale reductions between nls and kdv equation , noticing that the kdv equation can be obtained as a small amplitude limit of the nls like equation also in nonintegrable limit and with arbitrary ( intensity dependent ) nonlinearity  @xcite .    before",
    "going into details of calculations we make the following observation .",
    "derivation of the dynamical equation for small amplitude waves is based on introduction of the small parameter of the problem , which we will be designated as @xmath61 [ see ( [ expan1 ] ) , ( [ expan2 ] ) below ] .",
    "then the resulting evolution equation ( see ( [ kdv ] ) below ) appears in the order @xmath62 .",
    "if we now recall that the 1d reduction of the coupled gp equations is mathematically justified by smallness of @xmath19 , introduced in ( [ epsilon ] ) , and that the respective 1d nls equations ( [ gp1 ] ) appear in the @xmath63 order , while terms of order of @xmath64 are neglected , we conclude that strictly speaking the resulting kdv limit is not applicable for the description of low - dimensional bec s [ it would be valid only if one could provide the inequality @xmath65 , what is not feasible for real experimental situation , where typical values of @xmath19 are of order of @xmath66 , as it has been mentioned above ] .",
    "thus the present section although being interested from the viewpoint of the small - amplitude limit of the coupled nls equations , can not be directly interpreted as a theory of small amplitude dark bec solitons ( the issue which remains to be an open problem ) .",
    "the significance of the results obtained below for the mean - field theory of the bec is in the indication on new types of the solutions which can not be directly obtained from the system ( [ gp1 ] ) ( or ( [ nls - dimless ] ) ) .",
    "there exists one more limitation for the practical use of the small amplitude limit .",
    "it is related to the fact that small amplitude solitons are wide and their width may be comparable with the longitudinal extension of the condensate . indeed ,",
    "the characteristic size of a ( non - small - amplitude ) dark soliton is of order of a healing length @xmath67 ( as above healing lengths of the both components @xmath68 are considered of the same order ) .",
    "this means that a small amplitude soliton has a width of order of @xmath69 .",
    "the small amplitude expansion fails at the boundaries of the atomic cloud , as the density approaches zero in those domains .",
    "thus , for the validity of the theory one must require the longitudinal size of the condensate ( i.e. @xmath70 ) to be much bigger than the width of the soliton @xmath71 or in other words one must impose a condition @xmath72 .",
    "the obtained constrain is , however , not as strong as the previous one . in particular , the estimates provided the end of the sec .",
    "ii give now @xmath73 .",
    "we look for a solution of system ( [ nls - dimless ] ) in a form of a small amplitude excitation of the background @xmath74 , which moves with a velocity close to one of the speeds @xmath75 given by ( [ group ] ) .",
    "the respective analytical ansatz reads @xmath76 where the amplitude , @xmath77 , and the phase , @xmath78 , are represented in forms of the expansions @xmath79 and the new slow variables are given by @xmath80}t .",

    "one verifies , that subject to condition ( [ cond_stab ] ) the denominator in the definition of the slow time @xmath83 , which is introduced for the sake of convenience , is always positive .",
    "our aim now is to derive evolution equations for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which will describe evolution of the small amplitude dark solitons . respectively , we impose the boundary conditions @xmath86 with @xmath87 being constants , and consider equations of different orders of @xmath88 .    while equations of the zero and the first orders are satisfied identically , it follows from the equations of the 2-nd and 3-rd orders with respect to @xmath61 ( see appendix a for the details ) , that the amplitudes and the phases of the excitations of the two components are linked by the relations ( @xmath0 ) @xmath89 the obtained formula reveals essential difference between integrable and nonintegrable versions of the coupled nls equations . in the former case a zero value of the group velocity of the lowest branch",
    "does not allow existence of small amplitude solitary pulses .",
    "in other words in the integrable case there exists only one branch of dark solitons .",

    "to conclude , we have investigated dynamics of vector dark solitons governed by one - dimensional coupled nonlinear schrdinger equations . in the homogeneous case and in the small amplitude limit , when the vector soliton propagates with the velocity close to the speeds of the sound , a stable vector soliton has a velocity close to the higher velocity of the sound and exceeding speed of the slow sound .",
    "the respective subsonic ( i.e. having a velocity lower than the speed of the slow sound ) dark vector soliton is unstable .",
    "the both cases are described by the coupled korteweg - de vries equations .",
    "when the group velocity of the lower branch of the sound dispersion relation becomes zero , what corresponds to the integrable manakov system , the coupled korteweg - de vries equations obtained in the small amplitude limit are integrable ( to the best of authors knowledge , such system has not been reported in the literature , so far ) .    including a parabolic trap into consideration changes behavior of vector solitons dramatically , leading in a general case to their decay , what is explained by different eigenfrequencies of the two components .",
    "if meantime the effective traps for the both components have close frequencies , during initial times the dynamics of the vector soliton can be qualitatively ( and also quantitatively , with rather good accuracy ) described by the oscillatory motion of the soliton center with the frequency given by ( [ main_friq ] ) .",
    "relative dynamics of the components , when splitting is small enough , can be interpreted as an oscillator driven by a periodic force .",
