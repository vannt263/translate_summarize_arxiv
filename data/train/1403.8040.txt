    "in the last two decades a great attention has been devoted to the understanding of the microscopic underpinnings of the various formulations of the second law of thermodynamics on the basis on exact non - equilibrium identities , collectively known as fluctuation relations @xcite .",
    "for example , when applied to a cyclic process occurring in a system in contact and initially in equilibrium with a bath of temperature @xmath5 , the jarzynski identity @xmath6 , an exact theorem in hamiltonian ( classical or quantum ) mechanics @xcite , implies that the average work done on the system is non - negative @xmath7 , namely no energy can be extracted from the bath ( kelvin formulation of the second law ) denotes the difference between the free energy of the ( not necessarily reached ) state of thermal equilibrium corresponding to the end - point of the protocol and the initial equilibrium state . for a cyclic protocol @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 denotes boltzmann s constant . ] .",
    "likewise , clausius formulation , @xmath10 follows from a similar identity @xmath11 , that applies when a driven system is brough into contact with various thermal baths @xcite .",
    "when studying the heat @xmath12 flowing from a hot bath to a cold bath , with no external driving , the exchange fluctuation relation @xcite implies the identity @xmath13 which in turn implies @xmath14 , saying that heat , on average , can not flow from cold to hot : yet another equivalent formulation of the second law .",
    "similarly , sinitsyn @xcite derived a nonequilibrium identity for heat engines , @xmath15 , leading to carnot s formulation : no heat engine can overperform the carnot engine , @xmath16 , see also ref . @xcite .",
    "these derivations are based on the assumption that the engine dynamics is described by a stochastic jump process obeying detailed balance .",
    "sinitsyn however suggested @xcite that a more general hamiltonian derivation should be possible as well .",
    "here we follow that suggestion and provide a proof of the fluctuation relation for heat engines under the assumption that device and baths obey the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "we further extend that result to the case of reverse operation , namely for quantum refrigerators .",
    "a number of proposals have been recently made of quantum engines and refrigerators , see , e.g. @xcite .",

    "a device undergoes a cyclic process during which it exchanges the heats @xmath20 with two thermal reservoires at temperatures @xmath0 , respectively , and outputs energy in the form of work @xmath2 .",
    "we treat the reservoires and device as a compound quantum mechanical system .",
    "its hamilton operator reads @xcite : @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the hamiltonian of the device .",
    "it depends on time through the parameter @xmath23 accounting for the coupling with the external work source / sink . the device can be for example a gas in a cylindrical container of volume @xmath23 .",
    "the device undergoes a cycle of duration @xmath24 , i.e. @xmath25 . the two thermal reservoires have hamiltonians @xmath26 , while @xmath27 denote their coupling to the device .",
    "the time - dependent real coefficients @xmath28 denote the degree to which each coupling is switched on .",
    "following @xcite we consider the case when @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31 the heaviside step function .",
    "accordingly the device is prepared at @xmath32 in a state of thermal equilibrium with the cold bath . assuming the coupling @xmath33 is weak , the initial state is given , up to second order corrections in the coupling , by @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35",

    "let @xmath42 denote the respective outcomes .",
    "note that @xmath43 and @xmath41 commute with each other , hence they can be simultaneously measured .",
    "the device+baths then evolves up to time @xmath24 according to the unitary evolution generated by the total hamiltonian ( [ eq : htot ] ) . at the final time ,",
    "@xmath44 , joint projective energy measurements of @xmath45 and @xmath41 are again performed with outcomes @xmath46 . under the assumption that the total hamiltoinan @xmath47 is time - reversal invariant at each time @xmath48 , the joint probability @xmath49 of observing the energy changes @xmath50 , @xmath51",

    "the proof of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ft ] ) crucially depends on the unitarity and time reversal symmetry of the system+baths compound .",
    "because of energy conservation the work output @xmath2 equals the negative total energy change in the device+baths , hence , neglecting the weak coupling energies : @xmath59 thus we arrive at the fluctuation relation for quantum heat engines : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the joint probability of increasing the system energy by @xmath62 , exchanging heat @xmath3 and performing the work @xmath2 , and @xmath63 is the joint probability of increasing the system energy by @xmath64 , exchanging heat @xmath65 and performing the work @xmath66 in the reverse process . note that the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : frqhe ] ) does not depend on @xmath62 .",
    "this cancellation was already pointed out in @xcite , and crucially depends on the fact that the device is prepared in equilibrium with the cold bath .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : frqhe ] ) by @xmath67 and integrating out @xmath68 we obtain the nonequilibrium identity : @xmath69 invoking now jensen s inequality we obtain : @xmath70 note that @xmath71 .",
    "assuming that the machine operates as a heat engine , it is @xmath72 , hence we obtain @xmath73",
    "it is interesting to see what happens when the machine works as a refrigerator .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath74 , and prepare the device in a state of thermal equilibrium with the hot bath at time @xmath32 : @xmath75 repeating the same steps as above one arrives at : @xmath76 hence : @xmath77 assuming the engine is working as a refrigerator , it is @xmath78 , hence we arrive at : @xmath79",
    "invoking the classical version of the fluctuation relation @xcite , which reads exactly as the quantum one , the same results can be obtained within the classical hamiltonian formalism as well .",
    "note that the interpretation of @xmath3 @xmath80 as heat is only possible under the assumption that the couplings @xmath81 are weak , at least at the times @xmath82 of the two measurements @xcite . as already pointed out by sinitsyn @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ eq : frqhe ] ) includes the work fluctuation relation for cyclic processes , and the exchange fluctuation theorem as special cases .",

    "obtains @xmath84 .",
    "this same relation is also obtained , with @xmath85 , if the coupling to the hot bath is switched off , @xmath86 , or if both couplings are switched off @xmath87 .",
    "note that the quantum heat engine fluctuation relation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : integratedfrqhe ] ) , remains valid also if only the coupling to the cold bath is switched off .",
    "this evidences that what counts the most in obtaining it is the initial preparation of the system in equilibrium with the _ cold _ bath , and the ability to interact with a hotter bath ( vice - versa for a refrigerator ) .",
    "the exchange fluctuation relation @xmath88 emerges when there is no device , hence no driving , @xmath89 , and no @xmath62 , namely @xmath90 .",
    "it is important to notice that in a real implementation , where the driving @xmath91 is a periodic function of time , the system typically enters into a non - equilibrium steady state , in which at the beginning of each cycle the system is not necessarily in equilibrium with the cold ( or hot ) bath .",
    "this poses no problem regarding the validity of the here presented results , because all that is necessary for them to hold is that the system is in equilibrium with the cold ( or hot ) bath at the beginning of the driving , i.e. at the beginning of the very first cycle only .",
    "the physical meaning of the bound in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2ndlaw ] ) is that when repeating the cycle a very large number @xmath92 of times , the total work output @xmath93 over the total heat input @xmath94 can not overcome carnot efficiency .",
    "note that the efficiency @xmath95 of each single operation is a stochastic quantity obeying the statistics @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes dirac s delta function .",
    "in general neither the variable @xmath98 nor its average @xmath99 ( which can well differ from @xmath100 due to possible correlations between @xmath3 and @xmath2 ) are bounded by carnot s efficiency . for recent investigations on the statistics of efficiency",
