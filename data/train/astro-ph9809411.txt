    "the cosmological origin of grbs has been established as a result of optical follow - up observations of fading x - ray counterparts to grbs discovered with the _ beppo - sax _ mission ( e.g. , costa et al .",

    "1998 ) ergs , respectively , if the emission is unbeamed .",
    "the time profiles of the x - ray afterglow light curves are generally well fit by power laws ( e.g. , piro et al .  1998 ; feroci et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "these observations provide support for the fireball / blast - wave model of grbs ( rees & mszros 1992 ) . in this model ,",
    "a large quantity of energy released in a small volume produces a grb when the baryon loading of the fireball yields a blast wave with lorentz factor @xmath6 - 300 .",
    "such values of @xmath2 are required to avoid significant attenuation of gamma - rays through pair production processes ( e.g. , baring & harding 1997 ) .",
    "fireballs with larger and smaller baryon loading are difficult to detect because of design limitations of past telescopes ( dermer , chiang , & bttcher 1998 ) .    the success of the relativistic blast - wave model is due largely to the relative simplicity with which it explains the temporal dependence and intensity of the long wavelength grb afterglows ( e.g. , wijers , rees , & mszros 1997 ; waxman 1997 ; vietri 1997 ; chiang & dermer 1998 ) .",
    "power - law decays in the afterglow light curves result from the deceleration of the blast wave as it becomes energized by sweeping up material from the circumburst medium ( cbm ) .",
    "this is termed the external shock model of grbs , and was originally introduced to provide a mechanism for converting the energy of the blast wave into radiation during the prompt gamma - ray luminous phase of grbs ( mszros & rees 1993 ) .",
    "recent research ( fenimore , madras , & nayakshin 1996 , sari & piran 1997 ; fenimore et al .",
    "1998 ) indicates that the external shock model faces difficulties in explaining short timescale variability ( stv ) in grb light curves and afterglows as a consequence of special relativistic effects resulting from the curvature of the blast wave shell . in this _ letter _ , we construct a computer model to examine requirements of an external shock model to produce stv . in section 2",
    ", we outline the temporal spreading problem due to the curvature of a blast wave .",
    "our numerical model used to simulate this system is described in section 3 , and results are presented in section 4 .",
    "if stv in grb light curves is due to an external shock model , then the required characteristics of such a model are outlined in section 5 .",
    "the stv problem in the external shock model is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "a blast wave , expanding with lorentz factor @xmath2 , sweeps up material from a density inhomogeneity , or `` cloud , '' located at a distance @xmath1 from the explosion site .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the cloud is spherical with radius @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 represent the angle between the directions from the grb explosion site to an observer and to the center of the cloud .",
    "the blast wave first interacts with the cloud at point 1 , and stops interacting when it reaches point 4 .",
    "the largest angular extent of the blast wave energized by the cloud is defined by the locations of points 2 and 3 .",
    "the observer will record photon arrival times from each of the four points .",
    "the time delay between photons emitted from points 1 and 4 is @xmath9 \\ ; , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where the doppler factor @xmath10^{-1}$ ] , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the redshift .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 represents the characteristic duration of emission observed from a blast wave which radiates as it passes through a medium of maximum extent @xmath14 .",
    "the expression on the right side of eq .",
    "( 1 ) holds in the limit @xmath15 , implying that @xmath16 because most of the radiation is observed from a cone of angular extent@xmath17 due to the doppler effect . for constant @xmath2 ,",
    "the time delay between photons emitted from points 2 and 3 is @xmath18\\ ; , \\eqno(2)\\ ] ] where we assume that @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the right - most expression of eq .",
    "the term @xmath21 is a radial spreading time scale related to the observed interval over which the blast wave passes through the radial extent of the cloud , and the term @xmath22 is an angular spreading time scale related to the angular extent of the cloud ( see fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; sari & piran 1997 ) . the shortest temporal duration from the blast - wave / cloud interaction is defined by the maximum of these two time scales .",
    "note , however , that the pulse width from an interaction event could be longer then the kinematic minimum time scale derived here if the blast wave does not radiate its swept - up energy rapidly , or if the blast - wave shell has thickness @xmath23 . in the limit that the blast wave is approximated by expanding collisionless particles , @xmath24 ( mszros , laguna , & rees 1993 ) .",
    "the shell would be much thinner , however , if treated as a radiative hydrodynamical fluid that is compressed by the pressure of the external medium ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) , and we assume that this is the case here .    as can be seen by comparing eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) , @xmath22 is much longer than @xmath25 except within a very narrow cone of extent @xmath26 .",
    "if the blast wave is uncollimated , much of the observed radiation is produced from interactions near @xmath27 where @xmath28 . to produce stv with @xmath29",
    "therefore requires very small clouds with @xmath30 .",
    "grb time profiles commonly show pulses with @xmath31 ; thus very small clouds which individually have a small surface covering factor are required for stv .",
    "the average covering factor is the ratio of the total area of the clouds to the area of the beaming cone , and is given by @xmath32 \\equiv i_c f^2 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the number of clouds in the beaming cone and @xmath34 .",
    "the efficiency for extracting energy from a blast wave is therefore roughly equal to @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the column density of a cloud , and @xmath37 is the column density that a cloud must have to extract a significant fraction of the available energy in the portion of the blast wave which interacts with the cloud . here",
    "we implicitly assume that a large fraction of the blast wave energy is converted to nonthermal electrons and then to radiation .",
    "if this is not the case , then the efficiency is reduced and the energy requirements increased accordingly . if the explosion energy @xmath38 ergs is emitted uniformly in all directions from the explosion site , then strong deceleration occurs when the swept - up relativistic cloud mass @xmath39 equals the baryonic mass in the region that interacts with the cloud , where @xmath40 is the cloud mass .",
    "this implies @xmath41 @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 cm .    in order to extract the blast wave s energy efficiently by interacting with clouds , we see from eq .",
    "( 3 ) that a large number of clouds with thick columns ( i.e , @xmath45 ) are required to offset their small size .",
    "if , for example , @xmath46 , then @xmath47 clouds with thick columns within the doppler beaming cone will give an efficiency @xmath48 .",
    "it has been argued that pulses from the individual clouds would overlap ( sari & piran 1997 ; sumner & fenimore 1998 ) and fail to produce light curves with large amplitude variability when the efficiencies are large .",
    "we have constructed a model to assess this claim quantitatively .",
    "we use monte carlo methods to simulate the interaction of a spherically expanding blast wave with clouds in the cbm .",
    "the clouds are randomly distributed in angle , azimuth , and location . the radial distribution can be generally chosen but , for purposes of illustration , we consider a uniform distribution in the range @xmath49 cm .",
    "the mass and radius distributions of clouds can also be generally chosen , but here we consider for clarity the case where all clouds have equal radii . in the results shown here , we assume that the clouds have thick columns .",
    "this means that @xmath50 @xmath42 for clouds with @xmath51 cm ; closer clouds require larger column densities , but the number of such clouds is extremely small .",
    "we employ a blocking factor to account for occulted clouds .",
    "after the locations and radii of the clouds are selected , the program determines which clouds have been completely occulted and eliminates them .",
    "when partial occultation occurs , we weight the contribution of that cloud based on the fraction of the area that is occulted .",
    "we use the following expression to represent the angle - dependent flux density @xmath52(ergs @xmath42 s@xmath53 ) measured at observer time @xmath54 from that portion of the curved blast wave surface which is energized by its interaction with a cloud : @xmath55 where @xmath56 ( see dermer , sturner , & schlickeiser 1997 ) . in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , we approximate the pulse duration by a gaussian function with @xmath57 , which gives a fwhm pulse duration = @xmath58 . in eq .  ( 5 ) , @xmath59 is the observed dimensionless photon energy and @xmath60 is the photon energy measured in the comoving frame of the blast wave , @xmath61 when @xmath62 , and @xmath63 when @xmath64 the quantity @xmath65 represents the spectral power in the comoving frame . the above result is obtained by noting that in the limit @xmath66 , the beaming factor for the time - integrated fluence from the radiating portion of the blast wave energized by the interaction is the same as that for a spherical ball of plasma which radiates for a comoving period of time equal to @xmath67 .",
    "we approximate the comoving radiant emission by a power law such that @xmath68 in the energy range @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the photon energy index .",
    "to set the normalization for @xmath71 , we note that due to the increasing surface area of the expanding blast wave , the maximum energy that could be radiated as a result of the blast wave / cloud interaction is just @xmath72\\min(n_c / n_{cd},1)$ ] .",
    "we assume that this energy is radiated promptly , that is , the interaction takes place in the radiative regime .",
    "the relationship between the measured energy fluence @xmath73 ( ergs @xmath42 ) and the total energy emitted is @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the luminosity distance . from this relation ,",
    "we obtain the result @xmath76\\;=   f_\\alpha ( c e_c/2r)$ ] , where @xmath77 .",
    "in our calculations , we choose parameter values motivated by the observations of the candidate host galaxy of grb 971214 at redshift @xmath78 ( kulkarni et al.1998 ) .",
    "its total energy release , including prompt radiation and afterglow , could exceed @xmath79 ergs if the burst source is unbeamed .",
    "thus we choose a value of @xmath80 ergs sr@xmath81 for our standard grb energy release , which implies a value of @xmath82 if the burst energy is isotropically radiated .",
    "for the calculations shown here , we let @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( which implies @xmath85 cm for a hubble constant of 65 km s@xmath81 mpc@xmath81 and @xmath86 ) , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . in order to conserve computing time ,",
    "all clouds are placed at angles @xmath90 with @xmath91 , as we find that clouds located at larger angles make a negligible contribution to the observed flux due to the strong doppler beaming .",
    "the clouds are located in a shell between @xmath92 and @xmath93 cm .",
    "2 shows results of our calculations for a range of different cloud sizes at @xmath94 .",
    "the number of clouds within the doppler beaming cone @xmath95 is chosen in order to obtain a 10% efficiency as defined by eq .",
    "( 3 ) . in curves",
    "( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) we let @xmath96 , and 0.01 , implying a total number of clouds @xmath97 90 , 1000 , and 9000 in the respective calculations . from the expression for @xmath37 following eq .",
    "( 3 ) , this implies cloud densities @xmath98 @xmath99 . by examining the curves",
    ", one can verify that the calculated energy fluences agree with the expected energy fluence @xmath100 ergs sr@xmath101 \\sim 5\\times 10^{-6}$ ] ergs @xmath42 for a 10% efficiency .    from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we see that a typical pulse duration is @xmath102 when @xmath27 . the cloud size in curve (",
    "a ) has a value of @xmath103 cm , implying @xmath104 s when @xmath27 , comparable to the value of @xmath105 s. thus only limited structure in the light curves are seen .",
    "for the cases with smaller clouds shown in curves ( b ) and ( c ) , the light curves become increasingly variable . in many but not all cases , a very narrow pulse with large amplitude",
    "is obtained as a result of a cloud which happens to be located within an angle @xmath106 of the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "these early bright peaks might not be so apparent if the blast - wave thickness also determines the pulse duration .",
    "the light curves are most variable during the period @xmath107 s. the tendency for longer pulses to be found in the simulated light curves at later times is an artifact of the bounded cloud ranges in the numerical simulation .",
    "this effect is ameliorated when more complicated cloud profiles without sharp boundaries are considered .",
    "all these simulated grbs would be detectable with batse on _ cgro _ out to redshifts @xmath108 , noting that batse triggers on a @xmath109 flux of @xmath110 ergs @xmath42 s@xmath81 .",
    "higher efficiency events could be detected from sources at even larger redshifts ( see inset to fig .",
    "the mean number and fwhm durations of pulses for an ensemble of grbs corresponding to cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "2 are 7.9 , 19 and 42 , and 4.8 s , 1.5 s and 0.42 s , respectively .",
    "we consider only those pulses which either rose from or decayed beyond 50% of their peak value , and used twice the half - maximum duration when only one of the aforementioned cases was satisfied .",
    "norris et al .  (",
    "1996 ) has decomposed 41 bright grb light curves to find a distribution of pulse durations in the range 0.2 - 2 s. as shown in the right inset to fig .",
    "2 , cloud sizes intermediate to cases ( b ) and ( c ) are in accord with the distribution deduced by norris et al . a distribution of cloud sizes and",
    "the addition of background noise in the simulations could improve the comparison .",
    "in the external shock model considered here , stv results from the energy of a blast wave being efficiently extracted by sweeping up matter from the cbm in the form of small clouds ( compare the approach of shaviv & dar 1995 ) . if the clouds are distributed uniformly around the burst source , then a total cloud mass of @xmath111 is required . here",
    "the minimum cloud column density @xmath112 is derived for clouds at @xmath113 cm .",
    "in contrast , the minimum mass of the surrounding intercloud medium ( icm ) required to extract a significant fraction of the blast wave s energy is @xmath114 . more mass must be in the form of small clouds to ensure that their columns are thick at all values of @xmath1 , but the total mass is remarkably small in either case .",
    "the contrast between the icm density @xmath115 and the cloud density @xmath116 required to obtain stv is @xmath117 .",
    "whether such clouds can be stably confined or must be continuously reformed is unclear .",
    "we consider arguments presented against the external shock model ( fenimore , ramirez , & sumner 1998 ; fenimore et al .",
    "1996 ; sari & piran 1997 ; sumner & fenimore 1998 ) .",
    "the strongest objection is that the overlapping light curves will  wash out \" large amplitude variabilty . according to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , most clouds produce pulses of duration @xmath118 . because most clouds in the doppler cone are located at @xmath119 , stv only occurs when @xmath120 . to obtain a given efficiency , eq .",
    "( 3 ) shows that @xmath121 clouds with thick columns are required .",
    "the number of overlapping clouds in the time element @xmath122 is @xmath123 .",
    "this would apparently yield statistical fluctuations of order @xmath124 which , for @xmath125 and @xmath126 , is at the 30% level rather than at the factor - of-2 level often seen in grb light curves .",
    "this argument overlooks the fact that the small fraction of clouds at @xmath127 makes a disproportionate contribution to the amplitude and variability of grb light curves .",
    "only 1% of all clouds in the doppler beaming cone lie in the range @xmath128 , yet the duration of pulses from these clouds is shorter by an order - of - magnitude than the duration of pulses from clouds at @xmath129 .",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the pulses varies according to the factor @xmath130 , which represents a factor @xmath131 for clouds at @xmath132 when compared to clouds at @xmath133 .",
    "we therefore see that 1% of the clouds produce @xmath134% of the total fluence in very short duration , very large amplitude pulses .",
    "the amplitude enhancements continue to increase @xmath135 until @xmath136 , or until the pulse width becomes limited by non - kinematic effects .",
    "if clouds are found in layers , then the enhanced contribution of on - axis clouds might also overcome the difficulty in producing gaps in grb light curves ( fenimore , ramirez , & sumner 1998 ) .",
    "the efficiency @xmath137 defined in eq .",
    "( 3 ) represents the most optimistic case where all the blast wave energy in the region energized by the cloud is transformed into radiation . because the blast wave decelerates strongly in the region of interaction , stv",
    "can be produced through doppler deboosting even if the energized electrons do not lose most of their energy through synchrotron processes ( chiang 1999a , b ) . in this case , of course , the efficiency is much less than obtained through eq .",
    "( 3 ) .    in summary , we have examined a model in accord with the third scenario described by fenimore et al .  (",
    "1996 ) , where stv in grb light curves is produced by inhomogeneties in the cbm .",
    "this breaks the condition of local spherical symmetry , shown by fenimore et al .  to produce light curves inconsistent with observations , but requires the presence of many small clouds with thick columns .",
    "as shown here , stv in grb light curves can be produced by the external shock model under such conditions .",
    "further comparisons of grb data with model light curves will be necessary , however , to establish whether grb light curves are tomographic images of the density distributions of the medium surrounding the sources of grbs    we thank m. bttcher , j. chiang , e. fenimore , r. sari and the anonymous referee for comments and discussions .",
