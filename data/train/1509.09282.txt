    "a sensor network is composed of a large number of nodes in which each node has limited capabilities of sensing , data processing and communication . but as a network , it is able to perform some desired sensing tasks , among which estimation is one basic application . in a typical estimation problem over sensor networks ,",
    "nodes make noisy measurements of a scalar parameter of interest .",
    "the main concern is how to utilize the measurements to produce a desired estimate by only exchanging information between neighboring nodes .",
    "one important aspect of sensor networks that should be considered is that nodes usually have limited energy and computational abilities .",
    "recently , there have been considerable interests in distributed estimation schemes for sensor networks to utilize these resources efficiently @xcite .",
    "compression and quantization before data transmission at the node level is one way to reduce the amount of transmission . and",
    "several forms of quantizers have been used for distributed parameter estimation problems @xcite .",
    "although quantization errors are inevitably incurred , convergence can still be guaranteed in the presence of symmetric or balanced communications .    for large - scale field monitoring , the nodes would often be separated into several groups after initial deployment . in this scenario , compression and quantization at the node level would no longer be an energy efficient way , since long - distance communication is more energy - consuming @xcite .",
    "this problem has motivated the use of static / mobile relays to connect these separate groups @xcite , such that the communications between nodes are confined to shorter distances , while meeting certain network specifications , which leads to the notion of relay - assisted sensor network .",
    "the benefit is that with only a few relays , the degree of network connectivity can be increased ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] ( left ) ) .",
    "moreover , long - distance communications can be avoided , thus achieving better energy efficiency .",
    "although much research has been done on relay - assisted sensor networks with regard to node deployment , improvement of energy balance and so on , few results have been reported for solving distributed estimation problems in such networks . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the estimation problem for such relay - assisted sensor networks with sensor nodes ( sns ) and relay nodes ( rns ) . in our setting ,",
    "sns make measurements and do some fusion operations after collecting data from neighboring nodes ; they are the endpoints of messages .",
    "whereas rns are not the endpoints of communication , they only act as forwarders , i.e. , rns carry the collected data , until they get in contact with sns",
    "@xcite presents a recent survey for scenarios using mobile rns to collect data . rather than the centralized approaches in @xcite , we are more interested in the distributed schemes , where there are no sinks or fusion centers .",
    "all sns cooperate with their neighbors to estimate the unknown parameter based only on local transmission .    during the information exchange ,",
    "the nodes use the analog - and - forward scheme , where data are scaled and then transmitted without any coding @xcite .",
    "this scheme is attractive due to its simplicity as well as the possibility of real - time processing since there is no coding delay .",
    "a number of distributed estimation algorithms based on this analog forwarding have been proposed for sensor networks without rns .",
    "for instance , the authors of @xcite proposed use of distributed consensus algorithms for sensor fusion , where the nodes first take measurements and then start consensus algorithms to fuse the data to achieve the average or weighted average of all the measurements .",
    "these algorithms are appropriate for the scenarios where the measurement rate is much slower than the communication rate between nodes .",
    "an alternative is to combine the consensus step and innovation step together if streaming measurements can be obtained at the nodes@xcite .",
    "both methods can be shown to guarantee some kinds of convergence under certain conditions , e.g. , asymptotic convergence for noise - free case , mean - square and almost sure convergence in the presence of measurement and communication noises .",
    "we note that most works assumed that the communication topology is symmetric or balanced .",
    "this assumption significantly simplifies the mathematical analysis .",
    "moreover , however , the symmetric or balanced requirement is restrictive and imposes much computational difficulties to construct the associated weight matrices , especially when the network varies with time , which is the case considered in this paper .    in @xcite , we removed the aforementioned restrictive requirements and investigated the situation monitoring in relay - assisted networks .",
    "a distributed algorithm called dcue algorithm is proposed with certain performance guarantees .",
    "it is noted , however , that the results in @xcite only apply to time - invariant topologies with perfect channels , i.e. , the nodes can receive data from their neighbors without any distortion or noise .",
    "realistic networks suffer from noise and errors , which cause links to fail at random times @xcite , resulting in time - varying topologies .",
    "moreover , wireless transmissions are also subject to channel fading @xcite .",
    "both the algorithm and the theoretical approach in @xcite will fail in such situations .    in this paper , we extend our previous work and consider a general framework of distributed estimation over rapidly - changing relay - assisted networks with occasional sensor failures , intermittent noisy measurements and fading channels . inspired by the centralized least - squares estimation and the distributed schemes in @xcite , we propose a distributed innovation - based estimation algorithm by combining the measurement innovation step and local data innovation step together . we emphasize that although several results of distributed consensus algorithms have been proposed for time - varying networks @xcite , they can not be used for our purpose .",
    "the argument is that their convergence highly depends on the convexity property of consensus algorithms , which , however , does not hold for our estimation algorithm . to suppress the propagation of measurement and communication noises",
    ", we introduce a decaying weight in the algorithm , which tends to zero as time goes to infinity .",
    "this coupled with time - varying asymmetric communications is another big challenge , since it seems that a uniform positive lower bound on the interaction strength between nodes is necessary in consensus algorithms @xcite , not to mention consensus - based estimation algorithms . to address this issue ,",
    "we utilize a different technique that builds upon a reordered state space .",
    "this ordered structure allows us to investigate the convergence in a tractable framework , with which we can establish asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency of the proposed algorithm .",
    "additionally , we consider the parameter design issue of the proposed algorithm to guarantee desired properties for energy - constrained sensor networks . in the case of available channel statistics at the receivers ,",
    "we first give a simple form of decaying weights that serves the purpose .",
    "secondly , we present the design of amplification factors such that ( i ) the fading only contributes to an unbiased perturbation on the algorithm , and ( ii ) the transmit and received powers of each node are bounded irrespective of the number of nodes . in this way , we provide a tractable framework for distributed estimation problems in energy - constrained relay - assisted sensor networks over time - varying asymmetric communications with fading channels .",

    "we take two constraints into consideration in designing @xmath237 and @xmath59 of the proposed algorithm for an energy - constrained network .",

    "another aspect is the transmit and received powers , which should be bounded at all nodes .",

    "the next result gives one choice of such parameters with desired properties , where only simple scaling rules are adopted .",

    "moreover , if assumptions 1 , 2 and 4 also hold , and @xmath65 is set to @xmath229 with @xmath235 , then both @xmath238 and @xmath239 are bounded at each node , irrespective of the number of sns and rns .",
    "see appendix  [ app : proofboundedpower ] .    for each node @xmath248 , it is obvious that @xmath249 and @xmath250 , @xmath128 .",

    "one may ask why not use the no scaling rule , i.e. , @xmath253 for each transmitter @xmath41 .",

    "in this section , we present some simulation studies of the proposed estimation algorithm to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effects of different factors .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath268 nodes with @xmath269 sns and 3 rns to monitor an unknown @xmath270 .",
    "the network is obtained using the random geometric graph model , i.e. , nodes are placed uniformly at random over the unit square @xmath271\\times [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "we connect two nodes by a link if their distance is less than @xmath272 .",

    "we assume that only 20% of sns can measure @xmath20 every @xmath273 steps with zero - mean noise @xmath22 whose variance @xmath274 . we model the fading effect of communications as i.i.d .",
    "rayleigh distributions with the parameter @xmath275 .",
    "the receiver noises are i.i.d .",
    "gaussian with variance @xmath276 .",
    "we choose @xmath237 and @xmath256 according to proposition  [ pro : boundedpower ] and , and @xmath277 .",
    "moreover , the initial estimates @xmath278 of sns are randomly chosen from the interval @xmath279 $ ] , but remain fixed for all runs . in the following ,",
    "simulation results are presented by averaging over 100 independent runs .",
    "[ fig : ensembleaverage](a ) depicts the ensemble average of the estimate @xmath37 for nodes @xmath280 for illustration purpose .",
    "also plotted is the theoretical limit of the proposed algorithm , i.e. , the true value @xmath270 .",
    "as we can notice from the figure , each ensemble average closely approaches the theoretical value , which corroborates the theoretical result obtained in theorem  [ thm : asyunb ] .",
    "moreover , nodes within the same group , i.e. , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , achieve an agreement on the estimate faster .",
    "this is because nodes in the same group have stronger coupling strength than those in different groups . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ensembleaverage](b ) , we illustrate the performance of the algorithm via the average mean square error @xmath283 .",
    "we also plot the results of the proposed algorithm without rns and the centralized estimate for the purpose of comparison .",
    "for the centralized estimate , we assume that a fusion center has access to all the measurements , the amplification factors , and the channel statistics .",
    "we remark that the proposed algorithm without rns reduces to the one proposed in @xcite in the absence of channel fading . from fig .",
    "[ fig : ensembleaverage](b ) , we can see that @xmath284 goes to zero as @xmath115 , thus conforming the theoretical result obtained in theorem  [ thm : consistency ] .",
    "we can also see that the introduction of a few number of rns in the network would result in improved performance compared with the one without rns .",
    "this is clear by taking into consideration the fact that the directed network without rns is disconnected ( see the ideal network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : directed_graph ] ) .",
    "the result indicates that inserting several rns in the network would be beneficial to the performance of the algorithm .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmse_snr ] , we plot the ensemble average of the estimate @xmath37 , @xmath285 , and @xmath284 for different reception signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) , which is defined as @xmath286 .",
    "we adjust the receiver noise variance @xmath287 so that snr=10  db , and 20 db . as a comparison",
    ", we also provide the case that snr=@xmath288 db , i.e. , no receiver noises .",
    "clearly , the proposed algorithm solves the estimation problem for different snrs , achieving both the asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency .",
    "the results indicate that the proposed algorithm exhibits resilience to communication noise .",
    "it is also observed that as the snr increases , the estimation error reduces .",
    "whereas for higher snrs , there are only marginal improvements .",
    "this is mainly due to the effect of channel fading , which has a great impact on the estimation performance of the algorithm even if there no receiver noises .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmse_fading ] , we test the performance of the algorithm for different levels of knowledge of channel statistics .",
    "we model the uncertainty of the channel statistics @xmath289 at each node by percentage error ( pe ) . in each run of simulation , @xmath289",
    "is randomly generated , which is corrupted by uniform noise .",
    "we take the average of all pes , and get @xmath290 .",
    "if no _ a priori _ knowledge of the channel statistics information ( csi ) is assumed at the nodes , we use @xmath291 in @xmath59 of .",
    "this is the procedure for distributed estimation in the absence of channel fading @xcite .",
    "the simulation results in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmse_fading ] demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs well for smaller apes .",
    "in particular , the estimates for both ape=5% and 10% are satisfactory with respect to the first moment ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : xmse_fading](a ) ) . as for @xmath284",
    ", it tends to be bounded for ape=10% .",
    "however , when ape increases to 20% , @xmath284 is quite large and unacceptable .",
    "these results indicate that although the proposed algorithm relies on the exact knowledge of csi as in proposition  [ pro : boundedpower ] , it is resilient to csi uncertainty to some extent .",
    "we also notice that both the ensemble average of the estimate and @xmath284 grow unbounded in a few iterations , if no _ a priori _ knowledge of csi is assumed .",
    "this shows that the schemes in @xcite are no longer applicable in the presence of channel fading , and much attention should be paid to the algorithm design for estimation problems in networks affected by channel fading .",
    "next , let us examine the effect of network topology and channel fading .",
    "we consider three different communication topologies composed of @xmath292 sns and 2 rns , whose ideal topologies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topology ] . for the simulation , there are two links that fail randomly at each step for each topology .",
    "and there is one sn that can measure the unknown parameter every @xmath293 time steps , and a second sn that takes measurement every @xmath294 time steps . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_topo](a ) and ( b ) , we plot @xmath284 for the three different topologies when there are / arent channel fading .",
    "it can be observed that in the absence of channel fading , @xmath295 gives the smallest @xmath284 , followed by @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath298 has larger graph density than @xmath299 and @xmath300 .",
    "actually , @xmath298 has 10 links , while @xmath299 and @xmath300 have 9 and 8 links , respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath295 has the strongest coupling strength between nodes .",
    "and we know that stronger coupling enables fast propagation of information over the network .",
    "however , when the communication between nodes suffers from channel fading , completely different behaviors are noticed in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_topo](b ) , where stronger coupling has an adverse effect on the estimation accuracy",
    ".         +    at first sight , this result seems strange .",
    "actually , it is reasonable if we take the following facts into account : ( i ) our algorithm  - assumes that the measurement rate and communication rate are similar . for a long time period , even if the coupling between nodes is weak , all the nodes in the network can still obtain sufficiently rich information from the environment as long as the network is strongly connected ; ( ii ) communications between nodes are exposed to channel fading and noise .",
    "these undesired effects have a great impact on the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "stronger coupling means more noises are incurred in the algorithm .",
    "hence , the relative gain of each transmission between nodes will be soon outperformed by the loss of performance caused by the adverse effects .",
    "another measure of the performance of the algorithm is the disagreement of estimates of the nodes @xcite .",
    "we use the average mean square deviation @xmath301 as the indicator , where @xmath302 . the simulation results of @xmath303 without / with channel fading are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_topo](c ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_topo](d ) , respectively . in both cases",
    ", @xmath295 produces the smallest @xmath303 , which is consistent with the intuition that stronger coupling between nodes gives smaller disagreement of estimates among the nodes . to sum up , the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison_topo ] reveal that we should pay much attention to balance the performances @xmath284 and @xmath303 in networks with fading channels by deploying appropriate topologies .",
    "finally , we investigate the average number of iterations against the number of nodes in the network . we randomly generate several undirected network topologies using the random geometric graph model , and then designate 15% of the nodes as rns .",
    "other settings remain the same as in the first simulation .",
    "[ fig : no_iteration ] depicts the average number of iterations to get to @xmath284 of @xmath304 when the number of nodes in the network varies from @xmath268 to 70 .",
    "it is noticed that @xmath284 does not simply increase with @xmath16 in the presence of channel fading . in order to find out the best correlated quantities of the network topology with such behavior , we also plot the graph densities and effective diameters of the corresponding ideal topologies in fig .",
    "[ fig : no_iteration ] . here",
    "the graph density is defined as @xmath305 $ ] , where the denominator is the maximum number of links in the relay - assisted network topology .",
    "and the effective diameter is the minimum value @xmath306 such that at least 90% of the connected node pairs are at distance at most @xmath306 @xcite . what fig .",
    "[ fig : no_iteration ] indicates is that the effective diameter has a great impact on the time to convergence , which follows a similar behavior as that of the number of iterations within some range . however , when the effective diameter increases to some extent ( around 4 ) , the number of iterations will drop to a low level . from fig .",
    "[ fig : no_iteration ] , we can identify that this transition is greatly related with the graph density as can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : no_iteration ] .",
    "this result is consistent with those reported in fig .",

    "intermittent arrival of new measurements , and channel fading were taken into account .",
    "we proposed a distributed estimation algorithm based on innovation schemes .",
    "we first established the general results regarding asymptotic unbiasedness and consistency of the algorithm by resorting to the ordering technique and the generalized perron complement .",
    "then we presented the performance - oriented algorithm design in an energy - constrained network based on the theoretical results .",
