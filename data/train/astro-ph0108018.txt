    "the am cvn stars are a heterogeneous group of nine variable stars that are characterized by a complete lack of hydrogen and a strong dominance of helium in their spectra ( see tab.[tab : amcvn ] ) .",
    "observationally they can be roughly divided in three groups .",
    "first , the high state systems , am cvn and hp lib , that show broad , but shallow , helium absorption lines in their spectra and show low - level photometric variability with periods less than 20 minutes .",
    "second , the outburst systems ( cr boo , v803 cen , cp eri ) , that show large amplitude ( @xmath41 mag ) photometric variability on a timescale of days to weeks , as well as lower - level variability with periods of 20 - 30 minutes . in their bright state these",
    "are spectroscopically similar to the high state systems , and in their quiescent state they show the hei lines in emission , but spectra of these systems in quiescence are rare and of low s / n .",
    "the third category are the quiescent systems , gp com and ce 315 , that show hei emission lines and hardly any photometric variability .",
    "it is commonly assumed that these systems are binary white dwarfs where mass is being transferred from a very low - mass secondary ( @xmath50.1 ) via a helium accretion disk to a more massive primary .",
    "this scenario was first proposed by paczyski ( 1967 ) and faulkner , flannery & warner ( 1972 ) to explain the photometric flickering found in am cvn itself by warner & robinson ( 1972 ) . until recently",
    ", spectroscopic confirmation of this binary scenario was only possible for gp com , where a 46 min spectroscopic variation was first detected by nather , robinson & stover ( 1981 ; see also marsh , horne & rosen , 1991 and marsh , 1999 ) .",
    "the high state and outburst systems defied every attempt to unveil their binary nature spectroscopically , until the detection of an s - wave component in the hei lines of am cvn ( nelemans , steeghs & groot , 2001a ) . by analogy",
    "it follows that all am cvn stars are binaries .",
    "the three categories can be understood as very similar binary systems in different phases of their evolution , which proceeds from short periods and high mass - transfer rates for the high state systems to longer periods and lower mass - transfer rates for the quiescent systems ( e.g warner , 1995a ; tutukov & yungelson , 1996 ; nelemans et al . , 2001b ) .",
    "this evolution is driven by the loss of angular momentum due to gravitational wave emission .    when the mass - accretion rate is high ( high state systems and outburst systems during outburst ) the accretion disks are optically thick , leading to absorption line spectra .",
    "when the mass - accretion rate is low ( outburst systems in quiescence and the quiescent systems ) the accretion disk is optically thin , leading to emission line spectra .",
    "a similar distinction is seen in the hydrogen - rich cataclysmic variables ( cvs , see e.g. warner , 1995b ) .    to support the evolutionary sequence , it would be of great benefit to show that the quiescent spectrum of the outburst systems is indeed similar to that of gp com and ce 315 .",
    "the few quiescent spectra of the outburst systems that are available ( abbott et al . , 1992 for cp eri , wood et al . ,",
    "1987 for cr boo and odonoghue et al .",
    ", 1987 for v803 cen ) show some emission lines of hei ( especially he i @xmath65875 ) , but none show a double peaked profile .    to close this gap in the spectroscopic sequence of am cvn stars we obtained a quiescent spectrum of the outburst system cp eri with the refurbished 6.5 m mmt on mt .",
    "hopkins , az .",
    "cp eri was found as a faint , variable , blue star at high galactic latitude by luyten & haro ( 1959 ) , who observed it at 17th magnitude , @xmath02.5 magnitudes brighter than its quiescent magnitude of b@xmath019.7 .",
    "a photometric periodicity of 29 minutes was found by howell et al .",
    "cp eri belongs to the outburst systems and among them is the one with the longest orbital period , and therefore should be , among the outbursting systems , the one that resembles gp com and ce 315 the most .",
    "the system was spectroscopically studied by abbott et al .",
    "( 1992 ) who show the outburst spectrum to be similar to that of the high state systems .",
    "their quiescent spectrum shows a blue continuum with the lines of hei @xmath65015 and @xmath65875 in emission .",
    "although a double - peaked profile is hinted at , the s / n ratio of the spectrum was too low to firmly establish this . a very low s / n spectrum is also shown in zwitter & munari ( 1995 ) , but no lines are visible at all in this spectrum .",
    "we observed the source on the night of dec .  1 , 2000 with the blue channel spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt , located on mt",
    ". hopkins , az . the 500 grooves / mm grating , centered on 5200   was used with a 10 slit width and a 3072@xmath71024 pixel loral ccd .",
    "weather conditions were non - photometric , with scattered high clouds . therefore",
    "no attempt to obtain flux standards was made .",
    "the set - up resulted in an effective spectral resolution of 3  ( 180 at 5000 ) over a wavelength range of 3400 - 7000  .",
    "observations were made as a sequence of three 20 m exposures between 07:43 - 08:48 ut .",
    "henear wavelength comparison spectra were taken at the beginning and end of each observation .",
    "all data has been reduced using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the spectra were extracted using the optimal extraction routine of horne ( 1986 ) , wavelength calibrated by using the henear comparison spectra ( typical residuals of @xmath00.3 ) and normalized by using a cubic spline fit to selected wavelength regions .",
    "the median - averaged , 3-pixel box - car smoothed , quiescent spectrum of cp eri is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ave ] . we see that it is dominated by hei emission lines , similar to gp com and",
    "we list the identified lines and the equivalent widths in table  [ tab : ew ] .",
    "all clearly identified lines are double peaked .",
    "this double peaked profile is commonly seen , not only in gp com and ce 315 , but also in dwarf novae and novalike cvs , and is taken as an indication of the formation of these lines in a rotating accretion disk ( see e.g. horne & marsh , 1986 ) .",
    "the peak velocity of these profiles is a measure of the rotational velocity of the outer parts of the accretion disk and can therefore be used to constrain the system parameters . in order to improve on s / n we have added ( in velocity space ) the profiles of the most prominent hei lines in our spectrum : hei @xmath66678 , @xmath65875 , @xmath65015 , @xmath64921 , @xmath64471 and @xmath63888 .",
    "we did not use the hei @xmath64713 line because of its blend with 2 . in fig.[fig : avehei ] ( upper six panels ) we show the line profiles of these lines .",
    "the sum - averaged profile in 100 bins ( binned line ) and a double gaussian profile fit to this sum - averaged profile is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : avehei ] . for the gaussian fit",
    "we have used a symmetric profile where the width and height of the two components were kept equal .",
    "the best fitted values are given in tab.[tab : hei ] .",
    "a fit with all parameters free gave a slightly wider red peak and similar peak velocities , but did not provide a significantly better fit . from the asymmetry in the central velocity of the peaks we deduce a systemic velocity , @xmath8=23@xmath953 , i.e. not significantly different from zero . from half of the peak - to - peak separation of the the profile we deduce a rotational velocity of the material in the outer disk of cp eri of 946@xmath952 .",
    "we can use the outer disk velocity of 946 to set limits on the mass of the primary star and the inclination of the system .",
    "the size of the primary roche lobe can be approximated by ( paczyski , 1967 ) : @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the mass of the primary and secondary , and @xmath13 the orbital separation of the components in the binary .    using kepler s third law to write @xmath13 in terms of the component masses and the orbital period and collecting all numerical constants , we can rewrite eq .  [ eq : rl1 ] as : @xmath14 with the orbital period , @xmath15 , in seconds and the primary mass in kg .",
    "if we assume that the gas in the outer disk is in keplerian motion around the primary and that the disk extends to 70% of the primary roche lobe radius , before being truncated by tidal forces , we can equate the radius at which a keplerian motion of 946 is reached with 70% of the roche lobe radius and obtain :    @xmath16    with @xmath17 and @xmath18 all in si units .",
    "this can be rewritten as :    @xmath19    from the fact that the light curve does not show any ( grazing ) eclipses ( howell , 1992 ) , we can set an upper limit to the inclination of @xmath20 , which gives a lower limit to the primary mass of 0.34 m@xmath2 .",
    "since the primary mass must be lower than the chandrasekhar mass of 1.4 m@xmath2 , this sets a lower limit on the inclination of @xmath2138 .",
    "if the accretion disk only reaches to 50% of the roche lobe radius , as is often seen in cv dwarf novae ( harrop - allin & warner , 1996 ) the lower limit to the mass becomes 0.27 and the lower limit to the inclination 33 .",
    "the resemblance of our quiescent spectrum with that of gp com is remarkable , firmly establishing the connection between the long and the short period am cvn systems .",
    "apart from the similarities with gp com , there are also a few marked differences . both in gp com ( marsh 1999 ) as well as in ce 315 ( ruiz et al . , 2001 )",
    "a clear central spike with a very low radial velocity amplitude ( @xmath510 ) is seen in the hei line profiles , which marsh ( 1999 ) attributes to emission from the primary white dwarf .",
    "no such central spike is seen in the average line profile of cp eri ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avehei ] ) .    a further difference between cp eri and gp com / ce 315 is the presence in our spectrum of the siii @xmath66347 , 6371 lines and possibly the siii @xmath65987 line .",
    "these are not present in the spectra of gp com and ce 315 .",
    "marsh , horne & rosen ( 1991 ) showed that this indicates that the material in the accretion disk of gp com has a severely sub - solar metal abundance , indicating that the object is probably a halo star .",
    "marsh et al .",
    "show that for a progenitor with solar metallicity , the strongest metal lines that should be visible from the accretion disk are the siii lines we see in our spectrum of cp eri .",
    "a preliminary comparison of the quiescent spectrum of cp eri with the models as used in marsh et al .",
    "( 1991 ) suggests that the progenitor of the secondary currently seen in cp eri had lower than solar metallicity , but was certainly not as metal - poor as in gp com and ce 315 .",
    "the current spectrum is however of too low s / n to perform a quantative modelling and also to verify whether the siii lines are double - peaked and therefore originating in the disk .",
    "however , if they do not originate in the disk they must come from either the secondary , the primary or from circumbinary material after being expelled from the system . in all these cases",
    "the ultimate origin of this material is the secondary star and our conclusions on the metallicity of the secondary s progenitor remain valid .",
    "any silicon native to the primary will have diffused to the white dwarf center and will not be visible on the surface .",
    "understanding the evolution of am cvn stars is of great astrophysical importance because it touches many fields in astronomy where large gaps in our knowledge still exist . according to evolutionary models ( e.g. nelemans et al . ,",
    "2001 ) , to be seen today , am cvn systems must have survived three mass - transfer phases of which at least one was a common - envelope phase ; they could be contributors to the low - frequency gravitational radiation background ; and failed am cvn stars of the he - family ( white - dwarf plus low - mass helium star ) could explode as type ia supernovae in an edge - lit detonation and thereby contribute up to 25% of the galactic sn ia rate ( see nelemans et al .",
    ", 2001b ) .",
    "the detection of siii lines in the quiescent spectrum of cp eri shows that its progenitor must have had an appreciably higher metal abundance than the progenitors of gp com and ce 315 . detecting the metal lines also opens the possibility to constrain the evolutionary history of these systems from the chemical composition of the transferred material .",
    "the proper motion of cp eri can be derived from comparing the poss - i ( on which the source is in outburst ) and poss - ii plates : @xmath22=6.3@xmath90.6 mas / yr and @xmath23=15.0@xmath90.6 mas / yr ( van kerkwijk , private communication ) . together with detection of the metal lines , which point to a higher metallicity than in gp com and ce 315 , it seems likely that cp eri is not a population ii object .",
    "the detection of double - peaked emission lines in the quiescent spectrum of cp eri shows the physical homogeneity of the am cvn stars as mass - transferring white dwarf binaries , and opens the possibility of studying the dynamics of the outbursting am cvn stars in greater detail .",
    "it will also allow for the study of helium accretion disks that experience periodic changes from high to low mass - transfer rates .",
    "following the behaviour of the spectral lines during these transitions is an important tool to track the changing physical conditions in these unique disks , especially when these results are compared with the hydrogen - rich disks found in many other systems , e.g. cataclysmic variables .",
