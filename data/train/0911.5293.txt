    ". however , it seems appropriate in the given context to formalise the intuition that a weighted graph is the mathematical model for a mechanical linkage consisting of hinges and bars that are constrained to move in a plane ( we ignore the issue of self intersections ) .",
    "given such a linkage @xmath7 we define the space of planar configurations of @xmath8 as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the standard euclidean distance between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . by definition",
    ", @xmath13 is a subset of @xmath14 and thus inherits a natural metric space structure .",
    "observe that there is a canonical action of the group of orientation preserving isometries of the plane on @xmath13 .",
    "we define the the moduli space of the linkage , denoted by @xmath15 or @xmath16 , to be the orbit space of this action .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath0 is connected then @xmath15 is a compact real algebraic variety . in general , it is difficult to decide whether or not @xmath15 is even nonempty .",
    "an element of @xmath15 is called a realisation of the linkage @xmath8 .",
    "the problem of finding a realisation of @xmath8 is known as the molecule problem - see @xcite . in the case where @xmath15 is nonempty , it is difficult to say much about the topology of this space without imposing some restrictions on the structure of the underlying graph @xmath0 .",
    "the case where @xmath0 is a polygonal graph ( i.e. connected with every vertex of degree two ) is quite well understood and much is known about the topology of @xmath15 in this case .",
    "for example , we have the following ( see theorem 1.6 of @xcite , for example ) .    [ polygonal ]",
    "if @xmath0 is a polygonal graph , then @xmath15 is nonempty if and only if the longest edge has length at most half the total length of all the edges .",
    "moreover @xmath15 is connected if and only if the sum of the lengths of the second and third longest edges is at most half of the total length of all the edges .",

    "we will show that it is possible to easily determine , for a given series parallel graph @xmath0 and weight function @xmath5 , whether or not @xmath15 is nonempty and , in the case when it is nonempty , whether or not it is connected .",
    "the problem of deciding whether the space is connected or not is connected with the motion planning problem in robotics .",
    "the motion planning problem is concerned with the existence of a path betweeb two configurations of a robot .",
    "if we think of our linkages as a model for mechanical linkages , then the motion planning problem for this particular type of  robot \" is equivalent to finding a continuous path in @xmath15 with specified endpoints .    we will show that for the class of series parallel graphs these problems can be answered by considering a finite system of linear inequalities in the edge lengths .",
    "in contrast , we note that even for the complete graph on four edges , the smallest 2-connected graph which is not series parallel , it is necessary to solve a polynomial equation of total degree 6 ( quartic in each variable ) in the edge lengths to determine whether or not a realisation exists .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the convention that @xmath7 and that @xmath17 .",
    "in this section , we review the basic constructions and facts concerning the class of series parallel graphs .",
    "first , we fix some conventions regarding some standard graph theory .",

    "a polygonal graph is a graph isomorphic to a graph with vertex set @xmath19 and edge set @xmath23 .",
    "a polygonal linkage is a linkage @xmath6 where @xmath0 is a polygonal graph .",
    "a two terminal graph ( ttg ) is an ordered triple @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are distinct vertices of @xmath0 called the source and the sink , respectively .",
    "collectively @xmath25 and @xmath26 are called the terminal vertices of the ttg .",
    "given ttgs @xmath27 and @xmath28 we can define the series composition @xmath29 to be the ttg @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the graph obtained by identifying the vertices @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "also we define the parallel composition @xmath34 to be the ttg @xmath35 see figure [ spcomposition ] for an illustration of these constructions .",
    "observe that the operation of parallel composition is a commutative associative operation on the class of ttgs .",
    "thus , in particular , given ttgs @xmath36 for @xmath37 we can unambiguously refer to the parallel composition @xmath38     parallel and series composition of two terminal graphs . ]",
    "let @xmath39 denote the complete graph with vertex set @xmath40 .",
    "we define the class of two terminal series parallel graphs ( ttspgs ) to be the smallest class of ttgs that contains @xmath41 and that is closed under the operations of series and parallel composition .",
    "a series parallel graph is a graph @xmath0 such that @xmath24 is a ttspg for some choice of vertices @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",

    "a series parallel linkage is a linkage @xmath6 such that @xmath0 is a series parallel graph .",
    "we note that the operations of parallel composition and series composition extend in an obvious way to linkages - so it makes sense to refer to the parallel composition @xmath42 or the series composition @xmath43 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are linkages rather than graphs .",
    "observe that for a given series parallel graph , there may be many possible choices of terminal vertices",
    ". however , the choice is not completely arbitrary - some pairs of vertices can not be the terminal vertices of a given series parallel graph .",
    "for example , the existence of a subgraph of @xmath0 homeomorphic to @xmath46 implies that @xmath47 is not a ttspg .",
    "there are other possible obstructions . for a more detailed discussion of the possible choices of terminal vertices ,",
    ".    the following lemma will prove useful for our analysis of the connectedness of the moduli space of a series parallel linkage .",
    "recall that a graph @xmath0 is 2-connected if the complement of any vertex is connected .",
    "observe that a series parallel graph is 2-connected if and only if it can not be expressed as a series composition of proper subgraphs .",
    "[ twoconnspglemma ] let @xmath0 be a 2-connected series parallel graph .",

    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be the endpoints of @xmath22 . by an easy modification of the proof of lemma 9 in @xcite , we see that @xmath24 is a ttspg ( note that the hypothesis of 2-connectedness is necessary at this point ) and thus @xmath53 . here",
    "@xmath54 is the subgraph of @xmath0 spanned by all the edges that are not in @xmath22 .",
    "now it also easy to show ( for example , by induction on the number of edges ) that in any series parallel graph that is not itself a path graph , it is possible to find two distinct path subgraphs @xmath49 and @xmath50 with common endpoints and such that no other edges of @xmath0 are incident with any of the internal vertices of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "applying our previous observation to @xmath49 and @xmath50 completes the proof of the lemma .",
    "series parallel graphs are a well studied class of graphs ( see @xcite and @xcite for example ) .",
    "of particular interest to us is the following result of belk and connelly ( see @xcite ) .",

    "observe that in general it is difficult to compute the set of possible distances between a pair of points as we vary over all realisations of a ( possibly non series parallel ) graph .",

    "we conclude this section by showing that the realisability problem for a given series parallel linkage can be answered by looking only at the polygonal sublinkages of the given linkage .",
