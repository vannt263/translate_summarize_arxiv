    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communication systems have recently drawn considerable attention in the area of wireless communications as they promise huge capacity increase and bandwidth efficiency . in the derivation of mimo fading channel capacity , it is usually assumed that the channel state information ( csi ) is known at the receiver , but not at the transmitter , and the transmitter has no knowledge about the channel coefficients .",
    "in fact , channel capacity can be tremendously increased by adding antennas and/or perfect channel estimation at the transmitter .",
    "although increasing the number of antennas improves the capacity of the system , but it noticeably adds to the complexity , the transmitted power and the design and the production expenses at the transmitter . instead of adding more number of antennas , one can realize that even a very limited amount of information about the channel enables the transmitter to estimate the channel and to improve the system capacity and the output bit error - rate .",
    "the channel information can be fed back to the transmitter via a reliable feedback channel . in the literature",
    ", partial feedback refers to a simple feedback whereby simple , but important information of the channel is sent from the receiver to the transmitter . in some of the reported works , partial feedback contains a real phase parameter that is a function of all channel gains .",
    "this partial information allows the transmitter to employ orthogonal space - time block codes ( ostbc ) @xcite . in some others ,",
    "partial information is employed for some forms of antenna selection .",
    "the antenna selection schemes optimally choose a subset of available transmit and/or receive antennas according to some selection criterion , and then process the signals associated with the selected antennas @xcite .",
    "hybrid methods are engaged in some of other reported works in the related literature @xcite . almost in all forms of",
    "closed - loop transmit diversity schemes , i.e. communication systems equipped with partial feedback loop , perfect csi is not achieved and the transmitter only has partial information about the channel . in such cases , transmission structures based on known csi , e.g. optimal beamforming scheme ( obs ) , can not be used . to have a perfect csi estimation , in this paper we propose a simple feedback scheme in which the time varying step - size of a proposed least square adaptive algorithm is sent back to the transmitter .",
    "the transmitter exploits it to recursively estimate the csi .",
    "therefore , having a satisfactory estimate of csi anables the transmitter to employ obs schemes .",
    "the proposed method is made and presented for multiple - input single - output ( miso ) systems .",
    "however , the generalization of the algorithm for mimo systems is easily possible .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s - m ] , the system model is introduced .",
    "simulation examples are given in section  [ s - m ] .",
    "finally , the paper is concluded in section  [ conc ] .",
    "the following theorem has an essential role in our proposed method .",
    "[ th1 ] assume the @xmath0 vector @xmath1 and the sequence @xmath2 are known .",
    "define @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an arbitrary vector .",
    "then , for all real @xmath5 with , we must exchange its position with @xmath6 in relation ( [ em ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 is a decreasing sequence .",
    "hence , the optimum value of @xmath5 to minimizes it is given by @xmath9 in this case we have @xmath10    see appendix [ appendix i ] .    in a miso system with @xmath11 transmit antennas and @xmath12 receive antenna , the @xmath0 channel vector @xmath1 describes the csi .",
    "the @xmath13 component of @xmath1 which is denoted by @xmath14 represents the channel fading coefficient from the @xmath15 transmit antenna to the receive antenna . in many real systems , the csi ( or @xmath1 ) is not fully provided to the transmitter",
    "this is due to some basic limitations like limited capacity of feedback channel or rapid channel variations .",
    "therefore , if the communication system is based on known csi assumption at the transmitter , its estimated value or @xmath16 is alternatively used .",
    "assume @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the euclidean vector norm , @xmath19 is a threshold level and its exact value depends on the system characteristics . now assume that holding @xmath17 , the overall system has a satisfactory performance .",
    "now suppose @xmath20 which may lead to a bad system performance .",
    "the proposed method in this paper starts to come into the role at this moment .",
    "it reduces the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath16 till the point that the corresponding difference comes under @xmath19 .",
    "the details of the proposed method are given based on the theorem  [ th1 ] .",
    "when @xmath20 , the receiver sends a signal to the transmitter indicating that the transmitter should stop data transmission and both parties run the procedure ( [ e1 ] ) in which :    * @xmath2 , a pseudo white @xmath0 training vector sequence , is known at both transmitter and receiver .",
    "* the initial value is @xmath21 . *",
    "the step - size @xmath5 is the quantized value of ( [ e2 ] ) .",
    "note that the right hand side of ( [ e2 ] ) is computed only at the receiver and its quantized value replied to the transmitter via a partial feedback channel .",
    "our suggestion is the @xmath22 bits lloyd quantization method @xcite that we have used in our simulations to send the quantized value of @xmath5 .",
    "if for @xmath23 , @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 , the transmitter chooses @xmath24 as its new value for the channel estimate @xmath16 .",
    "this selection happens by receiving the _ procedure ending signal _ from the receiver and then , the communication system will go back to its normal operation . note that when @xmath2 is a pseudo white sequence ( as it is ) , in almost all iterations we have @xmath26 ( see the recursion ( [ e3 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 is a decreasing sequence and for sufficiently large @xmath28 , we have @xmath29    * the proposed method is independent of system coding and modulation schemes .",
    "hence , it can be useful in all miso systems equipped with partial feedback .",
    "* generalization of the proposed method for mimo systems with @xmath30 receiver antennas ( @xmath31 ) is done by sending @xmath30 step - size values back to the transmitter . in other words , there is one step - size value for each corresponding receiver antenna . *",
    "usually the feedback path is a narrow band channel .",
    "the required bandwidth for feedback is proportional to the csi variations and the processing speed of both transmitter and receiver .",
    "* in order to have a good performance , it is reasonable to have interruption in symbol transmission by the transmitter during the channel estimation phase .",
    "however , as recursion ( [ e3 ] ) shows , in each time instance @xmath32 , the transmitter takes an access to a better channel estimate than that of the time instance @xmath33 .",
    "hence , if the transmitter insists to continuously send its symbol and does not break it ( even when the channel estimate error @xmath34 is over the threshold level @xmath19 ) , it is reasonable that at each time instant @xmath32 , the old channel estimate @xmath35 is replaced by its new one @xmath36 at the transmitter .",
    "this is because the channel squared error is a decreasing sequence .",
    "in our simulation we consider a miso system with flat rayleigh fading channel in two cases . in case one ,",
    "a binary phase shift keying ( bpsk ) modulation and in case two , a quadrature phase shift keying ( qpsk ) modulation are assumed .",
    "for each case we consider two values @xmath37 and @xmath38 which led to four different situations .",
    "figures  [ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] compare the bit error rate ( ber ) versus the transmit power to noise ratio ( tnr ) of the obs ( see appendix  [ obs ] ) .",
    "suboptimal beamforming scheme ( sobs ) is used in which the unknown @xmath1 is replaced by its estimated value @xmath16 which has been given from the proposed method for @xmath39.we assume no delay in feedback channel .",
    "also it is assumed that along the channel estimation procedure , the symbol transmission is interrupted till the time the channel estimate error comes below @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows that with bpsk modulation and @xmath40 , both obs and sobs have the same performance . as it is expected and the histogram diagrams of the step - sizes for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( figures  [ fig4]a and  [ fig4]b ) show , the step - size curve has a normal shape around zero .",
    "in this paper , a full channel estimation procedure for mimo systems is proposed . in the suggested method ,",
    "an iterative adaptive algorithm is executed at both the receiver and the transmitter .",
    "the required step - size value for the transmitter is sent back to the transmitter by means of the feedback channel .",
    "by subtracting @xmath1 from both sides of recursion ( [ e1 ] ) , we have @xmath41 from equation ( [ a1 ] ) , @xmath42 is equal to @xmath43 the left hand side of ( [ a2 ] ) is a decreasing sequence when @xmath5 satisfies inequality ( [ em ] ) and is minimized when @xmath5 is given by ( [ e2 ] ) . from equations ( [ e2 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) ,",
    "we easily get ( [ e3 ] ) .",
    "assuming the known csi , in optimal transmit beamforming scheme , the @xmath13 transmitted signal is multiplied by the normalized conjugate of the @xmath13 channel coefficient . in other words , the beamformer vector @xmath44 is applied at the transmitter , where @xmath45 denotes the conjugate transpose .",
    "it means that if @xmath46 is the transmit symbol , the received signal is @xmath47 or equivalently @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the additive gaussian noise with zero mean and variance @xmath50 .    8 j. k. milleth , k. giridhar , and d. jalihal , `` on channel orthogonalization using space - time block coding with partial feedback , '' , _ ieee trans .  on communications _",
