    "in order to understand the non - perturbative structure of the qcd vacuum , it is important to study various condensates such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 . among various condensates ,",
    "we emphasize the importance of the quark - gluon mixed condensate @xmath12 .",
    "first , the mixed condensate represents a direct correlation between quarks and gluons in the qcd vacuum . in this point",
    ", the mixed condensate differs from @xmath10 and @xmath11 even at the qualitative level .",
    "second , this mixed condensate is another chiral order parameter of the second lowest dimension , because the chirality of the quark flips as @xmath13 third , the mixed condensate plays an important role in various qcd sum rules , especially in the baryons@xcite , the light - heavy mesons  @xcite and the exotic mesons  @xcite . in the qcd sum rules ,",
    "the value @xmath14 has been proposed as a result of the phenomenological analyses  @xcite . however , in spite of the importance of @xmath9 , there was only one preliminary lattice qcd work  , which was performed with very little statistics ( only 5 data ) using a small ( @xmath15 ) and coarse lattice ( @xmath16 ) .    therefore , we present the calculation for @xmath9 in lattice qcd with a larger @xmath17 and finer @xmath18 lattice and with high statistics ( 1600 data ) .",
    "we perform the measurement of @xmath9 as well as @xmath10 in the su(3)@xmath1 lattice at the quenched level , using the kogut - susskind ( ks ) fermion to keep the chiral symmetry .",
    "we generate 100 gauge configurations and pick up 16 points for each configuration to calculate the condensates . with this high statistics of 1600 data for each quark mass , we perform reliable estimate for the ratio @xmath19 at the lattice scale in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "we first emphasize that both of the condensates @xmath10 and @xmath9 work as the chiral order parameter , and therefore to keep chiral symmetry is essential for our study . from this viewpoint",
    ", we adopt the ks - fermion , which can preserve the explicit chiral symmetry for the quark mass @xmath20 , unlike the wilson and the clover fermions .",
    "the action of the ks - fermion is described by spinless grassmann fields @xmath21 and the gauge link - variable @xmath22 $ ] . in the absence of the gauge field , the su(4)@xmath23 quark - spinor field @xmath24 with spinor @xmath25 and flavor @xmath26",
