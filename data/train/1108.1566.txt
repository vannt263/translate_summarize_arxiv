    "locally , the space of projections from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is naturally diffeomorphic to the projections from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "thus , a generic path in @xmath13 can by a compactness argument be reduced to pieces which can be considered to be paths in space of projections from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , that is , a paths in @xmath31 .",
    "all projections do not correspond to points on @xmath13 since we can not let the @xmath32-plane we project from intersect @xmath33 .",

    "following theorem [ projection ] we can study the space of projections from some @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "we examine the affine projections from @xmath37 to @xmath38 which form the grassmannian @xmath31 having dimension @xmath39 .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath5 consists of the subvariety of projections which result in deeper singularities than the mentioned stable singularities .",
    "we will calculate the the dimension of @xmath5 by examining the different kinds of singularities that appears in its top strata and examining their dimensions separately .",
    "note that the stable cases mentioned concerned up to 3 distinct points ending up at the same point under the projection , such that their tangent planes were in general position , and the whitney umbrella , arising from a projection which destroyed the tangent plane for a single point .",
    "the higher singularities we need to consider lie in the closure of the following sets in @xmath13 : projections with quadruple points , projections with a triple point such that the common intersection of two of the tangentplanes lie tangent to the third , projections with a double point such that the tangentplanes are tangent to each other , projections with a double point such that one point lacks a tangent plane , and one has a tangentplane ( whitney - umbrella+plane ) and projections with a single singularity where two whitney umbrellas collide , arising from projecting along a tangentvector with an odd intersection number with the surface ( under a generic projection ) . by lemma [ qlemma ] to lemma [ bklemma ] below , we know that these singularities have codimension at least @xmath35 . any more complicated singularity will necessarily have even higher codimension .",
    "it is also clear that this collection gives all the codimension one singularities , since any singularity must necessarily have some point in the preimage and we have examined the different singularities for @xmath40 points ( and any singularity involving more than 4 points or deeper tangency would have a higher codimension than the one constructed from @xmath2 points ) .",
    "we need to understand the higher singularities in @xmath13 .",
    "the strategy for the examinations of the codimensions of these higher singularities is examine the space of projections admitting at least one such singularity , by first calculating the dimension of the space of points chosen to end up at the singularity , then examining how many vectors are prescribed to project along and finally how to complete these prescribed vectors to a projection , at the end comparing the dimension to @xmath39 . to shorten the proof we omit the detailed calculations concerning genericity of points ( since we are on a veronese embedding in general ) and the defining equations for the subvariety except for the case of two points with coinciding tangent planes where we demonstrate these calculations as well . in some of the situations we should also examine the case of two of the sheets being involved being complex conjugate sheets from the complexification of @xmath4 .",
    "however , this does not change dimensions since choosing one point in the complexification is a @xmath2 dimensional choice from the real point of view , while the other point is by necessity the complex conjugate , that is , the same dimension as choosing @xmath34 real points .",

    "the surface @xmath4 intersect a given m-2-hyperplane in a discrete number of points generically , so choosing points in a line / plane would decrease the dimension by at least @xmath41 respectively . to choose a projection from @xmath18 to @xmath19 we need to complete the three dimensional space generated by the four points to a @xmath42 dimensional space ,",
    "i.e. we need to choose a point from @xmath43 which has dimension @xmath44 .",
    "if the points chosen were situated on the same line / plane we would only be proscribed to use @xmath35 respectively @xmath34 vectors giving a increase in dimension . however , the original choice of of points had a lower dimension , compensating for this increase .",
    "the dimension of the space of projections with at least one quadruple point is then at most @xmath45 and so the space of projections admitting a quadruple point has co - dimension 1 in the space of projections .",

    "the dimension of the space of projections with two points with having the same tangent plane in the image will now be calculated .",
    "we assume that the points are real .",
    "two distinct points in the veronese embedding @xmath24 of @xmath23 do not have a tangent in common as long as @xmath55 , and thus especially the points on our surface do not have a tangent in common . in the case of @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "it is easy to see that there are only a finite number of pairs of points with common tangent plane .",
    "thus , the choice of such points would contribute zero dimensions and completing the projection would result in dimension @xmath58 resulting in co - dimension 3 .",
    "we can ignore such points henceforth and assume that the tangent planes of the points chosen have no nonzero vectors in common .",
    "choosing the two points contributes 4 dimensions . ensuring that they end up at the same point under the projections gives one vector along which we need to project .",
    "the tangent planes will form a 4-dimensional linear subspace from which we need to choose a 2 dimensional subspace to project along to give a common tangent plane . since @xmath59 we get 4 additional dimensions . again",
