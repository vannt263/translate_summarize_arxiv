    "<S> it is argued that radiative decays of scalars @xmath0 can serve as a decisive tool in establishing the nature of the latter . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , predictions for the widths of the radiative decays @xmath1 ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) are given in the framework of the molecule model of the scalars . </S>",
    "<S> finite  </S>",
    "<S> range corrections are discussed in detail for the two - gamma decays of hadronic molecules , with a special attention payed to the interplay of various scales involved in the problem and to the gauge invariance of the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the results are applied to the two - photon decay of the @xmath4 , and the existing experimental data on this decay are argued to support the molecule assignment for the scalar @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> = 11.6pt    the problem of the structure of light scalar mesons is of a fundamental importance for understanding the properties of the entire scalar sector , that is , the sector of states with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , including purely gluonic excitations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the identification of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 mesons , together with the experimental studies of the lightest scalars ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , will allow one to establish the structure of multiplets of scalars and to find the signature of the scalar glueball in the spectrum of physical states . </S>",
    "<S> there are several models for the @xmath5 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can be considered as @xmath8 quark  antiquark states @xcite strongly coupled to the mesonic continuum and thus strongly distorted with the unitarisation process . however , due to the proximity of the @xmath9 threshold , it is natural to assume a considerable admixture of the four  quark component in the wave functions of these mesons , either as a compact four  quark with hidden strangeness @xcite , or as a @xmath9 molecule . </S>",
    "<S> these might be t - channel exchanges to be responsible for the formation of such a molecule @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to establish a test which would allow one to distinguish between these models and thus to reveal the actual nature of these scalars ( in particular , efficient methods to discriminate between the molecule and compact states are strongly needed  for the recent progress see @xcite ) . since years </S>",
    "<S> , radiative decays of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , have been considered as such an experimental tool @xcite . indeed , these decays point to a large @xmath9 component in the scalars wave function @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still a number of shortcomings of this approach should be mentioned . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the radiative decays of the @xmath12 do not allow one to probe the nonstrange component of the scalars , and the contribution of the quark loops is strongly suppressed as compared to the contribution of the meson loops . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the phasespace available in the final state of these decays is limited to a large extend . in the meantime </S>",
    "<S> , another class of radiative decays involving scalars is known  the radiative decays of the scalars themselves : @xmath13 , where the vector in the final state is either massive ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) or massless , that is one deals with a two  photon decay in the latter case . </S>",
    "<S> whatever model of scalars is used , gauge invariance imposes strong constraints on the decay amplitude : @xmath16,\\quad a=\\frac{m^2_v}{m^2},\\quad b=\\frac{m^2_s}{m^2 } , \\label{w1}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the kaon mass and @xmath18 are the four  momenta of the vector particles . </S>",
    "<S> below we shall evaluate the widths of the radiative decays involving the scalars @xmath0 in the molecule assignment for the latter .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     notice that another approach to two  photon decays of molecules is known in the literature , namely the approach based on the formula @xmath19 which is written in analogy with that for the positronium two  photon decay . </S>",
    "<S> although this approach appears quite successful in qed , it has to fail in hadronic physics . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , the w.f . of the kaon molecule is simply not known , so one has to rely on models . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since @xmath20 is very sensitive to the details of the bound  </S>",
    "<S> state formation , the predictions of this approach may vary drastically ( the predictions found in the literature vary by an order of magnitude , from 0.6 kev in @xcite to 6 kev in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , any attempt to evaluate corrections to this leading term results in either gauge invariance or energy conservation law breaking . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the decay amplitude in this approach is usually given as an overlap integral between the molecule w.f . </S>",
    "<S> and the amplitude of the process @xmath21 : @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{m1}\\ ] ] if the amplitude @xmath23 is taken off - shell , then it obviously fails to be gauge  invariant . on the contrary , for the on  shell gauge  </S>",
    "<S> invariant amplitude @xmath23 , kaons carry the energy @xmath24 , rather than @xmath25 , so that energy conservation law is violated .    </S>",
    "<S> the last , but not the least , argument against using the @xmath20-based approach to hadronic processes is that the hierarchy of scales has to be different , namely @xmath26 , in order to validate the given formula with @xmath20 .    finally , we estimate the finite  range corrections to the point - like predictions quoted in tab.[t1 ]  we are interested in the potentially large corrections of order @xmath27 . if the vector in the final state is massive , then the photon in the final state is soft ( @xmath28 ) , and the kinematics of the loop becomes nonrelativistic @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of the finite - range effects amounts to the substitution @xmath29 , with a suitable form of the vertex @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> gauge invariance requires then that the extra momentum dependence coming from the vertex argument should be gauged , that is @xmath31 and the derivative term gives rise to an extra contact diagram with the photon emission from the scalar vertex . </S>",
    "<S> gauge invariance is therefore preserved to order @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> notice however that one should be extremely careful when treating the loop integrals entering the decay amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , although the full amplitude is finite , every individual integral is divergent . </S>",
    "<S> if a cut - off is introduced then to make them finite , gauge invariance may be badly broken and , as a result , wrong conclusions may be deduced ( see , for example , @xcite and explanations in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally one arrives at the conclusion that no corrections of order @xmath27 appear for the point - like predictions @xcite . the same conclusion holds for the two  photon decays of scalars , though it is not straightforward to arrive at this conclusion and one needs to develop a selfconsistent gauge - invariant approach to this decay . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested in @xcite to use an effective kaon interaction lagrangian ( for the neutral - particle exchange , generalisation to the charged - particle exchange being trivial ) written to order @xmath33 : @xmath34 ^ 2 , \\label{lint}\\ ] ] with the coupling constants @xmath35 being of the same order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> this lagrangian is subject to renormalisation to order @xmath33  see @xcite for the details . in the renormalised theory , the kaon propagator and the photon  </S>",
    "<S> emission vertex , which are the dressed quantities , built as solutions of the corresponding field theoretical equations , read : @xmath36 where the ellipsis denotes terms which do not contribute to the decays under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalisation constants for the kaon propagator and for the photon emission vertex coincide due to gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the kaon mass @xmath17 is the renormalised physical mass . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the most important ingredient  the scalar vertex beyond the point - like limit  comes as a solution of the homogenious bethe  </S>",
    "<S> salpeter equation @xcite : @xmath37 this vertex is to be normalised @xcite , which gives for the scalar coupling the formula @xmath38 which coincides with the point - like result ( [ gs0 ] ) as @xmath39 . with the scalar vertex , the dressed kaon propagator , and the dressed photon emission vertex in hand we are in a position to evaluate the width of the scalar two - photon decay up to the order @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude of the process is given by the set of diagrams formally coinciding with those for the point - like vertex , depicted at fig.[3d ] . </S>",
    "<S> notice , however , an important difference : all ingredients are dressed now , and this is a necessary condition to preserve gauge invariance beyond the point - like limit . </S>",
    "<S> the only quantity which should not be dressed is the @xmath40 vertex in the third diagram . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the scalar vertex @xmath41 obeys the bethe  </S>",
    "<S> salpeter equation and thus absorbs all dressing diagrams .    in view of the fact that we deal with an explicitly gauge  invariant amplitude </S>",
    "<S> , we use the trick suggested in @xcite and , in order to extract the amplitude , we read - off the coefficient at the structure @xmath42 in the transition matrix element @xmath43 \\epsilon_{1\\mu}^*\\epsilon_{2\\nu}^*,\\quad p = q_1+q_2 , \\label{vertex}\\ ] ] which is a particular case of ( [ w1 ] ) adapted for the two  photon case . then @xmath44 and , by an explicit calculation </S>",
    "<S> , one can find that @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , no large corrections of order @xmath27 appear for the point - like result ( [ beauty ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude therefore , that finite  range effects give only moderate corrections to the point - like predictions ( of order @xmath46 in the amplitude ) , provided they are included in a self - consistent and gauge - invariant way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to the point - like results presented in tab.1 as to the molecule model predictions for the radiative decays involving scalars . for the sake of comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we quote in tab.[t1 ] the results of calculations in the quark  antiquark assignment for the scalars , which can be obtained with the help of the results of @xcite . from tab.1 one </S>",
    "<S> can conclude that experimental data are well described in the molecule assignment for the scalars ( a recent result by belle @xcite @xmath47 kev gives an even better coincidence with the point - like prediction ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , predictions for the radiative decays of scalars with massive vectors in the final state demonstrate a clear hierarchy , depending on the assignment prescribed to the scalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> this makes these decays an extremely promising tool in establishing the nature of the @xmath0 . </S>"
