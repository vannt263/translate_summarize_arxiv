    "if the absorbing source is a pure absorber  i.e. , has a zero source function  than the increase in line absorption at these phases indicates an increase in covering factor of the continuum ( the inner disk ) .",
    "none of obs .  1  obs .",
    "3 had full orbital phase coverage and the orbital phases observed varied , with incomplete overlap between observations . as a result , we can not precisely determine the orbital range over which the increase in the line absorption is seen .",
    "for the data in hand , however , the excess line absorption is only seen in spectra obtained after orbital phase 0.53 and before phase 0.79 .",
    "the behavior of the @xmath251032,1038 doublet is different from the other absorption lines in the fuv outburst spectra of u  gem .",

    ". the line shapes vary dramatically from spectrum to spectrum ; figure  [ fig_o6 ] shows , for example , the spectra from obs .  3 .",
    "in many spectra , the lines develop what appears to be narrow ( @xmath1100  km  s@xmath2 ) , blueshifted ( @xmath28  km  s@xmath2 ) dips superimposed on the broader absorption .",
    "1 shows such dips in 4 of its 5 spectra .",

    "many of the spectra show two dips in each line .",
    "@xmath171038    is coincident with two interstellar lines , but leaving aside distortions in its line shape caused by the interstellar lines , both @xmath171032    and @xmath171038    have the same profile in any given spectrum .",
    "second , as mentioned previously , 1038    is the only line in the spectrum that shows any sign of an emission feature , in the form of a weak bump to the red of the absorption component of the line .",
    "the strength of the emission feature can vary from spectrum to spectrum : contrast , for example , the size of the feature in the phase 0.10  0.12 spectrum versus that of phase 0.53  0.56 in figure  [ fig_o6 ] .",
    "there is no correlation in the strength of the red emission feature with orbital phase ( although it is weakest in the two obs .  1 and obs .  3 spectra acquired at orbital phase 0.5 ) , nor is its strength correlated with the shape of the absorption component of the line .",

    "we divided the hst observations into six spectra of 465 sec integration time each to replicate the time resolution of our obs .  1  obs .  3 spectra .",
    "the spectra of @xmath171641    at orbital phases 0.64  0.67 and 0.93  0.96 are shown in figure  [ fig_hst ] . like the absorption lines in the fuse obs .  1  obs",

    "the absorption line is relatively shallow in the first spectrum ( @xmath29 = 0.56 ) , but it deepens steadily in subsequent spectra , reaching its deepest level in the @xmath29 = 0.655 spectrum shown . between @xmath29 = 0.56 to @xmath29 = 0.655 , the absorption line shifts to the red by 260  km  s@xmath2 , a shift well in excess of the wd s radial orbital velocity motion . the penultimate spectrum ( @xmath29 = 0.68 ) also shows a relatively deep absorption line , but by @xmath29 = 0.945 the absorption component of @xmath171641    has reverted to the shallow depth seen at @xmath29 = 0.56 .",
    "the increase in the central depth and velocity of the @xmath30    absorption line during orbital phases 0.58  0.70 shows that the orbital variability in line absorption seen in our fuse spectra is not unique to the 2000 march outburst of u  gem : the 1995 september outburst observed by hst shows a similar variability .",
    "we also examined the @xmath251238,1242    ghrs spectra , which were acquired over orbital phases 0.79  0.94 .",

    "was not observed at the orbital phases at which absorption line depth changes are seen in the fuse spectra , however .",
    "we also note that while the hst spectra show no @xmath2512931303    features , these observations were acquired between phases 0.1  0.3 , when absorption was also absent from the fuse spectra ; thus , their absence from the hst spectra may result from the orbital phase of observation , rather than a true absence of during any portion of that outburst .",
    "one interesting feature of the @xmath30    orbital variability is that the absorption line core terminates roughly at the level of the continuum in phases 0.55  0.58 and 0.90  0.92 , but drops well below the continuum in phases 0.58  0.70 .",
    "in contrast , the absorption is much deeper than the continuum throughout its observation .",
    "finally , unlike in the fuse spectra , where most of the absorption lines become stronger as well as deeper at orbital phases 0.53  0.79 , the @xmath171641    absorption component narrows as it deepens , so that the @xmath29 = 0.56 and 0.945 spectra actually show the largest ews and absorption line fluxes . whether this change in the fwhm in @xmath30    is",
    "secular or related to the increased line depth is unclear given the limited data set .",
    "as noted in  [ sec_morph ] , the spectra of u  gem in obs .  4 differ from those of obs .",

    "the model spectra covered a range of wd temperatures from 20,000  k @xmath32 95,000  k , and gravities from 7.5 @xmath33 9.5 .",
    "we tested wd rotation rates of 100  km  s@xmath2 and 200  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "we adopted a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath20 = ( see appendix  [ sec_cog ] ) and tested reddening values of e(b  v ) = 0 and 0.03 , according to the reddening law of @xcite .",
    "for the metal lines , we tested both solar abundances and the abundances from @xcite : a c abundance of 0.1 solar , si and al abundances of 0.4 solar , and a n abundance of 4 times solar .",
    "the model spectra were fitted to the data by least - squares minimization .",
    "we masked out the ly@xmath34 airglow and the absorption lines ; the latter are not expected to originate on the wd unless its temperature is much higher than anticipated for u  gem .",
    "finally , since the model spectra are at zero velocity , we shifted the obs .  4 spectrum by @xmath35  km  s@xmath2 before fitting to remove the recessional velocity of the wd @xcite .",
    "the best - fit single - temperature wd model for these parameters is shown as the solid line in figure  [ fig_wd ] .",
    "the temperature of the wd is 43,410  k , the gravity is @xmath36 , the wd rotation rate is 200  km  s@xmath2 , and the metal abundances are solar . for the model shown , the reddening is e(b  v ) = 0.03 . the wd model is a good qualitative ( though not statistical : @xmath37 = 5.67 ) fit to the spectrum .",
    "the shapes of the continuum and the absorption lines are reasonably well reproduced by the model .",
    "the model also reproduces the and metal lines well .",
    "virtually all of the lines that are present in the observed spectrum are also present in the model , except the blend at @xmath17923  and the and doublets .",
    "the strengths of the lines are mostly well reproduced .",
    "the most glaring exceptions are @xmath17990   , @xmath17992   , and the triplet at 1110   , all of which are too weak in the model to match the observations . on the other side ,",
    "the model predicts strong lines of @xmath171002,1003    and @xmath171010,1165    that are not seen in the data and overpredicts the strengths of @xmath171125.6    and @xmath171169   .",
    "the normalization of the model fits is a measure of the solid angle of the wd and can be combined with the distance to give the wd radius . at the distance of u  gem ,",
    "96 pc , our normalization gives a wd radius of @xmath38  cm .",
    "this radius is consistent within uncertainties in flux calibration with that found by @xcite : for the 96  pc distance , their model normalization gives @xmath39 = @xmath40  cm .",
    "assuming a standard wd mass - radius relation @xcite , our radius indicates a wd mass of 1.08  , which is close to the mass reported by @xcite and @xcite , @xmath411.1  ( or 1.12  for @xmath19 ) .",
    "both the temperature and the normalization of the single - temperature model are largely impervious to variations in the assumed wd rotation rate , metal abundances , or neutral hydrogen column density : there was @xmath61000  k variation in the wd temperature as these values were varied , and a @xmath65% change in the normalization ( or @xmath32.5% change in the wd radius ) .",
    "this is not surprising , since the fit is largely set by the fluxes and the shape of the continuum .",
    "the model parameters are sensitive to the reddening , however . for zero reddening ,",
    "the wd temperature decreases by a small amount , to 41,750  k , but the normalization drops by 20% , or an 11% decrease in the wd radius .",
    "however , the @xmath37 only increases from 5.65 to 5.75 and the qualitative fit is essentially unchanged .",
    "our models are subject to such uncertainties because the total wavelength coverage of the fuse spectrum is small .",
    "previous studies of the wd in u  gem @xcite have found evidence of a second temperature component , or `` belt '' on the wd surface . given the importance of two - component models to previous fits to the wd spectrum in u  gem , we tested the effects of adding a second temperature component to out wd models .",
    "the best - fit two - component model , using the same model parameters discussed above for the single temperature case , is shown as the dotted line in figure  [ fig_wd ] .",
    "it has @xmath36 , @xmath42 = 35,000  k and @xmath43 = 57,920  k. a reddening of e(b  v ) = 0 gives a slightly better statistical fit in this case .",
    "the ratio of the normalizations of the two components indicates that the hot component covers some @xmath140% of the wd surface in projected area .",
    "the two - component model is a statistical improvement in the fit quality : the reduced @xmath21 declines from 5.67 to 5.18 .",
    "this improvement is primarily manifested as a better fit to the observed spectrum for @xmath6960   . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the two - component model is very similar to the single - temperature case .",
    "the relative size and temperature of the hot component is not well constrained by our fits . by making small changes to the model parameters , we found that the temperature of the hot component could vary from 55,000  k to 70,000  k without significantly changing the fit to the data .",
    "changes in temperature of the second component are offset by changes in the size of the hot region , from a minimum of 13% to the 40% noted above .    for the models shown in figure  [ fig_wd ] , we assumed solar metal abundances .",
    "we also tested models in which the metal abundances were varied .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , modelling separate and independent observations of u  gem in quiescence , found c and si to have sub - solar abundances and ( in the latter study ) n to be supersolar , while the other metals had normal abundances .",
    "we tested the values found by @xcite , setting c to 0.1 solar , n to 4 times solar , and si to 0.4 solar .",
    "since these abundances are based on fits to lines in the hst wavelength range , our fuse observations should be well suited to provide an independent check on their values .",
    "for the elements in question , our models indicate results consistent with those found by the previous studies .    for carbon ,",
    "the solar abundance models shown in figure  [ fig_wd ] fit the strong @xmath171186    and the @xmath17977  lines moderately well . however , most of the other c lines suggest lower abundances . specifically , there are many c lines in the solar abundance model spectrum that are not present in the data , and other c lines in the data are strongly overpredicted by a solar abundance model .",
    "for a 0.1 solar c abundance , the fits to the weaker c lines in the spectrum are vastly improved : lines such as @xmath171066   , @xmath171125    and @xmath171169    are well fit by the 0.1 solar model and the c lines not present in the data disappear from the models . since the @xmath171186    and the @xmath17977    lines are saturated , they are not as affected by the abundance . in",
    "particularly , the strongest line , @xmath171186   , is still fairly well fit , but is either slightly too shallow or too narrow , depending on the wd rotation rate adopted .",
    "the resonance line at @xmath17977   , already slightly too weak at solar abundance , becomes even weaker .",
    "@xcite found nitrogen to be 4 times solar .",

    ", the resonance line , @xmath17990   , is much too weak , as is @xmath17955   . at an abundance",
    "4 times solar , both lines are much better fit ; if anything , they remain slightly too weak .",
    "@xmath17980   , though not poorly fit at solar abundance , is also better fit at 4 times solar .",
    "the fits to these lines appear to confirm the super - solar n abundance found by long & gilliland .",
    "there are some residual peculiarities in the n line fits , however .",
    "the blend does nt appear in any of our models , at any abundance , despite being a strong feature in the data ( and being present in the model line list ) . also , @xmath171002   , @xmath171003   , and @xmath171006    are too strong in both the solar and super - solar models .",
    "the overall fit to the n line spectrum , however , in obs .  4 is improved by assuming a super - solar n abundance .",

    "we note that @xmath171067    appears too strong at solar abundances , but it is blended with the aforementioned @xmath171066    line , and a reduction of the c abundance from solar improves the fit to this feature without requiring an adjustment to the si abundance . also , the triplet , @xmath171108     @xmath171113   , is too weak in both the 0.4 solar and solar models .",

    "this said we were unable to accurately determine self - consistent abundance values that fit every , or almost every , line of a given element .",

    ", we have used lte models ; one might hope that non - lte modelling and/or very careful attention to the assumed oscillator strengths could improve the results .",
    "we have not pursued this here , in part due the fact that u gem may not have been completely in quiescence at the time of our obs .  4 ; disk or boundary layer material associated with the outburst may be affecting the line strengths .",
    "possible surface temperature variations on the wd associated with the outburst could also be affecting the fits .",
    "detailed , non - lte modelling of a high quality fuv spectrum in full quiescence is probably a pre - requisite for a more detailed analysis of this spectrum . that will be interesting of course , since the photospheric abundances may change during the inter - outburst interval due to gravitational settling in the atmosphere if the accretion rate is sufficiently low or concentrated on a small part of the wd .",

    "the doublet ratio indicates that the lines are also optically thick . using the ghrs observations of u  gem ( long & gilliland 1999 ) , we determined the column depth of the absorption , and obtained @xmath46 = 15.3 , with a covering fraction of 0.65 . ]    we also checked the obs .  4 data to see if the increase in line absorption during orbital phases 0.53  0.79 seen in obs .",
    "1  obs.3 is also seen in obs .",
    "4 . to do so , we averaged all obs .  4 data acquired during phases 0.53  0.79 and all data acquired at other orbital phases , and examined a difference spectrum of the two averages .",
    "the difference showed no change in the obs .  4 spectrum between the two parts of the orbit .",
    "there was no sign of increased absorption underlying the wd features , nor was there any change in the shapes or strengths of the and lines , indicating that the orbital phase - dependent variations in line absorption seen on outburst plateau is not observed in late outburst decline .",
    "during the peak and plateau phase of the outburst , the shapes of the fuse spectra were very similar and the flux declined by only @xmath122% overall . based on our accretion disk models of u  gem , @xmath190% of the flux at 1000    arises from disk radii @xmath61@xmath47  cm , or @xmath620 wd radii .",
    "thus , the similarity of the spectra from the three plateau observations is strong evidence that the structure of the inner accretion disk was relatively stable and that the effective size of the emitting region did not decline by more than about 20%  25% .",
    "indeed , the flux decline we observed was similar to that observed by euve during a similar outburst @xcite . in both outbursts , the uv flux dropped earlier than the optical flux , suggesting that the declines were inside - out .",
    "our disk model fits to the fuv spectra of u  gem on the outburst plateau provide qualitatively reasonable determinations of for the mass accretion rate . the accretion disk models",
    "successfully reproduce the overall shape of much of the fuv continuum , although the model under - predicts the observed continuum @xmath6960   .",
    "given our elementary understanding of accretion disk atmospheres , it is not clear whether the latter discrepancy is due to a limitation in the disk models or to the addition of a second continuum component , such as the boundary layer , to the light curve at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "interestingly , there is reasonably good agreement between the accretion rate we derive and the rates that have been derived at somewhat longer wavelengths using iue and hst @xcite .",
    "our own view , based on studies of other dwarf novae , is that this is somewhat fortuitous , mainly because studies of other dn and novalike cvs have shown that the spectra of many systems with high-@xmath7 depart from the predictions of synthetic spectra created from summed stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "uv spectra of dn in outburst in the range accessible to iue and hst usually contain features due to resonance lines , mainly of , and .",
    "these lines are usually characterized by larger velocity widths , blue - shifted absorption centroids , and , in lower inclination systems and especially for , red emission wings .",
    "such lines are interpreted as resonant scattering in a wind driven from the inner portions of the disk .",
    "this interpretation arises naturally from the line shapes of typical systems , which for in particular resemble the p  cygni profiles produced in o star winds ; from the fact that even when p  cygni emission wings are absent the lines are broad and blueshifted ; from blue - edge velocities of up to 5000  km  s@xmath2 , which are similar to the escape velocity from the wd ; and from the persistence and shape of the line emission during the eclipses of highly inclined systems ( see crdova  1995 and drew  1997 for reviews ) .",
    "this interpretation has been supported by detailed comparison of line shapes to those predicted based on radiative transfer codes @xcite .",
    "however , none of these characteristics is seen in the lines in u gem , and as a result it is quite clear that a `` standard '' wind does not create the fuv line structure . in particular , all of the fuv lines are relatively narrow with fwhm @xmath48  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is also clear that the lines do not originate directly from the disk photosphere , since the line features in our steady - state disk models are broad ( see figure  [ fig_d1_disk ] ) .",
    "the reason that steady - state disk models can not produce these lines is simple : the line - of - sight velocities in inner disk where the bulk of the fuv radiation is produced are simply too high to produce narrow lines .",
    "the line spectrum of u gem in outburst is fairly unusual for a dn in outburst in the iue / hst range , but there are relatively few spectra of cvs covering the fuv range . the largest collection of publicly available ,",
    "high spectral resolution fuv spectra of cvs are those obtained with orfeus .",
    "( such fuse observations are limited at present ) .",
    "we downloaded spectra obtained by the berkeley extreme and far - uv spectrometer ( befs ) on orfeus @xcite .",
    "orfeus spectra of the novalike cvs v3885  sgr and ix  vel , and of the dn z  cam ( in standstill ) and vw  hyi ( in outburst ) are shown in figure  [ fig_orfeus ] . to our knowledge , these spectra are previously unpublished .",
    "for comparison , the fluxes in the orfeus spectra were rescaled so that their mean 900  1100    fluxes are equivalent to the mean flux in the same wavelength range of our obs.1 time - averaged spectrum , which is also shown in each frame of figure  [ fig_orfeus ] .    in fact , we see that the fuv lines and line widths in u  gem are not that unusual .",
    "specifically , the fuv spectra of v3885  sgr and z  cam are clearly quite similar to the outburst spectrum of u  gem .",
    "their continuum shapes are comparable , and the absorption line transitions observed and their widths and velocities are virtually identical .",
    "this is true despite the fact that iue and hut spectra of v3885  sgr and z  cam show p cygni - like profiles ( see , e.g. , prinja & rosen 1995 ) .",
    "narrow lines are not universal in the fuv , however .",
    "the ix  vel spectrum shows much broader absorption features than are seen in u  gem , and its metal lines are blueshifted .",
    "the vw  hyi spectrum shows strong , broad absorption and little else .",
    "all of the cvs except vw  hyi , which lies below the period gap , have similar ( 4.25 hr  6.95 hr ) orbital periods to u  gem and all ( except possibly v3885  sgr ) have inclinations within 10@xmath49 of u  gem ( 57@xmath49  60@xmath49 ; ritter & kolb 1998 ) .",
    "thus , while high velocity lines can be seen in some spectra , we conclude that , among fuv spectra of cvs , u  gem is not a pathological case .    we are left then with the question : if the fuv lines in u  gem and similar systems are created neither by a fast wind nor by the disk photosphere , where does the absorption arise ?",
    "we have a number of clues .",
    "first , the lines encompass a large range in ionization potential , and many of the lines arise from excited lower states ( see table  [ tab_ew ] ) with excitation energies of typically 5  15  ev .",
    "this suggests high plasma density or high radiation density , so that the lower levels will be excited .",
    "( in lte , for example , at 25,000  k , the relative population of an excited state with an excitation energy of 10  ev is still @xmath11% . ) indeed , all of the lines seen in the outburst spectra are also seen in the obs .",
    "4 spectrum that we are confident is dominated by radiation from a wd photosphere .",
    "second , the lines have low radial velocities ( @xmath3700  km  s@xmath2 ) with respect to the wd , which rules out an inner disk origin , and none of the absorption lines are dark in their lines centers , which suggests that the absorbing region only partially covers the inner accretion disk .",
    "finally , while the absorption lines are present at all orbital phases , the depths of the low ionization state lines vary with phase and are deepest between phases 0.53 and 0.79 ; in the same part of the orbit , most of the lines are redshifted by @xmath1450  km  s@xmath2 with respect to the wd .",
    "the relatively dense , low velocity absorption spectrum suggests an outer accretion disk chromosphere origin .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite , who found that u  gem s accretion disk in outburst shows considerable vertical extent , with the hydrogen column density along the line of sight reaching up to @xmath50  @xmath51 .",
    "the orbital variability in the fuse spectra suggests that the absorption region is also linked to the source of the x - ray and euv dips seen in u  gem .",
    "the increase in line absorption seen in the fuse ( and archival hst ) spectra occurs at approximately the same orbital phases at which x - ray and euv absorption dips occur in u  gem @xcite .",
    "most of the observations of dips have been made during outburst , but @xcite also observed orbital dips in quiescence with asca .",
    "similar phenomena are observed in a group of low mass x - ray binaries , the so - called x - ray `` dippers '' .",
    "( see white , nagase , & parmar 1995 for a review of these systems . )",
    "it is generally believed that the dips in x - ray binaries and analogous dips in cvs are due to a vertical extension of the accretion disk created by the interaction between the disk and the mass accretion stream @xcite .",
    "two flavors of models of the phenomenon exist . in the first",
    ", the response of the disk is to bulge  that is , to have a different scale heights  at various azimuths .",
    "for example , @xcite carried out three - dimensional calculations that show bulges at positions that will partially occult the disk near phase 0.8 , with less prominent bulges at phase 0.2 and 0.5 .",
    "alternate models were developed by frank , king & lasota ( 1987 ) and @xcite , who proposed that the dips could be accounted for by stream material skating over the edge of the accretion disk and piling up at the co - rotation radius .",
    "@xcite argued that the interaction between new and old material results in a general thickening of the disk at the co - rotation radius , resulting in prominent dips between orbital phases 0.3 and 0.8 .",
    "more recent calculations by @xcite are beginning to synthesize the bulge and stream extremes .",
    "they indicate that the nature of the flow depends , as one might expect , on the efficiency of cooling of the stream at the point where the stream encounters the disk . at low accretion rates ,",
    "the stream flows more or less ballistically to the co - rotation radius ; at higher rates , the stream is disrupted , `` splashes '' , near the disk rim and appears as a bulge with a phase dependence reminiscent of the predictions of @xcite .    in terms of general character ,",
    "our plateau absorption spectra appear consistent with vertically extended absorbing material interacting with some kind of stream overflow .",
    "in fact , in their analysis of the asca observations of u  gem , @xcite noted that such a vertically extended stream , in addition to producing x - ray dips , should also produce very optically thick absorption lines of low ionization metals with line widths of a few hundred km  s@xmath2 , much as we observe with fuse .",
    "the increase in line absorption and redshift at orbital phases 0.55  0.71 in the fuse spectra is , in this picture , caused by the presence of additional , in - flowing material as the disk - stream interaction region moves into our line of sight .",
    "because we observe absorption lines at every orbital phase , however , the line absorption region can not be narrowly confined to the disk - stream interaction region , but rather indicates an azimuthally - varying disk chromosphere , disturbed by the stream overflow .",
    "ideally , one would at this point develop a detailed model of the ionization structure of and radiation flow through such a stream interaction region of the disk .",
    "we do not have in hand a detailed picture of the density structure of this region , nor do we have in hand the 3-d radiative transfer code that would be required .",
    "we do , however , possess a 2-d monte - carlo code @xcite that was simple to modify so that it could handle an accretion disk chromosphere .",
    "our goal was limited to determining the location and velocity of absorbing material that can produce narrow absorption lines at low velocity ; we did not try to find the ionization structure of the material or fit the full spectrum simultaneously .",
    "we created a disk chromosphere that rotates at the keplerian velocity of the underlying disk , and ran pure absorption ( i.e. , zero source function ) calculations through that chromosphere , with the inner accretion disk continuum discussed above as input , to determine the radial extent and velocity of the region .",
    "we found two main results .",
    "first , as expected , the absorbing material must have a mean velocity with respect to the line of sight that is nearly zero .",
    "any outflow component to the gas resulted in lines that were too heavily blueshifted .",
    "second , we were able to produce absorption lines similar in velocity , shape , and depth to those observed when the absorbing gas was restricted to outer disk radii , @xmath52  cm ",
    "@xmath53  cm ( @xmath120  60  r@xmath54 ) .",
    "as many of the absorption lines are optically thick , the extent of the absorbing region , i.e. its covering factor , was more important to matching the absorption lines than the density .",
    "the model chromosphere has a vertical scale height of 5@xmath55  cm , much greater than the scale height of disk photosphere , and a base density of @xmath56  @xmath57 . at a disk radius of and an inclination angle of 67@xmath49",
    ", the line of sight to the wd has a height above the disk of , so this is material that is elevated considerably above the disk photosphere .",
    "the parameters of our simple model for the fuv absorbing region are consistent with the location of the x - ray dip absorbing material . the vertical scale height of the fuv absorbing material is @xmath10.2  @xmath58 ( where @xmath59 is the radial distance to the wd ) ; long et al .",
    "1996 gave a scale height of 0.42@xmath59 for the x - ray / euv absorber .",
    "the inner radius of the absorbing region in our model ( 10@xmath60  cm ) is also quite close to the projected circularization radius of the mass stream for u  gem , 1.1@xmath47  cm , and could therefore coincide with the stream overflow radii @xcite .",
    "the outer radius in our model is 3@xmath47  cm .",
    "this is smaller than the outer radius of the accretion disk in quiescence ( @xmath61 cm ; marsh et al .",
    "1990 ) and thus is perhaps less consistent with an outer disk bulge picture , though a more sophisticated model is clearly necessary to demonstrate this in earnest .",
    "the absorption lines behave differently from the other lines in the fuv spectrum . in particular , they show signatures of a wind . in obs",
    ".  1  obs .  3",
    ", @xmath171038    has apparent weak emission to the red of its blueshifted absorption component .",
    "another aspect of the doublet that marks it out as different from the other absorption features is the appearance in the doublet lines of narrow absorption dips at a blueshift of @xmath1500 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this lends weight to the identification of the profiles as partially or mainly wind - formed in that similar blueshifted absorption dips have also been found in very clearly wind - formed line profiles in hst / stis spectra of the non - magnetic novalike variables ix  vel and v3885  sgr ( hartley et al , in preparation ; see also mauche 1991 , prinja & rosen 1995 ) . as here , the narrow absorption dips seen in ix  vel and v3885  sgr show some ew modulation ( e.g. they are seen to disappear over some minutes in  @xmath171397 in ix  vel s spectrum ) , along with only slight variation of blueshift .",
    "the origin of these dips is as yet quite unclear .",
    "we can comment on what they are not : their persistence at essentially the same blueshift , when present , tends to rule out the models that are employed to explain the moving `` dacs '' ( discrete absorption components ) in o star winds ( see e.g. prinja et al 1992 and cranmer & owocki 1996 ) .",
    "instead , we need a model that invokes a structure in the disk and/or wind that is nearly azimuthally symmetric and is able to induce a pile - up of outflowing o@xmath62 ions at the observed @xmath1500 km  s@xmath2 blueshift",
    ".    if a fast wind exists in u  gem , as the line profiles suggest , it must be tenuous enough or ionized to the point where it has little effect on the spectrum in the fuv , except for a weak signature of outflow in the highest excitation fuv transition .",
    "the degree of ionization may be the key difference between u  gem and other systems , since u  gem is known to have a luminous boundary layer during outburst @xcite .",
    "further evidence of the wind has to be sought in the euv domain where , indeed , very highly ionized transitions are seen in emission that could originate in the wind @xcite .",
    "given the mass accretion rate estimate to hand and a figure for the white dwarf radius , we may estimate the ratio @xmath63 between the accretion and eddington luminosities for u  gem .",
    "using respectively @xmath64  yr@xmath2 ( this paper ) and r@xmath65 cm ( long & gilliland 1999 ) , we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "if the wind is driven just by radiation pressure , this value of @xmath67 implies , at best , a mass loss rate in the region of @xmath68  yr@xmath2 ( deduced from the plot of wind mass loss rate against @xmath67 in drew & proga 2000 , see also proga 1999 ) . by the standards of high - state non - magnetic cv ,",
    "this is a weak wind ",
    "mass loss rates are usually estimated to be an order of magnitude higher ( drew 1997 ) . in the presence of u  gem s strong euv continuum",
    ", we should not be surprised such a wind is highly ionized .",
    "thus , while in other high state systems , with denser , less well - ionized winds and , yet , similar mass accretion rates to u  gem , radiation pressure as a driver of outflows may be insufficient to complete account for the flow ( e.g. , ix  vel , hartley et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , our outburst spectra of u gem are compatible with mass loss driven mainly by radiation pressure .",
    "4 was obtained two days before the end of the optical outburst . in the fuv ,",
    "the accretion disk had already faded , revealing the white dwarf ; a model wd spectrum with t@xmath69  k provides a good qualitative fit to the obs .",
    "4 spectrum .",
    "previous uv observations of u  gem obtained early and late in its quiescent interval have shown that the wd cools between outbursts @xcite .",
    "the wd flux drops 30% ( at 1450   ) from early quiescence to late quiescence @xcite , and models typically indicate a wd temperature of 38,000  k soon after outburst and 30,000  k several hundred days later @xcite .",
    "the fluxes observed in obs .",
    "4 are 30% higher again ( at 1000   ) than those seen in a hut spectrum of u  gem obtained 11 days after then end of an outburst , indicating that the wd luminosity in late outburst is larger still than its luminosity in early quiescence .",
    "moreover , the drop in flux from late outburst to early quiescence is comparable to the decline in flux during the quiescent interval .    in modelling the hut spectrum of u  gem",
    ", @xcite found that a single - temperature wd model provided a poor fit to the spectrum below 970   .",
    "the quality of the fit at the bluest wavelengths was improved by the addition of a second component on the wd , a 56,600  k source occupying @xmath115% of the wd surface .",
    "more important , the additional component resolved an inconsistency between the observed flux decline during quiescence and the decrease in the wd temperatures of the quiescent models : an 8000  k drop in the temperature of the entire wd ( from 38,000  k to 30,000  k ) would cause the observed flux to drop by over a factor of two , not just 30% as observed , but the cooling of 15% of the wd from 57,000  k to 30,000  k is consistent with the observed flux decline .",
    "indeed , virtually all of the model fits to quiescent observations of u  gem are consistent with the bulk of the wd having a constant or near - constant temperature while a fraction of the wd  heated by the outburst  cools during quiescence @xcite .",
    "our single - temperature wd model indicates a temperature of 43,000  k. a decline in the bulk wd temperature from 43,000  k in late outburst to 38,000  k in early quiescence implies a decrease in flux at 1050  of 35% , which matches the observed flux decline within the flux calibration uncertainties of both spectra .",
    "therefore , a second temperature component is not required to explain the drop in flux from that seen in obs .",
    "4 to those of early quiescent observations of u  gem .",
    "previous observations have indicated the likely presence of a belt on the wd , however , and if a hot belt is a consequence of the elevated accretion during outburst , we would expect the belt to also be present during obs .  4 .",
    "our two - temperature wd model is , in fact , a statistical and qualitative improvement over the single temperature fit to the obs .  4 spectrum .",
    "the two models are quite similar at longer wavelengths , but the addition of a second component improves the fit to the spectrum at the shortest wavelengths ( @xmath6960   ) , as was also true of fits to the hut post - outburst spectrum .",
    "our observations indicate that the wd is more luminous in late outburst than in early quiescence and that the addition of a second temperature component on the wd improves the model fit to obs.4 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not use these results to draw firm conclusions about changes in temperatures across the wd after an outburst , both because the effects we are trying to measure are at the margin of what is possible after allowing for errors in the cross - calibration of the instrumentation involved , and because there is no guarantee that the wd behaved identically in the various outbursts that have been observed ( see , for example , sion et al .",
    "1998 ) . the question of whether all or part of the wd cools after outburst bears directly on models of the cooling source . if the heating of the wd during outburst is caused by spin - up of its surface layers , a multi - component temperature distribution on the wd in the form of a belt is likely , as the accreted material preferentially boosts kinetic energies near the wd equator @xcite . ongoing accretion through the disk may also support a wd belt in quiescence @xcite .",
    "other models  such as radiative heating of the wd during the outburst @xcite , compressional heating of the wd layers by the weight of accreted material @xcite , or quiescent accretion via a disk corona @xcite  may allow a single - temperature wd .",
    "a series of targeted observations of u  gem throughout a full quiescent interval using hst or fuse will be needed to resolve uncertainties concerning the response of the bulk of the wd and the wd belt to the outburst .",
    "the and absorption lines that are present in the obs 4 . spectrum do not arise naturally in the wd photosphere , unless the temperature of the wd is much higher than we have estimated .",
    "the smooth line profiles bear no resemblance to the wind - formed lines seen on outburst plateau . also interesting",
    "is the fact that none of these lines ( indeed , none of the lines in the obs .  4 spectrum )",
    "show variability , orbital or otherwise .",
    "the x - ray dips with which the outburst plateau absorption spectrum is associated persist into quiescence @xcite , but no associated orbital variation is seen in obs .",
    "these lines are not unique to late outburst , however , as was also observed in the hut quiescent spectra , and both the hut and hst quiescent spectra show absorption .",
    "we derived column densities for the lines of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for , , and , respectively .",
    "the associated h column densities , assuming close to solar abundances , for all three lines range is about @xmath73 .",
    "( this is close to that the column density we have derived for the interstellar column density to u gem , but that is coincidental since these are not the dominant stages of these ions in the ism . )",
    "if accretion onto the wd in quiescence occurs through some kind of coronal , or siphon flow , such as suggested by @xcite , it is possible that these high excitation absorption lines arise in the transition region between the hot x - ray emitting gas and the wd photosphere . if this is the case , it is possible to estimate the density @xmath74 and the length scale @xmath75 from the quiescent accretion luminosity and the column densities .",
    "specifically , and concentrating on @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total emissivity in the region , and @xmath75 has been left on both sides of the equation for clarity . if we assume that the 43,000  k wd temperature we derive our models of obs .  4 represent excess heating from accretion over the 30,000  k quiescent temperature of the wd , we obtain an excess luminosity of @xmath78  ergs  s@xmath2 and a reasonable accretion rate @xmath79  g  s@xmath2 . in coronal equilibrium , the relative abundance of peaks at @xmath80  k and the corresponding emissivity is @xmath81  ergs  s@xmath2  @xmath82 @xcite , and this suggests a density of @xmath83 in the transition region between the hot plasma and the wd photosphere . since we know the column density ( @xmath84 ) to be @xmath85",
    ", the thickness of the region is about 20 km .",
    "this is within an order of magnitude of the scale height for a @xmath86 component to the upper atmosphere of a log g=8 star .",
    "finally , one of the more interesting recent discoveries from analyses of hst uv spectra of u  gem in quiescence has been that sub - solar carbon abundances and super - solar nitrogen abundances are required in the photosphere of the wd .",
    "( the models also indicate slightly sub - solar silicon and aluminum abundances ; sion et al .",
    "1998 , long & gilliland 1999 ) .",
    "such an abundance pattern is indicative of a history of cno processing in the surface wd material .",
    "intriguingly , @xcite find that the co absorption lines in their nir spectra of u  gem are also weaker than expected for the mass donor star spectral type , which may confirm that the material accreted onto the wd consists of cno processed material , perhaps deposited on the mass donor star during an previous nova explosion in the binary @xcite . in our models ,",
    "the overall c and n absorption spectra are consistent with a sub - solar abundance for the former and a super - solar abundance for the latter as found by fits to the hst spectra .",

    "<S> the spectra also show numerous absorption lines of , , and two- to five - times ionized transitions of c , n , o , p , s and si . there are no emission features in the spectra , with the possible exception of a weak feature on the red wing of the doublet . </S>",
    "<S> the absorption lines are narrow ( fwhm @xmath1 500  km  s@xmath2 ) , too narrow to arise from the disk photosphere , and at low velocities ( @xmath3700  km  s@xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the and doublets are optically thick . the absorption lines in the plateau spectra show orbital variability : in spectra obtained at orbital phases @xmath4 , low - ionization absorption lines appear and the central depths of the pre - existing lines increase . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in line absorption occurs at the same orbital phases as previously observed euv and x - ray light curve dips . </S>",
    "<S> if the absorbing material is in ( near- ) keplerian rotation around the disk , it must be located at large disk radii . </S>",
    "<S> the final observation occurred when u  gem was about two magnitudes from optical quiescence . </S>",

    "<S> the inferred radius of the wd is , close to that observed in quiescence . </S>",
    "<S> allowing for a hot heated region on the surface of the wd improves the fit to the spectrum at short ( @xmath6960   ) wavelengths . </S>"
