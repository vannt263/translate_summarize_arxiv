    "light scalar mesons constitute a remarkable exception of the quark model systematization of mesons and their nature still need to be unambiguously established @xcite .",
    "particularly , the nature @xmath2 meson is under debate . according to the naive @xmath3 picture and strong coupling with kaons",
    ", @xmath2 can be interpreted as a pure @xmath4 state @xcite@xcite . however",
    ", this interpretation does not explain mass degeneracy between @xmath2 and isovector @xmath5 , which is interpreted as a ( @xmath6 state .",
    "it is also interpreted as a four quark @xmath7 @xcite bound state of hadrons @xcite@xcite and as a result of a process known as hadronic dressing @xcite .    for understanding the content of the @xmath8 meson several alternatives",
    "have been suggested : for example , analysis of @xmath9 decay @xcite@xcite and investigation of the ratio @xmath10 @xcite are believed to be the most promising ones for this purpose .",
    "the @xmath9 decay is a very efficient tool for this purpose , since the branching ratio is essentially dependent on the content of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is a pure @xmath4 state , the branching ratio is @xmath11 , while if @xmath8 is composed of four quarks then the branching ratio is expected to be @xmath12 .",
    "the strong coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 are among the important hadronic parameters entering to the analysis involving @xmath15 and @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , the kaon loop diagrams contributing @xmath9 are expected to be in terms of @xmath14 , as well as @xmath13 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath14 is studied in light cone qcd sum rules @xcite ( more about light cone qcd sum rules and and its applications can be found in @xcite ) .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the strong coupling constant @xmath13 in light cone qcd sum rules method . it should be noted that this constant can be obtained from experimental data on @xmath15 meson decays .",
    "the goal in the present work is twofold : firstly , can we get new information about the quark content of @xmath15 meson comparing experimental data with theoretical results ?",
    "secondly , how does light cone qcd work for the asymmetric case , i.e. , with different borel mass parameters corresponding to different mass channels ?",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we derive sum rules for the @xmath13 coupling constant . in section 3",
    ", we present our numerical results and conclusion .",
    "in this section we calculate the strong coupling constant @xmath13 in light cone qcd sum rules .",
    "this coupling constant is defined by the following matrix element : [ e5601 ] k^-(q ) ^0(p , ) k^+(p+q )  , where the momentum assignment is specified in brackets and @xmath16 is the polarization vector of the @xmath15 meson . in order to calculate the strong coupling constant @xmath13 we consider the following correlator function [ e5602 ] _",

    "|j_^k ( 0 ) } 0  , where the quark current @xmath17 is the axial vector current and @xmath18 is the interpolating current for the @xmath15 meson .",
    "the correlator function , in general , can be written in terms of the following five independent invariant functions [ e5603 ] _",
    "( p , q ) = _ 1 g _",
    "+ _ 2 p_p_+ _ 3 p_q_+ _ 4 q_p_+ _ 5 q_q _  . therefore",
    ", our first problem is to choose the kinematical structure . for this aim , we consider the phenomenological part of the correlator function .",

    "it follows from this expression that the only the structures @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 give contribution to the correlator function .",
    "in further analysis , we will choose the structure @xmath19 from which the corresponding invariant structure [ e5607 ] =  , follows .",
    "our next task is the calculation of the correlator function from qcd side .",
    "this calculation can be carried out by using light cone operator product expansion method , in which we work with large momenta , i.e. , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are both large . the correlator function , then , can be calculated as an expansion near to the light cone @xmath25 .",
    "the expansion involves matrix elements of the nonlocal operators between vacuum and the kaon states , i.e. , in terms of kaon wave functions with increasing twist .",

    "let us discuss sources of the uncertainties .",
    "@xmath61 breaking effects in kaon distribution amplitudes which we neglected , can play essential role , since we can explore wide range of @xmath62 and hence smoothing the effects of the shape of wave function .",
    "additional uncertainty arises from the value of @xmath63 .",
    "all these factors can cause an uncertainty about 510% .",
    "moreover , the errors coming from the variations in the continuum threshold and borel masses , change the result about 10% . if all these uncertainties are taken into account ,",
    "the resulting error is about 20% , which is quoted in eq .",
    "( [ e5622 ] ) .",
    "finally , we would comment that , existing experimental results on @xmath64 decay predicts @xmath65 .",
    "so , obviously , we see that our result is quite close to the experimental value .",
