    "during the total solar eclipse of may 29 , 1919 , a group led by eddington @xcite confirmed the effect of general relativity in bending light rays around the sun .",
    "the experiment predicted the effect to be measurable for small stars of surface gravity 275 m / sec@xmath11 . later in 1965 ,",
    "a second test for general relativity conducted by pound and rebka @xcite predicted that general relativistic effects ( particularly , gravitational blue or red shift ) are even recordable in the small gravitational field of the earth .",
    "these experiments clearly suggest that the effects of general relativity would be much more noticeable in the case of dense stars .",
    "it is therefore important to know what correction would follow due to einstein s general theory of relativity if it were applied to dense stars like white dwarfs . as compared to newtonian stars , the equation determining the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star changes drastically when the general theory of relativity is taken into account . in this paper",
    "we have studied how this change would modify the stellar structure of a few typical white dwarf stars .",
    "it appears that these effects may become important for large values of central density .",
    "however we find , in the case of a few white dwarfs , that the effect is small and it modifies the chandrasekhar s limiting mass by a small amount .",
    "white dwarfs are small faint stars having reached the end of their stellar evolution .",
    "the simplest of them are composed mainly of helium at high temperature ( @xmath12 k ) and pressure .",
    "the thermal energy provided by the temperature is sufficiently large to ionize the helium atoms completely .",
    "the fermi temperature ( @xmath13 k ) calculated from the electron density suggests that matter inside the star is highly degenerate @xcite . the outward pressure created by the degenerate electron gas keeps the star from gravitational collapse .",
    "after dirac @xcite formulated his fermi - dirac distribution in 1926 , fowler @xcite treated the electron gas in sirius - b as almost completely degenerate .",
    "he treated the electron gas as non - relativistic and found no limiting mass for the star .",
    "however , anderson @xcite and stoner @xcite considered the electron gas as relativistic and found the existence of a limiting density , although the treatments were heuristic .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite obtained the limiting mass as @xmath14 by treating the degenerate electron gas as relativistic . in 1934 , chandrasekhar @xcite succeeded in formulating the theory of white dwarfs to full generality .",
    "he employed newtonian gravity and an equation of state valid for the entire range of electron velocities , including relativistic velocities , of the degenerate fermi gas to obtain the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "he thus obtained the equations in the form of lane - emden equation with index @xmath15 and solved the differential equations numerically to obtain the limiting mass of @xmath16 ( the chandrasekar limit ) . in 1964",
    ", chandrasekar @xcite also consider the problem in the general relativistic framework and obtained the limiting mass as @xmath17 . in 1965 ,",
    "anand @xcite studied the effect of rotation on a white dwarf star .",
    "he showed that the effect of rotation modifies the value of limiting mass to @xmath18 implying an increase of 2.5% in chandrasekhar s limiting mass .",
    "qualitative arguments given by landau and lifshitz @xcite suggests that the inter - particle coulomb interaction is negligible in a white dwarf star . later , using the method of bohm and pines @xcite , singh showed that the correction to the electron density due to electron - electron interaction is small and can be treated as negligible @xcite .    in deriving the general relativistic equation of equilibrium for compact stars ,",
    "tolman @xcite and oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite showed how the newtonian equation of hydrostatic equilibrium is modified into what is known as tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation .",
    "they considered the energy - momentum tensor for a perfect fluid in einstein s field equation and solved for the metric for the interior of the star .",
    "it turned out to be a set of three differential equations in four unknown functions , which is incomplete unless provided with additional information , namely , the equation of state .",
    "while tolman obtained the interior solution for a few different analytically tractable cases , oppenheimer and volkoff numerically solved those equations for massive neutron cores by taking the full equation of state treating it as a non - interacting fermi gas .    in this paper",
    "we consider the hyrostatic equilibrium of white dwarf stars and obtain the mass - radius relationship by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "it is found , for large values of central density , that the chandrasekhar s limit ( in the newtonian case ) is slightly modified as a result of general relativity .",
    "our calculation indicate that chandrasekhar s limiting mass of @xmath0 @xcite is modified to @xmath1 for @xmath2he ( and @xmath3c ) white dwarf stars . the critical mass for @xmath4fe white dwarf stars is also calculated using general relativity , which is found to be @xmath5 .",
    "we have also obtained the critical densities for gravitational instability directly from the solution of tov equations without any approximation and comparethem with the neutronization thresholds .",
    "we find that @xmath2he and @xmath3c white dwarf stars are stable aganist neutronization with the critical value of @xmath1 whereas the critical masses for stability are smaller due to neutronization for @xmath6o , @xmath7ne , @xmath8 mg , @xmath9si , @xmath10s and @xmath4fe white dwarf stars .",
    "we have also obtained the maximum stable masses due to neutronization for these stars by solving the tov equation corresponding to the central densities for neutronization thresholds .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we outline the derivation of tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation for a perfect fluid in equilibrium in general relativity .",
    "the problem of white dwarfs is taken up by considering the equation of state of cold degenerate electron gas in tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation .",
    "the non - linear coupled differential equations so obtained are solved numerically in section 3 , where the equation following from newtonian gravity are also solved for the sake of comparison .",
    "the mass - radius relationships obatined in the two cases are also compared . in section 4 ,",
    "the instabilities due to gravitation and inverse beta decay are considered .",
    "the limiting masses at neutronization threshold are computed for a few relevant stars by solving the tov equation .",
    "the numerical results are presented with a few relevant plots .",
    "the metric that describes the interior of a spherical symmetric star is given by @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of @xmath22 for the static case .",
    "the matter inside the star is considered to be a perfect fluid with energy - momentum tensor @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the macroscopic mass - energy density and pressure respectively . for the line element given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : one ] ) , the non - zero components of the energy - momentum tensor are given by @xmath26 einstein s field equations corresponding to the above line element and the energy - momentum tensor are given by @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where primes denote differentiation with respect to @xmath22 .",
    "these three equations together with the equation of state of matter @xmath30 determine the hydrostatic equilibrium for an isotropic general relativistic static fluid sphere .    from the above one can obtain the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation , namely @xmath31 \\left[1+\\frac{4\\pi p(r ) r^3}{m(r ) c^2}\\right]\\left[1-\\frac{2gm(r)}{c^2 r } \\right]^{-1 } \\label{eq : five}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and the mass - energy density @xmath24 has the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the mass density and internal energy density respectively .",
    "( [ eq : five ] ) and ( [ eq : six ] ) together with the equation of state @xmath30 determine the equilibrium configuration .",
    "in a white dwarf star , the matter consists of electrons of rest mass @xmath36 as a degenerate fermi gas .",
    "the equation of state is given by the parametric forms @xmath37    @xmath38    where @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the number of electrons per nucleon , @xmath43 is proton mass , @xmath44 the planck s constant , @xmath45 the fermi momentum and @xmath46 the speed of light . the above equations are valid for all values of electron velocities , including the extreme relativistic region .    substituting eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eight ] ) and ( [ eq : nine ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : five ] ) and ( [ eq : six ] ) , the following differential equations are obtained .",

    "eqs .  ( [ eq : ten ] ) and ( [ eq : eleven ] ) can be made dimensionless by introducing dimensionless variables @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( which are referred to as dimensionless radius and mass , respectively ) .",

    "we have employed fourth order runge - kutta method to integrate them .",
    "the solutions of these equations are computed for several initial values of @xmath57 at the centre of the star .",
    "integration is carried out from the value @xmath58 , @xmath59 at @xmath60 ( centre ) to @xmath61 ( surface ) where @xmath62 ( which makes @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 .",
    "some of the results of the numerical intergration are given in table  1 for @xmath65 .",
    "in the limit @xmath66 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : twelve ] ) and ( [ eq : thirteen ] ) reduce to the simple forms @xmath67    0.5 cm    .mass , radius and central density for various @xmath57 for helium white dwarf stars . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for white dwarfs whose neutronization density is smaller than the onset density of gravitational instability we expect an unstable phase before reaching the critical mass obtained from general relativity .",
    "inverse beta - decay that sets in before the gravitational instability reduces the electron density which in turn reduces the degeneracy pressure so that we expect a smaller value for critical mass than that obtained by general relativity .",
    "table  2 compares the critical central density and inverse beta - decay threshold density for white dwarfs of different compositions .",
    "critical central density given in the second colunm is obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq : twelve ] ) and ( [ eq : thirteen ] ) for @xmath68 ( for @xmath2he , @xmath3c , @xmath6o , @xmath7ne , @xmath8 mg , @xmath9si , and @xmath10s ) and @xmath69 ( for @xmath4fe ) .",
    "these values are expected to be better than the values given in the third column [ obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : twentytwo ] ) ] as they are based on the solution of the full tov equation .    comparing the critical densities given in the second and fourth columns of table  2 , we see , for @xmath2he and @xmath3c white dwarf stars , that gravitational instability sets in before neutronization instability can set in .",
    "this implies that the critical mass for helium and carbon white dwarf stars is @xmath1 .",
    "for all the rest of the stars , threshold density for neutronization starts before the critical density for gravitational instability is reached .",
    "this implies the critical masses of @xmath6o , @xmath7ne , @xmath8 mg , @xmath9si , and @xmath10s white dwarf stars must be lower than @xmath1 and the critical mass of @xmath4fe white dwarf stars must be lower than @xmath5 .",
    "we compute the corresponding masses numerically from the tov equations and identify them as the critical masses for stability aganist neutronization , which are shown in the last column of table  2 .",
    "from our above investigation it has been seen that the general relativistic effects have lowered the limiting mass of a white dwarf star .",
    "the new value ( @xmath1 ) that is obtained by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation is not too far from chandrasekhar s limit ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus it is clear that the general relativistic effects are small in the case of a white dwarf star that lowers the chandrasekhar s limit by approximately 4% .",
    "the equation of state we assumed is valid for all electron velocities , both non - relativistic and ultra relativistic , connecting the two regimes smoothly .",
    "however , the equation of state does not incorporate the inter - particle interaction .",
    "the neglect of inter - particle interaction is however justified in the limit of high density @xcite .",
    "in fact it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the electrostatic correction to the equation of state can be treated as negligible . the maxima of the mass - radius curve ( in fig .",
    "4 ) marks the onset of gravitational collapse and the region towards the left of the maxima corresponds to an unstable region .",
    "it is expected that the growth in density makes the electrons more relativistic so that the condition favoring inverse beta decay is approached .",
    "we took account of the neutronization by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : twentythree ] ) obtained on the basis of salpeter s arguments and calculated the onset density for inverse beta - decay for different compositions of the star ( shown in column  4 of table  2 ) .",
    "we found that stars composed of lighter elements ( @xmath2he and @xmath3c ) are more stable than those composed of heavier elements ( @xmath6o , @xmath7ne , @xmath8 mg , @xmath9si , @xmath10s and @xmath4fe ) .",
    "the onset for inverse beta decay is found to start before reaching the onset of gravitaional instability in the heavier elements .",
    "the maximum stable mass we obtained by solving tov equations for these stars ( @xmath1 for @xmath6o , @xmath7ne , @xmath8 mg , @xmath9si , @xmath10s and @xmath5 for @xmath4fe ) no longer can be indentified as the limiting masses . in the last column of table  2",
    ", we list the maximum stable mass by solving the tov equations corresponding to the central densities for neutronization thresholds .",
    "mass distribution of a large number of white dwarf stars with a wide range of masses , including low and massive stars , were ploted by various researchers @xcite .",
    "the most massive non - magnetic white dwarf observed was lhs4033 @xcite which was predicted to have an oxygen - neon core with a mass in the range of @xmath70@xmath71 .",
