    "since the existence of dirac quasiparticles has been proved for graphene , one of the most intriguing issues of its physics is the possibility of their localization by whichever imperfection that can appear in the honeycomb lattice.@xcite moreover , it should not be overlooked that the effect of disorder on the transport of quasiparticles is sensitive to the nature of inhomogeneity , be it caused by short - range or long - range defects , neutral or charged impurities , adsorbed or interstitial atoms or molecules , vacancies , spatial distortions or structural irregularities , including ripples on the graphene sheet and other long - wave random modulations .",
    "all these different types of imperfections necessitate corresponding dedicated studies , which can not be accomplished by resorting to a single impurity model .",
    "since these imperfections are rather dissimilar both in their character and action on basic properties of graphene , respective theoretical models should be diverse as well .",
    "early experiments on graphene - based devices , which were engineered like a commonplace field effect transistors , revealed that the sample conductivity never drops below a certain _ minimal _",
    "value.@xcite this fact , indeed , considerably reduced audacious expectations that corresponding devices are capable to serve as next - generation electronic switches .",
    "nevertheless ( or , maybe , exactly because of this ) , the minimal conductivity existence has produced quite a stir , and its origin has been relentlessly debated .",
    "distinctive features of charge carriers , which were shown to obey the linear dispersion , constituted the core of this discussion .",
    "uniqueness of the electron subsystem in graphene were pushed to its limits so much that former physics of semiconductors were sometimes categorically declared being utterly unsuitable for this uncommon material .",
    "it has been speculated that massless , according to their dirac dispersion , charge carriers can not be localized by any degree of disorder caused by lattice imperfections or impurity centers . the presumed impossibility to localize dirac excitations",
    "were directly linked to the minimal conductivity phenomenon by a simple reasoning .",
    "since the product of the wave vector modulus and the mean free path is confined from below for propagating states according to the ioffe - regel criterion , the conventional drude expression immediately yields the minimum value of @xmath0 for each conducting channel .",
    "this argument , along with available experimental results , has led to an opinion that the minimum conductivity value has a _ universal _ character for graphene , and is expressed only through fundamental constants .    in the mean time , there appeared occasional theoretical studies , which did not deny a possibility to localize charge carriers in graphene , and argued for the mobility edge appearance under certain circumstances , either for a disorder of a general type,@xcite or for a specific impurity model , in particular , for substitutional defects,@xcite and for the anderson model of disorder.@xcite later , it has become apparent that the minimal conductivity in graphene does depend on the sample quality and noticeably varies with the impurity concentration.@xcite furthermore , not so long ago , a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in graphene dosed with atomic , which is essential , hydrogen has been convincingly observed .",
    "the mit has been manifested by an increase of the room temperature resistance in about four orders of magnitude.@xcite the transition has been reported for the grown on sic surface graphene with a low hydrogen coverage , namely , around @xmath1 .",
    "the presence of the mobility gap has been also reported for the fluorinated and ion bombarded graphene.@xcite    as well , corresponding data of arpes measurements indicated the disappearance of quasiparticle excitations in the system .",
    "the mit of the anderson type comes about when the fermi level finds itself inside a domain of _ localized _ states . since the graphene in the actual experiment was pristine before the hydrogen deposition and possessed sounding metallic properties with conventional fermi - liquid behavior , it is tempting to anticipate that some amount of deposited hydrogen is sufficient to open up a reasonably wide region filled with localized states , or a _ quasigap _ , in the spectrum .",
    "in essence , this draft description of the leading to the mit process corresponds to the well - known phenomenon of _ spectrum rearrangement_,@xcite which deals with decisive modifications in the elementary excitation spectrum upon increasing the impurity concentration in the system .",
    "when the quasigap is located in the vicinity of the fermi level position , the mit can take place in spite of the rather low hydrogen concentration .",
    "below we are going to link together the predicted spectrum rearrangement in graphene with point defects and the observed mit under the hydrogen dosing.@xcite the spectrum rearrangement takes place when a single impurity induces a local or a resonance level in the spectrum .",
    "it has been demonstrated recently that graphene almost inevitably contains traces of impurity centers , which are capable in producing resonance states.@xcite",
    "let us discuss some general spectral properties of impure systems and assume for this purpose that inside an isolated host band in a hypothetical @xmath2-dimensional system a single impurity center accounts for a resonance state with the energy @xmath3 , which is measured against the band edge and has been made dimensionless by the corresponding bandwidth .",
    "the dispersion relation for this host band is supposed to be of the form @xmath4 . then , the spatial behavior of the host green s function at a given energy inside the band , apart from any other details , should be governed by oscillations with the characteristic radius @xmath5 , which is expressed in units of the appropriate lattice constant . at the energy @xmath6",
    ", these oscillations determine the effective radius @xmath7 of the impurity state . through a closeness of the resonance energy to the band edge",
    ", the effective radius of the impurity state may far exceed the lattice period .",
    "as the impurity concentration is increased , the individual impurity states are becoming more tightly packed .",
    "it can be anticipated that a significant spatial overlap between these states is capable in provoking qualitative changes in the spectrum .",
    "the average distance between impurities @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the ( relative ) impurity concentration , is gradually shrinking with increasing @xmath9 , and at some stage of the process becomes of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "this general condition defines the critical concentration @xmath11 of the spectrum rearrangement in the corresponding impure system .",
    "it seems justifiable to reiterate here that the value of @xmath12 can be fairly low due to the smallness of the energy @xmath13 .",
    "graphene is , evidently , a two - dimensional system , so that @xmath14 , and features the linear dispersion of charge carriers , which implies that @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , the critical concentration of spectrum rearrangement in the impure graphene is expected to be @xmath16 , where energy is counted from the dirac point , at which the valence band and the conduction band coincide . in a case of the conventional dispersion with @xmath17 ,",
    "the identical in appearance relation between @xmath6 and @xmath12 is inherent in four - dimensional systems . in this sense graphene ,",
    "as regards the spectrum rearrangement , can be formally viewed as a conventional system of _ increased _ spatial dimensionality .",
    "this fact further accentuates the uniqueness of graphene , since the spectrum rearrangement has not been studied for such systems .",
    "let us return back to experimental data contained in ref .  .",
    "the comparison of angle - integrated spectrum for clean and hydrogen dosed graphene suggests that the dimensional resonance energy @xmath18 lies somewhere around @xmath19 ev lover than the initial fermi level , while the dirac point position @xmath20 in the undoped crystal is about @xmath21 ev below it .",
    "a bit more careful analysis of the spectrum rearrangement in impure graphene , @xcite which is based on the expansion of the self - energy into a cluster series,@xcite brings about the following expression for @xmath12 , which , for a convenience , is rewritten here in terms of the hydrogen coverage , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the areal density of carbon atoms in graphene , @xmath24 nm  the lattice constant of graphene , @xmath25  the critical coverage of hydrogen atoms , @xmath26 ev  the bandwidth parameter , and the logarithmic correction is omitted because of the relatively large resonance energy .",
    "substitution of the guessed value for the resonance energy results in @xmath25 that is reasonably close to the reported mit critical hydrogen coverage of @xmath27 @xmath28.@xcite as a matter of fact , the critical coverage of the spectrum rearrangement @xmath25 , should not be identical to the experimentally obtained hydrogen coverage required for the mit , which will be discussed later .",
    "it should be also noted that there are two main types of the spectrum rearrangement : the _ cross _ one , which is usually accompanied by a sharp single impurity resonance , and the _ anomalous _ one . the first type of the spectrum rearrangement results in a quasiparticle dispersion that looks like a familiar hybridization between the host branch and a dispersionless branch at the impurity resonance energy . in this case ,",
    "two new branches are separated by a gap , which widens with an increase in the impurity concentration .",
    "consequently , two different wave vectors correspond to the same energy in this split spectrum .",
    "however , this feature has not been detected in the arpes measurements on the hydrogenated graphene .",
    "the second type of the spectrum rearrangement , which is usually encountered in low - dimensional systems , is of a more diffused nature and frequently corresponds to a considerably smeared single impurity resonance .",
    "this anomalous spectrum rearrangement is characterized by the opening of the quasigap , which is filled with localized states and separates two non - overlapping branches of extended states exhibiting a renormalized dispersion .",
    "the anomalous type of the spectrum rearrangement has been shown to unfold in graphene for impurities described by the lifshitz model.@xcite within this model , identical impurity centers are supposed to be randomly distributed on sites of the host lattice .",
    "each impurity is only allowed to change the on - site energy at its location in the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "it is well - known that the electron subsystem in graphene encompasses practically free @xmath29-electrons , which number is equal to the number of lattice sites .",
    "as soon as an additional hydrogen atom lands on graphene , its uncoupled s - electron immediately enters a chemical bond with one of the @xmath29-electrons .",
    "that should make the latter one localized almost completely at the impurity site . in the first approximation",
    ", one can assume that the resulting perturbation comes only from the appearance of strong attracting potential on the occupied carbon atom .",
    "thus , the disordered system is described by following operators , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the host hamiltonian , in which summation is restricted to nearest neighbors , @xmath32 runs over lattice cells , indices @xmath33 and @xmath34 enumerate sublattices , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the creation and annihilation operators at the corresponding lattice site , @xmath37 ev  is the tight - binding transfer integral for the @xmath29 bands in graphene , the variable @xmath38 takes the value of @xmath39 with the probability @xmath40 or the value of @xmath41 with the probability @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the hydrogen coverage , and @xmath44 is the difference in the on - site potential at the defect position .    within this model ,",
    "the local density of states ( ldos ) at the lattice site occupied by a hydrogen reads , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the diagonal element of the host green s function @xmath47 in the vicinity of the dirac point in the spectrum , namely , within the window stretching up to around @xmath48 ev to each side of it , this diagonal element can be easily approximated , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the same bandwidth parameter as in ( [ critcov ] ) .",

    "[ f1 ] for @xmath53 ev . as follows from the figure , the resonance energy @xmath18 is located approximately @xmath54 ev above the dirac point and thus corresponds to the experimentally observed peak . while the required change in the on - site potential is quite substantial ,",
    "the large perturbation magnitude should be considered , first of all , as a result of the chosen simplified impurity model .",
    "unless another is explicitly specified , the perturbation value of @xmath55 ev will be used below for all subsequent estimations .",
    "ev.,scaledwidth=96.0% ]    when a certain amount of deposited hydrogen atoms is taken into account , the negative potentials induced by them on the occupied lattice sites impede the electron movement . for the lifshitz impurity model , which has been described above ,",
    "the course of the spectrum rearrangement has been studied both analytically and numerically.@xcite the analysis has shown that states are subject to localization near the resonance energy , where the impurity scattering is the strongest . at some coverage ,",
    "a quasigap occupied by localized states opens around the energy @xmath18 . with increasing impurity concentration",
    ", the quasigap gradually broadens and the degree of localization inside it rises .",
    "this quasigap expansion and the localization enhancement are not symmetric about the energy @xmath18 and are more expressed above the resonance ( for an attractive potential ) .",
    "finally , the quasigap consumes all the space between @xmath18 and @xmath20 in the spectrum , which corresponds to the onset of the spectrum rearrangement by the definition . in other words ,",
    "the spectrum rearrangement does follow the anomalous scenario .    in the experiment discussed",
    ", dosed hydrogen atoms act not only as scattering centers , but also as acceptors .",
    "thus , their presence inevitably lowers the fermi level of the system .",
    "therefore , while the hydrogen coverage is increasing , the fermi level and the upper boundary of the quasigap , where the localization of states is most pronounced , are moving toward each other . sooner or later , the fermi level should appear inside the quasigap , which will cause the mit of the anderson type . since the energy @xmath18 is positioned somewhere in - between @xmath20 and the bare fermi level @xmath56 , the critical coverage of the spectrum rearrangement should be close but not identical to the critical coverage of the mit .",
    "the acceptor effect of the deposited hydrogen atoms is also implicitly contained in the lifshitz model .",
    "strong attracting potential @xmath44 produces a deep local level below the conduction band .",
    "because of its remoteness from the continuous spectrum , the corresponding narrow impurity band should hold almost @xmath57 energy levels , where @xmath58 is the total amount of carbon atoms in the system .",
    "thus , taking into account the spin degeneracy , this impurity band consumes nearly one electron per deposited hydrogen atom .",
    "however , apart from these qualitative considerations , the adopted impurity model allows to address the question on the fermi level position more precisely .",
    "consider the ( normalized ) total number of states with energies that are less than a specified one , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the density of states . in a disordered system",
    "this quantity can be expanded in powers of the impurity concentration,@xcite @xmath61 where the presence of two sublattices in graphene and the lifshitz impurity model are taken into account , and @xmath62 is the total number of states in the host system . keeping in mind that the deep impurity band is modeling the acceptor effect of impurities , it is natural to demand the conservation of the number of occupied states in the system with varying the amount of dosed hydrogen .",
    "this yields a kind of a balance condition , @xmath63 where the constant term is dropped from the both sides of the equation , and eq .  ( [ apr ] ) is used to obtain @xmath62 for the clean graphene . from here and on this condition",
    "will be employed to determine the fermi level position at a given dosing level .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dirac point position ( which should not be confused with its value for the unperturbed system @xmath20 ) is gradually shifted with increasing the impurity concentration by approximately @xmath64 . since the dirac point and the fermi level",
    "are both moving in one direction , namely to lower energies , the distance between them does not shorten remarkably .",
    "for @xmath65 , the presence of attracting impurities does not distort significantly the quasiparticle dispersion in the valence band .",
    "in contrast , impurities noticeably affect the conduction band .",
    "the self - energy @xmath66 , which enters the dyson equation @xmath67 for the averaged over impurity distributions green s function of the disordered system @xmath68 can not be attributed only to the impurity scattering in the actual experiment of ref .  , because the linewidth of the arpes data is not negligible even at the absence of impurities . to deal with this issue",
    ", we assume that all other sources of its broadening , except the controlled amount of hydrogen atoms , can be roughly described by a constant dumping term , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is those part of the self - energy , which results from the impurity scattering , and @xmath71 is the identity matrix .",
    "a comparison of the density of states obtained by the numerical simulation with the one resulted from the standard average t - matrix method showed that at @xmath65 this approximation works rather well in the vicinity of the impurity resonance.@xcite within this single - site approximation , the impurity - induced part of the self - energy is diagonal in lattice sites and sublattices for point defects , @xmath72 thus , taking into account both assumptions , the total self - energy is also diagonal , @xmath73 according to the conventional expression for the spectral function , @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the fermi velocity , the wave vector @xmath76 is counted from the corresponding dirac point , and only one branch , which is manifested in the actual experiment , is retained , it is straightforward to put down corresponding expressions for the inverse width of the momentum distribution curve at its half - height , @xmath77 and for the inverse of its median @xmath78 both this quantities are taken at the fermi level , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and depicted in fig .",

    "@xmath87 @xmath28 .",

    "the reduction is evident in comparison with the dispersion in the valence band , or with the idealized graphene ( [ ham0 ] ) .",
    "the experimentally obtained quasiparticle dispersion looks already distinctly distorted before any hydrogen deposition .",
    "the distortion can be attributed to the possible presence of unidentified impurities in the system.@xcite to a certain extent , this issue can be crudely addressed by a corresponding adjustment of the hopping integral @xmath88 in the hamiltonian .",

    "anyhow , the resulting adjustment of the zero coverage fermi wave vector moves the entire curve for the inverse fermi vector upwards and , thus , diminish the impurity concentration , at which the ioffe - regel criterion ceases to hold .",
