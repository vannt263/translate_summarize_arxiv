    "we have generalized the dynamical real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) calculations for the kinetic ising model  @xcite to dilute lattices with arbitrary number of nearest neighbors , motivated by an interest in the relaxation behaviour on networks  @xcite with scale free and exponential degree distributions .",
    "we first computed the dynamical critical exponent @xmath2 , in the migdal - kadanoff bond moving scheme  @xcite on networks with arbitrarily high , but uniform , connectivity and found as have others  @xcite , that @xmath2 gradually converges to unity , as the spatial dimension of the system becomes very large ( for @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) , and the correlation length exponent converges to @xmath5 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ dynexpmk ] and [ correxpmk ] ) this is in contrast to the expected mean field values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 above the upper critical dimension .",
    "the dynamic real - space renormalization group calculation thus yields neither a sharp crossover above the upper critical dimension , @xmath8=4 , nor the correct mean field behaviour in the high dimension limit .",
    "we have observed that a static rsrg calculation with migdal - kadanoff bond moving scheme ( mk ) also converges to the same limits , but it does so from above , whereas the dynamical rsrg calculation does so from below .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ correxpmk ] )    the reason why the mk approach fails to provide a reasonable approximation to the critical behaviour of @xmath9 dimensional hypercubic lattices in large @xmath9 , is twofold .",
    "the first is because it underestimates the contribution from the loops in the @xmath9-dimensional euclidean lattice and this effect leads to more and more inaccurate results for large dimensions .",
    "we have found a way to improve the performance of the rs approach in relation to @xmath9-dimensional hypercubic lattices , by defining a new type of rsrg cluster , which retains the inter - connectivity of the moved spins , and were able to obtain a convergence to @xmath10 ( better than 1 but still larger than 0.5 ) in the limit of large dimensionality ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ correxp ] ) likewise , the dynamical critical exponent in this scheme converges to the value 1.6 for dimensions @xmath12 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ dynexp ] ) the new clustering scheme for the rsrg also performs very well in low dimensions .",
    "the dynamical exponent calculated within our scheme for @xmath13 is @xmath0 and for @xmath14 is @xmath1 , to be compared with the best simulation results  @xcite , which give values between 2.11 and 2.24 for @xmath13 and between 2.01 and 2.11 for @xmath14 .",
    "the second reason for the divergence of mk results from those on euclidean hypercubic lattices , is the nonuniform topology of the underlying hierarchical lattice , on which the mk scheme for rsrg is realised as an exact transformation .",
    "@xcite we turn this feature to an advantage in investigating the dynamical behaviour of the ising model on networks with power - law degree distributions .",
    "going over to the dynamical critical behaviour for bond diluted lattices , we first applied the dynamic rsrg technique to the bond diluted kinetic ising system in two and three dimensions .",
    "the approximation we used to compute the configuration averages is in fact exact for annealed randomness .",
    "the approximate transformations for the dilution parameter @xmath15 and the coupling constant are well behaved as one approaches the separatrix , or critical line , from above , but the approximation breaks down in the ordered phase and for low temperatures in the disordered phase . in both two and three dimensions we were able to compute the rg flows on the disordered side of the separatrix and on the separatrix itself , and thereby determine the phase diagrams . in two dimensions",
    "we find a disorder fixed point , which is unstable , and which we interpret as a tricritical point , since there the second order phase transition line gives way to a first order transition line .",
    "the pure ising fixed point is stable , and determines the exponents along the second order transition line . in three dimensions ,",
    "no disordered critical fixed point is found .",
    "the critical line is depressed to zero temperature at a concentration @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the percolation fixed point .",
    "the flow along the critical line is to the pure ising fixed point at @xmath18 , and thus the critical exponents along the critical line are the same as the pure ising exponents , also in three dimensions .",
    "computing the effective critical exponents along the critical line , we find that @xmath19 varies non - monotonically as a function of @xmath15 , within the intervals @xmath20 $ ] for @xmath13 and @xmath21 $ ] for @xmath14 .",
    "our scheme as well as the conventional equilibrium migdal - kadanoff rsrg ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) fails to predict the crossover to a disorder critical fixed point for @xmath14 , both demonstrated by means of finite size scaling arguments  @xcite applied to large monte carlo simulations  @xcite and expected on the basis of the harris criterion  @xcite .",
    "the value we find for the pure system specific heat exponent @xmath22 via the hyper - scaling realtion @xmath23 in @xmath14 is negative for the static rsrg calculation for @xmath24 , while the dynamic calculation yields a positive @xmath22 .",
    "these results have to be interpreted in the context of the still ongoing debate on the criteria for the stability of the pure - system critical behaviour .",
    "the rather extensive literature on the harris criterion  @xcite has been recently reviewed by janke and weigel  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown by various authors  @xcite that the harris criterion , which equates the crossover exponent for randomness , @xmath25 to the pure system @xmath22 , is simply not applicable on hierarchical lattices , and various alternative criteria , such as the `` wandering exponent ''  @xcite for correlations in the non - periodic variations in the number of bonds incident on lattice points ( the degree of the node ) have been proposed .",
    "the calculation of this exponent for our present rsrg scheme goes beyond the scope of this paper and will be considered in a separate publication .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we setup the dynamical rsrg calculations for bond diluted hypercubic lattices , and introduce a new clustering scheme on which we will implement it .",
    "the last section includes our results and a discussion of the relevance of our results to non - uniform lattices with power law degree distributions .",
    "in order to investigate the effect of the underlying lattice of arbitrarily high degree on dynamical behaviour of an interacting system living on this lattice , we consider an ising model on the nodes of a hypercubic lattice of @xmath9-dimensions , which will be subjected to bond dilution to yield a random network with a poisson degree distribution .",

    ", considering either the static or the dynamic values of the correlation length exponent in table 1 , we find a negative specific heat exponents from the hyper - scaling relation @xmath143 .",
    "this suggests , although not conclusively  @xcite , that on all these lattices , the pure ising fixed point will be attractive within this approach . under dilution , the critical behaviour on the second order phase boundary will be determined by the pure ising fixed point .",
    "in table 1 we also display the dynamical critical exponent @xmath2 at the pure ising fixed point for these values of @xmath9 .",

    "<S> we find the dynamical critical exponents for the kinetic ising model to be @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively at pure ising fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> these values are in very good agreement with recent monte carlo results . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the phase diagram and the critical behaviour for randomly bond diluted lattices in d=2 and 3 , in the light of this new transformation . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide exact correlation exponent and dynamical critical exponent values on hierarchical lattices with power - law degree distributions , both in the pure and random cases .    </S>",
