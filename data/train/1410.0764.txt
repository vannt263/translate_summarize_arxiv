    "they claimed that an enhancement of the field - aligned current occurs at the acceleration region ( nearly equals to the height of @xmath10 peaks ) at substorm onsets , and then it causes the enhancement of flow fields at the magnetic equator .",
    "when the background cavity becomes deep , a nonlinear coupling between the stable and unstable fundamental modes is promoted due to a perpendicular phase shift of @xmath104 and @xmath65 .",
    "the conversion from the initially placed fundamental mode ( cases 13 ) to the iar and har waves ( @xmath167 ) occurs simultaneously .",

    "<S> we performed three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of shear alfv@xmath0n waves in a full field line system with magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling and plasma non - uniformities . </S>",
    "<S> feedback instability of the alfv@xmath0n resonant modes showed various nonlinear features under the field line cavities : i ) a secondary flow shear instability occurs at the magnetic equator , ii ) trapping of the ionospheric alfv@xmath0n resonant modes facilitates deformation of field - aligned current structures , and iii ) hybrid alfv@xmath0n resonant modes grow to cause vortices and magnetic oscillations around the magnetic equator . </S>",
    "<S> essential features in the initial brightening of auroral arc at substorm onsets could be explained by the dynamics of alfv@xmath0n resonant modes , which are the nature of the field line system responding to a background rapid change . </S>"
