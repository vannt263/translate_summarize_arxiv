    "in this paper we study the sine - gordon ( sg ) model at finite densities of the topological charge and small sg interaction constant .",
    "the exactly solvable sine - gordon model has a large number of applications in different subfields of condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics .",
    "the particular case of the sg model of our interest below arose previosly in various studies of the one - dimensional hubbard model close to half - filling , @xcite commensurate - incommensurate transition , @xcite strongly correlated systems in higher dimensions @xcite , collective excitations in a multi - fluxon josephson junction @xcite , superconducting @xcite or quantum hall @xcite double - layer systems in parallel magnetic field and phase excitations in ferroelectric liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "theoretical investigations of the quantum sg model with the finite density of topological excitations ( kinks ) were undertaken by haldane @xcite , caux and tsvelik , @xcite papa and tsvelik .",
    "@xcite these studies , employing the analysis of the bethe anzats equations , established the dispersion of low - lying excitations and the so - called luttinger parameter , defining the asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions .    in the present work",
    ", we use an alternative method to investigate this problem , which was introduced by dashen , hasslacher and neveu , @xcite and is usually called the modified wkb or semiclasscal approach . in this method , one first finds the classical solution to the equation of motion and then analyzes the quantum fluctuations around this solution . @xcite it is known that this method gives excellent agreement with the available exact solutions of several models , and particularly the sg model .    with the use of the modified wkb approach , we find that the spectrum of gaussian fluctuations in our model gives the spectrum coinciding with the one obtained earlier by the bethe anzats method .",
    "@xcite at the same time , applying the standard semiclassical treatment , we encounter strong infra - red divergencies in higher orders of perturbation theory .",
    "the difficulties arise also with the definition of the so - called dual field associated with the charge - raising operator of the theory .",
    "it is known that a troublesome difficulty with the semiclassical approach is the existence of fluctuations bearing zero energy , which corresponds in our case to the translational symmetry of the problem .",
    "the treatment of these `` zero modes '' is best done by the collective coordinate method @xcite , whose straightforward application , though , does not cure our problem .",
    "it is shown below however that it is possible to use a somewhat modified collective coordinate method , to arrive at the action , free from the infra - red divergencies .",
    "technically it is done by allowing the fluctuating field to enter the argument of the classical solution .",
    "the stable infra - red action is achieved at the expense of a more complicated form of the correlations .",
    "proceeding this way , we obtain the leading and subleading asymptotic terms in the density - density correlation functions in agreement with earlier predictions by haldane .",
    "@xcite the definition of the charge - raising operator now becomes free from ambiguities and we can calculate the leading behavior of the superconducting - type correlations . remarkably , the decay of the latter correlations is slow at small densities of kinks , an observation which confirms earlier results .",
    "we demonstrate a non - zero quantum average of the four - fermion umklapp operator in the hubbard model away from half - filling . particularly , it results in the spectral density of the right - moving fermions being distributed over the neighboring @xmath0 harmonics of the density .",

    "this method arises most naturally in path integral formulation of the problem and basically corresponds to the steepest descent method . at a first step ,",
    "one finds the classical configuration of the field , delivering the extremum to the exponentiated action , and then analyzes the spectrum of fluctuations around it .",
    "the general criterion for the applicability of the method is the formally large value of the classical action ; it was shown , however , that the quasiclassics gives exact results for a particular case of sine - gordon model with a zero density of the topological charge .",

    "the basic property of the charge raising operator @xmath262 in the path integral representation is that the contour of integration ( `` dirac string '' ) in the definition of @xmath177 introduces a discontinuity in the field @xmath6 , so that the values of the field @xmath263 differ by @xmath264 across this contour .",
    "@xcite in view of the above property , @xmath265 as @xmath266 , we see that it suffices to require the charge - raising property for the field @xmath210 .",

    "the charge - raising operator , @xmath273 , is now uniquely defined , independent of the contour of integration .",

    "this property allows one to define the fermion operator , see below",
    ".    a counterpart @xmath277 of @xmath278 can not be obtained from ( [ newdual ] ) , which shows again a particular role of the zero mode .",
    "one of the possible ways to introduce the quantized quantity @xmath277 , relevant to our discussion in appendix , is found in @xcite .",
    "one can write these zero - energy components as follows  : @xmath279 with @xmath280 the persistent current attaining integer values , the functions @xmath281 and @xmath282 are expressed through the elliptic functions @xmath283 and @xmath284 , respectively .",
    "a canonical conjugate to @xmath285 is @xmath286 , so the last term in ( [ zeroduala ] ) is simply the previous shift in the initial kink position .",

    "the value of the constant @xmath300 is elucidated from the following sequence of equalities @xmath301 hence @xmath302 one can show , that the sign here is plus for @xmath303 and @xmath304 and minus for @xmath305 and @xmath306 .",

    "we now discuss the hubbard model and regard @xmath315 as four - fermion umklapp term . in this case ,",
    "in addition to the `` charge '' field @xmath6 discussed insofar , one also considers the spin degree of freedom described by the field @xmath316 and its dual one @xmath317 .",
    "we write the right and left fields as the linear combinations    @xmath318    with the spin projection @xmath319 .",
    "the operators @xmath320 may be identified with the right and left fermion , respectively .",

    "the anticommutation of these operators with different projection of spin is ensured by the majorana fermionic variables @xmath324 .",
    "@xcite these variables obey @xmath325 , while @xmath326 .    a subtler question concerns the relation of the construction ( [ fermion ] ) to the initial fermionic variables in the hubbard model . in the bosonization procedure ,",
    "the initial fermions were written similarly to ( [ fermion ] ) , with the dual field @xmath177 in ( [ rmover ] ) instead of our @xmath293 .",
    "the oscillator representation ( [ qfield ] ) for the initial right(left ) bosons had simple form , which is achieved within our formalism for @xmath327 at @xmath328 .",
    "it is not at once clear that the complicated expressions ( [ newdefphi ] ) , ( [ newdual ] ) , ( [ eta1 ] ) in the presence of umklapp term , @xmath329 are related to right and left moving particles .",
    "we state here that the label `` right '' of the boson field @xmath330 simply indicates the species of fermion , which is constructed this way .",
    "as we will see shortly , umklapp interaction produces a partial redistribution of the fermionic spectral weight over the @xmath0-components of the density , hence initially right - moving particle has now left - going components .    in short ,",
    "our fermions ( [ fermion ] ) anticommute , have the same initial field @xmath6 , and explicitly acquire the conventional form at @xmath328 .",
    "therefore they are the fermions , which one starts with during the bosonization of the hubbard model .",
    "the spin fields of the fermions are factorized , and for the charge part we have @xmath331 cf .",
    "( [ eiam - series ] ) , ( [ defcoefc ] ) .",
    "the fermionic correlations are found in the form @xmath332 in the case of free fermions ( @xmath328 , @xmath333 ) one has @xmath334 , and the anomalous dimension of the fermion vanishes , @xmath335 .",
    "we observe that at special values of the luttinger parameter , @xmath336 , certain @xmath337 vanishes as well , and the fermionic correlations reveal purely chiral ( subleading ) component . for @xmath338",

    "we have obtained the critical exponents for the correlation functions which depend on the luttinger parameter @xmath136 .",
    "some inspection of the formula ( [ luttparam ] ) reveals that at small densities the fermi velocity is exponentially small , @xmath341 , and the parameter @xmath342 eventually becomes large .",
    "haldane s analyzis of the bethe - ansatz equations has shown the crossover region at @xmath343 and the saturation of @xmath344 at smaller densities .",
    "this statement , albeit reasonable , is hard to check in our formalism .",
    "the saturation of @xmath136 can be a result of the intervention of some class of diagrams , increasingly important at small densities .",
    "as we have shown , the full lagrangian ( [ lagr - best ] ) is free from infra - red divergencies . on the other hand",
    ", it requires the essential ultra - violet regularization .",
    "the situation is reversed when one works with the initial field variables ( [ l - expa ] ) .",
    "hence the question of saturation of @xmath136 remains open within our formalism .",
    "we have studied the sine - gordon model in the presence of a finite density of kinks .",
    "this quantum problem is related to the strongly interacting electronic system in one spatial dimension close to commensurability , where the metal - insulator transition occurs .",
    "the model was investigated previously by the bethe ansatz method , which gave a form of the spectrum and the luttinger parameter , defining the decay of correlations functions at large distances .    in dealing with complicated problems , it is always worth to have alternative methods at hand , suitable for cross - checking with existing results and capable for further theoretical predictions . in this paper",
    "we used the semiclassical approach and demonstrated that the spectrum and the luttinger parameter correctly reproduced the results of the bethe ansatz studies . among the new features , available due to the quasiclassics , are the explicit form of various correlation functions and the unambigous construction of the charge - raising operator in the theory .",
    "discussing the correlation functions , we determined their leading and subleading asymptotes , whose amplitudes and critical exponents strongly depend on the kink density . addressing a more technical issue of the charge - raising operator , or the dual field in the theory , we showed the way it is constructed through the modified collective coordinate method .",
    "this allowed us to re - establish the link with the fermionic counterpart of our bosonic problem and to calculate , in the leading order , the behavior of the superconducting - type correlations .",
    "one the consequences of our approach is the non - zero value of the quantum average , associated with the four - fermion umklapp operator in the hubbard model away from half - filling . as a result",
