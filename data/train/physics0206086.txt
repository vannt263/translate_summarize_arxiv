    "the most commonly studied source of damping in oscillating systems is a resistive force @xmath5 proportional to velocity , such as due to fluid drag at very low relative speed , when the reynolds number @xmath6 is of the order 1 or less .",
    "the equation of motion involves a _ linear _ differential equation of the type @xmath7 which yields an exponential decay @xmath8 for the normalized amplitude of oscillations .",
    "the decay is independent of the initial amplitude , a characteristic of the linear nature of the system . here",
    "@xmath9 refers to the instantaneous displacement of a block in a spring - mass oscillator or the angular displacement of a physical pendulum .    for weakly damped oscillations ,",
    "it is convenient to consider the oscillator energy @xmath3 averaged over one cycle , during which period the amplitude @xmath10 is nearly constant . with @xmath11",
    ", we have @xmath12 , and the change in the oscillator energy over one cycle is @xmath13 .",
    "this yields the linear energy loss equation @xmath14 over long time scales compared to the oscillation time period .",
    "the normalized energy @xmath15 also decays exponentially , independently of the initial energy .",
    "in most laboratory oscillators , however , non - linear terms actually dominate in the energy loss equation . a @xmath2 term results from the nearly velocity - independent dry friction , for instance at the pivot of a physical pendulum or due to a brake pad ,",
    "whereas air resistance leads to a @xmath16 term as the reynolds number is typically of the order of 1000 , in which regime the air resistance is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "another potential contribution to the energy loss equation arises from a centripetal correction to the normal reaction at the pivot , and therefore to the friction . as the average centripetal force @xmath17 , this leads to a @xmath16 correction to the contact friction contribution in the energy loss equation .    in certain situations ,",
    "even electromagnetic damping in an oscillating system leads to a @xmath2 damping term , as recently reported for a simple experimental setup involving a magnet oscillating through a coil.@xcite similar damping behavior is expected in an oscillating pendulum consisting of a copper or aluminum disk , periodically passing between the pole pieces of two strong magnets placed near the mean position , provided the conducting disk passes through the magnetic field in a very short time compared to the oscillation time period . on the other hand , a continuously acting electromagnetic damping force , as on a conducting spinning wheel placed between two strong magnets , leads to a @xmath3 damping term .    in practice ,",
    "the oscillator energy loss is therefore typically described by the following non - linear equation @xmath18 in this article we describe a quantitative study of the expected initial - condition dependence of the amplitude decay due to the non - linear damping , and discuss a practical application of this initial - condition dependence . even though the different damping terms have characteristic decay signatures",
    " a linear decay of amplitude with time for @xmath2 damping , an exponential decay for @xmath3 damping , and an inverse power decay for @xmath4 damping  a practical difficulty often encountered is how to distinguish between several weak damping terms present simultaneously . towards this end , we suggest a sensitive experimental procedure for quantitatively identifying the separate damping contributions in eq . ( 3 ) .",
    "furthermore , as this procedure requires only the _ initial _ amplitude decay and not the full decay over long time , it is especially useful in situations where very small oscillation amplitudes can not be reliably obtained .    either separately , or in combination , the different damping terms have been considered in several earlier studies .",
    "these include a harmonic oscillator with sliding friction@xcite and viscous force,@xcite an oscillating sphere with fluid drag,@xcite and a physical pendulum with air resistance,@xcite dry friction,@xcite and electromagnetic damping.@xcite",
    "we have used a common laboratory setup for studying electromagnetic induction to monitor the oscillation amplitude .",
    "an oscillating magnet passes through a coil periodically , generating a series of electromotive force ( emf ) pulses . in a practical realization of this concept , a rigid semi - circular frame of aluminum , pivoted at the center ( o ) of the circle ( see fig .",
    "1 ) and free to oscillate in its own plane about a horizontal axis through o , has a rectangular bar magnet mounted at the center of the arc passing through a coil c of suitable area of cross section . a convenient way of monitoring the induced emf pulses , and therefore the oscillation amplitude , is through a pc interface , which can be readily realized by low - cost , convenient data - acquisition modules available in the market .",
    "the amplitude can also be directly monitored by connecting the oscillator shaft to a precision potentiometer , and recording the instantaneous voltages through a pc interface.@xcite    the underlying electromagnetic induction phenomenon in this oscillating system has been discussed earlier.@xcite the induced emf is significant only in a very narrow angular range about the mean position , and if the angular amplitude is not too small ( @xmath19 ) , the angular velocity of the bar magnet is very nearly constant in this narrow angular range .",
    "the peak emf @xmath20 is then approximately given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the time period of ( small ) oscillations , and the maximum angular velocity @xmath23 , if @xmath24 ( in radians ) is small compared to 1 .",
    "thus , the peak emf @xmath20 provides a measure of the angular amplitude @xmath25 , and the oscillator energy @xmath26 is directly proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "while a solution of eq .",
    "( 3 ) is easily obtained , it is more instructive to proceed in steps , and we consider three separate cases .      when only a @xmath2 damping term is present , as due to contact friction and intermittent electromagnetic damping , the solution of eq .",
    "( 3 ) yields a linear decay of the normalized oscillator amplitude with time @xmath29 where the decay slope @xmath30 is inversely proportional to the initial amplitude .",
    "a phase - space plot between the normalized angular momentum @xmath31 and angular displacement @xmath32 is a linear spiral , and the number of cycles executed before the oscillations come to a stop is proportional to the initial amplitude .      when a resistive force proportional to velocity is included , which would be appropriate for low relative velocities when the reynolds number @xmath34 , the solution is modified to @xmath35 which leads to an exponential decay @xmath36 in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "it is instructive to consider the @xmath38 limit .",
    "expanding the exponential term , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath3 damping term contributes to the deviation from linearity , and as @xmath38 , all second- and higher - order terms vanish , leaving only the linear term , as in eq .",
    "( 5 ) .",
    "we again consider the small - time behaviour of the oscillator energy @xmath42 or amplitude @xmath43 given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) , and substituting in eq . ( 3 ) we obtain    @xmath44    as expected , the initial energy @xmath45 appears with both the non - linear terms @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and hence both @xmath48 and @xmath49 depend on the initial amplitude .",
    "more importantly , the decay slope @xmath48 depends on the damping constants @xmath46 , @xmath50 , and @xmath47 , which implies that the linear part of the amplitude decay itself contains information about all the damping terms .    a typical amplitude decay with time is shown in fig . 2 for both the open- and short - circuit configurations",
    "a dominantly linear decay is seen in both cases , with a deviation from linearity becoming pronounced at large times . in the open - circuit configuration ,",
    "the damping is due to friction and air resistance .",
    "when the coil is short - circuited ( through a low resistance ( @xmath51 ) so that the emf pulses can be monitored by tapping the voltage across the resistor ) , intermittent electromagnetic damping is activated due to the induced eddy current when the magnet passes through the coil .",
    "least - square fits with the quadratic form given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) yield @xmath52 sec@xmath53 and @xmath54 sec@xmath55 for the open - circuit case , whereas for the short - circuit case @xmath56 sec@xmath53 and @xmath57 sec@xmath55 .",
    "the linear decay rate @xmath48 is significantly larger in the short - circuit case due to the additional contribution to @xmath46 from electromagnetic damping . from eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we note that the ratio @xmath58 depends only on the air - resistance damping coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath47 .",
    "if the electromagnetic damping only modifies the @xmath46 term,@xcite then this ratio should be indentical for both cases , provided the initial amplitude is identical .",
    "the near doubling of this ratio in the short - circuit case is therefore a clear indication that electromagnetic damping also introduces small @xmath3 and @xmath4 damping terms which modify the quadratic coefficient @xmath49 .",
    "equation ( 9 ) shows that both @xmath50 and @xmath47 contribute to the coefficient @xmath49 of the quadratic term in eq .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to distinguish between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 damping terms from the initial amplitude decay , unless the dependence on the initial energy ( amplitude ) is taken into account .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( 8) suggests a pedagogically instructive experimental procedure for identifying the signature of the weak damping terms @xmath46 , @xmath50 , and @xmath47 by studying the initial amplitude dependence .    if the amplitude decay is written as @xmath59 , and the peak emf @xmath60 as @xmath61 then from eqs .",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) , the slope @xmath62 of the linear part of the decay can be written as @xmath63 \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath64 defines the constant @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , a constant , linear , and quadratic dependence of the slope @xmath66 on the initial amplitude @xmath67 will be signatures of the weak damping terms @xmath46 , @xmath50 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "figure 3 shows the amplitude decay for different initial amplitudes @xmath67 in the open - circuit configuration .",
    "there is no noticeable change in the slope , as confirmed from the plot of the decay slope @xmath66 vs. @xmath67 shown in fig .",
    "4 . the slope remains constant at @xmath68 v / sec , and this rules out both the damping terms @xmath50 and @xmath47 .",
    "it thus appears that air resistance and centripetal correction to friction do not have any observable contribution to the amplitude decay , and the friction contribution is given by @xmath69 v / sec .",
    "when a @xmath70 cardboard sheet was attached to the oscillator frame to provide air resistance , the amplitude decay showed a clear dependence on the initial amplitude @xmath67 , as seen in fig .",
    "least - square fit of the peak - emf decay with the quadratic form of eq .",
    "( 10 ) yields the decay slope @xmath66 , which shows a significant increase with @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "least - square fit of the decay slope @xmath66 with the quadratic form of eq .",
    "( 11 ) yields @xmath71 v / sec / deg and @xmath72 v / sec / deg@xmath73 for the linear and quadratic coefficients , respectively .",
    "it is instructive to note that the air resistance contribution to the decay slope @xmath66 due to the cardboard sheet is comparable in magnitude to that due to friction at the pivot .",
    "the presence of a small @xmath50 term , although ideally this term should vanish if the air resistance were purely proportional to @xmath1 , has also been noted earlier.@xcite",
    "qualitatively different damping terms can be distinguished from each other by studying the variation of the amplitude decay slope with the initial amplitude .",
    "a constant , linear , and quadratic dependence of the decay slope on the initial amplitude are signatures of the @xmath74 , @xmath3 , and @xmath75 damping terms , respectively .",
    "a quantitative determination of the contributions of contact friction and air resistance due to an attached vane is demonstrated ."
