    "one of the long - standing issues in solar physics is the problem of the origin and even the very existence of a high degree of linear polarization of some chromospheric spectral lines observed in solar flares . over the last few decades ,",
    "several authors have reported the detection of linear polarization signals in solar flares , with fractional polarization amplitudes at the level of several percent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed spectral lines include caiik , nad@xmath0 , and the hydrogen lines h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 .",
    "this polarization is typically not observed in the center of the flare ribbons but rather at their boundaries with the surrounding chromosphere and it is often found to be perpendicular ( i.e. , radial ) or parallel ( i.e. , tangential ) to the nearest solar limb .",
    "the standard interpretation of this polarization is in the terms of impact polarization of the atomic levels due to non - thermal particle beams and/or the neutralizing return currents @xcite , even though polarization can also be observed during the gradual phase of a flare ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , other authors have reported no observable linear polarization above the 0.1% level @xcite .",
    "up to now , most of the interpretations of the observed polarization have been done either in the so - called last scattering approximation ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) or using one - dimensional ( 1d ) models taking into account the effects of radiation transfer @xcite .",
    "a specific version of impact polarization due to evaporative upflows has been proposed by @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a different perspective on the interpretation of such observations .",
    "the chromospheric lines of interest are formed under non - lte conditions and they are susceptible to resonant scattering polarization ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the 1d plane - parallel approximation of the flare ribbons must fail at the ribbon edges where the strong horizontal gradients of the physical conditions are found . from the point of view of the radiative transfer theory ,",
    "the ribbons are a remarkable example of a multi - dimensional medium where the anisotropy and symmetry breaking of the radiation field may be very significant .",
    "this can result in enhanced emission of linearly polarized radiation in spectral lines due to resonance scattering . for a basic investigation of resonance line polarization and the hanle effect in horizontally inhomogeneous stellar atmospheres see @xcite .",
    "one of the most familiar manifestations of scattering polarization in the sun is the so - called second solar spectrum @xcite . in the vicinity of a solar flare ,",
    "the cylindrical symmetry of the atmosphere is broken and multi - dimensional calculations are necessary . in this letter , we do nt consider the possible role of impact polarization and we solve a two dimensional ( 2d ) radiative transfer problem using a simple model of a flaring atmosphere to study the role of scattering polarization and the hanle effect on the emergent spectral line polarization .",
    "we describe the polarization state of radiation by means of the vector of stokes parameters @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the specific intensity , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 quantify the linear polarization . in our calculation",
    ", we do not consider the circular polarization due to the zeeman effect .",
    "following the usual convention , we define the positive @xmath5 direction to be parallel to the nearest solar limb . in this work",
    ", we apply the theory of spectral line polarization described in @xcite .",
    "the description of the mean intensity , anisotropy , and symmetry properties of the radiation field at a given point of the atmosphere can be done using the irreducible representation of the radiation field tensors , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "the physical meaning of the individual @xmath7 components becomes apparent from their definition ( see sect.5.11 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath10 corresponds to the familiar mean intensity of the radiation and it is the only non - zero radiation tensor if the field is isotropic .    in order to find the atomic excitation state at every point within the model atmosphere , the @xmath7 tensors need to be calculated at every such point by solving the radiative transfer equation for the stokes parameters .",
    "the radiation field tensors enter the equations of statistical equilibrium whose solution provides the density matrix of the atomic levels , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath9 for the level with the total angular momentum @xmath13 . in this representation , @xmath14 is proportional to the population of the level and @xmath15 components contain information on the polarization state of the level . in our model , only the @xmath16 components ( alignment ) need to be accounted for , while the @xmath17 components ( orientation ) are identically zero .",
    "it follows that levels with angular momentum @xmath18 can only hold population but not the atomic polarization . after a self - consistent solution of the non - lte problem",
    ", one can synthesize the emergent polarized spectra @xcite .",
    "in the case of a cylindrically symmetric plane - parallel atmosphere , all the coherence components @xmath19 are identically equal to zero and only the @xmath20 components remain .",
    "such a description is adequate in the case of 1d unmagnetized models of the solar atmosphere in which the emergent polarization is either radial or tangential with respect to the nearest limb .",
    "if the cylindrical symmetry is broken due to the presence of an inclined magnetic field and/or due to horizontal inhomogeneities of the thermal structure of the plasma , a general description taking into account all the @xmath11 elements is necessary ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if magnetic field is present in the atmosphere , scattering line polarization can be modified via the hanle effect ( see sect.5.7 of * ? ? ?",
    "the hanle effect typically leads to rotation of the polarization direction and to decrease of the polarization degree of the emergent radiation .",
    "the order of magnitude of the magnetic field strength at which the hanle effect becomes significant for a particular spectral line can be quantified by the so - called critical hanle field , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the lifetime of an involved atomic level and @xmath23 is the land factor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for chromospheric lines ,",
    "@xmath24 is usually in the interval from milligauss to few deca - gauss .",
    "if the field is significantly stronger than @xmath24 ( the so - called hanle effect saturation regime ) , the quantum coherence in the reference frame in which the magnetic field is parallel to the quantization axis , is destroyed and the polarization direction of the emitted radiation is either parallel or perpendicular to the plane defined by the magnetic field vector and the photon propagation direction .      given that the goal of this letter is to point out the general mechanism of a possible creation of the linear polarization in solar flares , we do not particularize the model atom to any specific chemical species . instead , we choose a generic two - level model atom with a resonant transition at @xmath25 , the einstein coefficient of the spontaneous emission of @xmath26 , and the atomic weight of hydrogen .",
    "the angular momenta of the lower and upper levels are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the line absorption profile is a voigt profile with a damping parameter @xmath29 , constant throughout the atmosphere .",
    "we neglect the effect of stimulated emission .",
    "we assume the approximation of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) .    according to sect .",
    "[ ssec : polar ] , the lower atomic level with zero angular momentum can only hold population but it can not be polarized .",
    "the only polarizable level is thus the upper level whose non - zero density matrix elements are the population @xmath14 and the five complex components @xmath30 of the alignment . the land factor of the upper level is @xmath31 and the critical hanle field of our line is @xmath32 g .",
    "we consider a simple isothermal 2d model atmosphere with the kinetic temperature @xmath33k representing the solar chromosphere .",
    "it corresponds to a vertical slice perpendicular to the flare ribbon with @xmath34 being the vertical and @xmath35 being the horizontal axis ( see below ) .",
    "the atmosphere is exponentially stratified with the number density of atoms given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 km .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath35-direction .",
    "the computational domain extends horizontally from @xmath39 mm to @xmath40 mm . at these boundaries ,",
    "the solution is virtually identical to the corresponding 1d solution for a given vertical column of the isothermal atmosphere .",
    "this justifies the use of periodic boundary conditions . along the @xmath34 axis",
    ", the model extends from @xmath41 mm , which corresponds to the photospheric level where the line is thermalized , to @xmath42 mm , which corresponds to the optically thin upper chromosphere .",
    "the thermal collisions are characterized by the collisional destruction probability @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the collisional de - excitation rate due to the thermal collisions .",
    "we do not consider any collisional depolarization in this work .",
    "we model a single flare ribbon by adding the non - thermal collisional excitation rate in the central part of the model atmosphere . according to the theory of non - thermal beam propagation ( e.g. ,",
    "* ) , particle beams deposit part of their energy via non - thermal excitation of the atoms .",
    "this process is most efficient in the middle and upper chromosphere . in our model , the region of enhanced non - thermal excitation",
    "is restricted in both @xmath34 and @xmath35 directions in order to mimic the presence of a spatially localized ribbon .",
    "using the sigmoid function @xmath45^{-1}$ ] , we consider the total collisional excitation rate ( i.e. , thermal plus non - thermal ) , to be given by an ad hoc expression @xmath46\\ , , \\label{eq : clu}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 mm is a @xmath34-coordinate of the maximum of collisional rates , @xmath48 mm controls the vertical extension of the region of enhanced non - thermal collisions , @xmath49 mm is the half - width of the ribbon in the horizontal direction , and @xmath50 mm determines the horizontal gradient of collisional rates at the ribbon edges .",
    "the spatial distribution of collisional excitation rates is plotted in fig[fig : colls ] .",
    "the above increase of collisional rates is chosen by analogy with more realistic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that our choice is rather conservative since the non - thermal collisional rates can exceed the thermal ones by much more than the factor of ten considered here in eq.([eq : clu ] ) .",
    "only the collisional de - excitation due to the thermal electrons must be considered while the de - excitation by the high - energy non - thermal collisions can be neglected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is therefore constant in the model atmosphere and the only spatially dependent rate is @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath52 is the population transfer rate and that we do not consider impact polarization in our model .    magnetic field at the flare - loop footpoints",
    "can be assumed to be roughly vertical with a strength of a few hundred gauss .",
    "that is well above the hanle effect saturation of most of the spectral lines of interest and also above the saturation of our generic line . in the following section",
    ", we study both non - magnetized and magnetized solutions of the radiative transfer problem .",
    "we have solved the non - lte problem described in the previous section using the radiative transfer code porta @xcite applied to a 2d grid with @xmath53 grid points . in fig.[fig : int ] , we compare the line intensity profile of the ` quiet ' region of the atmosphere with the profile obtained at the center of the ribbon .",
    "the later resembles the characteristic emission line profiles in solar flares @xcite .      in fig.[fig :",
    "jkq ] , we show the self - consistent values of the @xmath7 tensors within the model atmosphere . the anisotropy of the line radiation vanishes everywhere below @xmath54 mm , where the optical thickness of the line becomes significantly larger than unity . far away from the ribbon , at @xmath55 mm",
    ", the atmosphere can be accurately modelled using the plane - parallel approximation .",
    "there we can find the height variation of @xmath56 anisotropy which is typical in the isothermal atmospheres ( see fig.1 of * ? ? ? * ) .    in accordance with our expectations",
    ", we have found that the anisotropy of the radiation is highest at the edges of the ribbon with @xmath57 mm and @xmath58 mm ( see fig.[fig : jkq ] ) , i.e. , mainly in the regions of the atmosphere which are not directly affected by the beam itself .",
    "all the @xmath59 tensorial components at the height of formation of the line center , i.e. , above @xmath60 mm , are affected by the strong anisotropic emission of the ribbon .",
    "it is in these boundary regions where the @xmath61 and @xmath62 components , which are due to the breaking of the plane - parallel approximation , are nonzero .",
    "anisotropy in the center of the ribbon is relatively small .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the center of the ribbon , the horizontal gradients of physical quantities are smaller than at the ribbon edges .",
    "however , in case of a narrow ribbon , one can expect a polarization even in the ribbon center due to different radiation intensities along and perpendicularly to the ribbon orientation .    in fig.[fig",
    ": stokes ] , we show the emergent stokes profiles of the line for an inclined line of sight ( los )",
    ". the maximum fractional polarization is found at the ribbon edges and the total degree of linear polarization reaches @xmath63% .",
    "the degree and orientation of polarization depends on both inclination and azimuth of the los , i.e. , on the position and orientation of the ribbon on the solar disk .",
    "polarization degree in the central part of the ribbon is significantly reduced with respect to the edges due to the lower radiation field anisotropy in the ribbon center and due to the increased role of the collisional excitation .",
    "interestingly enough , in many spectropolarimetric observations , the orientation of polarization vector is either perpendicular or parallel to the nearest solar limb regardless of the ribbon orientation at the solar surface @xcite .",
    "this fact is usually used for advocating the role of impact polarization due to the particle beams of various energies propagating along the vertical magnetic field lines .",
    "however , the magnetic field itself can directly affect the line polarization via the hanle effect .",
    "we include this mechanism in the calculations presented in this section .",
    "we have kept the model atmosphere and the model atom as in sect.[ssec : nonmag ] but we have included a uniform vertical magnetic field of strength @xmath64 g , i.e. , well above the hanle - effect saturation of our line .",
    "given the fact that the radiation field is not cylindrically symmetric at the ribbon edges , the hanle effect of the vertical field modifies the atomic polarization ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the atomic coherences @xmath65 are practically removed by the action of the vertical magnetic field in the saturation regime and only the population @xmath14 and alignment @xmath66 of the upper atomic level remain . with @xmath67",
    "are significantly affected by the presence of magnetic field . ]    similarly to the case of a cylindrically symmetric plane - parallel atmosphere , in which only the @xmath14 and @xmath66 components remain , polarization of the emitted photons is either radial or tangential .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig.[fig : stokesb ] which has been calculated for the same los as fig.[fig : stokes ] but taking into account the action of the magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath68 signal , which quantifies a deviation of the polarization vector from the radial and tangential directions , is negligible with respect to @xmath69 in the regions of interest . in case of the los considered in our example ,",
    "the orientation of the polarization is radial .",
    "we have demonstrated that the horizontal inhomogeneities of the atmosphere may lead to the creation of significant scattering polarization signatures in spectral lines which are consistent with some of the most common observational findings .      1 .",
    "the scattering polarization is largest at the ribbon edges due to scattering of the anisotropic ribbon emission .",
    "the degree of such polarization can be of the order of several percent .",
    "sufficient spatial resolution of the observations is necessary for detection of this polarization because the region of enhanced polarization is small .",
    "the non - detection of @xcite may be due to the low spatial resolution of the observations which was @xmath70 ( for quantitative discussion see appendix  a of * ? ? ?",
    "2 .   polarization in the center of the ribbon is smaller than polarization at the edges due to the lower anisotropy of radiation and due to stronger inelastic collisions .",
    "the role of collisional depolarization in the ribbon center due to collisions with thermal electrons and protons may also play a role in the case of the hydrogen balmer lines @xcite but it is questionable for the lines of other species ( nad@xmath0 , caiik ) which are mainly depolarized by collisions with neutral hydrogen whose density actually decreases in the ribbons .",
    "3 .   in the presence of a strong vertical magnetic field ,",
    "the relaxation of atomic coherences due to the hanle effect causes emission of predominantly radial or tangential spectral line polarization , depending the particular spectral line , on the los , and on the anisotropy of the radiation field .",
    "polarization can be expected during both the impulsive and gradual phases of a flare .",
    "the condition for creation of the polarization is a presence of a localized flare ribbon breaking the plane - parallel symmetry of the atmosphere .",
    "our model is simple and we have neglected several important facts : we have assumed that the ribbon can be approximated by a 2d structure ; we have neglected a possible influence from a different nearby ribbon ; we have assumed that the ribbon is symmetric with respect to the @xmath71 plane .",
    "the last of these approximations is probably most severe because it ignores the different physical conditions in the inner ribbon edges that are affected by the presence of the post - flare loops .",
    "we have chosen the non - thermal collisional rates so that the resulting emission line intensity profile resembles those of @xcite .",
    "reduction of the non - thermal collisional rates or reduction of their horizontal gradient leads to decrease of the radiation anisotropy and , consequently , to reduction of the emergent fractional polarization .",
    "the scattering polarization signals are further altered by number of physical quantities such as the horizontal gradients of the temperature of the plasmas , the magnetic field direction , collisional depolarizing rates , and the particular spectral line under consideration .",
    "different combinations of these parameters may lead to a large variety of the observed polarization signals .",
    "exploration of such parameter space should be a subject of future detailed investigations .",
    "we are grateful to javier trujillo bueno ( iac ) and stanislav gunr ( aias ) for their valuable comments to the manuscript",
    ". financial support by the grant agency of the czech republic through grants and , and by the project is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "dashed line : the center of the ribbon ( @xmath71 mm ) .",
