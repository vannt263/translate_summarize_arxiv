    "the collective motion of individuals that exhibit complicated group dynamics is a hallmark of living systems from single - celled bacteria to large mammals .",
    "collective groups can gain advantages including ultra - sensitivity to perturbations , increased temporal response , and increased protection from the environment  @xcite .",
    "it is often considered that individuals follow simple interaction rules that give rise to surprising group phenomena as an emergent property  @xcite . however , in many cases , how a group decides to change its behavior , or alternatively how groups can perform multiple functions , remains unclear  @xcite .",
    "do individuals have to perform increasingly more complicated tasks , or can they merely transition between a preset number of simple interaction rules to modify group behavior  @xcite ?",
    "a striking manifestation of multicellular collective behavior is the formation of dynamic cells groups by the soil - dwelling bacterium _",
    "myxococcus xanthus _ @xcite . in a plentiful environment ,",
    "the coherent motion of cells allows them to hunt prey through the cooperative production of antibiotics and digestive enzymes @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if a swarm can not find sufficient nutrients , its cells begin a complex , multi - step process that leads to the formation of giant aggregates called fruiting bodies within which many of the cells sporulate @xcite .",
    "this process takes several ( @xmath0 12 - 72 ) hours and involves multiple distinct stages of group behavior @xcite .",
    "fruiting body formation is at its heart a process of cell density coarsening and aggregation .",
    "however , unlike many classical aggregation phenomena where a reduction in mobility gives rise to static aggregates as the motion of the individuals becomes essentially frozen , _ m. xanthus _ cells and cell groups remain dynamic throughout the process , often moving over long distances as fruiting bodies are born , grow and coalesce .",
    "these cells are able to amass cell groups that retain both cellular and group mobility even as the density coarsens over time . for this reason",
    ", models that invoke a density - dependent reduction in cell speed fail to capture subtleties of _ m. xanthus _ group dynamics .",
    "for example , sliusarenko et al . observed a reduction in cell speed during the early stage of fruiting body formation when cells approached nucleation regions of high local cell density  @xcite .",
    "these observations supported a model in which cells form aggregates passively due to jamming inside dense cell clusters .",
    "however , this model yields a frustrated aggregate that can not perform the dynamic group motions often seen later in fruiting body development .",
    "a more complicated interaction rule must be at play .",
    "a common feature of biological collective motion across different length scales is its similarity to the flow of fluids . in particular , the orientational",
    "ordering within these collectives is reminiscent of liquid crystalline fluids  @xcite .",
    "active nematic fluids  @xcite , such as a bird flock or a collection of _ m. xanthus _ cells  @xcite , exhibit giant number fluctuations ( gnfs ) in two or more dimensions  @xcite .",
    "these density changes , where the standard deviation of the number of individuals in a group of size @xmath1 grows faster than @xmath2 , promote the disintegration of cell aggregates . while it is clear that fruiting body development must remain active throughout the entire process , dynamic aggregation can be inherently unstable making the formation of localized aggregates difficult ; how _ m. xanthus _ overcomes this issue is unknown .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of _ m. xanthus _ motility is periodic directional reversals that drive unique collective modes such as wave - like dynamic ripples @xcite .",
    "myxo cells , which glide in the direction of their long axis , possess a dynamic cell polarity that routinely switches direction by 180 degrees @xcite .",
    "these reversal events are accompanied by the exchange of a number of polarity and motility proteins between the leading or lagging poles which then switch roles .",
    "reversals are critical for complex group behavior , a link first observed by blackhart @xcite . without a properly functioning reversal mechanism , _ m. xanthus _ cells fail to order themselves within a swarm , and non - reversing cells are unable to produce an expanding swarm @xcite .",
    "a key limitation of previous studies of _ m. xanthus _ collective behavior is that they were based on observing either large cell groups at low optical magnification incapable of resolving single cell behavior , or only a small number of individuals within a large group where cell - cell dynamic interactions could not be studied . in most of these studies ,",
    "only a small number of cells are analyzed , either manually or semi - automatically , due to a lack of robust algorithms for tracking thousands of cells simultaneously .",
    "recent automated approaches have been limited in scaling up to produce dense long term cell tracks  @xcite.the small size of these datasets precludes an in - depth statistical study of group behavior",

    "here we focus on understanding the very initial stages of fruiting body formation , when sporadically distributed cells find each other to form clusters that merge and grow into larger cell groups .",
    "we show that reversal frequency , instead of cell speed , is the key factor that regulates the group behaviors of cells which switch from an initial flock - like searching to static aggregation .",
    "nematic alignment and cellular reversal produce one - dimensional , stream - like aggregates that are not subject to gnfs .",

    ", we used a frze mutant strain which lacks the ability of cells to reverse . in these non - reversing cells , the local density of the cells increases at a similar rate to the wild type cells ( fig .",

    "the streams are largely fixed in space and increase in width over time as more bacteria align and join the stream .",
    "over the course of the experiment , we observed a marked increase in the reversal frequency of the cells whereas the cell speed remained constant during all four hours of observation ( fig .",
    "[ trackingfig]*g * ) . during the first hour after starvation , the reversal frequency of the cells rapidly increased from 3 reversals per hour to 5 reversals per hour ( fig .",
    "[ trackingfig]*g * ) . during this period",
    "however , the speed of the bacteria remains almost constant at @xmath0  1.5  @xmath9 .",

    "[ explorfig]*a * shows the fraction of the total available area that is visited by the bacteria .",
    "while the wild type cells do not explore more than half of the available area , the non - reversing mutants explore nearly the entire field of view .",
    "we can characterize the temporal dynamics of this spatial exploration into two phases : an exploratory phase and a ` streaming phase ' . in the ` exploratory phase ' , exhibited by wild type cells during the first hour after starvation and non - reversing cells throughput the experiment , cells rapidly explore space , allowing them to search for nutrients and to initiate aggregation by finding neighboring bacteria .",
    "an hour after starvation , wild type cells undergo a phase transition from the flocking phase to the streaming phase .",
    "this slows down the exploration of space dramatically as the cells remain localized within the streams .",
    "the non - reversing mutants , however , continue to flock in groups over the entire four - hour experiment .",
    "to quantify how the motion of individual cells was distributed across space , we constructed a surface - visit map for all the bacteria in a field - of - view , i.e. we probed the number of times a location in the field of view had been visited by a bacterium ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "we find that a considerable amount of the space remains unexplored for the wild type bacteria ( fig .",
    "[ explorfig]*b * ) and the highest number of visits are localized to the region in space that eventually forms the stream .",
    "for the non - reversing @xmath5frze mutant cells , however , the visits are distributed more evenly across space ( fig .",
    "[ explorfig]*c * ) . to combine the information from multiple experiments , we calculated the probability distribution , @xmath11 , of the number of pixels with @xmath10 visits from the surface - visit maps ( fig .",
    "[ explorfig]*d * ) . over a range of values of @xmath10 ,",
    "this distribution exhibits a power law decay . while the decay exponent is about @xmath12 for the @xmath5frze mutant",
    ", it is less steep , an exponent of @xmath13 , for the wild type cells .",
    "this power - law decay reveals features of the motility mechanism .",
    "any feature of the system that causes bacteria to have memory of a site they , or another cell , previously visited will result in a bias in the way space is explored when compared to an unbiased random walk .",
    "this bias causes some locations to be more preferable than others and may be a result of the interaction with slime trails deposited on the substrate  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the steeper slope of the decay for @xmath5frze cells indicates that they explore space more uniformly than the wild type as is evident also from the visit map in fig .",
    "[ explorfig]*b*.    strikingly , while @xmath11 decreases monotonically with @xmath10 for the non - reversing bacteria , the distribution for the wild type cells is marked by a peak in the probability at higher values of @xmath10 .",
    "this peak indicates a significant probability that a few sites are preferentially visited many times .",
    "this occurs because of the formation of localized streams in which the reversing bacteria traverse over the same sites over and over .    the distribution @xmath11 changes during the first hour of aggregation , consistent with the occurrence of a phase transition . when calculated using data from the first hour , the power - law exponent is @xmath14 and does not display the peak at large @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the distribution from subsequent times has a slope of @xmath13 and contains a prominent peak at @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ explorfig]*e * ) .",
    "furthermore , the power law exponent of the decay gradually increases over time from the flock - like value to the stream - like value ( fig .",
    "[ explorfig]*f * ) .",
    "as time proceeds , the number of preferred locations for localization of the bacteria increases ( i.e. along the stream ) , each drawing a large number of visits due to the reversal of the cells .     for the bacteria in the stream region during the exploratory and the streaming phases .",
    "data is analysed in the exploratory and streaming phases for bacteria from 5 different streams , each comprising a few hundred bacterial cells .",
    "( * c * ) as the local cell density increases , the cells align along their body axis , leading to an increase in the local nematic order .",
    "the nematic order is an average over 5 streams , each containing a few hundred cells , from 3 different experiments .",
    "( * d * ) number fluctuations for the flocking non - reversing mutants ( red ) and the wild type streams ( blue ) .",
    "number fluctuations are normal for the streams while they are anomalous ( giant ) for the flocks .",
    "( * e * ) the mean squared displacement ( msd ) as shown for the dz2 ( blue ) , which makes a transition from a ballistic motion at the short time scales to an anomalous sub - diffusive behavior at longer times . in contrast , the @xmath5frze mutant ( red ) cells remains superdiffusive throughout .",
    "the msd is an ensemble average of a few hundred cells for each of the cell types .",
    "inset : the mean squared displacement is calculated for every 30 minute time slot from the start of the experiment . ]",
    "bacteria in wild - type streams are ordered much like rod - like molecules in a nematic liquid where the molecules orient themselves in a direction along their long axis . in this ordered state ,",
    "the bacteria maintain liquid - like mobility through active motion and yet remain confined .",
    "this allows them not only to navigate eventually into a fruiting body but also prevents the streams from breaking apart .",
    "[ streamfig]*a * shows the formation of a stream in a region where the bacteria are initially oriented in random directions .",
    "as these bacteria move and collide with one another , the steric interaction during the collision provides a simple physical mechanism to orient them along their body axes such that they lie parallel to each other .",
    "once aligned in a particular direction , the bacteria then move along that direction leading to a new set of collision and realignment events with other bacteria .",
    "the overall effect of such dynamics is the formation of a stream with all the bacteria oriented along the stream axis . during this process",
    ", the bacteria make a phase transition from an isotropic gas - like phase to a nematic liquid like phase in the streams .",
    "this can be seen from the radial distribution function @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ streamfig]*b*. the appearance of distinct peaks in @xmath16 for the streaming phase shows the liquid - like ordering of the bacteria within the stream .",
    "this liquid - like ordering also has an additional orientational ordering of the bacteria due to their elongated shape .",
    "this ordering can be quantified using an order parameter @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the angle between the body axis of the bacteria and a direction of reference oriented along the direction of the stream .",
    "limiting cases correspond to @xmath19 for a perfectly disordered state and @xmath20 when all the bacteria are perfectly aligned with their neighbors .",
    "initially , the random orientation of the bacteria results in a low value of the order parameter @xmath21 and as the stream builds up to reach a steady density , the ordering dynamics progressively orient the bacteria , leading to a nematic state within the stream ( fig .",
    "[ streamfig]*c * ) .",
    "active nematics in two dimensions or more are marked by the presence of giant number fluctuations ( gnfs ) where the standard deviation @xmath22 of a mean number @xmath1 of active apolar particles grows faster than @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "in general , this should lead to disruption of any aggregated groups and would be counter - productive for fruiting - body formation .",
    "these anomalous fluctuations can be compared to more common fluctuations where the standard deviation @xmath22 grows as @xmath2 in accordance with the central limit theorem . in this case",
    ", there are no abnormally large fluctuations in the density of conventional system undergoing common fluctuations whereas density is not a well - defined quantity in an active nematic system .",
    "gnfs , however , are suppressed in one dimension so that @xmath23 .",
    "this is what we observe for bacteria in streams  ( * ? ? ?",
    "[ streamfig]*d * blue ) .",
    "in contrast , the dynamic flocking behavior of the non - reversing cells leads to anomalous giant fluctuations such that @xmath24 as reported previously for bacteria  ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "[ streamfig]*d * red ) . therefore ,",
    "even while the wild type bacteria remain active and motile in the stream , this motility does not lead to large fluctuations in the bacterial density .",
    "this is presumably important for cells to maintain contact with each other and ensure continuity of the aggregates .",
    "motion within a stream is quasi one - dimensional , like cars along a highway .",
    "however , even though the bodies are aligned , their velocities remain uncorrelated due to reversals , i.e. the nematic alignment is apolar without a single direction of motion .",
    "this allows the stream to remain fixed in space while maintaining mobility and avoiding gnfs .",
    "this high level of mobility within the streams is revealed by examining the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) as a function of time for the bacteria ( fig .",
    "[ streamfig]*e * ) . at short times",
    "@xmath25 , the msd increases @xmath26 due to the quasi one - dimensional ballistic motion of the cells .",
    "surprisingly , at longer times , the msd increases @xmath27 indicating a sub - diffusive , constrained motion .",
    "this is due to the confinement of the cell motion in the quasi - one dimensional streams and the periodic reversals of the cell movement direction along the streams leading to head - to - head collision events  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the msd for the non - reversing mutants remains super - diffusive ( i.e. msd @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) for all times .",
    "indeed , this is expected given that these cells form flocks which traverse space in a persistent random walk .",
    "the anomalously slow ( sub - diffusive ) growth of the msd for the wild - type cells indicates a very slow dispersal of the cells at long times which effectively prevents the loss of localization while still keeping the cells motile .",
    "the similarity of the collective motion of _",
    "m. xanthus _ cells to the dynamics of fluids , in particular to liquid crystalline fluids , naturally suggests an underlying self - organization principle .",
    "the various structural aggregates of the _ m. xanthus _ from the isolated cells to the streams and fruiting bodies can be likened to the phase ordering in liquid crystalline fluids , with the switching between the different phases marked by well defined phase transition points .",
    "the key difference between biological systems and everyday fluids is that living matter is active ; the individuals within the group are self - propelled . in statistical mechanics",
    "based theories and simulations , self - propulsion together with simple physical interactions between individuals , such as collisions and steric hindrance , has been shown to lead to collective motion phases and patterns bearing a striking similarity to natural phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the developmental cycle of the _ m xanthus _ can be treated as a collection of various active fluid phase behaviors ( fig .",
    "[ phasediag ] ) embedded in a high dimensional phase space involving both physical and biochemical effects .",
    "our focus in this work is a subset of this phase space involving the changes in local cell density and the reversal frequency of the _ m. xanthus _ cells , in which the randomly organised cells at the very onset of starvation lie close to the lower left corner and can be treated as an isotropic active gas .",
    "the fruiting bodies that result from the aggregation of the bacteria are soft mounds which are a viscoelastic solid - like phase .",
    "the route from the isotropic gas phase to this viscoelastic solid is marked by phases of different levels of ordering and relevant to the developmental cycle of the _ m. xanthus_. as we have shown , the aggregation of the bacteria leads to a nematic liquid which manifests as quasi one - dimensional streams and polar flocks .",
    "some of these active liquid phases and transitions between them have been shown to occur in purely physical systems such as systems of self - propelled rods  @xcite .",
    "however , biological activity , in addition to self - propulsion , involves chemical communication between individuals and further downstream biochemical regulation of motility and interactions between individuals .",
    "the transition between these initial stages of organization of the _ m. xanthus _ is presumably coordinated by the motility of the cells , their physical interactions , as well as biochemical signaling between them  @xcite and internal regulation within individuals .",
    "we have here shown , for example , that the regulation of the reversal frequencies of the cells governs one such transition .",
    "future work defining the phases ( both in 2 and 3 dimensions ) and phase transitions explored by _",
    "m. xanthus _ cells during predation and development , as well as the chemical and biological mechanisms that govern the control of individuals should lead to a much more in - depth understanding of how collective groups can exhibit multiple behaviors .",
    "myxococcus xanthus strains were grown in cye medium ( 1 casitone , 0.5 yeast extract , 10 mm 3-(n - morpholino ) propanesulfonic acid ( mops ) , ph 7.6 , 4 mm mgso4 ) overnight at 32oc to od550  0.6 . for _",

    "the bctracker high - throughput video analysis pipeline involves three major stages .",
    "first , the mosaicking and image enhancement module uses image - to - image registration for mosaic construction combined with several image restoration steps to compensate for illumination variation , increase contrast and filter out noise .",
    "mosaicking is used to construct a larger field - of - view to support the accurate segmentation and tracking of larger bacteria cell groups as they undergo flocking or streaming behaviors where the groups can move between microscope fields , without sacrificing spatial resolution .",
    "image enhancement improves subsequent detection , segmentation and tracking processes . in the second stage ,",
    "the feature extraction and bacteria detection module is used to extract differential geometry and morphological image features tuned for the flexible rod shaped cells .",
    "analysis of the extracted feature vectors results in a multivalued mask that identifies the foreground bacteria , background and halo regions around the cells .",
    "the multivalued mask contains positive and negative contextual regional information and is more versatile than a typical binary cell mask .",
    "an active contour energy function uses this multivalued mask and the fused feature set to evolve the contour adaptively to better locate , refine and segment the deformable thin rod shape of the cells more accurately .",
    "a structural analysis step uses spatiotemporal shape - based constraints like the bacteria skeleton or medial axis , and the neighborhood relationships to model the temporal interactions between spatially adjacent cells .",
    "the results of structural analysis combined with marker propagation in time and multi - frame evidence - based correction is essential for identifying and correctly segmenting touching cells .",
