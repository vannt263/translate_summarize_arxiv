    "the neutron time - of - flight facility n_tof at cern @xcite is devoted mainly to the measurement of neutron induced cross - sections .",
    "neutrons are produced in a lead spallation target and moderated in a borated water - layer surrounding this target .",
    "the protons impinging on the target , provided by the cern proton synchrotron ( ps ) , have a momentum of 20 gev / c and an intensity of 7@xmath310@xmath4 protons / pulse .",
    "this provides a high instantaneous neutron fluence over a wide neutron energy ( e@xmath5 ) range , namely from thermal energies to gev .",
    "+ background photons are produced during spallation ( prompt @xmath6 = @xmath6-flash ) as well as during neutron moderation ( delayed @xmath6 = in - beam @xmath6-background ) and arrive together with the neutron beam at the measuring station . in figure",
    "[ fig : ntof ] the arrival time of photons and neutrons at the measuring station and the corresponding e@xmath5 is shown .",
    "all charged particles produced during the spallation process are removed from the beam via a sweeping magnet in the beam line . +        the measuring station is located 185 m downstream of the target . due to the long flight path",
    ", e@xmath5 can be determined via the time - of - flight technique with a very good energy resolution ( @xmath7e@xmath5/e@xmath5 = 3.2@xmath310@xmath8 for e@xmath5=1 ev ) .",
    "+ during the last 3 years , the experimental program at n_tof has been extended to neutron - induced charged - particle ( n , x ) reaction measurements , with focus on ( n,@xmath0 ) measurements . in this context",
    ", an innovative and very competitive detector has been developed for this purpose .",
    "the experimental challenges for ( n,@xmath0 ) cross - section measurements are the following :    1 .",
    "( n,@xmath0 ) reactions often feature small cross - sections",
    "thin samples are mandatory for low @xmath0-absorption and low @xmath0-energy loss in the sample .",
    "the measurements should be performed under vacuum to minimize the @xmath0-energy loss on the way to the detector .    to maximize the angular coverage and the yield , the detector is to be placed in the neutron beam in close proximity to the sample , see figure [ fig : na ] , and",
    "the size of the detector should be matched to the sample or the neutron beam - size respectively .    )",
    "cross - section measurements .",
    "the neutron beam , together with the in - beam @xmath6-background , impinges on the sample , detector and the surrounding materials . ]    with such an experimental setup the background to be considered is caused by the in - beam @xmath6-background as well as neutron - induced reactions in the detector and structural materials .",
    "this background may become significant and thus needs to be determined carefully during dedicated measurements .",
    "therefore the samples have to be easily exchangeable , which calls for a compact detector - design . +",
    "to obtain optimal background rejection the following is required :    1 .",
    "high resolution @xmath0-spectroscopy , so that different reactions can be identified according to the corresponding q - value .",
    "this can be achieved by using a solid - state detector with low capacitance and a detector material which does not induce noise at room temperature .",
    "low - z material : this ensures a low interaction probability of @xmath6-rays with the detector .",
    "in addition , ( n , x ) reactions in the detector material start at higher e@xmath5 .",
    "minimized material budget : the thickness of the detector has to be adjusted to the range of the @xmath0-particles in the detector",
    ". the backing layer should be as thin as possible .    to ensure these criteria",
    "were fulfilled , single - crystal chemical vapor deposition ( scvd ) diamond ( z = 6 ) was chosen as detector material .",
    "a close - up picture of the diamond mosaic - detector can be seen in figure [ fig : detector ] . for the cross - section measurement , the sample , a thin foil with a deposit of the isotope of interest ,",
    "is positioned via the pin above the mosaic and pressed against the printed circuit board ( pcb ) with metallic clamps . + the mosaic consist of 8 scvd diamond diodes and one diamond - on - iridium ( doi ) diode @xcite , each 150 @xmath9 m in thickness and approximately 4 mm x 4 mm in size .",
    "the thickness of the diodes was chosen for spectroscopic measurements of @xmath0 particles up to 20 mev energy .",
    "+ the diodes are metallized with 200 nm al . on the front side of the diodes ( seen in the picture )",
    "the metallization was left up to the edges of the diodes .",
    "on the reverse side of each diode an electrode of 3.8 mm x 3.8 mm was produced using negative photo - lithography .",
    "+ an additional 500 @xmath9 m thick scvd diamond , metallized with ti - pt - au , and a 100 @xmath9 m thick si diode can be seen in the picture .",
    "these two diodes were used for background measurements , which are not covered in this paper . +",
    "the diodes are glued and wire - bonded on a 0.5 mm gold - plated pcb and interconnected on the grounded front side of the detector . the high voltage ( hv = 1v/@xmath9 m )",
    "is individually applied to each diode from the read - out ( back ) side .",
    "50 @xmath10 mmic connectors terminate the read - out lines .",
    "the capacitance of the mosaic channels is of the order of 10 pf .",
    "however , during measurements under vacuum , the capacitance was of the order of 35 pf , due to 20 cm long sma cables and connectors inside the vacuum chamber .",
    "+ at the rear of the detector - pcb an additional 0.5 mm copper - plated pcb is positioned for shielding purposes . at the front of the detector - pcb , a 1 mm copper - plated pcb with an opening for the diodes",
    "is positioned as a spacer between the sample and the diodes .",
    "the neutron beam at n_tof does not exceed the size of this opening , leaving the diodes and 1 mm of metallized pcb material in the beam .",
    "the thickness and design of the pcb plates were chosen as a reasonable compromise considering a minimum capacitance for each channel , a 50 @xmath10 read - out line and a minimum material budget .",
    "+ the pcb sandwich - structure and the full metallization on the grounded front side of the diodes provides shielding up to 2 ghz rf frequency .",
    "the cividec cx spectroscopic shaping amplifiers @xcite were used for the measurements . the circuit diagram for the measurement",
    "is illustrated in figure [ fig : circuit ] .",
    "the cx amplifiers provide a gaussian pulse shape with 180 ns shaping time and 80 ns rise time .",
    "the gain of the amplifiers was set to 8.2 mv / fc , being optimized for a total energy deposition in diamond of 20 mev .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per mev ( snr / mev ) as a function of the input capacitance of the amplifiers is illustrated in figure [ fig : snr ] . for 35 pf one",
    "finds a snr / mev of 40 ( corresponding to the experimental setup ) .",
    "the energy resolution for the setup is limited to fwhm = 50 kev and the corresponding time resolution is 2 ns / mev , considering the rise time of the amplifiers .",
    "the detector was calibrated with a multiple @xmath0-source ( @xmath11gd , @xmath12pu , @xmath13am , @xmath14 cm ) , placing the uncollimated source at 1 mm distance from the detector in vacuum ( p @xmath15 1@xmath310@xmath8 mbar ) .",
