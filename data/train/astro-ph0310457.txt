    "* ) for the purpose of discovering microlensing events , and , in particular , gradients in the rate of events that should be induced by the high inclination of the m31 disk @xcite , so as to infer the presence of dark compact objects in the m31 halo .",
    "recently , the point - agape collaboration announced the discovery of four high signal - to - noise ratio candidate events in the data taken during 1999 and 2000 seasons ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the mega collaboration has also reported provisional events @xcite .",
    "this paper studies one of the candidate events , pa-99-n2 , which was reported to exhibit an anomaly in its lightcurve . provided that this is not due to any small but systematic photometric error , some physical mechanism behind this behavior must be sought .",
    "this is a productive avenue to explore as it is possible to infer some properties of the lens or source from the deviations from the standard paczyski form . here , we show that the observed deviations are consistent with being due to the close approach to a caustic in a binary lens .",
    "we calculate the parameters of the best fit binary solutions and discuss their implications .",
    "the point - agape collaboration has acquired m31 imaging data for three seasons using the wide field camera on the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope located at la palma , the canary islands , spain .",
    "the full analysis of this data set is in progress .",
    "@xcite reported four microlensing candidate events in the first two seasons of data with full - width half - maximum timescales less than 25 days and with flux variations greater than that of a 21st magnitude star ( in @xmath2 band ) . among them",
    "is pa-99-n2 , which is the second event identified in the northern field with a maximum during the 1999 season .",
    "it is a very bright event ( at maximum ) with high signal - to - noise ratio , lying at 2203  ( @xmath35 kpc in projected distance ) from the center of m31 .",
    "other characteristics are listed in table  1 of @xcite .",
    "the event was observed in three bands , close to the sloan @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters . as are all point - agape observations , the data have been reduced and analyzed using the superpixel method @xcite .",
    "the transformation to ( johnson / cousins ) @xmath7 is derived from the observations of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ lightcurve ] shows the lightcurve of pa-99-n2 resulting from the analysis based on the superpixel method in all three bands for the 1999 season . in figure  [ binresiduals ] , we also present the residuals from the best fit standard paczyski lightcurve ( pl ) .",
    "there are 65 datapoints in @xmath4 , 102 in @xmath5 and 45 in @xmath6 .",
    "the lightcurve is flat during the 2000 and 2001 seasons .",
    "visual inspection of the lightcurve shows that there are systematic deviations around jd@xmath8 65 , which have the same pattern in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands at the same times ( there were no @xmath6 observations made at the time of anomaly ) .",
    "henceforth , jd@xmath8 denotes the julian date minus 2451392.5 . in figure",
    "[ regression ] , we plot the daily averaged @xmath4 datapoints against the daily averaged @xmath5 datapoints whenever those two band observations are available for the same night .",
    "the excellent linear correlation between them confirms the achromaticity of the variable fluxes including the anomalies in the lightcurve .",
    "the standard paczyski fit to daily averaged datapoints gives a @xmath9 per degree of freedom of 3.1 @xcite , which indicates that the deviations are statistically significant .",
    "the photometric recalibration @xcite of the superpixel method may lead to some concern that the deviations are an artifact of the reduction pipeline .",
    "we find a statistical correlation between the seeing and residuals of the superpixel flux with respect to the best fit paczyski curve for the datapoints taken during the deviation ( fig .",
    "[ correlations ] ) .",
    "this raises the concern that the anomaly may be just an artifact due to seeing variations , and that the superpixel method does not make the proper recalibration .",
    "although we emphasize that there exists no such correlation for all other datapoints ( fig .",
    "[ correlations ] ) , it is still worrisome as the superpixel method was not devised for the photometry of bright resolved sources , for which the apparent correlations take place .    to examine the hypothesis that the deviations can be ascribed solely to seeing variations , we model the reported superpixel flux @xmath10 , when the source is resolved , by @xmath11 \\label{eq : seevar}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the true flux ,",
    "@xmath13 is the seeing , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are fit parameters , while @xmath16 ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) for all the other datapoints .",
    "note that this provides a simple way of describing the correlation of flux with seeing found in figure  [ correlations ] .",
    "when we fit for @xmath14 and @xmath15 by requiring the behavior of the true flux to be described by a paczyski curve , this results in significant detections of nonzero @xmath14 s ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) with an overall better fit to the paczski curve , as the @xmath9 decreases from 824.7 ( 700.9 ) to 438.1 ( 321.1 ) . here , the first number is from the data for 1999 - 2000 seasons ( 488 datapoints ) , while the second number is from the 1999 season data only ( 212 datapoints ) .",
    "figure  [ newcurves ] shows the residuals for this fit .",
    "while there is no visible anomaly any more around jd@xmath8 65 , close inspection reveals that the lightcurve is still not entirely consistent with paczyski curve ; the datapoints lie systematically below the rising parts of the model lightcurve ( in particular , @xmath21 ) and the datapoints lie above the model in the falling side wing .. ] in other words , although there is a correlation between flux residuals and seeing , this by itself is not enough to explain the shape of the lightcurve .    one way of testing whether the correlation found in figure  [ correlations ] is purely statistical or betrays a causal relation is to derive a second lightcurve which makes different assumptions as to the effects of seeing variation on the photometry .",
    "we perform fixed - aperture relative photometry of pa-99-n2 on the raw @xmath5 frames with respect to stable stars nearby .",
    "this is possible for 31 frames near the peak of the event . in fixed - aperture photometry",
    ", the same fraction of flux from the source star enters the aperture irrespective of the brightness of the star , for given seeing .",
    "the ratio of flux within the aperture between two stars is therefore the same as the intrinsic ratio , regardless of seeing .",
    "the linear regression shown in figure  [ apversusp ] shows consistency between the superpixel and fixed aperture lightcurves , with no outlier worse than 2@xmath22 .",
    "the residuals versus seeing shown in the inset suggest there is no correlation when seeing is better than 18 although the superpixel flux is lower compared to the fixed aperture photometry when seeing is worse than 18 , which corresponds to the worst outliers at jd@xmath8 63 and jd@xmath8 69 . at outset , we might expect the outliers to have little influence on any fitting result , as the errorbars are large .",
    "this is confirmed by adjusting the datapoints with seeing worse than 18 to correspond to the fixed - aperture photometry and checking that any results do not change qualitatively .",
    "in particular , the measured parameters change by less than the quoted uncertainty .",
    "in figure  [ finallightcurve ] , we present the residuals from a standard paczyski fit of the fixed - aperture lightcurve . again , the discrepancy from the paczyski fit is @xmath310% , which is larger than the formal error .",
    "the mega collaboration @xcite have recently published a lightcurve for the same event , derived from a difference image analysis .",
    "they plot only the daily - averages for epochs of good seeing .",
    "we find that their lightcurve is consistent with the superpixel lightcurve     the seeming consistency of the three methods makes it unlikely that the deviations are caused by the data reduction .",
    "although it is still possible that some unknown systematic problem with the data taking itself could cause such a spurious effect , we have no reason to suspect this at the moment .",
    "there are a number of possible origins for the bump in the lightcurve , including ( i ) intrinsic variability due to either the source star or another neighbouring star , ( ii ) a close approach to a lensing caustic @xcite , or ( iii ) perturbations caused by a binary source ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "parallax effects can also cause perturbations , but the timescale of deviations is typically @xmath23 , much longer than that of the bump in pa-99-n2 .",
    "hence , we discount this possibility .",
    "plots of the rms variation on each pixel of @xmath5 band images taken during 2000 and 2001 seasons show no evidence of any additional variable source within the 7@xmath247 superpixel .",
    "there is also no evidence for any variation in the light centroid during the course of the event , which might be expected if the lightcurve is being polluted by a nearby variable .",
    "this provides good evidence that the bump is not caused by a nearby variable .",
    "it is possible that the source itself is variable , but this is not particularly favored because the deviations are achromatic and because the lightcurve during 2000 and 2001 seasons appears to be flat to good accuracy .",
    "a binary source is somewhat disfavored on the grounds that the perturbations to the lightcurve are usually almost periodic .",
    "however , this possibility can not be definitely ruled out .    in the following , we assume that the deviations are caused by a binary lens .",
    "we find that there are physically reasonable binary lens models that are consistent with the available photometric data of pa-99-n2 to a high statistical significance .",
    "the most straightforward way of generating fold caustics is with binary lenses .",
    "the simplest cases of binary lens lightcurves  a point source in uniform rectilinear motion lensed by a static binary lens  are characterized by six parameters : the ratio of the two masses @xmath25 , the projected separation in terms of the einstein ring radius @xmath26 , the angle at which the source motion crosses the binary axis @xmath27 , the time @xmath28 and the distance @xmath29 of the closest approach to a fixed reference point , or the primary - lens position shifted toward the secondary by the zeroth order correction , @xmath30^{-1}$ ] if @xmath31 . ] and the einstein timescale @xmath32 .",
    "the best fit binary lens lightcurve of pa-99-n2 can be found by searching for the @xmath9 minimum in this six - dimensional parameter space using any standard minimization technique .",
    "note that , while two further parameters for each passband are required to relate the lensing magnifications to the observed fluxes , these parameters enter linearly into the fit , and thus , this part of the problem can be decoupled from the rest of the problem and solved directly by separate matrix inversion .    we have carried out this minimization with the first two seasons of data .",
    "there are 212 datapoints ( 65 in @xmath4 , 102 in @xmath5 and 45 in @xmath6 ) from the 1999 season and 276 datapoints ( 146 in @xmath5 and 130 in @xmath6 ) from the 2000 season .",
    "we have found a number of possible binary lens models , and their parameters are listed in table  [ binarymodel ] . for the formally best fit model ( c1 ) ,",
    "the lightcurve residuals are shown in figure  [ binresidualstwo ] .",
    "we find that there exist several binary lens models that lie at a local @xmath9 minimum for which the @xmath9 difference with respect to the global minimum is quite small .",
    "in particular , the two best fit models , c1 and w1 , are essentially indistinguishable in terms of their values of @xmath9 .",
    "some of these degeneracies would have been broken if the @xmath320-day observation gap between jd@xmath8 72 and jd@xmath8 91 had been regularly covered ( for example , model c2 predicts a cusp grazing near jd@xmath8 74 and model w1@xmath8 shows a second bump around jd@xmath8 77 ) while others are much more difficult to discriminate .    from table  [ binarymodel ] , the timescale of the two best fit binary models are @xmath33 ( c1 ) and @xmath34 ( w1 ) . in either case , the timescale is larger than @xmath392 days reported by @xcite under the assumption of a single point mass lens .",
    "this may be expected from the fact that the binary fit possesses a higher maximum amplification .",
    "examination of images taken well after the event shows no resolved star in the vicinity of pa-99-n2 . on the other hand ,",
    "a barely resolved nearby star at this approximate location in our @xmath5 band image is measured to have a flux of 7 adu s@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "however , the best estimate of the @xmath5 band source flux of pa-99-n2 from the paczyski fit is @xmath36 and thus nominally inconsistent with it being unresolved at baseline at the 2@xmath22 level .",
    "this problem is ameliorated with the binary fit , as the source is predicted to be fainter , namely @xmath37 ( c1 ) or @xmath38 ( w1 ) , well below the detection limit of a resolved star .    using the transformation of @xcite , the baseline source flux",
    "is calculated as @xmath39 , which is the average of the results for the two best fit models .",
    "the source color is determined from the achromaticity of the lightcurve  the slope of the linear regression line in figure  [ regression ] is directly related to the instrumental @xmath40 color , which , in turn , can be translated into @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , the linear regression involving @xmath6 band flux provides the second color @xmath42 .",
    "these colors are roughly consistent with that of an early m giant @xcite with @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite , although secure identification is subject to uncertainties due to unknown reddening , metallicity , and mass of the source . in principle",
    ", one can estimate the reddening from two color measurements , provided that we know the intrinsic relation between the two colors and the proper reddening law . here ,",
    "if we assume that the local m giants sample of @xcite defines an intrinsic @xmath45-@xmath46 relation and that the redding law is described by @xcite with @xmath47 , then we get the extinction , @xmath48 and the dereddened colors of the source , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . while the estimated extinction appears to be rather large , it is not unreasonable considering that the galactic foreground extinction towards m31 is estimated to be @xmath51 @xcite . with the distance modulus of m31 @xmath52 @xcite ,",
    "the absolute magnitude of the source is then @xmath53 , which , combined with its intrinsic color , locates the source on the color - magnitude diagram as a member of the asymptotic giant branch or the red giant branch of metal - rich populations .",
    "this suggests that the source probably lies in the m31 disk rather than the metal - poor spheroid .",
    "the color and the magnitude of the source can be combined to provide an estimate of the angular source radius @xmath54 .",
    "this can be done using an empirical calibration of the color with the surface brightness , such as that of @xcite .",
    "for the source star of pa-99-n2 , the calibration of @xcite , combined with the @xmath46-@xmath55 correlations of @xcite , provides the measurement of its angular radius @xmath56 .",
    "we note that the result is insensitive to the extinction estimate unless the reddening law through the line of sight is abnormal .",

    "@xcite , that is , @xmath61 .",
    "] we also check the result with a different calibration based on @xmath62 @xcite , and get a consistent answer @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding linear radius of the source is @xmath385 r@xmath64 , and the implied surface gravity @xmath65,\\ ] ] is also consistent with the source being a giant .",
    "there is some evidence for the presence of finite source size effects in the lightcurve and this , combined with the above estimate of the angular source size , allows us to infer further properties of the source .",
    "this is explored in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "the optical depths of different lens populations may be used to assess the likely nature of the lens .",
    "the advantage of using the optical depths for this purpose is that they are reasonably robust .",
    "analysis of the timescale or other parameters when available can give further clues as to the nature of the lens , although this is usually more model - dependent . here",
    ", we provide the assessment of the most probable lens population using the optical depth , the observed event duration and the constraints on the lens - source relative proper motion .",
    "each level of assessment exploits more of the available information but requires more model assumptions .",
    "optical depth evaluations require an assumed spatial distribution for the lenses and sources .",
    "we consider the m31 disk and spheroid to be plausible locations for the source and for a stellar lens .",
    "we consider massive compact halo objects ( machos ) in the m31 and the milky way dark haloes to be additional possibilities for the lens . the m31 disk is taken to have a double - exponential density profile with a scale length of 5.8 kpc , scale height of 0.4 kpc and central density of @xmath66 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the spheroid , we adopt the flattened power - law distribution of @xcite with a core radius of 1 kpc and central density of @xmath67 .",
    "the m31 and milky way haloes are taken to be near - isothermal spheres as in @xcite , with both haloes truncated at 100 kpc .",
    "we assume that the machos comprise 20% of the total halo mass @xcite .",
    "the combined mass distribution of the m31 populations provide a good fit to the rotation curve @xcite and to the radially - averaged @xmath2-band surface brightness profile @xcite for reasonable stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "table  [ opticaldepths ] lists the optical depth @xmath68 for the various combinations of lens and source populations . to compute the relative likelihood of the lens and source combinations , the relative density of the spheroid and disk source populations",
    "must be taken into account . at the location of pa-99-n2 ,",
    "the disk surface luminosity density is 4.8 times larger than that of the spheroid for our assumed model .",
    "( strictly speaking , the proper ratio of the source density should be that of the specific surface density constrained by the observed source color and magnitude . due to the lack of a proper local population model of the disk and spheroid stars at the position of pa-99-n2",
    ", we ignore the source magnitude and color measurement . ) after factoring in the relative source densities , we find the most likely scenario for pa-99-n2 is a source star in the m31 disk and a lens in the m31 halo , ( with probability @xmath69 ) followed by the disk self lensing ( @xmath70 ) and lensing of a disk star by a spheroid star ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "a macho is the more likely alternative for the lens than a star , provided that machos comprise no less than 15% of the total halo mass .",
    "however , if we accept that the metal - rich nature of the source implies a denizen of the m31 disk , then the scenario of a lens in the m31 halo becomes slightly more probable ( @xmath72 ) .    to utilize the information on the timescale measurement , further assumptions are required as to the lens and source velocity distributions , as well as the lens mass function .",
    "we assume random velocities to be characterised by a maxwellian distribution with a one - dimensional dispersion @xmath73 40 , 100 , 166 and 156 km s@xmath35 for the m31 disk , spheroid , halo and milky way halo , respectively .",
    "in addition , we include rotational velocity components of 235 and 30 km s@xmath35 for the m31 disk and spheroid , respectively .",
    "m31 stars are assumed to follow the solar - neighborhood mass function , specifically a broken power law where @xmath74 between 0.01 @xmath1  and 0.5 @xmath1  and @xmath75 above 0.5 @xmath1 , with continuity enforced at the knee @xcite . for disk stars the upper mass cut - off is 10 @xmath1 , while for spheroid lenses we assume a 1-@xmath1  cut - off .",
    "the macho mass function is assumed to be a dirac delta function at 0.5 @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that , while we are not in the classical microlensing regime , we can use the classical microlensing rate to compare relative likelihoods .",
    "this is because the einstein timescale is uniquely specified from the fit , and so the pixel - lensing detection efficiency is the same unknown constant for all potential lens populations and can therefore cancels out in any comparison .",
    "similarly , the source magnitude is also specified by the fit , and we therefore do not need to make any assumptions regarding the m31 stellar luminosity function .",
    "table  [ opticaldepths ] then shows the differential microlensing rate per source , @xmath76 , evaluated at @xmath77 .",
    "the most likely scenario for this case is an m31 macho lensing a disk star ( @xmath78 ) , followed by a disk source lensed by a milky way macho ( @xmath79 ) and then disk self lensing ( @xmath80 ) . while this result is broadly consistent with those derived from the optical depth values , the observed timescale lends greater preference to machos as a probable lens population for our assumed model .",
    "note too that if we use differential rates to make the judgement on the origin of the lens , then a macho is more likely than a stellar lens provided machos comprise more than 5% of the m31 and milky way haloes .",
    "figure  [ massestimate ] shows the posterior probability for the lens mass for each combination of lens and source when the timescale information is considered . here ,",
    "for the case of macho lenses , we relax the assumption of a macho being 0.5 @xmath1 .",
    "but , machos are still assumed to be a population with a unique characteristic mass .",
    "if the lens is a macho in the milky way halo , the corresponding 95% confidence interval on its mass is 0.04 - 13 @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , if a compact object in the m31 halo is responsible for the event , its mass is predicted to lie between 0.09 - 32 @xmath1  ( 95% confidence ; the disk source ) or 0.06 - 30 @xmath1  ( 95% confidence ; the spheroid source ) . while both of these mass ranges are quite broad , they tend to favor an interpretation of the macho as a stellar remnant or primordial black hole . on the other hand ,",
    "if pa-99-n2 is a disk self - lensing event , the most probable lens mass is 0.5 @xmath1(which is at the break of the mass function ) , and the associated 95% confidence interval is 0.02 - 3.6 @xmath1 . in this case , the mass of the primary is consistent with it being a typical low mass disk star , and the mass of the secondary lies below the hydrogen - burning limit at better than the 95% confidence limit .",
    "the case of a spheroid source and a disk lens leads to a similar mass estimate ( 0.02 - 4.7 @xmath1 ) , while a spheroid lens results in a somewhat narrower mass range ( 0.02 - 1 @xmath1 ) due to the lowering of the upper mass cut - off compared with the disk mass function .",
    "we have studied the anomaly in the lightcurve of pa-99-n2 .",
    "although there are other possibilities , the assumption of a binary lens provides the most economical explanation of the data .",
    "the lens may lie either in the m31 disk / spheroid or the milky way / m31 haloes .",
    "if the lens lies in the disk / spheroid , the primary is a low mass star .",
    "its companion lies below the hydrogen burning limit with 95% confidence .",
    "this would makes it the most distant brown dwarf so far discovered .",
    "if the lens lies in the halo , then the primary is most probably a stellar remnant and its companion either a brown dwarf or low mass star .",

    "[ binarymodel ] ) with a smaller @xmath9 than that of c1 by 4.9 .",
    "we note that , while the geometry of the binary lens  @xmath26 and @xmath25  has been driven to move along the principal conjugate direction ( towards the smaller @xmath25 ) , the measurements of most other parameters are only minimally affected by the incorporation of the finite source effect .",
    "in particular , the timescale and the source flux are changed only by @xmath83 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than their associated uncertainties .",
    "the limiting value when the finite source fit is no better than the point source fit is @xmath84 ( formally corresponding to @xmath85 ) .",
    "combining this with the measurement of @xmath32 and @xmath54 ( see   [ model ] ) provides us with the constraint on the angular einstein ring size @xmath82 and the lens - source relative proper motion @xmath86 ;    @xmath87    @xmath88    [ eq : cut ]    caution should be used in interpreting these limits , as the uncertainties may not properly include systematic effects such as uncertainty in the color transformations or any possible problems in the photometry for the critical three nights data over which finite source effects are detected .",

    "hence , the numerical values of the differential rates are essentially normalized by the peak value of the probability density for @xmath86 .",
    "we find that the derived proper motion constraint overwhelmingly favors an m31 macho lens with either a disk or spheroid star being a source .",

    "the deviation is consistent with the parallax effect and there are at least four degenerate solutions , listed in tables  [ parallax ] and [ par2 ] .",
    "( this arises because it is only an acceleration with respect to the instantaneous relative velocity of the lens that is detected . )",
    "however , we regard this as a less likely alternative than the hypothesis of a binary lens , even more so than suggested on purely statistical grounds by the @xmath9 difference .    first , using the data in table  [ par2 ] , the projected velocity of the lens on the observer plane ( @xmath107 ) is @xmath320 km s@xmath35 .",
    "we note that this is an upper limit to the lens - source relative velocity .",
    "already this makes it extremely unlikely that the lens resides in the haloes of either the milky way or m31 . only milky way disk stars are likely to have such a small relative velocity .",
    "the distance to the lens belonging to the milky way can be estimated from the parallax , assuming @xmath108 , that is , @xmath109 for a typical lens mass of @xmath30.5 @xmath1 , then the lens distance is @xmath32 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to a vertical height above the galactic plane of @xmath3700 pc .",
    "this is uncomfortably high , as it is twice the scale - height of the thin disk .",
    "the location of the lens can be brought within the scaleheight of the thin disk by increasing its mass to @xmath31 @xmath1 , but such an object would surely be directly imaged if it were a normal star .",
    "the only possibility that seemingly remains is a disk white dwarf .",
    "in addition to the _ a priori _ low probability of lensing by a disk white dwarf , the further objection to this scenario  seeing variation plus parallax effect models  is that it is not consistent with the fixed aperture photometry described in   [ data ] .",
    "this is evident on inspection of figure  [ finallightcurve ] , which shows residuals of the fixed aperture photometry together with a number of the models discussed in the text .",
    "the best fit binary lens model ( c1 ) clearly describes best the pattern of deviations among various alternatives .",
