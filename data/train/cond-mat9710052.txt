    "the interest in nonuniform magnetic fields , with spatial variations on a nanometer scale , has been stimulated by several recent experimental realizations , like magnetic quantum wells @xcite or magnetic superlattices .",
    "@xcite in the quasi - classical regime of low magnetic fields , the theoretical investigations have concentrated on the commensurability oscillations of the resistivity ,  @xcite which are equivalent to the weiss oscillations @xcite that occur in the presence of a periodic electrostatic potential .    the quantum regime of nonuniform magnetic fields with a strong variation of the order of 1 t within a distance of a few hundred nanometers is now experimentally accessible .",
    "@xcite for this regime single - particle quantum mechanical calculations , concerning the tunneling through magnetic barriers or the bound states in magnetic wells , have recently been performed by peeters , matulis , and vasilopoulos .",
    "@xcite coulomb interaction effects have been discussed by wu and ulloa @xcite who studied the electron density distribution and the collective excitations in a magnetic superlattice with a short period , comparable to the average magnetic length .",
    "they found that the periodic magnetic field gives rise to an electron - density modulation , which is reduced due to the counteracting induced electric field .",
    "in the present paper we consider a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a perpendicular magnetic field of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a homogeneous part and @xmath7 is , in the plane of the 2deg , periodic in one direction with zero average .",
    "we describe in detail the charge - density response to the periodic part and the effects of the associated electrostatic potential",
    ". it will be very instructive to compare this situation with the modulation by a unidirectional periodic electrostatic potential @xmath8 ( we include the charge @xmath9 in the definition of the electrostatic potentials , which are therefore rather potential energies ) .",
    "the homogeneous part of the magnetic field is assumed to be strong enough so that a description in terms of landau levels is adequate ; we denote by @xmath10 and by @xmath11 the magnetic length and the cyclotron frequency associated with the uniform field @xmath6 . for a fixed mean electron density @xmath12 ,",
    "the number of relevant landau levels is of the order of the filling factor @xmath13 and thus inversely proportional to the average magnetic field .",
    "we first note that classically a magnetic field - modulated or not - has no influence in thermodynamic equilibrium because it drops out of the integral over momenta in the partition function ( bohr - van leeuwen theorem @xcite ) .",
    "especially a magnetic modulation does not lead to a position dependence of the electron energy , which remains @xmath14 , and does not affect the equilibrium electron density .",
    "in contrast one expects ( e.  g.  from thomas - fermi - theory ) that modulation by an electrostatic potential should lead also to a modulation of the density @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the chemical potential . in the classical limit , i.  e.  for low average magnetic field with @xmath17 , the density response of the 2deg to electrostatic and to magnetic modulations is thus very different",
    ". a pure magnetic modulation does classically not give rise to electrostatic effects , whereas an external electrostatic potential is screened by the induced hartree potential .",
    "however , in the quantum regime of low filling factors the two types of modulation affect the density in a very similar manner : both lift the degeneracy of the landau levels and lead to dispersive bands .",
    "the homogeneous part @xmath6 of the magnetic field restricts the spatial extent of the relevant wavefunctions to the order of the cyclotron radius @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the index of the landau level at the chemical potential ( that is @xmath19 is the largest integer smaller than @xmath20 ; we assume spin degeneracy @xmath21 in this work ) .",
    "if @xmath19 is small the modulation is typically slowly varying on the scale @xmath0 and we can represent the landau levels as functions @xmath22 , varying on the same length scale as the modulation .",
    "the width @xmath23 of these bands is of the order of @xmath24 or @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath25 stand for the amplitude of the modulation of magnetic field and electrostatic potential , respectively . in this situation",
    "we expect that the density is determined by a `` local '' filling factor @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the fermi function . for temperatures satisfying @xmath29 , this must lead to a density modulation of order @xmath30 for both electric and magnetic modulations .    for an electric modulation",
    "it is known that , due to this strong effect of the landau level dispersion on the density , the inclusion of the coulomb interaction in the hartree - approximation ( which we will refer to as the electrostatically self - consistent system ) changes drastically the spectrum of the system for low filling factors .",
    "wulf _ et .",
    "_ @xcite found that , for filling factors not too close to an even - integer value , the self - consistent result corresponds to a nearly perfect screening of the modulating external potential and the landau bands are flat within the order of @xmath31 .",
    "if for even - integer filling factor the chemical potential lies in a gap , the screening is much weaker although still considerable . for potentials strong enough to yield overlapping bands , @xmath32 , the screening around even - integer filling factors becomes nonlinear , featuring two bands touching the fermi level , and the width of the band @xmath19 therefore locked to @xmath33 .    the width of the landau band at the fermi level , however , is the basic element for understanding transport measurements @xcite and a major aim of this work is to investigate its behaviour for a magnetic modulation when electrostatic self - consistency is properly accounted for .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secdm ]",
    "we describe our model and the self - consistency problem in detail . in section [ seclp ]",
    "we treat the case of low filling factors , corresponding to a magnetic modulation varying slowly on the length scale @xmath0 . in section [ secms ]",
    "we discuss the regime of lower average magnetic fields , where the cyclotron radius is not small against the period of the modulation .",
    "the numerical results we present are obtained using the material parameters of gaas , namely the effective mass @xmath34 and the dielectric constant @xmath35 .",
    "the average electron density is fixed to @xmath36 , chosen such that @xmath37 , the period of the modulation is @xmath38 and we consider values of @xmath6 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 corresponding to cyclotron radii between @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we consider an idealized 2deg confined to the plane \\{*r*=(x , y ) } and subject to a magnetic field @xmath43 which ,  @xcite within the plane , is directed in @xmath44-direction , does not depend @xcite on @xmath45 , and has a simple periodic dependence on @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the wave vector of the modulation .",
    "we start with the noninteracting 2deg described by the standard single - electron hamiltonian @xmath49 in which we use the landau gauge for the vector potential , @xmath50 .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath51 depend on @xmath45 only through a plane - wave prefactor , @xmath52 with @xmath53 being a normalization length and @xmath54 the center coordinate .",

    "are oscillator wave functions centered on @xmath54 , also known as landau wave functions @xmath59 , associated with the degenerate landau levels @xmath60 .",
    "the degeneracy is lifted for @xmath61 , and the resulting energy bands @xmath62 , together with the corresponding wave functions , can be obtained by diagonalizing the reduced hamiltonian ( [ reha ] ) in the basis of the landau wave functions .",

    "the single - particle density is given by the formula @xmath72 where @xmath28 denotes the fermi function and @xmath73 accounts for spin degeneracy .",
    "the density determines the electrostatic ( hartree ) potential , which we treat by fourier expansion @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath77 the effective bohr radius . for gaas ,",
    "we assume that the system is electrically neutral such that the average density @xmath12 does not contribute to @xmath79 but only determines the chemical potential contained in the fermi function .",
    "the hartree potential has to be added to the hamiltonian ( [ reha ] ) and gives a contribution @xmath80 to the matrices ( [ mel ] ) . the strongest influence on the induced potential originates from the low fourier components of the density , which are related to the long - range charge fluctuations .",
    "we diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath81 self - consistently with eq .",
    "( [ dens ] ) by a numerical iterative scheme .    to understand the way the system achieves self - consistency , we occasionally consider also a 2deg subject to a homogeneous magnetic field @xmath6 and a cosine electrostatic potential @xmath82 with modulation strength @xmath83 instead of the magnetically modulated system ( [ mmod ] ) .",
    "first - order perturbation theory yields for the electric modulation ( [ vmod ] ) the spectrum @xmath84\\ ] ] with @xmath85 .",
    "in this section we deal with a long - period magnetic modulation , with a strong average magnetic field , such that @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( but not necessarily with @xmath88 ) .",
    "approximate analytical results for both electric and magnetic modulations will be developed for a better understanding of the energy spectra and electron density .",
    "we first describe the properties of the noninteracting system .      treating the magnetic modulation as a perturbation presents some difficulties in this limit , since for nonvanishing @xmath89 and @xmath90 the matrix elements @xmath91 given by eq .",
    "( [ mel ] ) diverge for @xmath92 , while those with @xmath93 are finite and those with @xmath94 vanish .",
    "thus the hamiltonian matrix becomes band - diagonal , and the divergent elements cancel in a complicated way in order to yield finite eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , for @xmath86 an accurate numerical diagonalization requires a large matrix ( [ mel ] ) and the landau level mixing is strong , except if @xmath95 .",
    "this complication does not occur for the electric modulation ( [ vmod ] ) for which the landau wave functions diagonalize the matrix in the long - period limit for any @xmath96 , and first - order perturbation theory gives the _ exact _ energy spectrum for @xmath97 , namely  @xcite @xmath98 .    instead of using standard perturbation theory with respect to the modulation stregth @xmath89",

    "the hamiltonian ( [ apreh ] ) is equivalent to the unperturbed one , eq.([reha ] ) , but with modified center coordinate @xmath100 , cyclotron frequency @xmath110 and magnetic length @xmath111 .",
    "the main effect of the magnetic modulation on the wave functions is the shift ( [ scc ] ) of their center of weight .",
    "we see that , since @xmath112 is independent of @xmath113 , the absolute shift @xmath114 increases with increasing modulation period ( @xmath115 ) at equivalent positions within the period ( i.  e.  for fixed @xmath102 ) except for @xmath106 .",
    "this explains the difficulties with the standard perturbation theory which expands the shifted landau functions with center @xmath116 in the basis of landau functions centered around @xmath54 .",

    "the total width of the bands from ( [ venx ] ) is also obtained from the result ( [ enelpt ] ) of perturbation theory by expansion around @xmath130 up to order @xmath129 .",
    "we see from eqs .",
    "( [ venx],[vdens ] ) that for a long - period cosine _ electric _ modulation the bands follow the potential with constant width and the states are not changed by the modulation ; consequently the density is only affected by the dispersion of the levels via the argument of the fermi function .",

    "_ magnetic _ modulation according to ( [ aplb ] ) the widths of the landau bands increase linearly with @xmath131 and the @xmath100-dependent prefactor of the fermi function in ( [ denexp ] ) does not decrease with increasing period .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the dashed lines show the modulation of the density of the noninteracting system with a magnetic modulation of amplitude @xmath132 for different values of the filling factor between 4 and 6 obtained by sweeping @xmath133 ; the temperature is 1 k , so that @xmath31 is much smaller than @xmath134 .",
    "the density is given in units of @xmath135 so that the mean value of each line equals @xmath136 .",
    "the lines for the even - integer values of the filling factor , @xmath137 , are marked with circles .",
    "they show a cosine form , where the amplitude is larger for @xmath138 than for @xmath139 . this behaviour",

    "( [ denexp ] ) ; since here the chemical potential lies in a gap , the fermi function is either @xmath140 or @xmath141 , and the integral gives to leading order in @xmath109 @xmath142 in the corresponding result for the electric modulation , the factor @xmath89 is replaced by @xmath143 which has a different sign and vanishes for @xmath144 .",
    "the persistence of an finite density modulation at even - integer filling factors for a period much longer than the magnetic length constitutes a major difference between the two types of modulation for strong average magnetic fields . note that the result ( [ dennev ] ) can also be written in the form @xmath145 ( @xmath136 small and even ) where @xmath146 is the magnetic length corresponding to the local field @xmath147 .",
    "this means that we can in the long - period limit think of the magnetic modulation as changing the local degeneracy of the landau levels , thus leading to a modulated density even for spatially constant filling factor ( in this work we use the notion of an @xmath148-dependent filling factor @xmath149 as just counting the number of locally occupied bands , which makes sense of course only in the long - period limit ) .",
    "the dashed lines between the ones with circles in fig .  [ fig1 ] show the behaviour of the density while the @xmath150 level is successively filled . due to the energy dispersion ( [ aplb ] ) and the low temperature ,",
    "the @xmath150 states around @xmath151 are occupied first , forming a region with local filling factor @xmath152 while around @xmath153 we still have @xmath154 until the total filling closely approaches @xmath155 .",
    "since the spatial extent of the wavefunctions is small compared to the period @xmath156 , the difference in density between these two regions is of order @xmath157 .",
    "we observe , however , that within a region of constant local filling factor the density is not constant but follows the cosine shape imposed by eq.([dennev ] ) with @xmath136 replaced by the appropriate local filling factor @xmath149 .      since the density profiles of the noninteracting system correspond , according to eq .",
    "( [ vhnu ] ) , to electrostatic potentials with amplitudes larger than @xmath33 , we expect substantial changes in the spectrum when we take electrostatic self - consistency properly into account , as we do now .",
    "the resulting densities are plotted as solid lines in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] we show results for a magnetic modulation of @xmath158 at filling factors ( a ) @xmath159 , ( b ) @xmath160 and ( c ) @xmath161 corresponding to average fields @xmath162 and @xmath163 , respectively .",

    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] which are discussed in section [ secms - sc ] .    when the total filling factor is small and not too close to an even - integer value , the regions of increased density correspond to the minima of the landau bands ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "therefore the generated hartree potential , which is maximum at maximum electron density , will act to _ reduce _ the dispersion of the not fully occupied band with index @xmath166 . the self - consistent solution yields then a very flat ( `` pinned '' ) band with deviations of only the order of @xmath31 from the chemical potential , and the local filling factor is fractional over the whole period .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) for an odd - integer average filling factor @xmath167 .",
    "the self - consistent potential here has to cancel the dispersion of the not fully occupied level @xmath19 , which is larger than the dispersion of the levels with @xmath168 .",
    "thus the potential is @xmath169 and the dispersion of the levels with @xmath170 is reversed in sign .    for even - integer filling factor , however , according to eq .",
    "( [ dennev ] ) the regions of increased density correspond to maxima of the landau bands , since both @xmath171 and @xmath172 follow the shape of the magnetic modulation with positive sign .",
    "consequently , the potential generated by the density modulation ( [ dennev ] ) _ increases _ the dispersion of the highest occupied band @xmath19 instead of acting against the modulation broadening . if the magnetic modulation is sufficiently weak , the resulting self - consistent potential can be calculated by combining eqs .",
    "( [ denexp ] ) , ( [ vdens ] ) and ( [ vhnu ] ) as @xmath173 ( @xmath136 small and even ) where @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",

    "the next - higher band reaches the chemical potential around @xmath151 and the self - consistent solution ( shown in fig.[fig2 ] ( b ) for @xmath160 ) features a region around @xmath153 where the band @xmath19 is pinned to @xmath16 , a region around @xmath151 where the band @xmath177 is pinned to @xmath16 and a region in between where the chemical potential lies in a gap and the density still follows the cosine shape ( [ dennev ] ) . as described in section [ secin ] , similar effects of electrostatic self - consistency are obtained for an electrically modulated system ,  @xcite but there the bandwidth of the highest occupied band is always reduced compared to the noninteracting results .",
    "then , a modulation strength @xmath178 is needed to produce the formation of pinned regions at even - integer filling factors , whereas in the magnetic case only @xmath179 must be satisfied .    for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) the bands of the noninteracting system do overlap at the fermi level due to the linear increase of their width with @xmath131 . in this situation",
    "the density fluctuations and the induced potentials consist mainly of higher fourier components .",
    "the corresponding wavelengths @xmath180 , with @xmath181 , are comparable to @xmath0 , even though @xmath182 is still satisfied .",
    "we therefore can not discuss the effects of the hartree potential here within the limit of a long period but instead we have to consider the density response for electric modulations with @xmath183 .",

    "in this section we discuss properties of the modulated system obtained when for fixed modulation amplitude @xmath186 the average field @xmath6 is lowered so that we enter the regime where @xmath0 is no longer small compared to the period @xmath156 . in this case",
    "the approximation of the modulation by the first terms of a taylor series breaks down and its actual functional form becomes important .",
    "however , the numerical method outlined in section [ secdm ] is still valid provided that @xmath187 , i.  e.  the total magnetic field @xmath147 is nowhere vanishing .",
    "we consider first the noninteracting system .",
    "the quantity we are most interested in is the amplitude @xmath188 of the landau level @xmath166 at the fermi energy . in fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) ( solid line ) this bandwidth is shown for a weak magnetic modulation @xmath189 and average fields @xmath6 in the range @xmath190 .",

    "this can be understood with the result ( [ enlpt1 ] ) of first - order perturbation theory . using the asymptotic relation between laguerre polynomials and bessel functions we obtain for the bandwidth at the fermi level from ( [ enlpt1 ] ) the formula @xcite @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the bessel function of order @xmath141 , @xmath200 , and @xmath201 .",

    "consequently a seemingly weak modulation strength @xmath212 is sufficient to yield for @xmath213 around a maximum of the bessel function @xmath199 a bandwidth @xmath214 which means that the bands around the fermi level do overlap . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) the bandwidth at the fermi level for a modulation of @xmath158 is plotted ; it is larger than @xmath33 for @xmath215 .",

    ", the bandwidth does not go through a zero at the flat - band condition ( [ fbcm ] ) although its behaviour still resembles the oscillations described by ( [ denfpt ] ) .",
    "for an electric modulation the result corresponding to ( [ denfpt ] ) is @xmath217 with zeros at @xmath218 ( these are the electric flat - band situations ) and the bandwidth is always smaller than @xmath219 . in fig.([fig3 ] ) ( a ) the bandwidth at the fermi level for an electric modulation of amplitude @xmath220 is shown as dashed line ; the modulation amplitude is chosen such that the bandwidths are comparable to the ones induced by the magnetic modulation also depicted in this figure .",

    "the results for the density can be summarized as follows : if the bands around the fermi level do not overlap and @xmath31 is small against @xmath33 and also against the gap between the bands @xmath166 and @xmath227 , then for even - integer filling factor the density is cosine - shaped @xmath228 .",

    "an additional density fluctuation of the order of @xmath223 is produced due to the dispersion of the bands , like in fig .",

    "the density amplitudes resulting from an electric modulation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( c ) .",
    "as discussed in section [ seclpni ] , we find for @xmath235 density fluctutations of order @xmath233 if the level @xmath166 is partially occupied , and essentially no modulation of the density at even - integer filling factors . for lower fields",
    "@xmath6 , however , the density modulation becomes dominated by a cosine contribution whose amplitude is not related to @xmath233 but rather equals the thomas - fermi value @xmath236 since @xmath237 is independent of @xmath6 it appears in the plotted quantity @xmath238 as a linearly increasing background . for the higher temperature",
    "we find that for @xmath234 the density is described accurately by eq .",
    "( [ delrtf ] ) , i.  e.  @xmath239 . for",
    "the lower temperature deviations from this result appear which are of similar magnitude as the corresponding deviations from zero for the magnetic modulation ( except that at even - integer filling factors they do not vanish at the magnetic flat - band condition but only at the electric one ) .",
    "the density modulation for the low temperature and even - integer filling factor is entirely due to the distortion of the occupied wavefunctions and follows very well the formula derived by aleiner and glazman @xcite from first - order perturbation theory .",
    "most important for our purposes is the fact that in any case for @xmath240 there exists an appreciable modulation of the density , whose main part is a wave - function effect and follows the electrostatic potential linearly , independent of the spectrum at the fermi level .",
    "due to the linearity in @xmath241 , it is clear that this applies also to the density response to those higher fourier components of a non - cosine electrostatic potential whose wavevectors @xmath242 satisfy @xmath243 .",
    "having discussed the density response induced by modulated magnetic and electric fields , we now proceed with the investigation of the effects of electrostatic self - consistency for the magnetically modulated system . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) the bandwidth at the fermi level of the self - consistent system and the amplitude of the hartree potential @xmath244 are shown for the same parameters as used in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , respectively .",
    "the bandwidth of the noninteracting system and @xmath33 are also shown for comparison .",
    "we can clearly distinguish the high - field regime ( limited by @xmath245 ) discussed in section [ seclp ] where the spectrum around the fermi level is dominated by the electrostatic effects : instead of the monotonous increase in the noninteracting system the bandwidth at the fermi level is here of order @xmath31 when the filling factor is not close to an even - integer value and has at even - integer filling factors sharp maxima with a height of the order @xmath33 ( this value is reached only for the stronger modulation in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] while in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] eq .",
    "( [ pinkrit ] ) remains valid ) .",
    "the amplitude of the potential equals the difference of the self - consistent and noninteracting bandwidths , reflecting the fact that electrostatic self - consistency is achieved by adjusting the spectrum .    for lower fields with @xmath240 the electrostatic corrections to the bandwidth at the fermi level become much less pronounced and the validity of ( [ denfpt ] )",
    "is eventually restored well before the first magnetic flat - band situation .",
    "the main reason for this is that now the hartree potential is able to affect the density independently of the dispersion at the fermi level .",
    "consequently , self - consistency can be achieved without changing @xmath193 .",
    "we first discuss the weaker modulation without band overlaps ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . here , for the higher temperature , the density modulation produced by the periodic magnetic field is already small without inclusion of the hartree potential so that the self - consistent potential is also minute .",
    "but also for the lower termperature in ( b ) the situation changes around @xmath246 and the bandwidths become close to the noninteracting values , although the amplitude of the self - consistent potential remains appreciable . around @xmath247",
    "an electric flat - band condition is satisfied and the first fourier component of the hartree - potential has no effect on @xmath193 .",
    "therefore here the change of the bandwidth at the fermi level due to the hartree - potential must be small but this is not reflected in the amplitudes of the self - consistent densites and potentials .",
    "for still lower fields , away from the electric flat - band situation , the hartree potential yields again noticeable corrections to the bandwidths but the noninteracting curve remains essentially valid .    for the stronger modulation displayed in fig .",
    "( [ fig6 ] ) , the noninteracting bandwidth at the fermi level is recovered as soon as it gets larger than @xmath33 .",
    "since the bands at the fermi level then overlap , the density modulation consists mainly of higher fourier components with wave vectors @xmath242 , @xmath181 .",
    "the induced potential therefore belongs already to the regime of validity of the linear relation ( [ delrtf ] ) although we still have @xmath248 .",
    "therefore the hartree potential here reduces the density modulation in amplitude but does not much alter its shape , while the bands around the fermi level remain dominated by the cosine form imposed by the periodic magnetic field .",
    "we have calculated the density response of a 2deg in a quantizing magnetic field @xmath6 to a magnetic cosine modulation @xmath249 and compared it with the response to an electric cosine modulation .",
    "we also included self - consistently the induced electrostatic potentials which reduce the density fluctuations .",
    "we investigated in detail the changes in the energy spectrum brought about by the requirement of electrostatic self - consistency .",
    "in contrast to the case of an electric modulation , where the hartree potential always tends to decrease the width of the landau bands , for a magnetic modulation the hartree potential may either decrease or increase the band dispersion , depending on strength and period of the modulation and on the filling factor .",
    "in any case the produced density modulation depends crucially on the temperature .",
    "if @xmath31 is not small compared to @xmath33 the behaviour of the density is quasi - classical , i.  e.  the periodic magnetic field does not lead to an appreciable density modulation , while the density modulation induced by an electrostatic potential essentially follows the thomas - fermi formula . for temperatures satisfying @xmath231 ( which we assume in the remainder of this section ) both types of modulation lead to an appreciable non - classical inhomogeneity of the density and thus to a non - trivial electrostatic self - consistency problem .",
    "we were mainly interested in the effect of the hartree - potential on the spectrum around the chemical potential .",
    "we found that an important parameter is the ratio of the cyclotron radius to the length scale @xmath1 of the density variation .",
    "if the bands in the vicinity of the fermi level do not overlap we have @xmath250 , whereas for overlapping bands the density fluctuations consists of higher fourier components and @xmath1 is significantly smaller than the period @xmath156 of the modulation .",
    "concerning electrostatic effects we can clearly distinguish two regimes by the conditions @xmath251 and @xmath252 .",
    "this defines for fixed total density a distinction between high and lower average magnetic fields .",
    "the value of @xmath6 around which the regime changes depends for a weak modulation only on the period while for a sufficiently strong modulation the transition takes place when the bands start to overlap .    for @xmath1",
    "much larger than the cyclotron radius , i.  e   for high enough @xmath6 , the dispersion of the energy levels is changed drastically by the inclusion of electrostatic self - consistency . as in the case of a purely electrostatic modulation , for which similar screening effects are known ,  @xcite the effective landau bands may be pinned to the fermi level over regions comparable to the period .",
    "the nonuniform magnetic field affects the density also in regions where the chemical potential lies in a gap between two bands . in those regions the density is not constant but reproduces the profile of the magnetic field , since the latter alters the number of states in the vicinity of each center coordinate .    if the cyclotron radius is not small enough against @xmath1 , @xmath252 , the inclusion of electrostatic self - cosistency does not lead to an appreciable change of the dispersion of the bands around the fermi level .",
    "the behaviour of the latter in the regime where @xmath253 can therefore safely be calculated from the noninteracting system .",
