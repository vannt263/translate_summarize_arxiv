    "our understanding of non - perturbative aspects of string theory is still quite limited , although important progress has been made in recent years , thanks , in particular , to work on string dualities and d - branes .",
    "it is very important to consolidate and further this progress .",
    "m - theory  @xcite , a conjectured eleven - dimensional theory which arises as strong coupling limit of type iia string theory , plays a crucial role in this area .",
    "various general features of m - theory are understood  it does not contain a dimensionless coupling constant ( the only parameter in the theory is the eleven - dimensional planck length ) , it reduces to eleven - dimensional supergravity in the low - energy limit and it contains among its excitations m2- and m5-branes , for which a classical action is known .",
    "these classical properties have many non - trivial consequences and implications for non - perturbative string theory .",
    "however , a well established formulation of m - theory in terms of its fundamental degrees of freedom is still lacking . in order to fully exploit the power of m - theory and elucidate its role in establishing a truly non - perturbative picture of string theory , it is crucial to develop a better understanding of the microscopic formulation of the theory including a consistent framework for its quantisation .",
    "the best candidate for such a formulation is currently the matrix model of m - theory .    in this paper",
    "we present a proposal for the study of a sector of m - theory combining the matrix model approach with the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we show how the ads / cft duality can be studied in a genuinely m - theoretic regime by focussing on a particular set of states characterised by a large orbital angular momentum .",
    "taking advantage of the dual description of these states in terms of a cft allows us to independently confirm the results of the matrix model analysis . in this way",
    ", we simultaneously check the validity of both the matrix model proposal and the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the matrix model of m - theory can be considered as a regularised version of the theory describing ( super)membrane degrees of freedom  @xcite  . in this approach",
    "the embedding coordinates of the membrane and their fermionic superpartners are replaced by @xmath24 matrices  .",
    "here we use the letter @xmath25 to avoid confusion with the parameter @xmath4 used in the context of the ads / cft correspondence . ] and the resulting theory describes a quantum mechanical system with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the size of the matrices plays the role of a regulator and the quantum theory of the ( super)membrane is expected to arise in the @xmath26 limit .",
    "the same matrix model is found in type iia string theory as describing the low - energy dynamics of a system of d - particles ( d0-branes )  @xcite . in this context",
    "the size of the matrices is associated with the number of d0-branes . in",
    "@xcite it was conjectured that the @xmath26 limit of this supersymmetric matrix model capture the entire dynamics of m - theory .    a complete and satisfactory understanding of the large @xmath25 limit of the matrix model is still lacking and this represents a major obstacle in establishing it as a viable description of m - theory .",
    "another unresolved issue concerns the emergence of the eleven - dimensional lorentz symmetry  @xcite .",
    "no complete proof that a lorentz invariant quantum theory arise in the large @xmath25 limit is known .",
    "in particular the construction of the matrix model is closely tied to the use of light - front quantisation and no manifestly lorentz - invariant formulation is available .    in order to substantiate the matrix model proposal",
    "it is necessary to address the fundamental issue of identifying proper observables in m - theory and then understanding how to realise them in the matrix model itself .",
    "moreover a concrete scheme for the calculation of such observables should be identified and this is rendered challenging in particular by the absence of a dimensionless coupling constant . the majority of the tests of the matrix model approach to m - theory involve either the low - energy supergravity approximation or compactification to type iia string theory in ten dimensions .",
    "a comprehensive review can be found in @xcite . without considering such limits",
    "it is difficult to decide whether any results obtained from the matrix model are correct , although strong constraints should come from consistency requirements associated with unitarity and lorentz invariance .    in this paper",
    "we propose an approach which brings the ads / cft correspondence into the picture in order to overcome some of these limitations and make progress on these issues .",
    "more specifically the use of the ads / cft dictionary allows us to identify quantities which are dual to cft observables as `` good '' observables in the matrix model .",
    "moreover , being able to independently compute such observables on the two sides of the duality , we are able to justify the results of the m - theory calculations . we will carry out this programme in a sector containing m2-brane states in m - theory , without resorting to a limit in which eleven dimensional supergravity or type iia string theory can be used .",
    "the specific ads / cft duality that we focus on in this paper , which we refer to as the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 correspondence hereafter , was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "it relates m - theory in an ads@xmath7 background to a chern - simons - matter gauge theory with @xmath27 supersymmetry .",
    "this theory , which we will refer to as the abjm theory , has u(@xmath4)@xmath5u(@xmath4 ) gauge group  with level @xmath6 and @xmath28 for the two factors  and was first constructed in @xcite , following previous work  @xcite .",
    "it describes the low - energy limit of the dynamics of @xmath4 coincident membranes in @xmath29 .",
    "the ads@xmath12 background arises as near - horizon geometry of such a stack of m2-branes .",
    "the @xmath30 action is generated by @xmath31 rotations acting simultaneously in the @xmath32 , and @xmath33 planes of @xmath34 in which the @xmath9 is embedded .",
    "we denote the angular momentum generators associated with rotations in these four planes  which can be chosen as basis for the cartan subalgebra of the so(8 ) isometry group of @xmath9  by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively . the @xmath9 can be described as an @xmath37 fibration over @xmath38 , where the @xmath37 has constant radius and is generated at each point by @xmath39 .",
    "this is the @xmath37 which is identified as the m - theory circle  @xcite and the @xmath30 quotient has the effect of dividing the circumference of this circle by @xmath6 . for @xmath40 with @xmath41",
    "fixed the theory is compactified to ten dimensions and reduces to type iia string theory in ads@xmath42  @xcite .",
    "this limit has been extensively studied after the original proposal  @xcite and corresponds to the t hooft limit in the cft , where @xmath4 is large with @xmath43 fixed .",
    "we are instead interested in studying a genuinely eleven - dimensional , m - theoretic , regime where @xmath6 is of order @xmath44 and @xmath4 is large .",
    "one reason to study the m - theory regime of the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 duality is that one hopes to learn about m - theory in this way , as already discussed above .",
    "in particular , since the abjm theory is conjectured to describe the low - energy dynamics of m2-branes , it is natural to ask whether there is a direct connection between this theory and the matrix model .",
    "one of the main results in this paper is to establish a natural and very direct connection between a certain sector of the abjm theory and the pp - wave matrix model first formulated in @xcite .",
    "another motivation for our work comes from the possibility of gaining new insights into fundamental aspects of the ads / cft correspondence by studying it in a regime which is essentially different from what has been considered before .",
    "although the ads / cft duality has been extensively studied , especially in its canonical version relating the @xmath45 supersymmetric yang  mills ( sym ) theory in four dimensions to type iib string theory in an ads@xmath46 background , important open questions remain concerning its foundations . in particular the fundamental mechanism underlying the correspondence",
    "is not fully understood .",
    "analysing a non - stringy ads / cft , of which the m - theoretic regime of the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 duality is a prime example , should help to shed light on this aspect , as certainly in this case the correspondence can not be explained in terms of open / closed string duality .",
    "another important feature of the regime we focus on is that it is not compatible with the use of the planar approximation , since it requires large @xmath4 but @xmath47 , so that @xmath43 can not be fixed .",
    "this is natural as the t hooft expansion suggests that the gauge theory should have a description in terms of string - like degrees of freedom , which is not the case in the m - theory regime .",
    "therefore the sector we consider allows us to analyse the gauge / gravity duality independently of the special role played by the planar approximation .",
    "the duality in the m - theoretic regime is considered to be rather non - tractable . on the cft side ,",
    "the theory is strongly coupled as @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , one can not focus on the planar diagrams and all non - planar contributions are in principle relevant . on the ads side , one has to face the problem of formulating m - theory in ads@xmath48 , in particular when trying to calculate observables including quantum corrections .    in this paper",
    ", we present evidence that when one introduces a large orbital angular momentum , @xmath16 , the presence of the small parameter @xmath10 makes it possible to identify good approximation schemes on both the cft and the ads sides .",
    "we discuss the relevant observables on both sides and establish a dictionary between them .",
    "the spectra computed on the two sides match , verifying the ads / cft conjecture in an m - theoretic regime .",
    "the idea of using a large angular momentum to obtain a workable approximation is natural as the wkb approach is usually applicable in cases where one has large quantum numbers ( in our case @xmath16 ) . in the ads@xmath49/cft@xmath0 context",
    "this idea has been put forward in  @xcite . as first shown by berenstein , maldacena and nastase ( bmn ) in  @xcite",
    ", focussing on a large angular momentum sector leads to a situation in which both sides of the duality are weakly coupled and the ads / cft correspondence is directly testable .",
    "our work is in many ways analogous to the bmn analysis , although with some important differences .",
    "we construct operators in the abjm theory , which play a role analogous to the bmn operators .",
    "the construction of such operators is , however , totally different and this reflects the fact that they correspond to excited states of membranes rather than strings .    on the gravity side of the correspondence",
    "we describe the physics of states in ads@xmath12 which belong to a sector characterised by large angular momentum .",
    "m - theory states are classified by the eigenvalues of the cartan generators @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we focus on states which have large @xmath36 and the other components of the angular momentum of order one .",
    "the dynamics of such states can be described using the maximally supersymmetric eleven dimensional pp - wave geometry to approximate the ads@xmath12 background . following the proposal to use the matrix model as a microscopic formulation of m - theory , it is then natural to adopt as framework for our calculations the pp - wave matrix model @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of our proposal is that the size of the matrices in this matrix model should be identified with @xmath50 .",
    "the possible vacuum states in the large angular momentum sector are the bps states of the pp - wave matrix model , which were studied in @xcite .",
    "the simplest such state is a fuzzy sphere configuration corresponding to a spherical membrane which extends in the ads@xmath0 directions and is point - like in @xmath9 , where it moves along a great circle with large angular momentum @xmath16 . in general the bps states",
    "correspond to a collection of concentric fuzzy spheres , labelled by a set of integers corresponding to the portion of the total angular momentum carried by the individual membranes .",
    "the radii of the fuzzy spheres are proportional to their angular momentum .",
    "the use of the pp - wave approximation is justified if these radii are much smaller than the radius of curvature of the ads@xmath0 and @xmath9 factors in the original background .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath51 for the applicability of the pp - wave approximation .    after describing the ground state in the large @xmath16 sector",
    ", we discuss the spectrum of fluctuations around the classical vacuum configurations following @xcite .",
    "we present the tree level spectrum , which is determined by the pp - wave matrix model hamiltonian at quadratic order in the fluctuations .",
    "we then discuss the behaviour of quantum corrections associated with cubic and quartic terms in the fluctuations  .",
    "the condition that one - loop effects produce small corrections to the tree level result turns out to be @xmath52 it is crucial for our proposal that both conditions , ( [ rfupperboundj ] ) and ( [ rflowerboundj ] ) , can be satisfied for large @xmath4 choosing the parameter @xmath16 so that @xmath53    having discussed the large angular momentum sector on the gravity side using the pp - wave matrix model , we then describe the dual large @xmath16 observables in the cft .",
    "these are gauge - invariant operators in the abjm theory with quantum numbers matching those of the membrane states we discussed .",
    "the requirement of gauge invariance leads to identify monopole operators as dual to membrane states in the large @xmath16 sector .",
    "monopole operators  @xcite , which play a crucial role in the abjm theory and also in three dimensional gauge theory in general  @xcite , are classified by a set of integers , the so - called gno charges  @xcite , which satisfy a dirac quantisation condition  @xcite .",
    "the bps operators we consider in this paper are special cases , characterised by a large r - charge , of those already considered in @xcite and further studied in @xcite .",
    "we show , by focussing on bps or ground states , that it is possible to identify the gno charges of the relevant cft operators with the angular momenta of the dual membrane states associated with motion along the great circle in @xmath9 .",
    "this correspondence was also observed in @xcite .",
    "monopole operators are associated with a dirac monopole singularity at the insertion point . as",
    "such they do not have a simple manifestly local description in terms of the elementary fields in the theory . in order to deal with this complication",
    "it is convenient to use radial quantisation and study the abjm theory on @xmath54 in hamiltonian formulation in the presence of magnetic flux through the @xmath55  @xcite . using the state - operator map we identify the states in the radially quantised abjm theory  in a sector characterised by large magnetic flux , @xmath16  which are dual to membrane excitations in the bulk .",
    "an important ingredient in this construction is the identification of a suitable gauge .    in this framework",
    "the dictionary relating the gravity and gauge sides arises in a natural way , leading to a very direct correspondence .",
    "bulk states corresponding to spherical membranes and their excitations have a dual description in terms of states of the abjm theory on @xmath55 .",
    "therefore states on the two sides of the duality are described in terms of the same spherical harmonics .",
    "the energy spectrum of the membrane excitations , which are in general non - bps , corresponds to the energy spectrum of the abjm theory in radial quantisation .    in the case where the ground state on the gravity side is a single membrane",
    ", we verify that the tree - level spectrum obtained from the matrix model calculation agrees with the leading order result on the cft side for all types of bosonic and fermionic excitations .    despite the fact that the abjm theory is strongly coupled for @xmath47",
    ", we argue that a perturbative expansion is possible using a born - oppenheimer type approximation .",
    "the presence of a large magnetic flux , @xmath16 , induces a separation of energy scales which leads to a natural identification of slow ( or low - energy ) modes and fast ( or high - energy ) modes .",
    "integrating out the fast modes leads to an effective low - energy hamiltonian for the slow modes which is weakly coupled for large @xmath16 .",
    "we propose that this approach provides a framework for the systematic study of quantum corrections in the abjm theory in the large @xmath16 sector that we defined .    in our construction",
    "leading to the formulation of the born - oppenheimer approximation for the large @xmath16 sector of the abjm theory we will assume that it is possible to use the classical action as a starting point to identify the bps states even for small @xmath6 .",
    "this assumption is partially justified by supersymmetry and by the consistency of the results of related work which uses localisation techniques  @xcite in combination with a similar premise .",
    "a full justification of this assumption will be provided a posteriori by the emergence of an expansion in which the effective coupling constant controlling quantum corrections is not the bare @xmath56 , but a combination involving inverse powers of @xmath16 .",
    "a more detailed discussion of these issues is presented in the sections devoted to the analysis of the cft side .",
    "we also discuss the generalisation to the case in which the ground state contains multiple membranes .",
    "the dual cft sector involves monopole operators characterised by multiple non - zero gno charges , corresponding to the angular momenta of the individual membranes . in this case",
    "the pp - wave matrix model vacuum consists of block - diagonal matrices  @xcite .",
    "the excited states built on such vacua involve fluctuations in off - diagonal blocks , which do not correspond to degrees of freedom associated with individual membranes in the continuum .",
    "we will identify the dual states in the abjm theory and show that in some cases  specifically when there are two membranes of approximately the same size and hence close to each other  these extra degrees of freedom on the two sides of the correspondence can be compared reliably and quantitatively within the limits of validity of our approximations . the agreement between",
    "the corresponding spectra is a strong indication that these states describe true degrees of freedom of m - theory , which are captured by the matrix model , but are not present in the conventional continuum membrane theory .",
    "the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 duality proposed in  @xcite has been extensively studied in the type iia regime .",
    "many of the techniques originally developed for the ads@xmath49/cft@xmath0 correspondence have been adapted to this case .",
    "in particular integrability has been exploited in the abjm theory following the early results in  @xcite . for a review see chapter iv.3",
    "@xcite of @xcite .",
    "also , large angular momentum operators ( with vanishing total monopole charge ) in the type iia limit were first studied in  @xcite . in the small @xmath6 regime , on the other hand , localisation techniques were successfully applied to the calculation of the superconformal index in  @xcite .",
    "similar methods have been used to obtain exact results for other bps observables such as the free energy starting with the work of  @xcite .",
    "our analysis is also devoted to the small @xmath6 ( m - theoretic ) regime , however , we focus on non - bps quantities . in the large @xmath16 sector",
    "described above , we develop an approach which makes it possible to systematically study quantum corrections to certain non - bps observables on both sides of the correspondence .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section [ rsads ] we describe the ads side of the correspondence .",
    "we discuss the pp - wave approximation for membranes in ads@xmath12 and present the associated matrix model and its energy spectrum . in section [ rscft ]",
    "we describe the cft side .",
    "we first discuss the hamiltonian formulation of the abjm theory in @xmath54 .",
    "we then explain the separation between fast and slow modes in the framework of the born - oppenheimer approximation and present the energy spectrum in the large @xmath16 sector .",
    "particular attention is devoted to the discussion of gauge - fixing which plays an essential role in our analysis . in the discussion of both sides of the duality we first consider bps states ( ground states ) and",
    "then near - bps states ( fluctuations around the ground state ) , which are not protected and receive quantum corrections . in section [ rsmultimembrane ]",
    "we discuss the case of multi - membrane vacua .",
    "we conclude in section [ rsconclusion ] with a discussion of our results and an outline of possible extensions and generalisations .",
    "in this section , we describe the ads side of the correspondence .",
    "we begin by recalling some basic formulae in m - theory and the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 duality .",
    "m - theory has only one length scale and the membrane tension , @xmath57 , is directly related to the eleven dimensional planck length .",
    "we use the conventions of @xcite in which the planck length is defined so that the einstein - hilbert part of the @xmath58 supergravity action reads @xmath59 the relation between the membrane tension and the planck length is then  @xcite @xmath60 the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 correspondence proposed in  @xcite was constructed considering the near horizon limit of a stack of @xmath4 m2-branes in @xmath29 ( which may be understood as a certain projection of @xmath61 m2-branes in flat space ) .",
    "the resulting geometry is ads@xmath12 , where the radius of the @xmath9 , @xmath62 , in terms of the eleven - dimensional planck length satisfies @xmath63 while the radius of curvature of the ads@xmath0 factor is @xmath64    we shall now specify the kinematical regime we study in this paper . corresponding to rotations in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 planes of @xmath34 in which the @xmath9 is embedded ,",
    "there are four angular momentum quantum numbers , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the states we focus on are those for which one of them , which conventionally we take to be @xmath36 , is large and the other angular momentum quantum numbers are of order @xmath44 .",
    "another important quantum number is @xmath39 .",
    "this is related to the momentum along the m - theory circle , which in the ads@xmath12 background is identified with the great circle ( or rather the family of great circles ) corresponding to the orbit of the @xmath65 generator   plane , the m - theory circle coincides with the equator generated by @xmath36 rotations . ]",
    "the states we are interested in have @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in most instances",
    "we will simply write @xmath16 to refer to either @xmath36 or @xmath65 .",
    "since we focus on the leading order terms in a @xmath10 expansion , the difference will often be irrelevant . when the distinction between the two is relevant , we will explicitly specify whether we are referring to @xmath36 or @xmath65 .    in the following we first consider @xmath69 and",
    "then generalise to the case of @xmath70 , which is obtained via a certain projection .",
    "since the @xmath30 quotient acts on the m - theory circle , the projection requires the @xmath65 quantum number of any individual object to be a multiple of @xmath6 ( while of course @xmath36 can take any integer value ) .",
    "the dynamics of objects ( both point - like and extended , such as strings or membranes ) propagating in a curved geometry with large spatial momentum can be described using an approximation scheme referred to as the pp - wave approximation  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood as an extension of the familiar infinite momentum frame argument ( or the ultra - relativistic limit ) in flat space to the case of a curved background .",
    "as is well known , the dynamics of an object having very large spatial momentum in flat space - time is approximately governed by a free non - relativistic hamiltonian .",
    "if the background space - time is curved , the dynamics of objects with very large spatial momentum , proportional to a parameter @xmath16 , is instead approximately controlled by a non - relativistic hamiltonian containing an external harmonic oscillator potential , whose strength is determined by the curvature radius and by @xmath16 .",
    "the same hamiltonian with a suitable identification of parameters also describes the dynamics of objects in a so - called pp - wave geometry .",
    "there is a limiting process , referred to as penrose limit  @xcite , which produces the pp - wave geometry starting from the original background .",
    "however , we stress that the point of view that we take in this paper is to treat the procedure as an approximation scheme to describe the dynamics of special states in the ads / cft correspondence . rather than viewing the pp - wave background as arising from a formal limit between two geometries ,",
    "we consider it as an approximation which allows to capture the dynamics of states with large spatial momentum propagating in the original space - time  @xcite .",
    "let us recall the essential points of the pp - wave approximation by using a simple example , a massless particle in the space - time @xmath71 with metric @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the line element on the @xmath74-dimensional unit sphere @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the dynamics of the particle is governed by the mass shell condition @xmath77 we temporarily use the indices @xmath78 to label the coordinates of the space - time ( [ rfmetricstr ] ) .",
    "we focus on a great circle in @xmath75 .",
    "we then assume that the particle has large momentum along this fixed circle and does not deviate far from it .",
    "let the spatial coordinate @xmath79 be defined as the angle around the fixed large circle multiplied by the radius @xmath62 .",
    "the longitudinal momentum @xmath80 conjugate to @xmath79 is by assumption large .",
    "we choose the transverse coordinates @xmath81 , @xmath82 , in the directions orthogonal to the great circle . in terms of these",
    "coordinates the metric is approximately @xmath83 neglecting higher order terms in @xmath84 . using ( [ rfmetricstrapp ] ) , the dispersion relation ( [ rfdispertionforsphere ] ) becomes @xmath85 large longitudinal momentum @xmath86 therefore implies large energy @xmath87 .",
    "the finite difference , which plays a role analogous to the light - cone gauge hamiltonian , is given by @xmath88 where we used @xmath89 .",
    "equation ( [ rfppexamplefinal ] ) shows that , for fixed ( large ) longitudinal momentum , @xmath86 , the dynamics of the particle in curved space is approximately that of a non - relativistic harmonic oscillator .",
    "notice that the longitudinal momentum is actually quantised ",
    "@xmath90 , where @xmath16 is an integer  because its conjugate coordinate @xmath79 is periodic with period @xmath91 .",
    "therefore in this approximation @xmath92 equation ( [ rfmetricstrapp ] ) is valid if @xmath93 .",
    "classically one can assume a particle to remain arbitrarily close to the fixed great circle .",
    "however , in the quantum theory the wave function of the particle has finite extension . for the @xmath74-th excited state",
    ", the extension can be estimated using  ( [ rfppexamplefinal ] ) and @xmath90 , @xmath94 hence we see that the condition @xmath95 , which validates the use of the pp - wave approximation , gives an upper bound on the excitation number , @xmath96 and also implies @xmath97    another way of understanding the above formulae is in terms of a centrifugal potential . because of the large angular momentum , the particle experiences a strong centrifugal force confining it around the equator ( where the radius of the trajectory is the largest  the centrifugal force pushes objects in the direction where the radius becomes larger ) .",
    "the pp - wave approximation keeps the leading order term in this centrifugal potential , which as expected has the harmonic oscillator form .",
    "the strength of the potential is determined by the curvature radius of the background and the ( angular ) momentum .",
    "the use of the pp - wave approximation in the context of the ads / cft correspondence involves an additional subtlety . in order to have a consistent dictionary between the gravity and cft sides ,",
    "it is necessary to change the space - time picture on the ads side to the one given in @xcite which is particularly suited for studying holographic aspects ( _ i.e .  _",
    "the computation of correlation functions following the prescription in  @xcite ) .",
    "more specifically , one should not consider objects ( particles , strings or membranes ) propagating in the ads space ( with oscillating wave functions ) , but rather one should consider objects undergoing a tunnelling process ( with exponentially decreasing or increasing wave functions ) . in practice",
    "this is achieved by a certain double wick rotation .",
    "this prescription was proposed in  @xcite for the pp - wave approximation to string theory in ads@xmath46 .",
    "it solves various puzzles regarding the signature of the bulk / boundary , including the identification of energy and conformal dimension and the signature of vector type fluctuations .",
    "although the new interpretation is different leading to a better , consistent correspondence , the end result of the pp - wave approximation is mathematically equivalent  @xcite . both of the interpretations , with or without the double wick rotation , lead to the same effective hamiltonian in the pp - wave approximation .",
    "this is the case even for more general backgrounds corresponding to near horizon limits of d@xmath98-brane configurations  @xcite .",
    "the same interpretation has also been applied to the computation of correlation functions using methods derived from the study of integrable systems in  @xcite .",
    "we shall not elaborate on this issue any further and we refer the reader to  @xcite for additional details . in the following",
    "we assume that the identification of observables between the gravity and cft sides of the correspondence is made adopting the prescription discussed in these papers .",
    "applying the above considerations to the study of m - theory in ads@xmath7 , we conclude that the dynamics of states with large angular momentum in this background can be described using a suitable pp - wave approximation .",
    "combining this idea with the matrix model proposal leads us naturally to use a matrix model which has the same form as the one arising in the maximally supersymmetric eleven - dimensional pp - wave geometry  @xcite .",
    "this matrix model was first proposed in  @xcite and it was later derived in  @xcite from the regularisation of the supermembrane theory in the pp - wave background .",
    "this matrix model is the main ingredient in our analysis of the gravity side of the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 duality .",
    "our discussion in this section is based on a reinterpretation of previous results on the pp - wave matrix model  @xcite . in the spirit of using the pp - wave background as an approximation scheme to study a large angular momentum sector of m - theory in ads@xmath48 ,",
    "we will write the matrix model in terms of parameters characterising the original geometry , _ i.e.  _ the radii @xmath62 and @xmath99 , and the angular momentum parameter @xmath16  , as commonly done in the literature .",

    "quantised @xmath230 super yang - mills theory similar to our construction was considered in  @xcite . ]",
    "it is essential that we use large but finite @xmath231 matrices on the ads side .",
    "this is in particular crucial in establishing the map relating bps states on the two sides of the duality , which are classified by a set of integers  associated respectively with the angular momenta of individual membranes in the matrix model and with gno charges of monopole operators in the cft .",
    "the fact that we can formulate a duality with the abjm theory using finite dimensional matrices is interesting . in this respect",
    "our construction is different from the standard approach to the matrix model description of membranes  @xcite , in which the size of the matrices plays the role of a regularisation parameter and should be taken to infinity .",
    "the matrix model seems to describe a theory in which the membranes are discretised .",
    "this is reminiscent of the description of gauge invariant operators dual to closed strings in terms of a discrete spin chain in versions of the ads / cft correspondence in which the gravity dual is a string theory .",
    "a consequence of working with matrices of finite size is the presence of an upper bound on the mode numbers in the expansion of the fluctuations in spherical harmonics .",
    "we have seen that a corresponding cut - off naturally arises on the cft side in the context of the born - oppenheimer approximation . here",
    "it follows from the fact that it is not completely justified to treat as low - energy modes the high momentum components of the slow modes with energies higher than the mass of the fast modes .",
    "the implications of the direct nature of the duality we have presented are particularly intriguing in the case studied in section [ rsmultimembrane ] , where there are multiple concentric spherical membranes of approximately equal radius . in this situation we have seen that the block off - diagonal degrees of freedom of the matrix model have as counterpart in the dual abjm theory certain off - diagonal components of the fields .",
    "the block off - diagonal degrees of freedom do not exists in the conventional continuum membrane theory , which does not take into account the possibility that membranes possess non - abelian degrees of freedom .",
    "the fact that their spectrum appears to be reproducible in the cft suggests that these degrees of freedom should not be considered as spurious , or a kind of `` lattice artefact '' .",
    "instead they seem to be the manifestation of a genuinely non - abelian nature of membranes in m - theory .",
    "this is a new and non - trivial insight into the dynamics of m - theory that can be deduced from the study of the ads / cft correspondence",
    ". it would be also interesting to understand this non - abelian nature of membranes directly from the matrix model without relying on the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "this presumably will help to shed light on a possible non - abelian born - infeld type description of membranes .",
    "another interesting feature of the abjm theory which emerges from our analysis is the following .",
    "let us consider the case in which only one membrane is present on the ads side and correspondingly only the first gno charge is non - zero on the cft side . in this case , as we have seen in section [ rscftnearbps ] , the excitation of the @xmath232 components of the abjm fields is identified with the excitation of phonons on the stable spherical membrane . on the other hand , the excitations of ( diagonal ) components in the lower right @xmath233 block",
    "would in general give rise to other non - zero gno charges .",
    "we should interpret this as the creation of additional membranes  , as the momenta / gno charges of the created membranes may not be large . ] .",
    "thus the abjm theory combines the features of a first - quantised and a second - quantised description of membranes in this manner .    at the end of section  [ rscftperturbation ]",
    "we have presented the estimate  ( [ rfcft2couplingpowers ] ) for the behaviour of loop corrections in the abjm theory in terms of powers of @xmath4 . however , an intriguing possibility is to retain the @xmath234 combination , which has an interesting explanation in terms of the gravity dual . in our interpretation of the abjm theory in the large @xmath16 sector",
    "the slow modes correspond to the membrane fluctuations studied in section  [ rsads ] .",
    "the ads@xmath12  background is obtained as the near horizon geometry of a stack of @xmath4 membranes .",
    "one can think of the fluctuations as coming from excitations of the original @xmath4 background membranes . then for a state containing a single excited membrane the background comprises only the remaining @xmath234 membranes .",
    "it may be possible to interpret the @xmath234 fast modes as corresponding to the background associated with these @xmath234 membranes .",
    "this picture is also consistently generalised to the case of multi - membrane configurations on the gravity side , which is related to a sector of the cft with multiple non - zero gno charges .",
    "for instance in the case of two membranes / gno charges briefly discussed in section  [ rsmultimembrane ]  at least if the two membranes have comparable angular momenta  the fast modes can be combined into groups of @xmath235 fields .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that on the ads side we have two excited states leaving a background of @xmath235 membranes .",
    "the general analysis of perturbative corrections in section  [ rscftperturbation ] suggests the possibility of the emergence of a novel type of large @xmath4 expansion in the abjm theory for @xmath236 . we have provided a prescription for determining the dependence on powers of @xmath234 in the single membrane sector .",
    "this involves drawing feynman diagrams in the standard double line notation and then specifying for all index loops whether they carry a colour index @xmath44 or a primed index taking values @xmath237 .",
    "the different perturbative contributions can be classified according to the power of @xmath234 they produce .",
    "this power is given by the number of index loops carrying primed colour indices .",
    "the resulting large @xmath4 expansion is different from the standard t hooft expansion .",
    "moreover , the general considerations on the structure of the diagrammatic corrections to the spectrum discussed in section  [ rscftperturbation ]  and specifically the expected cancellations due to supersymmetry  suggest a relation between the order in the loop expansion and the powers of @xmath234 , which is inherently new ( see for example ( [ rfcft2couplingpowers])-([rfcftcounterpartofloopexpansion ] ) ) .",
    "it is well - known that if one focusses on the contribution of planar diagrams in the t hooft expansion , a theory often simplifies and shows various special properties",
    ". it would be interesting to study whether the leading order contributions in this new type of large @xmath4 expansion have similar special properties .",
    "it is intriguing to speculate that the emergence of this new type of large @xmath4 expansion may be related to the fact that we are considering a genuinely m - theoretic regime . in the sector under consideration",
    "the elementary degrees of freedom on the gravity side are not strings , whereas the standard t hooft expansion suggests strongly a stringy interpretation for the fundamental degrees of freedom .    the most important next step in our program will be to compute the higher order corrections in the spirit of the born - oppenheimer approximation discussed in section  [ rscftperturbation ] .",
    "the calculation is quite involved as the gauge - fixed hamiltonian , obtained iteratively solving the gauss law constraints , contains a very large number of interaction vertices",
    ". therefore it will be crucial to develop techniques to simplify the computations .",
    "although the gauge adopted in this paper seems to be well - suited to clarify the structure of the physical degrees of freedom , there may be more convenient choices for explicit loop computations",
    ". the situation may be analogous to the well - known case of yang - mills theories when the gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken via the higgs mechanism . in that case",
    ", the unitary gauge is well - suited for studying the spectrum of the theory , but there are other gauge choices which are more convenient to perform loop computations .",
    "the spectrum of the slow modes and the effective theory governing their dynamics discussed in section  [ rscft ] should be highly constrained by supersymmetry .",
    "it is important to concretely study the restrictions imposed by supersymmetry .",
    "this should also facilitate the explicit computation of quantum corrections .",
    "a formulation using superfields , adapted to the large @xmath16 sector , might be useful in this respect . as discussed in section  [ rscftperturbation ] ,",
    "the results on the ads side of the correspondence indicate the presence of cancellations leading to certain patterns in the structure of higher order perturbative corrections in the cft",
    ". it will be important to explore this structure directly in the abjm theory by carrying out calculations of loop corrections to the spectrum .",
    "an efficient computational scheme may arise from the adaptation of the methods based on localisation to the study of the sector we focussed on .",
    "the localisation approach relies on the existence of a nilpotent supercharge which annihilates the observables under consideration .",
    "as such the method is only applicable to bps quantities which are invariant under at least one supersymmetry . to implement the method one deforms the abjm theory by the addition of terms invariant under the relevant supercharge .",
    "the deformation is controlled by a parameter in such a way that when the parameter is sent to infinity a saddle point approximation becomes exact , allowing an explicit evaluation of the observables .",
    "the main focus of our investigation are non - bps states and for this reason in order to study their spectrum we have relied on a different approximation scheme that arises for large @xmath16",
    ". however , the observables we have considered  similarly to the bmn operators in the @xmath45 supersymmetric yang - mills theory  are near bps , with @xmath10 acting as the parameter measuring their deviation from exactly bps observables . in view of this",
    "it might be possible to generalise the localisation approach to make it applicable to near - bps observables . in this case",
    "the deformation parameter can not be sent strictly to infinity , because the observables are not invariant under the deformation . however , for a carefully chosen deformation , we expect the variation of near bps observables such as those studied in this paper to be suppressed by a power of @xmath10 .",
    "it should then be possible to take the deformation parameter to be as large as a positive power of @xmath16 and evaluate near bps observables using a saddle point approximation , including higher order terms in an expansion in @xmath10 .",
    "this approach may potentially have many applications beyond the large @xmath16 sector of the abjm theory and it would be interesting to test this idea in simple models .",
    "the sector we have discussed provides a setting for the study of the interactions responsible for processes involving the splitting or joining of membranes .",
    "this is a central and still little understood aspect of the dynamics of m - theory and the pp - wave matrix model , together with its dual description in terms of the abjm theory , appears to be particularly suited to investigate it .",
    "the perturbative vacua on the gravity side , which correspond to configurations with varying numbers of membranes , actually belong to the same hilbert space of the matrix model .",
    "in other words , as is well - known , the matrix model should be interpreted as a second - quantised theory of membranes  @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to compute transition amplitudes between two states ( either `` vacua '' or excited states ) characterised by different sets of integers as already mentioned in section [ rsadsbps ] .",
    "these transition amplitudes are analogous to the string field theory vertices in the ten - dimensional pp - wave background and thus should provide the building blocks for the computation , from the dual gravitational perspective , of @xmath74-point correlation functions of the operators we defined via the state - operator map .",
    "analogous computations for the three - point functions of bmn operators have been done in string theory .",
    "for a recent reference , see  @xcite . for an analysis of the relation between",
    "the transition amplitudes ( or the string vertex ) and the cft ope coefficients , see  @xcite .",
    "it is important to determine the coupling constant governing these processes , which should correspond to tunnelling amplitudes . in this paper",
    "we have assumed this coupling to be small .",
    "it is tempting to conjecture that it may be given by a certain combination of powers of @xmath238 and @xmath16 .",
    "it is also an interesting problem to compute three - point functions of operators with non - zero monopole charges , such as those considered in this paper , directly on the cft side .",
    "this is presumably related to the tunnelling process discussed at the end of section  [ rscftbps ] .    in this paper",
    "we studied the m - theory regime in which the parameter @xmath6 is of order @xmath44 .",
    "it is of some interest to consider whether there is a type iia regime ( @xmath239 with @xmath41 fixed ) in which a description similar to the one given in this paper based on the pp - wave approximation is possible .",
    "an essential difference in the type iia regime is that , since the m - theory circle is small , m2-branes wrapped on the m - theory circle should also be considered . to incorporate these degrees of freedom",
    "it seems appropriate to use the matrix string formulation  @xcite .",
    "several works have studied aspects which are relevant for this line of investigation .",
    "a direct map identifying the degrees of freedom associated with wrapped membranes in matrix string theory was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "the matrix string theory on a type iia supersymmetric pp - wave background was constructed in  @xcite .",
    "an m2-brane solution in the type iia regime , which is wrapped around the m - theory circle and has torus topology , was found in  @xcite . wrapped m5-brane solutions related to the wrapped m2-brane solutions",
    "were discussed in  @xcite .",
    "considerations on the cft counterparts of these solutions were presented in @xcite . there may be connections to bps solutions of the membrane theory on the pp - wave background with arbitrary genus found in  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the pp - wave approximation for string states in the type iia limit with zero monopole charge was studied in @xcite .    in recent years methods",
    "derived from the study of integrable systems have played an important role in the computation of corrections to the spectrum on both sides of the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite . a question that arises is whether integrability can be relevant in the sector of the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 duality that we considered in this paper .",
    "the consensus is that integrability in the ads / cft correspondence is a feature arising only in the planar approximation .",
    "this seems to indicate that it should not be expected in the m - theoretic regime .",
    "however , since we are dealing with a theory of membranes rather than strings , the significance of the planar approximation is unclear .",
    "an interesting possibility is that integrability might arise in the large @xmath16 sector of the abjm theory if one focusses on the leading contributions in the novel large @xmath4 expansion that we described above .",
    "moreover , extending the ideas developed in the context of stringy examples of ads / cft duality , it is natural to expect that the relevant integrable systems in a case involving membrane degrees of freedom might be @xmath240 dimensional .",
    "these considerations lead us to suspect that , if integrability can play a role in the present context , it should present interesting new features .",
    "as already noted above constraints from supersymmetry will presumably play a crucial role in better understanding the structure of the abjm theory in the large @xmath16 regime . for @xmath241 supersymmetry",
    "is expected to be enhanced to @xmath242 .",
    "the extra supersymmetries are related to the presence of monopole operators and some of the associated r - currents are already known  @xcite . more concretely , the part of the @xmath242 supersymmetry algebra broken for @xmath243 corresponds to generators transforming under @xmath244 with charge @xmath245 .",
    "since the monopole charge , @xmath244 , is a multiple of @xmath6 , these charges can not exists for @xmath246 and this explains why the @xmath242 supersymmetry is broken down to @xmath27 for @xmath246 . in section  [ rscftnearbps ]",
    "we have focused on states with given @xmath244 in the gauge - fixed theory .",
    "it seems to be straightforward to relax this restriction . since @xmath244 is a conserved charge ,",
    "the hilbert space of the abjm theory can be viewed as the direct sum of the vector spaces of states with fixed @xmath65 .",
    "the action of the full superalgebra , including the supercharges that change the value of @xmath244 by @xmath247 units , spans the entire hilbert space of the theory relating states with different quantum number @xmath244 . since our gauge has the advantage of being very explicit , it should be possible to use it to write down the supercharges for the full @xmath242 supersymmetry , at least at the classical level",
    ". it would be interesting to do this and study their commutators to explicitly verify the closure of the @xmath248 superalgebra .",
    "the mechanism of the breaking of @xmath242 supersymmetry explained above helps to clarify why the pp - wave matrix model has 32 real supersymmetries  @xcite . at leading order in the pp - wave approximation order @xmath44 differences in the value of @xmath249 can not be detected .",
    "hence it is natural to expect that the @xmath242 supersymmetry of the matrix model for arbitrary @xmath6 should be interpreted as an approximate symmetry , which would be broken by the inclusion of corrections to the pp - wave approximation . in a similar fashion",
    "the low - energy sector that we identified in the abjm theory for large @xmath16 should possess an approximate @xmath242 supersymmetry even for @xmath250 .",
    "it would be interesting to study concretely these aspects , analysing the corrections to the pp - wave approximation on the gravity side and the symmetries of the low - energy effective theory for the slow modes on the cft side .",
    "following the abjm proposal there have been many generalisations leading to other examples of ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 dualities with less supersymmetry .",
    "it should be possible to extend our analysis to these cases as well .",
    "the approach and the techniques we have developed in this paper will also be useful more generally in the study of various properties of three - dimensional conformal chern - simons - matter theories , irrespective of whether or not they have gravity duals .",
    "more specifically , the born - oppenheimer type approximation we have discussed in section  [ rscft ] provides a new approach to the computation of conformal dimensions of various types of operators with large monopole charge , which may be applicable in situations where a conventional perturbative expansion is not justified .",
    "the work presented in this paper has interesting connections to the little understood @xmath251 superconformal field theory in six dimensions .",
    "this theory , which is believed to describe the low - energy dynamics of a stack of m5-branes , is expected to have as gravity dual m - theory in an ads@xmath252 background .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the application of the pp - wave approximation to this background leads to the same geometry as the one obtained from ads@xmath144  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the six - dimensional @xmath251 theory should contain a sector dual to the matrix model we have considered for which a weak coupling description might be possible .",
    "since m2- and m5-branes are electromagnetic duals of each other in the eleven dimensional target space of m - theory , one may expect the m2-brane excitations discussed in section  [ rsadsfluctuation ] to be captured by solitonic degrees of freedom in the @xmath251 theory .    according to the proposal of  @xcite",
    "there are states in the pp - wave matrix model which have dual descriptions as m5- or m2-branes .",
    "for instance a configuration characterised by a partition @xmath253 can be identified with a single m5-brane .",
    "the pp - wave approximation should be applicable to such m5-branes as discussed in section [ rsads ] , since they carry large angular momentum and their size is small . even if they can not be treated perturbatively in the matrix model ,",
    "it is possible that they can be studied by a monte - carlo simulation or by devising an appropriate approximation scheme such as a variational method",
    ". it would be interesting if one could gain any insights into the dynamics of m5-branes using the pp - wave matrix model and its dual description in terms of the abjm theory .",
    "we have seen that the large @xmath16 limit seems to provide a good framework in which concepts from m - theory  and its matrix formulation  and the ads / cft duality work together .",
    "we hope that the interplay of these ideas may lead to a better understanding of both m - theory and the ads / cft correspondence .",

    "<S> this provides a highly non - trivial test of the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 correspondence including near - bps observables associated with membrane degrees of freedom , therefore extending the validity of the ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 duality beyond the previously studied sectors corresponding to either bps supergravity observables or the type iia string regime .    </S>",
