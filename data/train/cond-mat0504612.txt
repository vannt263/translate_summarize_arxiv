    ", the two - body interaction can be characterized by the 2d scattering length @xmath9 which was calculated as a function of the 3d scattering length in @xcite .",
    "we recall that @xmath9 is always strictly positive and the 2d two - body problem in free space exhibits a bound state , that is a dimer , of spatial radius @xmath9 . for the 2d gas to have universal many - body interaction properties , characterized by @xmath10",
    "only , one requires that the spatial extension @xmath11 of the ground state of the harmonic oscillator along @xmath5 is smaller than @xmath9 @xcite , so that e.g.  the dimer binding energy is smaller than @xmath6 .",
    "the weakly attractive fermi gas limit corresponds in 2d to @xmath12 and the condensation of preformed dimers to @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the 2d density of the gas .    in the @xmath8 plane ,",

    "then one gradually sets the trapping potential into rotation around @xmath5 axis with an instantaneous rotation frequency @xmath18 , until it reaches a maximal value @xmath19 to which it then remains equal .",
    "the question is to study the resulting evolution of the gas and predict the possible formation and subsequent crystallization of quantum vortices .",
    "we shall consider this question within the approximate frame of the bcs theory , in a rather strongly interacting regime but closer to the weakly interacting bcs limit than to the bec limit , which is most relevant for the present 3d experimental investigations : the chemical potential @xmath20 of the 2d gas is supposed to be positive , excluding the regime of bose - einstein condensation of the dimers , and the parameter @xmath21 , where the fermi momentum is defined as @xmath22 , is larger than unity but not extremely larger than unity : we shall take @xmath23 in the numerical simulations . in this relatively strongly interacting regime",
    ", we of course do not expect the bcs theory to be 100% quantitative .    in the hydrodynamic approach to come",

    "the square box defining the periodic boundary conditions is supposed to be fixed in the rotating frame , so that it rotates in the lab frame : this may be useful in practice to ensure that truncation effects due to the finite size of this box in the numerics do not arrest the rotation of the gas .",
    "this lattice model is expected to reproduce a continuous model with harmonic trapping and zero range interaction potential in the limit of an infinite quantization volume ( @xmath58 spatial radius of the cloud ) and in the limit of a vanishing grid size @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) . in this limit @xmath33",

    ", we have checked that bcs theory for the lattice model gives the same equation of state as eq.([eq : eos ] ) @xcite .",
    "in the hydrodynamic theory of a pure superfluid with no vortex , one introduces two fields , the total spatial density of the gas , @xmath61 , and the phase of the so - called order parameter , @xmath62 . in the bcs theory for the lattice model ,",
    "the order parameter is simply @xmath63 which has a finite limit when @xmath59 . the superfluid velocity field in the lab frame",

    "the first equation is simply the continuity equation in the rotating frame , including the fact that the velocity field in the rotating frame differs from the one in the lab frame by the solid body rotational term .",
    "when one takes the gradient of the second equation , one recovers euler s equation for a superfluid .",
    "these superfluid equations are expected to be correct for a slowly varying density and phase , both in space ( as compared to the size of a bcs pair ) and in time ( as compared to @xmath68 ) . for a harmonically trapped system with a quantum of oscillation @xmath69 , the slow spatial variation condition requires a gap parameter @xmath70 : in the present paper , considering the rather strongly interacting regime @xmath71 , the gap is of the order of the fermi energy , which is much larger than @xmath69 , so that there is slow spatial variation as long as no vortex enters the cloud .",
    "the gap is then much larger than @xmath72 over the ramping time of the trap rotation , so that the expected condition of slow time variation is also satisfied . in the appendix [ appen : hydro ] we present a simple but systematic derivation of these superfluid hydrodynamic equations starting from the time dependent bcs theory and using a semi - classical expansion .",
    "surprisingly , for the case of slow ramping times and rather fast rotations considered in this paper , with @xmath19 of the order of @xmath73 , our simple derivation requires an extra validity condition , in general more stringent than @xmath74 : the quantum of oscillation @xmath75 should be smaller than @xmath76 , a condition also satisfied in our simulations .",
    "we shall assume here that the rotation frequency is ramped up very slowly so that the density and the phase adiabatically follow a sequence of vortex free stationary states .",
    "the strategy then closely follows the one already developed in the bosonic case @xcite : one solves analytically the corresponding stationary hydrodynamic equations , then one performs a linear stability analysis of the stationary solution .",
    "the apparition of a dynamic instability suggests that the system may evolve far away from the stationary branch ; that this dynamic instability results in the entrance of vortices will be checked by the numerical simulations of section [ sec : simul ] .    in the stationary regime , for a fixed rotation frequency @xmath19 , one sets @xmath77 in eq.([eq : continuity ] ) and @xmath78 in eq.([eq : euler ] ) @xcite .",
    "we first consider the 2d case and we replace @xmath24 by the equation of state eq.([eq : eos ] ) : apart from an additive constant , @xmath24 is proportional to the density , as was the case for the weakly interacting condensate of bosons @xcite , so that the calculations for the superfluid fermions are formally the same , if one replaces the coupling constant @xmath79 of the bosons by @xmath80 .",
    "since the properties of the bosons do not depend on the value of @xmath79 up to a scaling on the density @xcite , the results for the bosons can be directly transposed .",
    "following @xcite , we take the ansatz for the phase : @xmath81 which is applicable for a harmonic trapping potential @xmath82 . when inserted in eq.([eq : euler ] ) , this leads to an inverted parabola for the density profile , resulting in an elliptic boundary for the density of the cloud . upon insertion of the density profile in the continuity equation",
    ", one recovers the cubic equation of @xcite : @xmath83 this equation has one real root for @xmath19 below some @xmath84 dependent bifurcation value @xmath85 , and has three real roots for @xmath86 . in the considered stirring procedure ,",

    "we recall briefly the calculation procedure : one introduces initially arbitrarily small deviations @xmath94 and @xmath95 of the density and the phase from their stationary values ; one then linearizes the hydrodynamic equations eq.([eq : continuity ] ) and eq.([eq : euler ] ) to get @xmath96 where @xmath97 and where we used the fact that the laplacian of @xmath98 vanishes .",
    "one then calculates the eigenmodes of the linearized equations , setting @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the eigenfrequency of the mode . as an ansatz for @xmath101 and @xmath102",
    ", one takes polynomials of arbitrary total degree @xmath103 in the variables @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "one can indeed check that the subspace of polynomials of degree @xmath104 is stable , since the stationary values @xmath14 and @xmath105 are quadratic functions of @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this turns the linearized partial differential equations into a finite size linear system whose eigenvalues can be calculated numerically .",

    "each degree contributes to this diagram in the form of a crescent , touching the horizontal axis ( @xmath93 ) with a broad basis on the right side and a very narrow tongue on the left side @xcite . for the low value @xmath90 considered in the numerical simulations of this paper , the lyapunov exponents in the tongues are rather small , so that significant instability exponents are found only in the broad bases : for increasing @xmath19 , the first encountered significant instability corresponds to a degree @xmath111 : for @xmath93 , the corresponding minimal value of @xmath89 is @xmath112 @xcite .",

    "a first typical length scale of variation of the matrix elements in eq.([eq : uvt ] ) comes from the position dependence of @xmath191 : in the absence of rotation , we assume that this is the thomas - fermi radius @xmath192 of the gas , defined as @xmath193 .",

    "<S> the interaction energy of the gas was measured on both sides of the feshbach resonance @xcite ; on the side of the resonance with a positive scattering length , bose - einstein condensation of dimers was observed @xcite ; on the side of the resonance with a negative scattering length , a condensation of pairs was revealed in the strongly interacting regime by a fast ramping of the magnetic field across the feshbach resonance @xcite . also , the presence of a gap in the excitation spectrum was observed @xcite , for an excitation consisting in transferring atoms to an initially empty atomic internal state , as initially suggested by @xcite , revealing pairing .    are there evidences of superfluidity in these fermionic gases  ? </S>",
    "<S> it was initially proposed @xcite to reveal superfluidity by detecting an hydrodynamic behavior in the expansion of the gas after a switching - off of the trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> such an hydrodynamic behavior was indeed observed @xcite but it was then realized that this can occur not only in the superfluid phase , but also in the normal phase in the so - called hydrodynamic regime , that is when the mean free path of atoms is smaller than the size of the cloud , a condition easy to fulfill close to a feshbach resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the general experimental trend is now to try to detect superfluidity via an hydrodynamic behavior that has no counterpart in the normal phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a natural candidate to reveal superfluidity is therefore the detection of quantum vortex lattices in the rotating trapped fermi gases : the superfluid velocity field , defined as the gradient of the phase of the order parameter , is irrotational everywhere , except on singularities corresponding to the vortex lines , so that a superfluid may respond to rotation by the formation of a vortex lattice @xcite ; on the contrary , a rotating hydrodynamic normal gas is expected to acquire the velocity field of solid - body rotation and should not exhibit a regular vortex lattice in steady state .    </S>",

    "<S> a central point of the paper is to identify possible nucleation mechanisms of the vortices that could show up in a real experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> this problem was addressed a few years ago for rotating bose gases . </S>",
    "<S> the expected nucleation mechanism was the landau mechanism , corresponding to the apparition of negative energy surface modes for the gas in the rotating frame , for a rotation frequency above a minimal value ; these negative energy modes can then be populated thermally , leading to the entrance of one or several vortices from the outside part of the trapped cloud @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first experimental observation of a vortex lattice in a rotating bose - einstein condensate revealed however a nucleation frequency different from the one of the thermal landau mechanism @xcite and was suggested later on to be due to a dynamic instability of hydrodynamic nature triggered by the rotating harmonic trap @xcite , which was then submitted to experimental tests @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the discovered mechanism of dynamic instability was checked , by a numerical solution of the purely conservative time dependent gross - pitaevskii equation , to lead to turbulence @xcite and to the formation of a vortex lattice @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now transpose this problem to the case of a two spin component fermi gas , initially at zero temperature and stirred by a rotating harmonic trapping potential of slowly increasing rotation speed , as described in section [ sec : model ] . </S>",
    "<S> does the hydrodynamic instability phenomenon occur also in the fermionic case , and does it lead to the entrance of vortices in the gas and to the subsequent formation of a vortex lattice ? </S>",
    "<S> we first address this problem analytically , in section [ sec : hydro ] , by solving exactly the time dependent two - dimensional hydrodynamic equations and by performing a linear stability analysis : very similarly to the bosonic case , we find that a dynamic instability can occur above some minimal rotation speed . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend this conclusion to the 3d unitary quantum gas . </S>",
    "<S> then we test this prediction by a numerical solution of the time dependent bcs equations on a two - dimensional lattice model , in section [ sec : simul ] : this confirms that the dynamic instability can take place and leads to the entrance of vortices in the gas , which are then seen to arrange in a regular pattern at long evolution times . </S>"
