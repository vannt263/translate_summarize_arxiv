    "it produces pulses of @xmath1 ps duration at the wavelength of @xmath58 nm , with @xmath1 mhz of repetition rate and about @xmath59 mw of average power .",
    "the laser output is split to provide the seed for the slr signal and the pump pulse for the qubits .",
    "the slr pulse is obtained by selecting with a pulse picker one pulse every @xmath8 and then using a regenerative amplifier and two single - pass amplifiers followed by a second harmonic generation ( shg ) stage , obtaining a pulse at @xmath60 nm with @xmath1 mj energy and @xmath0 hz repetition rate .",
    "the beam used to generate the qubits is obtained by sending the rest of the master oscillator laser to a suitable shg unit , whose output is @xmath61 mw .",
    "the beam divergence is controlled by a collimator and the polarization state is controlled by two waveplates and a modulator .",
    "two non - polarizing beam splitters ( npbs ) are used to combine slr with qubit combs in the upward beam that is directed via the coud path to the mlro telescope , from which it propagates toward the satellites .",
    "the beams received from the satellites by the mlro telescope propagate backward via the coud path and are split by the same two npbs also used in the uplink .",
    "the qubit receiver is composed by a focalizing lens , a rotating waveplate , an optical shutter and two single photon photomultipliers ( pmts ) placed at the outputs of a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) .",
    "the signals detected by the pmts are fed into a time tagger with @xmath62 ps resolution .",
    "a rotating waveplate , controlled by software , is used to change between two receiving bases , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the pulses generated by the transmitter , passing through the first npbs produce a scattering that elevates the background noise at the quantum receiver . to prevent this effect",
    ", we implemented a time division protocol by using two fast mechanical optical shutters .",
    "in the first half of the @xmath1 ms slot between two slr pulses , the transmitter shutter is opened in order to send the qubit pulses toward the satellite , while the reception shutter is closed to protect the receiver pmts . in the second half of the slot the transmitter shutter",
    "is closed , and , once the receiver shutter is fully open , the detection phase begin ( see  [ fig : si_time_schedule ] ) . by using this protocol",
    ", the effective transmission time during a slot can not be larger than the round trip time ( rtt ) ; however , since the shutters require about @xmath65 ms to fully open and @xmath66 ms to fully close , the effective period is further reduced by @xmath67 ms . considering that for a leo satellite the rtt varies between @xmath23 and @xmath68 ms",
    ", the effective duty cycle can varies between @xmath69 and @xmath70 % .",
    "moreover , the effective duty cycle varies also in a single satellite passage , approaching its minimum when the satellite reaches its maximum elevation .",
    "as said in the main text , in order to have an additional confirmation that the obtained values of @xmath2 are correct , the full radar equation has been used to extrapolate the transmitter gain , given by @xmath71.\\ ] ] in the previous equation @xmath72 is the divergence angle of the upgoing beam ( including the beam broadening due to turbulence ) , while @xmath57 is the pointing error .",
    "since the two parameters @xmath57 and @xmath72 can not be directly and separately measured , we obtained an estimate for @xmath55 by comparison the data obtained in different passages of the several leo satellites .",
    "as a consequence of the pointing error , the detection frequency of the @xmath1 mhz laser varies strongly with time , thus producing localized peaks of detection for few tens of seconds , followed by the absence of signal . because of this several periods of at least @xmath0 seconds , in which the detection frequency was significantly above the background , have been isolated and only the peak frequency within these periods has been taken into account .",
    "to best approximate of @xmath55 , we averaged the most stable data taken for ajisai , jason and starlette , thus obtaining an effective gain of @xmath56 .",
    "this value for @xmath55 has been used in the link budget equation to estimate the received photons frequency and then the fit has been compared with the collected data as shown in  [ fig : linkb ] .",
    "the polarization state generated on the optical table of the mlro observatory in subjected to a unitary transformation due to the coud path of the telescope .",
