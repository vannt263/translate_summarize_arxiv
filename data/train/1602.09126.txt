    "exploring the properties of the @xmath0 meson at finite baryon density is an interesting and important topic , both from a theoretical and experimental point of view @xcite .",
    "theoretically , works based on the qcd sum rule approach @xcite have established a linear relation between the in - medium mass shift of the @xmath0 meson and the ( scalar ) strangeness content of the nucleon : @xmath3 ( for recent work along this line , see @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have , however , not been able to realistically consider the width of the @xmath0 .",
    "calculations based on @xmath4 meson - baryon effective field theory using kaonic degrees of freedom predicted an increase of the @xmath0 meson width at normal nuclear matter density by about an order of magnitude compared to the vacuum width @xcite . from an experimental point of view , the study of a possible modification of the @xmath0 meson in nuclear matter has also attracted considerable interest , as a number of dedicated experiments intending to measure its in - medium width and its possible mass shift have either been carried out in recent years @xcite or will be performed in the near future at the j - parc facility @xcite . for the interpretation of the various experimental findings ,",
    "a thorough theoretical understanding of the @xmath0 meson spectral function at finite density is mandatory .",
    "this paper is a more detailed and extended follow - up of our earlier work @xcite .",
    "we focus on the lowest three moments of the @xmath0 meson spectral function in vacuum and nuclear matter . the operator product expansion and the finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) relate these moments directly to the qcd condensates of lowest mass dimension and their respective in - medium modifications .",
    "specifically , the @xmath5-th spectral moment is related to condensates with mass dimension @xmath6 .",
    "the advantage of first considering only the lowest two moments @xmath7 lies in the fact that only condensates of up to mass dimension four are needed as an input .",
    "these are the well - known gluon and chiral condensates .",
    "their behavior in nuclear matter is also relatively well understood , at least to leading ( linear ) order in the baryon density .",
    "further subleading twist-2 corrections that appear only at finite density can be related to moments of quark and gluon distributions in the nucleon .",
    "for the second @xmath8 moment of the @xmath0 meson spectral function , much less constrained structures show up in the operator product expansion ( ope ) . among those the four - quark condensates are most prominent .",
    "order - of - magnitude estimates for these four - quark condensates can be made using a factorization assumption , the quantitative reliability of which is however doubtful and will be examined in the present work .",
    "the strategy pursued in the present paper is briefly summarized as follows .",
    "first we construct the spectral function of the @xmath0 meson channel in the vacuum using an improved vector dominance model that takes into account the coupling of the @xmath0 meson to kaon pairs , introducing energy dependent self - energy terms in the @xmath0 propagator .",
    "this allows for an accurate description of the @xmath1 cross section in the region of the @xmath0 meson peak , measured by the babar collaboration @xcite . by computing the zeroth and first moment of this spectral function",
    ", its consistency with the fesr can be checked .",
    "this fesr is derived in qcd from an ope of the vector current involving strange quarks .",
    "next , this analysis is extended to nuclear matter where both the spectral function and qcd condensates are modified independently . to describe the in - medium @xmath0 meson spectrum , we take into account the self - energy corrections due to interactions of the decay kaons with nucleons in the surrounding medium . at leading order in the baryon density these corrections are described by the free forward @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering amplitudes for which we employ results derived from chiral @xmath4 effective field theory . for the @xmath10 channel",
    "this includes @xmath11 coupled channels and the non - perturbative generation of the @xmath12 resonance @xcite . on the other hand , the density dependence of the condensates that appear on the ope side of the fesr are , at leading order in @xmath13 , derived model - independently using the feynman - hellman theorem . with these ingredients , the consistency of the lowest two moments of our in - medium spectral functions with the fesr is again tested .",
    "for the first moment of the spectral function in nuclear matter , its relationship to the strangeness sigma term of the nucleon is of special interest in view of recent lattice qcd results .    in order to estimate systematic uncertainties of our approach we examine the possible dependence of our findings on the high - energy properties of the spectral function . here",
    "an issue is the modeling of the onset of the perturbative qcd continuum . in the standard fesr",
    "this onset is parametrized using a simple step - function .",
    "we generalize this crude description using a schematic ramp - function with a variable slope parameter and study its influence on the results both in vacuum and nuclear matter .",
    "furthermore , we study the second moments of our vacuum and in - medium spectral functions and discus constraints on the four - quark condensates appearing in the ope for the strange vector channel .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ vacuum ] presents our moment analysis of the vacuum @xmath0 meson spectral function including a discussion of the improved vector dominance model , the fit to the experimental @xmath1 data and the matching with fesr .",
    "section [ nuclmatter ] deals with the generalization of this approach to nuclear matter , first discussing the computation of the in - medium spectrum based on the @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering amplitudes and then repeating the spectral moment analysis of the previous section . section [ sigma ] presents an updated study of the relationship between the first moment of the in - medium @xmath0 spectrum and the strangeness sigma term of the nucleon . in section [ fourquark ]",
    "the four - quark condensate values extracted from the second moment of the spectral function are presented .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions follow in section [ conclusion ] .",

    "since only the charged kaons are detected in this reaction , the corresponding @xmath44 term of @xmath45 in the numerator of eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) has to be retained while intermediate charge exchange processes , @xmath46 , are included in the resummation of the @xmath24 loops . to describe the data at energy regions in the continuum above the @xmath0 meson peak for which the simple model of eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) is not sufficient",
    ", we add a second order polynomial in @xmath47 , for @xmath48 : @xmath49 with coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 fitted to the data .",

    "the resulting curve is shown in fig.[fig : vac.fit ] together with the experimental @xmath1 data .     in vacuum ,",
    "compared to the experimental data for @xmath56 , adapted from @xcite .",
    "the dashed [ solid ] curve shows the result when only eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) [ both eqs.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) and ( [ eq : continuum ] ) ] are used for the fit .",

    ", the averaged mass now experiences a modest downward shift by about @xmath112 , more than for the pure s - wave case .",
    "this difference is explained by both a small shift of the @xmath0 resonance peak in combination with the pronounced low - energy continuum in the spectral function , caused by the opening of kaon - hyperon channels in the presence of p - wave interactions ( see fig.[fig : vac ] ) .",
    "the broadening of the in - medium @xmath0 resonance is further increased significantly , reaching @xmath113 , an order of magnitude larger than the vacuum width ( @xmath114 ) .    the implicit assumption made in eq.([eq : phi.nucl ] ) is that the form , eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) , of the vacuum self - energy remains unchanged in the medium : a possible additional density dependence of the strange vector - current coupling to the @xmath0 meson channel is neglected . here",
    "we briefly examine the validity of this assumption by introducing an extra factor , @xmath115 , in eq.([eq : veccorr3 ] ) , incorporating such a possible density dependence to leading order in @xmath13 : @xmath116 performing the same sum rule analysis as before at normal nuclear matter density , it turns out that consistency of the spectral function with the fesr requires @xmath117 to be small .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : overall.factor ] , in which the solutions @xmath100 of the zeroth and first momentum sum rules are shown as a function of the parameter @xmath117 , both for only s - wave and s+p - wave @xmath10 interaction cases .",

    "the threshold parameter @xmath99 remains almost the same as in the vacuum ( see fig.[fig : ramp.1 ] ) , while additional p - wave contributions lead to a small but notable decrease of @xmath99 .",
    "the solutions from the zeroth and first moment sum rules turn out again to be consistent within uncertainties as long as @xmath120 gev@xmath121 .",
    "as pointed out previously , eq.([eq : finite.density.c4 ] ) establishes a linear relationship between the first moment of the in - medium @xmath0 meson spectral function and the strangeness sigma term of the nucleon . in simple terms : a possible shift of the @xmath0 mass in nuclear matter sets constraints on the scalar density of strange quarks in the nucleon . in practice , of course , the situation is more involved because of the substantial asymmetric in - medium broadening of the @xmath0 resonance and requires a more detailed assessment of the spectral distribution including the continuum .    returning to eq.([eq : finite.density.c4 ] ) together with eq.([eq : sm2 ] )",

    "first we point out that as long as @xmath169 or @xmath168 take values of order 1 and larger , the four - quark condensate term dominates over the other two terms of higher order in @xmath68 given in eq.([eq : operesult3 ] ) .",
    "these terms can thus be safely neglected for the purposes of this discussion .",
    "further terms that appear at dimension 6 in vacuum include the mixed condensate , @xmath171 , and gluonic condensate involving three gluon fields , @xmath172 . for the vector correlator ,",
    "the wilson coefficients of both these condensates are known to vanish at leading order in @xmath67 @xcite and are therefore suppressed . at finite density",
    "more condensates can emerge because of broken lorentz symmetry .",
    "these involve expectation values of twist-2 or twist-4 operators which can be constructed from both quark and gluon fields .",
    "the ope for the quark - operators was recently worked out in @xcite , the full result for the gluonic sector is however still missing ( see @xcite for a discussion of such operators in the context of quarkonium sum rules ) . in this work",
    ", we will ignore all those non - scalar operators of dimension 6 in order to get a rough idea on the value of @xmath168 at normal nuclear matter density . to reach a more quantitative conclusion ,",
    "a full analysis taking into account all potentially large operators will however be required .",
    "we leave this issue to be studied in future work .    returning to eqs.([eq : fourquark1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fourquark2 ] ) , we now combine our spectral function and the threshold parameters obtained from the zeroth and first moments with the fesr of eq.([eq : sm3 ] ) to extract possible constraints for @xmath169 and @xmath168 . for simplicity",
    "we use here only the sum rules derived from the step - function ansatz of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) .",
    "specifically , we rewrite eq.([eq : sm3 ] ) to obtain an explicit expression for @xmath169 , @xmath173 ,   \\label{eq : kappa0}\\ ] ] and for @xmath168 , @xmath174 .",

    "of the four - quark condensate defined in eq.([eq : fourquark1 ] ) , extracted from the second moment sum rule ( [ eq : sm3 ] ) , as a function of the scale @xmath175 delineating low - energy and pqcd regions .",
    "the vertical dashed lines show the bounds of @xmath176 , as obtained from the zeroth and first moment sum rules .",
    "the horizontal short - dashed line indicates @xmath177 , corresponding to the exact factorization hypothesis .",
    ", width=302 ]    the uncertainties of @xmath169 seen in this figure are related to cancellations that occur between the spectral function integral and the perturbative qcd term proportional to @xmath178 . combined with the errors attached to the strange quark condensate and to @xmath67 , the @xmath169 values are constrained within a relatively broad window as indicated in fig.[fig : four.quark ] .",
    "one observes a strong dependence on the scale parameter @xmath175 . a typical value , @xmath179 gev , gives @xmath180 despite considerable uncertainties , one concludes at least qualitatively from this result that factorization based on vacuum dominance @xmath181 is not expected to be a good approximation .    to study the behavior of the four - quark condensates at finite density the analysis is repeated using eqs.([eq : fourquark2],[eq : kappan ] ) and the modified spectral functions of fig.[fig : vac ] .",
    "the respective results are given in fig.[fig : kappa.matter ] .    , but for @xmath168 at normal nuclear matter density @xmath182 .",
    "in the left ( right ) plot , s - wave ( s- and p - wave ) @xmath10 interactions are included.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] , but for @xmath168 at normal nuclear matter density @xmath182 .",
    "in the left ( right ) plot , s - wave ( s- and p - wave ) @xmath10 interactions are included.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    for the s - wave case , the situation does not deviate much from the vacuum , the range for @xmath168 at normal nuclear matter density being again @xmath183 for @xmath179 gev . as expected from the findings of the previous section , p - wave interactions have a somewhat stronger effect , leading to an overall moderate decrease of the allowed values of @xmath184 at @xmath185 gev : @xmath186 even though these constraints are not very restrictive , they nevertheless indicate clearly that the factorization hypothesis is expected to be strongly violated in nuclear matter , similar to what has been seen in the vacuum case .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to observe that the density dependence of @xmath167 appears to be rather weak .",
    "this is an issue that deserves a more detailed investigation , for instance by explicitly taking into account the intermediate single and multiple kaon states between the two - quark operators .",
    "we plan to tackle this problem in future work .",
    "in this work we have studied the modifications of the @xmath0 meson spectral function in nuclear matter based on an effective field theory approach employing up - to - date @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions .",
    "the resulting spectra were then used to compute their zeroth and first moments , that are related to qcd parameters and condensates of mass dimension 2 and 4 via the finite energy sum rules ( fesr ) .    as a basis for our analysis at finite density ,",
    "we have first constructed a spectral function for the @xmath0 meson in vacuum , based on a vector dominance model improved through the inclusion of kaon loops that couple to the bare @xmath0 meson . as seen in fig.[fig : vac.fit ] , this allows for an excellent description of recent experimental @xmath1 cross section data @xcite in the region of the @xmath0 resonance . to apply this spectrum to the analysis of moments , one however needs to model the onset of the continuum , which should approach the perturbative qcd limit at high energy . for this purpose ,",
    "we have tested two different ans@xmath187tze : the step function of eq.([eq : ansatz ] ) and the schematic ramp function of eqs.([eq : ansatz.ramp],[eq : ansatz.ramp2 ] ) , motivated by the behavior of the channels involving one and two pions in addition to @xmath188 and shown in fig.[fig : vac.fit.2 ] .",
    "combining these functional forms with the @xmath0 meson spectrum at low energy , our fesr analysis shows almost perfect consistency within errors for the characteristic scales that delineate the low and high energy ranges of the zeroth and first moment sum rules .    using this well constrained vacuum spectral function as a starting point",
    ", we next examined the effects of finite density . assuming that the nucleons of the surrounding medium affect the @xmath0 meson primarily through interactions with kaons , density effects were taken into account by modifying the kaon propagators that enter into the kaon loops of the @xmath0 meson self - energy .",
    "to leading order in density , the modifications are determined by the free @xmath9 and @xmath10 scattering amplitudes . to this end , we first employed s - wave @xmath9 and @xmath10 amplitudes derived from chiral @xmath4 effective field theory , which are repulsive for the @xmath9 and attractive and strongly energy dependent for the @xmath10 case .",
    "the latter property is related to the formation of the @xmath12 resonance in that channel .",
    "while for @xmath9 it suffices to approximate the amplitude by a purely real constant , a more elaborate treatment is needed for @xmath10 , for which we made use of a realistic coupled - channel approach based on a chiral @xmath4 effective lagrangian . at normal nuclear matter density @xmath182 ,",
    "all this leads to a rather strong broadening of the @xmath0 meson peak ( @xmath108 ) and only a small overall shift of its peak position . including furthermore p - wave @xmath9 and @xmath10 interactions involving @xmath189-hyperon intermediate states into the analysis , causes the broadening to increase further ( @xmath190 ) and induces to a downward shift of the resonance maximum .",
    "computing the first and zeroth moments of the finite density spectrum , the level of agreement among the fesr s can again be tested . while the sum rule for the zeroth moment [ eqs.([eq : sm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sm1.ramp ] ) ] remains unaffected by finite density effects , the one for the first moment [ eqs.([eq : sm2 ] ) and ( [ eq : sm2.ramp ] ) ] receives corrections due to the modifications of scalar condensates and the emergence of new non - scalar condensates .",
    "the consistency of the two sum rules however turns out to be just as good as for the vacuum , unless the slope parameter of the  ramp \" function interpolating between low- and high - energy regimes becomes unphysically small .",
    "a special feature of the in - medium @xmath0 meson spectral function is the strong sensitivity of its first moment with respect to @xmath95 , the strangeness sigma term of the nucleon , i.e. the degree to which the scalar density of strange quarks contributes to the nucleon ground state . at leading order in density",
    ", a linear relationship emerges between this sigma term and the in - medium shift of the first spectral moment ( with the perturbative qcd limit subtracted ) .",
    "a measurement of this in - medium spectral moment of the @xmath0 would therefore add an empirical constraint to the ongoing discussion about @xmath95 , recently promoted by several lattice qcd computations .",
    "given the spectral function for both the vacuum and nuclear matter , it is possible to compute still higher moments and to study the respective sum rules .",
    "here we have focused on the second moment . through eqs.([eq : sm3 ] ) and ( [ eq : sm3.ramp ] ) it is related to condensates of mass dimension 6 , with the dominant contribution coming from four - quark condensates involving one or two strange quark - antiquark pairs . this sum rule can therefore be used to derive constraints on the values of these four - quark condensates .",
    "it is found that the frequently employed factorization hypothesis , assuming ground state dominance , is likely to be strongly violated both in vacuum and nuclear matter .",
    "comparing our findings with those of earlier works , it is seen that our spectral functions have qualitatively similar features as those of previous studies @xcite , namely relatively strong broadening and only a small negative mass shift of the @xmath0 meson peak . on the other hand ,",
    "the sum rule input has changed significantly compared to @xcite because of the possibility of much smaller @xmath95 values , which lead to reduced mass shift predictions .    as a last point ,",
    "let us discuss implications of the present study for future measurements of the in - medium @xmath0 meson spectral function , in particular with reference to the e16 experiment planned at j - parc @xcite . in the present work the @xmath0 meson was considered to be at rest with respect to the surrounding medium .",
    "a direct comparison with experimental spectra corresponding to a @xmath0 in motion should therefore be made with caution .",
    "earlier studies have already examined this issue @xcite to some extent , but more work is needed to fully understand the finite momentum effects .",
    "there are nevertheless a number of general conclusions that can be drawn from the present work .",
    "the in - medium spectra shown in fig.[fig : vac ] exhibit a characteristically non - symmetric behavior around the @xmath0 resonance , with an enhancement of strength in the low - energy sub - resonance region caused by strong broadening and the opening of new decay channels .",
    "the possibility of such behavior should be taken into consideration in future analyses of experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we stress again the usefulness of the two lowest spectral moments as they provide direct relations to the most relevant low - dimensional qcd condensates and their changes at finite density .",
    "high precision measurements of these and higher moments in nuclei would provide strong constraints for the behavior of various combinations of gluon and quark condensates in nuclear matter .",
    "this work is partially supported by bmbf grant 05p12woctb and by dfg through crc 110  symmetries and emergence of structure in qcd \" .",
    "the authors would like to thank yoichi ikeda for providing them with his code for computing the @xmath10 scattering amplitudes .",
