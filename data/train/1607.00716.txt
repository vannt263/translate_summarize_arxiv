    "therefore , when solving the geanogjbd problem with the procedure in subsection  [ subsec : solvenogjbd ] , it is critical to choose a `` proper '' @xmath287 for the approximate null space @xmath303 and a `` good '' @xmath289 in the sense that the eigenvalues of @xmath6 has as many clusters as possible and the gap between different clusters is as large as possible .    how to choose a `` proper '' @xmath287 can be very tricky",

    "+     it can be seen from figure  [ fig : signal ] that when snr is more than 50 , the recovered signals obtained from all six algorithms are at the same level of quality , and when snr is smaller than 40 , our algorithms give much better result .",
    "in this paper , we show that the solution to the geenogjbd problem or the geanogjbd problem can be obtained by finding a proper @xmath6 in @xmath68 or @xmath292 followed by computing an eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath6 . a necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence of all solutions to the geenogjbd problem",
    "is established .",
    "based on the established theory , two algorithms are proposed to solve the geanogjbd problem .",
    "the first algorithm , which uses a greedy strategy , is simple and efficient , but may suffer from instability . the second algorithm , which uses a conservative strategy ,",

    "our limited numerical experiments show that the geanogjbd - consv method outperforms the current iterative algorithms based on optimization , especially when the snr is small .",
    "finally , it worth mentioning here that the necessary and sufficient condition for the equivalence of all solutions to the geenogjbd problem can be used to analyze the sensitivity of the geenojbd problem , and we will present the results in a separate paper .",
    "the approach we treat the geenogjbd / geanogjbd problem in this paper can also be used to deal with the geenugjbd / geanugjbd problem , and some third order tensor decompositions , too .",
