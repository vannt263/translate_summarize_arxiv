    "macroscopic properties of granular materials such as soils depend on particle interactions . in dry granular materials , interparticle forces",
    "are related to the applied external loads as different studies have shown @xcite . in unsaturated soils subjected to capillary effects , new features must be accounted for in order to understand properly their behaviour .",
    "the presence of water leads to the formation of water menisci between neighboring grains , introducing new interparticle forces .",
    "the effects of these forces depend on the degree of saturation of the medium . for low water content level corresponding to disconnected liquid bridges between grains ,",
    "capillary theory allows the force induced by those bridges to be linked to the local geometry of the grains and to the matric suction or capillary pressure inside the medium @xcite .",
    "since the disconnected menisci assumption is not valid for high water content levels due to water percolation , we consider here only the unsaturated state where the discontinuity of the water phase can be assumed , the so - called pendular regime .",
    "+ there has been a wide debate on the various interpretations for the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils . at early stages of soil mechanics ,",
    "terzaghi @xcite first introduced the concept of effective stress for the particular case of saturated soils enabling the conversion of a multiphase porous medium into a mechanically equivalent single - phase continuum . in unsaturated soils ,",
    "water induced stresses are still debated .",
    "the common practice @xcite is to use the suction or a modified version as a second stress variable within a complete hydro - mechanical framework .",
    "an alternative method is introduced to develop homogenisation techniques in order to derive stress - strain relationships from forces and displacements at the particle level as proposed in @xcite for dry granular materials .",
    "the basic idea is to consider the material as represented by a set of micro - systems , postulating that the behaviour of a material volume element depends on the intergranular interactions belonging to this volume .",
    "we propose here to extend this micro - mechanical approach to unsaturated granular materials as proposed by li @xcite , jiang et al .",
    "@xcite or lu and likos @xcite .",
    "+ along these lines we present two micromechanical models which take into account capillary forces .",
    "the first one is a three dimensional numerical model based on the discrete element method ( hereafter designed as the dem model ) pioneered by cundall and strack @xcite , and the second one is an analytical model ( hereafter designed as the microstructural model ) recently proposed by hicher and chang @xcite .",
    "the microstructural model is a stress - strain relation which considers interparticle forces and displacements .",
    "thanks to analytical homogenisation / localisation techniques , the macroscopic relation between stress and strain can be derived .    in the dem model , a granular medium",
    "is modelled by a set of grains interacting according to elementary laws .",
    "direct simulations are carried out on grain assemblies , computing the response of the material along a given loading path .    by studying their effects under triaxial loading",
    ", we investigate capillary forces implications at the macroscopic level , and offer an insight into the unsaturated soil stress framework by introducing a capillary stress tensor as a result of homogenization techniques .",
    "macroscopic interpretations of the mechanical behaviour of unsaturated soils have been mainly developed in the framework of elastoplasticity @xcite .",
    "most of these models consider that the strain tensor is governed by the net stress tensor @xmath0 ( @xmath1 being the pore air pressure ) and the matric suction or capillary pressure @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being the pore water pressure ) inside the medium @xcite . in particular , they consider a new yield surface , called loading collapse ( lc ) surface in the plane ( ( @xmath0),(@xmath2 ) ) which controls the volume changes due to the evolution of the degree of saturation for a given loading path . as a matter of fact , all these formulations can be considered as extensions of the relationship initially proposed by bishop and blight @xcite for unsaturated soils : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is called the effective stress parameter or bishop s parameter , and is a function of the degree of saturation @xmath6 of the medium ( @xmath7 for a dry material , @xmath8 for a fully saturated material ) .",
    "+ obviously , since the effective stress principle is by definition a macroscopic concept , several authors ( lu and likos @xcite or li @xcite ) have proposed to use a micromechanical approach for the effective stress principle . in order to further study this micromechanical approach to study unsaturated soil",
    "stresses , we propose here a micromechanical analysis of the problem , examining the local water induced effects through a set of simulated laboratory experiments .",
    "let us consider a representative volume element ( rve ) of a wet granular material , subjected to an assigned external loading .",
    "when the water content decreases inside a saturated granular sample , the air breaks through at a given state . the capillary pressure ( @xmath2 ) corresponding to that point",
    "is called the air - entry pressure , and strongly depends on the pore sizes .",
    "thereafter , the sample becomes unsaturated and capillary forces start to grow due to interface actions between air and water .",
    "since the the gaseous phase is discontinue , this is the capillary regime . from this state , a constant decrease in the degree of saturation corresponds to a gentle increase in pore water pressure .",
    "the pendular regime starts when the water phase is no longer continuous . in this state ,",
    "fluids equilibrium is obtained by the vapor pressure .",
    "analytical and experimental results @xcite demonstrate that capillary effects at particle contacts produces a kind of bond between particles as a result of menisci ( fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "liquid bridges may form between some pairs of adjoining particles not necessarily in contact , generating an attractive capillary force between the bonded particles .",
    "if the drying process continues , these water bridges begin to fail , starting from the non - contacting grains , until the complete disappearance of capillary forces inside the assembly . + as the pendular regime is considered throughout this paper , water is considered to be solely composed of capillary menisci : each liquid bridge is assumed to connect only two particles .",
    "therefore , two types of forces coexist within the granular medium . for dry contacts",
    ", a contact force develops between contacting granules .",
    "this repulsive force , that is a function of the relative motion between the contacting grains , is usually well described by an elastoplastic contact model . for water bonded particles , a specific attractive force exists .",
    "this water - induced attractive interaction can be described by a resulting capillary force , rather than by a stress distribution as mentionned by haines @xcite or fisher @xcite .",
    "this capillary force is a function of the bridge volume , of the size of particles , and of the fluid nature ( see section 3.1.1 for the details ) .",
    "the objective of this section is to derive , in a simple manner , an expression relating the overall stress tensor within the rve to this internal force distribution .",
    "+ for this purpose , the love @xcite static homogenisation relation is used .",
    "this relation expresses the mean stress tensor @xmath9 within a granular volume @xmath10 as a function of the external forces @xmath11 applied to the particles @xmath12 belonging to the boundary @xmath13 of the volume : @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the coordinates of the particle @xmath12 with respect to a suitable frame .",
    "it is worth noting that this relation is valid whatever the nature of the interactions between grains .",
    "+ taking into account the mechanical balance of each particle of the volume @xmath10 ( including the boundary @xmath13 ) , eq.(2 ) can be written as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of particles within the volume , @xmath18 is the interaction force exerted by the particle @xmath19 onto the particle @xmath12 , and @xmath20 is the branch vector pointing from particle @xmath19 to particle @xmath12 ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "+ as we consider partially saturated granular media , two independent kinds of interparticle forces can be distinguished :    1 .   if particles @xmath12 and @xmath19 are in contact , a contact force @xmath22 exists",
    "2 .   if particles @xmath12 and @xmath19 are bonded by a liquid bridge , a capillary force @xmath23 exists .    actually ,",
    "depending on the local geometry , a liquid bond can exist between two grains in contact . in that case ,",
    "solid contacts are surrounded by the continuous liquid phase providing the simultaneity of contact and capillary forces .",
    "the two contributions have therefore to be accounted for by summation .",
    "+ finally , in all cases and for any couple @xmath24 ^ 2 $ ] , it can be written that : @xmath25 thus , by combining eqs.(2 ) and ( 4 ) , it follows that : @xmath26    as a consequence , eq.(5 ) indicates that the stress tensor is split into two components : @xmath27    1 .   a first component @xmath28 accounting for the contact forces transmitted along the contact network .",
    "2 .   a second component @xmath29 representing the capillary forces existing within the assembly .    it is to be noted that @xmath30 is a stress quantity standing for intergranular contact forces in the same way as in saturated or dry conditions . considering the concept as initially introduced by terzaghi",
    ", @xmath30 plays the role of the so - called effective stress by governing soil deformation and failure . besides , @xmath31 is the tensorial attribute to capillary water effects or suction , by extension .",
    "by analogy with eq.(1 ) , we can therefore define a microstructural effective stress @xmath32 where @xmath33 could be affiliated to net stress , representing the apparent stress state in the material .",
    "compared with eq.(1 ) , where the effect of water is intrinsically isotropic , @xmath31 implies a tensorial attribute to the water effects .",
    "+ in fact , in both terms @xmath30 and @xmath31 , a fabric tensor can emerge from the summation @xcite .",
    "the fabric tensor is useful to characterize the contact anisotropy of the assembly , which is known as a basic feature of granular assemblies . in dry granular materials ,",
    "an induced anisotropy can develop when a deviatoric stress loading is applied . in partially saturated assembly , due to the possibility of interactions without contact ,",
    "the conclusion is not so trivial . as an illustration ,",
    "if we restrict our analysis to spherical particles @xcite , it can be inferred that : @xmath34 this relation points out that , contrary to the contact term where the fabric tensor @xmath35 is directly linked to the induced anisotropy ( a contact is associated with a force ) , two causes can be invoked for the capillary term .",
    "first , the distribution of the liquid bonds can be anisotropic .",
    "secondly , the geometry of the bonds being obviously dependent on the local geometry , it is possible that the distribution of both terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 is also anisotropic .",
    "this is significant because the anisotropic attribute yields shear effects associated with pore fluid , which could mostly influence material behaviour . + in order to enrich our discussion , we present numerical investigations of these features in the following sections using both dem and micromechanical simulations .",
    "we present here a numerical analysis of the stress variables using a micromechanical model based upon the discrete element method initially introduced by cundall and strack @xcite .",
    "this technique starts with basic constitutive laws between interacting particles and can provide a macroscopic response of a particle assembly due to loading changes at the boundaries .",
    "each particle of the material is a rigid sphere identified by its own mass , @xmath38 , radius , @xmath39 and moment of inertia , @xmath40 . for every time step of the computation , interaction forces between particles , and consequently resulting forces acting on each of them ,",
    "are deduced from sphere positions through the interaction law .",
    "newton s second law is then integrated through an explicit second order finite difference scheme to compute the new sphere positions .",
    "a 3d software called yade ( yet another dynamic engine ) , kozicki and donz @xcite , has been enhanced in order to properly simulate partially saturated granular material features .",
    "the contact interaction is described by an elastic - plastic relation between the force @xmath41 and the relative displacement @xmath42 of two interacting particles .",
    "a normal stiffness @xmath43 is therefore defined to relate the normal force @xmath44 to the intergranular normal relative displacement @xmath45 : @xmath46 and a tangential stiffness @xmath47 allows us to deduce the shear force @xmath48 induced by the incremental tangential relative displacement @xmath49 ; this tangential behaviour obeying the coulomb friction law : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the coulomb friction coefficient defined as @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the intergranular friction angle . + in the work presented here ,",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath47 are dependent functions of the interacting particle sizes and of a characteristic modulus of the material denoted as @xmath54 : @xmath55 this definition results in a constant ratio between @xmath54 and the effective bulk modulus of the packing , whatever the size of the particles . + for simplicity , we assume that the water inside the sample is solely composed of capillary water as defined in the pendular state , with a discontinuous liquid phase .        much attention has been given to these pendular liquid bridges , @xcite .",
    "their exact shape between spherical bodies is defined by the laplace equation , relating the pressure difference @xmath56 across the liquid - gas interface to the mean curvature of the bridge and the surface tension of the liquid phase @xmath57 : @xmath58    in the cartesian coordinates of fig.[fig1](b ) the two curvature radii @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( fig.[fig1](a ) ) , are given by : @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 defines the profile of the liquid - gas interface curve .",
    "the @xmath64 axis coincides with the axis of symmetry of the bridge , passing through the centers of the connected spheres ( fig.[fig1](b ) ) .",
    "according to the laplace equation , the profile of the liquid bridge is thus related to the capillary pressure @xmath65 through the following differential equation : @xmath66 the corresponding liquid bridge volume @xmath10 and intergranular distance @xmath67 can be obtained by considering the @xmath64-coordinates ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) of the three - phases contact lines defining the solid - liquid - gas interface , as defined by souli et al.,@xcite : @xmath70 and @xmath71    the capillary force due to the liquid bridge can be calculated at the profile apex @xmath72 according to the ` gorge method ' @xcite and consists of a contribution of the capillary pressure @xmath65 as well as the surface tension @xmath57 : @xmath73    the relation between the capillary pressure and the configuration of the capillary doublet is thus described by a system of non - linear coupled equations ( 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ) where the local geometry ( @xmath67 ) and water volume arise as a result of the solved system @xcite .",
    "so , to account for capillarity in the code , an interpolation scheme on a set of discrete solutions of the laplace equation has been developed in order to link directly the capillary pressure to the capillary force and water volume of the liquid bridge for a given grain - pair configuration .",
    "this results in a suction - controlled model where , at every time - step during the simulation , capillary forces and water volumes ( @xmath74 ) are computed based upon the microstructure geometry @xmath67 and the imposed suction level @xmath65",
    ". @xmath75 a schematic diagram of the implemented capillary law is shown in fig.[fig2 ] for a given value of the suction .     with the intergranular distance @xmath67 for a given suction value : a meniscus can form for @xmath76 and breaks off for @xmath77.,width=283 ]    in this paper , the choice was made to define the appearance of a bridge when particles come strictly in contact ( @xmath78 ) , neglecting the possibility of adsorbed water effects .",
    "the capillary force is considered constant for the range of the elastic deformation ( @xmath79 ) , assuming local displacements to be very small compared to particle radii .",
    "let us note that the formulation intrinsically defines the distance from which the meniscus breaks off as depending on the given capillary pressure and on the local geometry .",
    "this maximum distance @xmath80 corresponds to the minimum @xmath67 value from which the laplace equation has no solution .",
    "since this study covers the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of unsaturated granular media , stress tensors are calculated by both macro and micro - methods .",
    "the macro - method is the conventional way used in laboratory to measure stresses in experiments , that is to say : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the normal force acting on the boundary , and @xmath83 the surface of the boundary oriented by the normal direction @xmath84 .",
    "this stress is equivalent to net stress @xmath85 used in unsaturated soils mechanics , with @xmath1 used as the reference pressure because the pore air pressure is effectively zero in many practical problems ( as well as in this study ) . +",
    "as seen in section 2.2 , two other stress tensors can be considered through homogenization techniques : the intergranular stress tensor @xmath86 computed from intergranular forces , and the capillary stress tensor @xmath31 computed from capillary forces .",
    "the studied particle assembly is a 1 mm length cubic sample composed of 10000 spheres , with a grain size distribution ranging from 0.025 mm to 0.08 mm , as shown in fig.[fig3 ] , and a porosity of 0.385 .",
    "the input parameters are listed in table 1 , referring to equation ( 10 ) .",
    ".dem model parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + fig.[fig11 ] presents the numerical simulations of three triaxial tests performed at three different confining pressures of @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for the simulated dry assembly having an initial void ratio equal to @xmath90 .",
    "one can see that the results obtained with the microstructural model compared well to dem ones .",
    "dem simulations were performed on unsaturated assemblies with an initial saturation degree of about @xmath91 , corresponding to a suction value equal to @xmath92 . in order to determine the corresponding capillary forces ,",
    "eq.(25 ) includes two material parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 which control the evolution of the water induced forces with the distance between two particles . according to experimental results presented in different studies @xcite",
    ", we decided to take a value of @xmath95 and of @xmath96 .",
    "these values give a standard evolution for the capillary forces , function of the distance between particles , as well as an initial isotropic distribution of these forces if the material structure is isotropic .",
    "the evolution of the capillary forces with the degree of saturation requires two more parameters : @xmath97 and @xmath98 . according to previous studies",
    "@xcite , we selected a value of @xmath99 and determined the value of @xmath100 . in order to obtain an initial value of the capillary stress in accordance with the one computed by dem .",
    "we then performed numerical simulations of triaxial tests on wet samples for different confining pressures .",
    "contrary to dem suction - controlled simulations , the microstructural model tests are water content controlled . in order to compare those two approaches",
    ", samples were initially wetted at a common degree of saturation of about @xmath91 .",
    "one should notice that , even if the test conditions are not strictly identical , the changes in the degree of saturation during loading obtained for both tests are sufficiently similar for us ( fig.[fig12 ] ) to compare the results obtained by the two approaches .",
    "+ as presented in fig.[fig13 ] , the two models give quite similar results .",
    "one can see that a material strength increase is obtained for unsaturated samples compared to dry ones at the same confining pressure .",
    "the volume changes during triaxial loading create a small change in the degree of saturation ( fig.[fig12 ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the capillary forces evolve , according to eq.(5 ) .",
    "fig.[fig14 ] shows the evolution of the principal components of the capillary stress tensor during constant water content triaxial tests .",
    "the initial state corresponds to an isotropic capillary stress tensor with a mean stress equal to @xmath101 as obtained in dem . during loading",
    ", a structural anisotropy is created due to the evolution of the fabric tensor defined in eq.(38 ) .",
    "therefore , the principal components of the capillary stress tensor evolve differently .",
    "in the studied cases , this difference remains small and corresponds at the end of the test to a relative difference less than @xmath102 .",
    "this small difference can be explained by two causes .",
    "the first one is the small amount of induced anisotropy obtained by the evolution of the fabric tensor .",
    "this evolution is due to the change in the branch length @xmath103 for each @xmath104 direction which , in this version of the model , is only due to elastic deformations of the grains in contact .",
    "since all our numerical testing were performed at small confining stresses , the amount of elastic deformation remained quite small .",
    "the second reason is linked to the fact that the capillary bridges can exist for non - touching neighboring grains .",
    "this has been taken into account in calculating the mean capillary force and also in determining the capillary stress tensor ( eqs.(27 ) and ( 41 ) ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with the distribution of the contacts and menisci distribution computed by dem ( figs.[fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "+ regarding the constitutive behaviour at contacts between solid particles , the results provided by the two methods are in rather good agreement concerning the influence of capillary forces at a macroscopic level .",
    "the increase in the shear strength classically observed for partially saturated materials is clearly encountered starting from microscopical considerations , and the slight induced anisotropy of the capillary stress tensor is observed , confirming that suction effects in unsaturated materials can not be precisely accounted for by an equivalent pore pressure assumption .",
    "starting from local capillary forces , a stress variable , denoted as the capillary stress tensor and intrinsically associated to water effects , has been defined through homogenisation techniques .",
    "triaxial compression test simulations from two fundamentally different micromechanical models were performed on a granular assembly under several confining pressures for dry and partially saturated conditions .",
    "both models reproduce in quite good agreement the main features of unsaturated granular materials , in particular the increase of the shear strength due to capillary effects .",
    "+ the results also suggest that , in partially saturated materials within the pendular regime , the effects of pore fluid are adequately represented by a discrete distribution of forces rather than by an averaged pressure in the fluid phase .",
    "effectively , as a representative quantity of the pore fluid distribution inside unsaturated materials , this suction associated stress tensor reveals that pore fluid has its own fabric which is inherently anisotropic and strongly dependent on the combined loading and hydric history of the material .",
    "even if the induced anisotropy of the capillary stress tensor appears slight in this study , it is obvious that this tensorial nature of water in unsaturated material implies suction to produce shear effects on the solid phase .",
    "this suction induced shear effect consequently makes it difficult to associate an isotropic quantity to water as expressed in the bishop s effective stress .",
    "pore pressure is no longer an isotropic stress in unsaturated soil , and therefore , can not be considered as an equivalent continuum medium .",
    "the analysis finally confirms that suction is a pore - scale concept , and that stress definitions for unsaturated soils should also include microscopic interparticle stresses as the ones resulting from capillary forces .",
    "+ the multi - scale approach presented here appears to be a pertinent complementary tool for the study of unsaturated soil mechanics .",
    "more precisely , discrete methods should convey new insights into the discussion about the controversial concept of generalized effective stress by relating basic physical aspects to classical phenomenological views .",
