    "the last term is the spin - orbit coupling , which ( restoring the factor @xmath198 ) is of strength @xmath207 .",
    "summarizing , the nonrelativistic limit of the 2d dirac oscillator is the circular harmonic oscillator with a strong spin - orbit coupling term with all levels shifted by the factor @xmath61 .",
    "indeed , the shifted energy levels are @xmath208 as for the relativistic case , for @xmath136 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) the energy eigenvalues are independent of the quantum number @xmath133 .",

    "<S> it is shown that earlier approaches to this problem have neglected a @xmath0 function contribution to the full hamiltonian , which comes from the zeeman interaction . </S>",
