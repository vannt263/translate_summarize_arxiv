    "recently , the atic and ppb - bets balloon experiments have observed excess in the @xmath6 energy spectrum between 300 and 800 gev @xcite . the pamela collaboration has also reported excesses in the positron fraction from 10 to @xmath7 gev , but shown no excess for the antiproton data @xcite compared with the prediction in the cosmic ray physics .",
    "these results are compatible with the previous heat and ams01 experiments ( e.g. , @xcite ) with higher precision .",
    "newly published result from fermi also shows an excess at the @xmath6 energy spectrum above the background of the conventional cosmic ray model .",
    "however , it shows a softer spectrum than atic @xcite .",
    "the excesses may be explained by astrophysical processes , for instance the nearby pulsars @xcite or photon - cosmic ray interactions @xcite , or due to annihilation or decay of dark matter ( dm ) particles in our galactic neighbourhood predominately into leptons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar explanation can also account for the excess observed at fermi by assuming a softer injection electron spectrum from these sources @xcite .",
    "pamela indicate that the dark matter is hadrophobic or leptophilic@xcite . in this work",
    "we show that gauged @xmath8 models proposed some time ago@xcite in searching for simple @xmath5 can naturally explain the excess in electron / positron spectrum through the dm annihilation mechanism . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are one of the three family lepton numbers with @xmath11 .",
    "in constructing dark matter models , one should note that although atic or fermi data is consistent with pamela data separately , atic and fermi data do not agree with each other .",
    "improved data are needed to decide which ones are correct and to distinguish different dark matter models . in the models we are considering ,",
    "there are three different ways to gauge the lepton number differences : a ) @xmath2 , b ) @xmath3 , and c ) @xmath4 .",
    "each of them has different features .",
    "our aim in this work is to identify which of the three models can explain which data set better .",
    "the @xmath5 in the gauged @xmath0 is leptophilic which only interacts with standard model ( sm ) leptons .",
    "if the @xmath5 also interacts with dm@xcite , it will be the main mediator for dm annihilation with final product dominated by leptons offering possible explanation to electron / positron excess without anti - proton excess at pamela data .",
    "another requirement for dm annihilation to account for the positron excess is that the annihilation rate @xmath12 determining the electron / positron spectrum should be much larger than that determined from the usual thermal dm relic density .",
    "the enhancement factor , usually referred as the boost factor , is in the range of @xmath13 .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to produce a large boost factor , including the dm substructures , dm nonthermal production mechanism @xcite , the sommerfeld effect @xcite and the breit - wigner resonance enhancement effect @xcite .",
    "the detailed calculation based on the n - body simulation shows that the boost factor from dm substructures is generally less than @xmath14 @xcite . in order for the sommerfeld effect to be effective ,",
    "the mediating particle needs to be very light to allow long range interaction between dm particles .",
    "this mechanism in our case will result in a light @xmath5 boson . however , there are very tight constraints on the coupling constant for such light @xmath5 .",
    "instead the breit - wigner resonance enhancement mechanism works very well in our model if the @xmath5 mass is about two times of the dark matter mass . from the relic density and atic , fermi and pamela data we can also constrain the @xmath0 charge of dm .",
    "there is no need to have very different @xmath0 charges of dm and sm leptons as in @xcite .",
    "further , the determined @xmath0 gauge coupling strength is consistent with all constraints from lep , @xmath15 and other data .",
    "the atic data also show a sharp falling at about @xmath16 gev in the electron / positron energy spectrum .",
    "we find such a feature needs substantial electron component as the dm annihilation products with the electron and positron pairs have a fixed energy from dm annihilation .",
    "additional electron / positron energy spectrum with lower energy from secondary decays will then help to enhance positron with lower energies .",
    "we find that the gauged @xmath17 ( model a ) ) and @xmath18 ( model b ) ) can give excellent fit to the atic data while the @xmath19 can not . on the contrary",
    ", fermi shows a much softer electron spectrum , which does not favor the initial electron component .",
    "we find that the gauged @xmath19 ( model c ) ) gives an excellent fit to the fermi , pamela and hess data .",
    "the paper is organized as following : in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief introduction of the model . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the breit - wigner mechanism and the numerical results of relic density and boost factor in our model .",
    "then we show the electron / positron spectrum of our model in sec .",
    "finally we give discussions and conclusions in sec . v.",
    "one of the following global symmetries in the sm can be gauged without gauge anomalies@xcite @xmath20 the gauge boson @xmath5 resulting from one of the above models has the desired leptophilic couplings . at the tree - level",
    "the @xmath5 only couples to one of the pairs @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath21 and @xmath23 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we will use @xmath24 to indicate the quantum numbers for one of the above three possibilities , @xmath25 . if the @xmath5 in one of these models is the messenger mediating dark matter annihilation , the resulting final states are mainly leptonic states which can lead to electron / positron excess observed in cosmic rays .",
    "it is then desirable to have the @xmath5 to couple to dark matter@xcite .",
    "we therefore introduce a new vector - like fermion @xmath26 with a non - trivial @xmath24 number @xmath27 .",
    "the reason for the dark matter being vector - like is to make sure that the theory does not have gauge anomaly required for self consistency .",
    "the @xmath5 boson can develop a finite mass from spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking of a scalar @xmath28 with a non - trivial charge @xmath29 . with the new particles @xmath5 , @xmath28 and @xmath26 in the model , addition term @xmath30 have to be added to the lagrangian beside the sm one @xmath31 with @xmath32\\psi \\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( d_\\mu s)^\\dagger ( d^\\mu s ) + \\mu^2_s s^\\dagger s + \\lambda_s ( s^\\dagger s)^2 + \\lambda_{sh } ( s^\\dagger s ) h^\\dagger h\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is summed over the sm leptons .",
    "@xmath34 is the usual sm higgs doublet .    the @xmath5 coupling to fermions are given by @xmath35 note that the @xmath5 coupling to leptons are flavor diagonal .",
    "there is no tree level flavor changing neutral current induced by @xmath5 .",
    "after @xmath28 and @xmath34 develop non - vanishing vacuum expectation values ( vev ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the physical components from @xmath28 and @xmath34 can be written as @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "the non - zero @xmath36 will induce a non - zero @xmath5 mass given by : @xmath40 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath36 together with the non - zero @xmath37 will induce mixing between @xmath41 and @xmath42 with the mixing parameter proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "this mixing will change the masses @xmath44 and @xmath45 of @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the limit of without mixing .",
    "since we will require @xmath46 to be much larger than the @xmath47 mass , this implies that @xmath44 is also much larger than @xmath45 .",
    "the mixing will reduce the usual higgs mass @xmath45 .",
    "however , since the parameter @xmath48 is not fixed , if it is small enough the reduction in higgs mass can be neglected . in any case",
    ", the effects of the mixing and also other term in the higgs potential involving @xmath28 and @xmath34 will not affect our discussions in the following .",
    "we will not discuss them further here .",
    "the relic density of the dark matter is controlled by annihilation of @xmath49 .",
    "the annihilation rate of dark matter @xmath50 , with lepton masses neglected and summed over the two types of charged leptons and neutrinos , is given by @xmath51 where @xmath37 is the relative velocity of the two annihilating dark matter and @xmath41 is the total dark matter pair energy squared in the center of mass frame .",
    "@xmath52 is the decay width of the @xmath5 boson .",
    "if the @xmath5 mass is below the @xmath53 threshold which we will assume , the dominant decay modes of @xmath5 are @xmath54 , and @xmath52 is given by , neglecting lepton masses @xmath55    in eqs .",
    "( [ cs ] ) and ( [ dr ] ) , we have assumed that there are only left - handed light neutrinos . if there are light right - handed neutrinos to pair up with left - handed neutrinos to form dirac neutrinos , the factor 3 in these equations should be changed to 4 .",
    "since the relic density of dm is determined by the annihilation rate , the model parameters are thus constrained .",
    "the same parameters will also determine the annihilation rate producing the electron / positron excess observed today , which requires a much larger annihilation rate .",
    "a boost factor in the range 100 to 1000 is necessary .",
    "we find that breit - wigner resonance enhancement mechanism works very well in our models if the @xmath5 boson mass is about two times of the dark matter mass .",
    "the boost factor in this case comes from the fact that since the @xmath56 mass @xmath57 is close to two times of the dark matter mass @xmath58 , the annihilate rate is close to the resonant point and is very sensitive to the thermal kinetic energy of dark matter . to see this",
    "let us rewrite the annihilation rate into a pair of charged leptons as @xmath59 where we have used the non - relativistic limit of @xmath60 , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 defined as @xmath63 , and @xmath64 .    for thermal dark matter",
    ", the velocity @xmath65 is proportional to the thermal energy of dark matter .",
    "it is clear that for small enough @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the annihilation rate is very sensitive to the thermal energy and therefore the thermal temperature t. at lower dark matter thermal energies , the annihilation rate is enhanced compared with that at higher temperature .",
    "this results in a very different picture of dark matter annihilation than the case for the usual non - resonant annihilation where the annihilation rate is not sensitive to dark matter thermal energies .",
    "the annihilation process does not freeze out even after the usual `` freeze out '' time in the non - resonant annihilation case due to the enhanced annihilation rate at lower energies . to produce the observed dark matter relic density ,",
    "the annihilation rate at zero temperature is required to be larger than the usual one , and therefor a boost factor . with appropriate @xmath61 and @xmath62 , a large enough boost factor can be produced .    for a detailed discussion , a precise form for the thermally averaged annihilation rate",
    "should be used which can be written as@xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the internal degrees of freedom of dm particle which is equal to 4 for a vector fermion , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the modified bessel functions of the second type .     as a function of time @xmath71 . ]",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ boost ] the thermally averaged annihilation rate @xmath72 as a function of cosmic time @xmath73 for several values of parameters @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "the annihilation rate when `` freeze out '' at @xmath74 is adopted as a normalization to illustrate the enhancement effect today .     as a function of @xmath71 , compared with the equilibrium abundance @xmath75 and the experimental measurements @xmath76 @xcite . ]    to precisely determine the parameters we solve the standard boltzmann equation of the decoupling process numerically .",

    "the parameter @xmath79 is adjusted to make sure that today s dm abundance is correct @xmath80 .",
    "we now discuss the dm annihilation produced electron / positron spectrum in the @xmath81 dm models for all the three possibilities discussed before : a ) @xmath82 ; b ) @xmath83 ; and c ) @xmath84 . in all these cases ,",
    "2/3 of the dm annihilate into charged lepton pairs and 1/3 into neutrino pairs , therefore the required boost factor should be 1.5 times of the case for dm only annihilate into charged lepton pairs .    after the electron / positron pairs produced by dm annihilation they propagate diffusively in the galaxy due to the scattering with random magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the propagation processes in the galaxy is calculated numerically in order to compare with data measured at the earth .",
    "the interactions with interstellar medium , mainly the synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering processes , will lead to energy losses of the primary electrons and positrons .",
    "in addition , the overall convection driven by the galactic wind and reacceleration due to the interstellar shock will also affect the electron spectrum . in this work",
    "we solve the propagation equation numerically adopting the galprop package @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ elec ] we show the model predictions on the @xmath85 fraction and @xmath86 fluxes together with the observational data .",

    "@xcite , to fit atic and pamela data we adopt the dm mass @xmath87 1 tev and merritt density profile .",
    "in addition for the @xmath19 ( model c ) we also plot the spectrum with dm mass @xmath88 tev to fit the fermi result . a boost factor @xmath89 ( we have included the branching ratio into neutrinos which do not produce electron / positron excess ) , instead of the one @xmath90 as shown in fig .

    "we did not take the errors of fermi data into account since they have very small statistic errors .",
    "we also plot an @xmath99 curve which gives correct relic density while setting @xmath99 .",
    "the overlap between the @xmath99 curve with the shaded region gives the correct relic density and boost factor to account for atic and pamela data with universal gauge couplings between dark matter and sm leptons .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath101 with @xmath99 is @xmath102 .",
    "then we have @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath99 to give correct relic density and boost factor . similarly for the model to fit pamela / fermi data we have @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in principle there",

    "for @xmath108 case , one can extract @xmath27 and @xmath109 separately from fig .",
    "[ elec ] by the fact @xmath110 in our models with a known @xmath111 .",
    "an interesting thing to note is that the @xmath24 charge of the dark matter does not need to be very different from the sm leptons .",
    "in this paper we studied a class of leptophilic dark matter model with @xmath8 gauge interactions to account for the recent cosmic ray results .",
    "we have shown that two of the anomaly free gauged @xmath8 models , the gauged @xmath112 and @xmath18 models , can naturally explain the excess in electron / positron spectrum at atic , while another model with @xmath19 gauge coupling can naturally account for the electron spectrum at fermi .",
    "we have seen that in order to fit data the regions allowed for @xmath109 and @xmath27 are constrained to narrow regions . plus",
    "the facts that the dark matter is required to be about 1 tev to explain the sharp falling in electron / positron excess at atic or about 1.5 tev to best fit the fermi and hess data , and @xmath5 mass is required to be about two times of the dark matter mass to have a large boos factor via the breit - wigner enhancement mechanism , the models parameters are all determined in narrow regions .",
    "since the model parameters are restricted to narrow regions , one has to check if the constraints on the models are compatible with other processes .",
    "a closely related process is direct dark matter search .",
    "the annihilation process , @xmath113 , producing the relic dark matter density and the electron / positron excess , is related to the direct detection process by changing the interaction from s - channel to t - channel , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "one may worry if the enhanced s - channel cross section , a large boost factor , will also lead to a large t - channel cross section resulting in conflict with direct detection results .",
    "this is not the case .    for @xmath115 collision with @xmath26 mass of around 1 tev ( or 1.5 tev ) , the energy transferred to the electron is very small , at the ev order , far below the threshold energy of present detectors .",
    "however , if the dark matter particle @xmath26 kicks out a tightly bound electron , the energy transferred to the electron may be larger and detectable .",
    "but even this happens , the interaction cross section for the t - channel is still too small because in this case there is no briet - wigner enhancement , @xmath116 . here",
    "@xmath117 indicates a free electron or a tightly bound electron . using the bounds on the model parameters obtained before , we find that the cross section is of order @xmath118 , which is well below the sensitivities of the present detectors .",
    "low energy processes such as g-2 of electron , muon or tauon , @xmath119 collision data , and also high energy experiments at lep have put stringent constraints on possible electron interaction with new gauge particles . however , in contributions from @xmath5 are all proportional to @xmath120 which is of order @xmath121(gev@xmath122 . if @xmath27 is of order one there is no conflict with data .",
    "direct production of @xmath5 will be very difficult at lhc since at tree level the @xmath5 only interacts directly with electron , muon / tauon .",
    "ilc will not be able to produce directly @xmath5 either since its energy is below the @xmath5 mass .",
    "but @xmath5 can be produced at clic for models a ) and b ) where the @xmath123 center of mass frame energy can be as high as @xmath124 tev .",
    "it may be interesting to scan the machine energy around the @xmath56 resonant region to discover it .",
    "the decay widths of @xmath56 in models considered here are of order 10 mev .",
    "this requires a very careful scanning . for model c ) , a muon collider may provide a chance to produce the relevant @xmath5 boson .",
    "finally we point out that our study can be easily extended to a larger group of dark matter models that are leptophilic .",
    "once we assume the breit - wigner enhancement takes effect to explain both the relic density and positron excess today the model parameters can be determined within a quite definite range , which should be similar to the present results .    in summary , in the present work we have constructed simple dark matter models with gauged @xmath0 interactions .",
    "we have shown that the direct electron component in the annihilation final states are necessary to account for the sharp falling at the atic electron spectrum at @xmath125gev .",
    "the @xmath126 and @xmath127 models with the dark matter mass around 1 tev are in excellent agreement with atic data .",
    "however , to explain fermi data which does not show the sharp falling indicated by atic data , one should avoid having direct electron component .",
    "this fact favors @xmath128 model .",
    "all these models predict quite definite coupling constant , @xmath5 mass and width , which are consistent with all present collider and other low energy data .    at present atic or fermi data",
    "is consistent with pamela data separately , but atic and fermi data do not agree with each other .",
    "although one can find models which fit one of the two data sets , i ) pamela and atic , and ii ) pamela and fermi , it is obvious that these models can not simultaneously all be correct . to finally decide which dm model is correct , experimental data have to give an unique set of data which can only be achieved by future improved experiments .",
    "only by then one can decide the correct dark matter model .",

    "<S> in this work we study a class of leptophilic dark matter models , where the dark matter interacts with the standard model particles via the @xmath0 gauge boson , to explain the @xmath1 excess in cosmic rays observed by atic and pamela experiments , and more recently by fermi experiment . </S>",
    "<S> there are three types of @xmath0 models : a ) @xmath2 , b ) @xmath3 , and c ) @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> although atic or fermi data is consistent with pamela data separately , atic and fermi data do not agree with each other . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore aim to identify which of the three models can explain which data set better . </S>",
    "<S> we find that models a ) and b ) can give correct dark matter relic density and explain the atic and pamela data simultaneously recur to the breit - wigner enhancement . whereas model c ) with a larger @xmath5 mass can explain fermi and pamela data simultaneously . in all cases the model parameters </S>",
    "<S> are restricted to narrow regions . </S>",
    "<S> future improved data will decide which set of data are correct and also help to decide the correct dark matter model . </S>"
