    "the free boundary @xmath19 sometimes is said to be _ thin _ , to indicate that it is ( expected to be ) of codimension two .",
    "one of the most interesting questions in this problem is the study of the structure and the regularity of the free boundary @xmath19 .    to put our results in a proper perspective , below we give a brief overview of some of the known results in the literature",
    ". the proofs can be found in @xcite and in chapter  9 of @xcite .",
    "we start by noting that we can extend solutions @xmath13 of the signorini problem  to the entire ball @xmath2 in two different ways : either by even symmetry in @xmath20 variable or by odd symmetry",
    ". the even extension will be harmonic in @xmath21 , while the odd extension will be so in @xmath22 . in a sense",
    ", those two extensions can be viewed as two different branches of a two - valued harmonic function .",
    "this gives a heuristic explanation for the monotonicity of almgren s _ frequency function _",
    "@xmath23 which goes back to almgren s study of multi - valued harmonic functions @xcite",
    ". in particular , the limiting value @xmath24 for @xmath25 turns out to be a very effective tool in classifying free boundary points . by using the monotonicity of the frequency @xmath26",
    ", it can be shown that the rescalings @xmath27 converge , over subsequences @xmath28 , to solutions @xmath29 of the signorini problem  in @xmath30 .",
    "such limits are known as _",
    "blowups _ of @xmath13 at @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that such blowups will be homogeneous of degree @xmath32 , regardless of the sequence @xmath33 .",
    "it is readily seen from the the definition that the mapping @xmath34 is upper semicontinuous on @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that @xmath35 for every @xmath25 and , more precisely , that the following alternative holds : @xmath36 this brings us to the notion of a regular point .",
    "a point @xmath37 is called _ regular _ if @xmath38 . by classifying all possible homogeneous solutions of homogeneity @xmath39 ,",
    "the above definition is equivalent to saying that the blowups of @xmath13 at @xmath31 have the form @xmath40 after a possible rotation of coordinate axes in @xmath41 .    in what follows",

    ", we are interested in the higher regularity of @xmath42 .",
    "since the codimension of the free boundary @xmath19 is two , this question is meaningful only when @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , in dimension @xmath48 the complete characterization of the coincidence set and the free boundary was already found by lewy @xcite : @xmath49 is a locally finite union of closed intervals .",
    "we will use fairly standard notations in this paper . by @xmath3",
    "we denote the @xmath50-dimensional euclidean space of points @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . for any @xmath54",
    "we denote @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "we also identify @xmath57 with @xmath58 , thereby effectively embedding @xmath41 into @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we identify @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "for @xmath62 ,",
    "@xmath63 if @xmath31 is the origin , we will simply write @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . let @xmath68 be the euclidean distance between two sets @xmath69 .",
    "in this paper we are interested in local properties of the solutions and their free boundaries only near regular points and therefore , without loss of generality , we make the following assumptions .",
    "we will assume that @xmath13 solves the signorini problem  in @xmath70 and that all free boundary points in @xmath71 are regular , i.e. @xmath72 furthermore , we will assume that there exists @xmath73 with @xmath74 such that @xmath75 next we assume @xmath76 and that @xmath77 moreover , we will also assume the following nondegeneracy property for directional derivatives in a cone of tangential directions : for any @xmath78 , there exist @xmath79 and @xmath80 such that @xmath81 for any @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the unit normal in @xmath41 to @xmath19 at @xmath31 outward to @xmath49 and @xmath84 for a unit vector @xmath85 .",
    "we explicitly remark that if @xmath13 is a solution to the signorini problem , then the assumptions - hold at any regular free boundary point after a possible translation , rotation and rescaling of @xmath13 ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .      following the approach of kinderlehrer and nirenberg @xcite in the classical obstacle problem , we will use the partial hodograph - legendre transformation method to improve on the known regularity of the free boundary .",
    "the idea is to straighten the free boundary and then apply the boundary regularity of the solution to the transformed elliptic pde .",
    "this works relatively simply for the classical obstacle problem , and allows to prove @xmath86 regularity and even the real analyticity of the free boundary .    in the signorini problem ,",
    "the free boundary @xmath19 is of codimension two , and in order to straighten both @xmath19 and @xmath49 we need to make a partial hodograph transform in two variables .",
    "namely , for @xmath13 satisfying the assumptions in section  [ sec : assumptions ] , consider the transformation @xmath87 consider also the associated partial legendre transform of @xmath13 given by @xmath88 formally , the inverse of @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 and we can recover the free boundary in the following way : @xmath91 however , we note that the mapping @xmath89 is only @xmath0 regular and even the local invertibility of such mapping is rather nontrivial . besides , even if one has a local invertibility of @xmath89 , the function @xmath92 will satisfy a degenerate elliptic equation , and apriori it is not clear if the equation will have enough structure to be useful .",
    "concerning the first complication , we make a careful asymptotic analysis based the precise knowledge of the blowups , and this does allow to establish the local invertibility of @xmath89 .",
    "[ thm : t - invert ] let @xmath13 be a solution of the signorini problem  in @xmath70 , satisfying the assumptions in section  [ sec : assumptions ] .",
    "then , there exists a small @xmath93 such that the partial hodograph transformation @xmath89 in is injective in @xmath94 .",
    "then via an asymptotic analysis of @xmath92 at the straightened free boundary points , we observe that the fully nonlinear degenerate elliptic equation for @xmath92 has a subelliptic structure , which can be viewed as a perturbation of the baouendi - grushin operator . then using the @xmath1 theory for the baouendi - grushin operator and a bootstrapping argument",
    ", we obtain the smoothness and even the real analyticity of @xmath92 .",
    "[ thm : fb - regul ] let @xmath13 be as in theorem  [ thm : t - invert ] and @xmath92 be given by",
    ". then exists @xmath95 such that the mapping @xmath96 is real analytic on @xmath97 .",
    "in particular , @xmath98 is locally an analytic surface .",
    "the signorini problem is just one example of a problem with thin free boundaries .",
    "many problems with thin free boundaries arise when studying problems for the fractional laplacian and using the caffarelli - silvestre extension @xcite to localize the problem at the expense of adding an extra dimension ( which makes the free boundary `` thin '' ) .",
    "thus , the signorini problem can be viewed as an obstacle problem for half - laplacian , see @xcite .",
    "we hope that the methods in this paper can be used to study the higher regularity of the free boundary in many such problems .",
    "a different approach to the study of the higher regularity of thin free boundaries is being developed by de silva and savin @xcite . in particular , in @xcite they prove the @xmath86 regularity of @xmath99 free boundaries in the thin analogue of alt - caffarelli minimization problem @xcite . their method is based on schauder - type estimates rather than hodograph - legendre transform used in this paper .    at about the same time as we completed this work , de silva and savin @xcite extended their approach to include the signorini problem , as well as lowered the initial regularity assumption on the free boundary to @xmath46 .",
    "the main ingredient in their proof is an interesting new higher order boundary harnack principle , applicable to regular , as well as slit domains ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :    - in section  [ sec : nond - prop ] we study the so - called @xmath39-homogeneous blowups of the solutions near regular points .",
    "this is achieved by a combination a boundary hopf - type principle in domains with @xmath46 slits , as well as weiss- and monneau - type monotonicity formulas .    - in section  [ sec : hodograph ] we introduce the partial hodograph transformation and show it is a homeomorphism in a neighborhood of the regular free boundary points .",
    "this is achieved by using the precise behavior of the solutions near regular free boundary points established in section  [ sec : nond - prop ] .    - in section  [ sec : legendre - funct - nonl ] we consider the corresponding legendre transform @xmath92 and show some basic regularity of @xmath92 inherited from @xmath13 .    - in section  [ sec : smoothness ] we study the fully nonlinear pde satisfied by @xmath92 , which is the transformed pde of @xmath13 .",
    "we show the linearization of the pde is a perturbation of the baouendi - grushin operator . using the @xmath1 estimates available for this operator , and a bootstrapping argument",
    ", we obtain the smoothness of @xmath92 , which in turn implies the smoothness of the free boundary .    - in section  [ sec : analyticity ] , we give more careful estimates on the derivatives of @xmath92 which imply that @xmath92 , and consequently @xmath19 , is real analytic .",
    "we start our study by establishing a stronger nondegeneracy property for the tangential derivatives @xmath100 than the one given in .",
    "namely , we want to improve the lower bound in to a multiple of @xmath101 . to achieve this",
    ", we construct a barrier function by using the @xmath46-regularity of @xmath19 , to obtain a result that can be viewed as a version of the boundary hopf lemma for the domains of the type @xmath102 .",
    "to proceed , we introduce some notations . for @xmath103 ,",
    "let @xmath104    [ lem : hopf - barrier ] there exists a continuous function @xmath105 on @xmath106 and a small @xmath107 such that @xmath108 and @xmath109    inspired by the construction in @xcite , we will show that the following function satisfies the conditions of the lemma : @xmath110 we next verify each of the properties  in the lemma .    first of all , is immediate .",
    "next , since @xmath111 , we have @xmath112 therefore , on @xmath113 one has @xmath114 hence there exists @xmath107 such that @xmath115 on @xmath116 . this implies .",
    "further , to show , notice that @xmath117 which yields @xmath118 for small @xmath119 , as claimed .",
    "next , we show .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath120 and @xmath121 satisfy @xmath122 @xmath123 combining  , we obtain that for @xmath124 @xmath125 \\\\\\geq\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\hat f''_\\alpha(u)+(2n-3)\\frac{\\hat f'_\\alpha(u)}{u}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\hat f''_\\alpha(|x|^{1/2})+(2n-3)\\frac{\\hat f'_\\alpha(|x|^{1/2})}{|x|^{1/2}}\\right).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since @xmath126 and @xmath127 is decreasing on @xmath128 , then by we have @xmath129 in @xmath130 .",
    "this shows .",
    "finally , by , we have @xmath131 this completes the proof of the lemma .    using the function constructed in lemma  [ lem : hopf - barrier ] as a barrier",
    ", we have the improvement of the nondegeneracy for nonnegative harmonic functions in @xmath130 .",
    "[ cor : hopf1 ] let @xmath132 be a nonnegative superharmonic function in @xmath130 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 on @xmath135 .",

    "then by and the continuity of @xmath140 , there exists @xmath141 such that @xmath142 which combined with  gives that @xmath143 then , by the maximum principle @xmath144 in particular , @xmath145 for @xmath146 with @xmath107 small .    from lemma  [ cor : hopf1 ]",

    "however , by a simple scaling , we can make @xmath157 .",
    "thus , there exists @xmath158 and @xmath159 such that holds .      for our further study",
    ", we need to consider the following rescalings @xmath160 with @xmath37 .",
    "note that these are different form rescalings in the sense that the @xmath161 norm of @xmath13 is not preserved under the rescaling , but it is better suited for the study of regular points .",
    "first , from the growth estimate ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath162 for @xmath82 , where @xmath163 and @xmath164 , we know that the family @xmath165 is locally uniformly bounded . moreover , by the interior @xmath166 estimate ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath167 we get that @xmath165 is uniformly bounded in @xmath168 .",

    "furthermore , it is important to note that @xmath174 is nonzero , because of the nondegeneracy provided by proposition  [ prop : hopf ] .",

    "<S> however , the equation has a subelliptic structure and can be viewed as a perturbation of the baouendi - grushin operator . by using the @xmath1 theory available for that operator , we can bootstrap the regularity of the legendre transform up to real analyticity , which implies the real analyticity of the free boundary . </S>"
