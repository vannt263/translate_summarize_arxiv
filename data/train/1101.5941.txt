    "when a liquid freezes into a crystalline solid its continuous symmetry of translation and rotation is broken into one of the bravais lattices . in three dimensions",
    "the freezing of a liquid into a crystalline solid is known to be first - order symmetry breaking transition marked by large discontinuities in entropy , density and order parameters .",

    "but when the liquid is supercooled bypassing its crystallization , it continues to remain in amorphous state . with increase in density a solid like phase emerges with molecules getting localized around their mean position on a random structure .",
    "the underlying lattice on which such localized motion takes place is related to the time scale of relaxation in the supercooled liquid . while the supercooled liquid starts to attain solidlike properties , structurally it does not have any long range order like the one present in the crystal .",

    "for an amorphous structure of hard spheres this reduces to @xmath253    note that for isotropic fluid the third term of above equation is zero ; the bifurcation of pressure line from that of normal fluid starts as soon as particles start getting localized .",
    "localization of particles also leads to crossover from nonactivated to activated dynamics and considerable increase in relaxation time .",
    "a free - energy functional that contains both the symmetry conserved part of the dpcf @xmath93 and the symmetry broken part @xmath254 has been used to investigate the freezing of a system of hard spheres into crystalline and amorphous structures .",
    "the values of @xmath93 and its derivatives with respect to density @xmath255 as a function of distance @xmath104 have been found using integral equation theory comprising the oz equation and a closure relation proposed by roger and young @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath254 we used an expansion in ascending powers of order parameters .",
    "this expansion involves higher - body direct correlation functions of the isotropic phase which in turn was found from the density derivatives of @xmath93 . for this we used the ansatz",
    "@xmath129 $ ] embodied in eqs.@xmath256 and @xmath135 .",
    "the contribution made by the symmetry broken term to the free - energy at the freezing point ( liquid - crystal transition point ) was found to be about @xmath257 of the symmetry conserving part .",
    "though this contribution is small but , as shown in table @xmath59 , it improves the agreement between theoretical values of the freezing parameters and the values found from simulations . this result and",
    "the results reported earlier @xmath38 $ ] for the power law fluids show that the contributions of the symmetry broken part of free - energy increases with the softness of the potential .",
    "this explains why the ry free - energy functional was found to give reasonably good description of freezing transition of hard spheres fluid but failed for potentials which have soft core and/or attractive tail .",
    "these results also indicate that the theory described here can be used to describe the freezing transitions of all kind of potentials .",
    "we used the free - energy functional to investigate the question of having metastable states in between the homogeneous liquid and the regular crystalline state .",
    "the value of site - site correlation function @xmath66 which provides the structural description of the amorphous structure have been taken from molecular dynamics simulation of granular system subjected to a sequence of vertical tapes @xmath219 $ ] .",
    "the system has been found to behave like a glass - forming system .",
    "the reason for our choosing this data is that they are available at @xmath258 @xmath219 $ ] and therefore can be directly used in the theory without using approximations such as scaling relation @xmath259 . using the data of @xmath66 at @xmath220 and @xmath221 from ref @xmath219 $ ] we examined the stability of amorphous structures with respect to homogeneous fluid .",
    "the minimum of free - energy found at @xmath260 suggests that the structures are stable compared to that of the fluid and corresponds to a density distribution of overlapping gaussians centered around an amorphous lattice .",
    "this kind of structure may be associated with deeply supercooled states with a heterogeneous density profile .",
    "the transition of the liquid into any of these states will be determined by considering the dynamics of fluctuations around these minima .",
    "the glassy minimum is separated from the homogeneous liquid minimum by an energy barrier which height increases with the density .    among future applications it will be instructive to investigate the contribution made by the second term of eq.@xmath123 to free - energy of different potentials , application of the theory to freezing transition in two dimensions , in particular to examine the melting through hexatic phase which other density functional schemes have failed to show and to examine the possibility of calculating total pair correlation functions of frozen phases using the oz equation .      99 p. m. chaikin and t. c. lubensky , principles of condensed matter physics ( cambridge university press , 1995 ) m. d. ediger , c. a. angell and s. nagel , j. phys .",
