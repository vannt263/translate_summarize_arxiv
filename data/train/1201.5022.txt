    "<S> the evolution of spin dynamics from the quantum critical system ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 to the stable trivalent yb system ybco@xmath0si@xmath0 was investigated by electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectroscopy . while the kondo temperature changes by one order of magnitude , all compositions of the single crystalline series yb(rh@xmath1co@xmath2)@xmath3si@xmath3 show well defined esr spectra with a clear yb@xmath4 character for temperatures below @xmath5k . with </S>",
    "<S> increasing co - content the esr @xmath6-factor along the @xmath7-direction strongly increases indicating a continuous change of the ground state wave function and , thus , a continuous change of the crystal electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the linewidth presents a complex dependence on the co - content and is discussed in terms of the co - doping dependence of the kondo interaction , the magnetic anisotropy and the influence of ferromagnetic correlations between the 4@xmath8 states . </S>",
    "<S> the results provide evidence that , for low co - doping , the kondo interaction allows narrow esr spectra despite the presence of a large magnetic anisotropy , whereas at high co - concentrations , the linewidth is controlled by ferromagnetic correlations . a pronounced broadening due to critical correlations at low temperatures </S>",
