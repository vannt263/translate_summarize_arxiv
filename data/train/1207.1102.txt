    "one of the deepest mysteries of contemporary cosmology is the nature of the observed accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "so far , its evolution can be described remarkably well by einstein s theory of gravitation including a nonzero cosmological constant @xmath2 . however , in order to fit the astronomical observations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , @xmath2 must be many orders of magnitude smaller than what our standard model of particle physics would expect .",
    "this _ hierarchy problem _ inspired various departures from the cosmological standard model , such as modifications of einstein s field equations or the introduction of exotic forms of matter .",
    "a particularly sensitive probe of cosmology is the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys map out large fractions of its observable volume and thereby reconstruct a three - dimensional map of density fluctuations whose statistical properties directly relate to fundamental cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this reconstruction is hampered by the fact that galaxies are _ biased _ and _ stochastic _ tracers of the dominating dark matter density field . even if the density field could be inferred perfectly well",
    ", the finite number @xmath3 of independent fourier modes in the survey sets a fundamental lower limit on the achievable uncertainty , which is known as _ sampling variance _ ( or _ cosmic variance _ , in case the survey size is the whole observable universe ) .",
    "for example , in a measurement of the dark matter power spectrum @xmath4 , the sampling variance limit is given by @xmath5 , an uncertainty floor that propagates into all the parameters one wants to infer from @xmath4 .",
    "this limit decreases towards smaller scales as more and more fourier modes can be sampled , but at the same time linear theory starts to break down and higher - order perturbation theory has to be adopted to model @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "further complication arises in relating the observed galaxy power spectrum to the latter , as galaxy bias becomes nonlinear and nonlocal @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to accurately probe cosmological parameters is to consider multiple tracers of the density field within the well - understood linear regime .",
    "the relative clustering amplitude between multiple tracers can be inferred without sampling variance limitation because the underlying density fluctuations cancel out in taking ratios  @xcite .",
    "therefore , any cosmological information that remains in the relative clustering amplitude between different tracers can potentially be inferred with a much higher accuracy .    in this paper",
    "we focus on a particular contribution to the clustering amplitude of galaxies coming from redshift - space distortions ( rsd ) .",
    "these are caused by peculiar velocities along the line of sight , causing their clustering statistics to become anisotropic .",
    "first treated as a contamination , this effect has been realized to be a powerful probe of cosmology , as an understanding of rsd allows to infer the growth rate of structure formation , which is directly tied to the expansion history of the universe as well as the theory of gravity  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    after recapping the fundamentals of rsd and introducing a general formalism for the multitracer analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] , we present our results on the rsd analysis from @xmath0-body simulations in sec .",
    "finally we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "in galaxy surveys , radial distances are inferred via the individual redshift of objects , assuming they follow the hubble flow . due to gravitational attraction ,",
    "however , galaxies ( respectively , their host halos ) build up peculiar velocities @xmath6 which contribute to their redshift via the doppler effect .",
    "hence , the real - space and redshift - space locations @xmath7 and @xmath8 of a galaxy are related as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the unit vector along the line of sight and @xmath11 is the hubble constant as a function of redshift @xmath12 . on large scales , gravity causes coherent infall of test particles into the potential wells of the dark matter .",
    "thus , galaxies are moving towards overdense regions in the universe , resulting in an enhancement of their inferred overdensity along the line of sight . according to linear perturbation theory ,",
    "the redshift - space and real - space galaxy overdensities are related as @xmath13 where @xmath14 the cosine of the angle between any wave vector @xmath15 in the survey and the line of sight , @xmath16 the dark matter overdensity field and @xmath17 the _ growth rate _ of structure .",
    "this well - known result @xcite further makes use of the plane - parallel approximation , assuming the separation of any galaxy pair to be much smaller than their distance to the observer . on nonlinear scales ,",
    "random motions are generated in the process of virialization , which causes a damping in the clustering amplitude of galaxies along the line of sight .",
    "this so - called finger - of - god effect is often modeled phenomenologically by an additional gaussian damping factor in eq .",
    "( [ kaiser ] )  @xcite , but more elaborate schemes have been developed  ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will neglect nonlinear corrections in this paper and focus on the large linear scales .",
    "the growth rate @xmath17 is the logarithmic derivative of the growth factor @xmath18 with respect to the scale factor @xmath19 . in linear theory , it can be expressed as @xmath20 with the matter density parameter @xmath21 and the _ growth index _",
    "@xcite . in einstein gravity",
    "the value of @xmath22 is about @xmath23 , but can take on distinctly different values in modified gravity scenarios @xcite .",
    "therefore , constraints on the growth rate can provide viable tests on the theory of gravitation .",
    "galaxies only form in specific , discrete locations of the density field ; they are referred to as _ biased _ and _ stochastic _ tracers of the dark matter . on linear scales , this relation can be described locally by @xmath24 where the factor @xmath25 is the _ linear galaxy bias _ and @xmath26 a random variable denoted as _",
    "shot noise _ , describing the stochastic nature of this relation . both @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    "depend on redshift , as well as various properties of the type of galaxies one is considering ( e.g. , luminosity , color , host - halo mass ) .    together with eq .",
    "( [ kaiser ] ) this yields a model for the overdensity field of galaxies in redshift space , @xmath27 since the phenomena of galaxy biasing and rsd are to multiply the density field @xmath16 by some factor , we can simply define a more general _ effective bias _",
    "parameter @xmath28 that contains both contributions , @xmath29 in the following , we will drop the superscript that distinguishes between real - space and redshift - space quantities for clarity .",
    "if not explicitly mentioned otherwise , all symbols should be understood as given in redshift space .      in order to exploit the gains of sampling variance and shot noise cancellation ,",
    "we need to consider multiple tracers of the dark matter density field @xcite .",
    "one way to achieve this is splitting some galaxy catalog into bins of a certain observable property of the galaxies ( like luminosity , color , host - halo mass , etc . ) .",
    "however , the following framework is not limited to galaxies and may be adopted for other tracers of the dark matter density field as well .",
    "we start by writing the density fields of @xmath0 tracers as a vector @xmath30 .",
    "the outer product of this vector , once ensemble averaged within a @xmath31-shell in fourier space , yields the covariance matrix @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 symbol denotes the hermitian conjugate ( transpose and complex conjugation ) . plugging in the model for galaxy overdensities in redshift space from eq .",

    "@xmath37 ( by definition @xmath38 ) .",
    "the covariance matrix contains all auto - power and cross - power spectra of the considered tracers , so in total @xmath39 independent elements per @xmath31-shell .",
    "however , since all tracers follow the same dark matter density distribution , these elements are correlated .",
    "let us compare the analysis for a single tracer with the one for two tracers . from a single tracer we can only observe an estimator of its auto - power spectrum @xmath40 where we define @xmath41 . in this parametrization",
    "it is obvious to see that @xmath25 is degenerate with the power spectrum @xmath4 ; respectively , its normalization @xmath42 defined via @xmath43 where @xmath44 describes the shape of the power spectrum and is assumed to be known , at least up to linear order . from eq .",
    "( [ single_tracer ] ) , only the combination @xmath45 can be determined at @xmath46 ( usually , the shot noise is assumed to be poissonian , meaning it is scale independent and given by the inverse number density of galaxies @xmath47 ) .",
    "the same is true for the growth rate @xmath17 , we can only determine the product @xmath48\\left(1 + 2\\beta\\mu^2\\right)}{\\mu^4 } \\ ; , \\label{f^2p}\\ ] ] but this does not apply for @xmath49 , which can be extracted directly from observations of @xmath50 where @xmath51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that in this case the achievable error on @xmath49 is limited by the sampling variance inherent to @xmath4 . in case",
    "two distinct tracers of the density field with biases @xmath25 and @xmath52 are observed , where @xmath53 is their relative galaxy bias , we obtain the three following power spectra : @xmath54 the degree to how well they are correlated is quantified by the cross - correlation coefficient @xmath55 , so in the idealistic case of no shot noise ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 and the ratios @xmath58 all yield the same expression , which is independent of @xmath4 .",
    "hence , a combination of observations at different @xmath14 yields @xmath53 and @xmath49 without sampling variance @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in realistic surveys @xmath59 , so @xmath4 will not cancel out completely and the three ratios will be different and scale dependent .",
    "this gives rise to residual sampling variance inherent to a measurement of @xmath53 and @xmath49 , which in general can be much smaller than in the single - tracer case . in turn , a better measurement of @xmath49 allows a more precise estimate on @xmath60 [ see eq .",
    "( [ f^2p ] ) ] .",
    "however , the accuracy on @xmath60 is still limited by sampling variance , yielding @xmath61 , respectively @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "if both @xmath63 _ and _ @xmath16 are known , we can simply add the dark matter overdensity mode @xmath16 to the overdensities of the tracers and write @xmath64 . in this case",
    ", the effective bias can be obtained directly by taking the ratio @xmath65 .",
    "the covariance matrix then becomes @xmath66 with @xmath67 independent elements .",
    "now the degeneracy between @xmath25 , @xmath42 and @xmath17 is lifted because @xmath4 is known separately .",
    "considering the cross - correlation coefficient of a tracer @xmath68 with the dark matter @xmath69 , we find @xmath70 so the deviation of @xmath71 from unity is only controlled by the shot noise of the tracer .",
    "again , if @xmath72 , the dark matter power spectrum disappears completely , so that @xmath25 and @xmath17 can be determined without sampling variance .      in order to determine more quantitatively",
    "how much information on cosmology is buried in the clustering statistics of biased tracers and the dark matter , we have to compute the fisher information matrix @xcite , a derivation of which is presented in the following : we start with a multivariate gaussian likelihood of the data vector @xmath63 @xmath73 which is a reasonable assumption on large scales , where @xmath74 .",

    "the single - tracer term is suppressed by a factor @xmath89 as compared to the multitracer term . by definition ,",
    "the latter vanishes for the case of only one tracer , since then @xmath90 and eq .  ( [ f_h ] ) simplifies to @xmath91 while the fisher information for multiple tracers can in principle become infinite in the limit of no shot noise , eq .",

    "we consider two sets of parameters separately : the ones that influence only the effective bias , @xmath93 and the ones that go into the matter power spectrum , @xmath94 the elements of the shot noise matrix are usually not considered as quantities of interest , but as nuisance parameters that can be marginalized over . from eq .",
    "( [ f_h ] ) it is evident that there are degeneracies between @xmath95 and @xmath96 due to mixed terms of the form @xmath97 .",

    "the effective bias can be determined exactly , allowing an exact measurement of the parameters @xmath95  @xcite . on the other hand , constraints on the parameters @xmath96",
    "are always limited by the variance of the power spectrum @xmath104 .",
    "here , there are no mixed terms depending both on the effective bias and the power spectrum , so parameter degeneracies between @xmath95 and @xmath96 are absent .",

    "( [ f_h ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ f_m ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the growth rate @xmath17 can not be determined from a galaxy redshift survey alone , since it is degenerate with the power spectrum @xmath4 , respectively its normalization @xmath42 .",
    "this degeneracy can only be broken with knowledge of the dark matter density field , or other prior constraints .",
    "for this reason it is sometimes convenient to reparametrize by the mapping @xmath106 where @xmath107 is an arbitrary reference galaxy bias so that @xmath108 is the relative galaxy bias of all considered tracers to this reference .",
    "this mapping leaves the covariance matrix from eq .",
    "( [ cov ] ) unchanged .",
    "we can conveniently choose the lowest bias of all tracers as the reference , @xmath109 , such that @xmath110 is always larger than unity and @xmath111 .",
    "another popular parametrization  is @xmath112 with @xmath113 being some arbitrary reference normalization of the power spectrum , which we choose to be identical with our simulation input value of @xmath114 . in this paper",
    "we will quote constraints on both @xmath49 and @xmath115 when considering a galaxy redshift survey only , and on @xmath17 when the latter is combined with dark matter observations .",
    "our numerical analysis is based on a high - resolution @xmath0-body simulation performed at the university of zrich supercomputer zbox3 with the gadget-2 code @xcite .",

    "( [ rsd ] ) using the velocities of the halos along the three independent directions of the box ( @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath12 axis ) .",

    "parameter uncertainties are calculated via the jacobian of the chi square , which is determined numerically using finite - difference derivatives .      in order to fully exploit the benefits of the multitracer approach",
    ", the question remains on how to ideally construct different tracers from a given galaxy catalog . in this section",
    "we will derive the answer to that question and test it on the basis of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "a quantity that plays a crucial role for the cosmological information content contained in the two - point clustering statistics of lss is the clustering signal - to - noise ratio @xmath136 . for dark matter halos",

    "we denote these components with a plus and a minus subscript , according to their super- and sub - poissonian shot noise levels , respectively . in this manner",
    "we can expand the clustering signal - to - noise ratio as @xmath137 where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the @xmath0 eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the shot noise matrix @xmath83 , and @xmath140 and @xmath141 are the effective bias and shot noise of the two principal components of the tracer density field , @xmath142 where the summation runs over all individual objects in the volume .",

    "the sampling of the density field with halos is less stochastic than poisson sampling ( sampling with points ) due their finite extension .",
    "since the exclusion volume of halos is proportional to their mass , this effect is strongest at the high mass end @xcite .",
    "the second principal component can be interpreted as a loop correction to the galaxy bias @xcite , coming from the second - order term in a local bias expansion model @xcite . due to its nonlinear character",
    ", it adds a super - poissonian shot noise contribution to the two - point clustering statistics of halos , originating from the squared density field @xcite .",

    "are simply obtained via cutting the halo catalog in two at different mass thresholds @xmath180 to yield the indicated abundances in each bin .",
    "the fourth selection utilizes the whole uniform halo catalog ( not weighted ) and its @xmath177-weighted form , while the last one uses both weighting functions @xmath181 to construct two tracers from one and the same halo catalog .",
    "further details about the tracers with these selection criteria can be found in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows @xmath182 for the different tracer pairs ; on large scales they all exhibit significant cancellation of sampling variance as compared to the reference case with switched real and imaginary parts ( dotted lines ) . towards smaller scales",
    "this effect is deteriorated due to the onset of nonlinearities and velocity dispersion ( finger - of - god effects ) @xcite . as evident from the plot , a combination of the uniform with the @xmath177-weighted halos yields the highest cancellation of sampling variance . however , the combination of @xmath179-weighted and @xmath177-weighted halos shows a comparable suppression , as opposed to cutting the halo catalog in two , which yields less cancellation , especially for a low mass cut .",
    "if a mass cut is imposed to construct two tracers , the highest sampling variance cancellation is achieved when the same abundance of objects in each of the resulting catalogs is chosen ( @xmath173 ) , which is in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "cancellation of sampling variance alone is not a sufficient indicator on how well cosmological parameters can be constrained in a multitracer analysis .",
    "this is because one is looking for relative changes in the clustering signal from multiple tracers , and not for the absolute clustering amplitude in each tracer . in this paragraph",
    "we will show that it is desirable to have tracers with a high relative galaxy bias ratio @xmath53 .",
    "quantitatively , the achievable accuracy on a given cosmological parameter @xmath183 is determined by the inversion of the fisher matrix of eq .",

    "we further distinguish between the following scenarios :    * single - tracer analysis with each of the two tracers taken separately , * multiple - tracer analysis with both tracers combined , * combined analysis of each tracer with the dark matter density field .",

    "it is more optimal to impose a high mass cut in order to benefit from the sub - poissonian shot noise level of the heaviest halos @xcite .",
    "however , the highest fisher information content is obtained when correlating the two orthogonally weighted fields @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the main reason for this is the large relative galaxy bias between the two fields and their relatively low shot noise level [ see table  [ tab1 ] and eq .",

    "more gains can be achieved when galaxies and ideal dark matter observations are combined , the improvement in the accuracy on @xmath49 compared to the ordinary single - tracer analysis amounts to about a factor of 10 in this case ( solid green line ) .",

    "while the constraints from the multitracer analysis on @xmath49 are only marginally affected for @xmath219 and degrade by roughly 2030% for @xmath218 , the combined analysis using optimally weighted halos and the dark matter is more severely deteriorated by mass scatter . here",
    ", even the optimistic scenario increases the uncertainty on the growth rate by roughly 50% , while the benefits from optimal weighting are completely lost when going to @xmath218 .    clearly , the high level of precision that can be obtained with this kind of experiment demands precise mass estimates .",
    "fortunately , a whole industry of existing and planned experiments devoted to cluster cosmology will provide those high quality data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .      in this section",
    "we want to investigate how our results depend on the resolution of the simulation ; respectively , the minimum resolved halo mass . in a real experiment , this corresponds to the depth of the galaxy survey with a corresponding luminosity threshold .",
    "because @xmath0-body simulations with a given volume become increasingly expensive with higher resolution , we will turn to theoretical predictions henceforth .",
    "the clustering properties of dark matter and halos can be neatly described by the _ halo model _",

    "increase towards lower @xmath225 due to the growing signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "a combination of galaxy and dark matter observations may increase these gains further , especially when the galaxies are weighted optimally . in this case",
    "there is no saturation towards lower @xmath225 and the improvement compared to the single - tracer analysis continues to grow .",
    "in contrast , the uniform galaxy overdensity field ( not weighted ) combined with dark matter already shows up a saturation at @xmath229 , so no more information on the growth rate can be gained when even more lighter halos are included in this kind of analysis .",
    "also note that the halo model predictions underestimate the improvements obtained when adding dark matter clustering information , as our @xmath0-body results with @xmath230 yield higher improvements ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "in the shot noise dominated regime above a minimum mass of @xmath231 the error ratio decreases again towards higher @xmath225 because the fisher information on @xmath17 from a single tracer here roughly scales as @xmath232 , while for a tracer combined with dark matter as @xmath233 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f_m1 ] ) , respectively ] .",
    "we refer the reader to figs .  10 and 11 of @xcite , where a similar plot is shown for the individual error bars on the non - gaussianity parameter @xmath234 .",
    "in this paper we investigated the benefits of using weights in a multitracer analysis of lss , with a particular focus on constraining the growth rate of structure formation . on the basis of earlier results on the clustering properties of dark matter halos and their stochasticity @xcite",
    ", we argue that the gains from a multitracer analysis in the sense of @xcite can be achieved by considering only the two principal components of the clustering signal - to - noise ratio @xmath88 ( or , equivalently , the two non - poisson eigenvectors of the shot noise matrix @xmath83 ) .",
    "we present their explicit functional forms in terms of weights , showing that the first one coincides with the weighting function explored in previous work @xcite , giving rise to low stochasticity and high bias . for the second one the weights are also mass dependent , but have a zero crossing , such that the overall bias is low .",
    "this yields a high relative galaxy bias @xmath53 between the two tracers , maximizing the fisher information content on the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "all of the other eigenvectors oscillate around zero and add very little information .",
    "the advantage of reducing the information to two eigenvectors is that all of the objects in a given catalog can be used to construct the two principal components , while in the conventional multitracer analysis the catalog has to be split into many lower number density subsamples with higher shot noise @xcite .    on the basis of numerical @xmath0-body simulations of dark matter halos ,",
    "we demonstrate that the constraints on @xmath49 and @xmath115 can be improved by up to a factor of 4 relative to a single - tracer method , but most of the improvement comes from large scales ( low @xmath31 ) , while for higher @xmath31 the gains are smaller and vanish above @xmath235 , where nonlinear effects introduce additional stochasticity between the two tracers .",
    "this technique is fairly insensitive to the observational uncertainty on the halo masses , as even a @xmath174 log - normal scatter does not degrade the improvements significantly .",
    "halo model considerations suggest even higher gains of the method with increasing mass resolution .",
    "one potential concern for our method is the possibility that galaxies might be bad tracers of their host - halo centers @xcite and therefore exhibit less pronounced principal components in the clustering signal - to - noise ratio that are distinct from poisson sampling .",
    "however , there are strong indications that certain types of galaxies do show strong correlations in both position and mass with their host halo , e.g. luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite",
    ". techniques to distinguish satellite galaxies from central galaxies have been developed and the satellite fraction can be used as an estimator of the host - halo mass @xcite .",
    "mock lrg catalogs obtained from a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) model suggest some reduction in stochasticity is possible even without explicit knowledge of halo masses  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an achievement of the presented gains seems feasible in light of upcoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as euclid  @xcite , which will attain galaxy number densities , host - halo mass ranges and a survey volume comparable to the simulations used in this paper  @xcite .    whether these gains translate into a useful constraint on the final cosmological parameters depends on our ability to model nonlinear rsd effects .",
    "we find nonlinear effects are important for @xmath49 already at @xmath236 , although they appear to be important for @xmath237 only at @xmath238 . in the most pessimistic case where the rsd model can not be trusted for @xmath236 ,",
    "the multitracer method provides major gains relative to the single - tracer case , but neither method provides very strong constraints overall because of the limited number of available fourier modes . in the case where we can use all the modes up to @xmath235 , the overall errors are considerably smaller and the multitracer method provides less of an advantage .",
    "it is clear that a better modeling of the nonlinear effects in rsd is needed to understand the ultimate reach of rsd in both single - tracer and multitracer methods .    in a more idealistic scenario ,",
    "we also consider the joint analysis of halos and the dark matter density field , which in principle is achievable via a combination of spectroscopic redshift surveys and weak lensing tomography . here , utilizing optimal weights can yield up to two orders of magnitude improvements in constraining @xmath49 as compared to a single - tracer analysis , but the method is more prone to uncertainties in the halo mass estimates . it is unlikely that this gain can be achieved in practice , since it is very difficult to measure dark matter clustering in the radial direction directly .",
    "a further technique to construct differently biased tracers of the density field makes use of nonlinear transformations @xcite .",
    "although it is difficult to describe the effects of a nonlinear transformation on both signal and noise in galaxy clustering data , combined with optimal weights this may provide another tool for the multitracer analysis .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on the information that can be extracted from rsd , in particular @xmath49 and @xmath115 , but our method is not limited to constraints on the growth rate , but may be applied to the analysis of primordial non - gaussianity @xcite , general relativistic corrections in large - scale clustering @xcite , the alcock - paczyski test @xcite or any other quantity that influences the effective bias of tracers of the density field .",
    "it is possible that a better model of nonlinear rsd may yield a more efficient multitracer method , where the gains relative to the single - tracer analysis described here on large scales can be extended to smaller scales .",
