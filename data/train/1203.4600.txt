    "in @xcite , szemerdi and trotter proved the following theorem :    [ szemereditrotterthm ] the number of incidences between @xmath0 points and @xmath1 lines in @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "theorem [ szemereditrotterthm ] has seen a number of generalizations , including the following one due to pach and sharir in @xcite :    [ pachsharirresult ] let @xmath13 be a collection of @xmath0 points in @xmath11 and @xmath14 a collection of @xmath1 curves with @xmath15 degrees of freedom",

    "thus we have the following corollary :    [ szemereditrotter2planes ] let @xmath48 be a collection of @xmath0 points and let @xmath14 be a collection of @xmath1 2planes in @xmath2 such that any two planes meet in at most one point",

    "furthermore , if @xmath13 is a collection of points then we can partition the collection of incidences between @xmath14 and @xmath13 into boundedly many classes @xmath69 such that each collection of incidences is 2admissible .",
    "see corollary 2.7 of @xcite for details .",
    "thus we have    let @xmath13 be a collection of @xmath0 points and let @xmath14 be a collection of @xmath1 ( complex ) unit circles in @xmath10 .",
    "then the number of incidences between points in @xmath13 and circles in @xmath14 is @xmath68    this result allows us to obtain an improved bound on the unit distance problem in @xmath10 :    let @xmath70 be a finite set of points , with @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath72      for simplicity , we shall only sketch the proof of theorem [ surfacesinr4thm ] , i.e.  the @xmath73 case , and we will concentrate on proving . furthermore , we shall assume that the surfaces in @xmath14 are 2planes .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "since each pair of points has at most two 2planes passing through both of them , we can use the cauchy - schwarz inequality to obtain a rudimentary bound on the cardinality of any collection of point - surface incidences .",
    "we will call this the cauchy - schwarz bound . using the discrete polynomial ham sandwich theorem",
    ", we find a polynomial @xmath74 of controlled degree whose zero set cuts @xmath2 into open `` cells , '' such that each cell contains roughly the same number of points from @xmath13 , and each surface from @xmath14 does not enter too many cells .",
    "we can then apply the cauchy - schwarz bound within each cell .",
    "this allows us to count the incidences occurring between surfaces and points in @xmath75 . in order to count the remaining incidences ,",
    "we perform a `` second level '' polynomial ham sandwich decomposition on the variety @xmath76 .",
    "this gives us a polynomial @xmath77 which cuts @xmath76 into a collection of 3dimensional cells , which are open in the relative ( euclidean ) topology of @xmath76 .",
    "we then apply the cauchy - schwarz bound to each of these 3dimensional cells .",
    "the only incidences left to count are those between surfaces in @xmath14 and points in @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath79    we can choose @xmath74 and @xmath77 in such a way that @xmath80 is a 2dimensional variety in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath26 be a surface in @xmath81 then @xmath26 will intersect @xmath80 in a union of isolated points ( proper intersections ) and 1dimensional curves ( non - proper intersections ) ( the case where @xmath26 meets @xmath80 in a 2dimensional variety can be dealt with easily ) .",
    "the number of isolated points in the intersection can be controlled by the degrees of the polynomials @xmath74 and @xmath77 ( we are working over @xmath82 where bzout s theorem need not hold , so we need to be a bit careful ) , and thus the number of incidences between points @xmath83 and surfaces @xmath30 such that @xmath84 is an isolated point of @xmath85 can be controlled .",
    "the only remaining task is to control the number of incidences between points of @xmath86 and 1dimensional curves arising from the intersection of @xmath80 and surfaces @xmath30 . to simplify the exposition ,",
    "pretend @xmath80 is a disjoint union of @xmath87 2planes , i.e.  @xmath88 ( of course , we will not make this assumption when we prove the actual result ) .",
    "then for each plane @xmath89 @xmath90 is a line on @xmath91 .",
    "it remains to count the number of incidences between @xmath92 and @xmath93 the szemerdi - trotter theorem for lines in @xmath11 would give us the bound @xmath94 but if we sum over the @xmath87 values of @xmath95 , we have only bounded the number of incidences by @xmath96 since @xmath87 can be quite large , this is not sufficient . instead ,",
    "recall szkely s proof in @xcite of the szemerdi - trotter theorem , which uses the crossing number inequality ( the crossing number inequality and all other graph - related quantities are defined in section [ graphtheorysection ] below ) . loosely speaking",
    ", we consider the graph drawing @xmath97 on @xmath91 whose vertices are the points of @xmath92 , and two vertices are connected by an edge if there is a line segment from @xmath98 passing through the two points .",
    "then the number of edges of the graph is comparable to the number of incidences between points and lines , and this is controlled by @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the number of edge crossings and @xmath101 is the number of vertices of @xmath97 .",
    "thus in place of , we have @xmath102 the key insight is that @xmath103 indeed , every pair of 2planes @xmath104 can intersect in at most one point , and since we assumed the planes @xmath105 composing @xmath80 were disjoint , the intersection point of @xmath106 can occur on @xmath91 for at most one index @xmath95 .",
    "summing over all choices of @xmath95 , applying hlder s inequality , and inserting , we obtain the correct bound on the number of incidences between surfaces in @xmath14 and points lying on @xmath80 .",
    "unfortunately , the assumption that @xmath80 is a disjoint union of 2planes need not be true .",
    "thus we must cut @xmath80 up into pieces , each of which behaves like a 2plane , and we need to prove a more general form of the szemerdi - trotter theorem for families of curves and points that lie on suitable domains .",
    "this is a purely topological argument , and it is done using the crossing number inequality .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath80 into suitable domains relies on results from real algebraic geometry , and it works well provided @xmath80 is not of too high degree .",
    "the degree of @xmath80 depends on the value of @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath108 is too large compared to @xmath109 , the degree of @xmath80 is too big , and we can not cut @xmath80 into suitable pieces without introducing error terms that are larger than the bounds we are trying to prove .",
    "thus , instead of choosing `` optimal '' values for the degrees of @xmath74 and @xmath77 , we choose smaller values so that the degree of @xmath80 is not too big .",
    "we can no longer apply the cauchy - schwarz bound to control the incidences occurring within each of the 3 and 4dimensional cells described above .",
    "instead , we borrow an idea from solymosi and tao in @xcite , and we assume an appropriate bound on the number of incidences between collections of points @xmath110 and surfaces @xmath111 provided @xmath112 and @xmath113 have a better ratio of sizes than @xmath108 and @xmath109 . based on the way the cell decomposition works , this induction assumption will be satisfied for the collection of points and surfaces inside each cell of the decomposition , provided that @xmath114 for some constant @xmath5 , where the improvement obtained by the induction step depends on @xmath6 .",
    "after finitely many applications of the induction step , we obtain a situation where the ratio of @xmath108 and @xmath109 is very favorable , and thus our decomposition of @xmath80 into `` 2plane - like pieces '' is very good . at this point , we can select @xmath74 and @xmath77 to have optimal degrees and use the arguments above where we apply the cauchy - schwarz bound within each cell rather than the induction hypothesis .",
    "the proof of is similar , except we never apply the cauchy - schwarz bound ; we keep applying the induction hypothesis bounds until our cells are so small that we can use a trivial bound to control the number of incidences that occur with each cell .",
    "this is similar to the techniques used by solymosi and tao .",
    "however , solymosi and tao need to iterate their induction step roughly @xmath115 times , while with our techniques we only need to perform the induction step about @xmath116 times .",
    "this allows us to get a slightly sharper bound . in order to prove theorem [ surfacesinr4thm]@xmath117",
    ", we use the more intricate crossing - number based arguments of pach and sharir from @xcite in place of szkely s proof of the szemerdi - trotter theorem .",

    "an earlier result similar to lemma [ stforlinesonhomeo]@xmath117 was proved by pach and sharir in @xcite . there , the authors required that the curves in @xmath125 be algebraic curves defined by @xmath15 real parameters , i.e.  there is an assignment from these @xmath15 parameters to the curves such that any choice of parameters defines at most a constant number of curves , and the dependence of the curves on the parameters is algebraic of low degree .",
