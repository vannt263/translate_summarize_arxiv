    "the aim of this paper is to present an intriguing construction of hyperkhler structures .    in (",
    "* theorem 10 ) we exhibited a global rigidity of @xmath0-dimensional hyperkhler metrics : if such a metric @xmath2 admits a homothetic vector field with a compact transversal , then @xmath2 is flat .",
    "we proved this by an argument involving the integral formula for the signature of a compact @xmath0-manifold , applied to a quotient of a neighbourhood of the transversal . that line of reasoning obviously suggests the question whether the compactness hypothesis can be weakened to a completeness condition .    in the present paper",
    "we define the natural notion of completeness for a riemannian metric with a homothety ( slice - completeness ) and give a construction leading to non - flat , slice - complete hyperkhler structures . in section  [ section : gh ]",
    "we discuss a homogeneous gibbons  hawking ansatz , which forms the basis for our construction . in section  [ section : canonical ] we derive explicit formul  for various metrics that arise in this construction .",
    "the main part of the construction of our examples is contained in section  [ section : example ] . in view of a related _ incompleteness _",
    "result from  @xcite , see theorem  [ thm : incomplete ] below , it was to be expected ( and is confirmed here ) that the construction of such slice - complete examples would be quite delicate .",
    "so it is all the more surprising that our construction actually yields an infinite - dimensional family of isometry classes of such structures ( section  [ section : many ] ) . in section  [",
    "section : non - flat ] it is shown that our construction does indeed give rise to _ non - flat _ hyperkhler metrics . in section  [ section :",
    "cc ] we relate our construction to the theory of taut contact spheres developed in  @xcite ; this relation originally motivated the search for the hyperkhler metrics described here . in that context",
    "we describe another surprising phenomenon , namely , examples of incomplete riemannian metrics giving rise to complete carnot  carathodory distances .",
    "the gibbons  hawking ansatz  @xcite allows one to construct hyperkhler metrics with an @xmath3-invariance .",
    "we want to study metrics arising from this ansatz , subject to an additional homogeneity property amounting to the existence of a homothetic vector field .",
    "a vector field @xmath4 is * homothetic * for the riemannian metric @xmath2 if it satisfies @xmath5 .",
    "the * canonical slice * corresponding to such a vector field is the subset defined by the equation @xmath6 .",
    "the canonical slice is a hypersurface transverse to @xmath4 and , if the flow of @xmath4 is complete , it intersects each orbit exactly once . for a cone metric @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the canonical slice is the hypersurface @xmath9 orthogonal to @xmath4 .",
    "most homothetic fields , however , are not orthogonal to any hypersurface ; in such situations our definition still gives a natural choice of transversal .",
    "a riemannian metric on a product @xmath10 with translation along the @xmath11-factor as homotheties is necessarily incomplete in the @xmath11-direction : proper paths of the form @xmath12\\subset",
    "m\\times{{\\mathbb r}}$ ] have finite length in such a metric .",
    "therefore , the best one can aim for is completeness in the transverse directions .",
    "a riemannian metric on a product @xmath10 with translation along the @xmath11-factor as homotheties is * slice - complete * if the canonical slice is complete in the induced metric .    for the construction of our examples",
    ", we shall be working on a @xmath0-manifold @xmath13 of the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 an open surface ; the subscripts denote the respective coordinates . we look for hyperkhler structures @xmath16 with the following properties :    * the flow of @xmath17 preserves the metric @xmath2 , and @xmath18 is a hamiltonian vector field for each of the symplectic forms  @xmath19 . *",
    "the vector field @xmath20 satisfies @xmath21 , @xmath22 , hence also @xmath23 .",
    "notice that this is stronger than just being homothetic .    the partial differential equations for a hyperkhler structure linearise under condition  ( i ) to the @xmath1-dimensional laplace equation . under the additional condition ( ii )",
    ", one can reduce these equations further to the cauchy ",
    "riemann equations in real dimension  2 .",
    "we next expand on these two claims .",

    ", one selects hamiltonian functions @xmath26 such that @xmath27 .",
    "then there exist a unique @xmath28-form @xmath29 and a unique positive function @xmath30 giving the following expressions for the symplectic forms @xmath31 , where @xmath32 runs over the cyclic permutations of @xmath33 : @xmath34 and the following one for the hyperkhler metric : @xmath35 here the forms @xmath36 are a basis for the annihilator of @xmath17 , and so @xmath37 are ( at least locally ) coordinates for the orbit space of @xmath17 .",
    "the function @xmath30 satisfies @xmath38 and is thus locally a function of only @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath28-form @xmath29 annihilates @xmath17 and is invariant under its flow , so it is locally pulled back from the orbit space of  @xmath17 .",
    "all this means that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are locally objects on @xmath37-space , and we shall treat them as such for the purpose of local calculations .    the projection onto the orbit space of @xmath17 is a riemannian submersion from the metric @xmath39 to the euclidean metric @xmath40 .",
    "the condition for ( [ eqn : gh - forms ] ) to define a triple of closed @xmath41-forms is then @xmath42 where the hodge star operator is in terms of that euclidean metric and the orientation defined by @xmath43 .",
    "for the ( local ) existence of @xmath29 it is necessary and sufficient that @xmath30 be harmonic with respect to the euclidean metric .",
    "we call @xmath30 the * gibbons  hawking potential*.    the systematic construction of a hyperkhler structure on @xmath25 proceeds as follows",

    "one may regard @xmath51 as a _ non - schlicht _ domain in @xmath47 , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 as multiple - valued objects in @xmath47 .",
    "on @xmath24 , however , they are perfectly well defined , and so equation  ( [ eqn : curl ] ) can be read as an identity on  @xmath24 .    we now restrict our attention to @xmath1-manifolds @xmath24 of the form @xmath52 with @xmath15 an open surface , and impose both conditions ( i ) and  ( ii ) .",
    "the following definition is useful for describing the special features of this case .    a tensorial object * o * ( on @xmath53 or on  @xmath24 ) is called * homogeneous of degree @xmath54 * if @xmath55 .",
    "condition ( ii ) requires that @xmath2 and the symplectic forms be homogeneous of degree  @xmath28 . since @xmath17 is invariant under the flow of @xmath20",
    ", the potential @xmath56 must be homogeneous of degree  @xmath57 .",
    "condition ( ii ) provides a convenient choice for the hamiltonian functions  @xmath58 , because one easily checks that @xmath59 satisfies @xmath27 in this case .",
    "this choice has the virtue that the @xmath58 are homogeneous of degree  @xmath28 , i.e.that @xmath60 .",
    "we call @xmath61 the * momentum map*. then the equations @xmath60 say that @xmath20 is @xmath48-related to the position vector field on  @xmath47 .",
    "the uniqueness of @xmath29 for given hamiltonian functions @xmath58 implies that in the present situation both @xmath29 and the function @xmath62 are homogeneous of degree  @xmath63 .",
    "consider now the function @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath28-form @xmath65 is homogeneous of degree  @xmath63 and satisfies @xmath66 .",
    "hence @xmath67 where the @xmath28-form @xmath68 is homogeneous of degree @xmath63 ( i.e.@xmath20-invariant ) , @xmath18-invariant , and it annihilates both @xmath20 and  @xmath18 .",

    "we endow the unit sphere @xmath72 with the metric induced from the standard metric on @xmath47 , and with the orientation as boundary of the @xmath1-ball .",

    "let @xmath82 be a local holomorphic coordinate on @xmath72 , and let @xmath83 be its pullback under @xmath76",
    ". then @xmath84 are homogeneous of degree @xmath63 and @xmath85 are local coordinates on @xmath78 giving the same orientation as @xmath37 .    since @xmath30 is homogeneous of degree  @xmath57 , we have @xmath86 , therefore @xmath87",
    "on the other hand , @xmath88 and so @xmath89 since @xmath68 is homogeneous of degree  @xmath63 and annihilates @xmath20 , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 then ( [ eqn : curl ] ) is seen to be equivalent to the system @xmath92 the last two equations are the cauchy  riemann equations for  @xmath93 .    in order to describe the systematic construction of hyperkhler structures satisfying ( i ) and ( ii ) , it is convenient to fix the complex structure @xmath75 on @xmath15 in advance .",
    "we then use _ holomorphic data _ of the following kind to construct the desired structures :    * a local biholomorphism @xmath94 , * a holomorphic function @xmath95 with values in the upper half - plane  @xmath96 .",
    "being homogeneous of degree  @xmath28 , the function @xmath97 must be of the form @xmath98 with @xmath99 the pullback of a positive function on  @xmath15 . given a choice of @xmath100 , the construction is as follows .",

    "this implies that if @xmath15 is simply - connected , then the triple @xmath109 is determined up to isomorphism by the holomorphic data @xmath110 alone , thus allowing us to make any choice for @xmath99 and  @xmath68 . for general @xmath15 , the choice of @xmath68 matters , but the function @xmath99 can always be chosen freely . we shall presently establish a convenient choice for  @xmath99",
    "we continue to consider structures satisfying ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "recall that the canonical slice is the hypersurface @xmath111 the vector field @xmath18 is a killing field for @xmath2 and commutes with  @xmath20 .",
    "so @xmath18 is tangent to  @xmath112 , and the restriction of @xmath18 to @xmath112 is a killing field for the @xmath1-dimensional metric @xmath113 induced on @xmath112 by the hyperkhler metric . that metric  @xmath113 , in turn , induces the quotient metric on @xmath114 which makes the projection a riemannian submersion .",

    "the restriction of the hyperkhler metric to this complement is then the same as the restriction of the quadratic form @xmath135 .",
    "this @xmath136 is @xmath18-invariant and has @xmath17 as an isotropic direction , therefore its restriction to the canonical slice @xmath112 is the pullback of the quotient metric under the quotient projection .",
    "the standard metric of @xmath47 equals @xmath137 in spherical coordinates .",
    "this and the equations @xmath138 and @xmath139 from lemma  [ lem : slice ] imply that the restriction of @xmath136 to @xmath112 is given by the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : g - sigma ] ) , with @xmath71 replaced by  @xmath140 .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath131 pulls @xmath141 given by ( [ eqn : g - sigma ] ) back to the quotient metric .",
