    "deep imaging in the submillimeter opened a new window for studying high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the brighter submillimeter galaxies ( smgs , typical total infrared luminosity greater than @xmath13 ) that have radio counterparts were found to be at redshifts mostly between 2 and 3 @xcite . despite the extremely large star formation rates ( sfrs ) , typically @xmath14",
    "@xmath10 yr@xmath11 , such galaxies do not emit strongly in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) and therefore are generally not lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( a counter example is a @xmath15 smg in @xcite , which was originally selected as an lbg . )",
    "this implies a large fraction of dusty star formation at high redshift being missed by rest - frame uv surveys .",
    "this raises two general questions : will we start to see galaxies similar to optically selected ones if we are able to probe deeper in the submillimeter , and exactly how much high - redshift star formation is missed by optical surveys ?",
    "we are not close to being able to answer either question .",
    "deep submillimeter surveys in lensing clusters are able to probe dusty galaxies with ir luminosities @xmath16 and constrain their number density @xcite , but the identification of their optical counterparts is not yet complete , and the sample sizes are very small . furthermore , a @xmath17 smg , goods 850 - 5 , was recently found to be extremely faint in the optical and near - infrared ( nir ) at @xmath18  @xmath8 m @xcite .",
    "if a significant fraction of the @xmath12 smgs in the ir luminosity range @xmath19@xmath20 @xmath21 are like goods 850 - 5 , then identifying them in the radio and optical will be challenging even with next - generation instruments .",
    "we therefore seek a nir diagnosis of extremely optically faint smgs . a general description of the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) colors of bright smgs was recently developed by @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the reddest galaxies in the irac and @xmath0 bands .",
    "in this paper we present a new color selection of extremely red objects ( eros ) with @xmath0 and irac colors of @xmath22  @xmath8 m @xmath23 .",
    "we refer to such sources as kieros .",
    "this selection is motivated by the fact that at least half of known smgs are redder than this color ( section  [ sec_data ] ) . among all existing ero selections ,",
    "the kiero selection utilizes the longest wavebands that are practically accessible for deep imaging . unlike some other selections for high - redshift red objects ,",
    "the kiero selection does not particularly aim at the 4000    balmer breaks in galactic spectra , which only enter the @xmath0 band at @xmath24 .",
    "instead , this selection aims at galaxies at @xmath12 whose extremely red colors are likely caused by large dust extinction ( section  [ sec_redshift ] ) . also because of this , we choose the 4.5 @xmath8 m band instead of the 3.6 @xmath8 m band , to be more sensitive to galaxies whose spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are red over a broad wavelength range ( cf .",
    "sharp spectral breaks ) .",
    "the paper is organized as following .",
    "we describe the data and the kiero selection in section  [ sec_data ] , the number counts in section  [ sec_density ] , the optical and nir seds , redshift distribution , and stellar populations in section  [ sec_redshift ] , and the radio , millimeter , submillimeter , and x - ray properties in section  [ sec_prop ] .",
    "we identify active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in kieros in section  [ sec_agn ] .",
    "we estimate the sfrs and sfr densities ( sfrds ) of kieros in section  [ sec_sfr ] .",
    "we compare kieros with other high - redshift galaxy populations in section  [ sec_overlap ] .",
    "we discuss the roles of kieros in galaxy formation in section  [ sec_discuss ] and summarize our results in section  [ summary ] . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume cosmological parameters of @xmath25 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab system , where an ab magnitude is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "we use our publicly released @xmath0 and irac catalogs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter w10 ) of the great observatories origins deep surveys - north ( goods - n ; @xcite ) field . the @xmath0 source catalog of w10 is extracted from an extremely deep canada - france - hawaii telescope @xmath0 image , which has a @xmath29 depth of 0.12 @xmath8jy in the goods - n region .",
    "w10 used the goods - n _ spitzer _ irac images at 3.68.0  @xmath8 m ( m.  dickinson et al .  2011 , in preparation ) to measure the irac photometry of the @xmath0 selected sources using a clean - like method that takes the @xmath0 catalog and image as priors .",
    "primary @xmath0 and irac catalog contains 15018 @xmath0 selected sources that are detected at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath8 m in the goods - n region .",
    "w10 s secondary catalog contains 358 @xmath0-faint irac detected sources .",
    "we show the @xmath0 , 3.6  @xmath8 m , and 4.5  @xmath8 m color  color diagram for sources with @xmath30 4.5  @xmath8 m fluxes in w10 s primary catalog in figure  [ fig_color_color ] . to obtain colors of goods - n smgs",
    ", we looked for @xmath0 and irac counterparts of the smgs in the 4 @xmath31 scuba sample of @xcite and aztec sample of @xcite .",
    "we only include smgs with unambiguous radio interferometric identifications ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ; @xcite ) or submillimeter interferometric identifications ( @xcite ; a.  j.  barger et al .  2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "there are 28 such smgs and they are shown with squares in figure  [ fig_color_color ] .",
    "fourteen of them are redder than @xmath32 ( horizontal line in the figure ) and three are not even detected in @xmath0 ( lower limits in the figure ) .",
    "they occupy a color space significantly different than that of most sources detected at both @xmath0 and 4.5  @xmath8 m . because most spectroscopically identified smgs are at @xmath33 @xcite , the extremely red colors of these smgs must be caused by very high redshifts and/or extremely large dust extinctions ( see section 4 ) , like in the case of goods 850 - 5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such extremely red smgs are of particular interest . since it is known that a variety of optical / nir criteria are required to include all bright smgs @xcite , here we only focus on selecting and understanding the extremely red ones .    in order to find sources similar to the extremely red smgs but slightly fainter in the submillimeter and therefore undetected by current submillimeter surveys , we select kieros with @xmath22  @xmath8 m @xmath23 .",
    "we require that the sources be detected at @xmath30 in the 4.5  @xmath8 m band and in at least one other irac band . for galaxies detected in the irac bands but not in the @xmath0 band ( in w10 s secondary catalog )",
    ", we adopt their @xmath29 @xmath0 limits .",
    "although w10 s primary catalog is a @xmath0 selected one , the above inclusion of @xmath0-faint 4.5  @xmath8 m sources in w10 s secondary catalog makes the selection of kieros in principle a 4.5  @xmath8 m selection .",
    "we visually inspected the irac images of all such galaxies and excluded those whose irac fluxes are less reliable , mainly galaxies affected by very bright stars in the field and galaxies blended with @xmath34 bright nearby galaxies .",
    "these are the limitations of w10 s catalogs ( see w10 for discussion ) .",
    "this reduces the number of selected kieros by @xmath35 and should not impact our analyses , even if some of them are truly red sources .",
    "we are left with 104 kieros in the main @xmath0-selected sample and 92 in the @xmath0 undetected sample . among the above",
    "mentioned 28 identified smgs in the goods - n , 14 are kieros .",
    "figure  [ fig_color_mag ] shows a @xmath0 and 4.5  @xmath8 m color  magnitude diagram for kieros and field galaxies .",
    "the kieros are a relatively rare population among all sources detected at 4.5  @xmath8 m , and the selection of kieros lies very close to the detection limits at both @xmath0 and 4.5  @xmath8 m . at @xmath0 ,",
    "w10 provided a description of the completeness limits ( e.g. , the @xmath0 30% limit shown by the diagonal dashed line in figure  [ fig_color_mag ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "it is nontrivial to quantify the completeness at 4.5  @xmath8 m , which depends on both the @xmath0 completeness and the very complex procedures used by w10 to construct the 4.5  @xmath8 m source lists .",
    "because of the above issues , we have decided to present the @xmath0 number counts of kieros ( figure  [ fig_density ] ) , even though this is a 4.5  @xmath8 m selected population . in our survey there are no kieros brighter than 6 @xmath8jy at @xmath0 .",
    "the raw counts slightly flatten at @xmath36 @xmath8jy and drop rapidly below 0.3 @xmath8jy , consistent with the @xmath0 detection completeness . without considering the completeness at 4.5  @xmath8 m , simply correcting the counts with the @xmath0 completeness derived by w10",
    "suggests that the slope of the counts does not change significantly down to a flux level of @xmath37 @xmath8jy .",
    "a slope of @xmath38 in the logn - mag space was fitted at @xmath39 @xmath8jy using completeness corrected counts weighted by the poisson errors . comparing to the slope for the entire @xmath0 sample in the same flux range ( @xmath40 , e.g. , @xcite ) , this is much steeper .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the higher redshifts of kieros ( see next section ) .",
    "furthermore , the large number of @xmath0-undetected sources that meet our kiero selection criterion ( dashed histogram in figure  [ fig_density ] ) suggests that the counts may be still rising at a @xmath0 flux of @xmath40 @xmath8jy .",
    "to obtain a rough idea about the seds and redshifts of kieros , we plot the color  redshift diagram of spectroscopically identified 4.5  @xmath8 m sources in figure  [ fig_z_color ] .",
    "most 4.5  @xmath8 m sources have @xmath22  @xmath8 m colors bluer than 1.0 .",
    "even agns , which tend to have unusual colors , are mostly bluer than 1.0 . in general , we only expect heavily extinguished ( @xmath41 ) galaxies at @xmath12 to be redder than 1.6 . at @xmath42 , galaxies can be redder than 1.6 in only the most extreme cases .",
    "we do not expect to see many such galaxies . to verify that kieros are mostly at @xmath12",
    ", we looked at the spectroscopic redshifts of goods - n galaxies and carried out a photometric redshift analysis .      in the entire kiero sample ,",
    "only two sources are bright enough in the optical and nir to have spectroscopic redshifts in our redshift survey @xcite .",
    "both are detected in the 2 ms _ chandra _ image ( source numbers 109 and 135 in the catalog of @xcite ) .",
    "one is the smg goods 850 - 7 ( @xmath43 @xmath8jy , @xmath44 mjy ) at @xmath45 .",
    "the other is a @xmath46 @xmath8jy radio source at @xmath47 .",
    "this radio source is very close to the bright smg goods 850 - 2 ( @xmath48 mjy ) , with an angular separation of @xmath49 based on its scuba position ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ; see also @xcite ) . however , our recent submillimeter interferometric observation ( a.  j.  barger et al .",
    ", in preparation ) shows that goods 850 - 2 is another faint @xmath0-band source that also enters our kiero sample .",
    "in addition to the two optical spectroscopic redshifts , an smg kiero , goods 850 - 5 @xcite , has a plausible millimeter spectroscopic redshift of 4.042 based on a line detection at 91.4 ghz that is likely a co(43 ) transition @xcite .",
    "the three spectroscopic redshifts span a redshift range that agrees with what would be expected based on figure  [ fig_z_color ] .",
    "however , the sample size is too small and we need to rely on photometric redshift fitting .",
    "we carried out a photometric redshift analysis on a subsample of 76 high s / n kieros whose @xmath50 fluxes are greater than 0.2 @xmath8jy .",
    "we included the photometry in the @xmath51 , _ hst _ acs , @xmath52 , wfc3 f140w , @xmath0 , and irac bands .",
    "we adopted the @xmath51-band fluxes from @xcite .",
    "for the acs bands , we directly adopted the fluxes from the goods - n v2 catalog @xcite .",
    "we measured @xmath52-band fluxes from a cfht wircam image that contains @xmath53 hr of total integration .",
    "we obtained the @xmath52-band images from the public archive .",
    "they were originally obtained by a taiwanese team led by lihwai lin ( 2010 , in preparation ) .",
    "we reduced and processed the @xmath52-band images in an identical manner to w10 for the @xmath0-band images .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "wfc3 f140w data will be described by a. barger et al .",
    "( 2011 , in prep ) .    for photometric redshift fitting , we tried two packages : the latest version of hyperz @xcite , and eazy @xcite .",
    "we found that eazy generally produces better results and includes a necessary feature for our studies ( see below ) .",
    "our primary photometric redshift results in this paper are thus based on eazy .",
    "we adopted the default set of sed templates of @xcite , provided in the eazy package .",
    "this set includes five templates ranging from very blue and young galaxies with strong emission lines , to galaxies dominated by old stars .",
    "we included an additional smg - type dusty starburst model ( @xmath54 myr , @xmath55 ) , also provided in the eazy package .",
    "we refer to brammer et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for detailed descriptions on all these sed models .",
    "the templates here all already include certain amounts of extinction in order to fit galaxy seds in deep surveys . to account for very dusty sources in the kiero sample , we further reddened these templates ( including the already reddened smg template ) by @xmath56 , 0.5 , and 1.0 with the extinction law of @xcite . to account for the situation where there are more than two distinct stellar populations in a galaxy",
    ", we allowed for all linear combinations of the templates in the fitting . in section  [ sec_stellar ] we will show that the eazy feature of allowing for all linear combinations of templates is essential . because a fitted sed is a combination of multiple templates , we are not able to quote an extinction value for a source . in figure  [ fig_photoz](a )",
    "we show the distribution of the eazy photometric redshifts .    in order to see how reliable the fitting is , we ran eazy on @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath8jy galaxies in the spectroscopic sample of barger et al .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig_photoz_compare ] .",
    "if we define @xmath59 as @xmath60 , then only 5.3% of the galaxies have @xmath61 . after excluding these outliers ,",
    "there is an rms dispersion of 0.05 and a median systematic offset of -0.01 in @xmath59 .",
    "we also made the same comparison on hyperz results .",
    "the outlier fraction and dispersion in @xmath59 are both significantly worse than the eazy ones .",
    "although the results in figure  [ fig_photoz_compare ] look good , there is no guarantee that we can achieve the same on kieros .",
    "the two kieros with spectroscopic redshifts at @xmath45 and 1.790 have eazy photometric redshifts of 2.03 and 1.96 , respectively ( large squares in figure  [ fig_photoz_compare ] ) .",
    "these are excellent , but the sample is too small for us to comment on the overall quality . we can also compare the photometric redshifts on kieros that show continuum dropouts ( lyman breaks , see also section  [ sec_lbg ] ) .",
    "there are 15 @xmath62-dropouts in the kiero sample , 6 of which are bright enough at @xmath0 to have photometric redshifts .",
    "their mean photometric redshift is @xmath63 .",
    "there are 4 @xmath64-dropouts in the kiero sample , 2 of which have photometric redshifts of 5.02 and 4.71 .",
    "these are all consistent with the expected redshifts for the dropouts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , figure  [ fig_sed ] shows that the majority of the fitted seds reasonably represent the observed seds , including various spectral breaks ( the lyman breaks , balmer breaks , and 1.6 @xmath8 m bumps ) , except agns ( section  [ sec_agn ] ) with featureless power - law seds in the irac bands .",
    "it is worth noting that there are three non - agn data points at @xmath65 with unusually large stellar masses ( section [ sec_stellar ] ) of @xmath66 .",
    "they are # 23 , 24 , and 38 in figure  [ fig_sed ] .",
    "their observed seds are also quite featureless in the irac bands , and all fade dramatically at @xmath0 and shorter wavebands , likely because of extinction .",
    "although they are not identified as agns , we suspect that their photometric fittings are unreliable . except for agns and these few problematic cases ,",
    "the eazy photometric redshifts for the majority of the sources seem reasonably good . in section  [ sec_submm ] we present independent evidence suggesting that the redshift distribution in figure  [ fig_photoz](a ) is approximately correct .",
    "we did not attempt to study the redshifts of fainter sources ( @xmath67 @xmath8jy ) .",
    "such sources often have robust photometry in only two irac bands , which is insufficient for good photometric redshifts .",
    "one might expect that these fainter sources should have higher redshifts rather than lower intrinsic luminosities .",
    "however , we can not test this with the current data .",
    "when testing the photometric redshift fitting , we found that many kieros have seds that can not be fitted with a single stellar population by hyperz .",
    "for example , on the above mentioned six @xmath62-dropouts , hyperz returns a mean redshift of @xmath68 .",
    "this is clearly too low , a consequence of trying to fit the complex seds with single stellar populations .",
    "this is a key reason for our adoption of eazy , which allows for combinations of different sed templates .",
    "the most obvious cases of such kieros are sources 3 , 11 , 30 , 35 , 41 , 53 , and 70 in figure  [ fig_sed ] . in such kieros , there are well - evolved old stellar populations , which produce the observed nir luminosity , as well as unobscured ongoing star formation , which produces the strong rest - frame uv emission .",
    "this property is similar to that of objects selected with @xmath69 ( ieros ) by @xcite in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , our stacking analyses in the radio and fir ( section  [ sec_prop ] and table  [ tab_stack ] ) show that sources that are faint in the rest - frame uv have more intensive starbursts .",
    "sfr estimates based on rest - frame uv may miss the strong dust - hidden star formation on such optically faint sources .",
    "another interesting question to ask is whether or not kieros are massive galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , eazy does not provide direct estimates of stellar masses . to do this , we rely on hyperz , which builds in the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite and provides stellar mass estimates .",
    "we forced hyperz to fit at the eazy redshifts .",
    "we derived two sets of stellar masses by fitting to the full seds of the kieros , and by fitting to just the infrared seds in the @xmath52 and redder bands .",
    "we found that neither of the two masses systematically favor high or low mass values . for roughly 2/3 of the objects , these two masses agree within 0.4 dex .",
    "we thus believe that for most of the objects , the derived masses are robust . on the other hand , since many of the kieros show two different stellar populations , it is better to just fit the rest - frame nir parts of the seds .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios in the nir are relatively insensitive to both extinction and ongoing star formation . nevertheless , we remind the reader that our mass estimates are significantly limited by the fact that hyperz can only fit the seds with single stellar populations .    in figure  [ fig_photoz](b )",
    "we show the best fit stellar masses ( squares ) and the maximum and minimum masses ( vertical bars ) from the various templates of @xcite , based on just fitting the infrared seds . for most kieros ,",
    "the data only allow small ranges of stellar masses , a consequence of similar mass - to - light ratios in the nir .",
    "they have large stellar masses of @xmath70 to @xmath71 .",
    "some of the masses seem unusually large , especially at the high - redshift end ( @xmath65 ) where less photometric data points are available and there is a degeneracy between photometric redshift , age , and extinction .",
    "this is a fundamental limit of the current data .",
    "we also note that there are 18 sources with stellar masses less than @xmath70 , giving a mass distribution that is somewhat disjoint from that of the other kieros .",
    "these are all optically bright sources with @xmath72 @xmath8jy and have lower redshifts .",
    "they are likely a less dusty subclass of kieros .    in summary , the majority of kieros in the photometric redshift subsample are more massive than @xmath70 .",
    "in addition to the massive stellar populations , a large fraction of kieros show young stellar populations in the rest - frame uv . in the following sections of this paper",
    ", we will focus on the star formation properties of kieros .",
    "in order to understand the star formation activities in kieros ( albeit with agn contamination ) , we studied their radio properties .",
    "we used the very large array ( vla ) 1.4 ghz image and catalog in the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) published by @xcite .",
    "the image has a 5 @xmath31 sensitivity of 20 @xmath8jy at the field center , and the catalog contains @xmath73 sources in the goods - n region . among the 196 kieros , 22",
    "are included in the catalog of @xcite .    for sources not in the catalog of @xcite , we measured their fluxes from the image with @xmath74 apertures after correcting for the vla primary beam and the band - width smearing .",
    "we compared our fluxes on compact sources with those in the catalog of @xcite , and they are fully consistent with each other .",
    "the adopted aperture size is @xmath75 the vla beam fwhm and corresponds to 2025 kpc at @xmath765 .",
    "this size is slightly less optimized for detecting faint and compact sources , but it encloses most of the radio flux if the radio - emitting region in a high - redshift galaxy is offset from the position determined by nir observations by a few kpc .",
    "such offsets are not uncommon in nearby interacting / merging systems .",
    "the measured 1.4 ghz fluxes of the kieros are shown in the bottom and middle panels of figure  [ fig_radio_irac2 ] .",
    "we can study the mean 1.4  ghz fluxes of kieros via a `` stacking analysis , '' in which we measure radio fluxes with @xmath74 apertures at the locations of kieros and average the results .",
    "first , we need to understand the bias and uncertainty in such stacked fluxes , for which we took a monte carlo approach .",
    "we randomly placed @xmath74 apertures in the vla image , calculated their mean flux , and repeated a large number of such measurements .",
    "the mean flux measured in this way is an estimate of contamination from physically unrelated nearby sources .",
    "we refer to this as confusion .",
    "we excluded flux values greater than 600 @xmath8jy to avoid being biased by the very bright source , which is likely an agn ( also see section  [ sec_x ] ) . in the irac region ,",
    "the mean 1.4  ghz flux is 0.41 @xmath8jy for the random positions in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "we subtracted this value from the mean flux of each kiero sample .",
    "we treated the dispersion between various measurements of the mean flux of random apertures as noise in the mean , which has contributions from the receiver noise and from the confusion noise .",
    "we varied the number of random apertures that we placed in the image each time , and we found that even with source densities up to @xmath77 deg@xmath78 , the measured noise in the mean precisely scales with the square - root of the source number . in the irac region ,",
    "such noise is 8.7 @xmath8jy per source .",
    "this value is larger than the nominal 4 @xmath8jy noise of the image , a consequence of confusion caused by bright sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the average fluxes we determine are considerably below the conventional single - source detection limit .",
    "we present our major stacking analysis results in table  [ tab_stack ] .",
    "for the entire sample of 196 kieros , excluding the @xmath79 @xmath8jy one , the mean 1.4  ghz flux is @xmath80 @xmath8jy , and the median is 3.07 @xmath8jy . for comparison , in the 4.5  @xmath8 m sample there are 8977 sources with @xmath81 @xmath8jy .",

    "however , the 80 @xmath8jy flux limit used in the dr1 + catalog is shallower than the true depth of the image . to search for fainter mips detected kieros , we first made a deep source extraction in the mips image with sextractor @xcite .",

    "we removed such kieros unless their are clearly associated with local 24 @xmath8 m peaks .",
    "the above procedure increases the number of mips detected kieros to 27 .",

    "multiple broad pah emission and silicate absorption features enter the mips 24  @xmath8 m band , producing both positive and negative selection biases that are strong functions of redshift .",
    "these strongly affect the observed 24  @xmath8 m fluxes of kieros , since they are all at @xmath208 . because of this , using 24  @xmath8 m fluxes to quantify the star formation activity in kieros is highly uncertain ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and strongly depends on the assumed sed models . on the other hand ,",
    "the seds of galaxies in the radio are simple power laws with very similar spectral indices , and the radio  fir correlation is fairly insensitive to dust temperature .",
    "we thus only relied on the radio data to study the sfrs of kieros .",
    "we did not attempt to probe deeper at 24 @xmath8 m with stacking analyses given the large uncertainties in interpreting the results .",
    "instead , we stacked the radio , millimeter , and submillimeter fluxes of the mips detected and undetected kieros , to see whether the stacked fluxes are dominated by the few 24 @xmath8 m detected sources and hence whether there are also passive objects in the kiero selection .",

    "furthermore , if we exclude the @xmath216jy sources from our radio stacking analyses , as we did in section  [ sec_radio ] , then the mean radio flux of the remaining 157 non - mips sources is @xmath217 @xmath8jy .",
    "this is comparable to the result of @xmath126 @xmath8jy for all @xmath166jy sources .",

    "an additional reason for using the radio is the higher s / n in the stacked radio fluxes .",

    ", we identified agns using x - ray , mir , and radio data .",
    "this allows us to exclude agns from our sample .",
    "furthermore , most of the kieros have radio fluxes well below 100 @xmath8jy . at @xmath230",

    "this agrees with the conversion in @xcite to within 10% and is @xmath248 higher than that in @xcite .    in table  [ tab_sfr ] we present the star formation properties of the kieros based on the stacked radio fluxes .",
    "the upper half of the table is for all kieros , and the lower half is for kieros without x - ray , mir , and radio agns .",
    "it can be seen that excluding agns only slightly decreases the mean radio fluxes , except in the highest redshift bin , where the stacked radio fluxes are significantly biased by the two radio agns .",
    "this supports the argument that most of the kieros have radio emission powered by star formation .",
    "below we will limit our discussion to the non - agn results .",

    "they are also close to the lower end of typical dusty galaxies found by millimeter and submillimeter single - dish surveys ( @xmath249 ) .",
    "this is what we expected for the kiero color selection .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the sfrs of the kieros without redshifts .",
    "if their redshift distribution is similar to that of kieros with redshifts , then they would be roughly an order of magnitude less luminous , or luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is possible that these @xmath0 and irac faint sources are at higher redshifts .",
    "a mean radio flux of 1.9 @xmath8jy from @xmath2304 would imply a sfr of @xmath250 and a ulirg luminosity",
    ". we can thus safely conclude that most of the kieros are at least lirgs at high redshifts , and many of them are starbursting ulirgs .",
    "we investigated whether there is a correlation between stellar mass and sfr .",
    "we did this only in the @xmath764 range because of the sample size . for @xmath763 , we divided the non - agn kieros into three groups according to their stellar masses : @xmath251 ( 7 sources ) , @xmath252@xmath253 ( 11 sources ) , and @xmath254 ( 7 sources ) .",

    "therefore , even the most massive kieros in our sample are still actively forming stars , and there is no evidence for a significant number of massive and passive galaxies in the kiero population .",
    "this is quite different than other high - redshift red galaxies .",
    "we believe this is because our kiero color selection avoids the 4000    balmer break ( a signature of old stars ) and primarily picks up galaxies with continuous red spectral slopes ( a signature of dust extinction ) .",
    "we estimated the contributions of kieros to the cosmic star formation , i.e. , their sfrd .",
    "normally , one would like to apply the @xmath261 method @xcite for calculating volume . here , since most of our sources are not individually detected in the radio , applying such a method is effectively introducing additional weighting according to their @xmath0 or 4.5 @xmath8 m properties in the radio stacking analyses .",
    "it is unclear to us whether this would bias the results .",
    "therefore , we simply adopt total comoving volumes in the four redshift bins in table  [ tab_sfr ] for our survey area ( 0.06 deg@xmath2 ) .",
    "the derived sfrd for the sources with redshifts are listed in the table and shown in figure  [ fig_sfrd ] ( solid squares ) .",
    "these values are lower limits for the following reasons : ( 1 ) they are not corrected for the substantial incompleteness in the @xmath0 and 4.5  @xmath8 m bands ; ( 2 ) they do not include star formation in the kieros identified as agns ; and ( 3 ) they do not include contributions from the kieros without redshifts .",
    "if we assume that the redshift distribution of the kieros without redshifts is similar to that of the kieros with redshifts , then the sfrd values in table  [ tab_sfr ] would increase by 20% in all four redshift bins . on the other hand , if we assume that the kieros without redshifts are , on average , from higher redshifts , then their contribution to the sfrd would be substantial .",
    "for example , if we assume that they are at @xmath161 , then the sfrds at @xmath161 would increase by 60% ( open squares in figure  [ fig_sfrd ] ) .",
    "the sfrd values we found are comparable to those for bright smgs at similar redshifts @xcite , but we note that not all the bright smgs are kieros . in wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , we found a nearly flat sfrd of @xmath2620.15 @xmath10 yr@xmath11 mpc@xmath263 at @xmath2644 , from our radio and 850  @xmath8 m stacking analyses of a large 1.6 and 3.6  @xmath8 m selected nir sample ( dashed line in figure  [ fig_sfrd ] , while the dotted line shows the same sfrd maximally corrected for incompleteness in the @xmath2643 range ) .",
    "naively speaking , the kieros should be a subsample of the larger nir sample of wang et al .",
    "however , the clean - like procedure employed in w10 for this work provides many more 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath8 m detected sources and better photometry . by comparing the list of kieros with our 3.6 @xmath8 m catalog compiled in 2006",
    ", we found that 45% of the kieros in the scuba area were missed by wang et al .",
    "the missed kieros have a broad range of 3.6 @xmath8 m fluxes and the same irac image is used in both works , so this is not an effect of different detection limits . because of this , comparing the sfrd here with that in wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is not straightforward .",
    "we also compare our sfrds with recent extinction corrected rest - frame uv determinations from lbgs ( @xcite , open diamonds in figure  [ fig_sfrd ] ; @xcite , open triangles ) . at @xmath161 , the sfrd of the kieros is similar in magnitude to the sfrd of the extinction corrected lbgs . at @xmath33 ,",
    "the kiero sfrd contribution becomes only @xmath265 of that of lbgs .",
    "this might be explained by the fact that kieros do not include all smgs and therefore they only account for part of the dusty star formation .",
    "however , even the radio / submillimeter sfrd determined by stacking on a large nir sample by wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ; dashed line in figure  [ fig_sfrd ] ) is significantly lower than the sfrd of the extinction corrected lbgs .",

    "one important finding in wang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is that most of the submillimeter ebl arises from galaxies with intermediate rest - frame colors , i.e. , galaxies not as blue as lbgs .",
    "the combination of these points suggests that a substantial amount of high - redshift star formation can not be traced by rest - frame uv emission , and that the total sfrd should be the sum of the sfrd from lbgs and the sfrd from dusty sources .",
    "this would give a very large total sfrd at @xmath266 , which raises the question of whether the large extinction corrected lbg sfrd is overestimated .",
    "@xcite stacked radio fluxes of @xmath230 lbgs in the cosmos field and found that the radio inferred mean sfr of these lbgs is only 1.8 times the _ extinction uncorrected _ mean uv sfr .",
    "they pointed out that this is much smaller than the factor of @xmath267 generally adopted for high - redshift lbgs .",
    "furthermore , @xcite could not detect the radio signal from @xmath24 lbgs with an extremely deep radio stacking analysis in the goods - n and s fields .",
    "their inferred radio sfr of @xmath24 lbgs is only consistent with the extinction corrected uv sfr in @xcite if a 2  @xmath31 radio flux upper limit is adopted .",
    "this result also suggests a discrepancy between the radio sfr and the dust - corrected uv sfr .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is unclear .",
    "in addition to the possibilities discussed in @xcite , another possibility is the correlation between fir flux and uv spectral slope @xcite assumed in many high - redshift lbg studies .",
    "recent observations show substantial scatter in this correlation @xcite , and this may contribute to the uncertainty in the uv extinction correction . this issue will require further investigation , especially once direct measurements of the fir luminosities of lbgs with sensitive instruments such as alma and _ herschel _ become available .",
    "@xcite used the acs @xmath268 ( f850lp ) image and the irac 3.6  @xmath8 m image in the hudf and found 17 irac selected extremely red objects ( ieros ) with @xmath269 ( also see * ? ? ?",

    "this is also very similar to the seds of kieros ( figure  [ fig_sed ] and section  [ sec_redshift ] ) , except that some kieros are too faint in the optical for the rest - frame uv components to be detected .",
    "the stellar masses derived from the sed fitting for ieros and kieros are also similar , approximately @xmath274@xmath275 . in section  [ sec_data ]",
    ", we showed that 14 out of the 28 identified smgs in the goods - n are kieros .",
    "if we include @xmath52-band upper limits , then 22 out of the 28 smgs are ieros .",
    "this fraction is even higher than kieros .",

    "they found a mean radio flux of @xmath276 from 96 ieros at @xmath763 after excluding 3 sources detected at @xmath30 , where 1 @xmath31 is @xmath27717 @xmath8jy in their observations . with a similar @xmath278 @xmath8jy cut in our stacking of @xmath763 kieros , the stacked radio flux is @xmath279 @xmath8jy , quite comparable to ieros at similar redshifts .",
    "the only difference here is that nearly 10% of kieros ( 2 out of 27 ) are above the 50  @xmath8jy flux cut , but only 3% of ieros in @xcite are above this cut , indicating that the kiero population contains more ulirgs .",

    "color diagram in figure  [ fig_iero ] we see that the iero selection and the kiero selection overlap at high redshift on dusty sources .",
    "the difference is in the low - redshift end .",
    "in the lower - right part of the diagram , early - type galaxies ( including those not forming stars ) enter the iero selection at @xmath280 or so .",
    "such galaxies do not enter the kiero selection at @xmath33 .",
    "the upper - left part of the diagram is more interesting , i.e. , galaxies that are kieros but not ieros .",
    "such galaxies have blue @xmath281 colors that are consistent with starbursting galaxies at @xmath282 , simply based on the color tracks .",
    "these kieros are not @xmath282 galaxies . instead ,",
    "as described in section  [ sec_stellar ] , they have two distinct stellar populations .",
    "their massive and reddened stellar populations make them redder than the kiero criterion , and the unobscured parts of their ongoing starbursts make them bluer than the iero criterion . in short , ieros contain more early - type galaxies , and kieros contain more dusty sources with ongoing star formation .",
    "we believe this is a consequence of the fact that the kiero selection avoids the balmer break but targets the red spectral slopes caused by strong dust extinction .",
    "in addition to ieros , distant red galaxies ( drgs , @xmath283 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are another interesting population with which to compare .",
    "drgs have redshifts roughly between 2 and 4 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to kieros and ieros .",
    "we therefore expect a substantial overlap between the drg and kiero populations . unfortunately , there is not yet a @xmath52-band image in the goods - n that is sufficiently deep and wide to verify this .",

    "finally , in the extremely deep _ hst _ nicmos f110w image of the hdf - n ( e.g. , @xcite ; rms @xmath287 @xmath8jy ) , there are only three kieros .",
    "only one of them is detected in the @xmath0-band and it is not a drg .",

    "( 2006 ) found an 850  @xmath8 m ebl contribution of @xmath304 jy deg@xmath78 from a sample of 1.6 and 3.6  @xmath8 m selected sources at @xmath42 .",
    "this leaves at most 1528 jy deg@xmath78 to sources at @xmath12 , of which @xmath30527% can be attributed to the kiero sample here",
    ". the actual fraction should be even larger considering the fact that the kiero selection is still severely limited by completeness at @xmath0 and 4.5  @xmath8 m . to determine whether or not kieros can fully account for the ebl that arises at @xmath12",
    ", we will need both a better determination of the kiero number counts and a better ebl measurement .",
    "in section  [ sec_lbg ] we showed that the dust attenuation of the rest - frame uv radiation of kieros is roughly a factor of 10 or even higher .",
    "it is now known that some of the most luminous millimeter or submillimeter selected galaxies can be entirely hidden by dust in the optical and even in the nir ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the work presented here shows that there are still extremely extinguished galaxies when we go roughly an order of magnitude fainter in the total ir luminosity .",
    "our kiero color selection picks up such galaxies at @xmath2275 , but the @xmath0 and irac images become less sensitive to galaxies at @xmath161 . with a narrow selection window between @xmath5 and 4 and",
    "the completeness limits in the @xmath0 and the 4.5 @xmath8 m bands , we already pick up roughly 10% of the total ebl at 850  @xmath8 m and 1100  @xmath8 m .",
    "the total fraction of background that arises from extremely extinguished galaxies from @xmath306 to @xmath307 should be even higher than this .",
    "we thus expect a significant fraction ( @xmath308 ) of cosmic star formation to be entirely hidden from deep optical observations .",
    "the kiero color selection is meant to pick up objects with red spectral slopes over broad wavelength ranges and to avoid the 4000    balmer break .",
    "this makes it sensitive to dusty starbursting galaxies .",
    "the fact that the kieros are selected near the peak of their stellar seds ( i.e. , the rest - frame 1.6  @xmath8 m bump ) also means that it is sensitive to massive systems . in section  [ sec_redshift ]",
    "we showed that most kieros have stellar masses of @xmath252 to @xmath19 @xmath10 .",
    "in section  [ sec_sfr ] we showed that most kieros are ulirgs with @xmath309 and are actively forming stars .",
    "the masses of kieros are very similar to those of bright 850  @xmath8 m selected smgs at @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean 850  @xmath8 m flux of kieros ( 1.44 mjy ) is below the confusion limit of single - disk telescopes .",
    "its corresponding ir luminosity ( assuming a dust sed similar to arp 220 ) are a few times lower than those of most smgs selected at 850  @xmath8 m by single - dish telescopes .",
    "this suggests that kieros are massive galaxies undergoing slightly less intensive starbursts compared to bright smgs .    in section  [ sec_data ] we found that half of the identified smgs in the goods - n are kieros .",
    "the fraction of smgs that are drgs is comparable ( sections  [ sec_drg ] ) , and the fraction of smgs that are ieros is significantly higher ( @xmath310 , section  [ sec_iero ] ) .",
    "however , this does not mean that all of these color selections are equally efficient in picking up dusty sources .",
    "the iero and drg selections pick up substantial numbers of passive and @xmath42 galaxies ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , in our radio stacking analyses of kieros , we did not see evidence for a significant subpopulation of passive kieros . this is true even after we introduce a 24 @xmath8 m selection to our radio stacking analyses ( section  [ sec_mips ] ) .",
    "it is especially remarkable that approximately 1/3 of kieros are not detected by acs .",
    "such uv - faint sources would be considered as `` passive '' by many studies , but these kieros are even brighter in the radio than uv - bright kieros , indicating that they are more active in star formation .",
    "this distinguishes the kiero selection from the iero and drg selections .",
    "we believe the kiero selection is more effective in picking up dusty starburst galaxies and contains fewer passive galaxies .",
    "in this paper we provide estimates of stellar masses and sfrs of kieros .",
    "another crucial parameter for understanding the evolution is gas mass , which is not yet established for this new population of galaxies .",
    "given the great similarity ( sfrs , dust obscuration , and stellar masses ) between kieros and bright smgs , it is likely that the two populations are similarly massive in molecular gas mass .",
    "recent observations of high-@xmath52 co transitions of smgs found molecular gas masses of a few @xmath70 @xcite . if kieros are similarly rich in molecular gas , they can sustain their ultraluminous starburst phase for @xmath311 myr .",
    "in other words , they can significantly increase their stellar masses in less than @xmath312 of their hubble time .",
    "to summarize , the kiero selection seems to pick up a sample of massive and dusty @xmath12 galaxies .",
    "they are forming stars actively .",
    "this is consistent with massive galaxies at @xmath12 that are still rapidly building up their mass .",
    "the properties of kieros are similar to their more luminous counterparts ( smgs ) , as well as to high - redshift massive galaxies selected in the irac bands ( e.g. , ieros and drgs ; see also @xcite ) . in each of these various selections we are likely seeing different regions of the luminosity function or different stages in the formation of the most massive galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "eventually these galaxies will become quiescent and passively evolve into the `` downsizing '' era .",
    "however , at high redshifts , most of them seem to be still active . because of the dust obscuration , common for the most intensive star - forming systems , a complete view of such massive and active galaxies requires observations at both long and short wavelengths .",
    "in order to find high - redshift , faint , dusty sources that may give rise to a significant fraction of the submillimeter ebl , we selected 196 kieros with extremely red colors of @xmath22  @xmath8m@xmath23 in the 0.06 deg@xmath2 goods - n region .",
    "the selected kieros have a range of 4.5  @xmath8 m fluxes , mostly between 1 and 10 @xmath8jy . of the 196 kieros ,",
    "104 kieros are detected in the @xmath0 band , and the slope of the @xmath0 number counts for these sources is steeper than that of @xmath0 selected galaxies at similar flux levels , likely because kieros are at redshifts higher than @xmath0 selected galaxies .",
    "the counts also still seem to be rising at the @xmath0 detection limit of @xmath37 @xmath8jy .",
    "roughly 2/3s of kieros are detected in the optical by _ hst _ acs .",
    "however , only 1/5 of the acs - detected kieros are lbgs .",
    "the remaining acs detected kieros all have optical continua that are too red to pass the lbg selection .",
    "we performed a photometric redshift analysis on a @xmath0-bright subsample of 76 kieros .",
    "we found a redshift distribution between @xmath2275 , with roughly 70% at @xmath54 .",
    "this redshift distribution is quite similar to that of bright smgs , but with a bias to high redshift .",
    "our photometric redshift analysis also shows large stellar masses of @xmath252@xmath7 .",
    "we found that a significant fraction of kieros have seds that can not be well fitted by simple stellar populations .",
    "they have massive old stellar components that are luminous in the nir and ongoing starbursts that are detected in the optical .",
    "we found that roughly half of the identified millimeter and submillimeter sources in the goods - n are selected as kieros , but such sources only represent 7% of the selected kieros .",
    "to study the radio , millimeter , and submillimeter properties of the remaining kieros , we carried out stacking analyses .",
    "we found that , on average , kieros are brighter than normal 4.5  @xmath8 m selected galaxies by factors of @xmath313 and @xmath31410 in the radio and in the millimeter and submillimeter , respectively",
    ". we also found that kieros undetected by acs are @xmath3154 times brighter in all these wavebands than kieros detected by acs .",
    "we repeated the stacking analyses on kieros undetected in the radio , millimeter , and submillimeter .",
    "these faint kieros still possess detectable stacking signal , showing that their properties are not dominated by small numbers of bright sources .",
    "we also did not find evidence of passive kieros based on the 24 @xmath8 m to radio data .",
    "we identified agns in the kiero sample with large x - ray and radio luminosities , and with mir seds that are featureless red power laws .",
    "we identified 19 such sources , of which 2/3 are obscured agns identified in the mir .",
    "we also found an agn fraction of up to 1/3 .    using the local radio  fir correlation of normal galaxies and the stacked radio fluxes of non - agn kieros",
    ", we found that they are lirgs and ulirgs .",
    "the results are consistent with the kieros being a population of @xmath12 ultraluminous dusty galaxies that are slightly fainter than smgs in the millimeter and submillimeter and undetected by single - dish surveys .",
    "their large ir luminosities imply high sfrs of @xmath3161200 @xmath10 yr@xmath11 , and therefore a population of massive @xmath12 galaxies in rapid formation .",
    "we showed that kieros contribute roughly 10% to the total ebl at 850 and 1100  @xmath8 m and up to 30% of the ebl at these wavelengths which arises from galaxies at @xmath12 .",
    "given that kieros and lbgs have very little overlap and that optically faint kieros are brighter in the radio , millimeter and submillimeter , these results indicate that a significant fraction ( @xmath308 ) of cosmic star formation is hidden by dust and can not be traced by rest - frame uv emission .",
