    "there are now approximately fifty planets known around other stars ( marcy et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this is a sufficiently large number that statistically meaningful trends among the properties of the stars - with - planets ( swps ) sample may help understand aspects of planet formation , evolution , and distribution .",
    "for example , there are several claims that swps have higher metallicities than stars of similar spectral type in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. gonzalez 1997 ) .",
    "the metallicities of fgk dwarfs in the solar neighborhood are strongly peaked around [ fe / h]@xmath0 ; less than 25% of these stars have [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.0 and less than 5% have [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.2 ( see wyse & gilmore 1995 and rocha - pinto & machiel 1998 ) .",
    "this result is based largely on medium - band photometry of a large number of stars ( twarog 1980 ; olsen 1983 ; olsen 1993 ) , although it is consistent with the smaller sample ( 91 g & k dwarfs ) observed spectroscopically by favata et al .",
    "in contrast , gonzalez & laws ( 2000 ) and santos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) use high resolution spectroscopic observations to show that swps are comparatively metal rich : @xmath290% have [ fe / h]@xmath10.0 and @xmath260% have [ fe / h]@xmath10.2 .",
    "similar results are reported by gonzalez ( 1998 ) , gonzalez & vanture ( 1998 ) , and gonzalez , wallerstein , & saar ( 1999 ) .",
    "note that gimenez ( 2000 ) shows that medium - band photometry of swps also gives consistenly high [ fe / h ] values .",
    "formally , the statistical significance of this difference between the metallicity of swps and fgk dwarfs in the solar neighborhood is very high .",
    "however , there is some possibility that systematic effects could affect the reality of the difference ; e.g. that some observational selection effect allows planets around metal rich stars to be detected with greater ease ( although see butler et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "suppose , however , that swps are indeed apparently more metal rich than other stars .",
    "one popular explanation is that the apparent increase in the observed metallicity is due to accretion of planetary material , which enriches the star s convective envelope ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ; rasio & ford 1996 ; murray et al . 1998 ; quillen & holman 2000 ) .",
    "for example , the dissolution of jupiter into the sun s convective envelope would raise the observed metallicity of the sun by roughly 0.09 dex ( assuming jupiter is roughly 10% metals in solar proportions ) .",
    "the stability of the convective envelope throughout the main sequence life of a star suggests that this elevated metallicity would be observed for very long times , assuming the accretion took place after the star arrived on the main sequence ( laughlin & adams 1997 ) .",
    "murray et al .",
    "( 2000 ) examine a related possibility : the accretion of @xmath20.5 m@xmath3 of rocky material during the heavy bombardment phase .    in this paper",
    "we examine the possibility that accretion of planetary material could appreciably affect the observed metallicities of stars .",
    "we find that hotter , more massive stars should be dramatically more sensitive to accretion , but that this is contrary to what is observed .",
    "we suspect , therefore , that accretion is not the primary cause of the enhanced metallicities in swps .",
    "we constructed stellar models in the effective temperature range where giant planets have been observed ; this corresponds to masses of 0.6 - 1.3 in 0.1 solar mass increments .",
    "these models did not include the effects of rotational mixing or microscopic diffusion ( used in this paper to include the effects of gravitational settling , thermal diffusion , and radiative levitation ) ; the possible impact of these phenomena is discussed later . the basic physics in these standard models has been described elsewhere ( sills , pinsonneault , & terndrup 2000 ) ; we summarize the basic ingredients here .",
    "our base case is constructed with the solar heavy element to hydrogen ratio z / x of 0.0245 from the heavy element mixture of grevesse & noels ( 1993 ) .",
    "we use the opal equation of state ( rogers , swenson , & iglesias 1996 ) where available and the saumon , chabrier , & van horn ( 1995 ) equation of state in regions of parameter space where opal data is not available ; we ramp between the two eos at the edges of the opal tables .",
    "nuclear reaction rates are taken from adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; following the results of gruzinov & bahcall ( 1998 ) we adopt the approximation of weak screening for nuclear reaction rates .",
    "we use opal95 opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) above @xmath4 k and molecular opacities from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) below . for the solar abundance models we use",
    "allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) model atmospheres at @xmath5 for a surface boundary condition .",
    "we calibrate our models to reproduce the solar radius ( @xmath6 cm ) and luminosity ( @xmath7 ) at the solar age ( 4.57 gyr ; see bahcall & pinsonneault 1995 . )",
    "this gave a solar y = 0.266 and mixing length @xmath8 .",
    "our models were started in the pre - ms at the mass - radius relationship given by stahler ( 1988 ) .",
    "these models were evolved to an age of 4.57 gyr to test for the dependence of convection zone depth on age .",
    "the allard & hauschildt ( 1995 ) atmospheres are not available for a fine grid of metal abundances near solar , so we constructed zams models with [ fe / h ] from -0.3 to + 0.2 in 0.1 dex increments using the kurucz ( 1994 ) model atmospheres as a surface boundary conditions .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , the choice of surface boundary condition does not have a major impact on the predicted depth of the convection zone as a function of effective temperature .",
    "figure 1 shows the predicted mass of the convective zone as a function of stellar effective temperature .",
    "large changes in the assumed intial metallicity and age of the star make very little difference to the result ; the maximum difference over a wide set of input initial conditions is only @xmath20.15 dex . there is a straightforward physical explanation : the depth of convection zones in main sequence stars depends primarily on the position within the star of the hydrogen and helium ionization zones .",
    "it is a well - known result of stellar structure and evolution that along the main sequence the temperature decreases and the density increases at fixed mass fraction as the total stellar mass decreases .",
    "this can be demonstrated analytically by simple homology relationship ( cf .",
    "kippenhahn & thomas 1991 ) .",
    "these effects cause ionization zones where the opacity is high to be systematically located in deeper layers for lower mass stars .",
    "there will therefore be progressively deeper surface convection zones for lower mass stars .",
    "the effective temperature is a useful proxy for this : stars will necessarily have low density in the photosphere , so the effective temperature of the star sets the starting point in the @xmath9 plane which determines the depth of ionization zones .",
    "we note that stars evolving off the main sequence obey a similar , if not identical , convection zone depth as a function of effective temperature ; the principal physical difference is the lower surface gravity in these stars .",
    "our result also implies that the surface convection zone depth of stars with enhanced metal abundances only in the convective envelope ( through enrichment by planetesimals , for example ) will be the similar to those of normal stars of the same effective temperature .",
    "the models demonstrate that the stellar effective temperature is the best diagnostic of the depth of the surface convection zone .",
    "the effective temperature of a star is also directly observable .",
    "this correspondence between a theoretically meaningful metric and an observable quantity is fortunate and eliminates the need to compute or estimate quantities such as stellar mass and age .",
    "figure 2 shows [ fe / h ] versus stellar effective temperature ( t@xmath10 ) for 33 swps derived from high resolution spectra by gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , santos et al . ( 2000 ) , gonzalez et al . ( 1999 ) , gonzalez & vanture ( 1998 ) , and gonzalez & laws ( 2000 ) .",
    "there may be a slight trend of increasing metallicity with increasing t@xmath10 as noted by laughlin ( 2000 ) and gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . also shown in figure 2 is the effect of adding 1 @xmath11 , 3 @xmath11 , and 10 @xmath11 of fe to the convection zone of stars with a range of initial [ fe / h ] .",
    "this is roughly the amount of fe present in 0.5 @xmath12 , 1.7 @xmath12 , and 5.5 @xmath12 planets ( see murray et al . 2001 and guillot 1999 ) .",
    "roughly half of the relatively cool swps ( t@xmath10 @xmath13 5800k ) have very high values of metallicities : [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.3 .",
    "if these stars began their main sequence lives with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath140.2 to 0.0 , then they must have accreted at least @xmath210 @xmath11 of fe .",
    "if the hotter stars had accreted this amount of fe , however , the [ fe / h ] should be @xmath1 0.6 for any star with t@xmath10 @xmath1 6000k . clearly , this pattern is not observed .",
    "in fact , there are no stars known with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 0.6 ( castro et al . 1997 ) .",
    "further , the two most metal rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath15 0.5 ) stars in the swp sample have t@xmath10 @xmath15 5300k .",
    "if these stars began with [ fe / h ] @xmath15 0.0 , they must have accreted @xmath225 @xmath11 of fe .",
    "a star with t@xmath10 @xmath15 6200k that accreted this amount of fe would have [ fe / h ] @xmath15 1 !",
    "presumably , such an extremely unusual star would already been identified in the solar neighborhood .    alternatively , if the hotter stars intially had [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath140.2 to 0.0 , then they could have accreted no more than @xmath21 @xmath11 of fe .",
    "if the cooler stars accreted this amount of fe , then they must have started with [ fe / h ] @xmath2 @xmath160.2 , substantially higher than the solar neighborhood mean .",
    "in standard stellar models convection is the only mixing mechanism , so it is straightforward to convert a given contribution of heavy elements onto a star into an enhancement in its surface [ fe / h ] .",
    "there are three major classes of effects that could dilute enhancements of the heavy elements in surface layers of stars : mass loss , microscopic diffusion , and envelope mixing driven by stellar rotation .",
    "we find that none of these has a major impact on our conclusions .",
    "mass loss , for example , removes part of the total envelope mass of a star , so a surface metal enhancement is reduced for two reasons : there is a lower total mass and t@xmath10 ( therefore a deeper surface cz and more dilution ) and enriched material is preferentially removed .",
    "the first effect is taken care of by considering the current t@xmath10 . the second effect is small because main sequence mass loss rates are very small .",
    "the solar mass loss rate is of order @xmath17 solar masses per year ; this implies a total mass loss over the solar lifetime of order @xmath18 solar masses .",
    "even if this much lost matter is replaced with undiluted material , there is an insignificant correction to the total surface abundance even in the hottest stars we consider .",
    "diffusion is the process whereby heavy elements will sink with respect to light ones in the presence of a gravitational potential ; this can be counteracted by radiative levitation for partially ionized species .",
    "the latter effect is most important for stars with much thinner surface convection zones than we consider ( see richer , michaud , & turcotte 2000 for an example ) .",
    "modern calculations provide estimates of the rate of gravitational settling / thermal diffusion that significantly improve the agreement between helioseismic data and solar models ( e.g. bahcall , pinsonneault , & basu 2001 ) .",
    "the overall effect in solar models is small , roughly 10% for heavy elements by the age of the sun .",
    "the effect would increase to higher masses and effective temperatures , reaching @xmath230% at 6400k .",
    "the surface helium abundance would drop by the same process , boosting the reduction in the surface [ fe / h ] by a modest amount .",
    "the convection zone depth changes by a factor of twenty across the mass range of swps , so gravitational settling corresponds to a perturbation on a strong mass - dependent trend .",
    "furthermore , the difference in the degree of metal diffusion is partially counteracted by the longer main sequence lifetimes of the lower mass stars ; solar mass stars would experience approximately a 20% effect by the end of their main sequence evolution .",
    "also , diffusion may be inhibited by other processes in stars hotter than the sun .",
    "lithium data can also be used to constrain mass - dependent diffusion processes ( chaboyer et al .",
    "lithium settles at approximately the same rate as helium ; both settle faster than heavier elements .",
    "the absence of a strong downwards trend in halo star lithium abundances with increased effective temperature sets constraints on the mass dependence of element segregation in these stars . because they are older and hotter than the range we are considering ,",
    "this in turn implies that such effects will be even smaller in the systems with planets .",
    "strong effects are possible in hotter stars in the vicinity of the mid - f star lithium dip ( boesgaard & trippicco 1986 ; see however deliyannis et al .",
    "1998 ) , but planets have not yet been detected in this mass range .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of metal diffusion may have a modest ( @xmath210 - 15% ) effect on the surface metal abundances of stars ( which affects the zero - point of the dilution ) , but will not have a strong impact on the predicted behavior of metal overabundance as a function of mass .",
    "there is strong empirical evidence for mild envelope mixing driven by rotation in lower main sequence stars ( see pinsonneault 1997 ) .",
    "lithium is a useful diagnostic since it is destroyed around 2.5@xmath1910@xmath20 k , so any mixing process that reaches this temperature can affect the surface abundance .",
    "standard models predict lithium depletion consistent with observations in young open clusters ( e.g. soderblom et al .",
    "1993 ) . however , measured lithium abundances show a marked decline on the main sequence . the meteoritic lithium abundance [ li / h ] is 3.3 ( where h = 12 ) .",
    "young cluster stars have [ li / h ] @xmath2 3.2 for stars with t@xmath10 above 6000k , declining to @xmath22.0 at 5600k and @xmath22.8 at 5000k . by comparison ,",
    "the solar photospheric [ li / h ] is 1.1 , while typical abundances at 6200k in m67 are 2.2 - 2.6 ( jones , fischer , & soderblom 1999 ) .",
    "relative to young main sequence solar analogues , the sun is depleted by roughly 1.7 dex , while stars in the old open cluster m67 at a temperature of 6200 k are depleted by about 0.6 - 1.0 dex relative to the meteoritic abundance .",
    "this phenomenon could therefore possibly have significant impact on surface metal enrichment from the infall of planetesimals .    however , there are some important differences between the mixing of heavy elements that do not experience nuclear processing and lithium , which is destroyed .",
    "solar models which include both heavy element diffusion and mixing sufficient to explain lithium remove only about 25% of the effects of metal diffusion ( richard et al . 1996 ; bahcall , pinsonneault , & basu 2001 ) .",
    "metal diffusion creates a composition gradient at the base of the surface convective zone during the main sequence , which is similar to what would occur with planetesimal accretion .",
    "the difference between the lithium depletion for the sun and the lithium depletion for the hotter stars is largely a reflection of the greater distance between the base of the surface convection zone and the temperature where lithium is destroyed .    to estimate the interaction of mixing and envelope metal enhancement , we constructed two simplified models with 1.0 and 1.2 m@xmath21 and ran them from the pre - ms to an age of 100 myr .",
    "we used an initial [ fe / h ] of + 0.2 ; the convection zone depths were of order 0.032 and 0.006 m@xmath21 . respectively .",
    "we then enforced solid body rotation at a period of 2.5 days ( typical for young open cluster stars ) and artificially enhanced the surface abundance of a trace element by a factor of 10 to mimic the sudden increase in metal abundance from accretion .",
    "the model was then evolved with rotational mixing and angular momentum loss as described by pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and gravitational settling of metals and heavy elements ( bahcall & pinsonneault 1995 . )",
    "our primary interest was the relationship between surface lithium depletion and the reduction of any surface metallicity enhancement .",
    "as expected , there was an initial transient in the surface abundance from the presence of a step function in abundance of the trace element and the time delay for lithium - depleted material to reach the surface .",
    "we therefore believe that the most reliable technique is to compare the late - time behavior of the depletion ; from stellar lithium data the degree of mixing between 100 myr and 500 myr is roughly equivalent to the degree of mixing between 500 myr and 5 gyr because of the strong decline in stellar rotation with increased age .    between 500 myr and 4 gyr",
    ", we found a net reduction of 0.35 dex in li and 0.22 dex in the surface heavy element abundances in the hotter star ( @xmath26050k ) ; the cooler star ( @xmath25500 k ) had a net decrease of 0.55 dex in li and 0.1 dex in the heavy element abundance .",
    "these rough estimates would be doubled from the zero - age main sequence , if the depletion factor at early epochs was similar to the late - time behavior .",
    "starting from 100 myr abundances of 3.1 and 2.7 respectively , this would imply hyades - age surface lithium abundances of 2.8 and 2.15 , with m67 age abundances of 2.45 and 1.6 respectively .",
    "these are consistent with open cluster observations .",
    "this is across a 500 k range and a factor of five in surface convection zone depth . by comparison ,",
    "the swps at 6100 k have surface lithium abundances in the range of 2.4 - 2.7 , which would correspond to a 0.2 - 0.4 dex decrease of a large 1 dex initial enhancement of the surface metal abundance .",
    "an even more significant clue as to the limited impact of mixing is the star tau boo ( hd 120136 ) , which has a low surface lithium abundance of 1.0 , a temperature of 6400 k , and an [ fe / h ] of + 0.32 ( gonzalez & laws 2000 ) . the low lithium abundance is a sign of extensive mixing and yet the surface abundance is still very high .",
    "if swps were lower metallicity objects with polluted surfaces , we would expect this star to have _ low _ metal abundance unless the initial abundance was absurdly high ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 2 ! ) .",
    "furthermore , the lithium abundances of swps do not appear to be drastically different from other stars of comparable mass and age ( ryan 2000 ) , which further suggests that they have not experienced unusual depletion patterns .",
    "we therefore believe that mixing in the temperature range below the lithium dip will not have a dramatic impact on our conclusions .",
    "a separate paper with more detailed discussion of these effects is in preparation .",
    "careful modeling shows that the convective zone masses in fgk main sequence stars decreases dramatically with stellar mass .",
    "convective zone masses in f stars , for example , are more than 10 times less massive than in k stars .",
    "thus , we expect that accretion of planetary material by stars while on the main sequence should lead to extremely high apparent metallicities in early - type stars .",
    "physical processes not included in standard models , such as rotational mixing and diffusion , will provide only modest changes in this trend .",
    "in particular , the measured surface lithium abundances for some swps constrains the degree to which extra mixing could have reduced any initial enrichment .",
    "the models demonstrate that the measured stellar effective temperature is a good diagnostic of the surface convection zone depth across a wide range of metallicities and main sequence ages .",
    "data obtained to date on swps suggests that there is no strong trend of metallicity enhancement with stellar effective temperature .",
    "therefore , we conclude that unless swps somehow know to accrete planetary material in a manner that is inversely proportional to their own stellar mass ( and in a very non - linear way ) , then it seems unlikely that the possibly enhanced metallicites of swps is caused by accretion of planetary material .",
    "if the suggestion that swps are more metal - rich than typical stars is confirmed , our results imply that swps have high surface metal abundances because they were born that way , rather than requiring significant pollution of their outer layers by accretion of planetary material .",
    "this suggests a metallicity threshold for the formation of ( at least ) massive planets close to stars .",
    "we can not exclude modest infall which would not cause a large surface metallicity enhancement ( at the @xmath13 1 @xmath11 level ) or models where doomed jupiters penetrate the surface convective zone ( sandquist et al .",
    "if pollution of the outer layers of stars by infall is significant , the best sample in which to test this idea is in stars with t@xmath10 around 6200k , since the surface convective zones in these stars have little mass and even a small amount of accretion would result in very high apparent metal abundances .",
    "this work was stimulated by discussions during the morning coffee of the osu astronomy department .",
    "these daily doses of caffeine and discussion involve many members of the department , but r. pogge , d. weinberg , and d. terndrup were particularly vocal on this subject .",
