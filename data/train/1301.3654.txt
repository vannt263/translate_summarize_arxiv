    "the interaction of graphene with metal adsorbates is one of the important research topics since the first successful experimental exploration of graphene .",
    "@xcite virtually any device assembly incorporating graphene will necessarily include graphene - metal contacts .",
    "titanium has been widely used for metal contacts on graphene with good adsorption properties .",
    "@xcite moreover , the interaction between titanium and graphitic surfaces and nanotubes has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "@xcite ti atoms are able to act as adsorption centers for molecular binding .",
    "@xcite furthermore , ti coated nanotubes and graphene have also been proposed for high - capacity hydrogen storage solution .  @xcite    however , a recent dft study ,  @xcite as well as a very recent experimental observation ,  @xcite showed strong structural changes of the adsorbed ti layer on graphene due to the interaction with oxygen .",
    "experimentally , it was shown that the adsorbed titanium on graphene leads to substantial n - type doping and a reduction of graphene s mobility .",
    "the subsequent exposure of the samples to oxygen has restored graphene s gate dependent conductivity to almost intrinsic values , effectively cancelling any previous metal ",
    "graphene interaction .",
    "@xcite    motivated by these experimental observations we perform _ ab initio _ calculations to investigate titanium and titanium dioxide monolayers adsorbed on graphene . for the identified ground state structures ,",
    "the electronic band structure is calculated and a charge population analysis is performed to investigate the character of the charge carrier doping in graphene .",
    "we find a strong n - type doping of graphene induced by adsorbed ti and identify the highest possible monolayer coverage with stoichiometry ti@xmath1c@xmath2 .",
    "when tio@xmath0 monolayer crystals are aligned on top of the graphene surface we observe p- or n - type doping of graphene , depending on the nature of the atoms that are exposed closest to graphene with oxygen acting as an acceptor and titanium as a donor .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we describe the computational details of our _ ab initio _ calculations , followed by an investigation of the ground state structure of a titanium monolayer on graphene .",
    "next the character of the charge transfer between adsorbed ti and the graphene substrate is examined .",
    "further model titanium dioxide monolayer structures are investigated . to conclude ,",
    "we report titanium dioxide structure dependent doping of graphene and link this observation with the experimentally observed recovery of the graphene gate dependent conductivity after the oxidation of the adsorbed ti atoms .",
    "all our calculations were performed within the density functional theory ( dft ) formalism as implemented in the vasp package with usage of the local spin density approximation ( lsda ) for the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "we made use of the projector augmented wave method @xcite and a plane - wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 500 ev .",
    "the complete relaxation of atomic positions and supercell size was performed up to the level that the forces are smaller than 0.01  ev  @xmath3 .",
    "for all the used supercells , a sampling of the brillouin zone was done with the equivalent of a @xmath4 monkhorst ",
    "pack @xcite @xmath5-point grid for the graphene unit cell ( containing two carbon atoms ) .",
    "spin polarization was included in the calculations .    because periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions , the height of the supercell was set to 20   , to include enough vacuum to minimize the interaction between adjacent layers , and dipole corrections were used .",
    "all reported quantitative results of the charge transfer were calculated with the iterative hirshfeld charge population analysis .",
    "the binding energies are calculated with respect to intrisic monolayer graphene and the isolated atom / molecule of which the binding energy is reported . the formation energy for titanium covered graphene",
    "is calculated in relation to intrinsic monolayer graphene and the energy the of ti atoms in a free standing monolayer titanium crystal with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "properties of single ti atom adsorption on a graphene surface were already investigated and the most preferable adsorption site for a ti atom was found to be the hollow site with a binding energy of -1.58 ev per ti atom .",
    "the top and bridge adsorption site were found to be energetically less favorable by 0.62 ev and result in metastable states .",
    "@xcite    also high density coverage of graphene with titanium has been previously investigated and some ground state structures were proposed which have stoichiometry tic@xmath2 and tic@xmath0 with ti atoms placed on hollow sites creating monolayer metalic coverage .",
    "@xcite however , we report here a different ground state structure .",
    "as written above , a single ti atom placed on top of a free standing graphene surface is strongly bonded at the hollow site with a diffusion barrier high enough to prevent its motion on the surface even at room temperature .",
    "this fact suggests that the most preferable high coverage structure for titanium on graphene will be the one in which above every single hollow site there is one ti atom ( i.e. , one ti atom per two c atoms ) .",
    "even the lattice constants compare favourably for this structure with a mismatch of only 5  %  ( see  table  [ table_pristine_structures ] ) .",
    "we have calculated binding energies for a variety of structures with stoichiometry tic@xmath0 and we also investigated the structure g2x2 - 3ti ( displayed in fig . [ fig_ti_g_structures ] ) with a lower amount of ti atoms per c atom ( three ti atoms per eight c atoms ) and a larger lattice mismatch of -9 % ( ti atoms are spaced further apart from each other in comparison to the titanium monolayer crystal ) .",
    "the calculated formation energy of -0.93 ev per ti for g2x2 - 3ti system was found to be lowest among all the investigated structures .",
    "the lowest formation energy for the tic@xmath0 system was found to be -0.76 ev per ti , for the structure consisting of adatoms placed above hollow sites with every fourth ti atom displaced further from the graphene substrate ( see fig . [ fig_ti_g_md](d ) initial state ) .",
    "substantial formation energy advantage makes the g2x2 - 3ti system virtually the only plausible structure for titanium atoms on graphene at large coverage densities .",
    "we have been surprised by this finding that the structure g2x2 - 3ti has the lowest binding energy among studied cases .",
    "this has motivated us to perform dft based molecular dynamics simulations of systems with different ti coverage densities to identify the ground state configurations that may have been overlooked and/or to support the aforementioned findings .",
    "the simulated systems consist of a 4x4 graphene supercell with 2 , 4 , 8 , and 16 ti adatoms , as displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_md](a - d ) .",
    "at the temperature of 500 k the different systems were allowed to evolve to more favourable states within a time window exceeding 1 ps .",
    "the system with the highest concentration coverage ( tic@xmath0 ) , with ti atoms initially placed above every hollow site , does not remain a monolayer crystal .",
    "however , something interesting happens : the ti atoms rearrange themselves so that they create one monolayer on the graphene surface with the same structure as g2x2 - 3ti while the redundant ti atoms create a second layer .    the systems with lower concentration of ti atoms per c atoms ( tic@xmath2 and tic@xmath6 , figs .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_md](b ) and [ fig_ti_g_md](c ) , respectively ) have also undergone structural changes .",
    "the separation of adsorbed ti atoms was too small to prevent atoms from mutual interaction .",
    "while adatoms remained adsorbed as a monolayer we have observed the creation of clusters and local rearangements .",
    "those structural changes occured despite the presence of the diffusion barrier for adatoms adsorbed on the hollow site ( clearly visible for tic@xmath2 , fig .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_md](b ) ) .",
    "again the comparison with the structure g2x2 - 3ti reveals remarkable similarities in local arrangements of ti adatoms , which is more pronounced in the structure tic@xmath6 ( fig . [",
    "fig_ti_g_md](c ) ) with higher adatom coverage .",
    "the last of the systems investigated using md calculations is the one with the lowest ti concentration - tic@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_md](a ) ) .",
    "we found that this case is the only one that maintained its structural properties during the md simulations .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_md](a ) the adsorbed atoms are separated by two carbon hexagonal rings . the separation distance of 6.5    is found to be sufficient to suppress the mutual adatom interaction observed in the previous cases .",
    "the ti atoms were trapped at the hollow sites and do not pass across the diffusion barrier .",
    "the aforementioned results of the md calculations can be summarized as follows : ( i ) ti atoms placed on a graphene surface can overcome diffusion barriers ( for the hollow site ) by mutual close range interaction ( up to @xmath8 ) , ( ii ) the maximal titanium monolayer coverage of graphene has stoichiometry ti@xmath1c@xmath2 and corresponds to the strucure g2x2 - 3ti ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_structures ] ) .",
    "experimentally @xcite a strong charge transfer from the ti layer to graphene was observed .",
    "charge population analysis performed on the investigated systems has revealed the same trend of strong to moderate charge transfer from the ti atoms to the underlying graphene for low and high concentrations , respectively .",
    "however , the quantitative and even qualitative values for charge transfer were found to be inconsistent among the different methods we used ( including the iterative hirshfeld charge population analysis , modified iterative hirshfeld method and the bader and voronoi cells charge population analysis ) .  @xcite    an alternative to obtain directly the charge transfer is by calculating the dipole moment after ti adsorption .",
    "however , the value of the electric dipole moment for the g2x2 - 3ti structure is 0.087 e , suggesting a small charge transfer from graphene to ti .",
    "this corresponds neither to the experimental observation of n - type doping , nor with the charge transfer analyses discussed above . as shown by the plane - averaged deformation electron density in fig .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_def_charge ] , the strong oscillations in the charge density do not clearly indicate actual charge transfer nor a dipole that will identify such transfer .",
    "the explanation for opposite total electric dipole moment lies in the dominant polarisation of the carbon layer induced by the positively charged chemisorbed ti monolayer .",
    "the surplus of charge located on the c atoms is shifted towards the ti atoms thus creating a dipole moment counteracting and exceeding the dipole moment based on the negative charge located on the carbon layer and the positively charged ti atoms .",
    "we expect that the polarisation of the carbon layer to be the probable reason for the inconsistent results obtained by the aforementioned charge population analysis methods .    .",
    "lattice constants and workfunctions .",
    "[ table_pristine_structures ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the direct charge transfer calculations proved to be insufficient in determinig the type of doping we also performed electronic band structure calculations and calculated the workfunction of the pristine and hybrid materials . as can be seen from the electronic band structure of the g2x2 - 3ti configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ti_g_bands ] ) , strong n - type doping occurs to graphene .",
    "the dirac cone , still present in the electronic band dispersion , is shifted by -2.61 ev below the fermi level .",
    "the calculation of the workfunction reveals the same type of doping , albeit in a partially counterintuitive way .",
    "as shown in table [ table_pristine_structures ] the work function of free - standing graphene is 4.49 ev , while the work function of an isolated hexagonal titanium monolayer is 4.72 ev . from a simple comparison of these values",
    "there is no precondition for charge transfer to occur from ti to the graphene substrate .",
    "however , for closely separated metal - graphene structures ( 2.1   for g2x2 - 3ti ) the chemical interaction prevails and is responsible for n - type doping even when the workfunction of the metal is larger than the graphene work function .",
    "@xcite in the final system the computed workfunctions on graphene ( 3.97 ev ) and titanium side ( 4.72 ev ) indicate a charge transfer to graphene .",
    "the workfunction difference increases as compared to the pristine values ( 0.81 ev compared to 0.23 ev ) .",
    "let us now consider the case of tio@xmath0 adsorption on graphene . as a model approach for studying the interaction of titanium dioxide on graphene surfaces we have chosen monolayer tio@xmath0 films derived from anatase , ( 101 ) with hexagonal and ( 001 ) with rectangular symmetry , which were proven to be stable .",
    "@xcite from the broad range of possible configurations the structure g2x2-hex - tio@xmath0 with lattice mismatch of about 4 % ( displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_tio2_g_structures](c ) ) was found to be the most stable .",
    "ti atoms are aranged in a monolayer triangular lattice , similar to the one found in the previously discussed structure g2x2 - 3ti , and oxygen atoms are placed between every three neighbouring ti atoms .",
    "the tio@xmath0 monolayer is buckled due to the alternating displacement of oxygen atoms above or below the plane of ti atoms .",
    "the other displayed model configurations in figs .",
    "[ fig_tio2_g_structures](a ) and [ fig_tio2_g_structures](b ) , while being metastable , will be discussed below as examples which lead to different doping properties .",
    "the charge population analysis performed on the tio@xmath0-graphene structures were found to be much more robust than for the titanium covered graphene .",
    "the bonds exhibit an ionic character with ti atoms gaining positive charge after loosing two electrons in favour of the o atoms .",
    "besides the charge redistribution in the tio@xmath0 layer the g2x2-hex - tio@xmath0 structure shows also p - type doping of the graphene layer .",
    "the amount of charge transfered from graphene , calculated with iterative hirshfeld charge population analysis , is 0.126 e per tio@xmath0 unit .",
    "the character of the doping is also visible in the electronic band structure shown in fig . [ fig_tio2_g_bands ] with a clear hole doping of graphene and a shift of the dirac cone above the fermi level by 0.5 ev .",
    "the observed doping can be explained from geometrical arguments .",
    "the bounded oxygen and titanium atoms can induce p- or n - type doping when close to the graphene surface .",
    "the tio@xmath0 monolayer in the g2x2-hex - tio@xmath0 structure can be seen as consisting of three layers  a titanium layer sandwiched between two oxygen layers , thus exposing oxygen atoms to graphene .",
    "similar charge transfers have been observed at the interface between graphene and rutile tio@xmath0 ( 110 ) , where hole doping in graphene and an accompanying shift of the fermi level relative to the dirac cone was observed .",
    "@xcite    the aforementioned reasoning proves to be valid also for the other systems we have investigated .",
    "the model structures in figs . [ fig_tio2_g_structures](a ) and [ fig_tio2_g_structures](b ) differ by the amount of oxygen or titanium atoms they expose to the graphene surface .",
    "the charge population analysis as well as the electronic band structure provide consistent evidence of p- or n - type doping depending on whether oxygen or titanium atoms are closer to the carbon atoms , respectively .",
    "the shift of the dirac cone with respect to the fermi level is -1.69 ev for g2x2-aligned hex - tio@xmath0 and 0 ev for g - sq8-tio@xmath0 structure , and the amount of charge , calculated with iterative hirshfeld method , transfered from graphene is -0.452 e and 0.026 e , respectively .",
    "recently it was found experimentally that the graphene gate dependent conductivity can be recovered after oxidation of adsorbed ti atoms .",
    "@xcite this recovery can be explained with the autocompensation of the titanium dioxide surface  @xcite exposed to graphene .",
    "we showed above that tio@xmath0 structures can induce both p- or n - type doping in graphene thus opening the possibility of mutual compensation of the doping effects .",
    "although the groundstate tio@xmath0 monolayer induces hole doping to graphene the performed calculations suggest that metastable states of tio@xmath0 monolayers can be responsible for the recovery of the graphene gate dependent conductivity .",
    "however , the geometrical nature of the autocompensation does not imply the actual presence of the above considered monolayer tio@xmath0 crystals on the graphene surface in the experiment .",
    "existence of any tio@xmath0 nanostructure with both p- or n - type doping sides exposed to the graphene surface will lead to similar effects .",
    "we have demonstrated strong n - type doping of ti covered graphene . while the various charge population analysis methods failed to provide reasonable quantitative results for the shift of the dirac point with respect to the fermi level our investigation of the increased difference of the work functions ( @xmath9 ) provided a consistent picture of the character of",
