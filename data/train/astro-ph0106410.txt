    "supermassive black holes have been convincingly detected in the centers of some nearby galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "kormendy & gebhardt ( 2001 , hereafter kg2001 ) gave a comprehensive review of recent black hole discoveries made with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) . a tight correlation between black hole mass and bulge velocity dispersion",
    "is confirmed .",
    "they noticed that black hole mass correlates with the luminosity of `` pseudobulges '' in disk galaxies , elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disk galaxies , but is independent of the luminosity of galaxy disks .",
    "the correlation strongly suggests a causal connection between the formation and evolution of the black hole and the bulge but the nature of this connection remains unknown .",
    "it is interesting to check whether this correlation still applies to both larger and smaller spherical systems .",
    "we may even speculate whether the correlation extends to systems with dispersion as low as that of globular clusters , since the globular clusters are also self - gravitating spherical systems similar to galactic bulges . using the m@xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 correlation , a crude estimate for the possible black hole mass in globular clusters can be obtained . for a typical massive globular cluster having a dispersion of the order of 10 kms@xmath2 , a black hole mass of about 2@xmath3m@xmath4 is expected . in certain galaxies ,",
    "the black hole directly reveals itself through its associated accretion and activity .",
    "such activity can hardly happen in globular clusters due to shortage of gas .",
    "however , recent x - ray observations of several starburst galaxies ( e.g. m82 , ngc 4038/39 ) reveal the existence of intermediate - mass black hole in starburst regions which are related to the formation of globular clusters ( kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; matsumoto et al . 2001 ; fabbiano , zezas , & murray 2001 ) .",
    "the presence of a black hole in a globular cluster affects the stellar density profile and the central stellar dynamics . with the dynamical detection sensitivity currently available ,",
    "black hole mass as low as 1000 m@xmath4 can hardly be identified ( van der marel 2001 ) .",
    "so far , the only example was presented by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for m15 which may possibly host a black hole of the order of 10@xmath5 m@xmath4 .",
    "gebhardt et al . ( 2000 ) inferred the projected velocity dispersion profile from @xmath61800 member stars in m15 with known line - of - light velocities . assuming isotropic velocity distribution , a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio ( m / l)@xmath7=1.7 and no rotation , the best spherical dynamical model that matches the data contains a 2000m@xmath4 black hole ( see fig.15 in gebhardt et al . 2000 ) .",
    "however , other models also explain the data , such as the models presented by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . to draw a firm conclusion on this issue ,",
    "further studies are needed .    if the globular clusters are eventually found to possess central black holes , as hinted in gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , it is interesting to investigate the correlation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion among globular clusters . taking the projected velocity dispersion at effective radius 9.0@xmath80.7kms@xmath2 and assuming a black hole with mass of 2000m@xmath4 , m15 can be plotted into the m@xmath0  @xmath9 diagram . in fig .",
    "1 , the solid line defined by @xmath10 is the best fit to the galaxies . within the uncertainties",
    ", m15 is perfectly sitting on the lower extension of the fit ! adding m15 to kg2001 data , a robust m@xmath0 ",
    "@xmath9 correlation in a much larger range can be given as @xmath11 which is shown by dash line in fig .",
    "1 . should the globular clusters and galaxies follow similar physical process of black hole formation , they would exhibit the same correlation between black hole mass and velocity dispersion .",
    "based on the data of globular clusters and galaxies , the determination of the m@xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 correlation would be improved significantly .",
    "bearing in mind that black hole mass correlates only with velocity dispersion or luminosity of the self - gravitating spherical systems , a bold speculation arises that the formation and growth of black hole can be linked with a certain potential physical process that is universal for such systems , and hence various sizes of self - gravitating systems satisfy the same correlation . with this speculation , the same m@xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 correlation should be found in a wide range of dimensions going from stellar globular clusters to galaxies . the black hole mass measurement by gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) shows that the globular cluster m15 is remarkably consistent with the m@xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 correlation derived from galaxies .",
    "this implies that the speculation might be applicable at least for globular clusters .",
    "adopting such a universal m@xmath0  @xmath1 correlation , the mass of the black hole in globular clusters can be estimated in terms of velocity dispersion . in table 1 , the parameters of 22 galactic and 9 m31 globular clusters are tabulated . according to the relation between the black hole mass and central velocity dispersion of galaxies , given by equation ( 5 ) in merritt & ferrarese ( 2001 ) ,",
    "the mass of black holes in those globular clusters is estimated .",
    "the results areand listed in column ( 6 ) of table 1 .",
    "the uncertainties are given following those of velocity dispersion data .",
    "for galaxies , black hole mass also correlates with bugle luminosity .",
    "such a correlation is expected yet to present in globular clusters .",
    "the luminosity of globular clusters is plotted against black hole mass in fig .",
    "2 . the solid line gives the best fit of galaxies by kg2001 .",
    "the globular clusters fall around the solid line with a considerable scatter .",
    "this consistency reinforces the possibility that the globular clusters harbor black holes and satisfy the same m@xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 correlation as that of galaxies .",
