    "the past two decades have seen substantial improvements in our understanding of the demographics of nuclear supermassive black holes ( bhs ) , predominantly driven by the availability of bh mass measurements for nearby galaxies from dynamical techniques .",
    "the advent of the _ hubble space telescope _ has enabled a few dozen dynamical bh mass measurements , which reveal that supermassive bhs are ubiquitous components of bulge - dominated galaxy centers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , there appears to be a remarkably tight correlation between bh mass and bulge properties , including velocity dispersion ( the @xmath5  relation ; * ? ? ?",

    "we explore the demographics of a new sample of dynamical bh masses measured using observations of circumnuclear masers ( kuo , c.  y. et al . in prep . )",
    ".    apart from our own galactic center , where individual stars are used as test particles to weigh the bh ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the most precise bh masses are derived using water megamaser spots in a keplerian circumnuclear disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such megamasers are very close to an ideal dynamical tracer of the central mass at the galaxy center , as they delineate a disk with a well - measured keplerian rotation curve within fractions of a pc from the center .",
    "they are detectable when the disk is aligned within a few degrees of the line of sight .",
    "masers detected in edge - on nuclear disks have characteristic triple - peaked spectral profiles , making the disk inclination angle well - known in these cases @xcite .",
    "bh mass measurements based on the keplerian rotation curves of circumnuclear megamaser disks are not prone to the same systematic uncertainties as the dynamical methods based on optical observations . in the case of gas dynamical methods , it can be very difficult to determine the level of non - virial gas support ( e.g. ,  due to turbulence ) but neglecting these extra sources of support can lead to significant bias in the final result ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "stellar dynamical methods are sensitive to assumptions about galaxy anisotropy and radial variation in dark matter fraction that are not well constrained observationally in general ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the mcp aims to determine a precise independent hubble constant to a few percent accuracy @xcite .",
    "an important outcome of the mcp is that the keplerian megamaser disks also provide a precise measurement of the enclosed mass within a few tenths of a pc from the center of these spiral galaxies , dominated by a bh at the center , a valuable resource in its own right .",
    "the bh masses for seven maser galaxies are presented in kuo et al .",

    "the present paper examines the demographics of the new megamaser galaxies , focusing on the shape and scatter of bh - bulge relations for these galaxies .    to date",
    ", the vast majority of dynamical bh masses have been obtained in massive elliptical and s0 galaxies ( fig .",
    "1 ) . there are only five targets with bh mass measurements @xmath10  @xmath2  ( one of those being the milky way ) and there are only 11 spiral galaxies with hubble type of sa or later in the sample of 67 galaxies used in the most recent calibration of the @xmath5  relation ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) . the disproportionate representation of massive galaxies is easily understood .",
    "local elliptical galaxies are relatively dust - free , and the bhs are massive enough that we can resolve their gravitational spheres of influence at distances of tens of mpc .",
    "spiral galaxies tend to be dusty and star - forming , complicating dynamical measurements .",
    "our knowledge of bh demographics at low masses is rudimentary , such that the shape and scatter in bh - bulge scaling relations as well as the bh occupation fraction in spiral galaxies remain uncertain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the main focus of this work is to exploit the new sample of reliable bh masses afforded by the new maser studies to explore bh demographics for bhs with @xmath0@xmath11  @xmath2  in spiral galaxies .",
    "the paper starts with a description of the sample (  2 ) .",
    "we then describe the observations and data reduction (  3 ) and the spectroscopic (  4 ) and imaging (  5 ) analysis . in ",
    "6 we present the primary result of the paper , namely the location of the maser galaxies in the @xmath5  plane , while in  7 the scalings between @xmath0  and bulge luminosity / mass are briefly discussed .",
    "the impact of our results on our knowledge of bh demographics , particularly as probed with active galaxies , is discussed in  8 , and we summarize and conclude in  9 .",
    "throughout we assume the following cosmological parameters to calculate distances : @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "over the years there have been a number of searches for megamaser galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the map determines whether a maser is in a clean dynamical system or has more complicated structures such as outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper we present velocity dispersions both for the kuo et al .",
    "sample and two other objects , ngc 3393 @xcite and ic 2560 @xcite . in the latter case , while it is assumed that the systemic masers arise from the inner edge of the masing disk , without vlbi mapping the enclosed mass is uncertain by factors of a few .",
    "we expect better data will yield a concrete mass .",
    "the vlbi ( and thus mass constraints ) for the remaining seven objects are presented for the first time in c - y .",
    "kuo et al . in preparation .",
    "the details of the bh mass fitting are described in kuo et al . but are reviewed here briefly for completeness .",
    "the bh masses are derived by fitting a keplerian rotation curve to the positions and velocities of the maser spots .",
    "the distance is fixed using an assumed value of @xmath17 and the inclination of the maser disk is assumed to be @xmath18 .",
    "all of the megamaser disks for which we have measured an inclination are within @xmath19 of being perfectly edge - on , so the inclination contributes less than a @xmath20 error to the measurement of the black hole mass . in ngc 4388",
    "we could not measure a disk inclination , but even if the disk is @xmath21 from edge - on , the contribution to the error in the bh mass would be only @xmath22 , which is comparable to the bh mass error caused by the distance uncertainty ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "ongoing monitoring of the most promising targets will allow the measurement of accelerations in the systemic features .",
    "joint modeling of @xmath0  and distance for these targets will lead to a tighter constraint on each ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is interesting to note that the bh masses are strongly clustered around @xmath11  @xmath2 .",
    "we suspect that this is a simple consequence of picking random galaxies from the local active - galaxy mass function . without accounting for incompleteness",
    ", the observed active mass function is strongly peaked at a mass @xmath11  @xmath2(e.g .",
    "* ) . at higher mass , there are very few systems radiating at an appreciable fraction of their eddington limit and we are woefully incomplete at lower mass @xcite . while we do not sample the full range of bh masses in the local universe with this sample , our selection is unbiased with respect to bulge mass and velocity dispersion and thus does not invalidate our results .",
    "the megamaser galaxies are found predominantly in early - to - mid  type spiral galaxies , ranging in hubble type from s0 ( e.g. , ngc 1194 ) to sb ( e.g. , ngc 4388 ) .",

    ", we used the boller & chivens ( b&c ) spectrograph with the 600 lines  mm@xmath13 grating and the 2  slit , which yielded an instrumental resolution of @xmath26  km  s@xmath13  and a wavelength coverage of @xmath27   , covering the 4000  break , the g - band at 4304 , h@xmath28+[]@xmath29 , the @xmath30@xmath31 triplet , and ( in most cases ) h@xmath25 .",
    "we observed at two slit positions ( table 1 ) for the majority of the galaxies , both along the major and minor axis , at the lowest possible airmass to mitigate differential refraction .",

    "these observations were performed at the galaxy major axis only .",
    "we also present one calcium triplet  @xmath34 ( cat ) measurement , based on a red setting with a central wavelength of 8540  (8000 - 9100  ) and comparable instrumental resolution .",
    "the reduction of both the dis and b&c data proceeded in a similar fashion .",
    "flat - fielding , bias - subtraction , and wavelength calibration were performed within iraf . in the case of the b&c data ,",
    "flux calibration and telluric correction was also performed within iraf , using ltt 3218 , ltt 3864 , ltt 6248 , hilt 600 , ltt 3218 , feige 56 , and cd 32 as flux calibrator stars in order to match the airmass and time of observation .",
    "flux calibration and telluric correction of the dis data used idl routines as described by @xcite . in this case",
    "we used feige 34 as the flux calibrator . in the appendix",
    "we compare the [ ] luminosities between two independent data sets and demonstrate that our flux calibration is good to @xmath35 .    the proper physical aperture used to calibrate the @xmath5  relation remains a matter of debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and at present robust @xmath36 measurements are only available for a small fraction of the maser sample .",
    "thus , we have chosen to extract spectra with apertures ranging from the resolution limit of the observations ( @xmath37 ) to the s / n limit of the spectra ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "typically the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio is optimized with apertures of @xmath39 .",
    "the resulting dispersion in @xmath6  values is included in the error budget , and is @xmath40 .",
    "we use direct - pixel fitting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to measure stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "the stellar templates are broadened and fitted in pixel rather than fourier space . -0.05 in -0 mm this method is computationally expensive relative to fourier methods ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for one thing , it is easier to incorporate noise arrays directly . of particular importance to active galaxies , arbitrary regions of the spectrum ( such as narrow emission lines ) may be masked in a straightforward manner without introducing spurious signals into the final results .",
    "the details of the code used here are described in @xcite and @xcite . in short ,",
    "each spectrum is modeled as the linear combination of template stars @xmath41 that are shifted to zero velocity , broadened by a gaussian , @xmath42 , with width @xmath43 and diluted by a constant [ or power - law if necessary ; @xmath44 .",
    "finally , the entire model is multiplied by a polynomial [ @xmath45 ; typically third order ] to account for intrinsic spectral differences , reddening , and errors in flux calibration : @xmath46 + c(\\lambda ) \\}\\ ] ] the nonlinear levenberg - marquardt algorithm , as implemented by mpfit in idl @xcite , is used to minimize @xmath47  in pixel space between the galaxy and the model .",
    "we have a library of template stars observed with the b&c spectrograph . for the fitting we use the following stars : hd 36634 ( g6 iii ) , hd 129505 ( g8 iiii ) , hd 126571 ( k0 iii ) ,",
    "hip 70788 ( k3 iii ) , and hd 131903 ( a9 v ) .",
    "for the apo observations , our spectral library is much more limited , and we have only one reliable velocity template star .",
    "thus , we utilize a large library of high - s / n , high - spectral resolution ( @xmath48  km  s@xmath13 ) stellar templates from @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use the following stars : hd 26574 ( f2 ii - iii ) , hd 107950 ( g6 iii ) , hd 18322 ( k1 iii ) , and hd 131507 ( k4 iii ) . in order to translate the measured dispersion to the true dispersion , we first measure the instrumental dispersion of the dis spectra using arc lines ( 52  km  s@xmath13 ) , which yields a quadrature difference of @xmath49  km  s@xmath13between the dis and valdes spectra .",
    "we also measure the dispersion of the dis velocity template using a valdes star of the same spectral type and find @xmath50  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the consistency of the two methods is reassuring .",
    "thus , the final dispersion is simply @xmath51 .",
    "note that because we use stellar templates observed with an identical instrumental set - up , we need apply no corrections to the b&c spectra .    given our spectral coverage , the most robust spectral features with high enough equivalent width ( ew ) for dispersion measurements are either the @xmath30  triplet or the g - band .",
    "we avoid the ca  h+k  features because they are highly sensitive to spectral type , occur in a spectral region with a strong continuum discontinuity , and may be contaminated by interstellar absorption ( see review in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the @xmath30  features are in many cases contaminated by emission from [ ] @xmath52    and [ ]  @xmath53   .",
    "furthermore , differences in the @xmath25/fe ratios between the template stars ( from the solar neighborhood ) and external galaxies will lead to systematic errors in @xmath6  measurements from this region @xcite .",
    "for these reasons , we focus on the g - band region for the velocity dispersion measurements .",
    "we have multiple slit positions for most of the dupont spectra . in table 2",
    "we present measurements for each slit position with the @xmath54 aperture , but we also present the weighted mean of the two , and use that value in all subsequent work .",
    "example fits are shown in figure 2 while the dispersions are presented in table 2 .",
    "there are literature measurements available for a limited number of targets in our sample .",
    "direct comparison can be tricky ; the dispersions may be highly aperture dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , in general we find decent agreement with the literature values , as summarized in figure 3 .",
    "two targets ( ngc 2273 , ngc 4388 ) appear in the recent atlas of stellar velocity dispersions measured for the palomar spectroscopic survey of nearby galaxies @xcite , taken with a comparable @xmath55 aperture @xcite .",

    "note that our observation is only marginally spectrally resolved . however , our sdss measurement , presented in the appendix , is @xmath60 , giving us some confidence in this result .",
    "other literature comparisons for these two targets are presented in @xcite .",
    "two other galaxies ( ngc 3393 and ic 2560 ) were observed by @xcite with a @xmath61 slit .",
    "again , the measurements agree within the quoted errors . in the case of ic 2560 , we find @xmath62  km  s@xmath13  along the major axis compared to their @xmath63  km  s@xmath13 , while for ngc 3393 we find @xmath64  km  s@xmath13  along the major axis and @xmath65  km  s@xmath13  along the minor axis , as compared to @xmath66  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "ngc 3393 is also presented by @xcite measured within a @xmath67 extraction .",
    "they find @xmath68  km  s@xmath13 , which is marginally consistent with our minor - axis measurement .",
    "one convenient by - product of our @xmath6  measurement technique is a pure emission - line spectrum that has been corrected for underlying absorption lines ( e.g. , h@xmath28 ) . since the narrow emission lines ( particularly [ ] ) represent one of the only methods for estimating bolometric luminosities for these obscured objects , we describe the measurements here .",
    "the fitting routines are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we fit the [ ] @xmath69 lines with sums of up to four gaussians .",
    "the two lines are restricted to have identical shapes and the velocity difference and relative strengths are fixed to laboratory values ( 3.1 in the latter case ) .",
    "the h@xmath28  line is fitted independently with the sum of two gaussians ( which is always completely sufficient given the typical signal - to - noise ratio , s / n , in this line ) .",
    "we also calculate the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the summation of all components in the [ ]  model .",
    "the velocity offsets between individual components are small compared to the total line width , so the fwhm is well - defined . to bracket systematic uncertainties",
    ", we measure the line width in the spectra from the 4and 10  apertures and the error bar represents the difference in those two widths .    for the majority of the b&c spectra , as well as the dis observation of ngc 6323 , we also model the h@xmath25 + [ ]  complex .",
    "ideally we would use measurements of the [ ]  line width as a model to deblend h@xmath25  from [ ] .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , in this case we simply describe each narrow line with the same combination of gaussians , fix the relative strengths of the [ ] @xmath70    lines to 1:2.96 , and fix the relative wavelengths of all three lines to their laboratory values . in the case of ngc 4388 ,",
    "we further include a broad component fixed to have the same fwhm as reported by @xcite , but we are not sensitive to the presence of weak broad lines in the other objects .",
    "we derive an intrinsic reddening correction for [ ]  using the h@xmath28  and h@xmath25  fluxes when available , but do not apply it to the fluxes .",
    "all the line measurements are summarized in table 3 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the [ ]  luminosities as an isotropic indicator of the agn luminosity . estimating robust bolometric luminosities in these objects",
    "is complicated since megamaser systems are found preferentially in obscured active galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "are compton thick ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) although concerns about reddening remain ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shape and equivalent width ( ew ) of the fe k@xmath25 line at 6.7 kev are also sensitive to the intrinsic luminosity and inclination of the obscuring material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a few cases , detailed modeling of the fe k@xmath25 lines have been performed , which yields an independent estimate of the bolometric luminosities @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite argue for the use of the [ ]  @xmath72 emission line as a higher - fidelity tracer of agn bolometric luminosity ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "since this bolometric correction was derived without correction for internal reddening , we do not deredden either , but tabulate the proper correction for reference and comparison with the other indicators .",
    "the estimated eddington ratios range from @xmath74@xmath75 . including internal reddening would change the values by 0.6 dex at most .",
    "there are only two objects with estimated bolometric luminosities from the fe k@xmath25 line ( excluding ic 2560 for the moment ) , also shown in table 3 .",
    "there are also three cases with [ ] measurements in the literature ; we have converted to bolometric luminosity using the calibration of j.  rigby et al . in preparation .",
    "as expected , @xmath76 ( [ ] ) tends to be higher than @xmath76 ( [ ] ) , but the number of objects is too small to draw definite conclusions about the average magnitude of this effect , or how directly it is related to our internal reddening estimates .      the presence or absence of young stellar populations in the bulge regions of these galaxies provide important clues as to their growth and evolution (  5.3 ) .",
    "the spectra provide useful constraints on stellar ages , although the modeling is complicated by the narrow emission lines that litter the spectrum .",

    "the only ambiguous case is ngc 4388 .",
    "they find that @xmath82 of the luminosity comes from this young component , while we do not find compelling evidence for a young component .",
    "in fact , ngc 4388 is quite difficult to model , both because it is extincted and because the emission lines have very high equivalent widths .",
    "those galaxies ( ngc 2273 , ugc 3789 , and ngc 6323 ) that we observed with apo do not have the blue coverage needed to constrain the stellar populations . in the case of ngc 2273 , young stars associated with an inner ring are well - documented @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have much information for the other two .",
    "the bulge color of ngc 6323 , @xmath83 ( see below ) , is typical for an early - type spiral galaxy @xcite , suggesting that either there is not much star formation and/or that there is a considerable quantity of dust .",
    "overall we find evidence for ongoing or recent star formation in roughly half of the sample .",
    "as discussed briefly in  2 , the velocity dispersion profiles of late - type spirals can be complicated by kinematically cold , disk - like components as well as bars or other non - axisymmetries . as a result",
    ", it is impossible to pick a single , well - motivated aperture size , and the long - slit data presented here are not deep enough to derive robust rotation curves .",
    "we can say that the measured dispersions do not change by more than @xmath84 over the range of radii we probe , and this spread in values is included in the error budget .",
    "robust @xmath36 measurements are needed to define the optimal radius of extraction for each galaxy .",
    "along similar lines , it is possible that the slit orientation relative to that of the bar might impact @xmath6(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , for the objects with both minor and major axis spectra , we see at most a 40% difference in the two measurements .",

    "thus , the masers were selected first by virtue of their galaxy luminosity and then based on emission - line ratios and we do not expect a large selection bias based on nuclear activity .",
    "a more serious concern is that we do not see a representative snapshot of the galaxy population when focusing on accreting bhs .",
    "active bhs have not necessarily reached their final masses , and thus may be growing towards the inactive @xmath5  relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the bhs presented here are radiating at @xmath40 of their eddington limits , and thus would need @xmath153 gyr to grow onto the inactive relation .",
    "this is somewhat long compared to the @xmath11  year lifetimes typically estimated for quasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "typical growth times for pseudobulges , in contrast , are probably many gyr ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , the notion that these particular bhs knew to accrete material at this moment in order to move towards the inactive relation seems somewhat contrived . in addition , we plot @xmath114  against eddington ratio in figure 10_b_. there is no correlation between these two quantities ( kendall s @xmath128 , probability of no correlation is @xmath129 ) .",
    "we see no evidence that the maser galaxies provide a biased tracer of bh - bulge scaling relations .",
    "we consider the host galaxy properties of a new sample of active galaxies with megamaser disks .",
    "fitting of the maser spots yields bh masses with @xmath154 precision ( c.  y.  kuo et al . in preparation ) .",
    "bh mass measurements in the maser galaxies more than double the sample of galaxies with dynamical bh masses of @xmath0@xmath155  @xmath2 , as well as increasing significantly the number of spiral galaxies with dynamical bh mass measurements .",
    "our primary results are as follows :    1 .",
    "there is a population of spiral galaxies , probed by the maser measurements , with bhs that systematically lie below the @xmath5  relation of massive elliptical galaxies . as a result",
    ", the @xmath5  relation fits to later - type and lower - mass galaxies display both a larger scatter and lower zeropoint than fits to elliptical galaxies alone (  6 ) .",
    "there is no universal power - law @xmath5  relation .",
    "2 .   from our limited data set , the galaxies appear to obey scalings between @xmath0  and bulge luminosity or mass . on the other hand @xmath0does",
    "not correlate strongly with total galaxy luminosity for the maser galaxies (  7 ) .",
    "3 .   to rule out definitively the presence of small classical bulges buried in the bars , dust , and young stellar populations found at the centers of these galaxies , we require spatially resolved kinematics and high - resolution imaging , which will fully characterize the complicated bulge regions of these galaxies . 4 .",
    "changes in the @xmath5  relation at low mass translate directly into uncertainties in the local bh mass function for @xmath0@xmath156  @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , they imply ambiguity in the overall scaling of bh masses in active galaxies based on reverberation mapping .",
    "we now indulge in speculation about the physical ramifications of our results .",
    "generic arguments about bh self - regulation , taken at face value , seem to predict a simple power - law relationship between @xmath0and @xmath6  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the shape and scatter of the relation may depend on @xmath0(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this relation is established when the bhs grow large enough that their accretion power can overcome the galaxy potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the maser galaxies have systematically lower bh masses at a fixed @xmath6 . perhaps",
    "because of the quiescent history of these spiral galaxies , there has never been a major feeding episode in the past history of their bhs .",
    "if low - mass galaxies do not feed their bhs very effectively , then the bh never approaches the `` limiting '' value set by the galaxy potential @xcite . presumably the same processes that make a galaxy into an elliptical or spiral ( merging history ) also determine the bh feeding efficiency . in this scenario ,",
    "we expect a measurable difference in scatter between elliptical and spiral galaxies with @xmath0@xmath152  @xmath2 .",
    "we note that ongoing adaptive - optics  assisted integral - field unit observations are exploring the low - mass regime for elliptical galaxies with improved statistics @xcite , which will allow us to perform this test .",
    "alternatively , @xcite proposes that bh - bulge scaling relations are tightened at high mass due to multiple minor mergers , which , by the central limit theorem , yield a tight @xmath5  relation at the present day ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture",
    "the only important parameter is number of mergers , rather than detailed galaxy morphology .",
    "here we might expect to find increased scatter in both the elliptical and spiral galaxies at @xmath0@xmath125  @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to note , in passing , that one might also expect globular cluster frequency to correlate more tightly with @xmath0  than bulge luminosity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we might also expect this process to lower @xmath0/@xmath132 over cosmic time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this paper represents an initial exploration of scaling relations for the maser galaxies , but there are many experiments we would like to perform . as noted above , further observations are required to determine whether or not there are small classical bulges embedded in all of these galaxies , whose @xmath6  and @xmath157 correlate tightly with @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy would reveal the @xmath6  profile and allow us to determine whether there is a transition scale at which we recover a tight correlation between @xmath0and @xmath6 .",
    "multi - color photometry , ideally with _",
    "hst _  imaging of the nuclei , will allow us to decompose the light profile into its constituent parts , measure stellar masses for each , and then determine whether the bh mass correlates best with any particular combination of components .",
    "there are other potentially interesting bh - bulge scaling relation projections to investigate as well .",
    "for instance , it may be that @xmath0  correlates more tightly with the dynamical mass than @xmath6or stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "there is also a suggestion in the literature that @xmath0  actually correlates with the dark matter halo mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although there are clearly complications in spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "at present only a couple of the galaxies have resolved rotation curves , but we will obtain observations of the entire sample with the evla in order to investigate both the gas content and the @xmath0-@xmath158 correlation in these galaxies .    beyond the present work",
    "there are now many suggestions that the @xmath5  relation may not be the unbroken , low - scatter power - law originally proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the larger samples available to date ,",
    "the scatter has increased by @xmath159 dex @xcite . at the same time , new analysis incorporating the impact of dark matter at large radius @xcite has shown that the bh masses in the most massive ellipticals may be systematically underestimated by a factor of @xmath160 .",
    "finally , new dynamical models incorporating triaxiality may well increase the scatter in bh mass at a fixed bulge mass as well ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given that there is no universal @xmath5  relation , it may be time to revist the role the bhs play in galaxy evolution .    + 0.5truein 1.8 in -0 mm in addition to the b&c data discussed in the primary text , we obtained auxiliary spectra for some of the southern targets in one magellan / baade night .",
    "we used the inamori - magellan areal camera & spectrograph ( imacs ; * ? ? ? * ) with the 1200 l  mm@xmath13 grating .",
    "the primary setting had a tilt of 17.15 with a resulting central wavelength of 4540   , a spectral range of 3800 - 5300  , and a dispersion of @xmath161  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "we also obtained cat  observations for two targets , with a tilt of 32.8 , a resulting central wavelength of 8340   , and a spectral range of 7500 - 9000  .",
    "the observing conditions were not optimal ; it was only four days from full moon , and the typical seeing ranged from 07 to 14 over the course of the night .",
    "imacs consists of an array of four by two ccds with considerable tilt in the spatial direction .",
    "therefore we used the cosmos code developed by g. oemler , d. kelson , and g. walth to reduce long - slit imacs data .",
    "the cosmos code has a variety of benefits over standard long - slit reductions of the imacs data .",
    "for one thing , because the size of the chip gaps is built into the code , we are able to solve for a global ( rather than a chip - by - chip ) wavelength solution in a straightforward manner .",
    "furthermore , the code contains an optical model for the instrument and thus does a better job of modeling curvature in the spatial direction .",
    "we perform bias - subtraction , flat - fielding , dispersion - correction , and rectification within cosmos and then use standard iraf routines for tracing and extracting one - dimensional spectra , including sky subtraction . finally , we use idl routines as described by @xcite to perform flux calibration and telluric absorption corrections .",
    "in addition to the imacs spectra , three targets ( ngc 1194 , ngc 4388 , and ngc 6264 ) have spectra in the sdss database .",
    "these have a spectral resolution of @xmath162  km  s@xmath13(e.g .",
    "* ) and completely cover the g - band region .",
    "we use valdes template stars for the sdss spectra as well as the dis spectra .",
    "the velocity dispersion measurements proceeded as above , except that our library of template stars taken with imacs is limited to g and k giants .",
    "thus we use a large library of template stars provided by the elodie catalog @xcite .",
    "these stars were observed with @xmath163 or @xmath164  km  s@xmath13  resolution . in all cases",
    "we adopt the following stars as our templates : hd025457 ( f5  v ) , hd148856 ( g8  iii ) , hd185351 ( k0  iii ) , and hd124897 ( k1.5  iii ) .",
    "we fit our internal velocity dispersion templates with the elodie stars in order to determine the relative broadening between the two systems . in the case of imacs",
    "the spectral resolution varies significantly as a function of wavelength , but in the range @xmath165   , fits to the imacs stars with the elodie templates yield a relative dispersion of @xmath166  km  s@xmath13 . as an additional consistency check ,",
    "we take our measured dispersions from the internal velocity stars and compare them to those measured with the elodie stars in the identical wavelength range , where the latter are corrected for the resolution difference in quadrature .",
    "the result of that test is shown in figure 14 .",
    "the agreement is completely satisfactory , with a fractional difference of @xmath167 .",
    "we are reassured both that there is no significant systematic offset between the two sets of measurements and that the scatter is considerably smaller than any other source of uncertainty .",
    "overall , we find satisfactory agreement between the imacs and b&c measurements ( table a5 ) .",
    "the one exception is the galaxy ngc 3393 . in this case ,",
    "our imacs data were not taken along the major axis , but rather at pa=12@xmath168 .",
    "since the imacs measurement is nominally consistent with our minor axis measurement , we suspect this pa difference may at least partially explain the discrepancy .",
    "furthermore , we are able to test our flux calibration by comparing the fluxes in [ ]  between the two sets of observations",
    ". since we can match approximately the slit size and position angle , any discrepancies should predominantly reflect differences in flux calibration .",
    "it is reassuring that our measurements agree within @xmath169 in all cases but ngc 2960 , where the [ ]  line falls on a noisy part of the imacs chip .                                                                              ,",
