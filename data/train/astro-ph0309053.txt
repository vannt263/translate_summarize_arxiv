    "although there are examples of blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies which appear optically to consist of a current starburst with no underlying population of older stars ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , the majority of bcds consist of an intense starburst embedded in a low surface brightness ( lsb ) envelope of previous generation stars @xcite . for a general review of bcds and",
    "the possibly related galaxies , see @xcite . for our purposes , the term `` bcd '' refers to galaxy morphology regardless of galaxy size or luminosity , in the spirit of the morphological classification in the virgo cluster catalog ( vcc ) of @xcite .",
    "the collection of bcds in the vcc , even after objects with later - determined redshifts that place them in the background of the cluster are removed , is admittedly a heterogeneous sample ; however , it is useful to consider the set as a whole before finer distinctions are drawn among the objects .",
    "one important question is how the size of the optically luminous region compares to the envelope ; what fraction of the reservoir is involved in the starbursts , present or past ?",
    "the profile widths from single beam arecibo data for the vcc bcds are consistent with those for sm and i m galaxies of the same total luminosity , but the optical diameters of the bcds are smaller by a factor of 2 or 3 @xcite .",
    "we would like to know if the is similarly concentrated by comparison to other irregular galaxies of similar total mass .",
    "in particular , prior observations have not told us what fraction of bcds have extents greatly exceeding the diameter of the region that has formed stars [ pertinent to the question of whether or not envelopes of bcds contribute significantly to the lyman limit systems ( lls ) seen in absorption in qso spectra ] ; in those cases where the does exceed the optical extent by more than a factor of 2 it is still not clear whether the outlying gas is primordial and still infalling , distended by a blow - out from the central star - burst , or due to tidal interactions or ram - pressure sweeping .",
    "galaxies are identified by pronounced optical wavelength emission lines similar to those from galactic regions while bcds are identified by their morphology in photographic images ( and we exclude from consideration those bcds which were subsequently found to have redshifts that place them far in the background of virgo ) .",
    "identification solely by emission lines also produces a heterogeneous set of objects , and one point of inquiry is to what extent the two sets ( bcds and galaxies ) overlap .",
    "are external interactions responsible for the starbursts , either in the form of infalling clouds or tidal interactions with other nearby galaxies ?",
    "the latter question has been addressed by mapping with various resolutions , mainly for field bcds and galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , with largely inconclusive results .",
    "the bcds in and around the virgo cluster are particularly interesting in this regard , since they are distributed among the several groups and subclusters , presumably at different stages of interaction with the rest of the cluster . are there subtle tidal effects due to the neighboring galaxies or due to the group potential , even though no evidence of dependence of star formation rates on virgocentric distance can be found @xcite ?",
    "an effective strategy for assessing the prevalence of this phenomenon is to use arecibo observatory for cursory mapping of the surroundings of all vcc bcds with redshifts in the range of the virgo cluster .",
    "only 6 of the 35 vcc bcds ( with redshifts in the virgo cluster range ) have mapping reported prior to this paper @xcite . here",
    "we add arecibo mapping for another five , an installment toward a sample sufficiently complete to answer the questions raised above .",
    "the objects found to have outlying emission in our arecibo mapping are primarily those with the largest optical diameters , the largest single - beam fluxes , and the largest profile widths .",
    "consequently we undertook to extend the sample of vcc bcds mapped at the very large array to include the 5 largest bcds ( along with one smaller object for which arecibo mapping indicated outlying gas and one bcd in leo ) .",
    "we sought to integrate long enough to acquire detailed mapping of the outer regions of the disk down to a column density @xmath0 of a few @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the low spatial resolution mapping at arecibo was designed to look for any very extended appendages down to even lower column density .",
    "ionization of hydrogen by extragalactic uv is thought to be important only for @xmath3 , and recent detections of `` mini - high velocity clouds '' with peak column densities well below @xmath4 @xmath2 @xcite may suggest even lower critical column densities for ionization . a significant contribution to low redshift lls from bcds would be detectable .",
    "our velocity range should have been adequate to detect any outlying clouds ( or -rich , optically faint dwarf companions ) associated with these galaxies , should they exist .    in sect .",
    "2 we give the details of the arecibo mapping , and the vla parameters follow in sect .",
    "the results from both sets of observations are presented in sect .",
    "4 , along with a comparison of the maps for objects mapped at both observatories .",
    "a few preliminary theoretical considerations are discussed in sect . 5 , followed by conclusions and a summary in sect . 6",
    "our mapping of the environs of five virgo cluster bcds was conducted as a commissioning phase project at the upgraded arecibo observatory in july / august 1998 .",
    "we used the gregorian feed system with the `` l narrow '' receiver in total power ( position - switched ) mode , with 6.10 khz ( about 1.3  km  @xmath5 ) channel spacing .",
    "calibration was accomplished by observing several continuum sources from the vla calibrator list , chosen to have small size compared to the @xmath6 beam .",
    "in addition , we reobserved several spiral galaxies for which we had high signal - to - noise pre - upgrade measurements and which were known to be @xmath7 in extent .",
    "each bcd was mapped with pointed on / off observations at the optical center and in a hexagon spaced @xmath6 away .",
    "the orientation of each hexagon is given by the axis - crossings of the spectra in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "one object , mk  1263 = fs  32 ( i.e. , number 32 in the list presented by @xcite ) , was also observed at positions twice as far out from the center . for the most part",
    ", we observed each point in a single 5 min ( on ) scan , but each point around vcc  0022 was observed for twice that amount of time . since these observations spanned sundown and the tie - down system at arecibo had not yet been brought on - line , baselines were not always as smooth as users have come to expect for nighttime observations .",
    "none of the mapped objects was extended enough for sidelobes to contribute significantly to the @xmath6 ring , but the @xmath8 points around mk  1263 may be receiving some sidelobe emission from the center .    for each spectrum , we removed a low - order polynomial baseline and measured the flux integrated over the full width of the feature and the profile widths at 50% , 80% and 20% of the peak of the spectrum . the results for the central spectrum are reported in table 1 , along with the systemic heliocentric velocity @xmath9 defined to be the midpoint between the 50% points on opposite sides of the central spectrum .",
    "we estimated a total flux for each galaxy by integrating spatially over the galaxy as detailed in @xcite .",
    "the type listed in table 1 is that recorded for each galaxy in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we selected as candidates for vla mapping all vcc bcds with flux @xmath10 jy - km @xmath5 , optical diameter @xmath11 06 , and single beam profile width @xmath12 km @xmath5 , a total of 5 objects .",
    "adding one smaller object and one object in the leo group , both known from arecibo mapping to be extended , brought us to a total sample of 7 bcds for which we sought high dynamic range d array mapping . in all , the vla - mapped vcc bcds are brighter in @xmath13 by 1.2 mag , larger in optical diameter by a factor of 1.7 , and brighter in flux by a factor of 4.0 than the vcc bcds that have not yet been mapped .",
    "spectral line mapping using 27 antennas in the d array of the very large array was conducted on 1999 may 28 - 30 .",
    "observational details are given in table 2 .",
    "online hanning smoothing was employed , and calibration was accomplished using sources 1219 + 285 ( b1950 ) and 3c286 from the vla calibrator list .",
    "the data were calibrated and editted using standard tasks in the astronomical image processing system ( classic aips ) .",
    "continuum subtraction was done in the @xmath14 plane via uvbas , and maps were made and cleaned using imagr with zero - spacing fluxes estimated from our arecibo map and with robustness set equal to 0 .",
    "after imaging , the data cube was corrected for the vla primary beam .",
    "the mk  1263 field in fact contained four galaxies within the vla primary beam : the bcd mk  1263 itself , the sm - imiv pair cgcg  66 - 29 = fs  35 and fs  36 , and ( near the edge of the primary beam ) the sa(s)c galaxy ngc  3389 , all within the observed velocity range .",
    "results are presented for three of the four ( fs  36 was not detected ; see sect .",
    "vcc  0010 , 0024 , 0172 , 0459 and 1437 were all isolated within their primary beams , but the vcc  0340 field also contained vcc  0329 , a 16.8 mag ( b ) imv ?",
    "galaxy , and vcc  0379 , a very faint galaxy of uncertain morphology with no previous redshift measurement of any kind . to our surprise , both vcc  0329 and vcc  0379 were detected in this field .",
    "for each of the galaxies in the seven vla fields , we display in figs .",
    "3 - 24 a velocity - integrated emission map ( contours ) superimposed on a greyscale optical image from the digitized sky survey ( hereafter dss ) , a velocity field from the first moment of the cube , and a panel of contour maps of the individual channels bearing significant flux .",
    "the spatially - integrated spectra are displayed in fig .",
    "we mapped 5 bcds at arecibo .",
    "significant emission was seen in beams @xmath6 away from the center in 3 of those cases ( mk  1263 , vcc  0024 and vcc  1437 ) ; in 2 cases ( mk  1263 and vcc  0024 ) there is a clear velocity separation between points @xmath6 from center on opposite sides of the galaxy , suggesting a rotating disk at least @xmath15 in diameter . in vcc  1437",
    "we also detect emission on opposite sides of the galaxy , but the arecibo data alone does not give evidence of rotation .",
    "we will discuss vcc  1437 further in sect .",
    "spectra from the several observed points around each galaxy are shown in fig .",
    "1 ( for mk  1263 ) and fig .",
    "2 ( for the other 4 bcds ) .",
    "four more virgo bcds have pre - upgrade arecibo mapping ( to lower sensitivity ) by us @xcite ; 2 of these ( vcc  0340 and vcc  0459 ) gave signs of being extended to a significant fraction of the arecibo beam and 2 did not ( vcc  0010 and ugc  7354 ) .",
    "none of the objects appears disk - like on the poss - ii films .",
    "all seven bcds mapped at the vla proved to be extended compared to the d array synthesized beam , with envelopes that extend well beyond the regions where stars have formed .",
    "the main disks of all of the objects exhibit solid body rotation , i.e. , their rotation curves rise linearly as far as we can trace the gas , far outside the region of high optical surface brightness . comparison",
    "to other ( non - bcd ) dwarf irregular galaxies is made in sect .",
    "three of the bcds ( mk  1263 , vcc  0172 and vcc  0459 ) have reasonably symmetric disks , but four of the objects ( detailed below ) displayed appendages which might be tidal flares , gas blown out of the disks by multiple supernovae , or distinct infalling clouds as detailed below .",
    "d array resolution is not adequate to allow us to distinguish which possibilities are more likely in any of the four cases . nor are we able to tell if the outer parts of these galaxies , aside from the apparent appendages , are irregular at more resolved angular scales .",
    "results for the detected galaxies are tabulated in table 3 , which has the following columns : galaxy name , assumed distance , type as listed in ned , flux integrated over velocity and the spatial extent of the galaxy , the corresponding mass , diameter of the @xmath16 contour on the integrated map in arcmin and kpc , the gradient of the rotation curve averaged over the approximately linear portion of the rotation curve ( for bcds only ) , mass to blue luminosity ratio , and to optical diameter ratio .      within the primary beam field centered on mk  1263 , we also detected emission from the sm galaxy cgcg  66 - 29 and the sa(s)c galaxy ngc  3389 ( at the edge of the field ) .",
    "emission from the bcd mk  1263 and from ngc  3389 appears disklike .",
    "the disk around mk  1263 is misaligned by nearly @xmath17 from the high surface brightness optical portion of the galaxy visible on the dss ( fig .",
    "the rotation curve is approximately solid body in form .",
    "the emission - bearing channel maps are displayed in fig .",
    "the disk around ngc  3389 is reasonably normal for a galaxy of its type ; since the galaxy lies very near the edge of the primary beam field , we can not determine whether the apparent appendage to the south of the disk in fig .",
    "5 is real or due to noise .",
    "channel maps are presented in fig .",
    "6 .    in @xcite , we attributed emission seen with the arecibo beam to the south of cgcg  66 - 29 ( called fs  35 in that paper ) to the imiv galaxy fs  36 . the vla results shown in fig .",
    "5 forces us to alter that interpretation .",
    "there is a cloud of to the south of cgcg  66 - 29 , but it is displaced about @xmath18 to the sw of fs  36  further from fs  36 than fs  36 is from cgcg  66 - 29 .",
    "there is a more irregular apparently detached cloud a similar distance n of cgcg  66 - 29 .",
    "the two galaxies are @xmath19 apart , at projected separation 19.9 kpc assuming a distance of 25.4 mpc for the group ( allowing for virgocentric infall ) .",
    "the nearest large galaxy is ngc  3389 , @xmath20 to the nw , at projected separation 103 kpc .",
    "we are not aware of any intragroup medium having been detected in x - ray .",
    "some form of tidal interaction therefore seems the most likely explanation for the two detached clouds , although it is difficult to envision a detailed tidal scenario which would completely strip fs  36 of its gas while also drawing out the northern tail ( and perhaps the sw cloud as well ) from cgcg  66 - 29 .",
    "ic  3017 = vcc  0010 has an appendage to the sw , perpendicular to the major axes of both the optical image and the main disk , at velocities @xmath21  km  @xmath5 below the systemic velocity .",
    "the main disk is reasonably well aligned with the optical image in fig . 9 and displays quasi - solid - body rotation ( rotation velocity rising nearly linearly as far as we can trace the gas ) .",
    "channel maps are shown in fig . 10 .",
    "an h band image is available in @xcite .",
    "vcc  0024 has a main disk well aligned with the optical image as shown in fig .",
    "11 , but at each end there is a flare of kinked @xmath22 from the major axis , with a shallower scale length . there is , in addition , an apparently separate , small cloud with small velocity dispersion @xmath23 ( 12 kpc ) to the north , 50  km  @xmath5 below the systemic velocity of the galaxy .",
    "it is not clear , from d array observations alone , whether the flares are simply warps in an extended disk , tidal flares , or distinct clouds .",
    "the rotation curve is approximately solid - body in form , rising linearly to the end and continues smoothly through the flares .",
    "the small cloud to the north is detected at @xmath24 and can be seen most clearly in the 1237  km  @xmath5 panel of fig.12 , where there is a hint that there may be a low column density bridge to the main disk .",
    "images in b , v , and k are available in @xcite .",
    "vcc  0172 exhibits a relatively unremarkable disk with no distinct appendages or detached clouds evident above our detection threshold , around @xmath25 .",
    "the rotation curve appears to flatten on the nw end of the disk but not ( as much ) on the se end .",

    "@xcite describe the h@xmath26 morphology as `` c@xmath27e '' meaning that there is one or more prominent star formation regions near the center of the galaxy and one or more near the outer edge .",
    "vcc  0340 has a small , apparently distinct cloud just off the end of the major axis of the disk , @xmath28 ( 7 kpc ) n of the center of the galaxy .",
    "the cloud has velocity 60  km  @xmath5 higher than the galaxy s systemic velocity and very small velocity dispersion , and is unresolved by the d array . at @xmath29",
    ", it also begs confirmation .",
    "the velocity field is complex , with some indications of tumbling about an ew axis but without a simple pattern .",
    "an h band image is available in @xcite .",
    "the imv dwarf vcc  0329 was detected near the edge of the primary beam field ; our map and velocity field are shown in fig .",
    "17 , with channel maps in fig . 18 . in the same primary beam field",
    ", there is a newly discovered ( by us , in these d array observations ) cloud around vcc  0379 , a 17.0 mag lsb typed ? by @xcite .",
    "the details are shown in figs .",
    "19 and 20 .",
    "vcc  1437 = mk 772 exhibits a disk in solid body rotation , but then has an obvious appendage to the nw at a velocity close to the systemic velocity , 20  km  @xmath5 lower than the velocity of the w end of the main disk .",
    "d array mapping suggests , but not conclusively , that this is a distinct cloud .",
    "prior c array mapping by @xcite was evidently not deep enough to detect the appendage .",
    "since the cloud is unresolved by the d array beam its diameter is @xmath30  kpc and it has a small velocity dispersion .",
    "the integrated mass is @xmath31  @xmath32 assuming a distance to vcc  1437 of 19 mpc .",
    "that makes the cloud very much comparable to the compact high velocity clouds ( chvc ) observed around the milky way , if the chvc have distances of order 150 - 200 kpc @xcite .",
    "images of vcc  1437 in h and h@xmath26 are shown in @xcite , and @xcite contribute spectroscopy leading to chemical abundances for the galaxy .",
    "those results , along with the significant disk we have found , render the e : type , recorded in the rc3 @xcite and repeated in ned , highly suspect .      in table 4 , results from the vla mapping are compared with those from arecibo mapping for objects in common in the two samples .",
    "the compared quantities are : ( 1 ) the diameter of the envelope , measured to the outermost point at which we can detect the gas with each instrument , converted to kpc using the distance as given in table 3 ; ( 2 ) the velocity profile width ( fwhm ) , @xmath33 , in km  @xmath5 ; and ( 3 ) the integrated mass @xmath34 in units of @xmath35  @xmath32 .",
    "the final column gives the ratio of indicative dynamic mass @xmath36 to mass , using radii measured from the vla maps , profile widths from arecibo ( since we have better velocity resolution in that data ) and masses from arecibo ( since the single dish has better sensitivity to outlying diffuse gas ) .",
    "since the optical images are too asymmetric to determine inclinations reliably , and the velocity fields in the maps are too irregular to allow us to determine kinematical inclinations , we took @xmath37 for all bcds .    in all cases",
    "save vcc  0172 ( for which emission was found only in the central beam at arecibo ) and vcc  0024 , the arecibo diameter measurement is larger than the vla measurement .",
    "this is expected , since arecibo is more sensitive to diffuse emission and can reach lower column densities in the allotted time than the vla . however , the arecibo diameters are not _ much _ larger , only by a few percent in most cases and never more than a factor of 2 .",
    "similarly , the masses are larger in the arecibo maps by only a few percent in most cases .",
    "this suggests that the envelopes are only a little larger than shown in the vla maps . the arecibo and vla profile widths are comparable , within the resolution of the vla maps for the most part .",
    "since the rotation curves in the vla maps mostly rise linearly as far as the vla can trace the gas , this comparision confirms that outlying gas does not contribute greatly to the integrated profile .    with the single exception of vcc  0340 , all bcds mapped with the vla have @xmath38 significantly larger than the total mass of gas plus",
    "stars could be for any reasonable stellar mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the w cloud , of which vcc  0340 is a member , is a region of enhanced deficiency @xcite , so one possibility is that vcc  0340 has suffered more ram - pressure stripping than the other bcds in our sample .",
    "that would remove gas preferentially from the outskirts , reducing both the measured diameter and the velocity profile width , artifically reducing @xmath38 .",
    "the otherwise large values of @xmath39 suggest that these bcds have considerable dark matter halos .",
    "the virgo cluster is comprised of a number of subclusters , and superimposed on the cluster proper are a couple of clouds thought to lie at a distance larger by about a factor of two @xcite .",
    "these background clouds ( m and w ) contain a significant number ( 14 ) of the 35 vcc bcds , according to the membership assignments of @xcite . of the 10 virgo bcds that have been mapped to date ,",
    "4 ( vcc  0144 , 0172 , 0324 and 0468 ) are members of the w cloud , one ( vcc  0340 ) is a member of the w cloud which is thought @xcite to lie between the w cloud and the southern extension of the virgo cluster , two ( vcc  0010 and 0022 ) are members of the m cloud which is the other background cloud , one ( vcc  1437 ) is a member of subcluster b ( formerly the s cloud , roughly centered on m49 ) , one ( vcc  0459 ) is a member of subcluster a ( associated with m87 ) , and vcc  0024 is a member only of the cluster at large , not of any distinct subcluster or cloud .",
    "the w , m and w clouds also have an enhanced ratio of bcds to dwarf irregulars ( di ) as a whole ( types sdm , sm , i m , bcd and uncertain , as assigned in the vcc ) : 12/28 ( 43% ) , 2/4 ( 50% ) and 2/6 ( 33% ) respectively ( 16/38 or 42% overall ) .",
    "in contrast , the a and b subclusters along with galaxies assigned only to the cluster at large have bcd to di ratio 19/110 , or 17% .",
    "the w and m cloud bcds , as a group , have significantly smaller angular diameters than the bcds affiliated with subclusters a and b and the cluster at large . only one ( vcc  0172 ) of the w@xmath27 m cloud bcds has an diameter ( at column density @xmath40  atoms  @xmath2 ) much in excess of @xmath41 while 2 of the 3 bcds affiliated with subclusters a and b or the cluster at large have extents well above @xmath41 .",
    "the w bcd has as small an extent as any of the bcds , however .",
    "since we chose objects for mapping based on large mass and large optical diameter , definitive results must await mapping of a larger sample .",
    "however , while there is no doubt considerable spread in the intrinsic extents , these results are consistent with the w@xmath27 m cloud bcds being more distant by a factor of 2 as suggested by the tully - fisher relation applied to the larger members of those clouds @xcite .",
    "we do not see any more nor less tendency toward morphological peculiarities ( e.g. , appendages or spurs , outlying clouds , unusual velocity fields ) in the w@xmath27 m cloud bcds than in the nearer sample .",
    "table 3 indicates that diameters @xmath42 are larger than optical diameters @xmath43 in every measurable case , but not enormously larger .",
    "the mean of the ratio @xmath44 for the 6 vcc bcds is 3.29 with a standard deviation of 1.59 ( standard deviation of the mean 0.65 ) and a median of 3.0 .",
    "the sample spans a range of 1.53 to 6.19 in the ratio . by comparison ,",
    "the 51 objects in our `` field '' sample from the literature ( see table 5 ) have a mean of 3.44 with standard deviation 2.37 ( standard deviation of the mean 0.34 ) and a median of 2.5 , spanning the range 0.5 to 9.3 . admittedly , both the and optical diameters for the field sample are less homogeneously measured .",
    "still , we have no evidence for any significant difference in this ratio .",
    "this suggests that the virgo bcds  or this subsample at any rate  have not undergone any significant ram pressure stripping , since that would have removed some of the outermost gas .",
    "bcds are in general fairly rare in comparison to di galaxies , which have already been shown to have insufficient outlying gas to account for the numbers of lyman limit systems observed at higher redshift @xcite . since @xmath44 is not _",
    "large for bcds , these relatively rare objects are not good candidates for higher redshift lyman limit systems either .",
    "the velocity fields for mk  1263 , ic  3017 , and vcc  0459 have relatively evenly spaced contours suggesting that the rotation curves of these galaxies rise linearly , in solid - body fashion , as far as we can trace the gas .",
    "the outermost contours for vcc  0024 are much more widely spaced than those inside , which might be taken as an indication that the rotation curve is beginning to flatten .",
    "however , the evident warp in the map complicates the issue .",
    "vcc  0340 is too poorly resolved and too complex for us to say much about its rotation curve .",
    "vcc  1437 is in solid - body rotation to the edge of the disk on both ends of the major axis , but then falls abruptly back to the central velocity on the northwest end .",
    "we interpret this to be an infalling cloud , as discussed in sect .",
    "4.2.3 above , and not a turnover in the rotation curve of the disk itself . on the southeast end",
    "the velocity field map also suggests a turn back toward the central velocity , but we have poor signal - to - noise in that beam . in all cases , however , we have only a few beams spanning the disk .",
    "beam - smearing of these rotation curves must be significant .",
    "it is unlikely , in particular , that we could identify a kink within the central arcmin or so of any of the galaxies . in spite of those complications ,",
    "we have attempted to estimate an average rotation curve gradient ( up to an unknown factor of @xmath45 ) over the approximately linear portion of the rotation curve .",
    "the values , listed in table 3 , span the range 0.003 - 0.016  km  @xmath46 with a median of 0.008  km  @xmath46 . by way of comparison ,",
    "the h@xmath26 velocity fields for field bcds obtained by @xcite have generally steeper central gradients : their range is 0.027 - 0.543  km  @xmath46 with a median of 0.080  km  @xmath46 , ten times larger than ours .",
    "whether the h@xmath26 gradients reflect orderly rotation or highly non - circular motions in the vicinity of the region of active star formation is unclear , however .",
    "references to maps of field bcds and related objects are collected in table 5 . in many cases ,",
    "the velocity fields are so irregular or the spatial resolution so poor that the authors do not attempt to derive a rotation curve .",
    "we have , however , attempted to characterize the published velocity fields as to whether the rotation curve is linearly rising to the outermost point at which any semblance to regularity remains , or flattens out on one or both sides of the major ( kinematical ) axis .",
    "of the 42 cases in which a velocity field is shown , 13 appear to be approximately solid body , 10 remain linear on one side of the major axis but flatten on the other , 18 flatten on both sides , and one appears to be an ongoing merger of 2 clouds .",
    "two general features are important for comparison with dis and the discussion in sect .",
    "5.4 which follows .",
    "( @xmath47 ) while in most cases the angular resolution is not small compared to the size of the region where star formation is important , the slow rise of the linear portion of the rotation curve makes it clear that the rotation velocity must be quite small over that region .",
    "however , ( @xmath48 ) the rotation velocity rises to an appreciable value , of order 50  km  @xmath5 , in the well - resolved outermost regions of the disk .",
    "this is comparable to the maximum velocities reached in the optical velocity fields of @xcite .",
    "typical di galaxies with mapping reported in the literature mostly have rotation curves that rise linearly and somewhat rapidly in the central regions , then kink to a shallower slope .",
    "for example , in @xcite rotation curves for 62 late - type dwarf galaxies are shown .",
    "of these , 51 have rotation curves that are kinked , clearly steeper in the central regions than in the outskirts of the disk .",
    "only eleven have rotation curves that appear linear as far as they can be traced .",
    "two general features for di are : ( @xmath47 ) star formation extends well beyond the kink in the rotation curve , i.e. , to regions where the rotation velocity is already of order the maximum value , and ( @xmath48 ) this maximum value is typically of the same order as for bcds , @xmath49  km  @xmath5 .      for di",
    "there is still a little controversy about the detailed shape of the rotation curve in the innermost region @xcite , but there is agreement that this region is small compared to where most of the gas and stars are found and that appreciable rotation velocities are reached in those outer regions .",
    "the dark matter mass thus greatly exceeds the baryon mass and , even if there were strong starbursts in the central regions , dynamical instabilities are unlikely",
    ".    for bcds one has to make a distinction between the inner and outer regions when considering questions of `` blowup '' and `` blowout '' @xcite . for the outer regions , and for the galaxy as a whole ,",
    "the dark matter mass is much larger than the gas mass , and starbursts are not likely to eject much material from the galaxy as a whole . for the inner region , where the stars are , the situation is less clear .",
    "the stars are young , massive and luminous , but the total stellar mass is not very large .",
    "since the rotation velocity is so small here , the total indicative gravitational mass is only moderately large .",
    "the resolution of our vla d array mapping is not sufficient to tell whether the gas is almost as concentrated as the stars or almost uniform density over a vla beam .",
    "if it is concentrated , the gas mass could exceed the sum of stellar and dark matter mass within the star - forming region , and a very energetic starburst could not only eject most of the gas from the inner region , but also cause a distension of the stellar and dark matter distribution .",
    "this distension is purely dynamical , somewhat as in @xcite and @xcite , but the stars and dark matter are only lifted into somewhat larger orbits .",
    "the gas , on the other hand , can fall back into the inner region after it cools .",
    "better angular resolution mapping of the inner regions is clearly needed to investigate this conjecture .",
    "several studies seeking indications of external interactions with field bcds ( or objects that would resemble the vcc bcds on comparable plate material at a comparable distance ) have been conducted ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar efforts have been made to find potential interactors that might , a few hundred my in the future , turn otherwise isolated dwarf irregular galaxies into bcds @xcite . in most cases",
    "in which a distinct companion is found , careful inspection of the dss reveals that the companion is a low surface brightness galaxy .",
    "@xcite , in a search for _ optical _ companions in the vicinity of 86 bcds from the second byurakan survey , concluded that @xmath50 of their sample were plausibly triggered either by tidal interaction with a companion ( either larger or smaller than the bcd ) or by a recent merger . @xcite and @xcite argue on the basis of h@xmath26 kinematics that the several blue compact galaxies in their sample result from mergers of gas - rich dwarf galaxies or massive clouds .",
    "detached clouds free of stars to the detection limit of the dss , however , appear to be quite rare .",
    "most surveys , like the present one , have been conducted with the vla in its lowest spatial resolution mode , the d array , and have synthesized beams not much smaller than the size of the bcd .",
    "therefore , for galaxies at roughly the distance of the virgo cluster , a gas cloud separated from the envelope of the bcd by less than the radius of the bcd might appear to be connected to that envelope , much like the vcc  1437 cloud discussed above . we have scoured the maps available in the literature ( see table 5 ) for such potential clouds as well as clearly separated clouds around field objects that would resemble the vcc bcds at a comparable distance on comparable plate material . in the vicinity of 51 field ( or loose",
    "group ) bcds , we find 20 with no companion objects within @xmath51 kpc ; 13 with companion clouds ( including previously catalogued galaxies ) that have stars evident on the dss or other optical images available to the authors of those maps ; 12 with clearly separated , spatially unresolved , low column density clouds with no stars visible on available optical images ; and 9 with appendages or spurs that do not appear to be tidal in nature and which might be detached from the bcd s envelope at higher spatial resolution . for our 6 virgo bcds ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are 2 , 1 , 2 and 2 .",
    "( in both sets of bcds , some bcds appear in multiple categories . )",
    "our sample of virgo bcds is not yet large enough to say whether or not there are differences in the two distributions .",
    "we have presented arecibo maps of five vcc bcd galaxies and vla d array maps of six along with a field in leo containing one bcd , a sm - imiv pair , and a much larger spiral .",
    "the vcc maps form an installment toward an eventual sample statistically complete enough to contrast with the growing field sample from the literature .    of the five bcds in the virgo cluster and surrounding clouds mapped at arecibo",
    ", three gave evidence of emission extended outside the central @xmath6 beam .",
    "that increases the sample of vcc bcds with arecibo mapping to nine objects , with five in all showing emission outside the central beam .",
    "the extended objects were those with the largest masses , largest optical diameters , and largest velocity profile widths , and so we used those criteria to select the six vcc bcds for mapping with the vla d array .",
    "all seven bcds mapped at the vla are clearly extended beyond the d array beam , @xmath52 , and all give some indications of systematic rotation .",
    "we found two examples of kinematically distinct appendages which might resolve into distinct gas clouds at higher resolution , and two clearly detached low column density clouds ( one appearing to be a compact hvc in the process of coallescing with the galaxy s disk ) . in all cases",
    "the clouds are within @xmath53 kpc of the bcd .",
    "comparison was made to a sample of similarly mapped field bcds ( or related objects ) drawn from the literature , but conclusive statements were not possible due to the small size of the virgo sample mapped to date . however ,",
    "regarding the question of starburst triggering by interactions , we note that about one - third of the bcds in both samples discussed here do not appear to have companion clouds , with or without stars .",
    "mapping of these objects at higher angular resolution , and of additional virgo objects , is clearly indicated .",
    "determinations of the hot ( ionized ) gas content in bcds would also be very helpful in determining whether the kinematically distinct clouds are falling in or being blown out .",
    "we have one fairly firm double negative result : there is little evidence for any appreciable mass loss due to ram pressure stripping , but also no evidence for any extremely extended envelope at column densities @xmath54  @xmath2 .",
    "bcd galaxies are therefore not good candidates for lyman limit systems .",
    "the rotation curves rise linearly and slowly all the way out for bcds , with maximum velocity and total indicative mass comparable to those for the more common low surface brightness dwarf irregular galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "the angular momentum in the very small central star - forming region is quite small .",
    "better angular resolution will be required to find out just how small the angular momentum is and to see just how concentrated the gas is .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for comments which helped increase the clarity of this paper .",

    "government grant nag w-2166 .",
    "the images of these surveys are based on photographic data obtained using the oschin schmidt telescope , which is operated by the california institute of technology and palomar observatory on palomar mountain .",
    "the plates were processed into the present compressed digital form with the permission of that institution . the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss - ii )",
