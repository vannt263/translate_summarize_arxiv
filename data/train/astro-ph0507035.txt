    "the _ chandra _  x - ray observatory  @xcite , formerly the advanced x - ray astrophysics facility , axaf , was launched on july 23 , 1999 , and for five years has been realizing its promise to open new domains in high resolution x - ray imaging and spectroscopy of celestial sources @xcite .",
    "the high energy transmission grating , hetg @xcite , is one of two objective transmission gratings on _ chandra _ ; the low energy transmission grating , letg @xcite , is of a similar design but optimized for energies less than 1  kev .",
    "when the hetg is used with the _ chandra _  mirror and a focal plane imager , the resulting high energy transmission grating spectrometer , hetgs , provides spectral resolving powers of up to 1000 over the range 0.4 - 8 kev ( 1.5 - 30  ) for point and moderately extended sources . through year 2004",
    ", the hetgs has been used in 422 observations covering the full range of astrophysical sources and totaling 20  ms , or 17  % of chandra observing time .",
    "up - to - date information on _ chandra _  and the hetg is available from the _ chandra _  x - ray - center @xcite .",
    "this paper summarizes the design , fabrication , ground and flight calibration of the hetg .",
    "the high energy transmission grating , hetg @xcite , is a passive array of 336 diffraction grating facets each about 2.5  cm square .",
    "each facet is a periodic nano - structure consisting of finely spaced parallel gold bars supported on a thin plastic membrane .",
    "the facets are mounted on a precision hetg element support structure , hess , which in turn is mounted on a hinged yoke just behind the high resolution mirror assembly , hrma @xcite . a telemetry command to _ chandra _",
    "activates a motor drive that inserts hetg into the optical path just behind the hrma , approximately 8.6  m from the focal plane , shown schematically in figure  [ fig : hetgs_diag ] .",
    "the lower portion of this figure shows a schematic of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer @xcite spectroscopy detector , acis - s , with the hetg s shallow `` x '' dispersion pattern indicated .",
    "this pattern arises from the use of two types of grating facets in the hetg , with dispersion axes offset by 10  @xmath0 so that the corresponding spectra are spatially distinct on the detector .",
    "the choice ( and complexity ) of using two types of grating facets resulted from our desire to achieve optimum performance in both diffraction efficiency and spectral resolution over the factor - of-20 energy range from 0.4 to 8  kev .",
    "these facets are the heart of the hetg and are schematically shown in figure  [ fig : grat_cross_secs ] with their properties given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "one type , the medium energy grating ( meg ) , has spatial period , bar thickness , and support membrane thickness optimized for the lower portion of the energy range .",
    "these meg facets are mounted on the two outer rings of the hess so that they intercept rays from the outer two mirror shells of the hrma , which account for @xmath165% of the total hrma effective area below 2  kev .",
    "the second facet type , the high energy grating ( heg ) , has finer period for higher dispersion and thicker bars to perform better at higher energies .",
    "the heg array intercepts rays from the two inner hrma shells , which have most of the area above @xmath15 kev .",
    "when the hrma s converging x - rays pass through the transmission grating assembly they are diffracted in one dimension by an angle @xmath2 given by the grating equation at normal incidence ,    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the integer order number , @xmath5 is the photon wavelength , ) are nearly constant with @xmath5 ) and wavelength is commonly used in the high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy community .",
    "however , since photon energy has been commonly used in high - energy x - ray astrophysics ( as is appropriate for non - dispersive spectrometers like proportional counters and ccds ) , we use either energy or wavelength values interchangeably depending on the context .",
    "the values are related through : @xmath6  kev . ]",
    "@xmath7 is the spatial period of the grating lines , and @xmath2 is the dispersion angle .",
    "a `` normal '' undispersed image is formed by the zeroth - order events , @xmath8 , while the higher orders form overlapping dispersed spectra that stretch on either side of the zeroth - order image . by design",
    "the first orders , @xmath9 , dominate .",
    "higher orders are also present however the acis itself has moderate energy resolution sufficient to allow the separation of the overlapping diffracted orders .    as with other spectrometers , the overall performance of the hetgs can be characterized by the combination of the effective area encoded in an auxiliary response function , arf @xcite , and a line response function , lrf , encoded as a response matrix function , rmf . for this grating system",
    "the lrf describes the spatial distribution of monochromatic x - rays along the dispersion direction ; a simple measure of the lrf is the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , @xmath10 , expressed in dimensionless form as the resolving power , @xmath11 . with the hrma s high angular resolution ( better than 1 arc sec ) , the hetg s high dispersion ( as high as 100 arc seconds /  ) , and the small , stable pixel size ( 24  @xmath12 m or @xmath13  arc sec ) of acis - s , the hetgs achieves spectral resolving powers up to @xmath14 .",
    "the following sections present details of the key ingredients and papers related to the design of the hetgs , the fabrication and test of the individual hetg grating facets , and the results of full - up ground calibration of the flight hetg .",
    "the final section demonstrates the hetgs flight performance and discusses the calibration status of the instrument after five years of flight operation .",
    "obtaining high throughput requires that x - rays are dispersed into the @xmath9 orders with high diffraction efficiency ; this is largely determined by the micro - properties of the meg and heg grating bars and support membranes .",
    "both the meg and heg facets are designed to operate as `` phased '' transmission gratings to achieve enhanced diffraction efficiency over a significant portion of the energy range for which they are optimized @xcite . a conventional transmission grating with _ opaque _ grating bars achieves a maximum efficiency in each @xmath151@xmath16  order of 10% , for the case of equal bar and gap widths @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the grating bars of the meg and heg are partially transparent  x - rays passing through the bars are attenuated and also phase - shifted , depending on the imaginary and real parts , respectively , of the index of refraction at the given @xmath5 .",
    "ideally , the grating material and thickness can be selected to give low attenuation and a phase - shift of @xmath17 radians at the desired energy @xcite .",
    "this causes the radiation that passes through the bars to destructively interfere with the radiation that passes through the gaps when in zeroth order ( where the relevant path - lengths are equal ) reducing the amount of undiffracted ( zeroth - order ) radiation and , conversely , enhancing the diffracted - orders efficiency . in practice",
    ", this optimal phase interference can only be obtained over a narrow wavelength band , as seen in figure  [ fig : multiv_effic ] , because of the rapid dependence of the index of refraction on wavelength .",
    "initial designs based on these considerations suggested using gold for the hegs and silver for the megs ; in the end , fabrication considerations lead to selecting gold for both grating types and optimizing the bar thicknesses of the meg and heg gratings .",
    "because the grating bars are not opaque , the diffraction efficiency also depends on the cross - sectional shape of the bars , and this shape must be determined and incorporated into the model of the instrument performance .",
    "the effect of phase shifting is shown in figure  [ fig : multiv_effic ] where the dotted line represents the single - side @xmath18 order diffraction efficiency ( _ i.e. _ , one - half the total @xmath18 order diffraction efficiency ) for a non - phased opaque grating and the dashed and solid lines are from models which include the phase - shifting effects . for the opaque case ( dotted ) , the diffraction efficiency of the grating bars is constant with energy ; the variations seen in figure  [ fig : multiv_effic ] result from also including the absorption by the support membrane and the plating base , the thin base layers shown in figure  [ fig : grat_cross_secs ] , whose thicknesses are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "these layers are nearly uniform over the grating and therefore only absorb x - rays .",
    "the phased heg and meg gratings achieve higher efficiencies than opaque gratings over a significant portion of the energy band .",
    "the structure in the heg and meg efficiencies is caused by structure in the index of refraction of gold , _",
    "i.e. _ , the m edges around 2 kev .",
    "the efficiency falls at high energy as the bars become transparent and introduce less phase shift to the x - rays , falling below the opaque value at an energy depending on their thickness .",
    "the general formula for the efficiency of a periodic transmission grating , using kirchhoff diffraction theory with the fraunhofer approximation is @xcite :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is the efficiency in the @xmath21 order , @xmath22 is the wavenumber ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is the complex index of refraction often expressed in real and imaginary parts ( or optical constants ) as @xmath25 , @xmath7 is the grating period , and @xmath26 is the grating path - length function of the normalized coordinate @xmath27 . the path - length function @xmath28 may be thought of as the projected thickness of the grating bar versus location along the direction of periodicity ; at normal incidence it is simply the grating bar cross - section .",
    "the path - length function @xmath28 can be reduced to a finite number of parameters .",
    "for example , if a rectangular bar shape is assumed , then @xmath29 can be computed with two parameters , a bar width and a bar thickness ( or height . ) adding an additional parameter , @xcite reported on the theory and measurements of tilted rectangular gratings which yields a trapezoidal path - length function for small incident angles .",
    "our data are fit adequately for performance estimates if a simple rectangular grating bar shape is assumed @xcite . however",
    ", modeling the measured first - order efficiencies to @xmath11  %  requires a more detailed path - length function .",
    "this is not surprising given the evidence from electron microscope photographs ( figure  [ fig : emicros ] ) that the bar shapes for the hetg gratings are not simple rectangles .",
    "we found from laboratory measurements ( see below ) that sufficient accuracy could be achieved by modeling the grating bar shape in a piece - wise linear fashion .",
    "we parameterize the shape by specifying a set of vertices , _",
    "e.g. _ , as shown in the insets of figure  [ fig : multiv_effic ] , by their normalized locations , @xmath30 , and thicknesses , @xmath31 ; the end - point vertices are fixed at ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,0 ) .",
    "we have found in our modeling that 5 variable vertices are sufficient to accurately model these gratings in @xmath32 , @xmath18 and @xmath33 orders and yet not introduce redundant parameters .",
    "finally , this multi - vertex path - length function also lends itself to simple calculation as presented in appendix  [ sec : effic_append ] .    note",
    "that this multi - vertex model allows an asymmetric ( effective ) bar shape which generally leads to unequal plus and minus diffraction orders , as in the case of a blazed transmission grating @xcite or as arises when a trapezoidal grating is used at off - normal ( `` tilted '' ) incidence .",
    "hence , this multi - vertex model can be a useful extension of the symmetric , multi - step scheme formulation in @xcite .",
    "for the hetg gratings this asymmetric case arises primarily when the roughly trapezoidal heg gratings were tested at non - normal incidence , producing an asymmetry of up to 30  % per degree of tilt .",
    "however , the asymmetry is linear for small tilt angles from the normal and so the sum of the plus and minus order efficiencies remains nearly constant .",
    "we used high intensity x - ray beams at several synchrotron radiation facilities for several purposes : ( i ) to measure the optical constants and absorption edge structure of the grating materials and supporting polyimide membranes ; ( ii ) to make absolute efficiency measurements of several gratings to validate and constrain our grating performance model and provide estimates of its intrinsic uncertainties ; ( iii ) to calibrate several gratings for use as transfer standards in our in - house calibration ; and ( iv ) to measure the efficiencies of several gratings also calibrated in - house to assess uncertainties ; see  @xcite .",
    "synchrotron radiation tests were performed at four facilities over several years .",
    "a first set of measurements were made at the national synchrotron light source ( nsls ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) piggy - backing on equipment and expertise @xcite developed to support the determination of the reflectivity properties of the hrma coating .",
    "the general configuration of these tests is indicated in figure  [ fig : synchro_setup ] ; key ingredients are : an input of bright , monochromatic x - rays from the beam line , a beam monitoring detector which is inserted frequently to normalize the beam intensity , a detector fitted with a narrow slit ( 0.002 and 0.008 inches were used ) that could be rotated to intercept radiation at a desired diffraction angle , and the grating itself which could be rotated ( `` tilted '' ) about the vertical ( grating bar ) axis and also removed for detector cross - calibration .",
    "data sets were taken automatically with one or more of the controlled parameters varied : monochromator energy scan , diffraction angle ( order ) scan , and a grating tilt scan .",
    "initial modeling based on a rectangular grating bar model and using the optical constants , @xmath34 and @xmath2 , obtained from the scattering factors ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) published by @xcite indicated significant disagreement with the henke values for the gold optical constants @xcite .",
    "the most noticeable feature was that the energies of the gold m absorption edges were shifted from the tabulated amounts by as much as 40  ev , a result obtained earlier by @xcite from reflection studies of gold mirrors . in an effort to determine more accurate optical constants ,",
    "the transmission of a gold foil was measured over the range 2.036.04  kev , and the values of @xmath2 and @xmath34 were revised @xcite .",
    "the widely used henke tables were modified in 1996 to reflect these results .",
    "subsequent tests on gratings explored bar shape , tilt and asymmetry @xcite , and tests at the radiometry laboratory of the physikalish - technische bundesanstalt ( ptb ) below 2  kev identified the need to accurately model the edge structures of the polyimide support membrane to improve the overall fit @xcite . the analysis of the tests of gold and polyimide membranes at ptb in october 1995 is detailed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , cross - checks of the revised gold constants ( above 2  kev ) and polyimide were performed in august and november 1996 and have confirmed these latest revisions .    as a consequence of these analyses ,",
    "our model now includes revised gold optical constants over the full energy range appropriate to the hetg , and detailed structure for absorption edges of polyimide , c@xmath37h@xmath38o@xmath39n@xmath40 , and cr .",
    "an example of the agreement between measured and modeled efficiencies is shown in figure  [ fig : synch_effic ] .",
    "the hetgs optical design is based on an extension of the simple rowland spectrometer design in which the gratings and detector are located on opposite sides of an imaginary rowland circle @xcite .",
    "the rowland configuration maintains the telescope focal properties in the dispersion direction for a large range of diffraction angle , @xmath2 , thereby minimizing aberrations .",
    "a detailed discussion of the physics of rowland spectrometers , _",
    "i.e. _ , applying fermat s principle @xcite to evaluate aberrations of the faceted grating design , is given by @xcite .",
    "what follows is a simplified , ray - based description of the basic design .",
    "the `` top view '' of figure  [ fig : rowland_design ] shows the plane of dispersion ( the @xmath41 plane ) , as viewed along the cross - dispersion direction , @xmath42 .",
    "the diffraction angle is @xmath2 , as defined by equation  [ equ : dispersion ] ; note that the facet surfaces are normal to the incoming , central x - rays and are thus not tangent to the rowland circle . through the geometric properties of the circle , rays diffracted from gratings located along the rowland circle will all converge at the same diffracted point on the rowland circle .",
    "the dotted lines represent zeroth - order ( @xmath43 ) rays and the solid lines a set of diffracted order ( @xmath44 ) rays .",
    "the bottom panel , `` side view '' , gives a view along the dispersion direction , @xmath45 , at rays from a set of grating facets located in the the @xmath41 plane ( the same three facets in the `` top view '' now seen in projection , shown in light shading ) as well as additional grating facets ( darker facets ) located above ( or equivalently below ) the @xmath41 plane .",
    "each arc of additional facets is located on another rowland circle obtained by rotating the circle in the top view about the right - most line segment : the tangent to the rowland circle that is parallel to the dispersion direction and passes through the zeroth order focal point .",
    "the surface described by this rotation is the _ rowland torus_. all grating facets with centers located on this rowland torus and with surfaces normal to the converging rays ( dotted lines ) will focus their diffracted orders on a common arc on the rowland circle in the @xmath41 plane . since the rowland diameter is the same for all grating facets , and the zero order focus coincides for all facets , the m@xmath46 diffracted order from each facet is focused at the same angle @xmath2 , at the same place on the rowland circle .",
    "that is , best focus for the dispersion direction projection occurs along the inner surface of the rowland torus .",
    "together , these constructions show the astigmatic nature of the dispersed .    in order to maintain the best",
    "spectroscopic focus the detector surface must conform to or approximate this rowland curvature so that diffracted images are focused and sharp in the dispersion direction , and elongated in the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "the offset of the rowland circle from the tangent at the zeroth order focus is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the rowland spacing , the diameter of the rowland circle .    at the rowland focus , _",
    "e.g. _ , the @xmath49 case in figure  [ fig : rowland_focus ] , the image is elongated ( blurred ) in the cross - dispersion direction , @xmath42 , due to the astigmatic nature of the focus and has a peak - to - peak value given by : @xmath50 here @xmath51 is the radius of the ring of gratings around the optical axis as defined in figure  [ fig : rowland_design ] .",
    "the width of the image in the dispersion direction , @xmath45 , is given by a term proportional to the size of the ( planar ) grating facets which tile the rowland torus .",
    "the peak - to - peak value of this `` finite - facet size '' blur is given by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the length of a side of the square grating facet .",
    "this blur sets the fundamental resolving power limit for the rowland design with finite - sized facets . for the hetgs design",
    "this contribution is much smaller than the acis pixel size , see the @xmath49 case of figure  [ fig : rowland_focus ] , and is negligible compared to the terms in the resolving power error budget of appendix  [ sec : rowland_append ] .",
    "the 144 heg and 192 meg grating facets are the key components of the hetg and presented major technical challenges : to create facets with nanometer scale periods , nearly rectangular bar shape , nearly equal bar and gap widths , and sufficient bar depth to achieve high diffraction efficiencies , and with a high degree of uniformity in all these properties within each facet and among hundreds of facets .",
    "the facets must also be sufficiently robust to withstand the vibrational and acoustic rigors of space launch without altering their properties , much less being destroyed .",
    "the hetg grating facets were fabricated , one at a time , in an elaborate , multi - step process employing techniques adapted from those used to fabricate large - scale integrated circuits .",
    "development work was initiated in the nano structures laboratory and refinement of these processes took place over nearly two decades with final flight production in the space nanotechnology laboratory of the ( then ) mit center for space research .",
    "each facet was fabricated on a silicon wafer , which was used as a substrate but did not form any part of the final facet . in brief ,",
    "the process involved depositing the appropriate material layers on the wafer , imprinting the period on the outermost layer using uv laser interference , transferring that periodic pattern to the necessary depth , thereby creating a mold with the complement of the desired grating geometry , filling the mold with gold using electroplating , stripping away the mold material , etching away a portion of the si substrate , aligning and attaching a frame and then separating the finished facet from the silicon wafer . a highly simplified depiction of these steps is given in fig .  [ fig : fab_steps ] and described below .",
    "more complete details of the fabrication process are available elsewhere @xcite .    the first step , fig .",
    "[ fig : fab_steps]a , is to coat 100  mm - diameter silicon wafers with six layers of polymer , metal , and dielectric , comprising either 0.5  ( meg ) or 1.0  ( heg ) microns of polyimide ( which will later form the grating support membrane ) , 5 nm of chromium ( for adhesion ) and 20  nm of gold which serve as the plating base , @xmath54500  nm of anti - reflection coating  ( arc ) polymer , 15  nm of @xmath55 interlayer  ( il ) , and 200  nm of uv imaging photopolymer ( resist ) .    the second step , fig .  [ fig : fab_steps]b , is to expose the resist layer with the desired periodic pattern of the final grating using interference lithography at a wavelength of 351.1  nm .",
    "two nearly spherical , monochromatic wavefronts interfere to define the grating pattern period ; the radii of the spherical wavefronts are sufficiently large to reduce the inherent period variation across the sample to less than 50  ppm  rms .",
    "a high degree of period repeatability is required from the hardware because a unique exposure is used for each grating facet of the hetg .",
    "prior to each exposure , the moire pattern between the uv interference standing waves and a stable reference grating fabricated on silicon was used to lock the interferometer period . a secondary interferometer and active control",
    "are used to ensure that the interference pattern is stable over the approximately one minute exposure time .",
    "the interlayer , arc , and resist layers form an optically - matched stack designed to minimize the formation of planar standing waves normal to the surface , which would compromise contrast and linewidth control @xcite .    in the third step , fig .",
    "[ fig : fab_steps]c , the resist pattern is transferred into the interlayer using @xmath56 reactive - ion plasma etching ( rie ) . in the fourth step ,",
    "[ fig : fab_steps]d , the il pattern is transferred into the arc using @xmath57 rie .",
    "the rie steps are designed to achieve highly directional vertical etching with minimal undercut .",
    "the fifth step , fig .  [ fig : fab_steps]e , is to electroplate the arc mold with low - stress gold , which builds up from the cr / au plating base layer .",
    "the sixth step , fig .  [ fig : fab_steps]f , is to strip the arc / il plating mould using hydrofluoric ( hf ) acid etch , and plasma etching with @xmath56 and @xmath57 . at this point",
    "the gold grating bars are complete ; figure  [ fig : emicros ] shows electron micrographs of cleaved cross - sections of the gratings .    in the last step , fig .",
    "[ fig : fab_steps]g , a circular portion of the si wafer under the grating and membrane is etched through from the backside in @xmath58 acid using a spin etch process that keeps the acid from attacking the materials on the front side @xcite .",
    "the membrane , supported by the remaining ring of un - etched si wafer , is then aligned to an angular tolerance of @xmath59  degree and bonded to a flight `` frame '' using a two - part , low - outgassing epoxy .",
    "once cured , the excess membrane and si ring is cut away from the frame with a scalpel .",
    "the frames are custom - made of black chrome plated invar 36 , machined to tight tolerances , and the membrane bonding faces were hand lapped to remove burrs and ensure a flat , smooth surface during bonding .",
    "use of invar reduces any grating period variations which might be caused by thermal variation of the hetg environment between stowed and in - use positions on _ chandra_. likewise , the frame design has a single mounting hole to reduce the effect of mounting stresses on the facet period .",
    "each completed facet was mounted in a non - flight `` holder '' to allow for ease in storing , handling , and testing ; a schematic of holder and facet is shown in figure  [ fig : lr_setup ] .",
    "after years of preparation , we fabricated 245 heg and 265 meg gratings in 21 lots over a period of 16 months ; tests on the individual facets , next section , were used to select the elite set of 336 flight grating facets . as a postscript to the fabrication of the _ chandra _  hetg facets",
    ", we note that we have since extended our technology @xcite to fabricate gratings with finer periods @xcite , mesh - supported `` free - standing '' gratings for uv / euv and atom beam diffraction and filtering @xcite , and super - smooth reflection gratings @xcite .",
    "the completed hetg facets were put through a set of laboratory tests to characterize their quality and performance and to enable selection of an optimal complement of flight gratings .",
    "each facet went through a sequence of tests : i ) visual inspection , ii ) laser reflection ( lr ) test 1 , iii ) acoustic exposure , iv ) lr test 2 , v ) thermal cycling , vi ) lr test 3 , and finally vii ) x - ray testing .",
    "as noted , to reduce direct handling each fabricated facet was mounted to its own aluminum holder , the facet - level test equipment was designed to interface to the holder .    the laser reflection , lr , test @xcite uses optical diffraction of a laser beam ( hene 633 nm for meg , hecd 325 nm for heg ) from the grating surface to measure period and period variations of each facet . as shown in figure  [ fig : lr_setup ] the laser beam is incident on the grating under test at an off - normal angle . a specularly reflected beam and",
    "a first - order diffracted beam emerge from the illuminated region of the grating .",
    "these beams are focused with simple , long - focal length ( @xmath54500  mm ) lenses onto commercial ccds . under computer control",
    "the grating is moved so that a raster of over 100 regions is illuminated and the centroids of the reflected and diffracted beams in the ccd imagers are measured and recorded .",
    "changes in the four ccd spot coordinates , @xmath60 , are linearly related to changes in four local grating properties : the grating surface tilt and tip , the grating period and the grating line orientation ( roll . )",
    "these measurements are referenced to gratings ( heg and meg ) on silicon substrates permanently mounted in the system and measured before and after each raster scan set .",
    "the lr data files are used to determine for each grating facet a mean period @xmath7 and an rms period variation @xmath61 as well as contours of period variation across the facet .",
    "the flight grating sets were then selected to achieve minimal overall period variation for the complete heg and meg arrays , 106 and 127  ppm  rms , respectively .",
    "the ability of the lr apparatus to measure absolute period was calibrated using samples on silicon measured independently at the national institute for standards and technology .",
    "the average periods of the grating sets as determined from the lr measurements are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] , laboratory parameters .",
    "the diffraction efficiency @xcite of each facet was measured using the x - ray grating evaluation facility , x - gef , consisting of a laboratory electron - impact x - ray source , a collimating slit and grating assembly , and two detectors ( a position sensitive proportional counter and a solid state detector ) in a 17  m long vacuum system .",
    "facet tests were conducted at a rate of 2 gratings per day .",
    "the zeroth , plus and minus first and second order efficiencies were measured for five swath - like regions on each facet and at up to six energies , cu - l 0.930 kev , mg - k 1.254 kev , al - k 1.486 kev , mo - l 2.293 kev , ti - k 4.511 kev , and fe - k 6.400 kev . two facets , which had been tested at synchrotron facilities @xcite , served as absolute efficiency references .",
    "the measured monochromatic efficiencies were fit with our multi - vertex efficiency model @xcite , an example model fit to x - gef measured points is shown in figure  [ fig : xgef_example ] .",
    "these measurements and models allowed us to select the highest efficiency gratings for the flight heg and meg sets as well as to predict the overall grating - set efficiencies , section  [ sec : efficea ] .",
    "the hetg flight - candidate gratings were x - gef tested from mid-1995 through september of 1996 at a typical rate of two per day . a small set of non - flight gratings were retained in a laboratory vacuum and their diffraction efficiencies were measured with x - gef at seven epochs from late 1996 to february 2003 .",
    "these `` vacuum storage gratings '' showed no evolution in their diffraction properties giving us an expectation of stability for the hetg efficiency calibration .",
    "the flight hetg came into being when the selected 336 flight grating facets were mounted to the hetg element support structure , hess .",
    "the hess was numerically machined from a single plate of aluminum @xmath62  cm thick @xcite to create a spoke - and - ring structure with mounting surfaces and holes for the facets that conformed to the rowland torus design with a diameter given in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the hess mechanical design using tapered @xmath63  mm thick spokes achieves the objectives of : a low weight , an accurate positioning of the facets , and the ability to withstand the high-@xmath64 launch vibration environment .",
    "the flight hetg is shown in figure  [ fig : hetg_photo ] where the hess is black and the facet surfaces are gold ; its outer diameter is 1.1  m and three attachment points provide for its mounting to one of the two _ chandra _  telescope grating insertion mechanism yokes .",
    "the completed flight hetg weighs 10.41  kg of which 8.88  kg is due to the hess structure , 1.21  kg for the grating elements , and 0.32  kg for the the element - to - hess mounting hardware .",
    "the `` active ingredient '' of the hetg , the gold grating bars , weighs a meager 1.14  mg .",
    "the single - screw mounting scheme used to attached the facets to the hess adequately fixes all degrees of freedom of the facet except for rotation around the screw axis , _ i.e. _ , the `` roll '' angle of the facet .",
    "the roll angle was aligned using the ability of the grating to polarize transmitted light which has a wavelength longer than the grating period .",
    "a schematic of our setup , based on the polarization alignment technique of @xcite , is shown in figure  [ fig : align_setup ] .",

    "the acis geometry values were adjusted for this in 1999 to an accuracy of @xmath13  pixels . as a by - product of our hetg lsf work , see below , these values have been updated a second time to an accuracy of @xmath112  pixels and they show a stability at this level over the first five years of flight .    the acis pixel size as - fabricated was precisely quoted as 24.000  @xmath12 m and this value was used for initial flight data analysis",
    ". however it was later realized that this value was for room temperature - at the flight operating temperatures of order @xmath113  c the pixel size was determined to be 23.987  @xmath12 m and this value has been incorporated into the analysis software , etc .",
    "order separation is performed using the intrinsic energy resolution of the acis ccds , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : order_sel ] for a capella observation .",
    "acis suffered some radiation damage early in the mission which degraded the energy resolution of the front - illuminated , fi , chips @xcite ; relevant to the hetgs are fi chips : s0 , s2 , s4 , and s5 .",
    "however , as seen in the figure , the resolution of those ccds is still sufficient to permit clean separation of the hetg orders .",
    "the cxc pipeline software generally includes 95  % of the first - order events in its order selection ; the exact fraction depending on ccd and energy is calculated and included in the creation of hetgs arf response files .",
    "the acis detector suffers from pileup @xcite and this was expected in the bright zeroth - order image .",
    "however , pileup also shows up in the dispersed spectra of bright sources and/or bright lines ; algorithms have been developed to ameliorate this pileup @xcite .",
    "early in the mission there were indications in letg - acis data that the c - k edge of the acis optical blocking filter , obf , was deeper than predicted .",
    "later it was realized that a contaminant was building up on the acis obf and hence the effective acis qe was decreasing @xcite .",
    "the main spectral , temporal , and spatial effects of this contaminant have now been incorporated into _",
    "chandra _",
    "responses ; the composition and properties of the contaminant are the focus of continued measurement and modeling .",
    "comparison of the plus and minus orders of the hetgs lead to a measurement of a discrepancy of the qes of the acis fi ccds compared to acis back illuminated ccds ( s1 , s3 . )",
    "this issue is recently resolved into two components : the fi devices suffer from cosmic - ray dead time effects of order 4  %  and the bi qes are actually somewhat larger than initially calibrated .",
    "the bi qes were updated in august 2004 ( caldb 2.28 ) and are thus now included in hetgs arfs .",
    "all the essential parameters for the hetg in flight are the same or consistent with the ground values .",
    "some notable quantities are discussed below .",
    "_ clocking angle : _ the flight angles of the heg and meg dispersion axes measured on the acis - s are given in table  [ tbl-1 ] ; these values are in agreement with the xrcf - measured values .",
    "_ rowland geometry and spacing : _ an accurate account of the rowland geometry and spacing is crucial to achieve the best focus of the dispersed spectra on the detector .",
    "the rowland geometry of the hetg was demonstrated during initial plate - focus tests : dispersed line images from a range of wavelengths came to their best dispersion - direction focus at a common detector focus value , which agreed with the acis - s3 best - imaging focus value within 50 @xmath12 m .",
    "the spacing of the hetg from the focal plane , the rowland spacing , appeared initially to be off from the expected value until the acis pixel size change with temperature was included ( previous section ) .",
    "currently the hetg rowland spacing in flight , given in table  1 , is the value produced by ground installation metrology .",
    "_ grating period : _ the accuracy of the hetg - measured wavelength depends strongly on the assigned grating period . for the first years of use , the grating periods of the heg and meg were set to the laboratory measurement results .",
    "however , recent analysis of capella data over 5 years shows the meg - derived line centroid to be off by 40.2 @xmath155 km  s@xmath114 compared to the , apparently accurate , heg values , see figure  [ fig : capella_period ] .",
    "hence the meg period has recently ( caldb version 3.0.1 , february 2005 ) been set to 4001.95   , which makes the meg / heg line centroids mutually consistent .",
    "note that the stability of the wavelength scale is good to 10 km  s@xmath114 or 30 ppm over 5 years .",
    "_ dispersion and cross - dispersion profiles : _ recently the hetg line response functions ( lrfs ) have been modeled as a linear combination of two gaussians and two lorentzians to encode improved fidelity with the latest results of marx ray - trace models @xcite ; these lrf products are available in chandra caldb versions 2.27 and higher .",
    "a capella in - flight calibration data set ( obsid 1103 ) has been used to verify the quality of the lrfs . using a multi - temperature aped thermal model @xcite , the he - like line complex of mg  xi",
    "has been fitted with the grating line response functions .",
    "thermal broadening of mg  xi species has been taken into account in order to measure its line width properly .",
    "figure  [ fig : lrf_quality ] shows the result of this model fitting .",
    "the derived line widths are essentially in agreement with having no excess broadening , as expected for static coronal emission .",
    "note that the wings of the grating line response functions , two orders of magnitude below the peak when a few fwhms away , are generally well below the actual continuum and pseudo - continuum levels in celestial sources , and so flight dispersed data does not help calibrate the wings of lrf in general .",
    "in the cross - dispersion direction , we parameterize the fraction of energy `` encircled '' in an arbitrary rectangular region ( the encircled energy fraction , or eef ) and include this in the analysis software .",
    "the calibration values encoded into lrfs are generally consistent with observations .",
    "an uncertainty of 1  3% may be introduced by the eef term , though other quantitative uncertainties ( e.g. , hrma effective area ) are comparable or greater at this point in hetgs calibration .    _ hetg efficiency calibration : _ after five years of flight operation",
    "the efficiencies of figure  [ fig : hegmeg_effics ] , based on the facet laboratory measurements , have not been adjusted and are still used to create arfs for flight observations . likewise no additional features or edges have been ascribed to the hetg instrument response beyond what is in these calibration files . comparing heg and meg spectra of bright continuum sources",
    ", there is data to support making a _ relative _ correction of the heg and meg efficiencies to bring their measured fluxes into agreement .",
    "this relative efficiency correction is small , in the range 0  % to -7  % if applied to the meg , and varies smoothly in the 2    to 15    range .",
    "this final `` dotting the i '' of hetg calibration is nearing completion and will be included in upcoming cxc calibration files .      as the minimal effect on the hetgs performance of the various flight issues described above indicates , the hetgs has and is performing essentially as designed yielding high - resolution spectra of a broad range of astrophysical sources .",
    "some calibration issues are still being addressed , but these are at the @xmath115  % level in the arf and the fractions - of - a - pixel level in the grating lrf / rmf .    it is useful to put the _ chandra _  gratings performance in perspective with each other and with the reflection grating spectrometer , rgs , on xmm - newton .",
    "the effective areas for these grating instruments are shown in figure  [ fig : compare_areas ] ; note the complementary nature of the instruments in various wavelength ranges .",
    "the advance in resolving power these dispersive instruments have provided is clearly seen in figure  [ fig : compare_respower ] in comparison to the acis ccd resolving power values shown there as well . a line for the resolving power of a 6  ev fwhm micro - calorimeter ( e.g. , astro - e2 ) is plotted as well showing the uniqueness of the grating instruments in the range below 2  kev .    the high resolution and broad bandpass of the hetgs",
    "have made it the instrument of choice for many observers . in the first five years of chandra operation",
    ", the hetgs was used in over four hundred observations totaling approximately 20  ms of exposure time .",
    "this represents about 17  % of chandra s total observation time for that period . as is typical of spectroscopy at other wavelengths , hetgs observations tend to be long , ranging from tens of ks for bright galactic sources to hundreds of ks for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "a review of the results of these observations is outside the scope of this paper ; some examples can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath122 represents the path length of the photon as it passes through a grating bar ; it is sometimes called , rather loosely , the `` grating bar shape '' , and more rigorously , the `` path - length function ''",
    ".    it is preferable to work with the unit less quantity @xmath123 and to parameterize the path - length function in terms of it . for simplicity",
    ", we represent @xmath28 as a piece - wise sum of @xmath124 line segments , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the boxcar function defined to be @xmath127 if @xmath128 is true , or zero otherwise . by demanding that the path - length function be continuous , it is easy to see that the coefficients @xmath129 and @xmath130 are given by @xmath131 where @xmath132 . for obvious reasons , we require @xmath133 , and that the set of points @xmath134 be ordered according to @xmath135    the most redeeming feature of this particular parameterization of the path - length function is that the integral appearing in equation [ eq : fm1 ] may be readily evaluated with the result @xmath136 where @xmath137\\ ] ] is complex .",
    "although one may carry out the algebraic evaluation of @xmath116 using the above expression , it is very tedious and the result is not particularly illuminating .",
    "moreover , it is computationally more efficient to evaluate the above sums numerically using complex arithmetic and then compute @xmath116 by multiplying by the complex conjugate .",
    "the response of the hetgs can be crudely yet usefully characterized by the location and fwhm of the lrf core in both the dispersion and cross - dispersion directions .",
    "the `` resolving power '' of the spectrometer is given by @xmath138 where @xmath45 is the diffraction distance and @xmath139 is the fwhm of the resulting image projected along the dispersion axis .",
    "the design of the hetg involved the use of an error budget to assess and rss - sum the various contributions to the `` @xmath139 '' term of the resolving power and the corresponding `` @xmath140 '' term in the cross - dispersion .",
    "this error budget was useful for studying the dependence of the resolving power on the variation of individual error terms .",
    "the error budget results were verified by performing simplified ray - traces of single and multiple facets .",
    "the error budget presented in table  [ tab : error_budget ] includes all of the important error terms for the flight hetgs resolving power and cross - dispersion blur .",
    "note that the finite facet error term , equation  [ equ : ff_ppblur ] , is _ not _ included here because it is quite small for the hetg design . for compactness",
    "the error equations are referenced in the table and given , with discussion , in the following text .",
    "if the optic produces a roughly symmetric gaussian - like psf with an rms diameter of @xmath141 arc seconds , then the gaussian sigma of the 1-d projection of the psf is given , in units of mm in the focal plane , by : @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the focal length of the optic , table  [ tab : error_budget ] .",
    "this equation is useful when specific models of the optic psf are not available .",
    "the above equation for @xmath144 can be extended in two respects given knowledge of the optic .",
    "first there is generally a dependence on energy which is slowly varying , thus @xmath144 can be expressed as , say , a polynomial in @xmath145 .",
    "second , in the case of _ chandra _ , the psf of the mirror shells is more cusp - like than gaussian .",
    "this cusp - like psf causes the _ effective _ sigma of the psf projection to depend on the scale at which it is used , that is the size of other error terms it is convolved with .",
    "the following equations give approximations to the value of @xmath146 for hetgs design purposes ; blurs for the heg and meg mirror sets are given separately : @xmath147 @xmath148      aspect reconstruction adds a blur that is expected to be of order @xmath149 = 0.34 arc seconds rms diameter for _ chandra_. the resulting one - dimensional rms sigma is thus : @xmath150 where @xmath143 is the hrma focal length in mm .",
    "this error term is the spatial error introduced by the detector readout scheme . for a pixelated detector like acis",
    "we assume that the psf drifts with respect to the detector pixels and there is a uniform distribution of the centroid location in pixel phase . in this case",
    "the reported location of an event is the center of the pixel when in fact the event may have actually arrived @xmath151 pixel from the center .",
    "the rms value of such a uniform distribution is 0.29 times the pixel size : @xmath152 if a uniform randomization of the pixel value is applied during analysis , then a further uniform blur is added in quadrature , adding a factor of @xmath153 .",
    "a blur is added because the arrival time of a photon at the acis detector is quantized in units of a frame time .",
    "the parameter @xmath154 is the maximum dither rate expressed in units of arc seconds per frame time and results in a blur term of : @xmath155 where the factor of @xmath156 is present because the dither pattern is sinusoidal .",
    "including the effect of a defocus , @xmath157 , and a factor converting the peak - to - peak blur into an rms equivalent , we get the following equations for the rowland astigmatism contribution to the error budget in dispersion and cross - dispersion directions : @xmath158 @xmath159 these equations assume that the detector conforms to the rowland circle except for an overall translation by @xmath157 ( positive towards the hrma ) .",
    "the values of @xmath51 used in the error budget are effective values ",
    "weighted combinations of the relevant mirror shells .",
    "there are two main error terms which depend on how well the hetg is built : i ) period variations within and between facets ( `` @xmath61 '' ) and ii ) alignment ( `` roll '' ) variations about the normal to the facet surface within and between facets .",
    "the period variations lead to an additional blur in the dispersion direction : @xmath160 where @xmath61 is the rms period variation .",
