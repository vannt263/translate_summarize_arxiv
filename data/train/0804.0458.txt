    "in recent years , magnetic - memory devices like hard disk drives have been utilized for various products such as portable music players and home appliances . with the diversification of the use of the devices",
    ", they deal with a much larger amount of information and need to be more miniaturized and have higher capacity .",
    "however , it is believed that the conventional magnetic - memory devices will reach the limit of downsizing and high capacity in the near future .",
    "the reason is because the magnetization so far is controlled by a magnetic field and the more miniaturized and the higher capacity they get , the higher necessary field they will need .",
    "therefore , a new method which replaces the magnetic field is required .",
    "one of the methods expected is the control by electric current , i.e. current - induced magnetization reversal .",
    "the current - induced magnetization reversal was pointed out by berger  @xcite and slonczeski .",
    "@xcite the torque is caused by the @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange interaction via spin transfer effect arising from conservation of spin angular momentum between the current and the magnetization .",
    "to realize devices using the current - induced magnetization reversal , it is absolutely essential to reduce the current necessary . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that the problem can be solved by introduction of rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "@xcite a spin precession induced by rashba interaction is expected to affect the spin transfer torque mechanism , and to lead to efficient control of magnetization .",
    "the interaction has been proposed on two - dimensional electron systems realized at the interface of semiconductors , but is now known to arise quite generally when inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "@xcite for instance , significant rashba effect can arise on surface of heavy metals .",
    "@xcite our results therefore would apply to systems of magnetic semiconductors  @xcite with gate for rashba interaction attached , or on magnetic metallic thin films with heavy ions doped .",
    "@xcite    recent theoretical studies revealed that current - driven domain wall motion is significantly affected by spin relaxation process .",
    "actually , spin relaxation triggers a torque perpendicular to the adiabatic spin transfer torque  @xcite and this torque , @xmath0 torque  @xcite , acts as an effective force on domain wall , which deletes intrinsic pinning effects@xcite .",
    "microscopic analysis of spin relaxation was done in the case of spin flip scattering by random impurity spins and value of @xmath0 was found to be of similar magnitude with ( but not necessarily equal to ) the spin relaxation contribution to gilbert damping parameter @xmath4 @xcite . on the other hand , role of spin - orbit interaction , which also causes spin relaxation , on the wall dynamics has not been much studied so far .",
    "spin - orbit interaction in magnetic semiconductors was recently studied based on kohn - luttinger hamiltonian , and large enhancement of wall velocity due to spin - orbit interaction was found  @xcite .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit interaction we are going to study here turns out also to assist wall motion to a large extent . in this paper",
    ", we study current - driven domain wall motion in the presence of rashba interaction .",
    "rashba interaction acts on @xmath5-@xmath6 plane and electric current is applied along @xmath5 axis .",
    "the spin system we consider is with easy and hard axes .",
    "the wall is treated as planar and rigid , which is justified if easy axis energy gain , @xmath7 , is larger than hard axis anisotropy energy , @xmath8@xcite .",
    "we consider three cases where easy axis direction ( we call @xmath9 ) is @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath10 . the wall structure in these three cases are nel for @xmath11 and bloch wall for @xmath12 .",
    "we will see that dynamics of nel wall and bloch wall with @xmath13 ( called bloch(z ) ) are essentially the same , while bloch with @xmath14 ( bloch(y ) ) is different .",
    "the effect of current is calculated for each anisotropy configuration using gauge transformation in spin space , assuming adiabatic limit .",
    "the rashba interaction is treated perturbatively to the second order .",
    "expansion with respect to rashba interaction is justified here since electron has large spin polarization @xmath15 .",
    "( this is in contrast to the spin hall case without polarization , where perturbative treatment is not allowed  @xcite . ) below , we derive the effective hamiltonian for local spin , derive the equation of motion for domain wall , and then discuss wall dynamics solving the equation .",
    "domain wall is described by a lagrangian of local spins given by where local spin direction is expressed by polar coordinates ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the first term describes time evolution of local spin ( spin berry phase term ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of local spin we consider is given as follows ; the first term is ferromagnetic exchange interaction between local spins , the second and third terms are magnetic anisotropy energies .",
    "@xmath17 is the easy axis component of spin and @xmath18 is the corresponding anisotropic energy , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are hard axis ones .    in the absence of rashba interaction , we can choose space coordinate and spin coordinate independently .",
    "when rashba spin - orbit interaction is switched , spin and space coordinates correlate each other , and the spin torque and gauge field depend on the choice of magnetic easy axis , which we call @xmath9 axis .",
    "we consider three different cases with easy axis @xmath21 and @xmath10 .",
    "domain wall structure then becomes nel and bloch walls .",
    "we will call domain wall configuration with the easy axis label , such as bloch(z ) for a bloch wall with @xmath22 ( see table .",

    "let us discuss how rashba spin - orbit interaction affects current - induced domain wall motion based on the effective hamiltonian we derived",
    ". for this lagrangian formalization is convenient .",
    "we consider rigid planar domain wall .",
    "the lagrangian for domain wall is then obtained as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is domain wall position , @xmath25 is local spin angle in magnetic easy plane and @xmath26 is effective spin hamiltonian evaluated for domain wall configuration@xcite .",
    "explicitly , domain wall lagrangian is given as follows .",

    "in fact , the angle @xmath25 in bloch(y ) wall is directly driven by current and rashba interaction as indicated by the right - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eyq302 ] ) .",
    "such effect of current has been known as @xmath0 terms in the case of electron spin relaxation due to random spin  @xcite . in the present rashba case , the parameter @xmath36",
    "is then given by for bloch(y ) ( @xmath37 for bloch(z ) and neel(x ) walls ) .",
    "this result can be explained by noting that @xmath36 terms is effectively equivalent to an external magnetic magnetic field and that rashba interaction induces an effective magnetic field , which coinsides with the easy axis for bloch(y ) wall .",
    "( [ heffbly ] ) .",
    "we will see below that this coefficient @xmath36 is quite large even assuming standard semiconducting systems and reduces much the threshold current and enhances the wall velocity",
    ". the effect would be even stronger if the systems has giant rashba effect as realized in metallic surfaces@xcite .",
    "the effect of effective magnetic field due to rashba interaction in bloch(z ) and neel(x ) cases is to induce anisotropy within @xmath25-plane as seen as @xmath38 and @xmath39 terms in eqs .",

    "numerically , these second order effects are negligibly small as we will show below .",

    "it is natural since @xmath36 term is linear in @xmath58 eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta67 ] ) while other effects of rashba interaction enter at the second order ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : eyy106 ] ) ) . within our analysis , which neglects the extrinsic pinning ,",
    "threshold current of bloch(y ) is zero due to @xmath36 term . in reality , however , finite threshold will appear from pinning potential  @xcite . due to the @xmath0 term , we have obtained very large wall velocity ( like 100 m/s ) at very small current ( like 10% of intrinsic threshold current ) . in reality , gilbert damping ( @xmath61 ) is also modified by rashba interaction , which might slow the velocity @xmath62 according to @xmath63@xcite .",
    "the modification of @xmath4 is , however , second order in @xmath40  @xcite and thus small , hence the high wall velocity would remain unchanged",
    ".      behaviors of bloch(z ) and nel(x ) walls are essentially the same for present values of parameters , and are distinct from bloch(y ) wall .",
    "these walls have a plateau in @xmath62-@xmath64 curve for @xmath65 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : grawall01 ] .",
    "this plateau is due to a step motion of wall induced by the anisotropy field within @xmath25-plane arising from rashba interaction .",
    "this stepwise motion is induced above threshold current of @xmath66 , and the distance the wall moves is about 22@xmath67 regardless of current density ( for @xmath65 ) .",
    "let us see the mechanism of the plateau in detail .",
    "dynamics near intrinsic pinning threshold is described by a potential for @xmath25@xcite , obtained from the lagrangian ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : lez274 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : lex275 ] ) ) as follows : these potentials are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : grapote ] .    in the absence of current ,",
    "the potential is solely by magnetic anisotropy , and energy minimum is at @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grapote](1 ) ) . when current is applied , the potential tilts ( fig .",
    "[ fig : grapote ] ( 2 ) ) . when local minimum near @xmath69 vanishes , the wall starts to move , and this gives the intrinsic threshold current of @xmath70 in the absence of rashba interaction .",
    "@xcite when rashba interaction is switched , @xmath1-periodicity of potential is broken due to the last terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bpz305])([eq : npx306 ] ) .",
    "the way of deformation depends on bloch(z ) and nel(x ) cases .",
    "let us consider a nel(x ) wall case where the local energy barrier around @xmath71 is lowered by rashba interaction .",
    "the variable @xmath25 ( and wall ) starts to move at threshold current ( where the local minimum disappears ) , which is lowered by rashba interaction . but",
    "this motion stops if current is not large enough since @xmath25 is trapped by the next local minimum near @xmath72 , which has a large energy barrier around @xmath73 .",
    "thus in this regime , @xmath25 hops roughly by the amount @xmath74 and this corresponds by eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta35 ] ) to a wall shift of @xmath75 .",
    "this distance corresponds to the distance @xmath76 m seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : grawall01 ] .",
    "if current is sufficiently large to remove the second local minimum , the wall motion continues and terminal velocity grows ( for @xmath77 in fig . [",
    "fig : grawall01 ] ) .",
    "this is the mechanism of plateau .",
    "an interesting consequence of the step motion is an asymmetric ratchet motion .",
    "we consider a nel wall initially at @xmath78 ( we choose @xmath79 ) .",
    "when we apply a negative current , @xmath80 , the local minimum at @xmath78 is lifted and the energy barrier for right direction is lowered as we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig : grapote ] .",
    "in contrast , when current is positive , @xmath81 , the local minimum is lowered ( @xmath82 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : npx306 ] ) ) and then the effective energy barrier in the left direction becomes higher .",
    "therefore , the threshold current for step motion differs by amount @xmath83 for the two current directions ( starting from fix @xmath25 ) , and thus the wall behaves as a ratchet moving only in one way if current is small enough .",
    "these features are common for bloch(z ) wall case if @xmath78 is replaced by @xmath84 .",
    "the plateau region has finite initial velocity ( but zero terminal velocity ) .",
    "figure [ fig : bvaz ] shows the initial and terminal velocities for bloch(z ) and nel(x ) walls ( the velocity is the same for two walls ) .",
    "we see that even plateau region shows a high velocity comparable to terminal velocity above @xmath85 . for device application , motion over a distance of @xmath86 m",
    "is large enough and so the plateau region would be quite useful for low current switching .",
    "we have theoretically calculated the effect of the rashba spin - orbit interaction on the spin transfer torque .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of local spin under current was calculated using gauge transformation , and the equation of motion for domain wall was derived .",
    "we considered three cases with different magnetic easy and hard axes , where domain wall structures realized are called bloch(z ) , neel(x ) and bloch(y ) walls .",
    "we found there are three influences of rashba spin - orbit interaction , namely , inducing effective magnetic field , increasing spin transfer torque and modification of magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the major effect is that of effective magnetic field , which arises at the first - order in rashba interaction . applying voltage in @xmath5-direction",
    ", the effective magnetic field is induced in @xmath6-direction via rashba interaction . in case of bloch(y ) wall , where @xmath6-direction is the easy axis direction , we showed this field acts as a force which pushes the wall , or in other words , effective @xmath36 term arises .",
    "threshold current thus vanishes . the value of @xmath0 is large",
    "even if evaluated for common semiconductor systems , and wall velocity is enhanced greatly .",
    "in contrast , in the cases of bloch(z ) and neel(x ) , the effective field is perpendicular the easy axis ( @xmath10 and @xmath5 directions , respectively ) , and step motion of wall over a distance of @xmath87 arises at low current regime , corresponding to a change of the angle out of easy plane , @xmath88 .",
    "the current necessary for this step motion is lower than the case without rashba interaction ( by @xmath89 at @xmath90 ) .",
    "the initial velocity of step motion is high enough ( the same order as steady motion slightly above intrinsic threshold ) .",
    "wall motion in the step motion regime is asymmetric with respect to current direction , i.e. , wall behaves as a ratchet .",
    "other effects by rashba interaction , modification of spin transfer torque and anisotropy , appears at second order , @xmath91 , and are negligibly small .",
    "change of spin transfer is due to the change of effective electron spin polarization by rashba interaction .",
    "rashba interaction arises quite generally when inversion symmetry is broken , e.g. , on surface of metals doped with heavy ions@xcite .",
    "such systems would be suitable to realize quite high wall velocity at very small current we have predicted for bloch(y ) .",
