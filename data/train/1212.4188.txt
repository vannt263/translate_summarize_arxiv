    "sometimes we talk about features of theories whose existence has not been proven yet .",
    "such is the case of some statements about non - perturbative phenomena or the strong coupling regime of a relativistic qft which is known at the present only in a perturbative way .",
    "these statements refer to what is expected if we could go beyond perturbation theory .",
    "one non - proved assumption behind such statements is the _ existence of the non - perturbative model _ from which the perturbative series is derived .",
    "then , it would be desirable to have at hand a concrete simple example of such features in a relativistic quantum field theory defined in non - perturbative way",
    ". such example could be useful as a toy model illustrating expected non - perturbative phenomena of realistic theories which are known at the present only in a perturbative way .",
    "actually , there are several examples of interacting relativistic qft defined in a non - perturbative way .",
    "these models , which were obtained during the 70 , include a family of scalar field polynomial interactions , interactions of yukawa type and also an example of a non - polynomial interaction , both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the approach used for the obtention of these models is known as _ constructive quantum field theory _ ( cqft ) . see @xcite for a recent historical account .    in order to see the role of the cqft approach and its relation with the perturbative approach ,",
    "let us consider the following diagram :    @xmath7    \\1 ) in the upper left corner of this diagram , we have the formal expressions for the non - perturbative n - point functions , like those involving functional integrals or the dyson evolution operator .",
    "these expressions are meaningless for several well known reasons that will be recalled later in this note . however , in the standard exposition these expressions are formally manipulated in order to derive the taylor series ( in power of the coupling constant ) in the right upper corner of the diagram .",
    "then , we should not say that the perturbative series have been _ deduced _ from a more fundamental definition .",
    "that misleading conclusion could arise if we take seriously the standard procedure for derivation of the series , ignoring that the original expression from which the series come ( path integral or the dyson evolution operator ) has only a formal meaning .",
    "the role of the formal expressions and their manipulations consist in motivating the definition of the perturbative series .",
    "\\2 ) in this second step of the diagram , the terms of the series are still meaningless because of the standard ultraviolet divergences .",
    "so , the definition of the qft should begin in a further step .",
    "naively , we can think that it begin after the regularization procedure in the lower right hand side of the diagram , because there we have a well defined series for the n - point functions of the qft .",
    "2 ) however , the qft is not still defined in this third step , because in order to define the set of n - point functions ( which in the end are just numbers ) what is needed is a _ procedure for extracting a number from the series_. but it turns out that most of these perturbative series are _ divergent _ according with the standard convergence criterium .",
    "this fact has been addressed from early years of perturbative qft ( see @xcite for examples of @xmath2 in @xmath8 ) . without having a criterium for getting a number from the series",
    ", we have not yet defined the qft .",
    "we want to remark that the issue of the non - convergence of the series is more relevant in the qft case than in other cases ( like non - relativistic quantum mechanics ) in which we have a quantity defined by a complicated expression and an asymptotic series is derived in order to make practical computations . in the qft case ,",
    "the series are not the taylor expansion of a non - perturbative well defined n - point function .",
    "the perturbative series is all what we have .",
    "if we want to avoid the use of euphemisms , we should say that _ the perturbative approach does not define a qft even at weak regime , because the radius of convergence of these series is not small but zero _ goes to zero .",
    "the asymptotic convergence ensures that there exist a function of @xmath9 such that the difference between this function and the truncated series at order @xmath10 is of order @xmath11 .",
    "however , there is not a unique function having this series as its asymptotic expansion .",
    "so , the asymptotic convergence is not enough for defining the n - point functions .",
    "we will came back to this point later in this note ]    1 ) now , we can appreciate the achievement of cqft approach : that corresponds to the process of regularization in the left side of the diagram .",
    "we can consider it as a ",
    "non - perturbative regularization  .",
    "as we will see in this note , most of the models of cqft have been obtained by making sense of the formal functional integral expression for the n - point functions .",
    "the previous considerations show that the achievement of cqft is not merely a description in strong regime of _ existent _ models described in a weak regime .",
    "once we defined a non - perturbative expression for the n - point functions , we can make a taylor expansion and obtain a perturbative series .",
    "it could be divergent , but now we should not be so worry , because that series is not supposed to define the theory .",
    "i turns out that in some cases , like @xmath2 in @xmath0 , the taylor expansion of any n - point function coincides with the ordinary perturbative series . in those cases , we can draw the lower arrow from the left to the right , considering that non - perturbative expression arises from a suitable criterium for the resummation of the perturbative series .",
    "although the models obtained by this procedure are far of being realistic ( because they are defined in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , these constitute the first examples of the marriage of special relativity and quantum theory in the interacting case ( see the introductory comments in @xcite ) . besides the importance of knowing their existence , we think that certain steps in the construction of these models deserve to be known .",
    "that is because in the construction of these models we find certain difficulties which are not present in perturbation theory .",
    "these difficulties themselves manifest deep aspects of a relativistic qft and have a conceptual value .",
    "moreover , by looking at non - perturbative phenomena in a concrete model we could gain intuition about possible non - perturbative effects in qft models which at the present are known only in a perturbative way .",
    "however , in order to understand the construction of a single model like @xmath2 in @xmath0 ( whose construction was initiated in @xcite ) we should face the technical difficulties of several proofs and definitions , which could discourage someone who only want to have a feeling about cqft .",
    "the purpose of this note is to help in this sense , by providing a friendly introduction to the single example of @xmath2 in @xmath0 , reducing the amount of technicalities . concerning the amount of details ,",
    "this exposition is sited between introductions like @xcite and more detailed rigourous exposition , full of definitions and theorems , like the self contained book @xcite .",
    "we have written this note in such a way that even an graduate student could have a picture about cqft .",
    "although there exist good and friendly introductions like @xcite , which give a general idea without entering in the many definitions and proofs , we think that this note presents new features from the pedagogical point of view . in the next section",
    ", we will describe these features .",
    "that section could be skipped , going directly to section [ defqft ] .",
    "the community to whom this note is addressed -the one to which the authors belong- is more comfortable with the use of heuristic arguments , formal manipulation , plausibility considerations .",
    "such is the kind of language in which we want to communicate the ideas of cqft . in doing that",
    ", we also try to overcome the common prejudice consisting in associating the mathematical style of an exposition of a subject with the lack of a relevant physical contribution , considering that such exposition contains only a formalization of previous known physical concepts , which could be appreciate in a more fresh and heuristic way .",
    "as we will see , that is not the case of the cqft approach .",
    "in fact , the value of the ideas in the cqft approach could be appreciated even in a schematic and friendly exposition like this , which contains the following features :    * plausibility and heuristic arguments instead of rigourous arguments .",
    "* examples instead of definitions * sketches of the proofs instead of proofs * inclusion of pictorial descriptions and drawing of parallel with simple examples of the standard approach * restriction to simples cases instead of an exhausted exposition .",
    "we are aware that the previous features are scattered in several expositions like the book @xcite , the early book @xcite , the textbook @xcite or even inside some research papers .",
    "however , we can access to these only after avoiding several technical details .",
    "this note tries to facilitate the task by collecting this scattered pedagogical tools in a single and short exposition .",
    "we are aware that it is a difficult task to give an accurate exposition of cqft using exclusively heuristic considerations , avoiding several definitions and proofs .",
    "in fact , the achievement of cqft was precisely that of showing that interacting qft models exist as mathematically well defined objects .",
    "it is natural to ask what is left -besides an historical exposition- if we omit that aspect of the construction .",
    "it is not easy the decision about which part of the rigorous procedure could be cut without turning the exposition a mere vulgarization of the subject .",
    "however , we hope that this oversimplified exposition -which keeps selected intermediate inequalities- could still give a feeling about which are the specific difficulties towards the non - perturbative definition which we never confront in the perturbative approach    one last comment on the purposes of this note : it does not intend to be a historical account of cqft .",
    "for that purpose , a good and recent reference is @xcite .",
    "in fact , our pedagogical aims conduct to restrict the consideration on the single example of @xmath12 . accordingly",
    ", we have quoted a very short list of references .",
    "even though the example of this note does not capture all the difficulties involved in cqft , it is enough rich for a first approach .",
    "we have organized the article in several parts .    in part",
    "i , we briefly describe what a relativistic quantum field theory , the constructive approach is attempting to construct , is .",
    "in particular , in section [ inbrief ] , we make a brief summary of the difficulties for the definition of @xmath2 model in @xmath0 .",
    "those difficulties will be considered in more detail along the note .",
    "part ii introduces the statistical description of quantum mechanics in terms of gaussian processes , starting from the simple case of the anharmonic oscillator and going to free qft in @xmath0    part iii is the main part of the note .",
    "there , in sections [ dospuntossection ] , [ stabilitysection ] and [ volumeninfinito ] , it is described schematically how we can deal with three different kind of possible divergences in order to properly define the euclidean n - point functions .",
    "it concludes with the description of the steps for the proof that these well defined n - point functions fulfill the desired physical requirements .",
    "part iv is devoted to link the exposition of the previous part ( which is done in the euclidean functional approach ) with the non - perturbative hamiltonian approach and also with the usual perturbative approach .",
    "this last part is important in order to see that the models of cqft are not merely an abstract construction but the materialization of ordinary notions .",
    "we end with some remarks and a guide to a further reading .",
    "before considering any strategy , we should know what a relativistic qft we want to construct is .",
    "if the standard quantization procedure -which is the one used for the free qft- were not plagued of difficulties and ambiguities when we add interactions , the question about the definition of a relativistic qft could be considered an unnecessary worry .",
    "we could simple state :  a relativistic qft is a quantum theory obtained by the canonical quantization procedure applied to a relativistic classical field theory \" .",
    "however , as we will see , such canonical procedure is difficult to implement for an interacting classical field theory .",
    "the difficulties arise from the very beginning : _ the definition of the quantum interacting term_. in quantum mechanics , there is not such a problem in this step . in the heisenberg representation",
    ", @xmath13 is an operator valued _ function _ of the time : it takes a real number @xmath14 and gives an operator as an output .",
    "so , there is not a big problem in defining an interaction term as a suitable function of the position operator . that fact makes possible the existence of quantum mechanics systems with a non - free hamiltonian",
    "so , is not straightforward a proper definition of the interacting term .",
    "however , an appropriated restriction of the domain allows to define rigorously the interacting term as a function of the position operator . in the qft case",
    ", we will find more difficulties ]    in the qft case , @xmath15 is an operator valued _ functional _ , which takes a _ function of the spacetime _ and gives an operator as an output .",
    "the notation @xmath16 , which suggests that @xmath17 is an operator valued function , comes from an abuse of language .",
    "it comes from the existence of special types of linear distributions @xmath18 ( let us call them _ regular _ distributions ) such that their action on a function @xmath19 ( the test function ) can be written as an integral : @xmath20 , being @xmath21 a function called _ the kernel _ of @xmath18 .",
    "a non dangerous abuse of language , which simplifies the notation , consists in denoting the kernel with the same letter than the one used for the distribution .",
    "it allows to write : @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath18 stands for a distribution in the l.h.s and for a function in the r.h.s .",
    "however , a second abuse of language , a bit more dangerous than the previous one , consists in extending the previous integral expression to distributions which does not admit a kernel .",
    "such is the case of @xmath15 which is not a regular distribution . when the expression @xmath16 is written , @xmath17 is implicitly considered as a regular distribution admitting an integral representation , in which @xmath16 is smeared with the test function @xmath19 :    @xmath23    a similar abuse of language with the distribution @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 .",
    "the abuse of language consists in writing the action of this functional as : @xmath26 .",
    "here , @xmath27 is considered formally as a function , which is supposed to be the kernel of @xmath24 .",
    "however , such a kernel does not exist .",
    "the absence of a kernel for the distribution @xmath17 -hidden in the previous abuse of language- is the root of the difficulties for the definition of the interacting term in the equation of motion of the field .",
    "let us remark that e.o.m for the free scalar field , when is written properly in a distributional way , is :    @xmath28    by writing the formal expression @xmath29 and doing an integration by parts , we arrive at the usual form of the e.o.m : @xmath30 .",
    "accordingly , the wished interacting e.o.m should be something like :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is a linear distribution , constructed in terms of the original @xmath17",
    ".    however , it turns out that for the quantum field distribution such a term is difficult to construct .",
    "when a distribution @xmath18 admits a kernel @xmath21 , we can perform operations on @xmath18 by an analogous manipulation of its kernel .",
    "for instance , we can define @xmath33 as a distribution whose kernel is @xmath34 ( of course , after taking into account suitable restrictions on the space of the test functions ) . because @xmath17 is not a regular distribution admitting a kernel , it does not make sense to define @xmath35 as the distribution given by : @xmath36 .",
    "that is the beginning of all the difficulties which will be considered in this note .",
    "it is important to remark that the previous difficult is not related to the fact that @xmath37 is an unbounded operator .",
    "the unboundedness of @xmath37 leads us to make appropriated restriction on the domain in order to make sense of composition of operators like : @xmath38 . however , the last expression is different from the one needed for the definition of the interaction term @xmath39 because @xmath40 _ is not a a linear functional_. when in standard textbooks is written the interacting e.o.m containing the additional term @xmath41 , it is implicit that we should read this equation in a functional sense , considering that @xmath41 is the formal kernel of a linear distribution .",
    "we made this remark in order to stress that the difficulties behind the definition of the interaction term are not of the same nature than the ones which we find in ordinary quantum mechanics .",
    "the previous observations lead us to define an interacting qft not as the output of a procedure difficult to be implemented in general but by requiring those minimal features of a free theory that we want to keep even in presence of interaction .",
    "these features are :    * poincare covariance of the field operators * existence and uniqueness of the vacuum ( an state invariant under the poincare action ) * the inclusion of spectrum of the momentum operator in the forward light cone .",
    "* commutation of the fields @xmath42=0 $ ] for points @xmath43 spacelike separated=0 $ ] is a short version of the proper statement : @xmath44=0 $ ] is the support of @xmath19 and @xmath45 are spacelike separated .",
    "we can read this from the previous formal statement by smearing both sides of the formal equality with @xmath46 and integrating over @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this is the type of abuse of language that we have mentioned before , which does not conduct to any wrong statement if it used within certain limit .",
    "we will make use of this practical language several times along this note ]    this minimal selection of properties of the free field was expressed in a precise and organized way by arthur wightman in the middle of 50 , soon after all the ingredients of perturbation theory were introduced .",
    "these properties are known as _ garding - wightman ( gw ) axioms _ @xcite .    due to common prejudices , the term _ axioms",
    "_ , when used in an exposition of a physic theory , is associated to requirements motivated by aesthetical or mathematical reason which go beyond physical considerations .",
    "we want to emphasize that gw axioms intend to capture physical features of the free field which any qft theorist would hardly abandon .",
    "for that reason , we prefer to talk about _ general properties of a relativistic qft _ instead of gw axioms .    going back to the original question",
    ", we can say that a relativistic qft consists of a hilbert space and a family of operators fulfilling certain physical requirements encoded in the gw axioms .",
    "although it is easy to understand the statement of each of gw axioms , the task of providing examples fulfilling these axioms is very difficult .",
    "the first non trivial example was obtained during the end of 60 , as result of a remarkable work of arthur jaffe and james glimm in a sequence of papers starting in @xcite . that was done by using an approach close to the canonical quantization , consisting in defining the interacting hamiltonian in order to define the interacting field operator .",
    "although this approach has the advantage of admitting a more clear physical interpretation , we will consider another equivalent approach that was developed later , which was more suitable for practical purposes .      an important step towards a useful definition of a general relativistic qft was the investigation of the properties of the vacuum correlation functions @xmath49 , being @xmath50 the vacuum of the interacting theory .",
    "these are the so - called _ n - point functions_. from the gw axioms it is possible to derive properties of these vacuum correlation functions in a general qft .",
    "it is natural to ask about the inverse problem : if we have an infinite set of n - point functions , _ how can we know if these are the vacuum correlation of a qft fulfilling the gw axioms ? _    the answer is given by _ wightman reconstruction theorem _ @xcite .",
    "that theorem is a consequence of the identification of those properties of a set of all n - point functions @xmath51 ( for any @xmath52 ) which are enough to guarantee that these are the vacuum correlation functions of a relativistic qft . omitting the technical details and restricting to the case of scalar field ,",
    "these properties are :    * poincare invariance . *",
    "symmetry under permutation of two spacelike separated arguments .",
    "* spectral properties ( coming from the inclusion of spectrum of the momentum operator in the forward light cone ) * positivity condition : a set of inequalities expressing that the n - point functions come from an inner product in the hilbert space . * cluster property : factorization of the n - point functions when the spacelike separation of two arguments becomes large .",
    "this is related to the uniqueness of the vacuum    these requirements , together with technical requirements on the smoothness of these functions , are known as _ wightman axioms _ for the n - point functions .",
    "the proof of the reconstruction theorem is by providing the procedure for the reconstruction of the hilbert space and the field operators fulfilling the gw axioms .",
    "we have referred to @xmath53 as functions .",
    "this is again an abuse of language , that considers @xmath53 as a kernel of the distribution @xmath54 .",
    "formally , we can write @xmath55 . we should not read this expression literally , because the distribution @xmath54 does not admit a function @xmath53 such that the previous expression makes sense .",
    "this abuse of language is similar to the one made in eq .",
    "[ [ abuse ] ] .",
    "just for practical purposes , we will still talk about the n - point  functions \" ( and we will also drop the tilde for the distribution ) .      yet in the early years of pertubative qft ,",
    "j.schwinger had emphasized the practical value of using an imaginary time version of the vacuum correlation functions .",
    "it was shown by a.wightman that time ordered n - point functions fulfilling gw axioms can be analytically continued to imaginary time .",
    "formally , that extension corresponds to the change @xmath56 : the so - called _ wick rotation_. the development during the 60 of the euclidean version of the vacuum correlation functions lead to a formulation of an euclidean version of the wightman reconstruction theorem . that was done by osterwalder and schrader in 1973 @xcite .",
    "what they found was another set of requirements -called the osterwalder - schrader ( os ) axioms- to be obeyed by the analytic continuation of the n - point functions . in order to recover the wightman functions ,",
    "essentially what we have to do is a wick rotation ( @xmath56 ) . due to the early role of schwinger in this issue",
    ", the n - point functions fulfilling the ( os ) axioms are known as _ schwinger functions_.",
    "omitting technical requirements and restricting to the case of interest for a scalar qft , the requirements of the os axioms for the schwinger functions are the following :    * euclidean invariance * symmetry under any permutation of its arguments ( the euclidean translation of the second property of the wightman functions ) * reflection positivity : a set of inequalities analogous to the positivity condition , involving reflection of the time in some arguments * cluster property : factorization of the n - point functions when two arguments becomes large ( in the euclidean sense ) separated .    in the os axioms , there is not a requirement analogous to the spectral condition . in this sense , the os axioms seem to be more economical .",
    "there are several subtleties that we are omitting in this schematic presentation .",
    "one of these is related to the equivalence of the os and w axioms . in the original paper where these axioms were formulated @xcite",
    "we can find comments about modifications of these axioms which result to be more useful for the construction of models although stronger than the w axioms .",
    "after having settled the problem -what a generic relativistic qft is- we can now consider the strategy for its construction . the question is : _ how would we get a guess for the schwinger or wightman n - point functions?_. it could be desirable to have an ansatz for the schwinger function , having a chance of being successful .",
    "even more , it would be nice to have a quantization procedure",
    ". that could be the case if the chosen ansatz were dictated by a classical field theory . that ansatz exists and comes from a combination of _ feymann - kac _ and _ gell - mann - low _ formulas .",
    "the first one establishes a link between gaussian processes and quantum mechanics .",
    "there exists a close connection between expectation values in certain quantum mechanics system ( i.e. , a non relativistic particle under certain class of potential ) and statistical expectations of _ gaussian processes_. that relation is encoded in the so - called _ feynman - kac _ formula , which allows to express @xmath57 ( with @xmath58 , and @xmath18 being the hamiltonian ) as the expectation of a gaussian process .",
    "let us notice the difference in the meaning of the word `` expectation '' in each side of the relation : in the first case , it refers to an inner product of two states . in the second one",
    ", it is the mean of products of random variables having a gaussian probability distribution . because of that",
    ", the previous formula makes the connection between quantum and statistic mechanics possible .",
    "it turns out that the expectation value of the gaussian process admits a functional integration description , as an integral over a set of path starting at @xmath47 and finishing at @xmath48 weighted with certain measure .",
    "we want to emphasize that what admits a path integral representation is not @xmath59 but its analytic continuation , which roughly speaking consists on replacing @xmath14 by @xmath60 .",
    "this relation holds also in the free quantum field theory case : the n - point function , after the wick rotation , can be written as a path integral of products of gaussian processes .",
    "the correspondent measure is euclidean invariant .",
    "we see here the existence of a close relation among several different things : relativistic qft , statistical mechanics , euclidean invariance and functional integration .",
    "a more useful formula arise when we combine feynman - kac formula with the so - called _ gell - mann - low _ formula , which can be proven in certain quantum mechanics systems . in the case of an anharmonic quantum mechanics system ,",
    "gell - mann - low formula expresses interacting correlation functions of the interacting position operators in terms of free vacuum correlation functions of position operator of the harmonic case .",
    "the terms interacting ( non - interacting ) refers to the anharmonic ( harmonic ) case .",
    "this formula arises after expressing the free vacuum state in terms of the interacting vacuum . by combining gell - mann - low with feynman - kac formula",
    ", we can express the analytic extension of the interacting vacuum correlation function in terms of expectation values of gaussian processes .",
    "we will still call gell - mann - low to such combined formula .    by _ formal manipulations _ , this version of gell - mann - low formula formula can be extended to the case of an interacting scalar qft .",
    "that is :    @xmath61    the meaning of the left hand side is clear : it is the ( imaginary time version of ) the vacuum expectation value of @xmath52 products of field operators at different instant ( chronologically ordered ) , being @xmath50 the vacuum of the interacting theory ; the @xmath62 s stand for the spacial coordinates .",
    "the r.h.s has a completely different meaning : it is the mean ( expectation ) , denoted by @xmath63 , of a product of gaussian processes -denoted by @xmath64 without the hat- weighted by the exponential factor .",
    "the exponent contains the interacting potential @xmath65 , which is a spatial integral of a density .",
    "this expectation can be formally written as a functional integral with respect to a gaussian measure @xmath66 .",
    "the exponential factor is the one which perturbs the gaussian measure .",
    "has we have said , in certain quantum mechanics system - in which we have no spatial coordinates as arguments- it is a rigourous equality and the expectation of the r.h.s can be expressed as a functional integral , which is rigourously defined . in the interesting case of an interacting qft , _",
    "the gell - mann - low formula should be considered as an ansatz for schwinger n - point functions_. in case that we could prove that the n - point functions obtained in this way fulfill the os axioms , we can obtain ( via the reconstruction theorem ) the interacting correlation function fulfilling the wightman axioms .",
    "as we will see , this ansatz has a high chance to fulfill the os axioms . by using this ansatz",
    "it has been obtained several models fulfilling the wightman axioms in the 70 .",
    "the previous strategy is summarized in the following diagram :    @xmath67    so , by using a gell - mann - low formula , one follows a quantization procedure , which takes a classical theory ( given by the interacting term which perturbs the free gaussian measure ) and end up with a quantum theory .",
    "we want to emphasize that there is not guaranteed that the resulting quantum theory will exhibit a close relation to the classical theory used as a seed .",
    "for instance , it is not guaranteed that the interacting field will fulfill the operator version of the classical equations of motion .",
    "let us anticipate the steps that we should follow in order to construct the qft corresponding to @xmath2 .",
    "those are summarized in the following table and can be organized in two parts : i. dealing with divergences in order to define the candidates to be the schwinger functions .",
    "ii . verifying that these functions fulfill all the physical requirements ( os axioms ) .      in this first part",
    "we should prove that the r.h.s of the gell - mann - low formula is well defined .",
    "it is not trivial because there are three different divergences that could arise :    1 .   _",
    "definition of the interaction term _ + as we have mentioned , in spite of the so - called operator fields are operator valued _ distributions _",
    "( not just operator valued _ functions _ ) which do not admit kernel , the expression @xmath68 does not make sense .",
    "however , we can consider a family of functions @xmath69 , labeled by an integer number @xmath70 , localized ( in a precise sense to be specified later ) around @xmath47 , such that as @xmath71 , @xmath69 approaches -in a sense of distributions- to the @xmath72 .",
    "then , we can consider an operator valued distribution @xmath73 , indexed by @xmath70 , whose kernel is defined by @xmath74 . here  @xmath75  stands for the wick order .",
    "it is important to remark that @xmath76 is supposed to be the kernel of the distribution @xmath73 .",
    "it means that the action of it on a function @xmath19 is defined by @xmath77 .",
    "+ in the gaussian process description , the wick order has a counter part which will be also denoted as `` @xmath75 '' . as we will see , the result of applying @xmath75 to the @xmath52-power of a gaussian process is defined as a polynomial of the same degree @xmath52 but with the addition of lower powers .",
    "the usual wick order of a product of field operator can be written in the same way ; it is a more convenient reformulation of the usual operation consisting in moving the annihilation operator to the left .",
    "as we will see , this @xmath70 dependent gaussian process @xmath78 can be expressed as : + @xmath79 + where the coefficient @xmath80 is the expectation value : @xmath81 .",

    "expressing free measure in terms of dirichlet measure * + that is the second part of the cluster expansion , which is not very complicated .",

    "the technical reason behind this choice is the following : the cluster expansion is an expansion of the free gaussian measure @xmath66 in terms of the others almost decoupled measures . because the combination @xmath360 , rather than @xmath362 , is an expression of the type @xmath363 , it is more natural to apply the previous expansion to @xmath360 rather than @xmath362 . + we can illustrate this expansion by considering an already almost decoupled quantity .",

    "it can be proved that @xmath485 , being @xmath388 a positive constant . from this",
    ", it follows that :    @xmath486    such is an example of the so - called _ van hove phenomena _",
    "( see @xcite , pag .",
    "the name comes from an early observation by van hove about this phenomena in certain qft @xcite .",
    "that means that in the infinite volume limit , the limiting interacting vacuum state can not belong to the hilbert space of the cut - off theory .",
    "that is : @xmath487 .",
    "what can be proven is that the true vacuum lives in a non unitarily representation of the free theory . that makes the difference with the cut - off theory , in which it the interacting picture was used according with eq .",
    "[ cutoffevolution ] .",
    "the previous phenomena is a very pedagogical illustration of the _ haag theorem _ , formulated in the middle of 50 , which states that it is not possible to have a representation of canonical commutation relation ( ccr ) of an interacting theory which results to be unitarily equivalent to the ccr representation of the free field theory @xcite .",
    "such was possible for the cut - off version , because one key assumption of the haag theorem was avoided : the translation invariance .",
    "haag theorem has a conceptual value for the understanding of the obstacles for the definition of a interacting qft , clarifying the role of the cut - off .",
    "most of the standard textbook does not take into account this obstruction when the dyson operator is written , assuming the existence of the interacting picture .",
    "of course , this does not conduct to any wrong statement because this step pretend to be only an heuristic guide for the derivation of the perturbative series .",
    "the haag theorem recall us that the perturbative series has not been deduced from the meaningless non - perturbative expression but that the series constitutes the ( perturbative ) definition of the qft .",
    "this subtle is not manifest in the euclidean approach as far as we focus in the correlation functions themselves and not in the reconstruction of the qft from which these come from .",
    "the natural question after this long construction is : how is the model of this note related to the perturbative @xmath488 ? .    before answering such question ,",
    "we want to remark that the absence of a relation between both would not invalidate the previous construction .",
    "the model we have considered fulfills all the physical requirements of a relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "the agreement with the perturbative treatment is not required by the gw axioms .",
    "however , such a link would be desirable , because at the end we want to find a non - perturbative version of realistic qft -checked in the laboratory- which are formulated perturbatively .",
    "it is natural to expect that the series arising by making a taylor expansion of the n - point functions agree with the usual one .",
    "that is because the standard derivation of the perturbative series starts from the formal non - perturbative expression which was shown in the cqft to be well defined .",
    "let us go to the issue of the the convergence of this series .",
    "we know from @xcite that the series of @xmath2 are not convergent in the standard sense .",
    "however , in @xcite was proven that for the general case of all polynomial bounded from below @xmath340 the perturbative series of the schwinger functions are _ asymptotic _ to the non - perturbative expression . moreover ,",
    "this result was extended in @xcite to the case of the perturbative series of the @xmath149 matrix .- matrix is defined in terms of _ time ordered _ n - point functions .",
    "this difference introduce further complications ]    in addition to the asymptotic convergence , it was proven in @xcite that the asymptotic series converge in a _ borel sense _ to the exact schwinger functions corresponding to a polynomial of order 4 interactions .",
    "now , we have the full n - point functions ( fulfilling the general requirement of a relativistic quantum field theory ) having the perturbatives series as their asymptotic expansion .",
    "the asymptotic convergence has a practical value : this ensures that the difference between the truncated series - at order @xmath10-and the value of the n - point functions will be of order @xmath11 . the agreement with the full n - point functions will be better as far as @xmath9 goes to zero",
    "that is why these series are reliable at weak coupling .",
    "we want to stress that the practical value of the series is based on _ the existence of the full n - point functions to which these approach_. of course , that existence is the implicit assumption which justify that physicists confront the truncated series with the experience .",
    "however , the asymptotic convergence can not help to _ define _ the n - point function .",
    "that is because there is not a unique function having a given series as its asymptotic expansion .",
    "we want to emphasized that this is true for any finite range of the coupling constant , no matter how small is .",
    "that is because the radius of convergence of the series is not small but zero .",
    "we have followed the common distinction between perturbative and non - perturbative approach although we do not consider that very appropriated : that terminology has an attenuating effect , suggesting that the difference merely regards the regime in which the theory is described .",
    "however , when it is said that the perturbative approach describe the theory at weak coupling , we should have the previous observation in mind .",
    "that lead us to appreciate that the role of the construction of the non - perturbative n - point function of @xmath2 is not that of extending the regime of the perturbative theory .",
    "if we compare the cqft and the perturbative approach ( both the hamiltonian and the functional approaches ) to @xmath2 we will find important differences . the main one is the absence of the risk of divergence in step ii and iii .",
    "the reason for that difference is trivial : the difficulties in the step ii and iii are associated with the introduction of an exponential of the interaction .",
    "so , these difficulties are reduced ( some of them are eliminated ) when the exponential is expanded as a formal taylor series .",
    "most of the expositions of the perturbative approach start with the infinite volume interacting term .",
    "however , in order to see the analogous of the first risk of divergence , we should consider a _ cut - off perturbation theory_.    this first step is the only one appearing explicitly in the perturbative approach .",
    "it appears in the regularization procedure . in the particular case of",
    "@xmath2 we have not ultraviolet divergence .",
    "however , there are diverges that are eliminated by the introduction of the wick order of the fourth power of the field .",
    "usually , this trivial step is not considered as part of the regularization .",
    "the wick order in fact eliminates divergences contained in the so - called _ tadpole _ diagrams .",
    "let us point out a minor difference between the way in which this step is presented in each approach .",
    "for simplicity , let us consider both the non - perturbative and perturbative hamiltonian approaches . in the first case ,",
    "this step is done in order to make the interacting term a _ well defined operator_. in the perturbative approach , the regularization consists in making _",
    "well defined the expectation values _ involving the interacting term . in other words , in the cqf approach the regularization is done in the beginning , guarantying that any expectation value involving the interacting term makes sense .    in the particular case of @xmath2 in @xmath0 in turns out that the normal order is enough for making the interacting term a well defined operator .",
    "however , this is not mentioned explicitly in the perturbative approach .",
    "the series in the functional perturbative approach are defined by a taylor expansion of a formal exponential expression . without exponential",
    "there is not any risk of this type of divergence .",
    "the task of regularization consists merely in making finite each term of the expansion . of course",
    ", from the finiteness of the each term of the taylor expansion we could not conclude the finiteness of the integral of the exponential ( at the end , this is related to the divergent character of the series ) .",
    "we have mentioned that the integrability of the exponential in the euclidean amounts to the boundedness from below of the hamiltonian . in the hamiltonian perturbative approach",
    "we do not see such a problem because _ the series are not used for the computation of the full interacting hamiltonian_. such is only a formal expression which is written in the dyson operator at the beginning of the procedure .",
    "again , because the perturbative approach is not worried about the exact n - point functions , it is never considered the most complicated part of the non - perturbative approach : the proof of the convergence of the schwinger functions in the infinite volume limit .",
    "however , we can see a signal of this divergence in a detail of the procedure used for the definition of perturbative series .",
    "let consider the taylor expansion of the schwinger functions with a cut - off in a region @xmath89 .",
    "we will find different wick contractions in each term . among them",
    ", we will find :    1 .   @xmath489 2 .",
    "@xmath490    the first terms are finite even in the infinite volume limit .",
    "these terms correspond to integrals which have not ultraviolet divergence in @xmath0 .",
    "the second terms correspond to the so - called ",
    "bubble diagrams  .",
    "these are finite when there is a cut - off interacting term .",
    "we have mentioned that expectation of wick power of the field are under control . in the infinite volume limit , we can see that bubble diagrams like this @xmath490 diverge .    in the standard perturbative approach ,",
    "the starting point is the infinite volume limit of such expression .",
    "the reason why this divergence is declared harmless is because that arise both in the numerator and the denominator of the series for the n - point functions .",
    "this claim is improved when it is said that the n - point functions are defined by the truncated expansion , in which this diagrams are omitted .",
    "again , here enters the issue of the non - convergence of the series : if the perturbative series were convergent , the proof of the finiteness of the n - point functions , for @xmath297 , would be more easy , being reduced to checking the cancellation of bubble diagrams in the truncated series .",
    "this is one example of what we have addressed since the beginning : some of the non - trivial obstacles toward a non - perturbative definition of a relativistic invariant qft are not manifested in the perturbative approach . here",
    ", we see how the most hard obstacle ( the existence of the infinite volume limit ) is reduced to a mere cancelations of divergent factors .",
    "we want to make a minor comment on the way in which the cancellation of the infinite volume divergences is expressed in some expositions of the perturbative approach .",
    "let consider @xmath491 functions of a variable @xmath70 diverging for @xmath71 in such a way that the limit @xmath492 exists .",

    "that lead to a meaningless expression of the type @xmath384 .    in the non - perturbative approach ,",
    "we find such limit in the statement : @xmath494    we do not need to talk about  cancelation of infinities  but the limit of a quotient whose numerator and denominator diverge when @xmath297 .    because in most of the standard exposition of qft the n - point functions are not being considered as a result of a limit of a spacial cut - off version , a similar well defined limit can not be written .",
    "instead , it is simply declared that the series for the the n - point functions are defined by the truncated expansion , in which the ill defined bubble diagrams are omitted .",

    "such is an open problem , deserved to be solved . +      although we have emphasized that the ideas behind each step have a clear interpretation , it is also true that some steps ( like the proof of existence of the infinite volume limit ) become very complicated from the technical point of view .",
    "such difficulties are peculiar to each model and there is not a general way to deal with these . in the opinion of the authors , due to the small size of the cqft community little progress on the simplification of some of the steps has been done .",
    "concerning the paper @xcite in which was developed @xmath2 model in @xmath1 , it was said : `` written almost thirty five years ago , that paper has not yet fully digested and should be investigated from a more modern perspective '' @xcite .",

    ", we have not provided a precise indication of the way in which the limit should be taken .",
    "the amount of omissions of this type is more important in the issue of the infinite volume limit .",
    "however , we expect that this note provides the skeleton of the construction of more complicated models and act as a guide for the reading of a rigorous exposition . in the opinion of the authors ,",
    "a nice way to get deeper into the subject could start by reading the modern textbook @xcite , in particular chapters 11 - 13 . in this reference",
