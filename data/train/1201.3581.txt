    "hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) equations , which describe the value function in the theory of optimal control , are fully nonlinear partial differential equations , which are of second - order if the underlying control problem is stochastic .",
    "one challenge arising in the numerical solution of these equations is the presence of spurious generalised solutions of the pde which do not coincide with the value function .",
    "while these spurious solutions often possess the same regularity as the value function , they violate monotonicity properties exhibited by the value function .",
    "these properties lead to the concept of viscosity solutions .    regarding the numerical solution of hjb equations",
    ", we would like to highlight three approaches within the finite element methodology , which have been employed to ensure convergence to the value function . for a review of discrete markov chain approximations before application of the dynamic programming principle we refer to @xcite . for the method of vanishing moments we point to @xcite .",
    "for the approach by barles and souganidis we cite the original source @xcite and the recent adaption @xcite by the authors to a finite element framework .",
    "a more comprehensive outline of the literature is in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a bounded lipschitz domain in @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a compact metric space and @xmath4 be continuous . consider the bounded linear operators of non - negative characteristic form @xmath5 where @xmath6 belongs to @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath7 we assume that the final - time boundary data @xmath8 is non - negative : @xmath9 on @xmath10 . for smooth @xmath11 let @xmath12 , where the supremum is applied pointwise .",
    "the hjb equation considered is    @xmath13    let @xmath14 , @xmath15 , be a sequence of piecewise linear shape - regular finite element spaces , whose underlying meshes are strictly acute .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 , denote the nodes of the mesh with associated hat functions @xmath18 .",
    "set @xmath19 .",
    "the mesh size is denoted @xmath20 .",
    "the set of time steps is @xmath21 .",
    "let the @xmath22th entry of @xmath23 be @xmath24 .",
    "for each @xmath6 and @xmath25 find an approximate splitting @xmath26 into linear operators @xmath27 of the form @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . to impose monotonicity , select the artificial diffusion parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 as in @xcite such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "define , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 ,    [ eq : discreteop ] @xmath38    obtain the numerical solution @xmath39 by interpolation of @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath41 at time @xmath42 is defined , inductively , by interpolating the boundary data and by @xmath43 where the supremum is understood to be applied component - wise to the collection of vectors @xmath44",
    "that the diffusion coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 in are placed outside of the scalar product originates from the non - divergence form of the linear operators @xmath47 of hjb operators @xcite .",
    "this structure makes it straightforward to implement _ local _ artificial diffusion parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 , that is to implement a dependence on the nodal position @xmath48 .",
    "indeed a change of @xmath32 corresponds in the assembly of @xmath49 to a scalar multiplication of the @xmath22th row of the stiffness matrix , see .",
    "changes in the optimal artificial diffusion coefficients arise from variations of the local mesh quality and the local mesh pclet number .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 may be chosen by studying ( 35 ) in @xcite or by examining the assembled matrices of the unstabilised operators .",
    "this is in particular simple for the @xmath49 , since only the signs of off - diagonal entries need be corrected to impose a local monotonicity property , thus leading to an algorithm which can be executed row - by - row .",
    "notice that in contrast , for problems in divergence form , the stabilised diffusion coefficients @xmath50 and @xmath51 need to be determined in the whole domain and not just at nodal positions .",
    "we consider a triangular spatial domain @xmath0 with the vertices @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 and the hjb equation @xmath55 to see that equation is a hjb equation , note that the euclidean norm of the gradient satisfies @xmath56 a calculation verifies that the function @xmath57 is an exact solution of , where boundary and final - time conditions are determined by interpolation of the exact solution @xmath58 .",
    "the equation is to be solved on the time interval @xmath59 .",
    "we consider a splitting which discretises the advection term explicitly with the minimum amount of diffusion needed for monotonicity .",
    "the remaining ( linear ) diffusion is incorporated in the implicit term , observing that this leads to a time - step restriction @xmath60 .",
    "figure  [ fig : stab ] shows the supremum norm error with a constant ratio @xmath61 , showing the uniform stability of the method in this setting .",
    "figure  [ fig : art_diff_triangle ] illustrates a choice of artificial diffusion that is locally adapted to the pclet number of a coarse mesh .",
    "it is seen that diffusion is only artificially introduced in a neighbourhood of the origin , which is where the operator becomes degenerate .",
    "figure  [ fig : rates ] illustrates the rates of convergence of the numerical solution @xmath62 in the @xmath63- , @xmath64- and @xmath65-norms to the exact solution at the initial time , now using the constant ratio @xmath66 .     with constant ratio @xmath61.,width=415 ]     in the @xmath63- , @xmath64- and @xmath65-norms with constant ratio @xmath66.,width=406 ]",
    "the steady - state limit of the time - dependent eikonal equation , @xmath67 equipped with homogeneous boundary and final - time conditions , measures the distance to the boundary . due to",
    "the eikonal equation belongs to the hamilton - jacobi - bellman family .",
    "we consider the equation on a domain ( figure  [ fig : hj_surf ] , top left ) whose irregular shape leads to complicated curves on which @xmath58 is not differentiable .",
    "the height of the domain is equal to one .",
    "figure [ fig : hj_surf ] compares locally - adapted choices of the artificial diffusion parameter with global choices , and illustrates the effect of mesh refinement on the quality of the solution . to compare the quality of the numerical solutions we compare their @xmath64-norms  recalling that excessive numerical dissipation leads to a smearing out of extrema .",
    "the coarse grid solution , with @xmath68 internal nodes and with a global diffusion parameter of @xmath69 , only reaches a height of @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , a computation on the same mesh with a local diffusion parameter , with mean value @xmath71 and standard deviation @xmath72 but maximal value @xmath69 , leads to a height of @xmath73 . with one ( two ) steps of uniform refinement the number of elements increases by a factor of @xmath74 ( of @xmath75 ) and the artificial diffusion decreases to an average value of @xmath76 ( of @xmath77 ) , giving the improved value of @xmath78 ( of @xmath79 ) for the @xmath64-norm in the lower left ( right ) part of figure [ fig : hj_surf ] .",

    "the possibly remaining ( fully nonlinear ) diffusion is placed in the implicit term .    in this example",
    "the control @xmath6 of the second - order term is maximised independently of the first - order control @xmath90 ; in the sense that the optimal @xmath6 may be determined without knowledge of @xmath90 . furthermore , as @xmath91 takes locally either a positive or negative value only the controls @xmath92 and @xmath93 are ever active in the hjb equation .",
    "this is an example of the bang - bang principle .",
    "it is also reflected in the left plot in figure [ fig : fully ] , where the value of @xmath6 is plotted .",
    "black colouring signifies @xmath92 maximises the operator , whereas white colouring corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "observe that no intermediate grey values can appear .",

    "the hjb equation was solved on a sequence of successively refined meshes , with a constant set of tolerances .",
    "the linear systems were solved to a tolerance of @xmath94 by gmres . the stopping criterion for newton",
    "s method was a relative residual tolerance of @xmath95 in the maximum norm and a convergence of the iterations requirement of @xmath96 in the maximum norm .",
    "the sizes of the linear systems for the sequence of meshes were @xmath97 , @xmath68 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the respective average number of newton iterations for a single time step were @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , with respective standard deviations @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this demonstrates a weak dependence of the number of iterations needed for an individual time step on the system size , thus showing that the total number of linear systems to be solved for a complete computation depends principally on the number of time - steps .",
