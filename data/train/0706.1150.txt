    "the study of two - body hadronic @xmath2 decays provides good opportunities to test the standard model ( sm ) and further to probe possible new physics ( np ) effects beyond the sm .",
    "large numbers of b mesons have been produced at the b factories enabling accurate measurements of branching ratios and direct cp asymmetry for many modes .",
    "the @xmath7 modes , where @xmath8 denotes a vector meson , have the advantage that they provide many more observables , compared with those being measured in @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , @xmath4 ) or @xmath11 ( @xmath10 , @xmath12 ) modes , where @xmath13 denotes a pseudoscalar meson , due to spins of the final state vector mesons .",
    "since the first observation of @xmath14 by cleo collaboration  @xcite , several @xmath2 decays to two charmless vector mesons , such as @xmath0 and @xmath15 , have been reported by babar and belle collaboration  @xcite .",
    "in fact , polarization measurements for several such modes have already been reported .",
    "recent experimental results  @xcite for the @xmath4 mode , show deviations from sm expectations ; the discrepancy , commonly being referred to as the `` @xmath16 puzzle . ''",
    "the dominant quark level subprocesses for @xmath4 decays are @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) penguin processes which are potentially sensitive to np effects .",
    "many efforts have been made to resolve the puzzle  @xcite .",
    "a model - independent study shows that the experimental data strongly indicate large enhancements of both the electroweak ( ew ) penguin and the color - suppressed tree contributions  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 modes have certain inherent limitations .",
    "the four @xmath19 decay modes can experimentally yield at most 9 observables : four each of the branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries and one time - dependent cp asymmetry . clearly",
    ", the 9 observables are insufficient to determine all the 12 theoretical parameters  @xcite needed to describe these decay modes .",
    "one hence needs to make some assumptions .",
    "traditionally , assumptions have often been made on sizes of the topological amplitudes as well as on the strong phases of the different topologies .",
    "the @xmath0 modes are the @xmath20 analogues of @xmath21 modes , in the sense that the quark level processes of both modes are exactly the same .",
    "thus , it is expected that if there appear any np effects through @xmath4 , then similar np effects will appear through @xmath0 as well .",
    "however , the study of @xmath22 modes necessitates performing an angular analysis in order to obtain the helicity amplitudes .",
    "while angular analysis is often regarded as an additional complication needed due to the presence of both cp - even and cp - odd components that dilute the time dependent cp asymmetry , it can provide an impressive gain in terms of the large number of observables .",
    "we note that preliminary polarization measurement for @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 have already been done  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study @xmath0 decays in a model - independent approach .",
    "we will show that in comparison to the @xmath4 modes that yield 9 observables , the @xmath0 modes result in a total of 35 independent observables .",
    "a theoretical description of @xmath26 , however , requires 36 independent parameters , which is still one short of the number of possible observables . while the large number of observables may not seem like a distinct advantage at first",
    ", we will argue that they provide valuable insights into resolving the `` @xmath19 puzzle . ''",
    "our goal is two - fold .",
    "first , we try to determine all the relevant theoretical parameters describing the decay amplitudes of @xmath0 in a model - independent way in terms of experimental observables .",
    "these determined theoretical parameters can be compared with the corresponding model estimates .",
    "the information will be very useful for improving model calculations , such as those based on qcd factorization  @xcite , perturbative qcd  @xcite , and so on .",
    "second , we try to suggest certain tests of the sm that may reveal np effects if they appear in @xmath27 decays .",
    "any indication of np effects in @xmath0 will provide valuable hints on possible np effects in @xmath4 decays . for our goal",
    ", the decay amplitudes of @xmath0 are decomposed into linear combinations of the topological amplitudes in the quark diagram approach  @xcite .",
    "we then focus on how to extract all the theoretical parameters , including the magnitudes of the topological amplitudes and their strong phases , in terms of experimental observables .",
    "as it turns out , all the parameters can be determined in analytic forms .",
    "we also propose tests of conventional hierarchy relations between the topological amplitudes and of possible relations between the relevant strong phases within the sm .",
    "a breakdown of these relations may indicate possible np contributions appearing in @xmath0 decays , as well as in the analogous mode @xmath19 .",
    "one could hence verify if np is the source of the `` @xmath19 puzzle . ''",

    "<S> we show how @xmath3 modes can be used to obtain many more observables than those for @xmath4 modes , even though the quark level subprocesses of both modes are exactly the same . </S>",
    "<S> all the theoretical parameters ( except for the weak phase @xmath5 ) , such as the magnitudes of the topological amplitudes and their strong phases , can be determined in terms of the observables without any model - dependent assumption . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how @xmath6 can also be used to verify if there exist any relations between theoretical parameters , such as the hierarchy relations between the topological amplitudes and possible relations between the strong phases . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , if there exist reliable theoretical estimates of amplitudes and strong phases , the presence of new physics could be probed . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if the tree and color - supressed tree are related to the electroweak penguins and color - supressed electroweak penguins , it is not only possible to verify the validity of such relations but also to have a clean measurement of new physics parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a numerical study to examine which of the observables are more sensitive to new physics . </S>"
