    "this type of equation has been well studied in the literature .",

    "it also governs spherically symmetric expansion or collapse of a relativistically gravitating mass @xcite .",
    "this equation can also be thought of as a one - dimensional analog of the boson ` gauge - theory ' equations @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ mod01a ] ) has been shown to posses an unusual property which is not a general characteristic of a nonlinear equation : the frequency of oscillation of the oscillator is independent of the amplitude similar to that of a linear harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "an oscillator which possesses this property is also known as an isochronous oscillator @xcite . for",

    "@xcite ) . note that the angular frequency of oscillation @xmath2 continues to be the same as that of the linear oscillation . from this solution",
    "it is obvious that for @xmath8 , equation ( [ mod01a ] ) exhibits the property of amplitude independence of the frequency of oscillation .",
    "one can starightforwardly write down the solution of the initial value problem from the general solution ( [ mod02a ] ) .",
    "for example , for the initial condition @xmath9 , @xmath10 , from ( [ mod02a ] ) we have the solution as @xmath11}{\\sqrt{b^2+\\omega^2}-b\\cos\\left[\\omega t+\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{b}{\\sqrt{b^2+\\omega^2}}\\right)\\right]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath12 is the amplitude of oscillation .",

    "( [ mod01a]),width=529 ]    one can trace the origin of this property of equation ( [ mod01a ] ) to the fact that it can be transformed to the linear harmonic oscillator equation , @xmath16 through a nonlocal transformation , @xmath17 the solution ( [ mod02a ] ) can be obtained ( see below , equation ( [ nld05 ] ) ) from the solution of ( [ horm1 ] ) , @xmath18 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants and the frequency , @xmath2 , is independent of the amplitude .",
    "such a linearization property is one of the fascinating features associated with a class of nonlinear equations exhibiting large number of symmetries and extensive search for such linearizing transformations is being made in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "in fact , there exists a class of nonlinear oscillators which are connected to the linear oscillator equation ( [ horm1 ] ) through the following nonlocal transformation @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an arbitrary function of @xmath21 . now substituting ( [ int02 ] ) into ( [ horm1 ] )",

    "we also derive the integrals of motion and the general solution to the system of @xmath0 coupled les .",
    "we also point out that there exists another class of @xmath0 coupled nonlinear oscillators which is almost integrable in the sense that it admits @xmath48 independent integrals and reduces to a single first order nonautonomous nonlinear differential equation that can be solved numerically .",
    "the frequency of oscillation of its periodic solutions is again independent of amplitude .    in the following section",

    "generalizing the above results of the scalar system ( [ int03 ] ) to a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators of lienard type , we relate them to a system of uncoupled @xmath0-dimensional linear harmonic oscillators . for this purpose , we consider the @xmath0-dimensional anisotropic harmonic oscillator equation of the form @xmath50 where the freqencies @xmath51 are in general different .",
    "let us now introduce the nonlocal transformation @xmath52 where @xmath53 are arbitrary functions of the variables .",
    "subsituting ( [ nhorm2 ] ) into ( [ nhorm1 ] ) we get a system of @xmath0 coupled lienard type second order nonlinear oscillator equations of the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 . in the following we shall demonstrate the existence of periodic and quasiperiodic solutions with amplitude independent frequencies , @xmath51 ( isochronous property ) for the above mentioned nonlinear oscillator equation with specific forms of @xmath57 s .    to obtain the desired results , we make use of the following identities , @xmath58 derived from equation  ( [ nhorm2 ] ) .",
    "obviously the solution of the system of second order linear odes ( [ nhorm1 ] ) is @xmath59 where @xmath60 s and @xmath61 s , @xmath62 , are @xmath49 integration constants . now substituting the solution ( [ ham_sol ] ) in equation ( [ nhorm4 ] )",

    "we are also left with a first order ode of the form @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 s are given by equation ( [ mod08 ] ) .",
    "now the problem of solving the set of @xmath0 coupled autonomous second order odes ( [ nhorm3 ] ) is reduced to the problem of solving a single non - autonomous first order ode ( [ mod07a ] )",

    "equation ( [ mod07a ] ) again can not be in general solved explicitly for arbitrary form of the function @xmath80 @xcite .",
