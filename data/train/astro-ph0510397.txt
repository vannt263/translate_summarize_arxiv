    "very high energy ( vhe , defined here as @xmath5  ev ) @xmath0-rays provide the most direct view currently available into extreme environments in the local universe . as @xmath0-rays are produced by interactions of relativistic particles",
    "they represent a good probe of non - thermal astrophysical processes .",
    "relativistic electrons can produce @xmath0-rays by non - thermal bremsstrahlung or by inverse compton scattering on background radiation fields , whereas protons ( and atomic nuclei ) can generate @xmath0-rays via the decay of @xmath6s produced in hadronic interactions with ambient material .",
    "vhe @xmath0-radiation is therefore expected from the acceleration sites of particles with energies above 1  tev ( @xmath7  ev ) . in particular , @xmath0-rays can be seen as a probe of sources of nucleonic cosmic rays in our galaxy and may thus provide part of the solution to the century old puzzle of the origin of this radiation .",
    "observations of synchrotron emission in the x - ray band provide strong indirect evidence for the existence of @xmath8  tev electrons in shell - type supernova remnants ( snr ) , see for example  @xcite , and in pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) , see e.g.  @xcite . at tev energies , shell - type snrs and pulsars",
    "are established to be sources of vhe @xmath0-rays as shown by highly significant detections of the crab nebula by the whipple collaboration  @xcite or the detection of the supernova remnant rxj1713.73946 by the cangaroo  @xcite and the h.e.s.s.collaborations  @xcite .",
    "however , despite the fact that snrs are the best candidates for the acceleration of hadronic cosmic rays up to the so - called _ knee _ in the cosmic ray particle spectrum at @xmath9  ev , there is as yet no generally accepted evidence for the existence of energetic nuclei ( as opposed to electrons ) in these objects .",
    "snrs are favoured as the site of cosmic - ray acceleration for two principal reasons ; first , that a theoretically well established acceleration mechanism exists in the form of diffusive shock acceleration at snr shock fronts , for reviews see e.g.  @xcite , and secondly , that the galactic supernovae and the resulting snrs are the only known potential sources which can provide the necessary amount of energy  @xcite .    to explain the observed energy density of cosmic rays , supernova explosions must convert kinetic energy to energy of relativistic particles with a conversion efficiency @xmath10 of roughly @xmath11 .",
    "theoretical expectations for the @xmath0-ray - emission of snrs arising from hadronic interactions are given by  @xcite as @xmath12 with @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the distance to the object , @xmath15 the density of the circumstellar medium assumed to be uniform , and @xmath16 the total kinetic energy released by the supernova .",
    "this formula assumes a power - law distribution of cosmic - ray energies with a typical differential photon index of 2.1 .",
    "calculations of the photon index give a range of values around the index value 2.0 for a uniform circumstellar medium  @xcite and a rather more extended range of photon index values for supernova explosions into the wind bubble of a very massive progenitor star  @xcite .    a typical value for the fraction of kinetic energy converted into cosmic rays",
    "is @xmath17  erg  @xcite . for an snr at a distance of @xmath18  kpc expanding into an environment with a typical density of the interstellar medium of @xmath19 hydrogen atom per @xmath20",
    ", a vhe @xmath0-ray flux of 20% of that from the crab nebula is expected .",
    "the luminosity @xmath21 of such a source is @xmath22  erg  s@xmath23 in the energy range between 0.2  tev and 10  tev .",
    "one would therefore expect that with the sensitivity level of the h.e.s.s .  galactic plane survey ( down to @xmath24% of the crab flux )",
    "snrs should be detectable out to a distance of 3  kpc ( to be compared to 8.5  kpc to the centre of the galaxy ) . for larger values of @xmath15",
    ", snrs should be visible within most of the volume of the galactic disc .",
    "another potential source of vhe @xmath0-rays are pulsars and pwn .",
    "pulsars , rapidly rotating neutron stars left over after a supernova explosion , are highly magnetised and act like unipolar inductors accelerating particles .",
    "the pulsar wind interacts with the ambient medium , generating a shock region where particles are accelerated .",
    "such objects may therefore exhibit a pulsed component of radiation , from the immediate vicinity of the pulsar , together with an unpulsed component from the shock region and beyond .",
    "the crab nebula is the best - studied object of this class of particle accelerators .",
    "most of these potential galactic @xmath0-ray sources such as snrs and pulsars are associated with the formation of massive stars and therefore cluster along the galactic plane , especially concentrated in the direction towards the centre of our galaxy .",
    "91 snrs and 389 pulsars are catalogued within the inner 60@xmath2  in galactic longitude and 6@xmath2  in galactic latitude  @xcite . despite the large number of known snrs and pulsars in our galaxy , the actual number of detected vhe @xmath0-ray sources was until now limited to only a handful of objects ( for a review , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "particle acceleration to multi - tev energies may also be powered by ob stellar associations , via the _ superbubble _ mechanism ( see  @xcite for a summary ) , and also , possibly more directly via the stellar winds of member stars and subsequent interaction ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there are presently two tev sources that may be linked to such ob associations .",
    "tevj2032 + 4130 , discovered by the hegra collaboration  @xcite , and hessj1303631 , a recent discovery by h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite are in the vicinity of the ob associations cygnus  ob2 and centaurus  ob1 , respectively .",
    "both tev sources remain unidentified ( uid ) in the sense that there are as yet no clear counterparts of similar size and morphology in other wavebands .",
    "these sources might represent a new class of objects distributed along the galactic plane .    at lower energies , observations by the space based instrument egret in the gev energy range  @xcite also revealed a population of sources clustering along the galactic plane .",
    "the limited angular resolution of the egret instrument renders an identification of these sources in other wavebands very difficult and most of these objects remain as yet unidentified .    for all these reasons ,",
    "a survey of the inner part of the galaxy provides an efficient way to search for @xmath0-ray emission in order to investigate properties of source classes and search for yet unknown types of galactic vhe @xmath0-ray emitters .    at tev energies the milagro water - cherenkov detector  @xcite and the tibet air - shower array  @xcite",
    "have been used to perform large - scale surveys .",
    "while these instruments have the advantage of a very wide field of view ( @xmath25  sterad ) , the sensitivity obtained by these surveys is rather limited , reaching a flux limit comparable to the flux of the crab nebula , @xmath26  @xmath27  s@xmath23 ( for @xmath28  gev ) , in one year of observations . both surveys covered @xmath29  sterad of the northern sky and revealed no previously unknown significant @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "however , some evidence for @xmath0-ray emission was found by the milagro collaboration from a region in the cygnus constellation and another region close to the crab nebula  @xcite .",
    "recently the detection of diffuse emission from the galactic plane with milagro has been reported  @xcite .",
    "the hegra instrument was the first array of imaging air cherenkov telescopes to be used to survey a part of the galactic plane  @xcite .",
    "the range of galactic longitudes ( @xmath30 ) @xmath31 was observed ; due to the location of hegra in the northern hemisphere and the resulting large zenith angles for observations of the centre of the galactic plane , the sensitivity was reduced for the central part of the galaxy and the energy threshold of the observations ranged from 500  gev to 7  tev .",
    "no sources of vhe @xmath0-rays were found in this survey , and upper limits between 15% of the crab flux for galactic longitudes @xmath32 and more than 30% of the crab flux in the inner part of the milky way were derived .    until the completion of the high energy stereoscopic system ( h.e.s.s . )",
    "@xcite in early 2004 , no vhe @xmath0-ray survey of comparable sensitivity of the southern sky , or of the central region of the galaxy has been performed . in this paper",
    "we describe a survey of this region with h.e.s.s .  between may and july 2004 at a flux sensitivity down to 2% of the crab flux .",
    "the initial results from the survey including the description of the discovery of eight new sources have been summarised in  @xcite .",
    "this work presents detailed results on these eight sources .",
    "in addition we report the detection of six additional weaker sources of vhe @xmath0-rays extending to lower flux levels than our previous analysis .",
    "spectral information and a more detailed study on the morphologies for all sources is provided .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : after a description of the h.e.s.s . instrument ( section  [ instrument ] ) and the galactic survey dataset used in this paper ( section  [ dataset ] )",
    ", the data analysis technique is presented in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "section  [ characteristics ] gives a detailed description of the individual sources along with possible counterparts in other wavebands , followed by a discussion of the results in section  [ discussion ] and some conclusions in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "h.e.s.s .  is a system of four imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , located in the khomas highlands of namibia at a height of 1800  m above sea level . h.e.s.s .",
    "has unprecedented sensitivity in the energy range from 100  gev to several tens of tev .",
    "the imaging cherenkov technique exploits the cascade of secondary particles produced in interactions of primary @xmath0-rays with molecules in the earth s upper atmosphere .",
    "these secondary particles emit cherenkov light , which can be imaged by the cherenkov telescopes .",
    "the energy and direction of the primary @xmath0-rays can be reconstructed based on the intensity and shape of the detected cherenkov light distribution .",
    "multiple views of the same particle shower with several telescopes improve background rejection capability and the angular and energy resolution of the instrument , in comparison to a single telescope .",
    "therefore , h.e.s.s .",
    "observations are performed in a stereoscopic mode , whereby at least two of the four telescopes must be triggered by a shower for an event to be recorded  @xcite .",
    "the telescopes each have a mirror area of 107  m@xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the cherenkov light is focussed onto fast 960  pixel photo - multiplier cameras , which record the cherenkov light images  @xcite .",
    "the 5@xmath2  diameter field of view of the h.e.s.s .",
    "cameras is the largest of all imaging cherenkov detectors and is especially suited for the study of extended sources and the search for unknown sources in surveys .",
    "this was part of the original design concept for the h.e.s.s .",
    "telescope system  @xcite .",
    "the h.e.s.s .  instrument has an energy threshold of @xmath8  gev at zenith before selection cuts , an angular resolution of @xmath34 for individual @xmath0-rays and a point source sensitivity of @xmath35  @xmath27  s@xmath23 above 1  tev ( 1% of the flux from the crab nebula ) for a 5@xmath4 detection in a 25  hour observation . the sensitivity of h.e.s.s .  and the capability to map large extended sources has been demonstrated by the resolved images of the snrs rxj1713.73946  @xcite and rxj0852.04622  @xcite .",
    "the serendipitous detections of the unidentified source hessj1303631 in the field of view of the binary pulsar psrb125963 and of the composite supernova remnant g0.9 + 0.1  @xcite in the field of view of the galactic centre source hessj1745290  @xcite demonstrate the advantage of a large field of view .",
    "this large field of view implies that some sources are observed up to 2 degrees off the optical axis of the telescope system .    to illustrate the off - axis performance within the field of view of h.e.s.s . , figure  [ fig::offset ] summarises some basic parameters as a function of the offset .",
    "the left panel shows the @xmath0-ray efficiency relative to on - axis pointing , derived from monte - carlo simulations for two different zenith angles along with measurements of the crab nebula .",
    "the plot shows a weak dependence of the @xmath0-ray efficiency on zenith angle and reasonable agreement between monte - carlo simulations and data .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig::offset ] shows the angular resolution of h.e.s.s .",
    "( specified by the 68% containment radius of the point spread function ( psf ) ) versus offset in the camera for observations at two different zenith angles .",
    "it is evident that the angular resolution is better than 0.1@xmath2  and is reasonably constant in the inner 1.5@xmath2  of the field of view .",
    "the survey was conducted in the galactic longitude band @xmath36 around @xmath37 .",
    "runs of 28  minutes duration were taken at pointing positions with a spacing of 0.7@xmath2  in longitude in three strips in galactic latitude : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for the data analysis runs were selected based on weather and hardware conditions .",
    "95  hours of quality - selected data were taken in the scan mode between may and july 2004 .",
    "the observation schedule was optimised so that individual pointings were conducted near culmination , resulting in the smallest zenith angles accessible .",
    "promising source candidates were re - observed between july and october 2004 , yielding a further 30 good - quality hours of data .",
    "for the analysis described in the following , additional pointed observations of snr rxj1713.73946 and of the galactic centre region are included .",
    "the total data set presented here amounts to 230  hours after quality selection , the mean zenith angle of all observations is 26@xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig::acceptancetime ] shows a map of exposure for this data set , expressed in terms of an equivalent number of hours observing a source at the centre of the field of view .",
    "as can be seen from figure [ fig::acceptancetime ] , the exposure is not uniform with peak exposures in the regions around rxj1713.73946 and the galactic centre .",
    "this irregular exposure results in an uneven sensitivity for the detection of new sources .",
    "the sensitivity of the survey in galactic latitude ( averaged over the whole longitude range ) is shown in figure  [ fig::sensitivity ] .",
    "for @xmath40 the sensitivity is rather flat at a level of 2% of the flux from the crab nebula , and deteriorates rapidly at @xmath41@xmath2  from the galactic plane .",
    "the flux sensitivity above 200 gev is @xmath42% worse for a source with photon index @xmath43 compared to one with @xmath44 .",
    "following calibration of the data  @xcite , the standard h.e.s.s .",
    "event reconstruction scheme was applied to the dataset . after tail - cut image cleaning and a hillas parametrisation algorithm ,",
    "the direction of the shower axis was reconstructed by intersection of the major axes of the hillas ellipses .",
    "h.e.s.s .",
    "standard cuts  @xcite on the width and length of these ellipses ( scaled to the width and length expected from monte - carlo simulations ) were used to suppress the hadronic background .",
    "an additional cut on the image size @xmath45  photo - electrons ( p.e . ) yields optimum sensitivity for weak sources provided that source spectra are not significantly steeper than that of the crab nebula .",
    "they result in an angular resolution of 0.08@xmath2  ( 68% containment radius ) and an energy threshold of 250  gev . to reduce systematic effects which affect images close to the edge of the camera ,",
    "only events reconstructed within a maximum distance of 2@xmath46 from the pointing direction of the system were used for this analysis .",
    "the survey region was divided ( a priori ) into a grid of trial source positions with grid points spaced by 0.04@xmath2 , a value well below the angular resolution of the instrument . for each grid point in the scan region , the on - source signal was calculated by summing up all events within a circle of radius @xmath47 , ( or @xmath48 deg@xmath49 ) , where @xmath50 denotes the angular distance between the reconstructed event direction and the grid point .",
    "this cut is appropriate for slightly extended sources with respect to the angular resolution of the instrument and was chosen a - priori , since it is optimal for the detection of @xmath0-ray sources with the average observed size of galactic snrs  @xcite .",
    "a search for very extended sources ( relative to the angular resolution ) using a larger @xmath51 cut yields similar results . a similar search for point - like sources with a @xmath52 deg@xmath49 cut revealed a subset of the sources presented here and , additionally , the point - like source hessj1826148 , which is associated with the microquasar ls5039 . the discovery of this source is reported elsewhere  @xcite .    the background for each grid point was estimated using two different techniques .",
    "the standard h.e.s.s .",
    "background estimation method counts background events in a ring around each grid point with a mean radius of 0.5@xmath2  and an area 7 times that of the on - region to estimate the background level .",
    "the standard ring radius of 0.5@xmath2  was increased to 0.6@xmath2  ( again a priori ) to improve sensitivity to extended sources . using appropriate weight factors",
    ", this background determination takes into account the difference in system acceptance and exposure for the on- and the off - regions  @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique uses the _ template _",
    "approach , where the background level is estimated using events that are normally rejected by the cosmic - ray background rejection criterion based on the scaled image width and length , but with reconstructed directions falling within the on - source region  @xcite .",
    "the normalisation in this case is determined by the overall ratio of events in both cut regimes , taking into account the ratio of relative acceptances in the two regimes .",
    "figure [ fig::background ] shows the correlation of the background level estimated for each grid point from the ring background and from the template background method .",
    "the slope of the major axis of the distribution is 1.007 .",
    "this shows that the background estimates are consistent within 1% .",
    "the template background seems to slightly underestimate the background in comparison to the ring background .",
    "the ring background technique should therefore give a more conservative estimation of the significances of the new sources .",
    "in the following the ring background estimation method will be used as the standard method , since it is a robust method in which linear gradients in the system acceptance cancel out .    from the on - counts , the background level , and the relative background acceptance in the system , a statistical significance can be determined for each grid point in the map , testing the existence of a @xmath0-ray source at the position of that grid point ( using the approach of  @xcite ) .",
    "a number of significant sources are detected and table  [ table::excess ] gives the on - counts , the background level as derived from the ring background determination method ( after accounting for the difference in acceptance and in the area between the on - source and the off - source region ) and the resulting number of @xmath0-ray excess events .",
    "since the map contains a large number of test positions , this significance has to be corrected according to a `` trial factor '' .",
    "this trial factor accounts for the increased probability of finding a fake signal with an increased number of test positions for which a significance is calculated . using a monte - carlo simulation of the technique applied to the survey data ( including a realistic exposure map and randomly generating the events for each run from the acceptance function of that run )",
    ", it has been found that this trial factor is somewhat lower than the number of points for which a significance is calculated , i.e.  the number of grid points in the map ( @xmath53 ) , since the excess counts for adjacent grid points are correlated , given that the integration radius is larger than the grid spacing .",
    "for uncorrelated grid points one would have exactly the factor @xmath15 .",
    "for the calculation of post - trials significances we conservatively assume that the number of trials is equal to the number of bins @xmath15 .",
    "figure  [ fig::significancedistribution ] shows the distribution of significances for all grid points in the map ( solid black ) .",
    "the large positive tail to the distribution can be attributed to the existence of @xmath0-ray - sources .",
    "the much smaller tail of negative significances is due to the existence of @xmath0-ray sources in the regions used for background estimation .",
    "this effect has been minimised in a second iteration in which regions of significant @xmath0-ray excess are excluded as background regions .",
    "also shown in dashed blue is the distribution of significances for a region in the map without significant sources ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "this distribution has been scaled to have the same peak height as the distribution of significances for all grid points ( black ) . a gaussian fit to this",
    "distribution yields a mean of @xmath56 with an rms of @xmath57 , in tolerable agreement with the expected normal gaussian distribution given the possibility of undetected @xmath0-ray - emission in the on - source or off - source regions .",
    "the distribution of significances for a monte - carlo simulation of the survey without @xmath0-ray sources , using the same analysis procedure as for data , is shown with red points .",
    "this distribution has also been scaled to have the same peak height as the distribution of significances for all grid points ( black ) and is consistent with a normal gaussian , demonstrating that the analysis technique behaves as expected .",

    "the three remaining sources ( hessj1614518 , hessj1702420 and hessj1708410 ) have no plausible snr , pulsar or egret counterpart and may belong to a new source class .",

    "however , the possibility remains that these new sources are associated with snrs or pwn as yet undiscovered at other wavelengths .",

    "the only galactic sources detected above 10  gev are pulsars , for which the sparse photons at these energies correlate with the location and the pulse profile at lower egret energies  @xcite .",
    "the bulk of photons above 10  gev have to be attributed to galactic ( and extra - galactic ) diffuse emission .    when comparing the egret sources with the h.e.s.s",
    ".  galactic plane survey result , it should be noted that even if an egret source spectrum is measured up to 10  gev , more than a decade in energy is left uncovered below the h.e.s.s .  energy threshold .",
    "indeed , only a minor fraction of the h.e.s.s .",
    "sources coincide within the considerably larger location uncertainty contours of egret sources .",
    "these sources are hessj1640465 , hessj1745303 , and hessj1825137 , which are consistent with the 95% location uncertainty of the unidentified egret sources 3egj16394702 , 3egj17443011 , and 3egj18261302 . in total 17 egret sources",
    "are catalogued within the h.e.s.s .",
    "survey region .",
    "taking into account the 95% positional error contours , they cover an area of 9.76 deg@xmath49 , resulting in a chance positional coincidence of a given h.e.s.s .",
    "source with an egret source of 32% . a correlated galactic latitude distribution of the egret and h.e.s.s .",
    "sources , concentrated near the galactic plane , could increase this probability .",
    "physical arguments suggest that the egret source population and the set of new h.e.s.s .",
    "sources might be of different kinds .",
    "while the brightest @xmath0-ray pulsars can be directly traced up to @xmath96  gev , egret data indicate the existence of gev - cutoffs already in the 210  gev range  @xcite .",
    "the brightest pulsars , and several unidentified egret sources with pulsar - like characteristics deviate from single power - law spectral representations  @xcite , and are significantly better fitted when introducing high - energy spectral cutoffs .",
    "gev - cutoffs are indeed predicted from multi - frequency modelling of the @xmath0-ray emission of pulsars  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the emission of these unidentified egret sources may not extend up to the h.e.s.s.energy range . from crab measurements by celeste  @xcite , consecutively continuing the egret gev - data , a characteristic change in the emission properties of the pulsar became apparent : pulsed emission is diminished or entirely absent , leaving only a steady emission component , in case of crab attributed to the pwn .",
    "if the majority of egret sources in the galactic plane may be identifiable with @xmath0-ray pulsars , this population will overlap with the h.e.s.s.energies only if a plerionic emission components exist .",
    "for pwn there are theoretical grounds to expect in some cases a displacement of the @xmath0-ray emission from the pulsar powering the nebula  @xcite . in such cases",
    "the association becomes more difficult to establish .",
    "considering only pulsars with sufficient spin - down luminosity to explain the measured vhe @xmath0-ray flux , four of the new sources have possible associations with pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "however , only in the case of hessj1825137 , is there so far a convincing multi - wavelength argument for the offset from the pulsar position in the sense that an x - ray pwn offset in the source direction has been detected .",
    "the sensitivity shown in figure  [ fig::sensitivity ] is that for point - like ( @xmath97@xmath2 ) sources . the sensitivity of h.e.s.s .",
    "decreases with increasing source size : @xmath98 , where @xmath99@xmath2  for the analysis described here . as a consequence",
    "there is a bias in this survey against very extended sources . in particular , for sources larger than the size of the ring used for background estimation ( 0.6@xmath2  radius ) the flux threshold increases dramatically since the off - source region used for the background estimation then also contains flux from the source .",
    "this effect also introduces a bias against close - by sources , potentially resulting in a latitude distribution narrower than that of the parent population .",
    "an additional consequence of the ring background technique is that this survey is insensitive to weak diffuse emission .",
    "a search for diffuse emission in this dataset will be reported elsewhere .",
    "another effect that has an impact on the width of the latitude distribution is source confusion .",
    "assuming that all sources lie on the galactic plane and using the mean rms size of @xmath100@xmath2  of the new sources , the chance probability of an overlap between any two of the 17 sources in the scan region is estimated to be 6% .",
    "therefore , whilst source confusion could in principle widen the observed latitude distribution , we expect this effect to be small .",
    "it is apparent from table  [ table::counterparts ] that the most likely associations of the @xmath0-ray sources lie at rather large distances ( i.e.  410  kpc ) within our galaxy , and exhibit luminosities in the range 320 @xmath101  erg  s@xmath23 .",
    "three of the new sources are located in a region of the galactic plane that lines up with the 3  kpc arm tangent region ( hessj1640465 , hessj1632478 and hessj1634472 ) , which hints at a distance of 8  kpc . hessj1614518 and hessj1616508 are at a position in the plane that lines up with the norma spiral arm .",
    "this arm appears to be one of the most important massive star forming regions of the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "as it is clear from table  [ table::counterparts ] it is difficult to explain the new vhe sources as belonging to a single source population .",
    "it is therefore not straight - forward to interpret the global properties of the sources .",
    "however , conventional galactic particle accelerators such as young pulsars and snrs have similar spatial distribution within the galaxy .",
    "molecular material and hence regions of star formation cluster rather close to the galactic plane , with an exponential scale height of @xmath102100  pc  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-ray sources associated with stellar death ( and birth ) ( snrs , young pulsars , ob associations ) should therefore follow similar distributions ( see figure  [ fig::latdistribution ] ) . to compare such candidate populations with the observed galactic latitude distribution of the survey sources assumptions",
    "must be made about the luminosity distribution , the radial distribution in the galaxy , and the intrinsic size of the sources .",
    "a simple monte - carlo simulation shows that the measured @xmath66 distribution of sources is rather insensitive to the assumed luminosity distribution .",
    "taking the example case of snrs as being a single class of counterparts to the new sources , it is possible to derive the expected properties of the detected @xmath0-ray sources .",

    "assuming the radial distribution of snrs suggested by @xcite , the measured number of the vhe @xmath0-ray sources is consistent with expectations for plausible values of conversion efficiency into accelerated particles @xmath105 and ism density @xmath19  @xmath89 . as the sensitivity of the survey is reduced for extended sources , some assumption of the intrinsic size distribution of sources must be made . here",

    "<S> we report on a survey of the inner part of the galactic plane in very high energy @xmath0-rays with the h.e.s.s .  cherenkov telescope system . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic plane between @xmath1@xmath2  in longitude and @xmath3@xmath2  in latitude relative to the galactic centre was observed in 500 pointings for a total of 230  hours , reaching an average flux sensitivity of 2% of the crab nebula at energies above 200  gev . </S>",
    "<S> fourteen previously unknown sources were detected at a significance level greater than 4@xmath4 after accounting for all trials involved in the search . </S>",
    "<S> initial results on the eight most significant of these sources were already reported elsewhere  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we present detailed spectral and morphological information for all the new sources , along with a discussion on possible counterparts in other wavelength bands . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution in galactic latitude of the detected sources appears to be consistent with a scale height in the galactic disk for the parent population smaller than 100  pc , consistent with expectations for supernova remnants and/or pulsar wind nebulae . </S>"
