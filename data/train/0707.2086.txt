    "big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) together with galactic cosmic - ray nucleosynthesis ( gcrn ) has revealed a consistent picture for the origin and evolution of deuterium , helium , lithium , beryllium and boron .",
    "this combination involves very different aspects of nucleosynthesis including primordial , non - thermal and stellar nucleosynthesis , all of which are correlated through cosmic and chemical evolution .",
    "there is one single free parameter in the standard model of bbn , the baryon density , and that has now been determined with high precision by wmap @xcite rendering bbn a parameter - free theory @xcite .",
    "the derived bbn value of d / h is in agreement with that deduced from observations ( d / h ) = @xmath1 ( * ? ? ? *  and references therein ) .",
    "this is a key success of big bang cosmology .    unlike deuterium , which is observed in high redshift quasar absorption systems , the libeb abundances are primarily determined from observations of the atmospheres of stars in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "low metallicity stars ( pop ii stars ) offer various constraints on the early evolution of those light elements , assuming that time and metallicity are correlated . until recently",
    ", the evolution of the abundances of 6 , 7 , @xmath2be , and @xmath3b could be explained in the context of gcrn along with the primordial value of 7 from bbn which forms the _ spite _ plateau @xcite for stars with metallicity lower than about [ fe / h ] = -1.5 ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the first observations of li at [ fe / h ] @xmath4 @xcite were entirely consistent with the predicted abundances of li / li @xmath5 in standard gcrn models @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , recent observations have led to two distinct li problems .",
    "first , given the baryon density inferred from wmap , the bbn predicted values of li are li / h = @xmath6 @xcite , li / h = @xmath7 @xcite , or li / h = @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "these values are all significantly larger than most determinations of the lithium ( li + li ) abundance in pop ii stars which are in the range @xmath9 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these values are also larger than a recent determination by @xcite based on a higher temperature scale .",
    "this is still an open question which will not be addressed in this paper .",
    "second , recent observations of li at low metallicity @xcite indicate a value of [ li ] @xmath10 which appears to be _ independent _ of metallicity in sharp contrast to what is expected from gcrn models , and is more consistent with a pre - galactic origin . while bbn does produce a primordial abundance of li , it is at the level of about 1000 times below these recent observations @xcite .",
    "gcrn builds on the bbn value yielding a 6 abundance which would be proportional to metallicity .",
    "thus , an additional source of 6 is required at low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] < -2 ) and different scenarios have been discussed which include the production of liduring the epoch of structure formation @xcite or through the decay of relic particles during the epoch of the big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter rvoi , rvoii ) , we investigated the possibility of high - redshift _ cosmological cosmic - rays _ ( ccrs ) , accelerated by the winds of pop iii sn , and thus related the non - thermal production of 6 to an early population of massive stars .",
    "the star formation history was computed in the framework of the hierarchical structure formation scenario , as described in @xcite .",
    "rvoii showed that the production of liby the interaction of ccrs with the igm provides a simple way to explain the observed li  abundance , within a global hierarchical structure formation scenario that accounts for reionization , the star formation rate ( sfr ) at redshift @xmath11 , the observed chemical abundances in damped lyman alpha absorbers and in the intergalactic medium .",
    "the additional amount of li  produced is negligible , so that the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction and the observed spite plateau is not worsened .    here",
    ", we examine the consequences of the ccr production of 6 on the abundances of the related be and b isotopes .",
    "the ccr spallation of p , @xmath12 on cno in the igm as well as the reverse process of the spallation of cno in ccrs on h and he in the igm are considered in computing the igm abundances of the libeb elements . as a consistency check , we also compute the abundance of d in the igm and the extra - galactic @xmath13-ray background ( egrb ) produced by the same processes @xcite .",
    "as in rvoii , we assume that the igm abundances act as a prompt initial enrichment ( pie ) for the halo stars when the galaxy forms ( at @xmath0 ) .",
    "the observed li  plateau at low metallicity is assumed to originate solely from production in the igm by those cosmological crs , which sets the single free parameter , taken to be the fraction of energy available for ccrs .",
    "in addition , we include two low energy components , as proposed by @xcite ; the neutrino process @xcite and low - energy interactions of c , o and @xmath12 with the ism ( lec )",
    ". both should be operative in high redshift structures and produce libeb .",
    "these processes are , however , confined within the environment of the star and affect mainly the ism , while the standard crs escape efficiently into the igm .    in , an overview of the basic ccr scenario is given .",
    "we describe the igm production of libeb (   [ s : ccr - prod ] ) , discuss the escape efficiency of ccrs (   [ s : escape ] ) , and our inclusions of the primary @xmath14-process and lec components (   [ s : lec ] ) .",
    "in , our results for the igm abundances of @xmath15li (   [ s : lithium ] ) , d (   [ s : d ] ) , beb (   [ s : beb ] ) and @xmath13-rays (   [ s : gamma ] ) are given , and then summarized in .",
    "the assumed cosmology is @xmath16cdm defined by @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "our modeling of the nucleosynthesis by ccrs is based on the global scenario for hierarchical structure growth and cosmic star formation , as developed by @xcite .",
    "this model is based on an press & schechter formalism and satisfies a number of observational constraints such as star formation rates at @xmath11 , reionization at high @xmath21 , as well as the abundances of several trace elements in the ism and igm .",
    "once the initial mass function ( imf ) and sfr are specified , one can compute the supernovae driven outflows which enrich the igm .",
    "the same supernova rate will be used here to derive the flux of ccrs .",
    "the efficiency for the escape of these ccrs is discussed below in .",
    "the models considered in @xcite were all bimodal models of star formation .",
    "each model contained a normal mode of stars with masses between 0.1 m@xmath22 and 100 m@xmath22 and an imf with a near salpeter slope .",
    "the sfr of the normal mode peaks at @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to a normal mode of star formation there is a massive component which dominates star formation at high redshift . here , we consider two possibilities for the massive mode .",
    "first , as in rvoii , we consider a model where the massive mode corresponds to stars with masses in the range 40 - 100 @xmath24 ( so - called model 1 ) .",
    "these stars terminate as type ii supernovae .",
    "second , we consider a model where the massive mode corresponds to stars with masses in the range 270 - 500 @xmath24 ( so - called model 2b ) .",
    "these massive stars are assumed to terminate as black holes through total collapse and do not contribute to any metal enrichment in either the ism or igm .",
    "it is , however , unclear whether these implosions are responsible for the acceleration of cosmic rays .",
    "energy must get out during the collapse , but this may be entirely in the form of neutrinos and gravitational waves .",
    "we have not included any contribution to the flux of ccrs from the massive component of model 2b stars .",
    "ccrs are made by elements initially present in the ism , accelerated by the sn shock - waves , and then expelled from the structures .",
    "nucleosynthesis occurs when they finally interact with the elements present in the igm .",
    "we compute the energy and flux of ccrs as in rvoi and rvoii .",
    "the fraction of the total energy injected in ccrs is @xmath25 ( where 99%  of the energy is emitted in the form of neutrinos ) , with an efficiency @xmath26 for cr acceleration . the total kinetic energy @xmath27 per sn in crs is , @xmath28 ergs for stars which leave neutron stars as remnants , i.e. stars with masses , 8 m@xmath29 m@xmath30 and are associated with pop ii . for more massive stars , up to 100 m@xmath31 , we take the total energy of core collapse to be 0.3 times the mass of the he core , with @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "thus , for the massive mode ( associated with pop iii ) of model 1 , which is dominated by 40 m@xmath31 stars , we have @xmath33 ergs . in rvoii , @xmath26 , which within reason is a free parameter for each model ,",
    "was taken to be 0.15 for model 1 .",
    "as in rvoi and rvoii , the source spectra are taken to be power laws in momentum , @xmath34 ( @xcite , or @xcite for a brief introduction ) . the cr proton flux is normalized to the total kinetic energy injected by the sn .    in our scenario , we have considered a simplified picture for ccr generation , where the source and propagated spectra are equal . as in the rvoi and rvoii analysis , where the cr spectral index @xmath35 was assumed",
    "this is consistent with the limited scope of our scenario , where the details of injection , propagation in the structure , escape , and propagation in the igm are advantageously described by a single phenomenological source / propagated power law spectrum .",
    "we will come back to and comment further on this issue in our conclusions .    given this phenomenological approach ,",
    "we choose to stay as close as possible to existing data . because of the lack of a sound description of cr spectra at all redshifts , a possible and conservative choice for describing the cr spectra of heavy elements ( cno ) is to match the observed present - day galactic cr spectrum .",
    "indeed , a departure from a pure power law is observed at low energy : this is caused by the well - understood galactic confinement and preferential destruction of heavier elements compared to lighter ones ( see , e.g. , fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "for simplicity , we assume a pure power law for @xmath36 and @xmath12 with spectral index @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , the spectrum for cno is modeled as a broken power - law : @xmath39 based on observations of the h , he and cno spectra ( see fig.13 in * ? ? ? * ) , we set @xmath40 , and @xmath41 with @xmath42  gev / n .",
    "such a parametrization will prove to be crucial to the resulting beb production (   [ s : beb ] ) .    in the following ,",
    "all ccrs above a given energy @xmath43  mev / n are assumed to efficiently escape from the structures .",
    "the abundance pattern in the crs is linked to the abundance in the ism . in galactic cosmic rays ( gcrs ) , significant deviations for some elements",
    "are observed due to differing acceleration efficiencies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the same behavior is assumed for ccrs .",
    "it is convenient to define the abundances of different species @xmath44=\\{he , c , n , o } relative to h in ccrs , the ism and the igm : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ccr flux for species  @xmath44 and @xmath47 is the respective number density .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is related to the interstellar abundances by , f_i = _ i f_i , [ eq : eta_i ] and @xmath49 is matched to the abundance pattern observed in the galactic cosmic ray fluxes ( see table 1 of @xcite ) : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "abundances in the ism ( @xmath54 ) and in the igm ( @xmath55 ) are computed as in @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will always assume @xmath56 .",
    "the abundances of metals , on the other hand , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , do depend on @xmath21 .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath55 are ingredients to the igm production and their evolution with redshift for c and o are displayed in for the two sfr models considered .",
    "note that the contributions of reactions involving the ccr flux of n ( not shown in the figure ) are always negligible compared to c and o. note that the cr fluxes and igm enrichment in model 2b evolve more slowly than in model 1 , due to the presumption that the very massive pop iii stars associated with model 2b , provide neither metal enrichment nor a source for cosmic rays . in model 2b , both originate from the normal mode , whereas in model 1 , crs and metal enrichment receive contributions from the normal mode and massive mode at higher redshift .",
    "( 9,9 )      in rvoi and rvoii , the efficiency of secondary cr escape from the ism of early galactic structures ( hereafter simply `` galaxies '' ) into the igm was always assumed to be high .",
    "however , as shown in rvoii , the effects of cr heating of the igm , required a certain degree of confinement of cr propagation and 6 production to regions that will develop into the warm - hot igm . here",
    "we present a physical justification of these assumptions .    in accordance with @xcite , we can evaluate the mass @xmath59 of a typical galaxy at redshift @xmath21 as the mass - weighted average over the press - schechter mass function of collapsed dark matter halos @xmath60 , |m(z)=_m_^ dm m^2 f_ps(m , z ) / _ m_^ dm m f_ps(m , z ) , where @xmath61 .",

    "we can see that the timescales for cr escape out of the ism by either diffusion or advection are always much shorter than @xmath77 at all @xmath21 , with diffusion dominating over advection above @xmath78 .",
    "this justifies the assumption of rvo2 regarding efficient cr escape into the igm .",

    "while the timescales for advection and diffusion indicate that crs eventually escape to the igm , it is important to consider the spallation timescales to determine whether there are any potential effects on the cr spectrum . a simple estimate of the spallation timescale , @xmath79^{-1}$ ] , shows that spallation indeed occurs on timescales shorter than those associated with escape . noting that the total destruction cross - section is roughly constant above a few hundred mev and using @xmath80 40 mb , @xmath81 80 mb , and @xmath82300 mb , one finds time scales on the order @xmath83 yrs .",

    "these two constraints can be satisfied taking into account two additional sources of libeb @xcite : @xmath87 the neutrino spallation in the he and c shells of sn , which synthesizes @xmath91li and @xmath88b and @xmath90 the break - up of low energy nuclei injected in molecular clouds which produces all libeb isotopes .",

    "our initial motivation to study ccrs at high redshift was to find a physical origin for the anomalously high abundance of liobserved in metal poor halo stars . a cosmic history for structure formation that reproduces standard observations @xcite provides enough energy in sn to produce a li  plateau at the level of @xmath137\\approx -11.2 $ ] via @xmath138 interactions of ccrs with the igm .",
    "note that the li  produced by outflows ( via neutrino spallation and lec ) is negligible .    in this paper",
    ", we considered two models of star formation histories differing by their pop  iii stars . the massive component of model  1 ( @xmath139 ) injects a lot of energy in ccrs so that the necessary fraction @xmath26 is low ( @xmath140 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the stars associated with the massive component of model  2b ( @xmath141 ) are assumed to collapse into black holes without injecting , a priori , any energy in ccrs .",
    "consequently , the fraction @xmath26 associated with sn in the normal mode must be higher ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "this figure would be reduced if super massive stars produce crs .",
    "we confirm , as in rvoii , that the li  primordial abundance always dominates any additional production by ccrs .",
    "the same conclusion holds for deuterium .",
    "similarly , the observed egbr is much larger than the intensity of photons produced by the decay of pions produced by ccr proton collisions .    in the same cosmological context",
    ", we explored the production of other light elements ( beb ) . to that end , it is necessary to track the abundances of metals ( cno ) in the ism and igm .",
    "we have shown that the reverse process ( i.e. cno ccrs on h and he igm gas ) is the dominant channel to synthesize beb .",
    "this is in contrast to the production of beb in the galactic disk , where the reverse process contributes roughly 20% @xcite .",
    "this is easily understood as the metal enrichment in ccrs is inherited from structure abundances , which are far higher than those in the igm .",
    "note that we also checked that the neutrino spallation and lec processes are negligible in the igm beb budget at the time of the galactic formation , i.e. @xmath0 . in all models",
    "considered , we have shown that beb synthesized at @xmath0 is at the level of the observed abundances in the lowest metallicity stars .",
    "this is the first theoretical indication of a _ plateau _ for these elements which does not resort to exotic models of bbn .",
    "note that these results have been obtained with several assumptions about the ccr spectra . to some extent , our modeling ,",
    "be it for light elements ( phe ) or metals ( cno ) , is limited .",
    "indeed , two fundamental ingredients for the calculation are i ) the low energy form of the source spectra for protons and ii ) the propagated fluxes to plug in the igm .",
    "the first item is crucial for determining the acceleration efficiency @xmath26 .",
    "for example , changing @xmath143 to @xmath144hence taking a more conventional spectral index for the sources  would lead to an unphysical value of @xmath145 .",
    "however , we expect that propagation effects on scales of order the warm - hot igm would lead to a steeper spectrum ( i.e. @xmath146 for p s and @xmath12 s ) and a flatting of the cno spectrum of the form we have assumed here .",
    "the second item involves several issues that are intimately connected : the details of cr escape and confinement between the structures , the warm - hot igm and cooler igm is related to whether or not the propagated spectrum displays a spectral index close to the standard source index ( @xmath144 ) or closer to a diffused spectrum ( @xmath143 ) and , more importantly , how this evolves with @xmath21 . without some degree of confinement on the scale of the warm - hot igm , we would be forced to take the same spectrum for p , he and cno nuclei  as would be more natural for a 100% escape to the igm , and this would lead to an overproduction of @xmath2be .",
    "our simple estimate of the spallation timescale within structures indicates that confinement is indeed playing a role and changes to the cr source spectrum will occur .",
    "all of these elements clearly call for a more coherent and refined calculation",
    ". as just outlined , one issue concerns the description of cr propagation in realistic structures , evolving with redshift , which also allows for differentiated production in situ and outside structures .",
    "another important issue is the possibility for heterogeneity in metallicities at a given time ( e.g. @xcite ) , that can not be handled in the homogeneous paradigm developed in @xcite .",
    "this question could be addressed when li  and @xmath2be are observed simultaneously .",
    "finally , we note that b can be observed directly in high redshift objects , as achieved for a damped ly@xmath12 system at @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "observations at even higher @xmath21 may be possible through absorption lines in gamma - rays bursts ( j. prochaska , private communication ) , which should provide very valuable constraints on early libeb production scenarios .",

    "the calculation for d , be and b production follows closely that of the li , as given , for example , in rvoi . in this appendix , we estimate the relative efficiency of various channels as well as the relative efficiency of the d , be and b production with respect to the li  production . in some cases",
