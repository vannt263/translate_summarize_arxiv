    "rotating spiral waves ( rsws ) are typical robust self - organized structures ( autowaves ) in various dissipative systems , ranging from chemistry , biology and ecology @xcite to nonlinear optics and lasers @xcite .",
    "evolution of these spatio - temporal structures is now a subject of extensive theoretical studies , experimental investigations and computer modeling ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many mathematical models in this field are based on concept of excitability @xcite .",
    "an important approach in modern computer investigations of excitable systems is based on using of discrete parallel models with local interactions , mostly by cellular automata ( ca ) .    in the framework of the ca approach @xcite , the three - level representation of the excitable media states is an effective tool for carrying computer experiments with multi - particle systems possessing long - time nonstationary dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "parallelization of updating of the active medium states and locality of interactions between elementary parts of the medium are the fundamental principles of the ca approach . using of this approach admits to fulfill modeling of large systems by emulation of parallel matrix transformations .",
    "the essence of three - level representation of excitable medium @xcite is as follows .",
    "each elementary part or active center ( ac ) of an excitable system has the single stable _ ground _ state , say @xmath0 , and at least two metastable ( upper ) states , say @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the higher metastable state @xmath2 is the _ excited _ one , it may be reached only after certain hard perturbation ( from neighboring acs or from external source ) of the ground state @xmath0 of the considered ac . a group of excited acs may excite another acs etc . due to metastabilty ,",
    "the lifetime @xmath3 of the excited state @xmath2 is a finite value , after which every excited ac spontaneously reaches the intermediate _ refractory _ state @xmath1 .",
    "refractority means `` sleeping '' state at which no excitation of the considered ac is possible both from neighboring acs or from an external source .",
    "moreover , the ac in refractory state ca nt participate in excitation of another acs ( lying at @xmath0 ) .",
    "so , after a refractority lifetime @xmath4 , the considered ac reaches the ground state @xmath0 .",
    "usually only the cyclic transitions ( @xmath5 ) are permitted .",
    "the concept of excitability was developed in biology , but it is widely used now in chemistry and physics . in particular , this concept have been applied to solve many problems arising in modern nonlinear optics , laser physics etc .",
    "@xcite    in @xcite we have considered even more close laser - like analog of excitable system , namely the three - level active medium of the microwave phonon laser ( phaser ) with dipole - dipole interactions between ac . the only significant difference of phaser medium from the usual excitable one is the second channel of diffusion of excitations .",
    "this system was experimentally studied in institute of radio - physics and electronics ( kharkov , ukraine ) @xcite , demonstrating self - organization , bottlenecked cooperative transient processes and other nonlinear phenomena under extremely low level of intrinsic quantum noise ( phaser has 15 orders lower intensity of spontaneous emission in comparison to usual optical - range lasers ) .    in preceding publications @xcite we carried out a series of computer experiments on rsws dynamics in autonomous excitable systems with various control parameters and random initial excitations .",
    "the most interesting phenomena of self - organized vorticity observed in computer experiments @xcite were as follows : ( a )  spatio - temporal transient chaos in form of highly bottlenecked collective evolution of excitations by rsws with variable topological charges ; ( b )  competition of left - handed and right - handed rsws with unexpected features , including self - induced alteration of integral effective topological charge ; ( c )  transient chimera states , i.  e. coexistence of regular and chaotic domains in excitable media ; ( d )  branching of an excitable medium states with different symmetry which may lead to full restoring of symmetry of imperfect starting pattern .",
    "phenomena ( a ) and ( c ) are directly related to microwave phonon laser dynamics features observed earlier in real experiments at liquid helium temperatures on corundum crystals doped by iron - group ions @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report some qualitatively new features of coexistence , competition and collapse of rsws in three - level model @xcite of excitable media under conditions of strong influence of the second channel of diffusion of excitations .",
    "part of these features are caused by unusual mechanism of rsws evolution when rsw s cores get into the surface layer of an active medium ( i.  e. the layer of acs resided at the absorbing boundary ) . instead of well known scenario of rsw collapse , which takes place after collision of rsw s core with absorbing boundary , we observed complicated transformations of the core leading to `` reflection '' of the rsw from the boundary or even to birth of several new rsws in the surface layer . to our knowledge , such nonlinear `` reflections '' of rsws and resulting",
    "die hard vorticity in excitable media with absorbing boundaries were unknown earlier .",
    "the zykov - mikhailov ( zm ) model @xcite is a discrete parallel mapping with local interactions , which may be defined as three - level ca @xcite .",
    "let an active discretized medium @xmath6 has the form of rectangular @xmath7-lattice .",
    "each cell of the lattice contains the single three - level ac with coordinates @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "all the acs in the @xmath6 are identical , and they interact by the same set of rules ( zm model , as well as most of the ca models , is homogeneous and isotropic in the von  neumann sense @xcite ) .",
    "each ac has the single stable _ ground _ state @xmath0 , and two metastable states @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    the upgrade of states @xmath11 of all acs ( i.  e. their intralevel or interlevel transitions ) are carrying out synchronously at each step @xmath12 during the system evolution .",
    "all intralevel ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and some of interlevel ( namely @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) transitions are permitted .",
    "the final step @xmath19 may be either predefined or it will be searched during ca evolution as time ( i.e. quantity of discrete steps ) for reaching an attractor of this ca .",
    "the conditions of upgrade @xcite depend both on @xmath20 and on @xmath21 , where @xmath22 belongs to certain active neigborhood of ac at site @xmath8 . in the framework of the zm model ( and in most of other ca models of excitable chemical systems ) , diffusion of excitations is possible only by @xmath16 transition .",
    "this is a single - channel ( 1c ) mechanism of diffusion .",
    "a modification of zm model was proposed by us @xcite to adapt it for emulation of some aspects of dynamics of class - b optical lasers @xcite and microwave phonon lasers @xcite .",
    "the relaxational properties of acs in microwave phonon lasers are of the same type , as in class - b optical lasers @xcite , and there are experimental confirmations @xcite of common properties of microwave phonon lasers and class - b optical lasers .    in order to formulate boundary conditions for a @xmath6 of finite size ( i.  e. when @xmath23 ) , a set @xmath24 of virtual cells with coordinates @xmath25 may be introduced @xcite .",
    "each virtual cell contains the unexcitable center having the single level @xmath26 .",
    "the surface layer of a bounded active system is represented by the set @xmath27 of acs with coordinates @xmath28 .",
    "note that our surface layer is of 1d type because active medium itself is of 2d type ( we stress this circumstance to avoid misunderstandings ) .",
    "the original zm model has , as it was pointed out earlier , the single channel of diffusion @xcite .",
    "such 1c - diffusion models are adequate for chemical reaction - diffusion systems @xcite . in microwave phonon",
    "laser active system , the multichannel diffusion of spin excitations is the typical case , because it proceeds via ( near)-resonant dipole - dipole ( @xmath29 ) magnetic interactions between paramagnetic ions @xcite . for a three - level system , which is the simplest microwave phonon laser system , there are 3 possible channels of resonant diffusion . in the case",
    "when @xmath29 interactions are forbidden at one of three resonant frequencies of a three - level system , the asymmetric two - channel ( 2c ) diffusion is realized under conditions of perfect refractority of the intermediate level  see @xcite .",
    "note that asymmetric diffusion is well known in biology ( see , e.g. , the book of d.  a.  frank - kamenetzky @xcite ) .",
    "recently a kind of asymmetric diffusion was proposed by n.  packard and r.  shaw @xcite for a mechanical system .",
    "let @xmath6 is a rectangular 2d lattice containing @xmath30 three - level acs .",
    "the upgrade of state @xmath31 of each ac is carried out synchronously during the system evolution .",
    "the excited ( upper ) level @xmath2 has the time of relaxation @xmath32 , and the refractory ( intermediate ) level @xmath1 has the time of relaxation @xmath33 . both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are integer numbers .",
    "this model of excitable system is a kind of three - level ca .",
    "the original zm model @xcite was formulated as three - level ca with 1c diffusion .    in our three - level model of excitable system ( tlm ) , the second channel of diffusion of excitations is included . a detailed argumentation for using of the 2c diffusion mechanism one can find in @xcite .    in the tlm ,",
    "the first channel of diffusion accelerates the transitions @xmath16 for a given ac , and the second channel of diffusion ( which is absent in the zm model ) accelerates the transitions @xmath34 .",
    "the complete description of ac s states @xmath31 in such the tlm model includes one type of global attributes ( the phase counters @xmath35 ) and two types of partial attributes @xmath36 and @xmath37 for each individual ac in @xmath6 .",
    "full description of all ac s possible states is as follows : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40    in the framework of the tlm model , the phase counters lie in the interval @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "the following correspondences between @xmath35 and @xmath42 take place ( by definition ) for all the acs in @xmath6 at all steps @xmath43 of evolution : @xmath44    these correspondences are of key significance for all multistep - relaxation models ( reshodko model @xcite , zm model @xcite etc . )",
    ": there are only three discrete levels , and relaxation of each ac is considered as intralevel transitions ( or transitions between virtual sublevels ) .",
    "the evolution of each individual ac proceeds by sequential cyclic transitions @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , induced by the kolmogorov evolution operator @xmath48 @xcite . in the tlm model , the evolution operator @xmath48 has three orthogonal branches @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , which we call ground , excited and refractory branches respectively . the choice of the branch at iteration @xmath52 is dictated only by the global attribute of the ac at step @xmath43 , namely :    @xmath53      at step @xmath52 , the branch @xmath49 by definition fulfills operations only over those acs , which have @xmath54 at step @xmath43 .",
    "these operations are precisely the same , as in zm model @xcite , namely :    @xmath55    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the accumulating term for the @xmath58-agent , which is an analog of chemical activator @xcite ; @xmath59 is the first - channel diffusion term ; @xmath60 is the threshold for the @xmath58-agent ( @xmath61 ) ; @xmath62 is the accumulation factor for the @xmath58-agent ( @xmath63)$ ] ; @xmath64 is the active neighborhood of the ac at site @xmath8 ; and the @xmath58-agent arrives to acs with @xmath65 only from acs with @xmath66 in @xmath64 : @xmath67    the definition of the diffusion term @xmath59 in eqn .",

    "pattern evolution is very sensitive to geometry of active medium and boundary conditions even in the framework of operation of the same ca .",
    "there are three types of geometry and boundary condition ( gbc ) combinations most commonly used in computer experiments with ca ( see table  i ) .",
    "let us consider them in details .",
    "@xmath99 the gbc-1 type is defined as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 @xmath102 here @xmath103 , and the coordinates @xmath104 belong to the border set @xmath105 of excitable area , i.  e. @xmath106 ) if @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath99 the gbc-2 type can be easily defined by using an extended interval for the phase counter @xmath108 .",
    "let every cell @xmath109 in @xmath24 contains one _ unexcitable _ unit .",
    "all these unexcitable units have frozen @xmath110 at all @xmath111 $ ] without reference to states of @xmath104 , and @xmath112 where , @xmath113 or @xmath114 .",
    "these unexcitable units in @xmath24 `` absorb '' excitations at the border of @xmath6 in contrary to the case of gbc-1 , where excitations at the border @xmath6 are reinjected in active medium . in many cases this difference leads to qualitatively different behaviour of the whole tlm . note that by this way one may also define tlm with _",
    "inhomogeneous _ active medium , where some of acs are changed to unexcitable units , i.  e. unexcitable units are placed not only in @xmath24 , but in @xmath6 too .",
    "this may be easily done by introducing an additional orthogonal branch @xmath115 into the evolution operator @xmath48 .",
    "the pointed additional branch is activated at @xmath116 only and is simply the identity operator @xmath117 , i.e. : @xmath118 . and",
    "even more complex behaviour of such `` impurity '' units may be defined using analogous approach ( i.  e. by introducing additional orthogonal branches in an evolution operator ) : there may be pacemakers @xcite or another special units embedded in active medium and described by phase counter @xmath119 in extended areas @xmath120 or @xmath121 .",
    "@xmath99 the gbc-3 type is , strictly speaking , a case of borderless system .",
    "but the starting pattern has , of course , bounded quantity of acs with @xmath122 , located in bounded part of active medium .",
    "hence , during the whole evolution ( @xmath123 ) the front of growing excited area will meet the unexcited ( but excitable ! ) acs only .",
    "for the case gbc-3 , there is neither absorption of excitations at boundaries ( as for gbc-2 ) , nor feedback by reinjection of excitations in the active system ( as for gbc-1 ) . from this point of view ca of gbc-3 type",
    "are `` simpler '' , than ca of gbc-1 and gbc-2 types .",
    "on the other hand , ca of gbc-3 type are potentially infinite discrete systems where true aperiodic ( irregular , chaotic ) motions are possible , in contrast to finite discrete systems , possessing , of course , only periodic trajectories in certain phase space after ending of transient stage @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there is also very important difference between gbc-2 and other two types of gbc .",
    "the system of gbc-2 type is the single from the three ones under consideration which interacts with the external world dynamically ( besides of relaxation ) .",
    "sure enough , gbc-1 and gbc-3 are connected to this outer world _ only _ by relaxation channels ( the @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the measures of this connection ) . in contrary , a system of the gbc-2 type interacts with surroundings through the real boundary , which is in fact absent in toroidal finite - size active medium of gbc-1 type and it is absent by definition for a system of gbc-3 type . despite of elementary mode of such interaction ( boundary simply",
    " absorbs  the outside - directed flow of excitations from @xmath104 , a system of the gbc-2 type may demonstrate very special behaviour .",
    "the main attention in this work is devoted just to tlm of gbc-2 type as the most realistic model of microwave phonon laser active system , where both the mechanisms of interaction ( dynamical and relaxational ) of an active medium with the outer world are essential .",
    "dissipation in a microwave phonon laser active medium ( highly perfect single crystal at liquid helium temperatures ) is caused by two main mechanisms : ( a ) dynamical , by coherent microwave phonon and photon emission directly through crystal boundaries and ( b ) relaxational , by thermal phonon emission .",
    "there are , of course , many more or less important differences between the tlm model and the real microwave phonon laser systems @xcite , but in any case autonomous microwave phonon laser has only these two mechanisms of interaction with the outer world .",
    ".geometry of active media and boundary conditions [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ ta:01 ]      patterns in zm are described in terms of levels ( or `` colors '' ) of acs , and initial conditions are formulated simply as matrix of acs levels @xmath42 . but",
    "states of acs in such the automata as zm or tlm are fully defined not only by levels @xmath42 itself .",
    "there are global attributes which must be predefined before tlm evolution is started .",
    "some of partial attributes must be predefined too .",
    "these points are essential for reproducing of the results of computer experiments with zm , tlm , etc .    in our work such the initial conditions for the global attributes @xmath124 are used : @xmath125 initial conditions for @xmath126 must be defined for ground - state ac s ( @xmath127 ) only .",
    "in this work , we suppose @xmath128 where @xmath129 means `` if and only if '' . initial conditions for @xmath130 are undefined for all @xmath131",

    "( [ eq:02 ] ) . as the result",
    ", initial conditions will be defined in our tlm model as the matrix @xmath133 ( where @xmath134 ) with additional condition given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:23 ] ) .",
    "a bounded solitary domain of excited acs having appropriate relaxation times and placed far from grid boundaries ( or at unbounded grid ) may evolve to rsws if and only if there is an adjoined ( but not a surrounding ) domain of refractory acs @xcite . in this case",
    "rsws apear by pair with opposite @xmath135 and integral topological charge @xmath136 is obviously conserved ( by infinity in time if grid is unbounded ) .",
    "if such solitary excited - refractory area is placed in a starting pattern near the grid boundary and the gbc-2 conditions take place , the single rsw appears and evolves and @xmath137 is , of course , not conserved in this case .",
    "these simplest and well known examples illustrate possibilities of coexistence and competition of one or two rsws in excitable media , and possible scenarios of the rsw(s ) evolution may be easily forecasted .",
    "an evolution of complex patterns with multiple , irregularly appearing , chaotically - like drifting and colliding rsws ( or , possibly , another spatio - temporal structures ) is in essence unpredictable without direct computing of the whole transient stage .",
    "so , the best way to investigate cellular automaton ( tlm in particular ) is to run it , because , as s.  wolfram pointed out , \" their own evolution is effectively the most efficient procedure for determining their future  ( see @xcite , page 737 ) .",

    "its core splits into rsws with @xmath152 , and at this stage the active medium is filling by such the rsws ( figure  1 , @xmath153 ) .",
    "the next , relatively long stage of evolution is characterized by restless moving and strong competition of rsws .",
    "as the matter of fact , this stage is of the `` winner takes all '' ( wta ) type .",

    "but the core of the winner is not far from the active medium boundary .",
    "drift of this rsw leads to collision of its core with boundary , and the core is absorbed by the latter ( figure  1 , @xmath156 ) .",

    "configuration of the system is precisely repeated ( compare @xmath168 and @xmath171 at figure  2 ) .",
    "in other words , this is spatio - temporal limit cycle .    fully synchronized cyclic transitions for all acs ( @xmath172 ) for this system ( figure",
    "2 ) is in contrast to collapse of excitations for the previous system ( figure  1 ) despite of obvious transient ordering of the spatio - temporal dynamics in the course of events for both the cases ( figure  1 and figure  2 ) .",
    "note that in _ both _ these cases we deal with spontaneous decreasing of effective freedom degrees quantity during the evolution of the system @xcite .",
    "transient ordering of this kind , leading to collapse of excitations ( figure  1 ) , may be interpreted as self - organized degradation ( self - destruction ) of the system .",
    "final state of such the system , of course , is not self - organized , but it is still highly ordered .",
    "this kind of static order is known as freezing , because all acs of the system occupies their ground levels ( like usual particles of a physical system at absolute zero temperature ) .",
    "in contrast , transient ordering , leading to dynamical stabilization of more or less complex spatio - temporal structures ( figure  2 ) , may be interpreted as `` normal '' self - organization in autonomous dissipative system @xcite when most degrees of freedom are `` slaved '' by the small rest of ones . at this self - organized state ,",
    "the system reaches the end of its evolution .",
    "but the system remains unfrozen , it is still far from equilibrium and possesses obvious order in the form of spatio - temporal limit cycle ( figure  2 ) .",
    "all parts of this system ( namely rsws ) are well defined and robust ( as individual dynamical spatio - temporal autostructures ) . at the same time , all these parts and entirely synchronized at global level ( as dynamical components of the whole system demonstrating collective rhythmic motions ) .",
    "nevertheless , both these scenarios of dissipative system evolution ( self - destruction at figure  1 and normal self - organization at figure  2 ) exhibit more or less fluent transition from initial spatial chaos to static ( figure  1 ) or dynamically stable ( figure  2 ) order .",
    "a different scenario is exemplified in the next subsection .      in this subsection",
    ", we will describe another way to reach periodic state in a bounded discrete 2d-3l-2c excitable system .",
    "formally , the final state for this new case is spatio - temporal limit cycle too ( as in the case of figure  2 ) .",
    "but the time of transient process is much longer here , and the longest part of the transient proceeds in the form of lethargic competition between various spatio - temporal structures .",
    "as it was already shown in the preceding subsection ( figure  2 ) , spatio - temporal structures may actively interact not only between themselves , but they interact in a nontrivial manner with boundaries of the excitable medium too .",
    "the simplest case when drift of rsws leads to collisions of their cores with boundary , and the cores are absorbed by the latter ( figure  1 , @xmath157 ) , is not typical case for the system studied in this subsection . on the contrary ,",
    "rsws in such the system under appropriate conditions may be `` reflected '' from boundaries in a strongly nonlinear manner .",
    "moreover , due to nonlinear processes in the surface layer , the quantity of `` reflected '' rsws may exceed the quantity of primary rsws ( phenomenon of multiplication of rsws ) . a detailed description of nonlinear `` reflections '' of rsws and some accompanied phenomena will be published in separate paper .    here",
    "we describe a particular , but important case of highly bottlenecked transient process , caused mainly by almost everlasting competition of rsws and labyrinths . at figure  3 ,",
    "a fragment of evolution is shown at @xmath173 for the 2d-3l-2c system , which differs from the previous system ( figure  2 ) only by two parameters : @xmath174 ; @xmath175 for figure  3 ( instead of @xmath176 ; @xmath177 for figure  2 ) .",
    "starting pattern for the system at figure  3 is precisely the same as at figure  2 ( so it is not shown at figure  3 ) .",
    "previous two systems ( figures  1 and 2 ) reach their attractors already at @xmath178 .",
    "the system under consideration ( figure  3 ) has very long transient time , because of lethargic competition between rsws and labyrinthic structures under conditions of regeneration ( nonlinear `` reflections '' ) and multiplication of rsws at boundaries .",
    "there are many fine phenomena accompanied these competition .",
    "e.  g. , the largest rsw with @xmath179 resided in bottom left corner of the active medium ( figure  3 , @xmath180 ) moves in the _ north _ direction to the big labyrinth .",
    "finally , the latter absorbs the core of the pointed rsw ( figure  3 , @xmath181 ) . at the same time",
    "new small rsws are generated in the bulk active medium and regenerated ( by nonlinear `` reflections '' ) in the surface layer .",
    "the dominant drift directions of rsws in the system under consideration lie at _",
    "north_@xmath182_south _ and _ east_@xmath182_west _ lines ( this circumstance is evident when one see a movie of the system evolution )",
    ". drift of labyrinths is more complicated . in the fragment shown at figure  3",
    ", the big labyrinth is slowly moving approximately in _ north - east _ direction .",
    "a new labyrinth is formed simultaneously .",
    "this new labyrinth pushes rsws ( figure  3 , @xmath181 ) etc .",
    "the fragment of evolution shown at figure  3 demonstrate only small part of transient phenomena observed during this system evolution .",
    "we will mention now such the typical stages of the system evolution ( _ not shown _ at figure  3 )",
    ":    @xmath99 nonlinear `` reflection '' of large rsw with @xmath183 from boundary accompanied by changing of @xmath184 and simultaneuos birth of several new small rsws ( satellites ) nearby the core of large rsw ( @xmath185 ) .    @xmath99 rotation of giant labyrinth around the domain occupied by rsws ( @xmath186 ) ; erosion of this labyrinth due to rsws activity up to almost full dominance of rsws over active medium ( @xmath187 ) ; revival of labyrinth structures and resumption of competition between rsws and labyrinths ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "@xmath99 nonlinear `` reflection '' of large rsw with @xmath183 from boundary with saving of @xmath184 ( @xmath189 , upper part of active medium ) .",
    "shining examples of multiplication of rsws at boundaries ( the same interval @xmath190 , left , right and bottom boundaries ) .",
    "@xmath99 birth of self - organized pacemaker ( a source of concentric autowaves ) due to nonlinear processes of rsw s core transformations in the surface layer ; evolution and decay of the pacemaker ( @xmath191 , left boundary of the active medium ) .",
    "@xmath99 pushing of labyrinth by a group of rsws ( @xmath192 ) etc .    from the formal point of view , all these stages of the system evolution are only partial transient episodes on the long way to the final self - organized state .",
    "we know that such the state is a regular attractor ( spatio - temporal limit cycle or at least point - like attractor ) because by definition our system is autonomous , it has bounded quantity of discrete elements , each element has bounded quantity of discrete states , and time is discrete too .",
    "but we do not get concrete view of the attractor until we reach it . shortly , `` transient is nothing , attractor is all '' .    from an alternative point of view , each stage of the system evolution is a day in the life of this system , and the final of evolution is of minor interest , because no new events will come to pass if an attractor is already reached .",
    "shortly , from this point of view , `` transient is all , attractor is nothing '' .",
    "but this alternative is not the single one .",
    "another alternative is as follows : `` transient is all _ that we can see _ , because attractor is unachievable '' .",
    "this last alternative ( for a non - ca system with continuous spectrum of states of its elementary components ) was discussed in a seminal work of j.  p.  crutchfield and k.  kaneko @xcite , which was entitled : `` are attractors relevant to turbulence ? '' . in @xcite , this question",
    "was slightly reformulated in the context of our studies of ca systems : `` are attractors relevant to transient spatio - temporal chaos ? '' ( turbulence in bounded , fully discrete system is no more than metaphor ) .",
    "the answer is `` yes '' if an attractor may be reached for a reasonable time @xmath193 ( in fully discrete and bounded system @xmath193 is always limited by quantity of all possible states of the system ) .",
    "but the answer is `` no '' if @xmath193 exceeds any possible duration of an experiment . in this case",
    "a system with transient spatio - temporal chaos can not be distinguished from true chaotic system without additional testing .    as a matter of fact , there are some intermediate classes of phenomena `` at the edge between order and chaos '' which may appear in bounded discrete deterministic system with large phase space .",
    "self - organization scenario which includes super - slow , bottlenecked , chaotic - like stages is a signature of dominance of such an intermediate class of system dynamics in numerical experiments .",
    "really , having limited time and computer capacity , one can not reach final self - organized state for a system with huge dimension of phase space .",
    "such ca ( or another discrete mapping with lethargic evolution ) does not permit direct forecasting of the system future without direct computation .",
    "so the computed part of transient process is the single source of available information of our fully deterministic but partially determined system .",
    "generally , the ideas of interconnection between chaotization , turbulence , unpredictability ( at one side ) and ordering , self - organization , long - time forecasting ( at the opposite side ) may be very fruitful at least for investigation of complex deterministic systems .",
    "in this work , we fulfill computer modeling of spatio - temporal dynamics in large dicrete systems of three - level excitable acs interacting by short - range 2c diffusion .",
    "computer experiments with this 2d-3l-2c system were carried out using the cross - platform software package `` three - level model of excitable system '' ( tlm )  2006  s.  d.  makovetskiy @xcite .",
    "the most typical scenario of evolution is as follows . a robust rsw or more complicated but strictly periodic in time structure is formed being a cyclic attractor at several initial conditions  see figure  2",
    "this is an analog of limit cycle , i. e. regular attractor known in lumped dynamical systems . alternatively ,",
    "collapse of excitations , i.  e. full freezing of the excitable system takes place  see figure  1 .",
    "this is an analog of point - like attractor in lumped dynamical systems .",
    "long - time evolution ( @xmath194 iterations ) of a 2d-3l-2c system with slightly changed parameters demonstrates some unusual phenomena including highly bottlenecked collective relaxation of excitations .",
    "part of these phenomena are caused by mechanism of nonlinear regeneration of rsws in the surface layer of an active medium . instead of well known scenario of rsw collapse , which takes place after collision of rsw s core with absorbing boundary , we observed complicated transformations of the rsws cores leading to nonlinear `` reflections '' of the rsws from the normally absorbing boundaries or even to birth of new rsws in the surface layer .",
    "lethargic transient processes observed in our computer experiments are partially caused by competitions between permanently reviving rsws and labyrinthic spatio - temporal structures .",
    "to our knowledge , phenomena of such the nonlinear `` reflections '' of rsws and resulting die hard vorticity in excitable media with absorbing boundaries were unknown earlier .",
