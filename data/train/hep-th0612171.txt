    "flux compactifications ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews and exhaustive lists of references ) have become of central importance in string theory in recent years .",
    "the reasons for this are manifold , ranging from a desire to make contact with experiments ( in particle physics and cosmology ) to the purely theoretical interest ( to understand new solutions , geometries and topologies for their own sake ) .",
    "the last few years have seen the gathering of a lot of new ` data ' , yet no synthesis , analogous to the second string revolution , is in sight .",
    "in fact , it can be argued that the gathering of mathematical data has just begun , and that this has inspired ( and has been inspired by ) quite a few breakthroughs in mathematics .",
    "recent years have also seen the maturing of topological string theory ( see @xcite for reviews and references ) and the birth of the outline of a theory known as topological m - theory @xcite , which promises to unify the different topological string theories in a unified framework . such theories , playing a side role in their infancy , have come more and more to the mainstream discussions of string theory , with many unexpected contributions to the physical side of string theory .    in @xcite , which is a seminal attempt to bridge topological- and super - string theories , vafa made the conjecture that mirror symmetry ought to be extendable to the scenario that included compactification of string theory on calabi - yau manifolds with fluxes .",
    "this has been verified in the low - energy limit for different cases .",
    "for example in @xcite it was shown that type iia and type iib theories with rr fluxes continue to be mirror symmetric if they are compactified on a pair of mirror calabi - yau manifolds , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . recall that the rr field strengths are even forms in iia and odd forms in iib , and so the extension of mirror symmetry with rr fluxes is consistent , although by no means trivially so , with the intuition of mirror symmetry exchanging odd and even cohomologies in the hodge diamonds of the mirror pair .",
    "since the ns field strength is a three form and is the same in both type ii theories , the results of @xcite raises the obvious question of what is the mirror dual of , say , type iib theory on a calabi - yau @xmath2 with just ns fluxes turned on .",
    "vafa had suggested that the dual of iib on @xmath2 with ns fluxes also has fluxes but now these fluxes are ` even ns fluxes ' that are encoded in the dilaton and the graviton ( which are also in the ns sector ) . in other words",
    ", vafa suggested that the dual ought to be an almost complex manifold whose complex structure would _ not _ be integrable .",
    "this lack of integrability would encode the missing ns fluxes , without recourse to the usual ` matter sector ' , say , as in @xcite .",
    "vafa s intuition was made concrete in the astonishing work @xcite which showed that the relevant geometry dual to that of calabi - yau @xmath2 with ns fluxes , are a special class of _ half - flat _ manifolds which we shall denote by @xmath3 in this paper .",
    "these manifolds are , in a sense , deformations of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath1 which is the canonical mirror dual of @xmath2 . _",
    "generic _ half - flat manifolds , @xmath4 , are a special class of @xmath5 manifolds which are the minimal ingredient for the @xmath6 reduction of ten - dimensional type ii string theory @xcite .",
    "half - flat manifolds had already made their appearance in the work of hitchin @xcite , and they play an important role in the construction of a special type of @xmath0 holonomy manifold .",
    "it is interesting to note that hitchin s work emphasizes the form - aspects of the special geometries in six and seven dimensions , and thus is very close in spirit to topological string / m theories and the related form - theories of gravity .    in this paper",
    "we were motivated by taking a closer look at the metric sector of the half - flat manifolds @xmath3 proposed in @xcite , in particular we wanted to know if the ricci tensor of @xmath3 plays any role in the low energy effective theory . at the time of the onset of this work",
    "there were no formulae for the ricci curvature of half - flat manifolds available in the literature , and we decided to derive expressions for it .",
    "recently , as our work of the ` physics ' part was nearing completion , which is based on the mathematical results that we derived earlier , we learned in @xcite of a paper @xcite in the mathematics archives which computes the ricci curvature of manifolds with @xmath5 structure .",
    "thus the first half of our paper will have some overlap with @xcite in content but not in technique , language or point of view .    _",
    "the central results of our paper are the following : we have derived expressions , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ricci ] ) and ( [ eq : scalar ] ) , for the ricci curvature of generic half - flat manifolds in terms of their intrinsic torsion by thinking of them as hypersurfaces that foliate a non - compact @xmath0 holonomy cylinder _  la _",

    "( [ eq : infcond ] ) or ( [ eq : intcond ] ) , on the khler moduli space .",
    "this leads , by using one of hitchin s flow equations , to a formula ( [ eq : volflow ] ) for the flow of the volume of @xmath3 . _    at the risk of repeating ourselves , we now give a brief overview of the different sections of our paper . in section two",
    "we review properties of six - dimensional manifolds with @xmath5 structure , considering in particular those of calabi - yau and half - flat manifolds .",
    "intrinsic torsion classes of the manifolds , and expression of the exterior derivatives of the fundamental two form @xmath8 and three form @xmath9 in terms of them , are discussed . in section three",
    "we show that the intrinsic torsion of half - flat manifolds is equivalent to their extrinsic curvature when embedded inside seven dimensional manifolds of @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "then in section four , by exploiting the relationship between half - flat manifolds with @xmath5 structure and non - compact manifolds with @xmath0 holonomy , we derive expressions for the ricci curvature tensor and scalar for half - flat manifolds in terms of the torsion classes . in section five",
    "we verify our results of section four by comparing ricci curvature computed using torsion classes to that determined from standard affine connection expressions .",
    "we make our comparisons for a subset of half - flat manifolds known as nilmanifolds ( which are derived from nilpotent lie algebras and include iwasawa manifolds as examples ) .",
    "then in section six we derive expressions for the torsion classes of the _ particular _ half - flat manifolds @xmath3 in the language of the moduli spaces of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath1 , and then derive expressions for the ricci curvature for @xmath3 .",
    "we then turn our attention to a particular term in the low energy effective action ( derived in @xcite ) and study its variation .",
    "we derive two expressions for this variation which from consistency arguments must be the same , and from that we derive a condition on the khler moduli space of the compactification .",
    "we show that this condition reduces to a trivial identity in the limiting case when the ` underlying ' calabi - yau @xmath1 has a one dimensional khler moduli space . in section seven",
    "we conclude the body of our paper with a discussion of our findings and some comments on further work that needs to be done .",

    "a six dimensional orientable manifold @xmath10 is said to have @xmath5 structure if it admits _ only _ one no - where vanishing majorana spinor @xmath11 .",
    "it can be shown that the existence of such a spinor implies that the structure group of the frame bundle of @xmath10 is reduced from @xmath12 to @xmath5 .",
    "this globally defined spinor is the singlet in the decomposition of the @xmath13 of @xmath14 ( which is the spin cover of @xmath12 ) under @xmath5 : @xmath15 another way of defining @xmath5 structure is to say that @xmath10 admits a non - degenerate almost hermitian structure @xmath16 ( which is not necessarily integrable ) and a globally defined 3-form @xmath17 which is of type @xmath18 with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "it can be shown that such objects define a riemannian structure @xmath19 on @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "given the riemannian structure @xmath19 one can construct a @xmath20-type 2-form , which we denote by the same symbol @xmath8 , via @xmath21 the quantities @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be constructed from the globally defined spinor @xmath11 in the following way @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the antisymmetrized products of the @xmath26 gamma matrices and @xmath27 is the six - dimensional chirality operator .",
    "our convention for the gamma matrices is that they are all imaginary ( including @xmath27 ) and hermitian .",
    "conjugate spinors are given by @xmath28 , and the majorana condition is @xmath29 .",
    "also we denote by @xmath30 and @xmath31 the real and the imaginary part of @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we have taken @xmath11 , the globally defined eight - component majorana spinor on @xmath10 , to be commuting .",
    "this construction is of course local and for the manifold to have @xmath5 structure the spinor @xmath11 must remain a singlet under parallel propagation around closed loops via some connection @xmath33 .",
    "i.e. @xmath34 however , this connection @xmath33 may not be the torsion - free unique levi - civita connection , which we denote by @xmath35 , that is constructed from @xmath19 .",
    "if it is , then the integrability condition of eq.([eq : parallel ] ) implies that holonomy group of the levi - civita connection , which we denote by @xmath36 , is @xmath5 , and the corresponding spinor @xmath11 is said to be covariantly constant or just constant .",
    "such manifolds are khler with vanishing first chern class , and the corresponding metric is ricci - flat .",
    "these manifolds are the calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath11 is not constant then the holonomy group of the levi - civita connection will not be @xmath5 . given the levi - civita connection and @xmath37 we can always construct a connection @xmath33 such that ( [ eq : parallel ] ) is satisfied @xcite .",
    "the difference between these two connections is given by the contorsion @xmath38 or equivalently the torsion @xmath39 , which lies in @xmath40 .",
    "( we use the convention that @xmath41 denotes the lie algebra of the lie group @xmath42 ) . however , when structure group is reduced to @xmath5 , the difference between the two connections is encoded in the intrinsic contorsion @xmath43 or the intrinsic torsion @xmath44 , which is actually in @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is defined by the decomposition @xmath47 .",
    "thus we have from eq.([eq : parallel ] ) @xmath48 and intrinsic torsion encodes how @xmath36 deviates from @xmath5 .    since @xmath49 and @xmath50 under @xmath5 , the intrinsic torsion breaks up into various @xmath5 modules , and this provides a useful scheme for the classification of manifolds with @xmath5 structure unless otherwise indicated .",
    "it can be shown that the intrinsic torsion for @xmath10 breaks up into five @xmath5 modules @xcite @xmath51 where these modules are called _",
    "torsion classes _ and denoted by @xmath52 .",
    "thus the class of @xmath5 manifolds known as calabi - yau manifolds may be characterized by @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "it should be clear from the foregoing discussion that in the general case of @xmath5 structure , neither @xmath8 ( the 2-form corresponding to @xmath16 ) nor @xmath32 would be closed .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 , which are in the @xmath57 and @xmath58 representations of @xmath12 , respectively , decompose , under @xmath5 , in the following way @xcite @xmath59 and @xmath60    as explained in the introduction , we are interested in a class of manifolds with @xmath5 structure which arise from considering mirror symmetry on compactifications of string theories on calabi - yau manifolds with ns fluxes .",
    "such manifolds are known as _ half - flat _ manifolds and they are characterized by is defined only up to multiplication by a phase , hence there are two natural options for ( [ eq : conditions1 ] ) .",

    "@xmath32 the requirement of half - flatness ( [ eq : conditions1 ] ) becomes @xcite @xmath65",
    "in this section we demonstrate , by constructing the explicit maps , that the intrinsic torsion of half - flat manifolds is equivalent to the extrinsic curvature of the embedding of such manifolds inside a manifold with @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "let @xmath66 be a seven - dimensional riemannian manifold with @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "this means that @xmath66 comes equipped with a 3-form @xmath67 and a 4-form @xmath68 , both of which are globally defined , and invariant under a @xmath0 transformation of the tangent bundle ; and that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are closed .",
    "then , they induce a riemannian structure @xmath69 on @xmath66 such that @xmath70 where the hodge star operator @xmath71 is defined with respect to @xmath69",

    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are called the associative and co - associative @xmath0-forms , respectively , and these labels derive from the fact that the components of @xmath67 are the structure constants of the automorphism group of the imaginary octonians .    another way of saying that @xmath66 has @xmath0 holonomy is to say that there is only one covariantly constant majorana spinor @xmath11 , @xmath74 on @xmath66 .",
    "then this spinor can be used to define the associative and the co - associative forms via @xmath75    a seven dimensional manifold with @xmath0 holonomy defines locally an @xmath5 structure on a six dimensional sub - manifold . as mentioned in the introduction",
    "we want to exploit the relationship between half - flat manifolds @xmath4 with @xmath5 structure and non - compact @xmath0 holonomy manifolds @xmath66 .",

    "note that on a general six dimensional manifold with @xmath5 structure the intrinsic torsion has 42 independent components which the half - flatness condition reduces by half .",
    "also , note that , for a general seven dimensional metric of the form ( [ eq : g2metric ] ) the second fundamental form has exactly 21 independent components . as is obvious from ( [ eq : g2killing ] ) then , there is a one - to - one map between the intrinsic torsion of a half - flat manifold and the second fundamental form of its embedding into a @xmath0 holonomy manifold .",

    "before we present our results regarding @xmath3 , we shall review some of the results and methods of gurrieri et al .",
    "our aim is not to try to be exhaustive and the interested reader may look up @xcite for more details .    for definiteness ,",
    "consider type iib on @xmath2 with non - zero ns fluxes .",
    "these fluxes are characterized by a set of integers @xmath143 which on the type iib side are given by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the ten - dimensional ns 3-form field strength and @xmath146 is the four - dimensional ns 2-form potential , and @xmath147 with @xmath148 , are half of the standard real symplectic basis of the third cohomology group @xmath149 of @xmath2 .",
    "( this , incidentally , is the meaning of ` electric fluxes ' ; the coefficients of @xmath150 , the other half of the symplectic basis , would be the magnetic fluxes , but they are set to zero in @xcite .",

    "we shall soon see the motivation for doing so , as they play quite different roles on the mirror manifold .    turning on fluxes on a calabi - yau background still preserves @xmath6 supersymmetry of the low energy effective theory but now , instead of being a supergravity theory coupled to hyper- , tensor- and vector - multiplets , the theory becomes massive ( i.e. , a potential is induced ) , and some of the peccei - quinn symmetries become gauged . because @xmath6 supersymmetry of @xmath7 depends solely on the structure group of the internal manifold being @xmath5 , this singles out for the mirror candidate only those manifolds which have @xmath5 as their structure group .",
    "calabi - yau manifolds are of course a very special subset of this class for which the holonomy group of the levi - civita connection is also @xmath5 .    in string theory on calabi - yau manifolds",
    "the khler form @xmath8 naturally combines with the internal components of the ns gauge potential @xmath157 to form a complex closed two form @xmath158 .",
    "the moduli space relevant for string theory is the complexified khler cone and it is the parameter space of the deformation of this complexified two - form .",
    "however , when one turns - on ns fluxes , the real part of this two form is no longer closed . as mentioned above , the mirror manifold , because of @xmath6 supersymmetry , must be an @xmath5 manifold and hence must have globally defined @xmath32 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , @xmath32 and @xmath8 no longer have the interpretation of being the holomorphic three form that defines a calabi - yau uniquely , and the khler form , respectively ; but now they are components of @xmath5 structure . in the familiar calabi - yau",
    "setting , mirror symmetry may be seen as exchanging these two @xmath5 structure forms between the two mirror - symmetric pair .",
    "thus it seems natural to assume that in the more generalized case at hand mirror symmetry continues to do the same .",
    "then on the presumed mirror of @xmath2 with fluxes , the real part of @xmath32 can no longer be closed but this is not central to our discussion at the moment . ] as its mirror counterpart @xmath157 is no longer closed .",
    "thus we see the mirror can no longer be a calabi - yau manifold .",
    "let us denote this manifold by @xmath3 as we expect it to have some connection to the calabi - yau @xmath1 which is the canonical mirror dual of @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath5 structure is classified by the torsion classes that appear in @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the authors of @xcite then proceeded to identify the various non - zero torsion classes of @xmath3 with the @xmath5 representations of the various cohomology groups of @xmath1 .",
    "the rationale for this is as follows .",
    "the various cohomology groups of a calabi - yau manifold furnish different representations of @xmath5 . on the other hand , in the small flux limit @xmath3 should , at least locally , look like @xmath1 and so all the forms which exist on the latter should also exist on the former furnishing the same representations of @xmath5 .",
    "so it is sensible to identify these @xmath5 representations with corresponding torsion classes which appear in the exterior derivatives of @xmath8 and @xmath32 on @xmath3 .",
    "this heuristic argument was made more precise in @xcite in various steps and it was shown that the surviving torsion classes lead to @xmath3 being a half - flat manifold .",
    "also it was shown that the standard basis of the cohomology groups of @xmath1 should satisfy on @xmath3 the following relations : @xmath159 as a consequence , due to the standard definition of @xmath8 and @xmath32 ( see appendix [ ap : cymod ] for more details ) , we also have : @xmath160 in the above equations we have @xmath161 and @xmath162 , with @xmath163 and @xmath164 , are the standard symplectic basis of the third cohomology group of the calabi - yau manifold @xmath1 . similarly @xmath165 and @xmath166 are the basis for @xmath167 and @xmath168 respectively .",
    "@xmath169 are half of the coordinates on the khler moduli space of @xmath1 and is defined by @xmath170 .",
    "note that in the above expressions @xmath153 is absent ; it appears , after dualizing , as the space - time components of the ns field strength on type iia theory and thus acts as a sort of ` cosmological constant ' in @xmath7 .",
    "since we expect the kinetic terms in @xmath7 to remain the same , it was further assumed in @xcite that the above - mentioned forms should continue to satisfy the same integral relations on @xmath3 as they do on @xmath1 . in other words",
    "we still have @xmath171 @xmath172 and @xmath173 however , since these forms are no longer harmonic due to ( [ eq : rules ] ) , they do not have the same topological significance for @xmath3 as they did for @xmath1 .",
    "indeed it was noted in @xcite that the dimensions of the second and the third cohomology group of @xmath3 changes with respect to those of @xmath1 , but in a way that the euler characteristics of the two manifolds are the same .",
    "note that the expressions in ( [ eq : rules ] )  ( [ eq : dom2 ] ) are given in a fixed special geometric gauge .",
    "the above rules for taking exterior derivatives and performing integrals on @xmath3 , are only valid in the large volume limit ( i.e.  the supergravity limit ) _ and _ the large complex structure limit .",
    "the latter condition comes from the fact that on the iib side one is in the large volume limit , since the gravitational back - reaction on the geometry due to the fluxes is ignored , and hence on the iia side , by mirror symmetry , one must be in the large complex structure limit . using the above rules the authors of @xcite then derived the effective action of type iia on @xmath3 and showed that it is the same as the effective action of iib compactified on the calabi - yau @xmath2 with ns fluxes .    note that the dimensional reduction in @xcite could have been carried out , in principle , using a harmonic basis on @xmath3 but it is not clear that that basis represents the physically meaningful degrees of freedom .",
    "thus from a physical point of view it is more convenient to continue using the language of calabi - yau compactifications and interpret the extra terms that arise from the non - closure of the forms as being terms for the effective potential generated for the moduli as a result of fluxing .",
    "this is also the natural language in which to make connection with gauged supergravity .",
    "thus we continue to call the scalar fields , familiar from cy compactification , ` moduli ' but now they come with a non - vanishing potential , which fixes them partially .",
    "let us now deal with the issue of ` large complex structure ' alluded to before .",
    "what is the meaning of the large complex structure limit for a manifold which is not complex ? recall that at a generic point on the complex structure moduli space of a calabi - yau , the pre - potential is a complicated , homogeneous holomorphic function of degree two .",
    "but in the large complex structure limit this function becomes a simple polynomial .",
    "thus , we interpret the above statement by assuming that the prepotential of the complex structure moduli space takes this latter simple form : @xmath174 where @xmath175 are projective coordinates and following @xcite we set @xmath176 in what follows .",
    "we now derive expressions for the torsion classes from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dj2 ] ) and ( [ eq : dom2 ] ) in the language of the moduli space of calabi - yau manifolds @xcite . to do",
    "so we recall the expression for @xmath152 in the large complex structure limit ( see appendix [ ap : cmplxlarge ] for more details ) : @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the imaginary part of the complex structure modulus @xmath179 , and @xmath180 and @xmath181 span @xmath182 and @xmath183 of @xmath1 , respectively . using the above identification it is easy to show that @xmath184 where we have introduced the notation @xmath185 now that we have identified the individual torsion classes we can use eq.([eq : ricci ] ) to find expressions for the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar of @xmath3 .",

    "next , we shall use a consistency argument involving eq .",
    "( [ eq : intricci ] ) to establish whether we can derive any new condition on @xmath3 that is not part of the rules , ( [ eq : rules ] ) , proposes in @xcite . to do this",
    "we shall consider the variation of ( [ eq : intricci ] ) .",
    "the left hand side of this variation will involve the explicit expressions , ( [ eq : mixed ] ) and ( [ eq : pure ] ) , for the ricci tensor and we can evaluate these integrals using properties of cy moduli spaces , as was done in deriving the effective action in @xcite . on the other hand the variation of the right hand side of",
    "( [ eq : intricci ] ) may also be evaluated by using the standard results of cy moduli spaces .",

    "but for the case at hand , we only have indirect information about the geometric quantities on @xmath3 and it may be that the rules ( [ eq : rules ] ) are not exhaustive to ensure that such identities are automatically satisfied . thus such consistency arguments are valuable since they furnish us with further information regarding these manifolds . indeed ,",
    "below we find a new constraint on the khler moduli space in this way .",

    "for the sake of greater readability , details of the derivations of many of the formulae used in the following pages are relegated to appendix [ ap : details ] .",
    "returning to the variation of ( [ eq : intricci ] ) we get @xmath190 where the term with @xmath191 drops out because it is a total derivative .",

    "our choice here is motivated by two facts .",
    "first , the right hand side of ( [ eq : varricci ] ) is entirely in terms of variation of khler moduli , and hence the terms on the left hand side that involve variation of the complex structure moduli must be transformed to the appropriate variation of the khler moduli .",
    "for the conventions that we are using ( @xmath176 and @xmath196 ) it can be shown that the prefactor above has to be @xmath197 .",
    "secondly , the condition that we get below ( eq.([eq : infcond ] ) ) from ( [ eq : varricci ] ) this way , we apply to the case where the underlying calabi - yau @xmath1 has @xmath198 ( e.g. , the famous quintic has this property ) and in this case , as shall be shown below , the dependence of ( [ eq : varricci ] ) on the flux parameters @xmath142 drops out .",
    "the resulting equation in this limiting case must be an identity on the moduli space of the calabi - yau @xmath1 with @xmath198 .",

    "these formulae do nt seem to be in contradiction with the new modifications suggested by ( [ eq : rules ] ) and ( [ eq : intcond ] ) .",
    "however , these formulae ( of which strominger s or kodaira s formulae are just two ) have deep geometric and topological significance for calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "thus it seems to us that it is important to find how these formulae should be interpreted for the half - flat manifold @xmath3 .",
    "an important step in this direction was taken by a recent paper @xcite in which the authors try to make explicit the minimal set of geometric assumptions that are inherent in deriving @xmath7 from compactification on a manifold with @xmath5 structure .",
    "other more formal developments have been made in @xcite .",
    "very briefly , these works explore a generalized set - up , based on the idea of ` pure spinors ' , that is natural for mirror symmetry with fluxes .",
    "these works parallel the introduction , by hitchin @xcite , of ` generalized calabi - yau ' manifolds in mathematics . on a generalized calabi - yau manifold the almost complex and symplectic structures are considered to be a unitary object .",
    "complex , symplectic and calabi - yau manifolds may be thought of as special cases when the various structures become integrable .",
    "( more details of this construction can be found in @xcite . )    although , we hope to return to some of the issues left open by the present work in the light of some of the approaches mentioned above , we suggest here another approach , which might also lead to deeper insights into the structure of @xmath3 ( as opposed to the more general @xmath5 manifolds ) .",
    "a while ago vafa and shatashvili had initiated a study into the cft of strings on manifolds with @xmath0 ( and other exceptional ) holonomy @xcite .",
    "the half - flat manifolds @xmath3 do not occur as a solution of string theory but rather the natural solution is of the form @xmath233 where @xmath66 is a generalized cylinder with @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "thus to go beyond the various approximations that encumber one s progress , it might be a good idea to revisit some of the results obtained in @xcite for the generalized cylinder @xmath66 and try to rephrase them , with applications to half - flat manifolds in mind .",
    "this is perhaps quite an ambitious project but the gains might be worth the efforts .",
    "one of the aspects of string theory today is that a string vacuum ( in which we also include members of the ` flux vacua ' ) can not be understood in isolation .",
    "an isolated solution of string theory does nt seem to make sense .",
    "it is important to understand these new solutions , not only _ ab initio _ but also _ in relation _ to other ` nearby ' solutions .",
    "it seems to us that an approach solely based on @xmath7 can only go so far , and that a more cft approach is needed to understand this space of solutions .",
    "of course for many of the solutions that are being considered today , the cft approach is not enough since these solutions involve many non - perturbative effects .",
    "we would like to end this paper with a remark on the compactification of @xmath234 heterotic string theory on @xmath3 .",
    "since @xmath3 are closely related to @xmath1 , it is natural to enquire how these new manifolds are related to the famous phenomenology programme of string theory that began in @xcite .",
    "some important steps have already been taken in that direction @xcite but there is much work to be done .",
    "important for possible heterotic applications is that , due to the green - schwarz anomaly , stringy aspects ( i.e. , @xmath235 corrections ) are expected to play an important role @xcite .",
    "so far there has been very little investigation of those aspects of @xmath3 that are relevant beyond the specific supergravity approximation that we also adopted here .",
    "this , again , brings us back to the @xmath0 picture alluded to above ( which is also central to the derivations of the present paper ) .",
    "we believe some of the methods used in this paper can be extended to include some of those stringy aspects .",
    "this question is currently under study by the present authors @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank andrei micu for many helpful discussions and communications regarding section [ sec : defcy ] of this paper .",
    "we would also like to thank him for bringing reference @xcite to our attention .",
