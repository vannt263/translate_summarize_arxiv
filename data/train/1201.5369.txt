    "one may also expect the pm insulating ( pm - i ) phase stabilized in the same region of @xmath7 ; the intermediate regime , @xmath32 ( see , fig .",

    ", one may resort the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) calculations with charge self - consistency @xcite , and compare the total energy for pm , fm and afm configurations as we did in this study within lda@xmath2 scheme .    to understand metal - insulator phase transition as a function of lno thickness @xcite",
    ", we examined ni @xmath4 dos depending on the thickness , @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath12-band width change as a function of @xmath7 may be an useful information as @xmath33 plays an important role in the metal - insulator phase transition of rare - earth nickelate @xcite .",
    "[ pdos_pm_u0 ] shows dos of the pm case with @xmath34 .",
    "even if the bulk lno locates at the vicinity of metal - insulator phase boundary and exhibits the correlated electron behaviors , the electronic structure of pm lno has been reasonably well described within lda ( or gga ) as shown in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "[ pdos_pm_u0](a)-(d ) presents the evolution of @xmath4 dos as a function of @xmath7 .",

    "[ pdos_pm_u0](b ) ) , which was reported to be magnetic and insulating @xcite , the right edge of the @xmath27 state is fairly similar to that of @xmath26 whereas the left - edge is reduced .",
    "it is not certain however that such a relatively small difference in terms of the effective band width is responsible for the metal - insulator phase transition between @xmath23 and 4 as reported in experiment @xcite .",
    "a complementary picture can be provided by lda@xmath2 calculations for the magnetic phase .",

    "this state becomes more and more delocalized as @xmath7 increases as seen in fig .",
    "[ pdos_fm_u5](b)-(d ) . once again",
    ", however , the amount of the effective band width change depending on @xmath7 does not seem to be enough to make metal - insulator phase transition across @xmath7=24 .",

    "= 0 ( pm ) , @xmath1=3 ( fm ) , and @xmath1=5 ( fm ) , respectively .",
    "[ pvsm],width=188 ]    an interesting point observed in fig .",
    "[ pdos_fm_u5 ] is that even in lda@xmath2 calculation , the systems do not become a perfect insulator , but have finite number of states around fermi level @xcite .",
    "it may partly be attributed to the strong covalency between ni-@xmath12 and o-@xmath15 states . as o-@xmath15 is much less affected by @xmath1 , the small amount of dos is not removed perfectly .",
    "another important factor is the double - counting energy correction for which several functional forms have been suggested @xcite , but there is no well defined solution still yet @xcite : as the double - counting energy is typically represented by @xmath35 , the lda@xmath2 charge self - consistency adjusts @xmath36 ( or , the effective @xmath12-level energy and therefore the charge transfer energy , @xmath37 ) , depending on @xmath1 . according to the recent dmft study , which tunes the double - counting term as a parameter , the system eventually becomes insulating at large @xmath1 @xcite . therefore the small states around the fermi level obtained by lda@xmath2 can be attributed to the double - counting error that is hardly handled within the current formalism of lda@xmath2 .",
    "an interesting recent finding on ( 3-dimensional ) nickelates is that the metal - insulator transition occurs at the very narrow region of @xmath36 and the same holds for the cuprates @xcite .",
    "from the single - site dmft calculations with a double - counting energy as another tuning parameter , wang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that there is a well defined @xmath38 , that is , the critical value of @xmath12-valency of transition metal ; the system is metallic if @xmath39 and insulating if @xmath40 . for nickelates , @xmath41 .",
    "that is , for the parameters ( implicitly including double - counting correction ) , which result in @xmath39 , the system remains metallic even for the very large @xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion suggests @xmath36 as the critical variable for understanding charge - transfer systems @xcite",
    ". now it might be instructive to analyze our lda@xmath2 results within this new picture of ref .  .",
    "even if lda@xmath2 is a lower level approximation compared to dmft , a big merit of lda@xmath2 is that it can be performed with the whole charge self - consistency and take magnetism into account while the previous dmft calculations have dealt with the pm phase @xcite .",
    "[ evsu](d ) presents @xmath36 for pm ( @xmath1=0 ) and fm ( @xmath1=3 , 5 , 7 ) calculations of ( lno)@xmath42/(lao)@xmath13 and ( lno)@xmath43/(lao)@xmath13 .",
    "while @xmath36 decreases as @xmath1 increases , the difference is not significant ; @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the current implementation of lda@xmath2 and the charge self - consistency roughly follow the constant @xmath36 line .",
    "now we note that the value of @xmath45 is far from the @xmath46 predicted by dmft .",
    "therefore it is consistent with the metallic ground state and supports the conclusion of ref .  .",
    "relative orbital occupation in the two @xmath4 orbitals is a central quantity in understanding lno / lao systems @xcite .",
    "the orbital polarization can be non - zero due to the translation symmetry breaking induced by heterostructuring while the bulk polarization is 0 . according to the previous calculations , highly polarized",
    "@xmath18 can possibly drives the system to be high - t@xmath3 superconductor @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a more recent dmft calculation based on the realistic model hamiltonian including oxygen orbitals predicted that the polarization is actually reduced by the on - site correlation @xcite . since both of the previous dmft calculations assumed pm phase and did not consider the full charge self - consistency , lda@xmath2 calculation can give a complimentary information for the magnetic solution in spite of its limitation in describing correlation effect compared to dmft . the result is presented in fig .  [ pvsm ] . it is noted that the inclusion of @xmath1 reduces the polarization significantly .",
    "there is a large separation between @xmath1=0 and @xmath1=3 results , while the differences between @xmath1=3 and 5 results are small .",
    "importantly the calculated polarizations for finite @xmath1 are order - of - magnitude same compared with the recent dmft results @xcite .",
    "therefore it supports the conclusion of the recent dmft calculation @xcite . the small polarization at the finite @xmath1 can also be seen in dos presented in fig .",
    "[ pdos_fm_u5 ] where no big difference can be found between the two @xmath4 orbital occupations .",
    "we note that the reduced orbital polarization by @xmath1 can be compatible with the ferromagnetic spin order . for cuprates , for example , the fully polarized @xmath47 orbital is directly related to the in - plane afm spin order . in the nickelates",
    ", we have one more orbital degree of freedom available and the spin can align ferromagnetically .",
    "and actually it is found that the enhanced ferromagnetic trend by increasing @xmath1 corresponds to the reduced orbital polarization as shown in fig .  [ pvsm ] .",
    "using the band structure calculations based on lda@xmath2 , we examined the magnetic moment , electronic structure , @xmath12-valence , and orbital polarization as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath7 ( lno thickness ) .",
    "the calculated results clearly showed the formation of magnetic moment at the finite @xmath1 region being consistent with a recent @xmath28sr , but the long range ordering pattern is not so clear considering the experiment .",
    "while @xmath27 band width is reduced as @xmath7 approaches to 1 , it may not be enough to be responsible for the metal - insulator transition .",
