    "the pixel sizes of mips 70 and 160 @xmath2 m are 4@xmath6 and 8@xmath6 respectively , along with very low spatial resolutions , so they are not included in our later study .",
    "there are mainly three components in 8 @xmath2 m band , they are the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , dust - continuum emission and stellar continuum . to obtain properties of the dust emission , the contribution of stellar continuum should be removed .",
    "we used a scaled irac 3.6 @xmath2 m image as the stellar continuum with the assumption that the entire 3.6 @xmath2 m band emission is from old stellar population .",
    "the scale factor of 0.232 @xcite is adopted , which has also been used many times by other authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this coefficient was derived with the assumption that the irac 3.6 @xmath2 m emission is all due to stars , and based on the starburst99 synthesis model @xcite .",
    "occasional foreground stars located in the fields of ngc 7479 were almost removed by this technique , which suggests that this approach is fairly accurate in removing stellar emission .",
    "although the 3.6 @xmath2 m image is also somewhat contaminated by dust emission and red giant stars , particularly in the star forming regions , this component has only an impact of less than a few percent on the stellar continuum subtraction process @xcite .",

    "we made object masking following the method in @xcite .",
    "first , we used sextractor @xcite to detect objects in each image , and then we selected the field stars and background galaxies using the parameters ( flux and class_star ) yielded from the first step .",

    "as to the uv images , there are a mount of star formation regions located in them , it is hard to detect stars from these regions exactly , so the masking was not performed to these images .",
    "this reduction was also not made to 5.8@xmath2 m , 8.0@xmath2 m , 24@xmath2 m images because the contribution from those masking objects could be negligible in mid - ir .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the final uv , optical , infrared images . from the figure",
    ", a strong stellar bar can be found in optical and near infrared images , and large asymmetry exists in uv and far infrared images .",
    "in order to study the global properties of ngc  7479 , we used iraf task ellipse to make the surface photometry of multi - band images .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile , ellipticity ( _ e _ ) and position angle ( pa ) were included in photometric results of each band .",
    "the bar structure was obviously identified by following the method in @xcite .",
    "the characteristic bar signature is that _ e _ increases continuously untill reaching a maximum @xmath10 , meanwhile pa remains a constant , and at the end of the bar , _ e _ falls rapidly and position angle changes correspondingly .",
    "@xmath10 was adopted as the ellipticity of the bar and the bar length was derived as the semi - major axis at which the maximum ellipticity was reached .",
    "we also found a slight jump in the bar region from the radial surface brightness profile . based on r band image",
    ", we got that the length of the bar is about 8.3 kpc , the ellipticity 0.733 , both are larger than their mean values in the local universe , @xmath03.5 kpc and @xmath00.6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the length is much larger than the mean bar size of sbc galaxies , which is 2.35 @xmath11 1.22 kpc derived by @xcite .",
    "the ellipticity is also in the upper range of those in sb / sbc galaxies , which lie in the range 0.350.80 as derived by @xcite .",
    "because different band images have different spatial resolution as mentioned in sec  [ data ] , we did the surface photometry with two sets of radial profiles : one radial step of 3.05@xmath6 ( for optical and irac images ) , the other of 6.1@xmath6 ( for uv and 24 @xmath2 m images ) . in order to get the same regions of different bands and compare with previous results",
    "easily , we used fixed centric position , ellipticity and position angle from the values provided in rc3 @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the properties of profiles mainly follow three behaviors : ( 1)mid - ir . in 24 @xmath2 m band , there is a sharp inner cutoff at @xmath020@xmath6 , and there are also cutoffs at smaller radii in 8 @xmath2 m and 5.8 @xmath2 m images .",
    "two factors may cause the high infrared brightness in the inner region : the first is that there are plenty of gas and dust reservoired in the central region , which are traced by 24 @xmath2 m and 8 @xmath2m(dust ) emission , respectively ; the other might be that the emission is affected by the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , especially for the 24 @xmath2 m flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "uv emission is mainly dominated by young stars .",
    "no strong peaks of uv profiles are found as those in infrared in the central region , this may be due to the strong dust attenuation .",
    "( 3)optical & near - ir .",
    "these profiles are relatively smooth and no obvious jumps can be found in the inner and outer disk .",
    "all the uv and optical photometric results have been corrected by the galactic extinction with the assumption of the @xcite extinction curve and r@xmath12 = 3.1 .",
    "the rotational asymmetry as a tool of describing properties of nearby and distant galaxies has been used in many studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the asymmetry is calculated following equation ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) in @xcite , i.e. , comparing the image completely inverted ( i.e. , the rotation angle is @xmath13 ) and the original counterpart : @xmath14,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are intensities of the original and rotated images , @xmath17 is the sky noise , @xmath18 is the number of pixels within the aperture used to derive the asymmetry .",
    "the results are plotted in the top panel of figure  [ fig3 ] as a function of wavelength .",
    "the asymmetry is highest in fuv , which is nearly 0.4 , and then it drops to 0.11 - 0.12 in the optical wavelength .",
    "we got another maximal value 0.27 at 5.8 @xmath2 m and 8 @xmath2 m as we moved toward longer wavelength from optical to infrared .",
    "it is consistent with what we found from figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the asymmetry of h@xmath3 image is @xmath00.226 a little smaller than the nuv value .",
    "the high asymmetry is probably due to the following reasons .",
    "the recent star formation regions traced by uv have a clumpy and extended spatial distribution and these regions sprawl out not only in the galactic center but also in the disk , which is not like middle and old aged stars traced by the optical and near infrared .",
    "the 5.8 @xmath2 m and 8 @xmath2 m emission are possibly due to 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 @xmath2 m pahs emission , although a large amount of dust is concentrated in the bulge and bar regions as the obvious dust lane along the bar is the proof , there are also a certain amount of dust in the arms and disk .",
    "the concentration indexes are the ratios of two radii containing fixed fraction of the total galactic flux and they are widely used to identify structural properties of galaxies and infer the galactic morphological types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as these indexes are relative parameters not affected by external factors .",
    "here we adopt the index c@xmath19",
    "@xcite defined to be @xmath20 where r@xmath21 and r@xmath22 are the radii along the semi - major axis containing 80% and 20% of the total luminosity . the bottom panel of figure  [ fig3 ] shows the result along the wavelength , presenting a much different behavior .",
    "the index at uv is very small ( @xmath02 ) due to the contribution of the diffused young stars in the disk , and it is still small in optical wavelength . while in ir",
    ", c@xmath19 jumps to maximal values 6.8 at 4.5 @xmath2 m and 7.5 at 5.8 @xmath2 m , and goes down at 8.0 @xmath2 m for the spatial distribution of dust .",
    "then it raises again at 24 @xmath2 m due to its intense emission in the central region .      in the h@xmath3 image ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , we can find that most h ii regions are located in the bar and two very asymmetric arms .",
    "these regions have been investigated in previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these studies are mainly focused on the global properties of the h ii regions over the whole galaxy , from which the properties of star formation in different galactic structural regions ca nt be studied clearly . therefore , in order to analyze properties of star formation regions situated in different structures , we marked 13 different regions along the bar and arms in figure  [ fig4 ] . because we focused on the entire properties of different regions",
    "not just on separated star formation clumps , several clumps are always contained in one marked region , which has the aperture of different radii and shape with each other .",
    "it should be noted that the results from this step just make sense on average in each region along with a certain degree of uncertainties . in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    "all regions are marked with boundaries and labels on the h@xmath3 image , including the southern and northern parts of the bar ( noted as bs and bn ) , the bulge region ( center ) , three parts along the eastern arm , i.e. , the weaker one ( ae1ae3 ) , four parts along the other arm ( aw1aw4 ) , and two parts at the interface between the bar and arms ( ban and bas ) .",
    "the detailed information of each part is listed in table 2 .",
    "we made photometry of the entire galaxy and every marked region using the ellipse task in iraf on multi - wavelength images .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tabl2 ] , and they are also plotted in figure  [ fig5 ] as the spectral energy distributions along the wavelength . to make the seds more accurately",
    ", we also added the photometric results from near - ir images of the j , h , and ks two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) bands @xcite .",
    "for the entire galaxy , the fluxes vary by a factor of two orders of magnitude from 0.01jy in the uv to above 3.5jy in 24 @xmath2 m .",
    "the optical fluxes are similar to the flux at 3.6 @xmath2 m and they are dominated by the stellar emission .",
    "there is a steep slope from uv to optical wavelength , probably due to the balmer jump or 4000@xmath23 break .",
    "it is clearly that the highest ir - flux and lowest uv emission lay at the galactic center in the thirteen structural regions . in previous studies ,",
    "the nucleus of ngc 7479 was classified as seyfert 1.9 @xcite , thus the emission from this region may be seriously affected by agn , and it is hard to determine the proportion of the contribution from the agn .",
    "especially , the profiles of two regions in the bar also have higher ir emission than the regions in two spiral arms . for other seds ,",
    "the profiles of regions from the same galactic structures are similar with each other , while all of their ir emission is much lower than that of the center .",
    "star formation rates ( sfrs ) are very important to describe the activities of galactic star formation .",
    "many tracers have been explored to estimate sfrs in different types of galaxies from uv to ir including broadband photometry and emission line luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", the central region shows the highest 24@xmath2 m excess .",
    "two barred regions also have higher f(24@xmath2m)/f(8@xmath2 m ) than the arm regions , it is likely that the f(24@xmath2 m ) of both barred regions is overestimated due to the contamination from the diffraction of the galactic nucleus in 24@xmath2 m image .",

    "we summarized our result of spectral synthesis in table [ tabl3 ] .",
    "this result indicates that there were strong star formation activity on the bar @xmath0100myr ago , especially at the two ends of the bar , where young stars account for a much higher percentage . besides that",
    ", we can also learn that the stellar bar may have been @xmath0 10gyr old as old stars contribute to a large fraction in mass .",
    "ngc 7479 is an interesting example with the strong stellar bar , and have likely suffered a minor merger because of some features mentioned above .",
    "the active star formation and distinctive morphology are evidences of the secular evolution driven by the stellar bar and maybe also by the minor merger event . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the effects of both drivers to our galaxy , respectively .",
    "based on what we have obtained above , the sfr in the bulge region of ngc7479 is @xmath0 1 @xmath32 .",
    "the star formation activity in this region is likely related to the presence of the large - scale bar .",
    "theoretically , stellar bars can concentrate a substantial fraction of disk gas in small galactocentric radii as a result of star formation @xcite .",
    "observations also find that galaxies with stellar bars show higher central sfrs than unbarred ones on average ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the star formation in circumnuclear regions of spiral galaxies are more dependent on stellar bars than that in their outer disks @xcite . using mid - ir color to trace star formation activity , @xcite also found that the color distributions of strong barred galaxies show 15 @xmath2 m excesses , which are absent from weakly barred or unbarred galaxies . using the specific sfr in the galactic central region of ngc 7479 ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) , we estimated that the growth time of the bulge at present sfr is about 50 @xmath0 100 myr , while @xcite derived that the median pseudobulge could have grown the present - day stellar mass in 8 gyr , which is much longer than that of ngc 7479",
    ". therefore , there is probably another factor affecting the evolution of this galaxy .    besides the bulge , star formation activity is also located in the galactic bar of ngc 7479 .",
    "@xcite studied the morphological properties of h ii regions in the bar of ngc 7479 using its h@xmath3 image and found that the total sfr from h ii regions in the bar excluding nucleus and circumnuclear region is about 0.4m@xmath28yr@xmath29 . @xcite also found the sfr is about 0.5m@xmath28yr@xmath29 in the bar region , though this value is lower than what we have estimated using composite tracers .",
    "previous studies also revealed that there is a large mount of gas distributing along the bar . using co ( j=1 @xmath33 0 ) observations",
    ", @xcite found that co emission in ngc 7479 is along the dust lane traversing the whole bar and nucleus .",
    "@xcite also found that a continuous gas distribution is all along the bar in ngc 7479 and the distributions of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , dust lanes and velocity gradient have complex relationships .",
    "the radio continuum emission at 21 cm in the galactic central region shows the similar behavior as the co emission @xcite .",
    "the distribution of star formation activity and gas in the bar may be a result of the concentration of gas inflowing from the disk under the influence of the bar , because the gravitational torque of the large - scale bar can make the gas lose angular momentum , and then drive it down inward through the stellar bar @xcite .",
    "in general , star formation locates in the circumnuclear regions and in the ends of bars , while bars are typically dominated by evolved stellar populations @xcite . in the study of the barred spiral ngc 5383 , @xcite found weak h@xmath3 emission in the bar between the bar ends and the central region , despite the high gas column density in the bar dust lanes .",
    "similarly , weak star formation in the bar takes place in ngc 1530 , probably due to the inhibition of the shear and shock in the dust lanes @xcite .",
    "however , as figure  [ fig1 ] shows , obvious h@xmath3 emission takes place in the bar of ngc 7479 , and a majority of young stars are formed in nearly 100myr ( see table  [ tabl3 ] ) . in addition , the sfr in the bar region is also comparable with those in the bulge and bar ends ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "for that reason , the existence of star formation activity appears to be consistent with not only the galactic bar , but also another effect ( see the next subsection ) .",
    "how does the bar affect the evolution of ngc 7479 ?",
    "@xcite found that the gas inflow rate along the stellar bar is about 46 m@xmath26yr@xmath29 in this galaxy , which is much larger than the sfr in the bar region we derived ( 1.24 m@xmath26yr@xmath29 ) .",
    "therefore , before turning into stars a large percent of gas will drop into the galactic central region and make the bulge mass addition @xcite . in this case , this galaxy will possibly evolve toward an earlier galaxy type , although there is a doubt that a late - type galaxy maybe not evolve into an early type via bar - induced gas inflow @xcite . therefore , ngc 7479 is likely just in a transitional stage .    in order to explore the bar - driven secular evolution ,",
    "@xcite classified 10 different barred galaxies into three evolutionary stages based on the dynamical properties and dust morphology : ( i ) type i non starburst , the early stages of bar - driven inflow , where large amounts of gas are along the bar and there is low star formation efficiency in the inner few kiloparsecs ; ( ii ) type ii non starburst , the later stages of bar - driven inflow where most molecular gas is concentrated in inner kpc and star formation only occurs in regions with high gas densities ; subsequently , ( iii ) circurmnuclear starburst , where large fraction of molecular gas is concentrated in galactic central region , exists intense star formation activity . comparing our results with this scenario",
    "suggests that ngc 7479 may be in type i non starburst evolutionary phase based on the properties of star formation and molecular gas in this galaxy .",
    "ngc 7479 is similar to ngc 4569 , which is the prototype of type i non starburst in the work of @xcite . with a sample of barred galaxies",
    ", @xcite also put forward a scenarios of bar - driven secular evolutionary sequence using properties of h@xmath3 emission , in which they defined four main groups , i.e. , group e , a strong central peak in the h@xmath3 emission , no h@xmath3 emission in bar ; group g , h@xmath3 emission in the bar ; group eg , a transition between the e and g groups ; group f , with less gas , smoother morphology and no central emission spot in h@xmath3 , and argued that the evolutionary sequence is g @xmath33 eg @xmath33 e @xmath33 f. in their studies , ngc 7479 is classified as group g. similar results are also found by @xcite , our galaxy suggested to be in the middle transitional type in their three stages of evolutionary sequence .",
    "thus , as performed by above authors , ngc 7479 is in a temporal transitional phase . under the effect of its stellar bar ,",
    "most of molecular gas will be concentrated in the inner kpc of the galactic center , starburst can be triggered in circumnuclear region when most of the gas exceeds a critical density , and pseudobulges is expected to be built in the inner kpc .",
    "then ngc 7479 may become a galaxy with a earlier hubble type . on the other hand",
    ", the increase of the infrared luminosity may also make our galaxy a luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ) , this may explain why there are some lirgs are isolated barred galaxies but not interacting systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "minor merger event is a common phenomenon in the universe . according to statistics , each field spiral galaxy has more than one companions on average @xcite .",
    "thus , the interactions between galaxies and their companions are believed to be very common @xcite .",
    "several properties of ngc 7479 indicate the presence of a recent minor merger .",
    "first of all , as we mentioned in sec  [ discussion_bar ] , star formation activity in the bar and bulge of our galaxy is stronger than most common barred galaxies .",
    "the systems in minor mergers have higher sfr than those found in normal h ii regions of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "minor mergers also likely play a role in enhancing the infrared luminosity for some low - luminosity galaxies @xcite .",
    "these features are likely caused by a large amount of gas which was driven into host galactic disks when they swallowed gas - rich satellites , and the gas may also be transported into the galactic inner regions due to bars .",
    "second , in numerical simulations , vertical impact of small companions can cause asymmetries to gas - rich barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that minor merger can form significant disk asymmetry , visible for at least 1 gyr in their simulations .",
    "similarly , the simulations of @xcite indicate that minor mergers in some conditions can create a strong asymmetry when the galaxy appears to be `` isolated '' , once the most obvious merger related features have disappeared . through comparing the distribution of different compositions in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    ", we found that star formation regions of ngc 7479 are largely concentrated in the strong arm , and pah emission is mostly distributed along the stellar bar and the strong spiral arm .",
    "probably because of this reason , the asymmetry of ngc 7479 is much higher in uv , mid - infrared , as well as h@xmath3 band ( a @xmath0 0.3 ) , than that in the optical and near - infrared bands .",
    "third , minor mergers are probably related to the triggering of stellar bars @xcite . since active star formation exists in the bar of ngc 7479 ,",
    "the intense gas concentration and young stars in the stellar bar are probably driven by the minor merger event in some degree besides the stellar bar .",
    "the large percentage of burst population in the bar of ngc 7479 ( table  [ tabl3 ] ) are evidently formed in recent hundred myr .",
    "furthermore , as argued by @xcite there is strong evidence that the present morphology of ngc 7479 was acquired following a merging event with a small galaxy about 300 myr ago . in addition , the radio continuum jet in ngc 7479 found by @xcite is another signal of recent perturbation by a minor merger in this galaxy , and is similar with the cause of jets in ngc 1097 @xcite . through the comparison between the simulation model of minor merger and observation",
    ", @xcite suggested that ngc 7479 is the result of minor merger which is still under process , and the remnant of the satellite galaxy likely locates within the bar . besides the minor merger , there are likely other processes to contribute large amounts of gas to the evolution of ngc 7479 .",
    "for example , galaxy tidal encounters @xcite and external gas accretion @xcite that can also result in material infalling ; in the simulation of @xcite , a tidal encounter or the accreted low angular momentum material could also strengthen the bar .",
    "although morphological properties of ngc 7479 are consistent with characteristics of minor merger , no companions have been found in the field of this galaxy @xcite . to explore whether any remnant of merging companions is still existing , we compared 0.212.0 kev x - ray images from xmm - newton telescope , high - resolution images from hst proposal 6266 with wfpc2 and the f814w filter . since ultraluminous compact x - ray sources are probably dwarf companion galaxy nuclei @xcite , and merger remnants if still exist are also likely located in compact optical sources , we try to find possible candidates from these sources .",
    "in figure  [ fig9 ] we marked 10 candidates , among which there are 4 strong x - ray emission peaks ( labeled as x1-x4 ) detected in x - ray image and 5 intensive optical regions ( labeled as o1-o5 ) in hst image , the last one is a potential target pointed by @xcite ( marked with l ) . besides those",
    ", the nucleus of the host galaxy ( marked as c ) can also be clearly detected by xmm images .",
    "target x4 is the nearest ( @xmath01kpc ) x - ray emission peak to the galactic nucleus c , and it lies in the most obscured region , which may be the reason it ca nt be identified in optical wavelength , and distinguished from the nucleus .",
    "therefore , we could not do the further investigations for this source .",
    "target x1 located in the north end of the bar , has the most x - ray emission flux in the five peaks ( assuming they are at the same distance ) , but it may be the foreground star 2mass j23045696 + 1220390 if we consider the error in pointing ( the mean error of 8@xmath6 ) and resolution ( spatial resolution 6@xmath6 fwhm ) of xmm - newton telescope .",
    "target x2 and x3 are both located in the west strong spiral arm .",
    "x2 can be detected obviously from the high - resolution optical image from hst . in the position x3 , there is an optical counterpart with very weak emission , which is only @xmath06@xmath6 from the compact source h4 , also not far from two faint sources h3 and h5 . h1 and",
    "h2 are located on the strong arm and near the stellar bar , especially h2 can not be resolved even in the images of hst .",
    "the potential target l lies on the north of the galactic nucleus in the bar , where there is little x - ray emission but an bright optical counterpart .",
    "the detailed information is listed in table  [ tabl4 ] , the coordinates of x - ray candidates are from xmm - newton detection , and their luminosity ( l@xmath36 ) are including the emission from 0.2kev to 12kev .    for further investigations of properties of candidates , we made aperture photometry with radius of 6@xmath6 to get their seds ( figure  [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "due to the low spatial resolution , we used the sum flux of x3 and h4 to plot their sed .",
    "we also obtain the vsg - to - pah ratio using f(24@xmath2m)/f(8@xmath2 m ) and surface sfr using eq .",
    "[ eq_sfr2 ] with small photometric apertures ( radii of @xmath02@xmath6 ) ( see table  [ tabl4 ] ) .",
    "we found 3 sources have the positive ratios and 4 sources have surface sfr higher than 0.3 m@xmath28yr@xmath29 kpc@xmath37 . by comparing these plots",
    ", we found that sources l and h3 have similar seds with the nucleus c , and they also have higher vsg - to - pah ratios , which indicates they are more likely in the criteria region of agns @xcite .",
    "thus , under the consideration of the two aspects , we suggest that the sources l and h3 are more likely remnants of the minor merger event .",
    "in this paper , we present a multi - wavelength study of properties of the isolated barred galaxy ngc 7479 with ground - based optical images and spectra combining with galex uv and spitzer ir data .",
    "our results are as follows .",
    "we took the surface photometry from far - uv , optical to mid - ir , and obtained radial profile of each band , and found that these profiles show different behaviors in different wavelengths . based on r band image",
    ", we derived that the stellar bar in ngc 7479 is 8.3 kpc in length , 0.733 in ellipticity .",
    "\\2 . calculating the morphological asymmetry and concentration index of ngc 7479",
    ", we found that the asymmetry of this galaxy is high in uv and mid - ir as well as the h@xmath3 narrow band , while the concentration index is much small in uv and locates peak values in pah emissions .",
    "the properties of star formation regions in ngc 7479 are analyzed using several tracers .",
    "intense star formation activity is found to take place on the bar and one strong spiral arm , which also has the highest special sfrs in the disk .",
    "the star formation activity on our stellar bar is comparable with those in the central region and in the ends of the bar , while the growth time of our galactic bulge at present - day sfr is also shorter than the typical value of gyrs derived by @xcite    \\4 . with the help of stellar synthesis code starlight",
    ", we found that strong star formation took place in the bar about 100myr ago , and the stellar bar may have been @xmath0 10gyr old as old stars contribute to a large fraction in mass .",
    "\\5 . by comparing our results with previous studies",
    ", we suggested that our galaxy is in a temporal and transitional phase of the secular evolution . under the effect of its galactic bar , ngc 7479",
    "may become an earlier type galaxy or a lirg finally .",
    "the properties of active star formation and distinctive morphology in ngc 7479 also indicate that a minor merger event likely happened recently .",
    "if so , ten possible remnants of merger companions are measured , among which two candidates have been found .    in order to understand the roles of large - scale bars and minor merger to galaxy secular evolution , studies based on large samples are necessary . in the next step work",

    "<S> large - scale bars and minor mergers are important drivers for the secular evolution of galaxies . based on ground - based optical images and spectra as well as ultraviolet data from the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ and infrared data from the _ spitzer space telescope _ , we present a multi - wavelength study of star formation properties in the barred galaxy ngc 7479 , which also has obvious features of a minor merger . using various tracers of star formation </S>",
    "<S> , we find that under the effects of both a stellar bar and a minor merger , star formation activity mainly takes place along the galactic bar and arms , while the star formation rate changes from the bar to the disk . with the help of spectral synthesis </S>",
    "<S> , we find that strong star formation took place in the bar region about 100 myr ago , and the stellar bar might have been @xmath010 gyr old . by comparing our results with the secular evolutionary scenario from jogee et al . </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that ngc 7479 is possibly in a transitional stage of secular evolution at present , and it may eventually become an earlier type galaxy or a luminous infrared galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the probable minor merger event happened recently in ngc 7479 , and we find two candidates for minor merger remnants . </S>"
