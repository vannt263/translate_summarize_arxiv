    "this paper extends the result in @xcite by k. sato and the second author , and also the result in @xcite by the first author .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that , although the only complete connected finite - total - curvature minimal immersions in @xmath2 with two embedded ends are catenoids ( schoen @xcite ) , there do exist complete connected immersed constant mean curvature ( cmc ) @xmath0 surfaces with two ends in hyperbolic @xmath1-space @xmath3 that are not surfaces of revolution , although such non - rotational surfaces in @xmath3 can not be embedded ( levitt and rosenberg @xcite ) .",
    "the examples found in @xcite are of genus one , but there exist examples of genus zero as well , called warped catenoid cousins , which we comment on later in this introduction .",
    "this comparison is of interest , because minimal surfaces in @xmath2 and cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath3 are lawson correspondents , and therefore have a very close relationship @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "analogous spacelike surfaces in de sitter @xmath1-space @xmath4 were shown to exist . likewise , in this non - riemannian situation , there is a similar close relationship between spacelike maximal surfaces in minkowski @xmath1-space @xmath5 and spacelike cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath6 .",
    "the interest in these surfaces stems largely from the nature of their singular sets .",
    "there is a well - known classical weierstrass representation for minimal surfaces in @xmath2 , and a very similar weierstrass type representation for maximal surfaces in @xmath7 ( @xcite , @xcite for example ) .",
    "because of the relationships described above , we have again weierstrass type representations for cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath3 ( @xcite , @xcite for example ) and for cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these representations are used here , for @xmath3 and @xmath6 , in equations and .",
    "furthermore , because of all of these relationships , the osserman inequality for minimal surfaces in @xmath2 has analogs for maximal surfaces in @xmath7 ( @xcite ) , and cmc 1 surfaces in @xmath3 ( @xcite ) and @xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .      1 .   the method of @xcite can be extended to give examples of any positive genus up to genus twenty , and probably any even higher genus as well , without requiring a multi - dimensional period problem ( showing that a simplification of a comment made in the introduction of @xcite is possible ) , and 2 .   in light of recent work on cmc @xmath0 surfaces with singularities in @xmath4 ,",
    "the same method will give cmc @xmath0 surfaces of any genus ( at least up to genus twenty ) and two embedded ends in @xmath4 , and 3 .",
    "although the cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath3 and @xmath6 have a similar mathematical construction , the behavior of the ends of the surfaces in @xmath6 is more complicated to analyze , related to the fact that the group @xmath8 used in the @xmath6 case is not compact ( although @xmath9 , used in @xmath3 , is ) . to demonstrate this",
    ", we find a family of surfaces in @xmath6 with hyperbolic ends ( the term `` hyperbolic ends '' was defined in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "cmc @xmath0 surfaces with certain kinds of singularities in @xmath4 were called cmc @xmath0 faces in @xcite and @xcite . regarding the third point above , in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was shown that ends of cmc @xmath0 faces in @xmath6 come in three types : elliptic , hyperbolic and parabolic .",
    "however , ends of cmc @xmath0 surfaces in @xmath3 will always be elliptic .",
    "because of this , in the @xmath6 case an extra argument is needed to demonstrate the numerical result just below , and we give that argument at the end of this paper .",
    "our main result is this :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ * numerical result : * there exists a one - parameter family of cmc @xmath0 genus @xmath10 complete properly immersed surfaces in @xmath3 with two embedded ends , for any positive integer @xmath11 .",
    "likewise , again for any positive integer @xmath11 , there exist two one - parameter families of genus @xmath10 cmc @xmath0 faces in @xmath4 , one with two complete embedded elliptic ends , and one with two weakly complete ( in the sense of @xcite ) hyperbolic ends .",

    "the surfaces in the above numerical result are not known to exist by any rigorous mathematical method , so , like in @xcite and @xcite , we rely on numerics at one step to show this result .",
    "in particular , we show numerically that a certain continuous function from the real line to the real line is positive at one point and negative at another , thus implying by the intermediate value theorem that it has a zero .",
    "we provide some graphics of higher genus catenoids in @xmath3 , see figure [ fg : gkcats ] .",
    "( because the surfaces in @xmath6 have singularities , making them more difficult to visualize globally , the computer graphics become less helpful in this case , and we do not show such graphics here . )      1 .",
    "although there do not exist any genus @xmath0 complete connected finite - total - curvature minimal immersions in @xmath2 with two embedded ends , there do exist genus @xmath0 maximal surfaces ( they can actually be complete maxfaces in the sense of @xcite ) with two embedded ends in @xmath5 .",
    "see kim - yang @xcite .",
    "2 .   if one allows the ends to be non - embedded , there do exist examples of complete connected finite - total - curvature minimal surfaces with two ends and positive genus .",
    "see fujimori - shoda @xcite for example .",
    "let @xmath17 be a solution to .",
    "note that , in order to determine the type of monodromy about an end , we only need to know the eigenvalues of the monodromy ( provided those eigenvalues are not @xmath18 ) , and this is independent of the choice of @xmath19 .",
    "so we may choose any solution to .",
    "we then have @xmath20 and @xmath21 because of the symmetry @xmath22 , it suffices to determine the type of just one end , and then the other end will automatically have the same type .",
    "so let us choose the end @xmath23 .",
    "at this end , @xmath24 is a local coordinate for the riemann surface @xmath25 . in terms of @xmath24 , and",
    "considering @xmath26 as a function of @xmath24 , the equations above become @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the landau symbol , that is , @xmath29 is a holomorphic function @xmath30 around @xmath23 so that @xmath31 .",
    "it follows that the difference of the solutions of the indicial equation corresponding to the first of these two equations is @xmath32 likewise , the difference of solutions of the indicial equation for the second equation above takes the same value .",
    "it follows ( see the appendix of @xcite for further details ) that the end is elliptic ( resp .",
