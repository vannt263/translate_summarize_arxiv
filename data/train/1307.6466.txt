    "the system is thus referred to as viscoelastic .",
    "the internal noise in this case corresponds to fractional gaussian noise , i.e. gaussian noise with power law correlations .",

    "the above equality is a fundamental property of equilibrium systems and , from a practical point of view , allows to infer the response of the system to an external perturbation solely by studying its diffusive behavior .",
    "since @xmath24 , the equilibrium system is always subdiffusive .    in living cells , however , a tracer particle is not only acted upon by the internal thermal noise",
    ", it also experiences forces due to the active components of the cytoplasm , e.g. molecular motors moving along microtubuli or actin filaments .",
    "while these often lead to straight , directed motion , it has been realized recently that they also result in random , diffusive - like motion @xcite .",
    "we model the latter by introducing an additional , external noise term @xmath25 into the langevin equation following ref .",
    "this external noise does not satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation relation and drives the system out of equilibrium .",
    "the expression for the creep function will be left unchanged by the presence of the unbiased external noise , but there will be an additional contribution to the mean - square displacement . in order to reproduce the measured power - law behavior of the noise power spectrum @xcite , the correlation function of the external noise was taken to be of the form @xcite , @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the above expression was shown to quantitatively describe the experimentally observed transition between subdiffusion and superdiffusion of melanosomes in xenopus laevis melanocytes , as well as to provide a good estimate of in vivo motor forces @xcite",
    ". however , the correlation function is stationary , as it only depends on the time difference @xmath28",
    ". we will show below that it fails to account for the nonstationary behavior observed in a majority of experiments @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will hence use a more general form of the noise correlation function which , in laplace space , reads , @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the laplace transform of the function @xmath31 . in the time domain , the correlation function becomes ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the incomplete beta function @xcite .",

    "in this regime , the external noise is akin to the internal one , but more strongly correlated for @xmath39 . by contrast , for @xmath40 , the external noise stays nonstationary and its variance grows with time as @xmath41 .",
    "figure  [ fig0 ] summarizes the properties of the noise correlations in the different regimes .",
    "we emphasize that our results will not depend on the specific form of the correlation function , but only on its asymptotic behavior at long times .     as a function of the time difference @xmath28 .",

    "we find , @xmath68 the equilibrium mean - square displacement correctly describes the dynamics in the time window @xmath69 , while the nonequilibrium external noise term dominates for @xmath70 .    the behavior of the mean - square displacement can be better understood by calculating the velocity autocorrelation function , which for long times is given by ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath71 expression is stationary and decays as a power law ; it is negative for @xmath72 and positive for @xmath66 .",

    "can be neglected asymptotically , and we have therefore @xmath76 .",
    "the introduction of the effective temperature might at first glance appear purely formal .",
    "however , it gains physical significance by noting that it also measures the departure of the mean - square displacement from its equilibrium expression . indeed , for @xmath77 , the effective temperature is equal to the actual physical temperature @xmath78 , since the equilibrium contribution from the thermal noise dominates at short times ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the asymptotic and transient behavior of the mean - square displacement are related via the effective temperature as , @xmath79 equations and provide two independent and complementary ways to determine the effective temperature : either by combining long - time active and passive measurements ( as expressed by eq .  ) , or by comparing short and long - time behavior in passive measurements alone ( as indicated by eq .  ) . combining both equations ,",
    "the transport properties of the system can thus be gained from passive measurements .",
    "the generalized stokes - einstein relation with the effective temperature therefore enable to connect passive and active microrheology in the nonequilibrium regime .     for @xmath80 and @xmath48 ( @xmath81 ) .",

    "it is thus desirable to define a frequency - dependent effective temperature .",

    "we find , @xmath97 the above definition of the effective temperature is equivalent to the one introduced for the mobility in ref .",
    "two other effective temperatures have been defined in a similar way , via the the spectral density of the position in ref .",
    "@xcite and via the spectral density of the noise in ref .",
    "however , the latter are not suited to the superdiffusive , nonstationary regime as we will discuss below .",
    "the fact that @xmath98 increases with decreasing frequency for @xmath39 indicates that the nonequilibrium properties of the system get more pronounced for low frequencies , corresponding to longer time scales , in complete analogy to the behavior of the effective temperature in time ; both measure the distance of the system from equilibrium .    in eq .",
    "the viscous modulus was related to the power spectral density of the velocity .",
    "does a similar relation hold for the power spectral density of the position ? for the subdiffusive regime @xmath65 ,",
    "the answer is yes ; here , the two spectral densities are connected via , @xmath99 even though the position process is nonstationary ( its variance increases with time ) , its power spectral density does not depend on time in this regime .",

    "by contrast , in the presence of both internal ( equilibrium ) and external ( nonequilibrium ) noise , the dynamics becomes superdiffusive ( black trajectory ) , and the particle covers large distances while still exploring the surrounding area .",
    "the latter allows for both fast transport and facilitated reactions ",
    "this last aspect is missing when only the nonequilibrium noise is present ( red trajectory ) .",
    "the origin of superdiffusion in living cells is thought to be the result of the collective behavior of molecular motors , switching on and off randomly , giving rise to correlated noisy motion @xcite .",
