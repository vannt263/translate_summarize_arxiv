    "chemical abundance patterns in stars reflect the star formation ( sf ) histories of stellar systems : whatever mechanisms contributed to the enrichment of the interstellar medium will leave unique imprints in the resulting chemical abundance ratios . these allow one not only to trace the predominant modes of sf and reconstruct galactic enrichment histories , but also to place important constraints on the nucleosynthetic production sites of the elements . in particular , the @xmath0-elements ( e.g. , o , mg , si , ca , ti ) , produced mainly by massive stars which end as type ii supernovae ( sne ) on short time scales , and the neutron - capture elements ( e.g. y , sr , ba , la ) from agb stars , probe rapid and slow timescales , respectively .",

    "we present the discovery of unusual chemical abundance patterns in two red giants in hercules .",
    "the elemental abundances were identified in the course of a broader observational program dedicated to a high - resolution study of hercules , and the comprehensive abundance analysis of the full sample will be presented elsewhere ( koch et al .",

    "we present the results for two of our red giants , which we label her-2 and her-3 according to their brightness ( v=18.7 and 19.0 mag ) .",
    "the observations were carried out over two nights on 2007 july 1011 with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) spectrograph at the 6.5-m magellan2/clay telescope .",
    "a slit width of 1@xmath11 and a ccd binning of 2@xmath121 pixel resulted in a spectral resolution of 20000 , with a full spectral coverage using the blue and red echelles of 3350 - 9400 .",
    "the stars were observed for a total of four and six hours , respectively .",
    "our data were reduced with the standard mike pipeline reduction package of kelson ( 2003 ) .",
    "the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of our spectra is 32 per pixel at @xmath36500 , but it falls below 10 for the bluer orders .",
    "the radial velocities of the two target stars confirm their membership in her ( simon & geha 2007 ) , but we note that her-3 is probably a binary , based on its radial velocity curve ( d. adn 2008 , private communication ) , although there is no secondary flux detected from the companion . therefore , the companion is most likely very faint and will not affect the present analysis .",
    "the chemical abundances were determined from an equivalent width ( ew ) analysis , where we employed @xmath13-values from the literature .",
    "typically , 1525 lines of sufficient strength could be measured . for most of the other species ,",
    "only a few absorption features were distinguishable ( see table  1 ) , which , coupled with the slightly low s / n led to large scatter in some abundance ratios .",
    "many absorption lines of the heavy elements are too weak to be reliably measured in our spectra , yielding only upper abundance limits .",

    "a reddening of e(b@xmath4v)= 0.06 ( schlegel 1998 ) and the according extinction laws of rieke & lebovsky ( 1985 ) were adopted throughout this work .",

    "our adopted microturbulent velocity values are higher than typical red giant stars with similar parameters .",
    "this is likely an artifact of the relatively low s / n of our spectra , due to asymmetry in abundance errors on strong lines ( magain 1984 ) ; however , we stress that these high microturbulent velocity values are appropriate for our spectra .",
    "hyperfine splitting was included for the even - z elements sc , mn , co , and ba , but is usually negligible for the na lines we used in our stars .",

    ". in particular , almost all of the ultrafaint dsphs studied to date show broad metallicity ranges of this order of magnitude .",
    "in general , a zero - point difference between the cat `` metallicities '' and our [ fe / h ] values can be expected due to the low [ ca / fe ] ( @xmath40.15 ) found here .",
    "navely , we expect a zero - point correction to the cat metallicities based on halo [ ca / fe ] calibrations of @xmath280.50 dex ( see also koch et al . 2008 ) .",
    "this would suggest [ fe / h]=@xmath41.8 from correcting the simon & geha ( 2007 ) metallicities .",
    "we can check this result using our mike spectra , which contain the cat lines ; accordingly , we find cat - based metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath292.39 and @xmath41.72 for her-2 and 3 .",

    "as a glance at table  1 shows , the [ ca / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] ratios of the her stars are at most slightly to moderately enhanced , which is compatible with the abundance ratios found in the more luminous dsphs ( fig .",

    "one has to keep in mind , however , that these values are upper limits based on only one line .",
    "furthermore , the production of si in massive stars , which are required to contribute to peculiar abundance patterns in metal - poor stars , is not yet fully understood ( e.g. , cohen et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "it is striking that both the hydrostatic @xmath0-elements mg and o are strongly enhanced by a factor of about 10 relative to the solar abundance ratios found in the majority of the local group dsphs .",

    "results suggest abundance corrections that reduce our lte values by 0.3 to 0.4 dex .",
    "thus , if non - lte effects on fe are ignored , the [ na / fe ] ratios in our her stars are probably closer to @xmath280.3 dex , rather than @xmath30.7 dex indicated in table  1 .",

    "neither of the her stars , however , shows any ba absorption above the noise level . as a secondary test we synthesized the spectral regions around the ba 6141 and 6496 lines and verified that essentially all of the visible absorption is due to noise and/or a blend with an fe line . as a result , the [ ba / fe ] ratio is compatible with upper limits from the spectral s / n of @xmath33 dex in both stars ( fig .",

    "the same holds for every other heavy n - capture element .",
    "we do not detect the usually prominent line at 4077  above noise , nor are y , la , and eu measurable above the noise , indicating an extraordinary level of depletion .",
    "the only other red giant in a dsph known to date to have strong enhancements in the light elements o , mg , na and al , and a complete n - capture deficiency is dra  119 ( shetrone et al . 1998 ; fulbright et al . 2004 ) .",
    "similar to our her stars , dra  119 is characterized by no significant occurrence of elements heavier than ni .",
    "fulbright et al . ( 2004 ) argue that the chemical patterns seen in dra  119 are explicable with sne ii enrichment by high - mass progenitors of at least 20 m@xmath7 .",
    "theoretical yields ( e.g. , woosley & weaver 1995 ) indicate that the high ratio of hydrostatic to explosive @xmath0 elements ( o and mg , relative to ca , ti ) found in our her stars ( at [ mg / ca]= 0.94 and 0.58 dex , respectively ) , requires nucleosynthesis by relatively high mass type ii sne ( @xmath335 m@xmath35 ) .",
    "moreover , given the strong depletion of ba in the two her stars , sne events in this mass regime apparently do not produce any significant amount of n - capture elements .",
    "given the low luminosity of the her dsph , we consider an incomplete sampling of the high - mass end of the imf as the most likely reason for the dominance of material from @xmath335 m@xmath35 sne  ii ( e.g. , carigi & hernandez 2008 ) .",
    "accordingly , we have performed stochastic chemical evolution experiments to investigate the [ o / mg ] , [ mg / ca ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios , similar to mcwilliam & searle ( 1999 ) .",
    "our calculations employed a miller - scalo ( 1979 ) imf with slope of @xmath42.56 and element yields from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for low - metallicity ( z=10@xmath36 z@xmath35 ) sne  ii progenitors in the mass range 12 to 40 m@xmath35 .",
    "our calculations indicate that the observed [ mg / ca ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios in her are found in less than 1% of systems with 7 to 12 sne  ii events ; approximately 10% of systems possess the observed [ mg / ca ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios after 13 , and @xmath35 sn  ii events respectively . about 10% of systems show the observed [ o / mg ] ratios after 11 sne ii ; this reduced to 1% of systems after 32 sne ii .",
    "thus , our experiment suggests that the abundance ratios can only be reasonably obtained in systems which experienced _ fewer than @xmath311 sne  ii _ enrichment events , although it is more likely that only 13 events were responsible for the chemical composition of our stars .",
    "seemingly at odds with the idea of small numbers of massive sne  ii is the metallicity , at [ fe / h]=@xmath3@xmath42.0 dex ; comparable abundance patterns in the galactic halo stars are only found towards the very metal poor regime ( e.g. , mcwilliam & searle 1999 ; cohen et al .",
    "dra  119 , with a comparably high [ mg / ca ] ratio has a very low [ fe / h ] of almost @xmath37 dex . since audouze & silk ( 1995 ) argue that most individual sne produce [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath44.0 dex , we might statistically expect that @xmath3100 sne contributed to the composition of our her stars .",
    "other notable abundance anomalies in our her stars include the extremely low [ ba / fe ] and enhanced [ co / fe ] ratios",
    ". remarkably , low [ ba / fe ] , high [ co / fe ] and low [ cr / fe ] ratios are typical of halo stars with [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath43.5 ( mcwilliam et al",
    "it is , however , possible , that unusual [ co / cr ] abundance ratios may be partly due to nlte effects .",
    "overall , it is as if the processes typical of the extremely low metallicity galactic halo occurred in the her dwarf at [ fe / h]=@xmath42.0 dex .",
    "we note , however , that the high [ mg / ca ] ratios are inherent to the her stars and not found in the metal poor halo stars .",
    "it is conceivable that our her stars formed from sn ejecta diluted with a much smaller amount of pristine gas than typically occurred in the galactic halo .",
    "if the her stars in fact resemble more the very metal poor galactic halo stars , then their unusual composition could reasonably be due to one , or at most a few , sn events .",
    "this scenario requires that high mass sne  ii produce the enhanced [ co / fe ] and deficient [ cr / fe ] values seen in our her stars ( typical at extremely low metallicity ) . while this scenario might explain our observed her abundances , it leaves unanswered the origin of the enhanced [ co / cr ] ratios in found in extremely metal - poor stars of the galactic halo .",
    "a viable interpretation is that our her stars have an unusually high abundance of nearly pure population iii material , produced and ejected by the first stars .",
    "these first stars are thought to be dominated by zero - metallicity high mass sne  ii ( e.g. yoshida et al .",
    "2008 ) , which would naturally explain the high [ o , mg / fe ] ratios .",
    "this scenario would also easily explain the high [ co / fe ] and low [ cr / fe ] values , if the unusual trends of these two ratios at low [ fe / h ] are due to population iii sn ejecta , as suggested by mcwilliam ( 1997 ) . while this idea removes the aforementioned difficulties associated with the co and cr abundances , the [ mg / ca ] ratios are unlike halo stars near [ fe / h]=@xmath44 .",
    "this scenario leads to the question of why the her dwarf has a concentration of primordial material @xmath330 times that of the low - metallicity halo . perhaps it is related to her s presumably low baryonic mass , which may have formed only one relatively low - mass population iii star that ejected a large amount of population iii fe - peak material .",
    "whatever the cause , it appears that stochastic chemical evolution might reasonably explain the unusual abundance patterns in the her dwarf galaxy ( see also marcolini et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "if true , this would indicate that the chemical enrichment proceeds very differently in very low - mass environments ( see also koch et al . 2008 ) , and that low luminosity dwarf galaxies would be useful for directly measuring the abundance yields of low - metallicity type ii sne .",

    "<S> we report on the abundance analysis of two red giants in the faint hercules dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> these stars show a remarkable deficiency in the neutron - capture elements , while the hydrostatic @xmath0-elements ( o , mg ) are strongly enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> our data indicate [ ba / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios of @xmath1@xmath2 dex and @xmath3 + 0.8 dex , respectively , with essentially no detection of other n - capture elements . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the only other dsph star with similar abundance patterns , dra  119 , which has a very low metallicity at [ fe / h]=@xmath42.95 dex , our objects , at [ fe / h]@xmath3@xmath5 dex , are only moderately metal poor . </S>",
    "<S> the measured ratio of hydrostatic / explosive @xmath0-elements indicates that high - mass ( @xmath6  m@xmath7 ) type ii supernovae progenitors are the main , if not only , contributors to the enrichment of this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that star formation and chemical enrichment in the ultrafaint dsphs proceeds stochastically and inhomogeneously on small scales , or that the imf was strongly skewed to high mass stars . </S>",
    "<S> the neutron capture deficiencies and the [ co / fe ] and [ cr / fe ] abundance ratios in our stars are similar to those in the extremely low metallicity galactic halo . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that either our stars are composed mainly of the ejecta from the first , massive , population  iii stars ( but at moderately high [ fe / h ] ) , or that sn ejecta in the hercules galaxy were diluted with @xmath330 times less hydrogen than typical for extreme metal - poor stars . </S>"
