    "with bolometric luminosities exceeding @xmath5 , ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) represent an extreme class of objects whose spectra are dominated by emission in the far  infrared ( for a review of their properties see  @xcite ) .",
    "the source of their prodigious output is thought to arise in a thick , cool ( t@xmath6100@xmath7 ) nuclear dust structure which reprocesses emission from an obscured agn  like core , a massive star ",
    "formation region , or possibly both ( @xcite ) .",
    "the funneling of fuel into the nucleus and the resultant activity may be triggered by a violent interaction between gas  rich galaxies ( @xcite ) ; this appears to be the case observationally , with @xmath8 of ulirgs displaying disturbed or merging morphology ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently identified in a survey of halo carbon stars , the z=3.87 broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar , apm 08279 + 5255 , was found to be positionally coincident with a source in the iras faint source catalog ( @xcite ) . with a flux of 0.9jy at 100",
    ", this @xmath9 object possesses an inferred bolometric luminosity of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 throughout ) , making apm 08279 + 5255   apparently the most luminous object currently known .",
    "however , ground  based images taken in @xmath13 seeing reveal that the source is slightly elongated , suggesting that apm 08279 + 5255  consists of a pair of sub ",
    "components separated by @xmath14 , consistent with the merger  driven hypothesis but also with the action of gravitational lensing . in several extreme ulirgs the morphology of the sub ",
    "components directly reveals the action of gravitational lensing , the magnification effect of which can significantly enhance the intrinsic properties of a system ; this is the case in both h1413 + 117 ( the `` cloverleaf quasar '' @xcite ) and the hyperluminous galaxy iras f10214 + 4724 ( @xcite ) , where the lensing - induced amplification is estimated to be @xmath15 . as apm 08279 + 5255",
    "is apparently so extremely luminous , the possibility that gravitational lensing is influencing the observed properties is highly likely .    given the cool temperature of the dust region , photometric and spectroscopic observations at submillimeter wavelengths have proved to be an important probe of ulirg systems , revealing details of the physical properties and processes underway in these energetic objects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper , we present new submillimeter photometry of apm 08279 + 5255 , from which an estimate of the total mass of dust , and its temperature , are derived . combining these data with previous observations , we compare the total spectral energy distribution to popular models of ulirg galaxies , while taking into account the potential effects that gravitational lensing may be playing in distorting our view of this system .",
    "the observations were conducted with the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba , @xcite ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope  .",
    "scuba contains a number of detectors and detector arrays cooled to 0.1@xmath7  that cover the atmospheric windows from 350  to 2000 . for our photometric observations",
    ", we operated the 91 element short - wave ( sw ) array at 450 , the 37 element long - wave ( lw ) array at 850 , and the single photometry pixel at 1350 , giving half - power beam widths of 7.5 , 14.7 , and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "a 9-point jiggle pattern was employed to reduce the impact of pointing errors .",
    "the source was centered on the central pixel of the arrays with the outer pixels being used for subtraction of the sky variations . whilst jiggling ,",
    "the secondary was chopped at 7.8125hz by @xmath17 in azimuth .",
    "the pointing stability was checked every hour and regular skydips were performed to measure the atmospheric opacity .",
    "the rms pointing errors were below @xmath18 .",
    "the observations were conducted over 3 nights in april , 1998 .",
    "the first night had stable atmospheric zenith opacities at 450  and 850 , with @xmath19 being 1.47 and 0.29 , but extremely high winds which forced dome closure .",
    "firm detections were obtained at both wavelengths .",
    "sky conditions were reasonably good on the second night and observations at both 850/450(@xmath20 ) and 1350  were carried out . on the third night conditions",
    "were less favorable ( cso @xmath19 around 0.1 and variable ) and only 1350observations were done  .    on the first and second nights both crl618 and irc10216 were observed as calibrators , while only irc10216 was observed on the third night .",
    "the latter is variable on a timescale of two years , and all observations were referenced to crl618 , which has well - determined flux densities with scuba at 850   and 450 , but nothing yet published for scuba at 1350 . in the latter case , the crl618 flux density published by sandell ( 1994 ) was used , and resulted in a sensible value for irc10216 .",
    "the values derived for irc10216 at 450/850  from crl618 were also well within the quoted errors .",
    "the dedicated scuba data reduction software ( surf , @xcite ) was used to reduce the observations .",
    "all non - noisy bolometers beyond @xmath21 of the central pixel were used to compensate for spatially - correlated sky emission in the 850/450arrays .",
    "the 1350   pixel currently has no provision for subtracting sky variations using the other wavelength pixels .",
    "the results of these observations , as well as variance - weighted mean values , are listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "the submillimeter photometry presented in table  [ table1 ] is combined with previous data ( irwin 1998 ) in figure  [ fig1 ] , which shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "the new data reveals that , in the submillimeter regime , the sed possesses a slope of @xmath22 , consistent with rayleigh - jeans blackbody emission .",
    "the curves superimposed on figure  [ fig1 ] show pure blackbody spectra of a source of temperature t=120@xmath7(dot - dash line ) and t=220@xmath7(dotted line ) ; such temperatures are representative of the temperature range of the regions of the source that emit in the submillimeter / far infrared region of the sed .",
    "these values are slightly higher than those determined for the far  infrared emission in other ulirg systems , which are typically t@xmath23100@xmath7  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the implied radius of such a blackbody is @xmath24pc ( assuming the emission region is spherical ) , a factor of 2 smaller than the cooler ( 80@xmath7 ) region responsible for the emission in iras f10214 + 4724  ( @xcite ) .    as outlined in  @xcite , observations in the submillimeter can be used to determine the mass in dust of ulirgs ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "typically , the dust emission in these systems appears to be optically thin , as is inferred from their steep sed slope ( the blackbody spectrum is modified by a dust absorption coefficient , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 ; in the rayleigh - jeans regime , this is apparent as a steepening of the slope to at least 4 in @xmath27 ) .",
    "the sed of apm 08279 + 5255  does not show such a steep slope , it is instead consistent with emission from an optically thick blackbody .",
    "the dust mass obtained from the application of the optically thin treatment can , therefore , be treated as a lower bound on the total dust mass in the system .",
    "assuming that the dust has a temperature of 220@xmath7 , the resulting dust mass from the three submillimeter data points presented here is @xmath28 [ assuming a constant dust absorption coefficient of @xmath29 = 0.1 @xmath30 ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "if gravitational lensing plays a role , this value could be over  estimated by a factor of @xmath31 , although it does indicate that apm 08279 + 5255   possesses copious amounts of dust , equivalent to that inferred for iras f10214 + 4724 ( @xcite ) , and in other ulirgs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the complex form of the sed in ulirgs suggests that a single temperature blackbody source for the fir flux represents a gross simplification of the underlying processes , and several multi - component models have been developed to better model these systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "these models generally consider a powerful source of continuum radiation embedded in an thick distribution of dust possessing grains of varying composition ( @xcite ) .",
    "radiative transfer techniques are then employed to calculate the reprocessing and re - emission of the central continuum radiation .",
    "three such models are superimposed on the submillimeter - optical region of the sed in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the dot - dashed curve represents the `` embedded quasar model '' of  @xcite ( their model c ) ; this possesses a power - law continuum source at the center of a spherically - symmetric dust distribution . as the dust obscures a direct view of the illuminating source ,",
    "all observed emission has been reprocessed .",
    "this model spectrum is normalized to the submillimeter data points presented here .",
    "such a `` pure dust emission '' spectrum provides a poor fit to apm 08279 + 5255   and other ultraluminous systems , severely underestimating the optical flux .",
    "spherical models with a lower optical depth allow some continuum flux through the dust region , but such models can not account for the far infrared / submillimeter flux ( @xcite ) .",
    "a natural extension to such a model is to remove the assumption of spherical symmetry and consider instead an axisymmetric distribution of absorbing dust , representing a torus about the nuclear region ( @xcite ) .",
    "as well as scaling with total luminosity , the emergent spectrum is also then a function of orientation with respect to the observer ; when viewing a system from the equatorial plane the dusty torus obscures the view of the continuum source and the sed is dominated by infrared dust emission .",
    "when viewing from the pole , however , an observer can look directly onto the central continuum source and the sed can possess both significant infrared and optical components .",
    "such a model was recently applied to several of extreme ultraluminous systems and , considering only orientation and total luminosity , was found to reproduce the gross characteristics of the observed seds ( @xcite ) .",
    "the solid line in figure  [ fig2 ] of this model , as viewed from the pole , while the dotted line is an equatorial view . also plotted are the rest frame seds for the ultraluminous cloverleaf quasar , h1413 + 117 ( filled triangles ) , and iras fsc 10214 + 4752 ( crosses ) , both normalized to the submillimeter observations of apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "while adequately describing these spectra , it is apparent that the models of granato et al .",
    "underestimates the infrared to optical flux by a factor of @xmath32 even at the extreme polar viewing orientation , and provide a poor fit of the sed of apm 08279 + 5255 . extrapolating this model to the data presented in this system ,",
    "the implied dust mass is @xmath33 , but again likely underestimates the true mass of dust in this system and is dependent on the degree of gravitational lensing .",
    "the degree to which the flux from a source is enhanced by the action of gravitational lensing is dependent on the scale - size of the source , leading to pronounced differential magnification effects ( @xcite ) ; in iras f10214 + 4724 the optical emission is thought to be magnified by a factor of @xmath34 , while the flux from the more extended far  infrared region undergoes a magnification of @xmath31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if gravitational lensing influences apm 08279 + 5255 , can such effects account for the discrepancy between these models and the observed sed ? in `` typical '' quasars , the optical - to - infrared continuum ratios are seen ( in @xmath35 ) to be @xmath36 ( @xcite ) .",
    "all this emission arises in the central accretion disk whose scale is similar for both emission regimes ; gravitational lensing would uniformly magnify such a source , simply scaling its contribution to the total spectrum .",
    "normalizing the ( magnified ) quasar sed to the observed r - band magnitude it can be seen that the quasar continuum source , even if highly magnified in this system , can contribute little to the submillimeter - infrared sed .",
    "it should be noted , however , that if the quasar continuum source does , intrinsically , possess significant emission into the far  infrared , differential magnification effects may reconcile the data with the current models .",
    "this paper has presented new submillimeter observations of the ultraluminous bal quasar apm 08279 + 5255 ; the data are consistent with emission from a warm ( 120@xmath7 - 220@xmath7 ) , massive , optically thick distribution of dust which is heated by a quasar central continuum source .",
    "a simple model for the emission region of ulirgs , consisting of a agn  like continuum embedded within a spherical distribution fails , when normalized to the submillimeter data , to reproduce the observed sed , underestimating the the flux in the infrared and , due to a highly obscured view onto the quasar source , predicts no optical flux .",
    "axisymmetric models , where the dust is distributed in a torus , do allow relatively unobscured views of the quasar core , allowing unprocessed optical flux to escape . even at the most extreme viewing angles , however , current models still underestimate both the infrared and optical flux by several factors .",
    "further modeling of the geometry and physics of the emission region in apm 08279 + 5255 , coupled with the effects of possible differential magnification due to gravitational lensing , is therefore required .",
    "such modeling will provide a more accurate determination of the dust mass in apm 08279 + 5255 , which , when coupled with spectroscopic observations of warm molecular gas tracers such as co , will shed light on the interaction between star ",
    "formation , warm dust and the agn core in explaining the observed properties of this phenomenal system .",
    "it is interesting to note that pronounced infrared emission has been observed in a number of seyfert is and iis in the nearby universe .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "similar to the high redshift ulirgs , the source of this emission is thought to be a warm , dusty torus , with viewing - angle dependent obscuration of the continuum source and broad emission line region accounting for the difference between the seyfert classes .",
    "the similarity between this model and that proposed for more distant and powerful ulirgs ( @xcite ) , especially considering that several seyfert i systems exhibit absorption features indicating the presence of high - velocity outflows [ e.g. markarian 231 ( @xcite ) ] , suggests that , rather than being unique objects displaying unusual properties , systems such as apm 08279 + 5255  and h1413 + 117 appear to be simply more luminous members of the ulirg / agn family .",
    "we thank henry matthews of the jcmt for the acquisition and reduction of the canserv sub  millimeter data , and paul feldman and russell redman for details of the canserv application .",
    "the anonymous referee and zdenka kuncic are thanked for useful comments .",
