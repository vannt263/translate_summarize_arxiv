    "in the context of image analysis and image processing a variety of generative models for digitalized picture arrays in the two dimensional plane have been proposed @xcite . out of the different techniques adopted for various models ,",
    "grammar based techniques utilize the rich theory of formal grammars and languages and develop array grammars generating two dimensional languages whose elements are picture arrays .",
    "there are two distinct types of array grammars , isometric array grammars and non - isometric array grammars .",
    "since application of rewriting rule can increase or decrease the length of the rewritten part , the dimension of rewritten sub array can change in the case of non - isometric grammars but application of such a rule is shape preserving in the case of isometric grammars due to the fact that the left and right sides of an array rewriting rule is geometrically identical .    in order to handle more context with rewriting systems , a system with several components",
    "is composed and defined a cooperation protocol for these components to generate a common sentential form .",
    "such devices are known as cooperating distributed ( cd)grammar systems @xcite .",
    "components are represented by grammars or other rewriting devices , and the protocol for mutual cooperation modifying the common sentential form according to their own rules . a variety of string grammar system models @xcite have been introduced and studied in the literature .",

    "p@xmath0un elaborated the power of cooperation in array grammar system ( cooperating array grammar system ) for various non - context - free sets of arrays which can be generated in a simple way by cooperating array grammar systems and simple picture description @xcite .",
    "they also proved that the cooperation increases the generative capacity even in the case of systems with regular array grammar components .",
    "different kinds of control mechanism that are added to component grammars for regulated rewriting rules have been considered in string grammar systems and such control devices are known to increase the generative power of the grammar in many cases @xcite .",

    "this feature of associating permitting symbols with rules when extended to patterns in the form of connected arrays also requires checking of symbols , but this is simpler than usual pattern matching .",

    "since @xmath122 is the permuting symbol for rule ( 3 ) , rule ( 3 ) can then applied which results the growth of @xmath4 arm by one place .",

    "the equality follows from the results from @xcite .",
    "we know that , a @xmath127 with empty set of permitting symbols associated with the rules is same as a cooperating distributed @xmath128 hexagonal array grammar system and so @xmath151 if @xmath90 .",
    "examples ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) illustrated the fact that the set @xmath119 of all hexagonal arrays over @xmath152 in the shape of left arrow head with left upper arm and left lower arm with equal size is generated by the @xmath153 with only one component and working in the @xmath103-mode and hence the inclusion is proper which proves ( 1 ) .",
    "similar arguments for inclusion in statement(2 ) are hold . from the proof of the lemma(1 ) it is very clear that under the strict application of the derivation rules with the respective permitive symbols generate a hollow hexagon with parallel arms equal in size . such a generation is not possible in @xmath154 since @xmath155 and incorrect application of terminating rule will leads to non - completion of the hollow hexagon with parallel arms equal in size .",
    "thus @xmath156    consider the array languages generated by @xmath127 in example ( 1 ) and in the proof of lemma ( 1 ) .",
    "it can be seen that generating the arrow head of patterns of the language , we should require two growing heads at the same time .",
    "but in the @xmath157 with any number of components the array rules contains only one growing head .",
    "so the same language can not be generated by @xmath158 and this proves ( 3 ) .    to show the power of the cooperating hexagonal array grammar system with the array rules controlled by permitting symbols , consider the following example of a language of set of all hexagons with parallel arms are equal in length over a one letter alphabet .",
    "starting with @xmath168 repeated application of the first five rules of the component @xmath136 in this order generate @xmath169 having equal arms , with @xmath3 arm having non - terminal @xmath123 and @xmath4 arm having non - terminal @xmath170 once two rules @xmath171 and @xmath172 of component @xmath136 are used , the generations of these two arms end with terminal @xmath173 and then starts the generations of upper and lower arms of the hexagon using rules ( 6 ) to ( 11 ) .",
    "then the right application of rule ( 12 ) to ( 17 ) then ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) , @xmath174 ( 45 ) subjected to the permitting symbols will result to a hexagonal picture and finally by the application of rules in @xmath175 we get the required hexagon over the one letter alphabet @xmath115 as in figure 5 .    in the siromoney matrix grammar ( 9 )",
    "rectangular arrays are generated in two phases ; one in horizontal and the other in vertical .",
    "further it was extended by associating a finite set of rules in the second phase of generation with each table having either right linear non - terminal rules of the form @xmath176 or right - linear terminal rules of the form @xmath177 and such array languages are denoted by @xmath178 and @xmath179 and we have a well known result @xmath180 ( refer 11 ) .",
    "correspondingly it can be established for hexagonal arrays .",
    "here we compare @xmath127 with these classes .            except the rules @xmath186 in @xmath117",
    "generates the @xmath3 and @xmath4 arm with a middle marker @xmath10 and the symbols @xmath187 above and below @xmath10 in both arms and which are equal in number .",
    "the first two rules of @xmath144 changes the symbols in the left most cell in to @xmath173.then the remaining rules of @xmath144 and the last two rules of @xmath117 ( @xmath188,@xmath189 ) and the rules of the component @xmath190 generate the arms such that each cell in the middle arm in the horizontal direction is made up of @xmath191 and all other cells above and below are made up of @xmath192 except the leftmost arms.the generation of the cells finally terminates , yielding the rightmost cells are rewritten by @xmath191 .",
    "thus a hexagonal array in the shape of a left arrowhead ( describing as figure(6 ) is generated).if we treat @xmath193 as blank , such arrays can not be in @xmath179 and which in turn proves that @xmath194 .",
