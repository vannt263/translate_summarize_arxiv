    "subject of this work is a study of the dynamics of a continuous chain which is subjected to thermodynamic fluctuations at constant temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the chain is represented as the limit of a system of beads and links of fixed length , in which the number @xmath1 of beads becomes infinite , while the length @xmath2 of the links goes to zero in such a way that the total length of the chain @xmath3 remains a finite constant .",
    "problems of this kind are encountered for example in polymer physics , because with some approximation long flexible polymers may be regarded as continuous chains @xcite .",
    "it is thus spontaneous to consider an isolated polymer fluctuating in some viscous environment as a concrete realization of the system investigated here . a few applications in which the dynamics of a chain turns out to be relevant are mentioned in ref .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite six regimes of the chain dynamics are distinguished , which apply not only to the well known case of a polymer in a solution , but also to other cases , like for instance those of an isolated cold chain and of a hot polymer in the vapor phase .    from polymer physics",
    ", one may borrow the standard approach to the dynamics of a chain .",
    "it consists in considering the fluctuations of the chain as a stochastic process , which is usually described with the help of the langevin equations or , alternatively , of the fokker  planck ",
    "smoluchowski equations @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to the well known models of rouse @xcite and zimm @xcite which allow a satisfactory understanding of the main properties of polymers in solutions .",
    "one major drawback of these coarse grained models is that they do not take into account the rigid constraints which are necessary in order to keep constant the length of the links connecting the beads .",
    "the rouse and rouse  zimm equation consider instead beads joined together by springs , where the local spring is infinitely extensible . in this way",
    "the length of the chain is not fixed and is allowed to become infinite . moreover , in the continuous limit the rouse equation is nothing but the stochastic equation ( langevin equation ) for the classical wiener measure , which yields paths without well defined tangent vectors @xcite .",
    "these problems have been tackled by various attempts , see e.g. @xcite",
    ". however , the correct use of rigid constraints in ( stochastic ) dynamics requires some mathematical effort @xcite , in contrast to the static cases where rigid constraints can be implemented by dirac delta functions in the partition functions .",
    "for instance , the probability distribution of @xmath1 ideal closed chains topologically linked together may be represented as a path integral of @xmath1 noninteracting particles with the insertion of dirac delta functions which enforce the topological constraints on their trajectories @xcite .    here",
    "a strategy similar to that used for static chains will be applied to dynamics .",
    "we consider the distribution @xmath4 of the probability that a fluctuating chain passes from a initial discrete spatial conformation @xmath5 to a final one @xmath6 in a given interval of time @xmath7 .",
    "the idea behind our approach is based on the fact that the beads of the chain may be regarded as a set of @xmath1 brownian particles with constrained trajectories .",
    "the constraints arise due to the presence of the @xmath8 links of fixed lengths connecting the beads . as a consequence , it is possible to write the probability distribution @xmath4 in the form of a path integral describing the fluctuations of @xmath1 brownian particles with the insertion of dirac delta functions .",
    "the latter are needed in order to impose the necessary conditions on the trajectories of the particles . for simplicity , possible interactions among the beads",
    "have been switched off , including hydrodynamic interactions and only the two - dimensional case has been discussed .",
    "the limit in which the chain becomes continuous is not entirely trivial .",
    "it involves the vanishing of three crucial quantities , the mass of the beads , their mobility and their size . after performing this limit very carefully ,",
    "we obtain as a final result the probability distribution @xmath9 of the continuous chain .",
    "it is found that @xmath9 consists of a path integral which closely resembles the partition function of a two - dimensional nonlinear sigma model  @xcite .",
    "for this reason the obtained model will be called the generalized nonlinear sigma model ( gnlsm ) .",
    "the main difference from the nonlinear sigma model is that the holonomic constraint is replaced in the gnlsm by an nonholonomic constraint , which requires that the tangent at every point of the trajectory of the chain is an unit vector .",
    "the lagrange multiplier that imposes this nonholonomic constraint plays the same role of pressure in the hydrodynamics of incompressible fluids , a fact already noted in ref .",
    "the `` incompressibility '' is related to the fact that it is not possible to `` compress '' the lengths of the links joining the beads .",
    "the gnlsm is well suited to study all situations in which it is possible to assume that the thermodynamic fluctuations and the conformational changes are small and slow .",
    "systems satisfying these requirements are for instance cold chains or chains in a very viscous medium .    in principle , the gnlsm is exactly solvable after performing two gaussian integrations , but the presence of non - trivial boundary conditions complicates the calculation of the probability distribution @xmath9 .",
    "even the method of the effective potential , which is useful to investigate phase transitions in nonlinear sigma models , can not be easily applied . as a matter of fact , in the nonlinear sigma model the effective potential",
    "is computed assuming that the field configurations which minimize the action are constants .",
    "however , in the gnlsm configurations of this kind correspond to the situation in which the chain has collapsed to a point and are thus unphysical . despite these difficulties , it is possible to compute the probability distribution @xmath9 and the associated generating functional of the correlation functions of the bond vectors @xmath10 $ ] using a background field approximation , in which small gaussian fluctuations are considered in the background of a dominating classical conformation .",
    "the initial and final conformations of the chain are picked up by choosing in a suitable way the background classical solution and by tuning the boundary conditions of the gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the semiclassical approximation is valid in the case of low temperatures or of highly viscous media , exactly the regimes in which the gnlsm can be applied .",
    "the explicit formulas of @xmath9 and @xmath10 $ ] derived here show that the fluctuations which deform the chain along directions which are tangent to the trajectory of the classical background conformation propagate differently from the normal fluctuations .",
    "this fact is a direct consequence of the presence of rigid constraints and could be relevant for example in the theory of formation of single polymer crystals @xcite .",
    "the material presented in this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii the form of the lagrangian of a classical discrete chain in two dimensions has been derived in polar and in cartesian coordinates .",
    "no restrictions are posed to the motion of the discrete chain .",
    "the limit to a continuous chain is however performed assuming that one of the ends of the chain is fixed .",
    "the calculation in polar coordinates shows that one crucial term in the lagrangian disappears in the continuous limit .",
    "this fact simplifies the classical equations of motion of the chain .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath9 of the fluctuating chain is computed in section iii using a path integral approach .",
    "some subtleties arising when taking the continuous limit in the probability distribution of the discrete chain are discussed .",
    "section iv is dedicated to the study of the classical solutions of the gnlsm .",
    "it is shown that the only possible classical solutions are time independent , apart from rigid translations with constant velocity of the whole chain .",
    "the computation of the probability distribution @xmath9 and of the generating functional @xmath10 $ ] for a ring - shaped chain is performed in the semiclassical approximation in section v. the physical interpretation of the results obtained in the previous sections is presented in section vi .",
    "the equilibrium limit of the gnlsm and its connection with the rouse model are studied in section vii . finally , in section viii the conclusions are drawn and possible future developments are discussed .",
    "let us consider a discrete chain of @xmath8 segments of fixed lengths @xmath11 in the two - dimensional plane .",
    "each segment @xmath12 is completely specified by the positions of its end points @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in cartesian coordinates @xmath15 these positions are given by the radius vectors : @xmath16 the segments are joined together at the points @xmath14 , where @xmath17 , see fig .",
    "[ system2y ] , while @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the ends of the chain .",
    "moreover , at each point @xmath14 , with @xmath20 , a mass @xmath21 is attached . in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of a free chain .",
    "we will see below that the addition of interactions is straightforward .    at this point",
    "we compute the kinetic energy of the above system : @xmath22 the subscript @xmath23 in the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ totenechadef ] ) is to recall that we are considering at the moment a discrete chain with @xmath8 segments . for future purposes",

    "( [ totenechadef ] ) one should also add the constraints @xmath25 in order to enforce the requirement that the segments have fixed length @xmath26 .",
    "it is possible to eliminate these constraints passing to polar coordinates : @xmath27 @xmath28 is the angle formed by segment @xmath29 with the @xmath30axis , see fig .",
    "[ system2y ] . according to our settings ,",
    "the radial coordinates @xmath31 are constants for @xmath32 .",
    "the length @xmath33 , which denotes the distance of the end point @xmath34 from the origin , is not fixed , so that @xmath35 is allowed to vary with the time @xmath36 . from eq .",
    "( [ carpol2 ] ) the velocity components of the @xmath37th segment may be written as follows : @xmath38     segments .",

    "if we do that , at the end the total kinetic energy of the discrete chain becomes : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the total mass of the chain .",

    "reasonable assumptions are : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are respectively the distribution of length and of mass along the chain . to be consistent with our settings , the distributions @xmath60 and @xmath61 must be normalized as follows : @xmath62    while it would be interesting to study chains in which the segments are allowed to have different lengths and the points have different masses , for simplicity we will suppose from now on that the length and mass distributions in the chains are uniform , i. e. : @xmath63 in the discrete case ( compare with eq .",

    "( [ postnpi ] ) a product of dirac @xmath115functions which enforce exactly these constraints : @xmath116 in the above equation @xmath117 denotes a normalization constant .",
    "moreover , we have introduced the functional @xmath118 defined as follows : @xmath119 the distribution @xmath4 measures the probability that a chain starting from the initial configuration @xmath120 of its segments ends up after a time @xmath121 in the configuration @xmath122 .",
    "we note that the diffusion constant @xmath110 appearing in ( [ actiondisc ] ) satisfies the relation : @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the mobility of the particle , @xmath125 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath0 is the temperature .",
