    "dark matter models have been explored using lhc data , such as in  @xcite .",
    "this search is mainly based on the dark matter missing energy plus the observed final states from the higgs decay products . in lep",
    "/ ilc , the physical strategy is similar : the annihilation of particles , in this case an electron and a positron , into a pair of dark matter candidates , which are invisible  @xcite .",
    "however , this production can be followed also by a photon that can be detected . in lep , an excess of events related with dark matter plus",
    "mono - photon production has not been found beyond the expected background , and limits to such an interaction were placed instead  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous analyses , we include in our work a dark matter model which takes into account different couplings with right- and left - handed fermions .    despite the aforementioned experimental efforts ,",
    "wimp dark matter remains a hypothesis and its existence is still an ongoing search at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the mass scale of a wimp dark matter is of the order of 100  gev .",
    "however , authors in ref .",

    "it might be produced in the annihilation of electrons and positrons in the leptonic colliders cited above : lep and the future ilc .",
    "the scalar dark matter model under consideration has four main parameters : _ i _ ) one for the coupling with left chirality leptons , ( _ ii _ ) one for the coupling with right chirality leptons , ( _ iii _ ) the dark matter mass , and ( _ iv _ ) the mass of a heavy intermediate fermion .",
    "we find the constraints in the coupling constants for different intermediate fermion masses .",
    "there is no sensitivity to the dark matter mass because the collision energy is much higher than the dark matter mass itself .",

    "@xcite obtained the strongest bound on the scattering cross section between dark matter and electrons at a 100  mev dark matter mass .",
