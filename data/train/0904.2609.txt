    "a recent breakthrough in quantum computing has been the realization that quantum computation can proceed solely through single - qubit measurements on an appropriate quantum state  @xcite .",
    "the canonical example of such a resource state is the cluster state  @xcite , which is a universal resource for mbqc on suitable lattices or graphs  @xcite .",
    "a handful of other universal resources for mbqc have recently been identified  @xcite , but it is still not known what properties of a quantum many - body system allow for mbqc to proceed .    in recent work  @xcite",
    ", we have proposed that the ability to perform mbqc on a quantum many - body system may be identified using appropriate correlation functions as order parameters .",
    "this claim stems from the observation that mbqc is a means of preparing resource states for gate teleportation  @xcite . with a cluster state",
    ", it is possible by local measurements and feedforward alone to prepare such resource states allowing gate teleportation for a universal set of gates between essentially any set of qubits in the lattice .",
    "the performance of mbqc can be determined by calculating the fidelity between the resource state that is actually prepared and the ideal resource state . here",
    ", we demonstrate how to express the resource state _",
    "after _ the measurements in terms of correlation functions of the original state _ prior _ to the measurements .",
    "these results provide an alternate perspective to theorem 1 in  @xcite , which shows that the gates in the cluster state mbqc scheme function because of certain correlations in the original cluster state .",
    "in particular , our results apply to characterize gate performance in quantum states that are _ not _ the cluster state ; with such correlation functions , it is possible to directly quantify the suitability of a given quantum many - body state for performing such mbqc gates .",
    "we note that our work has a close relation to the concept of localizable entanglement  @xcite . for the state of a quantum many - body system",
    ", the localizable entanglement between two arbitrary qubits is defined as the maximum amount of entanglement that can be created between these two qubits by performing local measurements on the remaining qubits .",
    "if this entangled state is viewed as a resource for quantum teleportation , then the localizable entanglement serves to quantify the ability to perform the trivial or ` identity ' gate ( i.e. , teleportation ) using local measurements .",
    "we note that the localizable entanglement in some systems can be quantified by correlation functions  @xcite , using similar techniques as described here .",
    "our work generalizes these results by considering non - trivial quantum gates , which include multi - qubit quantum gates .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : background ] , we review some of the essential terminology and mathematical structure of cluster - state quantum computing .",
    "[ sec : general ] presents the key general results of the paper , relating mbqc quantum gates to correlation functions .",

    "the pauli matrices are labeled @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath1 and are defined as @xmath4 the group generated by the pauli matrices under matrix multiplication is known as the pauli group @xmath5 .",
    "the pauli group @xmath6 on @xmath7-qubits is defined as @xmath8 .",
    "the clifford group on @xmath7 qubits is defined to be the group of unitary operators that map the pauli group onto itself ; i.e. , @xmath9 is in the clifford group if @xmath10 for all @xmath11 .      the stabilizer formalism is a method of describing a state of a quantum system by specifying a set of eigenvalue relations instead of its components in some basis .",
    "the eigenvalues of a complete set of commuting observables completely specifies a state .",
    "we define the _ stabilizers _ of a quantum state to be the set of operators for which the state is a @xmath12 eigenstate .",
    "clearly , any two stabilizers must commute , and thus the set of stabilizers forms an abelian group .",
    "this group can be specified by its generators , and homomorphisms on the group can be specified completely by their effect on the generators . as a result",
    "it is sufficient to study the generators , a subset of the group , instead of the whole group .",
    "for example , the state @xmath13 can be described as the state which is stabilized by the operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; the stabilizer group of this state is generated by these two stabilizer operators .",
    "the stabilizer formalism was first used to describe quantum error correction codes @xcite , but are widely applicable to a variety of other situations .",
    "the standard stabilizer formalism is defined to only allow elements of the pauli group @xmath6 to be used as stabilizers .",
    "a set of pauli stabilizers satisfies some key properties :    * elements of @xmath6 either commute or anti - commute . *",
    "if @xmath16 and @xmath17 anticommutes with both @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then @xmath17 commutes with @xmath20 .",
    "the power of the stabilizer formalism lies in its ability to compactly describe certain quantum states , as well as their evolution under clifford group operations and pauli measurements .",
    "first , an arbitrary @xmath7-qubit state requires @xmath21 complex numbers to completely describe , by specifying the contribution from each of the @xmath21 basis vectors of the @xmath7-qubit system . for systems which are stabilized by the pauli group ,",
    "a set of @xmath7 stabilizers is sufficient to describe an @xmath7-qubit stabilizer state @xcite , i.e. , @xmath7 stabilizers can form a complete set of commuting observables . hence if applicable , the stabilizer formalism offers a compact way of denoting states of a quantum system .",
    "second , the stabilizer formalism is very efficient in describing a state under the evolution of unitary operators belonging to the clifford group , the group of operators which map the pauli group back to itself under conjugation .",
    "it is also efficient for describing the evolution of a state of a multi - qubit system under a projective measurement in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath1 basis . a simple prescription exists which tells us how to obtain the stabilizers of the post - evolution / measurement state from the pre - evolution / measurement state  @xcite .",
    "the cluster state is a many - qubit entangled state  @xcite .",
    "consider an arbitrary graph with a qubit at each vertex ; the cluster state on this graph is characterized by the stabilizers @xmath22 for each qubit @xmath23 of the state , where @xmath24 is the set of qubits adjacent to @xmath23 ( via the graph structure ) .",
    "in other words , the cluster state @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 for all @xmath23 .",
    "two examples of cluster states on graphs will be considered here : a one - dimensional line , for which the stabilizers take the form @xmath27 , and a two - dimensional square lattice , for which the stabilizers take the form @xmath28 .",
    "consider a one - dimensional lattice of qubits prepared in the state @xmath29 . singling out two qubits , @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we wish to consider a measurement sequence on the remaining qubits in the lattice that yields a two - qubit resource state on qubits @xmath30 and @xmath31 for gate teleportation .",
    "let @xmath32 label the measurement outcomes , and @xmath33 be the corresponding projector .",
    "following the measurements , a unitary @xmath34 conditional on @xmath32 is applied to qubit @xmath31 .",
    "averaged over all possible measurement outcomes , the resulting resource state is @xmath35 equivalently , we can characterize this resource state using expectation values of bipartite pauli operators @xmath36 on qubits @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as @xmath37    =   { \\textstyle \\sum_j } { \\rm tr } [ ( ab_j)p_j \\rho_0 p_j   ] \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 . the set of such correlation functions , for @xmath39 spanning the set of pauli operators , will completely specify the bi - partite resource state .    for each of the mbqc gates given in  @xcite , we can make use of a remarkable relation : there exists a string of operators @xmath40 acting on some set of the measured qubits which is _ independent _ of the measurement outcomes , and an operator @xmath41 on @xmath31 that is also independent of @xmath32 , such that @xmath42 now , using the projector properties @xmath43 and @xmath44 gives @xmath45\\,.\\ ] ] thus we can relate the resource state prepared _",
    "after _ the sequence of measurements to a correlation function of the original state @xmath29 _ prior _ to measurements .",
    "that is , the correlation functions characterize the _ _ post-__measurement resource state using expectation values of strings of operators on the _ _ pre-__measurement state .",
    "this argument is trivially extendible to multi - qubit gates .",
    "it is critical to this development that one can identify such a string of operators @xmath40 . in the examples",
    "presented , the correction operator is a pauli operator , and essentially it is the simple algebraic properties of the pauli operators which are responsible for the existence of @xmath40 .",
    "that the corrections are always pauli operators makes the analysis of the clifford gates especially simple , and we find that @xmath40 for such operators takes the form of a product of pauli operators . even for our non - clifford gate , we can still identify an appropriate operator ( this time , a sum of product of pauli operators ) .",
    "we will consider performing an identity gate between two qubits in a line with an odd number of qubits between , qubit @xmath46 and qubit @xmath47 . to perform this gate one measures",
    "@xmath2 on each of the @xmath48 qubits between these two , and measures @xmath1 on qubit @xmath49 and the qubit @xmath50 .",
    "we label measurement outcomes by the eigenvalues of the measured operators , which for pauli operators are either @xmath12 or @xmath51 . specifically , we label the measurement outcome for the @xmath2 measurement on the qubit @xmath52 by @xmath53 , and the outcome for the @xmath1 measurement on the qubit @xmath49 ( @xmath54 ) by @xmath55 ( @xmath56 )",

    "the unitaries only act on the @xmath18 space ( qubit @xmath47 ) so operators that act only on the @xmath17 space are unchanged on commuting through the projectors and do not depend on the measurement outcome . for the @xmath18 operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we need to absorb the factors of @xmath61 that arise from the correction unitary by adding factors of the measured observables . if we perform an @xmath2 measurement for example then @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the projector on the @xmath64 eigenstate .",
    "we have @xmath65 and therefore we have the relations @xmath66    at this stage , we note that the correlation functions we would expect for an ideal identity gate are @xmath67 . using eq .  , we find @xmath68 = { \\rm tr } \\bigl[\\bigl(\\prod_{j=0}^{j",

    "as these correlations are equivalent to expectation values of cluster stabilizers , if @xmath29 is the cluster state these expectation values will both be unity .",
    "other expectation values , for example local expectation values @xmath70 or @xmath71 , or those involving any other pauli operator combination , can also be explicitly determined .",
    "the set of all such correlation functions will completely characterize the resource state .",
    "we now turn our attention to other single - qubit gates . rather than directly consider correlation functions over arbitrary lengths , we restrict our attention to a fixed length ( specifically , 3 intermediate qubits ) between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in section  [ sec : concatenate ] , we will show how to concatenate such fixed - length gates together ( possibly with the identity gate ) to form gates of arbitrary lengths .",
