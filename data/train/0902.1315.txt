    "it is generally agreed that the orbital plane lies in the equatorial plane of the bipolar structure@xmath1the homunculus , such that the inclination angle ( the angle between a line perpendicular to the orbital plane and the line of sight ) is @xmath5 ( davidson et al . 2001 ; smith 2002 ) .",
    "however , there is a disagreement about the orientation of the semimajor axis in the orbital plane@xmath1the periastron longitude .",
    "we will use the commonly used periastron longitude angle @xmath6 : @xmath7 for a case when the secondary is toward the observer at an orbital angle of @xmath8 before periastron , and so on , as summarized in equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) , @xmath9    while some groups argue that the secondary ( less massive ) star is away from us during periastron passages , @xmath10 ( e.g. , nielsen et al . 2007 ; damineli et al .",

    "( 3 ) the ionization of surrounding gas blobs by the radiation of the hotter secondary star .",
    "ks08 found that all of these support an orientation where for most of the time the secondary@xmath1the hotter less massive star@xmath1is behind the primary star ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the secondary comes closer to the observer only for a short time near periastron passage .    in a more recent paper ,",
    "parkin et al . ( 2009 , hereafter p09 ) built a model to fit the x - ray cyclical light curve in the @xmath13 band as observed by rxte ( corcoran 2005 ) . from their modelling",
    "they deduced that the secondary is away from us at , or somewhat after , periastron ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "this is an opposite orientation to that deduced by us in a previous paper ( ks08 ) . in the present paper",
    "we take the challenge to compare the contradicting conclusions of p09 and ks08 . for",
    "that we critically follow the arguments of p09 ( sections [ sec : xray ] and [ sec : collapse ] ) , and recheck and improve some of our previous calculations ( section [ sec : n_h ] ) .",
    "we find severe problems with many of their assumptions .",
    "we conclude that their model fails to account for the x - ray observations .",
    "we also introduce new calculations , and suggest that a polar outflow is responsible to some of the observed soft x - ray emission ( section [ sec : diss ] ) during the x - ray minimum .",
    "the hard x - ray emission observed in @xmath0 car is emitted by the shocked secondary wind ( corcoran et al .",
    "2001 ; pittard & corcoran 2002 ; akashi et al .",
    "2006 , hereafter a06 ) . for constant winds properties , the volume of the shocked secondary wind changes along the orbit as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the orbital separation .",
    "the time scale for the shocked gas to flow out of the emitting volume goes as @xmath16 , implying that the amount of gas in the volume goes as @xmath17 as well .",
    "therefore , the x - ray intrinsic emission goes as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the emissivity , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the electron and proton number densities , respectively .",
    "the @xmath22 variation is assumed by p09 .",
    "there are small variations to this dependance .",
    "a06 considered the relative motion of the two stars , through its influence on the ram pressures of the two winds .",
    "they found that before periastron the x - ray emission is larger than that given by equation ( [ eq : lxem ] ) , while after periastron it is lower .",
    "the relation @xmath22 is generic to x - ray emission from colliding fast winds . for @xmath0 car",
    "the eccentricity is very high , and the increase in the internal x - ray emission from apastron to periastron is by a factor of @xmath23 . any model , and any observer from what ever direction , would detect a sharp increase in the x - ray emission when the system is near periastron .",
    "the direction to the observer would change the observed flux because of the dependance of the column density of the absorbing gas on the direction .",
    "however , there are several unknown parameters of the binary system and the winds which can be adjusted to accommodate almost any orientation . for that",
    ", the x - ray light curve by itself can not be used to deduce the periastron longitude , or even the inclination angle .",
    "this was nicely shown by a06 , who could fit the x - ray light curve by using both an inclination of @xmath24 ( observer above the orbital plane ) and @xmath25 with @xmath26 , by slightly varying two parameters of the model that are related to the two winds ( no fine tuning was required ) .",
    "there is a very deep x - ray minimum lasting for @xmath27  week following periastron passage ( corcoran 2005 ) . in all models of the kind discussed here",
    "it is required to fit the x - ray emission during the @xmath27  week minimum by simply _ assuming _ this minimum .",
    "therefore , the behavior of the x - ray emission during the x - ray minimum , and a few days before and after , can not be used to discriminate between different orientations .",
    "p09 reject the @xmath28 semi - major orientation ( @xmath29 in their notation ) based only on the behavior during the x - ray minimum .",
    "they presented only the case @xmath30 with @xmath31 , rather than taking @xmath25 .",
    "they also examined our preferred case with @xmath32 , and found the resulted flux at phase @xmath33 to be @xmath34 times below the observed one ( parkin , r. , private communication 2009 ) .",
    "however , there are problems with their calculation .",
    "first , p09 assume the emission measure to increase as @xmath35 , where @xmath16 is the orbital separation .",
    "however , the increase in the emission measure is smaller .",
    "for example , at phase @xmath36 the orbital separation is @xmath37 times smaller than at apastron , but the emission measure is only @xmath38 times larger than the apastron value ( h07 ) . in addition , before periastron the two stars approach each other , an effect that increases the x - ray emission for constant wind properties , e.g. , by @xmath39 at phase @xmath33 ( a06 ) ; this effect was not considered by p09 .",
    "the conclusion is that the secondary wind starts being disturbed weeks before periastron , and the emission measure does not increase as much as assumed by p09 . to explain the observed flux , the column density can not increase by the large factor predicted by the @xmath40 periastron longitude .",
    "a shallower increase in the column density is reproduced by our preferred periastron longitude @xmath41 .",
    "we can summarize this section by stating that fitting the x - ray light curve with a simple model based on the intrinsic x - ray emission alone can not teach us much about the orientation .",
    "almost any inclination and periastron orientation can be fitted with some adjustment of the poorly known binary and wind parameters .",
    "in this section we discuss the hydrogen column density as deduced from x - ray observations by h07 .",
    "this section is based on the calculations of ks08 , but significant improvements are added .",
    "we start by describing the observations which we are later rely upon .",
    "the column density toward the hot gas was deduced by h07 using their xmm - newton observations .",
    "the binary system itself and its close surroundings are not resolved , but they are distinguished from the extended x - ray emission in the xmm - newton observations .",
    "the xmm - newton observations cover a very small fraction of the orbit .",
    "the rxte observations , on the other hand cover more than 2 orbits ( corcoran 2005 ) , but do not have the spatial resolution to separate the central source from the extended source . in any case ,",
    "most of the x - ray emission during most of the orbit result from the binary system .",
    "we shall focus our discussion on the hot @xmath42 component . at phase",
    "@xmath43 the column density toward this component is @xmath44 , as deduced by xmm - newton observations ( h07 ) .",
    "all the @xmath45 observations and their errors as stated by h07 appear in fig .",
    "[ fig : nh ] .",
    "though the compact object dominates the emission , the uncertainty can be somewhat larger due to combination of multiple spectral components in the data .",
    "our confidence in the column density values derived by h07 is based also on their finding that the column density has not varied between phases @xmath43 and @xmath46 .",
    "the binary parameters are as in our previous paper ( where references are given ) : the assumed stellar masses are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the eccentricity is @xmath49 , and the orbital period is @xmath50 .",
    "the stellar winds mass loss rates and terminal velocities are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for these parameters , the half opening angle of the winds collision region ( wcr ) near apastron is @xmath55 ( a06 ) . for the inclination angle",
    "we take @xmath56 .",
    "h07 modeled the variable x - ray emission with two components . a hot component that explains all the emission above @xmath57 , and an extra soft component that contributes to the emission below @xmath57 .",
    "near apastron the hot component has a temperature of @xmath58 , while the extra soft component has a temperature of @xmath59 . in ks08",
    "we have studied only the hot component because we know this region comes from the strongly shocked ( perpendicular shock ) secondary wind before it suffers any adiabatic cooling .",
    "therefore , we can safely estimate its location to be close to the stagnation point of the colliding winds ( apex ) , but somewhat closer to the secondary .",
    "the source and location of the @xmath60 gas , on the other hand , is less secure , but it probably resides in an extended region .",
    "the very important thing we do learn from h07 analysis of the x - ray emission by the @xmath60 gas is that the contribution of absorbing gas around the winds interaction region to the column density is @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that any column density of @xmath62 must come from material close to the binary system , at most @xmath63 .",
    "p09 tried to fit the rxte light curve of the emission in the @xmath13 band ( corcoran 2005 ) .",
    "the temperature of the extra soft component is @xmath64 , and its contribution to the @xmath13 band is expected to be small relative to that of the hot ( @xmath58 ) component ( e.g. , sarazin & bahcall 1977 ) .",
    "indeed , the hot component contributes @xmath65 of the observed x - ray emission in the @xmath13 band ( deduced from figures 8 and 9 of h07 ) .",
    "therefore , in fitting the column density based on the x - ray emission in the @xmath13 band , one better compare it to the column density toward to hot component of h07 ( their table 5 ) , rather to the entire spectrum of h07 ( the entire spectrum studied by h07 goes below @xmath66 ) . in any case",
    ", we shall stay with the hot component as it is better defined .",
    "the column density toward the hot gas at phase @xmath43 is @xmath67 .",
    "this is hard to explain in a model where the secondary is toward us during this phase , i.e. , @xmath68 . this is because the opening angle of the conical shell ( the collision surface of the two winds ) is @xmath69 , while the inclination angle is @xmath70",
    "this implies that @xmath71 , such that our line of sight toward the shocked secondary wind would go through the undisturbed secondary wind .",
    "the column density through this low density gas is very low .",
    "instead , we suggest that the secondary star resides on the far side during apastron , and the column density includes the undisturbed primary wind as well as the shocked primary wind .    to calculate the column density for our preferred orientation of @xmath11 , we follow ks08 and use the geometry as drawn schematically in fig . [",
    "fig : nhgeo ] .",
    "the contact discontinuity shape is approximated by an hyperboloid at a distance @xmath72 from the secondary at the stagnation point ( the stagnation point is the point where the two winds momenta balance each other ) .",
    "our model of the primary wind includes a weak pre - shock magnetic field . in the post shock region",
    "the gas is highly compressed , and the magnetic field becomes dominant .",
    "the magnetic pressure limits the compression of the postshocked primary wind .",
    "the uncertainties in the intensity and geometry of the magnetic field introduce large uncertainties ( kashi & soker 2007a )",
    ". the magnetic field role is parameterized by the compression factor @xmath73 which is the ratio between the pre - shock magnetic and ram pressure ( see equations 9 - 11 in kashi & soker 2007a ) . following the model for the post shocked primary wind which had been presented in kashi & soker 2007a",
    ", we will use the quantity @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the angle between the slow wind velocity and the primary wind shockwave , @xmath76 is the relative speed between the secondary and the primary wind , given in equation ( [ eq : vwind1 ] ) below , and @xmath77 is a parameter ( kashi & soker 2007a ) .",
    "the value of @xmath77 implies that the magnetic field has a negligible role before the shock , but not after .",
    "the column density is @xmath78 the compression factor together with a few more assumptions allow us to calculate the velocity of the post shock primary wind out from the shock region , and the width of the conical shock , @xmath79 ( see equation 12 in kashi & soker 2007a ) . from the width",
    "we can calculate the values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : nhgeo ] .",
    "the source of the hard x - ray is the post - shocked secondary wind ( pittard & corcoran 2002 ; corcoran 2005 ; a06 ) , taken here at the point marked on fig .",
    "[ fig : nhgeo ] by ` x - ray source ' .",
    "this point is located at a distance of @xmath82 from the stagnation point , or a distance of @xmath83 from that point .",
    "the x - ray emitting region is more extended , but it does not extend to large distances from the secondary , and our assumption is adequate .",
    "we assume @xmath84 . as evident from the figure ,",
    "the column density has two main components : the post - shocked primary wind component , @xmath85 ( the conical shell ) , and the undisturbed , free - expanding , primary wind component ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we calculate the contribution of each component to the total column density ( @xmath87 ) as a function of orbital angle @xmath88 ( @xmath88=0 at periastron ) .    as in our previous papers , we approximate the shape of the colliding winds conical shell as an hyperploid . in the present study we consider some additional effects , listed next , that makes the geometry more complicated and the results more accurate .",
    "similar considerations were used by us ( kashi & soker 2009b ) to explain the complex p cygni profile of the he  i  @xmath89 high excitation line .",
    "\\(1 ) * wind acceleration .",
    "* we take the primary wind acceleration into account .",
    "we describe it as a @xmath90-profile @xmath91 with a parameter @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the sound velocity on the primary surface , @xmath53 is the primary wind terminal velocity ( which was already defined earlier ) , @xmath94 is the distance from the primary center , and @xmath95 is the primary radius .",
    "the acceleration of the primary wind becomes important close to periastron , when the binary separation becomes only slightly larger than the primary radius .",
    "being slower and denser close to the surface , the accelerating primary wind yields a denser post shocked primary wind , and affects other variables in this already complex geometry .",
    "its slower velocity makes the hyperboloid asymptotic opening angle wider , and its rotation more pronounced , as we now explain .",
    "\\(2 ) * hyperboloid asymptotic opening angel . *",
    "the radial ( along the line joining the two stars ) component of the relative velocity between the secondary star and the primary wind is @xmath96 , where @xmath97 the radial component of the orbital velocity ; @xmath97 is negative when the two stars approach each other .",
    "the relative speed between the secondary and the primary wind is @xmath98^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : vwind1}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the tangential component of the orbital velocity . the orbital motion and the variation of the primary wind velocity with distance from the primary have an influence on the hyperboloid asymptotic opening angel @xmath100 .",
    "we use the expression given by eichler & usov ( 1993 ) @xmath101 where @xmath102 ( note that this definition of @xmath103 is different from the one used by p09 , where @xmath104 ) .",
    "@xmath100 has a minimum value of @xmath105 @xmath106  days before periastron , and reaches maximum of @xmath107 @xmath108  days after periastron .",
    "\\(3 ) * hyperboloid rotation . *",
    "we take into consideration the rotation of the hyperboloid relatively to the line connecting the two stars .",
    "namely , the winding of the wcr around the secondary star , as the secondary orbits the primary across periastron .",
    "this rotation ( winding ) has a considerable influence close to periastron .",
    "we define @xmath109 to be the angle measured from the secondary between the direction to the primary and that to the stagnation point ( see soker 2005 for further details ) @xmath110 we find that the maximum value of @xmath109 is obtained @xmath111  days after periastron , where it reaches @xmath112 .",
    "this makes the rotation of the hyperboloid non - negligible and very important for the more accurate calculation we perform in this paper .",
    "the equatorial plane of the geometry described above is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyperboloid ] .",
    "we take the inclination angle to be @xmath25 , and assume that the secondary is away from us during a apastron passage ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this geometry explicitly determines the direction from which the system is observed ( i.e. line of sight ) at each orbital phase . for every orbital angle @xmath88",
    "we calculate the relevant direction angle @xmath113 to the observer .",
    "considering the orientation of the conical shell at that orbital angle , we calculate the thickness of the conical shell in that direction and integrate @xmath114 over the width to find the column density of the first component : @xmath115 where @xmath116 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nhgeo ] ) . the second component contributing to the column density , the undisturbed primary wind ,",
    "is calculated from the point on the line of sight where the shock terminates , to infinity ( contribution decreases fast with distance ) @xmath117 to calculate the total column density we added a constant third component of @xmath118 to account for the material residing in the outer regions , e.g. , in the homunculus and in the ism , the same value as p09 used .",
    "the three column density components and the total column density are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nh ] . the column density toward the hot component based on the spectrum above @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath119 $ ] , from h07 is also plotted .",
    "our model reproduces to within a factor of two the results of h07 , and is with agreement with its qualitative behavior .",
    "this is done without any parameters fitting .",
    "namely , we simply take the values of the different parameters as in our previous papers , where some parameters were adjusted to fit other observations of @xmath0 car , such as the radio emission , some helium lines , and more .",
    "our results clearly shows that from our preferred line of sight ( @xmath11,@xmath25 ) the column density hardly changes during most of the orbital cycle and can supply the required high column density , in accord with observations .",
    "when the system approaches periastron passage there is a fast increase of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , followed by a decrease after periastron passage .",
    "one thing must be kept in mind .",
    "the ten - week x - ray minimum can not be explained by the model .",
    "a different ingredient must be incorporated ; one that extinguishes the conical shell .",
    "we take this process to be accretion onto the secondary star . for that",
    ", our calculation of @xmath45 with the wcr included is not applicable at all during the minimum , i.e. , the phase period @xmath120 .",
    "the flow structure around the secondary is more complicated , as it includes the accretion process , and possibly a polar outflow ( jets ) that results the extra soft source during the x - ray minimum ( see section [ sec : ex ] ) . the column density during the minimum might be better represented by an undisturbed primary wind in the entire space .",
    "as we are not sure where the polar outflow is shocked and forms the x - ray emitting regions , we take 3 possibilities for its location : at the location of the secondary itself ( which is the average of two opposite jets ) ; a region above the primary ( perpendicular to the equatorial plane ) of @xmath121 , and of @xmath122 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : min ] the column density to the x - ray emitting region in the cases is plotted during the x - ray minimum , and @xmath123 days ( a phase of @xmath124 ) before and after the minimum .",
    "we note that during the x - ray minimum the column densities toward the hard and soft x - ray sources are about equal ( ratio of @xmath125 ) , compared to a ratio of @xmath126 near apastron .",
    "the results presented in fig . [ fig : min ] suggest that the hard and soft x - ray components reside close to the secondary , and are not originated in the tail of the wcr .",
    "we also note that the observation point at phase @xmath127 is better fitted with a model that includes the conical shell ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nh ] ) than with a spherical primary wind , also shown as the solid blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : min ] .",
    "this points is well after the x - ray minimum , and this is an expected result .",
    "the point at phase @xmath128 can be marginally fitted if the wcr does exist , by changing somewhat the unknown parameters .",
    "however , it seems we can better fit it by assuming that the wcr is already highly disrupted at that time .",
    "namely , the collapse of the wcr starts around @xmath128 or somewhat earlier , as suggested by a06 .",
    "we note that the observed column density at phase @xmath43 of @xmath129 ( h07 ) occurred when the @xmath13 emission was @xmath130 above its average value during that time ( corcoran 2005 ) .",
    "this could result from a higher density of the primary wind . according to the model of a06",
    "the dependance of the x - ray emission on the primary mass loss rate is @xmath131 .",
    "namely , it is quite possible that the primary mass loss rate , and hence @xmath45 , were higher than the average value near apastron by a factor of @xmath132 , and this is the reason h07 did not find the column density to increase between phases @xmath43 ( @xmath133 ) and 0.92 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "another effect not considered by us , and that introduces more variations , both in the time variation and in the absorption by the conical shell along different directions , is the corrugated structure of the shocked primary wind that results from instabilities ( pittard & corcoran 2002 ; pittard et al .",
    "1998 ; okazaki et al . 2008 ; p09 ) .    as mentioned earlier , from behind the secondary shock ( namely , if the secondary is toward us near apastron ) , it is not possible to account for @xmath129 column density near apastron .",
    "it can not come from the nebula , as the nebula can supply @xmath135 at most , as deduced from the column density toward the low temperature gas ( the extra soft component , h07 ) .",
    "also , from figure 2 of p05 we learn that when the system is at apastron , there is a region extending to @xmath136 behind he secondary star that is cleaned from the primary wind by the tenuous secondary wind .",
    "namely , when observed through the secondary wind region the column density of the primary wind is very low , practically negligible . in the case of @xmath40 ( which we oppose ) , one would indeed observe through the secondary wind , because @xmath137 .",
    "to show this point , we have repeated our calculation for an opposite periastron longitude @xmath10 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nh270 ] .",
    "we see that for that case the column density long before and after periastron is highly underestimated . moreover , close to periastron the calculated hydrogen column density reaches @xmath138 ( outside the plotted region of fig . [",
    "fig : nh270 ] ) .",
    "this is about 5 times the observed value , while our orientation yields values less than twice the observed value . even though we admit our calculation of @xmath45",
    "is not applicable during the x - ray minimum , we crudely do get the increase factor of the column density between apastron and periastron as observed by h07 .",
    "in the case of @xmath10 , our calculations show a huge jump in the column density , not compatible with observations .",
    "this is mostly pronounced at phase @xmath46 ( @xmath139 ) , when the calculated column density for @xmath10 is too low to explain the observed value , and the minimum has not started yet .",
    "p09 discussed the possibility that the wcr collapses onto the secondary . in their discussion",
    "they mentioned that if the collapse occurs , then the secondary wind is continued to be blown on the other side of the secondary .",
    "they do not consider accretion .",
    "we now show that the regular secondary wind can not be blown during the event , not even half of it , and that if the wcr collapse occurs , then accretion in inevitable .",
    "p09 assumed that during x - ray minimum about half of the secondary wind is continued to be blown at @xmath140 from the side of the secondary not facing the primary .",
    "they then took the x - ray to come from regions away from the secondary , as if the colliding wind regions was unaffected .",
    "we show that this can not be the case .",
    "let the wind blown posses a fraction @xmath141 of the regular wind , such that the mass loss rate is @xmath142 . from figure 3 of p09",
    "we see that during the x - ray minimum the conical shell is wind - up in such a way that the secondary wind can not escape . at phase 1.02 ( 40 days after periastron passage ) the wind can propagate at most @xmath143 before encountering the primary dense wind ; most of the secondary wind is shocked at a much closer distance of @xmath144 .",
    "it does it within @xmath145  day , which is shorter than the time since minimum starts , but not by much .",
    "the volume of space available for the shocked secondary wind is @xmath146 .",
    "the mass blown during this time ( 40 days ) is @xmath147 .",
    "the proton number density is @xmath148 at a temperature of @xmath149 the emissivity is @xmath150 , and the total x - ray luminosity of the bubble is ( about half emitted in the @xmath13 band ) @xmath151 the emission measure @xmath152 , where @xmath20 is the electron density , is @xmath153 this emission measure is an order of magnitude larger than that of the hot gas deduce from x - ray observations during minimum x - ray emission ( h07 ) .",
    "if we reduce @xmath141 much below @xmath154 , the volume of the shocked secondary wind will be smaller .",
    "so in order to reduce the emission measure to @xmath155 , we should have @xmath156 .",
    "namely , an almost complete shutdown of the secondary wind .    as seen in figure 2 of p09 , the volume available for the shocked secondary wind during x - ray minimum is not closed , and the post - shocked wind will flow out , reducing the density and emission measure .",
    "however , the outflow time scale is not much shorter than the duration of the minimum , and this will not reduce the emission measure by much",
    ". on the other hand , there are effects that operate to increase the emission measure in the model of p09 .",
    "( 1 ) the side that blows the wind in their model is opposite to the primary direction .",
    "however , because of the winding of the tail ( its spiral structure ) this side is not toward the tail of the shocked region , and the secondary wind will be shocked in a short distance from the secondary of only several@xmath157 on average , at phase 1.02 .",
    "( 2 ) as mentioned above , the volume of @xmath158 is taken from their figure 2 , which is drawn for a full blown wind .",
    "if the secondary wind is weaker , the volume will be smaller .",
    "( 3 ) as discussed below , the gravity of the secondary will bend the primary wind stream lines toward the secondary .",
    "this will increase the ram pressure of the primary wind , and by that further reduce the volume .",
    "p09 mentioned that the primary wind comes very close to the secondary , but did not consider accretion according the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton model , but rather took the accretion radius to be the secondary radius .",
    "this is not consistent with the well established accretion process where the accretion radius should be the bondi - hoyle accretion radius @xmath159 for a secondary mass of @xmath48 .",
    "the accretion radius was calculated by a06 , and was found to be @xmath160 at phase @xmath161 .",
    "this is @xmath34 times the radius of the secondary star .",
    "as was discussed by soker ( 2005 ) , a06 , and kashi & soker ( 2009a ) , the secondary stellar radiation pressure and wind can not prevent accretion .",
    "we note that soker ( 2005 ) considered the ram pressure of the secondary wind , as well as the radiation pressure .",
    "that ram pressure and radiation pressure can not prevent accretion is true for a smooth wind , and more so as dense blobs are expected to exist in the primary wind due to stochastic mass loss processes and instabilities in the colliding winds ( pittard & corcoran 2002 ) .",
    "p09 mentioned that the secondary wind can destroy the falling dense blobs .",
    "this process should be studied in a future paper , but must include the magnetic field within the blobs .",
    "the magnetic field in the blob might prevent efficient ablation .",
    "kashi & soker ( 2009a ) further include the acceleration zone of the primary wind , and find the secondary stellar gravity to be more important even than what was found by soker ( 2005 ) and a06 . neglecting the secondary gravity by p09 makes their results questionable , e.g. , their claim that no substantial accretion occurs is not supported .",
    "we do note that the accreted mass can not account for the strong x - ray component by itself .",
    "the temperature of the strong soft x - ray component during the x - ray minimum is @xmath162 ( h07 ) , about an order of magnitude below the hard x - ray component .",
    "this temperature is formed in the postshocked region of gas flowing with a velocity of @xmath163 . in the case of an inflow",
    "the gas is compresses , and a velocity range of @xmath164 is required . in the case of an outflow , adiabatic cooling occurs and the required outflow velocity is @xmath165 .",
    "the free fall velocity onto the secondary star is @xmath166 .",
    "however , the accreted flow will be shocked somewhere above the surface , and it seems it can not account for the temperature of the soft component .",
    "neither the accreted mass can account for the emission measure .",
    "the high emission measure of the soft component is @xmath167 ( h07 ) , for an average of @xmath168 .",
    "it is not clear how long this high emission measure phase lasts , as h07 give only two measurements during the x - ray minimum .",
    "we assume this high emission measure phase to last 5 weeks . during a time period of @xmath169",
    "weeks the total intrinsic x - ray emission ( before absorption ) is @xmath170 . in kashi & soker ( 2009a )",
    "we estimated the accreted mass during the @xmath171 x - ray minimum to be @xmath172 .",
    "the available energy is at most @xmath173 , for @xmath174 .",
    "the accreted gas can not account for the high emission measure of the soft x - ray component .",
    "an alternative is discussed in section [ sec : ex ] .      in our calculations ( here and in ks08 )",
    "we studied the properties of the hot gas , i.e. , the component that is the source of the x - ray emission above @xmath57 according to h07 .",
    "let us examine the properties of the extra soft component .",
    "its temperature is @xmath175 , and its contribution to the x - ray emission is larger than that of the hot component in the @xmath176 x - ray band ( h07 ) . in our calculations",
    "( here and in ks08 ) the column density is calculated to a region near the stagnation point of the colliding winds .",
    "this is the region where the secondary wind shock is strong and no adiabatic cooling has occurred yet , and hence hard x - ray emission is expected . in all cases and parameters",
    "the average calculated column density during the x - ray minimum is above the observed value .",
    "this is true for both the hot and the extra soft component .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission region is located at somewhat larger distance from the secondary star .    during the minimum",
    "the emission measure of the hard x - ray decreases substantially , while that of the soft x - ray increases by more than an order of magnitude ( h07 ) .",
    "as the emission measure of the soft component increases , so does the column density toward its emission region .",
    "the column densities of the hard and soft component become comparable ; at all other phases the column density of the soft component is smaller than that of the hard component .",
    "the high column density shows that the emitting region can not be too far from the secondary star .",
    "we suggest that the regular winds collision does not occur during the x - ray minimum .",
    "rather , there is a polar outflow ( jets ) .",
    "during the x - ray minimum the regular secondary wind is substantially suppressed to only few percents of its regular intensity .",
    "this explains the small emission measure of the hard component . instead , we suggest that the accretion disk around the secondary star , formed by the accreted primary wind material , forces the outflow to direct in the polar directions .",
    "the outflowing material is composed of the secondary wind and accreted gas . in kashi & soker ( 2009a )",
    "we estimated the average rate at which the secondary accretes mass from the primary during the x - ray minimum to be @xmath177 .",
    "we note that the accretion rate is about equal to the undisturbed secondary wind .",
    "this suggests that the accretion process substantially disturbes the wind , but can not completely prevent an outflow .    to account for the soft x - ray component , with a total radiated energy of @xmath178 ( see section [ sec : acc ] )",
    ", we can take an average mass loss rate over the 10  weeks of @xmath179 with a velocity of @xmath180 .",
    "p09 found that the post shocked region of gas flowing at this velocity can match the spectrum at x - ray minimum .",
    "namely , the secondary mass loss rate does not change much , but it is forced to the polar direction .",
    "the high mass loss rate over a smaller angle results in a less efficient acceleration process , and the terminal speed is about a half of its regular value .",
    "this polar outflow can not escape from the dense primary wind , and most of its kinetic energy is converted to x - ray emission .",
    "the presence of a polar outflow in @xmath0 car , before and during the x - ray minimum , was suggested before , based on the behavior of the he  ii  @xmath1814686 line ( soker & behar 2006 ) , and on the doppler shift of x - ray lines ( behar et al .",
    "theoretical motivation for a strong secondary polar outflow during and at the end of the x - ray minimum is given by kashi & soker ( 2009a ) .",
    "we studied the usage of the x - ray properties to deduce the orientation of the semi - major axis of @xmath0 car .",
    "it is agreed by most researchers that the inclination of the binary system is @xmath182 . however , there is a dispute on the direction of the semi - major axis in the equatorial plane , the so called periastron longitude , or orientation .",
    "the definition of the periastron longitude angle in the orbital plane is given in equation ( [ eq : omega ] ) .",
    "in section [ sec : xray ] we argued that the x - ray light curve by itself can not be used to deduce the orientation .",
    "this conclusion is based in part on the results of a06 , who showed that with some adjustment of the binary unknown parameters , e.g. , exact wind properties , the x - ray light curve can be fitted by using almost any periastron longitude and any inclination angle .",
    "the only large differences between the different orientations occur near periastron passage .",
    "but there , all models must assume a suppression of x - ray emission , such that the period of @xmath183 months around periastron passage is useless in simple models that use only the x - ray light curve .",
    "in section [ sec : n_h ] we modelled the column density as deduced from x - ray observations by h07 .",
    "we considered some additional effects that we did nt take into account in ks08 , which make our modelling more accurate and our conclusion that @xmath11 more reliable .",
    "the periastron longitude deduced in p09 , @xmath184 , is more or less opposite to our preferred value of @xmath11 .",
    "we showed that their periastron longitude is not in agreement with observations of the column density , particulary close to apastron .    in section [ sec : residual ]",
    "we considered the secondary wind during the x - ray minimum .",
    "we showed that the emission measure of the hard x - ray emission as measured by h07 during the x - ray minimum , constrains the regular secondary wind , i.e. , that with the same terminal velocity of @xmath140 , to have a mass loss rate of @xmath185 times its regular value , and probably only @xmath186 times its regular value .",
    "the emission measure of the soft x - ray component , on the other hand , is very large during the x - ray minimum ( h07 ) . in section [ sec : ex ]",
    "we suggested that the source of this emission is shocked polar outflow ( or a collimated polar wind , or two jets ) .",
    "the polar outflow is formed by the accretion process , which focuses the secondary wind to polar directions , and launches some material from the accretion disk .",
    "the inevitability of the accretion process ( kashi & soker 2009a ) was discussed in section [ sec : acc ] .",
    "the denser wind along the polar directions makes acceleration less efficient .",
    "this result in a slower outflow @xmath187 , and softer x - ray emission .        1 .",
    "they gave a heavy weight to the light curve .",
    "however , the light curve can be fitted by almost any inclination and orientation angles , with some adjustment of parameters ( no fine tuning is required ; a06 ) .",
    "2 .   in the @xmath13 band",
    "the main source ( @xmath65 of the observed flux ) of the x - ray emission is the hot component that was defined by h07",
    ". the column density should be the one toward this component , and not toward the entire emitting gas , that contains also component at a temperature of @xmath190 .",
    "the column density calculated by p09 is much lower than observed .",
    "p09 assumed that the emission measure goes as @xmath191 , where @xmath16 is the orbital separation .",
    "however , the emission measure deduced from observations increases by a smaller factor as the system approaches periastron ( h07 ) .",
    "according to the semimajor orientation deduced by p09 , near apastron our line of sight goes through the tenuous secondary wind .",
    "the column density is very low as evident from our fig .",
    "[ fig : nh270 ] .",
    "the calculation of p09 did not show this low column density .",
    "5 .   the calculated behavior during the ten - week x - ray minimum ( and few days before and after ) can not be reproduced by the models ( neither ours , or a06 , or of p09 ) , and can not be used to reject or accept a model ; it seems accretion of the primary wind by the secondary is inevitable . in rejecting the @xmath189 orientation , p09 gave too much weight to the x - ray minimum period .",
    "recent observations of the rxte lightcurve of @xmath0 car reveal an early recovery of the x - ray minimum ( corcoran 2009 ) .",
    "while the previous two x - ray minima lasted for 10  weeks , the 2009 x - ray minimum lasted for only @xmath34  weeks .",
    "the possibility that the x - ray emission can recover several days earlier than in previous cycles was mentioned by us before ( section 8.3 in kashi & soker 2009a ) , as we were considering small ( @xmath192 ) fluctuations in the primary wind properties .",
    "the early recovery is attributed to a weaker primary wind that allows the secondary wind to recover earlier . in the accretion model",
    "the very early recovery teaches us that the major changes in the primary wind are related to the acceleration process ( kashi & soker 2009a ) , and that the variations are large in the sense that the wind reaches its terminal speed much closer to the primary .",
    "a quantitative study is the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the implication of the accretion process goes beyond present day @xmath0 car . during the 1837 - 1856 great eruption a mass of @xmath193",
    "was lost by the primary ( smith et al .",
    "2003 ; smith 2006 ; smith & ferland 2007 ) .",
    "if accretion occurs at present periastron passages , when mass loss rate is lower by more than three orders of magnitudes than that during the great eruption , it must have occurred during the great eruption along most , or even all , of the orbit ( soker 2001 , 2007 ) . the gravitational energy released by the accreted mass could have been the major extra energy in the great eruption , both in extra radiation and wind s kinetic energy ( soker 2007 ) .",
    "it is possible that major eruptions of luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) are related to such accretion events as the primary losses high amounts of mass .",
