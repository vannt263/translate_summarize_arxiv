    "in addition , the thoughtful processing of degenerate cases makes the implementation of geometric algorithms laborious  @xcite .",
    "the meaning of degeneracy always depends on the context ( e.g. , three points on a line , four points on a circle ) .",

    "@xcite suggests an implementation of an exact arithmetic .",
    "this is established by a number representation of variable precision ( i.e. , variable bit length ) or the use of symbolic values which are not evaluated ( e.g. , roots of integers ) .",
    "there are several implementations of such number types  @xcite .",
    "each program must be developed carefully such that it can deal with all possible degenerate cases .",
    "the software libraries leda and cgal follow the exact computation paradigm  @xcite .",
    "the paradigm was also taken as a basis in  @xcite .    as opposed to that ,",
    "the _ topology oriented approach _  @xcite is based on an arithmetic of finite precision .",
    "to avoid numerical robustness issues , the main guideline is the maintenance of the topology .",
    "this objective requires individual alterations of the algorithm at hand and it seems that it can not be turned into an easy - to - use general framework .",
    "furthermore , this approach must also cope with degenerate inputs .",
    "however , the speed of floating - point arithmetic may be worth the trouble ; in addition with other accelerations , held  @xcite has implemented a very fast computation of the voronoi diagram of line segments .",
    "there are also _ problem - oriented _ solutions . in computational geometry",
    ", the sign of determinants decides an interesting class of predicates .",
    "for example , the side - of - line or the in - circle predicate in the plane belong to this class and are used in the computation of delaunay diagrams .",
    "some publications attack the numerical issues in the evaluation of determinants directly  @xcite .",
    "the previous approaches have in common that they primarily focus on the numerical issues .",
    "other approaches are originated from the degeneracy issue .",
    "a slight perturbation of the input seems to solve this problem .",
    "there are different approaches which are based on perturbation .",
    "the _ symbolic perturbation _ , see for example @xcite , provides a general way to distort inputs such that degeneracies do not occur .",
    "this definitely provides a shorter route for the presentation of geometric algorithms .",
    "practically this approach requires exact arithmetic to avoid robustness issues .",
    "therefore the pitfall in this approach is that , if the concept requires very small perturbations , it implicates a high precision and possibly a slow implementation .    in this paper",
    "we focus on _ controlled perturbation_. this variant was introduced by halperin et al .",
    "@xcite for the computation of spherical arrangements .",
    "there a perturbed input is a random point in the neighborhood of the initial input .",
    "it is unlikely , but not impossible , that the input is degenerate .",
    "therefore the algorithm has a repeating perturbation process with two objectives : finding an input that does not contain degeneracies and that leads to numerically robust floating - point evaluations .",
    "halperin et al .  have presented mechanisms to respond to inappropriate perturbations .",
    "moreover , they have argued formally under which conditions there is a chance for a successful termination of their algorithm .",
    "_ controlled perturbation leads to numerically robust implementations of algorithms which use non - exact arithmetic and which do not need to process degenerate cases .",
    "_    this idea of controlled perturbation was applied to further geometric problems afterwards : the arrangement of polyhedral surfaces  @xcite , the arrangement of circles  @xcite , voronoi diagrams and delaunay triangulations  @xcite .",
    "however , the presentation of each specific algorithm has required a specific analysis of its performance .",
    "this broaches the subject of a _ general method _ to analyze controlled perturbation algorithms .",
    "we remark that controlled perturbation has also a shady side : although it solves the problem for the perturbed input exactly , it does not solve it for the initial input .",
    "furthermore , it is non - obvious how to receive a solution for the initial input in general . in case",
    "the input is highly degenerated , the running time of the algorithm may increase significantly after the permutation  @xcite . in this case , the specialized treatment of degeneracies may be much faster .",
    "the study of a general method to analyze controlled perturbation algorithms is a joint work with kurt mehlhorn and michael sagraloff .",
    "we have firstly presented the idea in @xcite . then caroli  @xcite studied the applicability of the method for predicates which are used for the computation of arrangements of circles ( according to  @xcite ) and the computation of voronoi diagrams of line segments ( according to  @xcite ) .",
    "our significantly improved journal article contains , furthermore , a detailed discussion of the analysis of multivariate polynomials  @xcite .",
    "independent of former publications , the author has redeveloped the topic from scratch to design a sophisticated tool box for the analysis of controlled perturbation algorithms .",
    "the tool box is valid for floating - point arithmetic , guides step by step through the analysis and allows alternative components .",

    "the result is a precision function or a probability function .",
    "furthermore , necessary conditions for the analysis are derived from the interfaces ( e.g. , the notion of _ criticality _ differs from former publications ) .",
    "_ we present alternative approaches to derive necessary bounds .",
    "_ because we have subdivided the tool box into independent components and their interfaces , it is possible to make alternative components available in the most crucial step of the analysis .",
    "the _ direct approach _ is based on the geometric meaning of predicates , the _ bottom - up approach _ is based on the composition of functions , and the _ top - down approach _ is a coordinate - wise analysis of functions .",

    "a random floating - point number generator that guarantees a uniform distribution was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "but , so far , the result of the analysis was never proven to be valid for the finite set of floating - point numbers since the lebesgue measure can not take sets of measure zero into account . to overcome this issue",

    "we define a fixed - precision perturbation generator and extend it to be object - preserving .",
    "we explain the particularities in the practical treatment of range errors that occur especially in the case of rational functions .",
    "finally , we show how to realize guards for rational functions .",

    "this section contains an introduction to the basic principles for controlled perturbation algorithms .",
    "we have already mentioned that implementations of geometric algorithms must address degeneracy issues and numerical robustness issues .",
    "we review floating - point arithmetic in section  [ sec - intro - floating - point ] and present the basic design principles of controlled perturbation algorithms in section  [ sec - intro - cp - algo ] .",

    "we explain this statement with the following thought experiment exceeds a given threshold @xmath0 , the precision is augmented and @xmath1 is reset . ]",
    "that can be skipped during first reading : assume we compute an arrangement of @xmath2 circles incrementally with a fixed precision arithmetic .",
    "let us further assume that there is an upper bound on the radius of the circles . then , because of the fixed precision , the number of distinguishable intersections per circle must be limited .",
    "hence the computation of a dense arrangement gets stuck after a certain amount of insertions unless we allow circles to be moved ( perturbed ) further away from their initial location .",
    "asymptotically , this policy transforms a very dense arrangement into an arrangement of almost uniformly distributed circles .",
    "therefore we demand that the precision of the arithmetic can be chosen arbitrarily large .",
    "a _ floating - point number _ is given by a sign , a mantissa , a radix and a signed exponent . in the regular case , its value is defined as @xmath3 without loss of generality , we assume the radix to be 2 . the bit length of the mantissa is called _ precision _ @xmath4 . we denote the _ bit length of the exponent _ by @xmath5 .",
    "the discrete set of regular floating - point numbers is a subset of the rational numbers .",
    "furthermore , this set is finite for fixed @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "a _ floating - point arithmetic _ defines the number representation ( the radix , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) , the operations , the rounding policy and the exception handling for floating - point numbers ( see goldberg  @xcite ) .",
    "a technical standard for fixed precision floating - point arithmetic is ieee 754 - 2008 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays , the built - in types single , double and quadruple precision are usual for radix 2 .",

    "core provides the variable precision floating - point number type core::bigfloat ( see  @xcite ) . and",
    "leda provides the variable precision floating - point number type leda_bigfloat ( see the leda book  @xcite ) .",
    "be aware that the rounding policy and exception handling of certain libraries may differ from the ieee standard . since our analysis partially presumes .",
    "] this standard , we must ensure that the arithmetic in use is appropriate .",
    "the gnu multiple precision floating - point reliable library , for example , `` provides the four rounding modes from the ieee 754 - 1985 standard , plus away - from - zero , as well as for basic operations as for other mathematical functions '' ( see the gnu mpfr manual  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , gnu mpfr is used for the multiple precision interval arithmetic which is provided by the multiple precision floating - point interval library ( see the gnu mpfi manual  @xcite ) .",
