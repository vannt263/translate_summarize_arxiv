    "we therefore use the r - matrix collision strengths of @xcite where they exist .",
    "we note that the problem of matching levels between the calculations persists . for most levels , we have matched the levels with the same electron configuration and total angular momentum , @xmath37 , and then paired these results in energy order . for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 levels",
    "there are different numbers of levels ( for the former configuration , our calculation has 2 more levels for each of @xmath37=2 , 3 and 4 ; for the latter @xcite have 2 more ) .",

    "the correction applied to the 5f-3d lines was a further @xmath45 compared to the simple multiplication by the 0.9817 scaling factor , in opposite directions .",
    "this implies that a correction at a similar level may be required in the case of these weaker lines .",

    "they noted in these observations a significant missing flux in the 94  region . since the launch of the sdo",
    ", the lack of a collisional excitation calculation has led to several authors using creative means to account for this difference .",
    "when looking at coronal loop emission @xcite used a scaling factor obtained by comparing the relative intensities of the known transition lines and the @xmath50 in the spectrum observed by @xcite .",

    "there is significant discrepancy here : it would be an interesting exercise to investigate whether the dem analysis of @xcite can be self consistent using the new emission estimate in this filter band .",
    "it is also possible that there are futher lines from different ions in the filter which have not yet been correctly handled .",
    "it is difficult to estimate uncertainties in the results from this work due to the many overlapping sources of error . as well as the two main lines which are the focus of this work , there are many smaller lines of uncertain wavlength .",
    "given the observed and initially calculated 5f @xmath43 3d wavelengths differ by around 0.5% , adding normally distributed random errors to these lines of @xmath60  gives a 10% standard deviation in the resulting emission in the 94  filter .",
    "this 10% fluctuation is then approximately a 5% effect on the total emission in the band once is also included . given that the estimates of uncertainty in distorted wave excitation collisions are usually not better than 20% , this is not expected to be a dominating source of error in the calculation .",
    "for those levels which appear in both this work and the collisional calculation of @xcite , comparison of the collision strengths for excitation from the ground state at @xmath44k between this data and our fac results show that they vary by on average around 25% .",
    "this is a very approximate lower limit on the likely errors on the calculation of emission in the 94  band , since excluding cascades from the n=6 shell , this is the only way to populated the 5f upper levels in this model , and for these levels we are using the distorted wave , not r - matrix , methods .",
