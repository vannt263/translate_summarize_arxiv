    "the presence of vortex tangle appearing in the superfluid turbulent heii essentially changes hydrodynamic properties of the latter ( see e.g.@xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) . according phenomena",
    "are studied in frame of so called phenomenological theory ( pt ) pioneered by vinen @xcite and greatly modified by schwarz @xcite .",
    "the pt describes superfluid turbulence ( st ) in terms of the total length of vortex lines ( per unit of volume ) or the vortex line density ( vld ) @xmath0 and of the structure parameters of the vt .",
    "knowledge of these quantities allows to calculate some of hydrodynamic characteristics of superfluid turbulent heii such as a mutual friction , sound attenuation etc .",
    "meanwhile there exist many other physical quantities connected to distribution of the filaments and their interaction related with other physical phenomena which can not be expressed in terms of the pt .",
    "the relevant phenomena should be covered by appropriate stochastic theory of chaotic vortex filaments .",
    "of course , the most honest way to develop such theory is to study stochastic dynamics of vortex filaments on the base of equations of motion with some source of chaos .",
    "however due to extremely involved dynamics of vortex lines this way seems to be almost hopeless .",
    "thus , a necessity of a developing an advanced phenomenological approach appeared .",
    "we offer one variant of such approach .",
    "the main idea and the main strategy are the following .",
    "although the phenomenological theory of the superfluid turbulence deals with macroscopical characteristics of the vortex tangle , it conveys the rich information concerning the _ instantaneous _ structure of the vortex tangle .",
    "namely we know that the vt consists of the closed loops labelled by @xmath1 , uniformly distributed in space and having the total length @xmath2 per unit of volume",
    ". from acoustical experiments it follows that filaments are distributed in anisotropic manner and quantitative characteristics of this anisotropy can be expressed by some structure parameters ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . beside this usual anisotropy",
    "there is more subtle anisotropy connected with averaged polarization of the vortex loops .",
    "furthermore there are some proofs that the averaged curvature of the vortex lines is proportional to the inverse interline space and coefficient of this proportionality ( which is of order of unit ) was obtained in numerical simulations made by schwarz [ 4 ] .",
    "the master idea of our proposal is to construct a trial distribution function ( tdf ) in the space of the vortex loops of the most general form which satisfies to all of the properties of the vt introduced above .",
    "we assume that this trial distribution function will enable us to calculate any physical quantities due to the vt . in the paper",
    "we describe typical shape of vortex loop obtained from evaluating of the correlation functions .",
    "we also calculate the average hydrodynamic impulse ( or lamb impulse ) @xmath3 in the counterflowing superfluid turbulent heii and the average kinetic energy @xmath4 associated with the chaotic vortex loop .",
    "according to general prescriptions the average of any quantity @xmath5 depending on vortex loop configurations is given by @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a probability of the vortex tangle to have a particular configuration @xmath8 .",
    "index @xmath9 distinguishes different loops .",
    "the meaning of summation over all vortex loop configurations @xmath10 in formula ( [ a(conf ) ] ) will be clear from further presentation .",
    "we put the usual in the statistical physics supposition that all configuration corresponding to the same macroscopic state have equal probabilities .",
    "thus the probability @xmath7 for vortex tangle to have a particular configuration @xmath8 should be proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number of allowed configurations , of course infinite    @xmath13    _  under term  allowed configurations",
    " _ @xmath12 _ _  we mean only the configurations that will lead to the correct values for all average quantities known from experiment and numerical simulations .",
    "_ _ formally it can be expressed as a path integral in space of three - dimensional ( closed ) curves supplemented with some constrains connected to properties of the vt .",
    "@xmath14    the constrains entering this relation are expressed by delta functions expressing fixed properties of the vt .",
    "for instance constrain @xmath15 expresses that parameter @xmath16 is the arc length .",
    "however this condition will lead to not tractable theory .",
    "we will use a trick known from the theory of polymer chains ( see e.g.@xcite ) , namely we will relax rigorous condition and change delta function by continuous ( gaussian ) distribution of the link length with the same value of integral .",
    "this trick leads to the following expression for number of way : @xmath17 in the same manner we are able to introduce and treat other constrains connected to the known properties of the vt structure . the detailed calculations are exposed in paper of one of the author  @xcite ,",
    "now we write down final expression for probability of configurations @xmath18 here @xmath19 is one - dimensional fourier transform of variable @xmath20 and lagrangian @xmath21 is a quadratic form of the components of the vector variable @xmath19 @xmath22 in practice to calculate various averages it is convenient to work with the characteristic ( generating ) functional ( cf ) which is defined as a following average : @xmath23 due to that our lagrangian [ l(matrix)]is a quadratic form ( in @xmath19 ) and , consequently , the trial distribution function is a gaussian one , calculation of the cf can be made by accomplishing the full square procedure to give a result @xmath24 elements of matrix @xmath25 are specified from calculation of total length , anisotropy coefficient , curvature and polarization .",
    "the explicit form of them is written down in @xcite .",
    "thus we reached the put goal and have written the expression for trial cf which , we repeat , enables us to calculate any averaged of the vortex filament configuration .",
    "for instance calculating some of the correlation functions we are able to describe a typical shape of the averaged curve .",
    "it is sketched out in fig.[loop ]     where @xmath26 is arc length , @xmath27 is a tangent vector , unit vector along the vortex line ; @xmath28 is the local curvature vector ; vector production @xmath29 is binormal which is responsible for mutual orientation of the tangent vector and vector of curvature .",
    "close @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mean curvature @xmath32 parts of the line are separated in @xmath33 space by distance @xmath34 the distant part @xmath35 are separated in @xmath33 space by distance @xmath36 ( with correction due to the closeness ) .",
    "the latter property reflects a random walk structure of the vortex loops . as a whole",
    "the loop is not isotropic having a  pancake  form .",
    "in addition it has a total polarization @xmath37 forcing the loop to drift along vector @xmath38 and to produce nonzero superfluid mass current in z - direction ]",
    "as an one more illustration to the developed theory we discuss hydrodynamic impulse of the vortex tangle @xmath39 which is defined as @xmath40 the quantity @xmath41 is closely related to momentum of fluid ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the averaged @xmath42 is immediately evaluated by use of cf ( [ w(pg ) ] ) to give the following result : @xmath43 \\rho _ s\\mathbf{v_s }   \\label{jz2}\\ ] ] note that the coefficient includes no fitting parameters but only characteristics known from the phenomenological theory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "relation ( [ jz2 ] ) shows that the vortex tangle induces the superfluid current directed against the external superfluid current .",
    "it should be expected since there is some preferable polarization of the vortex loops . in the experiments",
    "this additional superfluid current should display itself as suppression of the superfluid density .",
    "this effect is 3d analog to the famous kosterlitz - thoulless effect except of that distribution of the vortex lines is not calculated but is obtained appealing to the experimental data .",
    "since superfluid density enters an expression for second sound velocity , it seems attractive to detect it using transverse second sound testing . to do it we have firstly to evaluate transverse change of the @xmath44 and , secondly , to develop the theory to match it to nonstationary case .",
    "the general theory asserts that while applying a harmonic external second sound field suppression of superfluid density becomes the function of frequency @xmath45 of the following form : @xmath46 here transverse @xmath47 is half of the one given by rel .",
    "( [ jz2 ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is the time of relaxation of the superfluid current @xmath49 which is to be found from dynamical consideration .",
    "first , we have to derive @xmath50 with help of the equation of motion of the vortex line elements and , second , to evaluate various averaged appearing in right - hand side .",
    "function we obtain the following final result for change of the second sound velocity . performing all of described procedures",
    "one obtains that the relative change @xmath51 of the second sound velocity is given by    @xmath52    here the function @xmath53 is composed of the structure parameters of the vortex tangle @xmath54 decreasing of the second sound velocity in the counterflowing heii has been really observed about two decades ago by vidal with coauthors @xcite .",
    "let us compare our result ( [ du ] ) with the vidal s experiment . using the data on the structure parameters one obtains that e.g. for the temperatures @xmath55 the value of function @xmath53 is about @xmath56 .",
    "taking the frequency @xmath57  @xmath58 , used in @xcite , and @xmath59 one obtains that @xmath60 @xmath61 , which is very close to the observed value .",
    "in this section we calculate the averaged energy of the stochastic vortex loop distributed according trial distribution function ( [ nall(lagr ) ] ) .",
    "the general expression for the energy associated with linear vortices can be written as ( see e.g. @xcite )    @xmath62    in 3d fourier space the average energy @xmath4 ( [ e(ksi ) ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath63    comparing ( [ e(k ) ] ) and ( [ w(pg ) ] ) it is possible to express the energy @xmath4 in terms of the characteristic functional    @xmath64    here set of @xmath65 in cf @xmath66 is again determined with help of the @xmath67-functions    @xmath68    the relation ( [ teta(abc ) ] ) implies that we have to choose in integrand in exponent of cf only points lying in interval from @xmath69 to @xmath70 on @xmath71 -curve and from @xmath69 to @xmath72 on @xmath9-curve . while evaluation of self - energy of the same loop , @xmath73 , one has to distinguish points @xmath70 , and to put them to be e.g. @xmath74 and@xmath75 .",
    "further results concern the case of the only loop of length @xmath76 . omitting tremendous calculations we write down the final answer in the following form : @xmath77 \\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quantities @xmath78 ( of order of unit ) are expressed via the structure parameters of the vt",
    "as follows ( below@xmath79 )    @xmath80    @xmath81    @xmath82    let us comment expression ( [ efinal ] ) .",
    "the first term in the right - hand side of ( [ efinal ] ) is just the energy of unit of length of a straight vortex filament ( see e.g. @xcite ) multiplied by its length . in this form",
    "it is frequently used in theory of superfluid turbulence ( see e.g. @xcite ) and in other applications .",
    "but there are additional terms .",
    "the third and forth terms appeared from long - range interaction , they are smaller then logarithmic ones ( about ten percents ) .",
    "the third term is of especial interest .",
    "it appeared due to polarization of the vortex loop and its presence implies that there is some elasticity of the vortex tangle in @xmath83 direction .",
    "results of the previous section showed that the vt induces some additional superfluid flow .",
    "therefore one can expect that combination of longitudinal elasticity combining with inertia of additional will lead to appearing of elastic waves , 3d analog of the tkachenko waves .",
    "the second one is also logarithmically large .",
    "logarithmic behaviour points out that this contribution came from denominator @xmath84 .",
    "but it was the first ( local ) term which collected contributions from neighbor points along the line .",
    "therefore the third term appeared from accidental self - crossing of remote ( along the line ) parts of the vortex filament .",
    "the fact that this term is proportional to @xmath76 and is of of the first ( local ) contribution is due to that the line is fractal object with haussdorf @xmath85 dimension equal @xmath86 according to general theory of fractal lines it has an infinite number of self - crossing with cardinal number @xmath87 i.e. it is equivalent to line .",
    "we briefly exposed an essence of gaussian model of the vortex tangle and give several examples how it can be used for evaluation of important physical characteristics such as induced momentum and energy of interaction .",
    "these characteristics has been discussed early ( see e.g. @xcite ) , however their evaluation has not been performed because of lack of a proper theory .",
    "we think that these illustrations convince that gaussian model can serve as effective tool to study chaotic vortex filaments ."
