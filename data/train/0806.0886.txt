    "however , a good knowledge of the energy - dependence of the @xmath0-detector s efficiency is also required . here",
    "we report studies of our @xmath0-detector s response function , with source measurements and monte carlo calculations performed with the geant4 ( version  4.9.0 ) toolkit  @xcite .    in a typical measurement of a @xmath0-decay branching ratio ( see , for example , ref .",

    "we record both @xmath0 singles and @xmath0-@xmath3 coincident events .",
    "since the efficiency of the hpge detector has been very precisely determined  @xcite , to first order a @xmath0-branching ratio is simply given by the measured number of coincident @xmath3 rays that follow that @xmath0 branch divided by the total number of @xmath0 singles from all branches ; the @xmath0-detector efficiency simply cancels out and need not be determined . for high precision ,",
    "though , it becomes necessary to account for the slightly different efficiency of the @xmath0 detector for each @xmath0 transition , a difference that affects the measured intensities of the coincident @xmath3 rays .",

    "the scintillator and light guide are enclosed in a cylindrical cover ( 1 ) made from pvc.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    the energy dependence of our @xmath0-detection efficiency is caused principally by the low - energy electronic threshold , which removes a slightly different fraction of the total @xmath0 spectrum for different end - point energies . since",
    "our threshold is at @xmath880 kev and , for our superallowed - decay studies , end - point energies are typically 2 mev or more , we lose at most a few percent of the total @xmath0 particles for any single transition .",
    "thus the change in this loss from transition to transition in the same decay is even smaller .",
    "nevertheless , the precision we strive for in our branching - ratio measurements is very high and we seek to account reliably for that energy dependence . even though a monte carlo code like geant4 should be well suited to simulating the response function of a thin plastic scintillator , we considered it important to test and evaluate the code s results first , by comparing them against experimental data taken with several @xmath0 sources that also emit conversion - electrons : @xmath9ba , @xmath10cs and @xmath11bi .",

    "this approach considerably reduced the computing time without compromising the results .",
    "a test run with low thresholds in all regions did not reveal any significant differences from the sped - up version with different thresholds in different regions .",
    "it was pointed out by kraev  @xcite that , to get good agreement with experiment , it is important to choose two parameters particularly carefully in the _ low - energy _ em physics model of geant4 : the cut for secondaries ( _ cfs _ ) value , which determines the production threshold for secondary particles , and the @xmath12-parameter , which limits the step size for tracking @xmath0-particles at a material boundary . in this work",

    "to simulate the decay of a radioactive nuclide with geant4 , it is possible to define each @xmath3 transition , internal - conversion line and @xmath0-decay spectrum individually and require geant4 to transport all particles through the specified materials and determine the spectrum in the scintillator .",
    "however , the code also offers a radioactive - decay module , which generates all the decay components radiated from a specified source using information extracted from the evaluated nuclear structure data file ( ensdf )  @xcite .",

    "when repeating this procedure for @xmath9ba , to our surprise we found that the electron emission spectrum produced by the radioactive - decay module of geant4 was simply not correct , yielding relative conversion - electron intensities in significant disagreement with ensdf data .",

    "however , before this result could be compared with the experimental spectrum , it was necessary to add the effects of statistical fluctuations introduced by the processes of light production and transmission , as well as photomultiplication and electronic pulse analysis .",
    "for this purpose , we looked to a published study of the response of a plastic scintillator to mono - energetic beams of positrons and electrons @xcite , which tabulated the width of the full - energy gaussian peak as a function of energy between 0.8 and 3.8  mev .",
    "since we also needed to deal with energies lower than that , we took the width to be linearly dependent on energies below 0.8  mev .",
    "our procedure was to take the scintillator spectrum produced by geant4 and process it by a randomization algorithm written in c@xmath16 in the root @xcite analysis framework .",
    "in essence , this process spread the number of counts in each energy bin into a gaussian distribution centered at the original energy and with a width , @xmath17 , taken or extrapolated from ref .",

    "we wrote our own c++ root program to accomplish this purpose .",
    "the resulting comparisons for our three sources , as well as the normalized residuals , for @xmath9ba , @xmath10cs and @xmath11bi , appear in figures  [ fig : ba133 ] , [ fig : cs137 ] and [ fig : bi207 ] respectively .",
    "the agreement between the geant4 monte carlo simulations and experiment is good for all three sources considered in this work , @xmath9ba , @xmath10cs and @xmath11bi , although for the latter one the normalized @xmath15 of 8.9 is less impressive than for other two . in that case , the energy range , which extended from 80 to 1143  kev , was much greater than for the other too . this may be partly responsible for the higher @xmath15 but another possibility is that our simple linear extrapolation of the results in ref .",
    "@xcite does not fully describe our system s response function at low energies .",
    "if in fact the peak resolution were somewhat worse than this extrapolation indicates  a not unreasonable possibility  then the agreement with experiment would be considerably improved .",
    "it is also worth noting that the slight non - allignment in peak positions , which is evident in all three spectra , can be explained by possible small non - linearities in the experimental energy response .    since the amplifier gain and photomultiplier high voltage were kept the same for all three measurements , the fitted slopes and offsets obtained for all three spectra should have been very nearly the same . in fact",
    "they were , but , as a quantitative measure of consistency , we took the average values for the slope and offset , and again evaluated the normalized @xmath15 for the comparison between experiment and simulation .",
    "the new values for the normalized @xmath15 were , of course , somewhat increased , being 3.6 , 9.5 , and 16.3 for @xmath9ba , @xmath11bi , and @xmath10cs , respectively , but the agreement is still quite satisfactory .",

    "1143  kev is 8.9.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    as stated in the introduction , the result of the simulation that matters most to us is how well it reproduces the fraction of the total @xmath0 spectrum that lies above some low - energy threshold , typically around 80  kev .",
    "the spectral details at higher energy are only important to us to the extent that they change the fraction of counts recorded above threshold .",
    "the fact that the fits performed with the low - energy threshold as a free parameter give the same result for all three isotopes , serves as important assurance that the fitted threshold value is consistent with the actual one .",
    "although the activity of the radioactive sources that we used for this work are nominally 1  @xmath13ci ( 37-kbq ) , the accuracy of this value was only quoted to and approximate @xmath1815% by the supplier .",
    "so that we could get a more precise value for our @xmath0-detector efficiency , we made our own measurement of the @xmath11bi source activity using a well - calibrated hpge @xmath3-detector  @xcite to detect the known @xmath3 rays from the decay .",
    "in this way we established the source activity to be 1.31(1 )  @xmath13ci at 16 january , 2008 .",
    "now , knowing the activity of the source as well as the low - energy detection threshold already obtained from our fit , we could deduce from our experimental data the absolute efficiency of the @xmath0-detector to be 3.48(2)% at the distance of 13.2(1 )  mm . with exactly this geometry",
    ", the geant4 simulation yielded an absolute efficiency of 3.50(1)% , in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "the electron spectra we have obtained from monte carlo simulations are generally in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "all identifiable features that are present in the experimental spectra are reproduced in the simulated ones , and in most cases their relative intensities agree as well .",
    "furthermore , the threshold energy and absolute efficiency are well reproduced .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that geant4 version  4.9.0 can be used effectively to simulate the @xmath0-spectra as measured by our thin plastic scintillator detector .    in particular for our application , where we need only rely on the simulation to determine the energy dependence of the @xmath0-detector s total efficiency with a low - energy threshold at @xmath880  kev , it is clear that geant4 will provide the precision we require .",
    "however , we have also shown that the radioactive - decay module included in geant4 to simulate the initial radiation from a radioactive source should only be used with care : it is essential to check its output carefully . in particular , the intensities of conversion - electron lines produced by this module were sometimes found to be incorrect and , if any forbidden @xmath0-decay branches are involved , their spectrum shapes may not be correctly generated ."
