    "neutron stars ( ns ) are known to be born after the core collapse of supernovae explosions .",
    "after its birth the ns has cooled below 10@xmath0 k and a solid crust is supposed to be formed in the outermost layers . even if the crust contains only a small part of the star",
    ", it plays an important role in its evolution .",
    "indeed , the properties of the crust , notably the transport properties , can strongly influence processes like cooling , accretion and x - ray bursts .",
    "+ heavy ions and the crust of ns share basic many - body aspects due to the fact that they are made of interacting nucleons . having more neutrons than protons ,",
    "many physical properties of both kind of objects are related with the asymmetry dependence of the nuclear interaction .",
    "+ in this work we were interested in dynamical aspects of ns crusts , in particular , with the occurrence of exotic structures . in that region , at densities just below the saturation value , the nuclear matter is said to be `` frustrated '' : subjected to the competition of the short - range nuclear attraction and the long - range coulomb repulsion . as a consequence of this competition nuclei",
    "may organize forming non - spherical composites .",
    "structures such as rod - like and slab - like nuclei , the so called nuclear `` pasta '' , were initially predicted to exist in the ground state of nuclear matter at subnuclear densities by static approaches @xcite . assuming well defined symmetries , these models suggested the appearance of these structures in a well defined order from spherical to cylindrical , planar , complex structures and finally to uniform matter , with increasing density .",
    "this typical sorting of structures was confirmed by recent works @xcite and suggested that pasta phases can be formed in the cooling process of hot ns and during the compression stages taking place during the collapse of supernova cores @xcite . in both cases",
    "it is worthwhile to give a dynamical description of pasta formation .",
    "the interest in structural phases in ns crusts is double .",
    "on one side , their existence may have various astrophysical consequences .",
    "their presence can influence the scattering of neutrinos and modify the neutrino trapping with the corresponding consequences on the processes of supernova core collapse or ns cooling .",
    "another aspect which can be sensitive to pasta formation are the elastic properties of the star ( namely those phenomena depending on the crust - core boundary properties ) which may influence gravitational wave radiation . on the other side , from the nuclear physics point of view",
    ", their formation can be connected with fragment formation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "these phenomena share many aspects since they are both driven by volume , coulomb and surface energies . in particular , the sensitivity to the nuclear equation of state has been suggested @xcite as in cluster formation .    in this work",
    "we present a model describing the dynamics of nuclear matter in the crust of a ns .",
    "it is an extension of a dynamical approach initially developed in order to describe heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the many previous studies employing static frameworks , this model allows to simulate the dynamical processes in inhomogeneous nuclear matter using a large number of nucleons without any assumptions on the structure of nuclear matter .",
    "since these structures involve a large number of low energy configurations , in this work a pure mean field description of the nuclear dynamics has been performed . in this approach , starting from initial crystalline lattices of nuclei , with different symmetries , non spherical structures occur as the result of microscopic self - organization processes .",
    "the survival of those meta - stable equilibrium structures has been checked over thousands fm / c @xcite . in this work",
    ", the influence of the equation of state ( eos ) , of the isotopic compositions and of the lattice perturbations on the formation of exotic structures are sudied .",
    "this contribution is organized as follows . in section 2 the bases of the model",
    "are presented . in section 3",
    "we analyze the occurence of structures in oxygen lattices with different isotopic composition .",
    "the effects of the eos and the response to lattice perturbation are discussed . in section 4",
    "our concluding remarks are given .",
    "at temperatures @xmath1 1 mev and densities between 10@xmath2g/@xmath3 at the surface to 3@xmath4g/@xmath3 at the interface with the core , the stellar matter can be modelled by a neutral mixture of nuclei , electrons and free neutrons .",
    "nuclei are expected to form a crystalline lattice immersed in a degenerate relativistic gas of electrons , which may be described by a uniform density distribution @xcite . in order to describe the microscopic dynamics of the nuclear many - body system",
    "we have developed a dynamical approach , which is based on the dywan model @xcite for heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies .",
    "this approach essentially gives a prescription for solving an extended time - dependent hartree - fock ( etdhf ) equation for the one - body density matrix , of the form : @xmath5 + \\mathcal{k}(\\rho).\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the one - body density matrix , @xmath7 is the one - body hamiltonian and @xmath8 is the collision term , providing the irreversible evolution of the system due to the coupling of @xmath6 with higher order multiparticle correlations . in the present calculations we are essentially concerned with low energy configurations of the system .",
    "we will suppose that transitions towards excited single particle states are inhibited and that the dynamics is mainly governed by the mean field .",
    "equation ( [ etdhf ] ) , with @xmath9=0 , is solved by projection of the one body space of states onto a convenient basis.these functions are splines @xcite , a particular case of wavelets , which are mathematical ( non analytical ) objects with many interesting properties and which behave like a moving basis .    in a first step , a static hartree - fock ( hf ) self - consistent procedure",
    "is implemented in order to get nuclear composites either in their ground states or in excited states according to mechanical or thermal constraints . with these nuclei , prepared in a single wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell , a super - cell",
    "is constructed by stacking unitary cells in three dimensions .",
    "their number and symmetries are different depending on the kind of lattice we are interested in .",
    "the complete three - dimensional lattice is built up from the super - cell under periodic boundary conditions . in this work simple cubic cells ( scc )",
    "have been considered , but other symmetries can be arbitrarily chosen .    for this calculation we have chosen , for simplicity , a density - dependent zero - range effective interaction , with the following self - consistent field : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for neutron and proton densities , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15=1/2 for neutrons and -1/2 for protons , @xmath16=0.145 @xmath17 is the saturation density of infinite nuclear matter and @xmath18 is the coulomb potential .",
    "the calculation of @xmath18 is performed using the ewald summation techniques @xcite , which is adapted to the calculation of long range potentials in periodic systems .",
    "it consists basically in recasting the coulomb potential into two convenient terms , each one of them can be calculated in a fast and efficient way @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the force are related with those corresponding to the usual skyrme force , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , by the following relationships : @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25=1/6 , and : @xmath26    the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 are related to the coefficients of the mass formula @xmath29 and @xmath30 corresponding to , respectively , the volume - symmetry and to the density - dependent symmetry energy as follows : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 is the kinetic energy contribution to @xmath30 .",
    "these parameters are still uncertain because they are not completely constrained from nuclear data , then a study of their influence on the overall dynamics seems necessary . in this work",
    "@xmath27 has been fixed to 20 mev and @xmath28 varied in the range -125 and -75 mev in order to analyze the sensitivity of the dynamics to this interaction .",
    "the density dependence of the symmetry energy has been determined here in a phenomenological way according to its current estimate at the saturation value in pure neutron matter .",

    "[ diagram ] the stiffer force , corresponding to @xmath28=-75 mev , is shown to favour the occurrence of spherical and sponge - like structures , while restraining the appearance of cylinder and slabs .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in the stiff case the potential is more repulsive , namely at high mean densities .",
    "the consequence is that more and more neutrons are dripped or localized at the surface . in the last case ,",
    "quasi - free neutrons contribute either to build heavy spherical nuclei or to link neighbouring clusters is all directions , giving rise to the so - called sponge - like structures .",
    "as underlined by other authors @xcite the inner crust of a neutron star is an extremely complex system in which the appearance of disordered phases can be favored .",
    "there is a special interest to investigate how nuclear matter , for a given proton fraction , self - organizes dynamically with the introduction of slight perturbations of the initial conditions . in order to study the feasibility of those disordered phases",

    ", width=302 ]    starting from similar initial conditions the system evolves towards unlike configurations depending on their corresponding proton fraction . in the symmetric case the system organizes in several intermediate mass clusters , while in the asymmetric case it evolves towards a unique massive cluster occupying the entire supercell . in any case",
    ", a gradual loss of the initial symmetries is observed in both pictures . from an ordered array of regular deformed nuclei",
    "the system goes through a heterogeneous configuration of clusters with different masses and shapes .",
    "it is worthwhile to underline that in ref .",
    "@xcite the model has been shown to be extremely well conditioned , conserving metastable configurations during time intervals of several thousands of fm / c .",
    "this fact permitted to check the corresponding numerical accuracy and reject possible numerical instabilities .",
    "the small initial perturbations then generate sufficiently strong density fluctuations so as to provoke a different rearrangement of matter molding heavy aggregates .",
    "the fact that at lower proton fraction a single ( infinite ) aggregate occurs can be interpreted as a consequence of the increase of neutron wave functions diffusivity .",
    "this is a direct consequence of wavelet spreading which results from the dynamical evolution . indeed , as the proton fraction decreases , the number of dripped neutron increases and nucleons become more delocalized with significant overlap in configuration space .",
    "the competition between nuclear and coulomb interactions , which is local , covers broader spatial regions in this case .",
    "in this work we present a non dissipative , self - consistent , dynamical description of nuclear matter in conditions of density and temperature similar to those which should exist in the outermost layers of neutron stars .",
    "+ in this description the small excitation energy which is initially deposited in deformation allows the system to explore a landscape of structures .",
    "the occurrence of most probable shapes is analyzed by means of structure diagrams in the threshold density versus mean density plane . not only the ordered five standard types of pasta emerge naturally but also other intermediate shapes between them which can be characterized through morphological analysis techniques .",
    "+ phase diagrams are shown to be sensitive to a variation in the intensity of the isovector part of the self - consistent potential .",
    "the observed trend is the increase of spherical or sponge - like structures with the stiffness of the force .",
    "+ in the present pure mean - field description lattice symmetries are preserved along the temporal evolution of the system . in all cases ,",
    "the effects of perturbing the initial lattice is to break those symmetries .",

    "symmetric systems organize in several intermediate mass structures , while asymmetric ones collapse in a unique massive cluster occupying the entire supercell .    in this work",
    "a simple phenomenological local potential has been implemented .",
    "the formation and transitions between the observed non - equilibrium structures can be strongly modified using more complex non - local effective forces and beyond a pure mean - field description .",
