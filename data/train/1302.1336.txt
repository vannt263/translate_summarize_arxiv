    "the definition of moment matrices as given in the main text naturally extend to this @xmath122-party scenario by applying a local cp map @xmath146 to each subsystem @xmath147 , i.e. , @xmath148 = \\otimes_{s=1}^n \\lambda_s [ \\rho]$ ] . by the local structure of this transformation one",

    "in this part we present some additional information on the examples mentioned in the main text and their respective negativity bounds .    first note that any explicit quantum state @xmath161 which attains a certain value @xmath162 of a bell inequality @xmath163 provides an upper bound on the minimal negativity compatible with this violation , i.e. , @xmath164=\\min n[\\rho\\,|\\,i\\cdot p = v]\\leq n[\\rho_0]$ ] . furthermore , since the negativity is convex and invariant by adding local auxiliary states , the minimal negativity is a convex function in the amount of violation @xmath162 , that we shall denote by @xmath165 $ ] .",

    "because the negativity of any @xmath183 state is upper bounded by @xmath184 for all @xmath185 , this certifies that such violations are achievable only with both local hilbert space dimension @xmath93 , or , in other words , that @xmath94 serves as a dimension witness  @xcite for qutrits .",

    "similar to @xmath172 we observe that the negativity crosses @xmath184 at a violation of @xmath96 , therefore a larger quantum violation shows that the underlying state is again at least 3-dimensional . for this inequality",
    "it is furthermore interesting that for the maximal violation at @xmath187 , our numerical optimization gives a negativity bound that differs from that of the optimal , non - maximally entangled state  @xcite @xmath188 by less than @xmath189 .",
    "+    in the multipartite case the amount of genuine negativity necessary to achieve different violations of the @xmath118 and @xmath119 diews were computed according to eq .  . for biseparable states these expressions",

    "we refer to partial levels such as level @xmath110 to denote moment matrices @xmath14 which were constructed with all terms involving @xmath46-fold products of local measurement operators , as well as some @xmath48-fold ones . similarly to the chsh and @xmath172 inequalities , the plot for the svetlichny inequality @xmath118 at level @xmath174 is a straight line up to numerical precision . since the value @xmath192 is achievable with a three - qubit ghz state with genuine negativity @xmath156=1/2 $ ] , we obtain the following tight bound for the minimal genuine negativity compatible with a svetlichny inequality violation , @xmath193 \\geq ( v-4)/(8\\sqrt{2}-8)$ ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : bell2negativity3 ] we also note that no violation of these diew is possible with ppt mixtures ; hence the bound for biseparable states coincides with the one for ppt mixtures . since any diew with this property",
    "can be found by using eq .",

    "@xcite . furthermore ,",
    "as pointed out in the main text , since any three qubit state of the w - class  @xcite satisfies   is convex , this optimization can be performed over pure three - qubit states @xmath194 of the @xmath120-class .",
    "note that the genuine negativity of a pure state is just the minimum bipartite negativity for all bipartitions @xmath145 . because @xmath195 is furthermore invariant under local basis changes one can employ the @xmath196-equivalent standard form of a pure three - qubit state of the @xmath120-class  @xcite , which leaves a straightforward optimization .",

    "@xmath197 , our result shows that violations @xmath198 and @xmath199 of the @xmath118 and @xmath119 inequalities can never be obtained by any such three - qubit states .",

    "@xcite .    at last",

    "this perspective was triggered by the npa hierarchy ( or using also the modified moment matrix ) to compute standard tsirelson bounds .",
    "although this method is only guaranteed to be complete in the limit of an infinite number of moments , it is important to stress that there are many known instances where one could stop the hierarchy already earlier , since one has already reached the true tsirelson bound .",
    "this is certified by a special rank property of the solution  @xcite and means that the bound does not improve further even if one includes higher moments .",
    "however , in all our considered non - trivial ppt examples the respective bounds sharpened if we considered higher levels .",
    "in this section we show that the underlying quantum state and measurement operators can generally be assumed to be real when considering the device - independent quantification of entanglement in terms of ( genuine ) negativity , i.e. , there exists an equivalent real construction having the same ( or less ) amount of ( genuine ) negativity .",
    "this extends the result of ref .",
    "@xcite which already proves that probability distributions arising from quantum theory in a bell - type experiment can always be reproduced using only real states and real measurement operators .",
