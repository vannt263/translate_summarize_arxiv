    "the term `` cometary knot '' is used to refer to structures that include both an elliptical head and a trailing tail ( although both these structures come in a variety of shapes ) .",

    "however , some tails first narrow then widen with distance from the bright tip , such as knot ( h ) in fig.[fig - indivisual ] .",

    "the orientation of the tail often changes at the secondary peak ( a ) and ( f ) .",
    "as the secondary peak is aligned with the tail , and no crescent is found nearby , the secondary peak is physically associated with the primary peak .",
    "the wide variety of tails may be linked with the formation mechanisms of knots and tails , or they trace an interaction with the local environment . this will be discussed in sect.[shaping ] .",

    "the difference is caused by the assumed knot number densities in the inner ring ; @xcite used a lower number density ( 148 arcmin@xmath25 ) throughout the entire nebula based on observations of the outer ring .",
    "we counted knot number densities in relatively less crowded regions within our image so as to minimize confusion problems . despite that",

    "this estimate is a factor six larger than the molecular mass estimated from co observations @xcite .",
    "the difference could be due to the large fluctuations of knot mass . since the ionized gas mass is estimated as 0.3m@xmath28 in this nebula @xcite , a substantial amount of molecular gas remains .",
    "most of the h@xmath2 gas is found in the outer ring , thus the distance from the cs , i.e. uv radiation strength is a key .",

    "the f656n data at 656 nm are dominated by h@xmath22 with some contamination from [ nii ] , whereas the f658n data at 658 nm are dominated by [ nii ] , with negligible contamination from h@xmath22 .",

    "in the outer ring , diffuse [ nii ] components are relatively weak , and in the inner edge , all of the knots are isolated .",
    "this contrast can be explained if ngc7293 takes the morphology of a pole - on bipolar nebula projected onto two rings @xcite .",

    "h@xmath2 is associated only with high density knots , whereas the ionized gas is located both at the surface of the knots and in the inter - knot space .",
    "the high density of the knots leads to high brightness in the knot locations for h@xmath2 and to a lesser extent , h@xmath22 .",

    "@xcite reported a displacement of the [ nii ] tips with respect to those in nicmos h@xmath22 and h@xmath2 by @xmath70.1@xmath4 : this displacement is minor compared to our 0.4@xmath4 resolution . all knots except ( b )",
    "were detected in [ nii ] , but only three were found in h@xmath22 .",
    "all crescents are found in all three wavelengths .",
    "the secondary peaks in knots ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( f ) are also found in all wavelength images : fainter local peaks in the h@xmath2 image of knot ( f ) can be seen in the h@xmath22 image , but not in the [ nii ] image . in the [ nii ] and h@xmath22 images , high emission from the inter - knot region is found . due to this high inter - knot emission and faintness of tail emission , the narrowing of the tails is not always clearly seen in the [ nii ] image .",
    "our observations show that at the inner edge and the adjacent regions of the nebula , the h@xmath2 is found only in knots . in the outer ring",
    "there is a faint dispersed h@xmath2 component which can be interpreted as overlapping blended tails .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the h@xmath2 is associated solely with the knots , following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are two plausible explanations for such an association : ( i ) the large optical depth of the knots protects previously formed h@xmath2 from the harsh uv radiation , or ( ii ) the h@xmath2 formed in - situ in the knots , where high densities and low temperatures allow for molecule formation .",
    "the choice between these two explanations is linked to the origin of the knots : did these form at late times , after ionization of the planetary nebulae began ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or did they originate in a molecular wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the first case , h@xmath2 must have formed in - situ , while in the second case the molecular content may have survived from the agb wind .    in order to test whether h@xmath2 formed during the agb phase",
    "could have survived into the pn phase , we have investigated the lifetime of molecular hydrogen . using the dissociation rate of h@xmath2 , including self - shielding @xcite and @xmath29 and @xmath30@xmath31 @xcite , the time scale to dissociate h@xmath2",
    "is estimated to be @xmath32years .",
    "thus , pre - existing h@xmath2 can survive in dense regions within the current conditions . however , the uv radiation field will have been much stronger in the past .",
    "the star is currently on the cooling track , and is much less luminous than during its earlier post - agb evolution . if @xmath33 , the dissociation time scale is @xmath34years . the high - luminosity regime phase for relatively massive stars lasts for less than 10,000yrs @xcite .",
    "hence , the h@xmath2 associated with knots may have survived such an intense uv radiation field for this early post - agb period .    in order to investigate whether h@xmath2 can be formed in - situ in pne , @xcite calculated h@xmath2 formation in ( partly ) ionised gas .",
    "the reactions involved include h@xmath35+h and h@xmath36+h . the h@xmath2 formation rate in the ionized gas is estimated to be 10@xmath37@xmath31s@xmath12 in total , which is slightly larger than the h@xmath2 destruction rate . however , the fraction of h@xmath2 with respect to h is extremely small ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "@xcite concluded that some h@xmath2 could survive the ionized state , but it is not yet clear if h@xmath2 can be formed from the ionized gas during the pn phase .",
    "the densities within the knots are estimated to be @xmath39 @xcite to @xmath40 @xcite . at @xmath39 ,",
    "h@xmath2 formation on dust grains becomes significant ; the time scale is of the order of @xmath41 .",
    "thus , in the densest knots the formation can proceed faster than the age of the nebula .",
    "however , if the densities are lower , the required life time of the knots becomes similar to the age of the nebula .",
    "in such a case , the knots pre - date the ionization , removing the need to ( re-)form the h@xmath2 later .    in summary ,",
    "the time scale suggest that part of the h@xmath2 is primordial , i.e. formed during the agb phase , and survived the ionization of the nebula . in dense knots ,",
    "( re-)formation of h@xmath2 is possible .",
    "there have been various suggested mechanisms for knot formation .",
    "the two main scenarios are : ( 1 ) the knots are primordial density enhancements , i.e. they started their formation during the agb phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 2 ) the knots form in situ , as a result of the onset of the pn phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the in - situ formation mechanisms can be further divided into subcategories : ( i ) turbulent ( rayleigh - taylor ; rt ) instabilities as a result of interaction between the slow and fast winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( ii ) turbulent ( rayleigh - taylor ; rt ) instabilities at the ionization front ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( iii ) shadowing effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( iv ) radiative shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite used his model to predict the mass ( @xmath42m@xmath43 ) and number of knots ( @xmath44 ) in a nebula , consistent with current observations .",
    "a pre - ionization origin of the knots appears to be plausible .",
    "the system of knots has an expansion velocity which is typical for agb winds but is less than that of the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "the last point suggests that the knots formed after the agb wind reached its terminal velocity ( at @xmath45au from the star ) , but before the overpressure from the onset of ionization caused further acceleration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that a very high fraction of the total mass is found in the knots , also is more easily reconciled with an early origin .    to form knots in an expanding wind",
    "requires compression of the gas , within an overpressured ( heated ) surrounding region .",
    "this may happen at the ionization front , as discussed above . because the ionization front moves outward",
    ", the inner sets of knots would be older than the outer knots , in this model .",
    "the shock front between the fast and slow wind is another option but this front co - moves with the expanding nebula , so that one might expect the knots to be found only near the inner edge of the dense nebula .",
    "this interface is located within the ionized region , so that one may expect the knots to share the velocity with the ionized gas .",
    "this model can not be entirely excluded but may be less in agreement with the observations . in this case , the h@xmath2 would have to form from ionized gas . in either of these cases , the knots would be a very common phenomenon in planetary nebulae .",
    "to form the knots much earlier , in the agb wind , would require a denser region than normally expected in agb winds .",
    "however , if the agb star has a close binary companion , a spiral shock will form in the agb wind behind the companion @xcite .",
    "this shock causes a heated , compressed region , which a large fraction of the agb ejecta pass through . this could provide a possible location for the origin of the knots . in the absence of detailed hydrodynamical models , this must remain speculative . in this model ,",
    "the outer knots are older than the inner knots .",
    "the problem of distinguishing between formation mechanisms becomes even more difficult once we consider the shaping of the knot heads and tails .",
    "most recent studies of knot shapes assume a pre - existing density enhancement and do not consider whether it is primordial or formed during the pn phase .",
    "consequently , observations of knot ( head and tail ) shapes , may be able to distinguish between shaping models , but are unlikely to reveal the origin of the original density enhancement .",
    "the shaping mechanisms can be also classified into three basic categories , with some cross - fertilization : ( a ) hydrodynamic interaction between winds and density enhancements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( b ) interaction ( including photoevaporation ) of material with ionizing ( uv ) radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( c ) the effect of shadowing by density enhancements ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these mechanisms may act together , and disentangling which mechanisms are mutually consistent and which are mutually inconsistent is a challenge . in the following , we will first discuss streaming models , followed by photo - evaporation and shadowing models .",
    "a combination is proposed based on the observational constraints .    in all cases",
    "discuss below we use the term `` core '' to describe the density enhancement which is acted upon by the various mechanisms to create cometary knot shapes ( heads and tails ) .",
    "the first proposed mechanism was the interaction of a core with a wind ( which may emanate from the cs or be caused by expansion of the inter - knot gas ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this basic concept was also the inspiration for @xcite , who showed that by including an evolution in the fast wind , small clumpy structures could be formed , but the resulting shapes are not described . a more recent attempt to modify this concept includes both an ambient wind , which can be sub- or supersonic , and a flow from the core itself , where flow is assumed to have a constant ablation .",
    "we call this a ` stream ' model .",
    "the wind is due to the differential velocity between the diffuse gas and the knots : there is no evidence for a hot wind from the central star .",
    "the interaction between the core and the wind can create both the heads and the tails @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the crescent tip is a bow - shock ( ignoring photo - ionization ) and ram pressure creates a narrowing tail for subsonic ambient winds @xcite and a widening tail for supersonic ambient winds .",
    "the second option , i.e. interaction of material with ionizing ( uv ) radiation , considers photo - ionization and photo - evaporation models , ignoring streaming motions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the surface of a core facing the cs is illuminated by uv radiation , which causes heating and photo - evaporation from the core , and creates the crescent tip . at this moment , there is no detailed hydrodynamical model present to reproduce narrowing , widening and meandering tails , using photo - evaporation .",
    "@xcite calculated ionization front instabilities , and obtained a jet shape .",
    "no clear resemblance is found yet between the modelled shape and the knots observed in the helix nebula , however , the explored parameter space was limited .",
    "the final possibility is the shadowing by density enhancement @xcite , leading to non - ionized regions in the shadow . here",
    ", the knots can trace a large core , consisting of neutral gas and dust , with a bright sunny side and a dark shadow giving rise to the tail .",
    "uv photons from the cs do not reach the shadowed side directly , but diffuse uv radiation diffusion illuminates the tail . to explain narrowing tail @xcite and widening tail @xcite , varying angles of illumination are used .",
    "the tails can be explained either with streaming motion , by interaction at the ionization front or by shadowing . here",
    "the streaming models or ionization models appear better able to fit the available data .",
    "the bright ( and well - isolated ) inner knot located in our field , shows clear acceleration in [ nii ] along the tail @xcite , by about 10kms@xmath12 .",
    "the meandering tails are consistent with instabilities expected for streaming motions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or interaction at ionization front @xcite , whilst solely shadowing by density enhancement requires straight tails by necessity .",
    "( in some case ionization edges are visible within the tails . ) finally , the absence of clear tails in the outer regions is less easily explained with shadowing .",
    "the issue is controversial , and further velocity information would be required to resolve it .    as mentioned before , the knots change appreciably in appearance between the inner and outer nebula . in the inner nebula",
    ", tails are always seen . in the outer nebula ,",
    "the knots appear more diffuse and tails are absent .",
    "this implies a change in shaping mechanism . whereas streaming motions appear important in the inner region , the structures in the outer nebula suggest that it does not play a role there . within the streaming model",
    ", the implication is that the knots have a differential velocity with respect to the ambient medium in the inner nebula , but not or less so in the outer nebula .",
    "a plausible model is that the inner knots system is being overrun by faster expanding , lower density gas , but that this has not yet reached the outer knot system .",
    "@xcite find a difference in expansion velocity between the system of knots and the ionized gas , of 17kms@xmath12 , with the knots moving slower .",
    "the wind speed in the nebula shows significant variations , with velocities up to 50kms@xmath12 with respect to the nebula mean velocity @xcite .",
    "the sound speed in the ionized nebula is of the order of 10kms@xmath12 .",
    "this is similar to the velocity differential : we may expect both sub - sonic and super - sonic winds , depending on the local conditions and on the flow velocity within the tail .    if the gas flow models are correct , it points to the prevalent wind interaction being subsonic , because of the common presence of narrowing tails . however , there are also cases of widening tails ( knot f ) , which requires supersonic winds",
    ". it would be of interest to measure detailed velocity fields for the tails and the surrounding gas .",
    "the tail velocities may possibly be measured from the h@xmath2 lines .",
    "some of the more complicated tail structures may be due to feedback , where an ambient wind is disturbed by another knot .",
    "the multiple brightness - peaks and meandering tail in a knot ( fig.[fig - indivisual ] ) may be explained through the complex interaction between nearby cores @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig - indivisual ] shows that some knots have a dip in brightness in the middle of the tail which remains unexplained .",
    "if this is due to the pressure balance , the temperature would be lowest at this point and increase again further out ( related to the shadowing by the knot ) .",
    "it could also be due to a change to a supersonic flow at this point @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of temperature and velocity distribution along these tails may help distinguish the various models , in so far impossible .",
    "it does not appear possible to view the three models in isolation .",
    "in reality , a combination of effects is likely required .",
    "streaming motions can help explain the shapes , but the observed structures implies that streaming motions only occur in the inner nebula , not the outer .",
    "the crescent shapes trace photo - ionization , and photo - evaporation .",
    "shadowing will occur , but its importance to the shaping remains to be proven .",
    "integrated models taken all effects into account would be desirable .",
    "we have obtained a wide field view image of the helix nebula in excellent seeing conditions .",
    "knots are found throughout the inner edge to the outer ring , and h@xmath2 is always associated with knots .",
    "chemical and pdr models do not favour h@xmath2 formation in the ionized and neutral gas in planetary nebulae , suggesting that the observed h@xmath2 gas is a remnant of molecular gas formed during the agb phase .",
    "the moircs image shows that knots come in a variety of shapes .",
    "these various knot morphologies suggest that the inner knots are being overrun , and shaped by , a faster wind .",
    "however , such a wind would not yet have reached the outer system of knots , .",
    "we appreciate technical support from the subaru telescope staff during the observations .",
