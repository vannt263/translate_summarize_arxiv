    "originally , the transversity parton distribution @xmath1 are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . ] was defined by ralston and soper @xcite . however , only after polarized targets were developped and first spin - experiments yielded very interesting results , transverse spin structure functions became a real issue .",
    "after the `` rediscovery '' of @xmath1 by artru and mekhfi @xcite in 1990 the topic of transverse spin has gained an increasing amount of attention by elementary particle physicists .",
    "much of the interest is caused by the fact that besides the well known unpolarized and helicity weighted parton distributions @xmath7 and @xmath2 the transversity distribution @xmath1 is the only twist-2 distribution of the nucleon .",
    "on the other hand , its special chirality selection rules prevent its measurement at leading order in polarized _ inclusive _ deep inelastic lepton  proton scattering experiments and therefore no experimental data on @xmath1 is available up to now .",
    "this situation is expected to change in the near future , when the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory will be able to scatter transversely polarized protons with high cm energy , luminosity , and large polarization of each beam .",
    "one of the proposed experiments for the rhic spin program is the measurement of the transverse double spin asymmetry @xmath8 using the drell  yan process @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 denotes the flavour and @xmath11 an electron - positron or muon pair . here",
    ", the asymmetry is not suppressed because the two quark lines in the unitarity diagram are independent of each other @xcite .",
    "this also holds for other partonic processes , like the prompt photon production with an away - side jet @xmath12 , or two - jet production @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "nonetheless , these reactions are not very useful for extracting information about the transversity distribution , since either the partonic part of the asymmetry is small or the cross section of other contributing background processes is much larger @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed , that at some low scale @xmath15 the transversity distribution is similar to the helicity distribution @xmath16 and that their difference is only due to dynamic effects @xcite .",
    "crude analytical estimates which were based on this assumption yielded @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "however , in these model calculations the correct @xmath18evolution of @xmath1 was not taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we present a new estimate of the transverse double spin asymmetry of the drell - yan process based on ( [ assumption ] ) using the new mc simulation program sphinx tt .",
    "we take into account the correct @xmath18evolution and give a crude estimate for the qcd corrections to the simple drell - yan model .    in section",
    "[ 2 ] we describe the model we used for our calculations .",
    "section  [ 3 ] contains a short description of sphinx tt .",
    "our results and conclusions are presented in section  [ 4 ] .",
    "in order to be able to make an estimate of @xmath0 we assume that the transversity weighted distribution of quarks and antiquarks equals the helicity weighted distribution at the low scale @xmath19  gev@xmath20 : @xmath21 this is rather an ad  hoc assumption .",
    "transversity distributions and helicity distributions should agree for some very small @xmath18 , where perturbative qcd is not applicable .",
    "it is not clear how much they will differ after evolution up to 4  gev@xmath20 . their dglap equations differ most notably because the transversity distribution is not a singlett with respect to chirality and therefore does not couple to gluons .",
    "its evolution equation reads simply @xmath22 the splitting function @xmath23 $ ] was calculated by artru and mekhfi @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ glap ] ) implies for the anomalous dimensions    @xmath24    since @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 all momenta of the transversity distribution decrease and the distribution becomes softer with increasing @xmath18 .",
    "we used the leading - order parametrizations set  c of gehrmann / stirling @xcite , and bartelski / tatur @xcite and evolved them according to ( [ glap ] ) .",
    "the authors of all major previous works @xcite about the transverse double spin asymmetry of lepton pair production only considered the simple electromagnetic graph @xmath28 which yields the hadronic double spin asymmetry @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the polar and azimuthal angles of the lepton momentum in the dilepton rest frame with respect to the beam and spin axis , resp .",
    "however , it is well known that the cross section of the qcd corrections at @xmath32 is approximately as large as the one of the drell - yan graph resulting in a @xmath33-factor of @xmath34 since this bremsstrahlung graphs might carry asymmetries completely different to ( [ asydy ] ) one should have a closer look at them .",
    "in general , one would expect the analytical expressions for these asymmetries to be more complicated than ( [ asydy ] ) since one more outgoing parton is involved here .",
    "so it would be nice , if one could seperate the drell - yan graph from its qcd corrections kinematically .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath35 of the virtual photon produced in the drell - yan model is of the order of 1 gev since the quark and antiquark possess a primordial transverse momentum in the proton of the order of several hundred mev .",
    "contrarily , the virtual photon in the qcd - compton and qcd - annihilation process can also posses a large transverse momentum , which is balanced by the large opposite transverse momentum of the additional outgoing parton . in case the transverse momentum of the virtual photon in the qcd annihilation or",
    "compton process is small , the reaction is characterized by three scales , namely @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . here , the differential cross section is dominated by double - leading - logarithmic contributions @xmath39\\ ] ] where the @xmath40 are constants .",
    "the true expansion parameter is rather @xmath41 than @xmath42 .",
    "equation ( [ lla ] ) describes the radiation of an infinite number of soft gluons from the partons which enter the hard partonic reaction .",
    "fortunately the coefficients @xmath40 are not independent of each other but exponentiate @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath43 at double - logarithmic precision differs from the one calculated by a naive convolution only by a form factor @xmath44 for the qcd - annihilation process and @xmath45 for the qcd - compton process where @xcite @xmath46 these form factors make ( render ) the differential cross sections finite at @xmath47 .",
    "according to @xcite they also contain the virtual corrections .",
    "if we assume , that the partons inside the proton contain an intrinsic transverse momentum which is distributed according to a gaussian @xmath48 with @xmath49 then the theoretical predictions describe the data well @xcite .",
    "this value is perhaps somewhat high , as deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering experiments suggest a smaller value of about @xmath50 .",
    "actually , the double - logarithmic approximation ( dla ) does not represent the `` state of the art '' .",
    "if one incorporates sub - leading terms @xcite then primordial momentum is not needed to describe the data .",
    "this implies that the contribution from the drell - yan graph vanishes because @xmath51 at @xmath47 and the resulting shape of the @xmath32 contributions is rather changed .",
    "such an approach would go beyond the present calculations and would be required if our calculations suggested a statistical accuracy to be expected from the planned rhic experiments ( which they do not ) .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to the dla for the calculation of the event rates although strictly speaking it is not valid for all values of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "after having clarified the situation for the unpolarized cross section we want to consider polarized scattering now . transverse spin asymmetries manifest themselves in a nontrivial distribution of the azimuth of the outgoing leptons ( see ( [ asydy ] ) ) . their origin can be easily understood .",
    "the axis of the incoming momenta in the cm frame and the spin axis define one plane in space .",
    "the orientation of the second one , defined by the momenta of the outgoing leptons and the ones of the entering partons , is therefore not arbitrary .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a shows the situation of the unpolarized qcd - annihilation graph which is similar to the previous one . the orientation of the second plane in relation to that of the first one is not arbitrary again .",
    "the major difference to the previous case is that the first plane , defined by the momenta of the incoming partons and the gluon , now is not fixed in space because the azimuth of the gluon momentum is not fixed .",
    "the same situation also holds for the qcd  compton process .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation of the resulting angular distributions in qcd is not well understood .",
    "one can try to use only perturbation theory although @xmath35 becomes very small in the region we are interested in , or one can invoke resummation techniques for the small @xmath35 region but neither approach describes the data completely @xcite .    in case the incoming quark and antiquark are transversely polarized , an additional third plane can be defined according to figure  [ fig2]b . here , the orientations of all planes in relation to each other are nontrivial .",
    "the virtual photon and the gluon now take on similar roles as the lepton pair in the drell - yan graph since they are the outgoing particles from the first interaction .",
    "this means , that the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the photon momentum and the spin axis shows the typical @xmath52 modulation .",
    "if one of the entering particles is a gluon then the azimuthal angle between the first and the third plane is distributed evenly in the allowed interval , since gluons can not carry an asymmetry . for this reason , the compton graph does not carry a transverse spin asymmetry at all .",
    "we did not make an attempt to calculate the transverse spin asymmetry of the qcd - annihilation process because , as we mentioned above , the angular distributions in the unpolarized case are not well understood .",
    "thus , one might expect to run into similar difficulties in the polarized case .    for practical purposes we therefore made the crude but common assumption , that the transverse asymmetry of the qcd - annihilation graph equals the drell - yan one .",
    "in order to estimate the transverse double spin asymmetry in the framework of our model we developped a new mc program for transversely polarized nucleon - nucleon scattering called sphinx tt .",
    "it is based on the lund monte carlo pythia  5.6 @xcite and is similar to sphinx , a mc code for longitudinal polarized scattering .",
    "important features of sphinx tt are :    * polarization is described correctly in the initial state up to the hard partonic reaction .",
    "the spin orientations are not followed through the final states .",
    "string breaking and hadronization in general are assumed not to depend on the spin orientation . * two sets of polarized parton distributions are available by now .",
    "the parametrizations of @xmath2 by gehrmann / stirling @xcite and bartelski / tatur @xcite are taken as transversity distributions at @xmath53 and are evoluted according to the glap - equation ( [ glap ] ) .",
    "the implementation of other model parametrizations is easy . * transverse polarization",
    "is correctly taken care of in the initial state showering routine .",
    "* the polarized partonic cross sections for high-@xmath54 jet production , prompt photon production and lepton pair production in the drell - yan model are available .",
    "@xmath55 physics is not implemented yet .",
    "* the majority of options of pythia 5.6 is also available for sphinx  tt .",
    "here we present the results of our mc calculations of @xmath0 for the phenix detector at rhic .",
    "our results are presented for @xmath56 and an integrated luminosity of @xmath57 as well as @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this is equivalent to 230 days of beam time with 50% efficiency . the assumed integrated luminosity is larger by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard value as quoted in @xcite but is necessary in order to detect an adequate number of events @xcite .",
    "we assume that both endcaps will have a polar opening angle of @xmath60 with respect to the beam axis and will be able to measure myons with @xmath61 .",
    "the central muon detectors are not very well suited for the measurement of @xmath0 since they do not cover the full azimuth .",
    "mc calculations @xcite indicate competition from charm decay for @xmath62 at @xmath56 and @xmath63 at @xmath58 so that we set the minimum lepton pair mass accordingly . we did not set a cut to exclude the @xmath64 production region at @xmath65 because the cross section decreases exponentially with increasing @xmath66 anyway .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the differential cross section @xmath67 for both cm energies .",
    "the drell - yan graph obviously dominates lepton pair production for low @xmath35 .",
    "the qcd compton graph is the least important reaction in this region . in the high @xmath35 region",
    "we have the opposite situation .",
    "to enhance the drell - yan signal we therefore required @xmath68 .",
    "this leads to an improvement of the @xmath69-factor by @xmath70 for @xmath56 and @xmath71 for @xmath58 in our model .",
    "we multiplied the usual @xmath32-matrix elements of the hard partonic scattering with the corresponding form factors  ( [ ffac ] ) .",
    "afterwards we fitted the width of the intrinsic momentum to the data at @xmath72 taken from @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we got @xmath73 which is very high in comparison to dis experiments . on the other hand we checked that the asymmetry does not depend on @xmath74 for values smaller than 1  gev .",
    "our results are rather independent of the details .",
    "one should also note , that we switched off the general initial state showering routine because it is only suited for the large @xmath35 region and to avoid double counting .",
    "bremsstrahlung effects are only taken into account by the qcd - annihilation and compton process .",
    "figures  [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show the distribution of events in the plane of the bjrken variables of the partons which participate in the hard interaction . generally , the @xmath75-variables at @xmath76 have smaller values as the ones at @xmath56 . in both cases ,",
    "there is one region in the @xmath75-@xmath75-plane where most of the drell - yan type events are situated .",
    "these regions can be characterized by @xmath77 and @xmath78 at @xmath56 , and @xmath79 and @xmath80 at @xmath58 respectively .    fortunately , these ranges are also the ones , where the largest asymmetries are expected since the polaized parton distributions multiplied with @xmath75 have a maximum there . therefore , it would be interesting to restrict the detected events to these regions .",
    "furthermore , the exchange terms in equation  ( [ asydy ] ) would disappear . in order to achieve",
    "this one has to calculate @xmath81 from the lepton momenta .",
    "then one must decide which one of the incoming partons was the quark and which one was the antiquark .",
    "since the majority of events fulfill @xmath82 this criterium can be used very successfully for this purpose . in only 2%-10% of all cases the @xmath75-values",
    "are not assigned correctly .    of course",
    ", it is not possible to reconstruct the @xmath75-values of the incoming partons of the qcd processes because the outgoing quark or gluon jet is not detected .",
    "since the jet momentum is quite small in general we do nt make a big error by using the drell - yan formulas for the reconstruction of the bjrken-@xmath75 also for the qcd processes .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] shows the event rates for the different cases . at @xmath76",
    "they are about ten to twenty times higher than for @xmath56 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the unpolarized parton distributions rise steeply for smaller @xmath75 .",
    "however , according to the shape of the transversity distributions for @xmath58 one should expect a smaller @xmath0 .",
    "so we should try to minimize the statistical errors by integrating over all kinematical variables .",
    "the integration over the azimuth is performed as follows @xcite @xmath83 for @xmath52 this gives simply a factor of 4 . according to our model the qcd annihilation graph carries the same asymmetry as the drell - yan graph which leads to @xmath84        *",
    "if @xmath87 then @xmath0 wo nt be measurable at rhic at @xmath56 because the statistical error is approximately as large as the asymmetry itself .",
    "* at @xmath58 the _ relative _ statistical error is also very large , namely @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , it is very unlikely that the asymmetry can be measured as there will certainly be some unavoidable background and systematic error . *",
    "the main reason for the predicted smallness of the asymmetry is the very small antiquark polarization which is of the order of 5% according to common parametrizations of parton distributions . by assuming a much larger sea polarization one gets larger asymmetries @xcite",
    "consequently , there is a good chance that @xmath0 can be measured at @xmath58 if , e.g. , @xmath89 . *",
    "it is crucial for the experiment that rhic will be able run with the design luminosity in order to have enough events .    when we were writing this article we received @xcite which describes a confinement model calculation of @xmath1 .",
    "the authors also calculate @xmath0 and their results are of the same order as the results presented in this paper .",
