    "while the above studies focus on the destruction of some long - range ordered state ( or at least the associated gap in the electronic spectrum ) by a strong excitation , and emphasize the fast time - scale on which this process happens , there have also been recent experiments on photo - stimulated cuprates , which indicate the emergence of a nonthermal superconducting state which appears to be remarkably stable.@xcite    since all of these experiments involve transition metal compounds , they raise fundamental questions about the dynamics of symmetry breaking transitions and the stability of symmetry broken states in strongly interacting electron systems . while the concept of a phase transition is well understood in equilibrium , it is not obvious how to apply these ideas if a transition occurs under nonequilibrium conditions .",
    "for example , it is unclear whether and how the timescale for the melting of ( quasi ) long - range order is related to equilibrium correlation times .",
    "a recent theoretical study of a dynamical kosterlitz - thouless transition found an evolution through nonthermal ( superheated ) states after a quench , and showed that the transition to a disordered state can become very slow if the latter is close to the equilibrium phase transition.@xcite this example indicates that even a strongly excited nonequilibrium state can differ from a high - temperature disordered state on long timescales .",

    "oca brings a significant improvement , with an almost correct position of the maximum and a quantitatively accurate description of the phase boundary in the strong correlation regime .",

    "this finding of a qualitatively different relaxation pathway and fast thermalization at intermediate coupling is consistent with the results of ref .   for pump - excitations of the paramagnetic mott insulator , and also with the result of ref .   for interaction quenches from a noninteracting initial state",
    "the trapping of the double occupancy is well understood in the strong - coupling limit : for @xmath77 , a unitary schrieffer - wolff transformation @xmath78 can be constructed order - by - order in @xmath79 , such that successively terms of all orders in @xmath79 are removed from the commutator @xmath80 $ ] , and hence @xmath81 is conserved on exponentially long times.@xcite at second order , and after projection to @xmath82 , one would obtain the @xmath57-@xmath83 model , but here we encounter a more general situation , with @xmath84",

    "the initial very fast drop of @xmath89 on the timescale of a few inverse hoppings ( fig .  [ double ] ) , is thus related to the reduction of quantum fluctuations due to the increase of @xmath7 , or equivalently , a strengthening of the local moments . because the quench is faster than the timescale of a quantum fluctuation ,",
    "quantum fluctuations are transformed into real doublon and hole excitations with a certain amplitude .",
    "this gives rise to a nonzero @xmath85 for @xmath90 , whose stability on exponentially long times prevents the system from thermalization .",
    "the argument suggests that both the properties of the trapped magnetic states and the melting of the antiferromagnetic order can be related to the presence of injected free doublons and holes . to further support this fact it is useful to take a closer look at the spectral function .    in fig .",
    "[ tj ] we compare the spectral function of the trapped state ( @xmath91 ) to equilibrium spectral functions of an infinitesimally doped @xmath57-@xmath83 model with @xmath92 and identical magnetization , as well as to a doped afm mott insulator .",

    "[ tj ] reveals a good agreement of this @xmath57-@xmath83 result and the spectral function of the half - filled hubbard model at @xmath47 , which shows that @xmath47 is in the @xmath57-@xmath83 limit , and that the nca solution of the hubbard model in this interaction regime is reliable .",
    "( at non - zero temperature , the spectral functions of the half - filled and infinitesimally doped hubbard model are identical . )",
    "the temperature @xmath93 of the half - filled hubbard model has been adjusted such that the magnetization corresponds to that of the trapped state , while the @xmath57-@xmath83 spectrum has been rescaled by @xmath94 , and the @xmath57-@xmath83 spectrum has been shifted on the frequency axis by @xmath95 .",
    "the figure also shows that the equilibrium results do not very well reproduce the peak structures in the spectral function of the trapped state .",
    "the first peak near the gap edge is more prominent , while the higher energy peaks are smeared out . according to the above strong - coupling argument",
    ", the trapped state might be close to an equilibrium state with additional free doublons and holes .",
    "such a state with doublons and holes is not accessible in thermal equilibrium within the hubbard model . in the paramagnetic case and at low energies ,",
    "its properties are different from a chemically doped state at the same doping.@xcite nevertheless , because the interaction of doublons with other doublons is very different from the interaction of doublons with holes , one may assume that the main correction to the spectral function at positive energies ( i.e. , for inserting a doublon ) is due to the presence of other free doublons , which motivates a comparison of the spectral function of the trapped state to an electron - doped equilibrium state .",
    "we determined the doping level ( @xmath96 ) and temperature ( @xmath97 ) of the equilibrium hubbard model such that the magnetization and double occupancy of the trapped state is reproduced .",
    "the corresponding point in the @xmath98-versus - filling phasediagram ( right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) is indicated by the black star symbol .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ tj ] shows that the spectral function of this doped hubbard model ( shifted on the frequency axis by @xmath99 ) is much closer to that of the trapped state .",
    "in particular , the dominant first peak is well reproduced , while the damping of the peaks at higher energies is still not strong enough .",
    "this may be due to the missing interaction with holons .",
    "our results suggest that the trapped state is essentially an afm mott insulator with simultaneous electron and hole doping , comparable to a state that can be prepared by  photo - doping \" .",
    "the doping level is determined by the density of trapped doublons and holons and the effective temperature is determined by the trapped magnetization . in particular , the effective temperature of the trapped state after a quench from @xmath36 , @xmath37 to @xmath47 is apparently below the neel temperature @xmath100 of this photo - doped state .",
    "this remarkable fact must be the result of  entropy cooling \" : the reduction in the magnetization from @xmath101 to @xmath102 releases a lot of entropy and this in turn keeps the trapped state below its neel temperature .",
    "evidence for the cooling effect is provided by the occupied density of states , @xmath103 which corresponds to a time - resolved photoemission spectrum for a quasi - steady state ( see fig .",
    "[ alesser ] ) .",
    "since doublons and holes are inserted locally , they initially have a large kinetic energy , which leads to a broad distribution of the weight of @xmath104 in the upper hubbard band .",
    "while the magnetization is decreasing , the weight becomes concentrated at low frequencies ( near the lower band edge ) , indicating that doublons and holes are being cooled by exchanging energy with the spin background .",
    "this is in contrast to a quench in the paramagnetic phase , after which the occupation is not redistributed in time,@xcite because within dmft the spin background of the paramagnetic state is completely disordered ( no short range correlations ) and hence does not allow energy exchange with doublons and holes .",
    "if the interpretation of entropy cooling is correct , one should be able to observe the transition of the trapped state from below @xmath100 to above @xmath100 in the nonequilibrium dynamics , by changing the initial density of doublons and holes ( @xmath100 decreases with doping , see right hand panel of fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ) . indeed , as illustrated in fig",
    ".  [ doping ] , the magnetization decays to zero exponentially for quenches from @xmath105 , @xmath37 to @xmath47 , while the system is trapped in magnetized states for quenches from @xmath106 , @xmath37 .",
    "a smaller initial @xmath7 means a larger number of doublons and holes in the initial state , and thus also a larger doping of the effective photo - doped state . in other words , around @xmath107 , the effective photo - doped state crosses @xmath108 .",
    "but even for @xmath109 , where the afm order decays to zero after the quench , the system is still trapped for very long times in a nonthermal state , as can be seen for example by comparing the double occupancy in the trapped state to the thermal value ( top right panel of fig .",
    "[ doping ] ) .",
    "the trapped state still corresponds to a photo - doped state , but now at an effective temperature above @xmath100 .",
    "in this context is also interesting to look at the timescale @xmath110 for melting of the antiferromagnetic order , which diverges like @xmath111 close to the transition ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ doping ] ) .",
    "this divergence resembles the critical slowing down at the equilibrium phase transition , which is related to the divergence of correlation times in equilibrium .",
    "finally , let us comment on implications of these results for other symmetry broken states , in particlular @xmath11-wave superconductivity ( sc ) . as mentioned in the introduction , the afm phase of the half - filled repulsive hubbard model can be mapped onto the @xmath11-wave sc phase in the half - filled attractive model .",
    "the mapping is a particle - hole transformation for the up - spin on the bipartite lattice : @xmath112 for @xmath113 , @xmath114 for @xmath115 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are sublattice indices.@xcite applying this transformation to the repulsive model yields an attractive hubbard model with @xmath116 .",
    "a photo - doped antiferromagnet with doublons and holes transforms into a superconducting or charge - ordered state with an enhanced number of unpaired electrons .",
    "our finding of long - lived nonthermal afm states in the repulsive model therefore implies the existence of similar long - lived nonthermal sc states after quenches within the strongly - interacting regime on the attractive side .",
    "the similarity of the trapped afm state to a photo - doped mott insulator in turn suggests that a similar trapped sc state should appear after a photo - induced pair - breakup in the strongly interacting attractive regime .",
    "the stability of this nonthermal sc is then linked to the slow recombination of unpaired electrons .",
    "while it is clear that our simple model ( with @xmath11-wave superconductivity ) and the single - site dmft formalism are in many respects not appropriate to describe the complicated physics of underdoped cuprates , one can speculate that some of the physics discussed in this paper may be at play in the recently reported experiment by the cavalleri group,@xcite where a photo - induced transient sc state in a cuprate material was found to be stable for several tens of pico - seconds , and thus much longer than the light - pulse which stimulated apical oxygens and ( by a yet unknown mechanism ) induced the sc state .",
    "long - lived , nonthermal symmetry broken states which are stabilized by the exponentially long life - time of doublons should also affect the relaxation dynamics in other strongly correlated , long - range ordered systems , such as cdw compounds .",

    "<S> we study the time evolution of the antiferromagnetic order parameter after interaction quenches in the hubbard model . using the nonequilibrium dynamical mean field formalism </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the system , after a quench from intermediate to strong interaction , is trapped in a nonthermal state which is reminiscent of a photo - doped state and protected by the slow decay of doublons . </S>",
    "<S> if the effective doping of this state is low enough , it exhibits robust antiferromagnetic order , even if the system is highly excited and the thermal state thus expected to be paramagnetic . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on the implication of our findings for the stability of nonthermal superconducting states . </S>"
