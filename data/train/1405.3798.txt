    "super - earth mass and radius measurements leave significant degeneracy regarding their bulk composition .",
    "even with an excellent precision on a super - earth s physical parameters , similar masses and radii could be interpreted very differently @xcite .",
    "one workaround is to have recourse to other types of measurements , such as transmission spectroscopy , occultation and phase - curve photometry to constrain the atmospheric and possibly surface properties .",
    "all these techniques , requiring bright ( @xmath3 ) host stars , have been successfully applied to several hot - jupiters systems and boosted exoplanet characterization to a level far beyond the mass - radius interpretation alone ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to date however , only three transiting super - earths orbiting bright stars have been detected : gj1214b @xcite , 55cnce @xcite and more recently , hd97658b @xcite .",
    "all these super - earths have mean densities favoring volatile - rich compositions .",
    "remarkably , _ kepler _ has revealed a large population of smaller , close - in hot super - earths similar to corot-7b @xcite and kepler-10b @xcite .",
    "these strongly irradiated rocky planets could potentially harbor minimal atmospheres resulting from ground sublimation .",
    "such atmospheres would be primarily made of monoatomic na and o , o@xmath4 and sio @xcite .",
    "close - in super - earths are expected to be tidally locked to their host stars , resulting in large temperature contrasts between the planet s day side and night side , to the point where the atmosphere would condense out at the day - night terminator @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "i propose an approach to explore the reflective properties of close - in super - earths with no dependence on theoretical models .",
    "i conduct a search for occultations over a large sample of super - earths so as to identify common patterns of their surface and/or atmosphere properties .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the photometric analysis , including data reduction and light - curve modeling .",
    "section 3 presents the hierarchical bayesian framework used to interpret the results while section 4 discusses the possible origin of visible flux from _ kepler _ s close - in super - earths .",
    "the target selection is based on the _ kepler _ quarters q0 through q13 ( see * ? ? ? * for q1-q8 ) , which represents 3 years of quasi - continuous monitoring obtained between may 2009 and june 2012 .",
    "all _ kepler _ objects of interest ( koi ) with radii @xmath5 are kept . since this study focuses on how the incident radiation is processed by the planet surface / atmosphere , only those koi that receive significant irradiation with orbital periods",
    "@xmath6 days are retained .",
    "these two selection criteria result in 97 kois that are not flagged as false positives on mast .",
    "the q0-q13 long - cadence simple aperture photometry @xcite is retrieved from mast for each of these 97 planet candidates .",
    "instrumental systematics are mitigated by fitting the first four cotrending basis vectors ( cbv ) to each quarter using the pyke software @xcite .",
    "for each quarter , the degree of photometric dilution is estimated by using the contamination factor in the fits file headers .",
    "each quarter is then normalized to the median .",
    "the goal of this analysis is to refine the transit parameters and to characterize the occultation in the _ kepler _ bandpass for each planet candidate . for this purpose ,",
    "i use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) implementation presented in @xcite .",
    "the long - cadence 29.9-min exposure time is taken into account by resampling the photometric time - series to 1-min cadence directly in the mcmc framework ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "i assume a quadratic law for the limb - darkening ( ld ) and use @xmath7 and @xmath8 as jump parameters , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the quadratic coefficients . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are drawn from the theoretical tables of @xcite for the corresponding @xmath11 and log @xmath12 values extracted from the q1-q16 star properties catalog of @xcite .",
    "constraining the stellar density from the transit photometry is more difficult for super - earths than for hot jupiters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because of the smaller planet / star radius ratio .",
    "i thus include gaussian priors in the mcmc fit for the stellar radius , @xmath11 and log @xmath12 values extracted from @xcite .",
    "each mcmc fit has the following set of jump parameters : the planet / star radius ratio @xmath13 , the impact parameter @xmath14 , the transit duration from first to fourth contact @xmath15 , the time of minimum light @xmath16 , the orbital period @xmath17 , the occultation depth @xmath18 , the two ld combinations @xmath19 and @xmath20 and the two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "i use gaussian priors for @xmath19 and @xmath20 , based on the theoretical tables . to improve the mcmc iteration efficiency and because the planet candidates have short orbital periods ,",
    "i further impose gaussian priors on @xmath21 and @xmath22 by centering the distributions on zero and assuming a standard deviation of 0.45 for both parameters .",
    "these priors prevents the mcmc fit from exploring high eccentricity configurations that seem highly unlikely for such systems @xcite .",
    "negative occultation values are allowed in the mcmc fit to avoid biasing occultation posteriors toward positive values .",
    "i divide the photometric time - series in @xmath2324 to 48  hr segments and fit for each of them the smooth photometric variations due to stellar variability with a time - dependent quadratic polynomial in the mcmc fit .",
    "baseline model coefficients are determined at each step of the mcmc procedure for each lightcurve using a singular value decomposition method .",
    "the resulting coefficients are then used to correct the raw photometric lightcurves . for each data segment",
    ", correlated noise is accounted for following @xcite to ensure reliable error bars on the fitted parameters .",
    "one mcmc fit consisting of two markov chains of 100,000 steps is performed for each planet candidate and their convergence is checked using the gelman - rubin statistic criterion @xcite .",
    "mcmc fit results for all koi are shown in table  [ table ] .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to characterize the planetary total emission in the _ kepler _ bandpass , which is likely to have both thermal and reflected light components .",
    "thus , the occultation in the _ kepler _ bandpass @xmath24 alone does not unambiguously provide a direct estimate of the geometric albedo nor the planet s temperature .",
    "i therefore define in the following the `` total '' albedo , as being a direct translation of the full occultation depth into an albedo estimate .",
    "both the total albedo and brightness temperature are useful means to convert the occultation depth into physical quantities .",
    "i use the posterior distributions functions obtained from the mcmc analyses to compute total albedo and brightness temperature values for all planet candidates .",
    "the total albedo in the _ kepler _ bandpass is :    @xmath25    assuming a planetary blackbody spectrum , the planetary brightness temperature @xmath26 in the _ kepler _ bandpass is obtained from the following equation :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the _ kepler _ transmission function and @xmath29 the planck function . the stellar flux density @xmath30 is obtained by matching each host s properties @xcite to the closest marcs stellar model of @xcite .",
    "several planet candidates that are part of the sample exhibit a moderate photometric signal - to - noise ratio and a short transit duration that , combined to long - cadence time - series , prevent from obtaining a precise estimate of @xmath31 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as a consequence , a mediocre precision on both the albedo and equilibrium temperature is derived for these candidates . in a first step ,",
    "i therefore base the analysis on the brightness temperature instead of the albedo .",
    "false positives are likely to contaminate the sample . in the radius range considered in this study , it is expected that the corresponding false positive rate ranges from 5 to 15% @xcite .",
    "all obvious false - positives have been withdrawn during the q1-q8 @xcite extensive vetting effort .",
    "i choose @xmath32 as a means to discard false positives ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "i keep only those planet candidates that have a total albedo uncertainty less than 1.0 .",
    "this criterion results in a list of 27 candidates , representing 28% of the initial sample .",
    "keeping candidates with @xmath33 is a conservative approach that eliminates most high - albedo false positives but also low - snr planet candidates for which no occultation is detected .",
    "this selection criterion does not bias the results about non detections , as high - snr planetary candidates for which no occultation is detected ( i.e. , low albedo ) will have precise uncertainties on their albedos and will therefore be retained .",
    "i use a @xmath26 vs. period distribution as a means to identify remaining false positives .",
    "i find that koi 2272.01 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 2545.01 and 2636.01 are likely diluted eclipsing binaries . among",
    "the 27 kois resulting from this geometric albedo based selection , 4 only have periods longer than 4 days and all have total albedos @xmath34 .",
    "radius and orbital period distributions for the selected candidates are shown on figure  [ fig_prop ] . as expected , i find that the number of candidates showing an occultation decreases with increasing orbital period , strengthening the planetary nature of the targets @xcite .      figure  [ fig_teq_tb ] shows for each planet candidate the brightness temperature derived from the occultation depth in the _ kepler _ bandpass vs. the planet s equilibrium temperature @xmath35 , assuming a null bond albedo and an efficient heat recirculation @xcite .",
    "the red line is the maximum equilibrium temperature @xmath36 with no heat recirculation while the blue line is for an efficient redistribution , both with a null albedo .",
    "the planet candidates that are part of the sample span equilibrium temperatures ranging from 1200k to 2800k .    to investigate more precisely how @xmath37 evolves with the equilibrium temperature , i compute @xmath38 for each super - earth candidate on figure  [ fig_teq_tdiff ] .",
    "the red dash line depicts planets with @xmath39 .",
    "it is important to note that across the wide range of equilibrium temperatures studied here , the sensitivity to small @xmath40 is better in the elevated @xmath41 regime than in the lower end .",
    "upper limits on @xmath40 are obtained for planets in the less populated area of low @xmath41/low @xmath40 but no objects in the high @xmath41/high @xmath40 are found , where the sensitivity is optimal .",
    "i pursue the analysis in a bayesian framework to explore the incidence of this bias on the results .",
