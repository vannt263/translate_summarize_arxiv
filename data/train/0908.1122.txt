    "the formation of stars is one of the primary drivers of galaxy evolution , and obtaining a full quantitative understanding of this process is an indispensable aspect of any investigation into galaxy behaviour . a profound symbiosis exists between the phenomenon of star formation and the form and content of the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy : a duel analysis , therefore , addressing both the star formation behaviour and gas distribution in a sample of galaxies is ideally suited to characterising the properties of local galaxies , and analysing the results in the context of more global trends .",
    "recent investigations into the evolutionary properties of galaxies have resulted in the striking finding that the distribution of galaxy colours exhibits a marked bimodality , separating ` red and dead ' early type galaxies with little or no ongoing star formation , from a ` blue sequence ' of star forming spirals , with the divide occurring at m@xmath6 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this bivariate distribution can be examined in terms of many other galactic properties , such as the sfr ; the colour - magnitude diagram can be interpreted in terms of sf history and stellar mass content ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the divide between the red and blue sequences emerges also in the star formation rate per unit stellar mass ( specific star formation rate , ssfr ) , as demonstrated by @xcite and @xcite : the distribution in the ssfr vs. m@xmath7 plane is bimodal , with a red sequence of low sfr massive galaxies ( ssfr @xmath8 ) , and a less massive blue sequence of galaxies with significatly higher ssfrs ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite use these areas to classify galaxies as either on or off a ` sf sequence ' , along which many sf parameters ( such as the sfr surface density , @xmath10 ) are close to constant . in this picture , the blue ` main sequence ' galaxies evolve secularly towards higher m@xmath7 while gradually lowering their ssfrs , while the red sequence turn over is caused by the quenching of the sf .",
    "conversely , galaxies can be driven off the main sequence in the other direction ( towards higher ssfrs ) by an event - such as an interaction - that triggers an increased sfr , or a sudden starburst ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rate at which a galaxy is forming stars is , however , in some sense a ` high level process ' , being both complex and dependent on the more fundamental underlying properties of the galaxy - primarily the content of the ism .",
    "the galactic ` gas fraction ' ( as opposed to the absolute amount of gas , which is strongly dependent on the mass of the host galaxy ) provides information on the evolutionary history of the system in question , and also determines the potential for future star formation . as such , an understanding of how the gas fraction varies from galaxy to galaxy may help shed light on the origin of the bifurcation in the colour - magnitude plane ; tentative explorations of the causes underlying this phenomena have highlighted the role of gas - @xcite , for example , note that the bifurcation mass coincides with the transition between the ` cold accretion ' and ` cooling flow ' regimes of model galaxy formation .",
    "however , the role of interstellar gas in the development of the range of galaxies we see today has not been fully explored . a key question to address",
    "is whether the bimodal division into two galactic types can ultimately be seen as a consequence of the underlying gas behaviour .",
    "investigations into the global properties of galaxies have principally focused on the upper end of the luminosity function , due to the ease at which brighter systems can be studied .",
    "however , investigations into star forming behaviour in low mass dwarf galaxies have resulted in some unexpected findings .",
    "a study by @xcite investigated the distribution of the ssfr ( measured via the h@xmath4 equivalent width ) with absolute magnitude for a small volume limited sample of local galaxies ( obtained from the 11mpc h@xmath4 uv galaxy survey , [ 11hugs ] ) , with h@xmath4 derived sfrs for the population of local low luminosity dwarf galaxies , down to m@xmath11 .",
    "in addition to the well studied transition ( found by @xcite to be at m@xmath12 ) , a second transition was found , with low mass dwarf galaxies ( m@xmath13 -15 ) having a very large ( @xmath14 3 dex ) spread in their specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) . between the two transition regions ,",
    "the ssfr was found to inhabit a very restricted range of values , implying a high degree of regulation in the star forming behaviour of the blue sequence - this comprises the ` main sequence ' of star forming galaxies discussed above .",
    "these findings suggest that there may be three distinct modes of star forming behaviour operating across the mass spectrum , rather than two as previously thought .",
    "a lack of correlation with environmental factors @xcite suggests that internal processes are responsible for this third mode , but the nature of these process is , as yet , unclear .    in this paper ,",
    "the star formation properties and interstellar medium ( ism ) content of a sample of local galaxies are characterised in order to delineate the various populations that exist along the low - redshift hubble sequence . as such",
    ", we seek to determine the extent to which the previously described bimodality in the ssfr is solely a result of the standard scaling of star formation rate with gas content ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .    our primary sample ,",
    "the 11hugs dataset , is highly complete at the lower end of the mass function , but suffers from a paucity of bright massive objects : while over 80% of the sample has a sfr lower than the lmc , just @xmath06% have sfrs greater than the milky way ( taking sfr@xmath15=2 - 6 m@xmath16 yr@xmath17 , as reported by @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we aim to augment the 11hugs dataset with more voluminous surveys , to see whether the inclusion of more data at the brighter end of the luminosity function would corroborate previous findings .",
    "our overall compiled sample , consisting of nearly a thousand local galaxies , provides a dataset with not only excellent completeness at low ( @xmath0smc ) masses , but also coverage over a large enough volume to statistically sample galaxies with masses comparable to or greater than the milky way .",
    "this sample allows star formation rates and gas contents to be compared in a uniform manner over a mass spectrum spanning five orders of magnitude .",
    "this paper will also re - evaluate the possibility of a ` third mode ' of star formation existing in low mass dwarfs , again in the context of the available gas supply .    in  2 , we describe the samples and data drawn upon for this work , and briefly describe the calculations we have used to derive various parameters . in  3 , a demographic analysis of the gas behaviour , star forming behaviour , and the link between the two",
    "are presented in turn for both a highly complete local volume sample , and a more populous deeper sample .",
    "these results are discussed in more detail in  4 , and we present conclusions in  5 .",
    "there were two primary drivers behind the selection of data .",
    "firstly , a large sample was required , in order to represent as fully as possible the trends in gas properties and star forming behaviour in the local universe . in order for this aim",
    "to be realised , the sample must be relatively homogeneous , in order to investigate the range of ` normal ' behaviours ; many galaxies are observed precisely because of their unusual behaviour , with the result that an uncritical compilation of h@xmath4 and hi  data from the literature would likely result in biases towards more extreme objects .",
    "secondly , in order to characterise the full range of behaviours across the entire mass spectrum , good completeness at the lower end of the luminosity function was required .",
    "low mass dwarf galaxies are the numerically dominant galaxy type , but malmquist - type biases result in their exclusion from many observational investigations . as a result , volume limited local surveys ( which will be dwarf - dominated ) have been utilised .",
    "the resulting combined sample has the advantage of being highly complete at low masses , and large enough to be representative at high masses . in order to ensure that the final compilation is as bias - free as possible , the analysis has been repeated for the local volume sample ( see  3.2 ) , with no change in result .",
    "information on the star formation properties of galaxies in the local volume was obtained from the h@xmath4 survey of @xcite .",
    "this survey is an essentially volume limited sample of 436 local galaxies ( d @xmath18 11 mpc ) .",
    "galaxies were selected with the added proviso that galaxies in the so called ` zone of avoidance ' ( e.g. lying in the galactic plane , @xmath19 ) were excluded .",
    "this survey includes the 436 known galaxies within 11 mpc , and is essentially complete for m@xmath20 -15.5 , and m(hi ) @xmath21 m@xmath16 @xcite , providing excellent statistics on the star formation rates of the low luminosity dwarf population .",
    "this sample has good statistical sampling of the lower end of the luminosity function , but due to the rarity of bright ( m@xmath22 -19 ) galaxies in the local volume surveys covering larger volumes were required to achieve improved statistical coverage at the upper end .",
    "the survey of was chosen for this purpose .",
    "this is a h@xmath4 based survey of 334 galaxies , taken from the uppsala general catalogue ( ugc ) , which has a magnitude limit of b = 15.5 .",
    "the galaxies examined in the james et al .",
    "h@xmath4 survey were chosen to have recession velocities of @xmath23 3000 km s@xmath17 ( d@xmath2443 mpc ; assuming h@xmath25 = 70 km s@xmath17mpc@xmath17 ) .",
    "james et al . also stipulated that the galaxies have a morphological t - type @xmath26 0 ( s0/a or later ) .",
    "in addition to the sample of , many galaxies were included from the large database of h@xmath4 galaxies ( kennicutt et al .",
    "2010 , in prep ) .",
    "more than 3000 galaxies have been observed in h@xmath4 @xcite , providing a rich and varied dataset to sample .",
    "however , the data are extremely heterogeneous , with many of the galaxies being investigated precisely because of their unusual , or indeed exceptional , behaviour . in order to provide a characteristic representation of local universe star formation , unbiased towards extreme objects , surveys and compilations specifically targeting cluster members ( such as the goldmine sample of ) and",
    "starburst galaxies were excluded .",
    "the complete h@xmath4 sample consists of 1110 galaxies .",
    "[ [ hi ] ] hi ~~    detection of the neutral atomic component of the ism in low redshift galaxies is comparatively easy , due to the high sensitivity available at wavelengths of 21 cm , and as such many large hi  surveys exist in the literature . for this study ,",

    "this is a large ( @xmath0 9000 ) galaxy compilation of optically selected galaxies in the low redshift universe , collected over a period of 20 + years , selected to have heliocentric velocities of @xmath27 .",
    "a total of 8850 galaxies were detected unequivocally in hi with a further 156 and 494 being marginally detected and not detected respectively .    in order to remove the strong effect of galactic stellar mass on the hi  content , and to provide a parameter as closely analogous to ssfr as possible , the hi  content is presented in the form of a hi  mass to stellar mass ratio , _",
    "r_(hi ) , defined as m@xmath28/m@xmath7 .",
    "this constrains the analysis to those galaxies with available photometry in order to measure the stellar mass ( see  2.5 below ) .",
    "a total of 7486 ` detected ' galaxies from the springob survey possess archival b - band photometry - this makes up the bulk of the hi  sample .",
    "in addition , to provide hi  information for local dwarf galaxies , the hi  data from the @xcite compilation will be included in the analysis .",
    "this is an all sky catalogue of 451 galaxies , selected to have a distance @xmath18 10 mpc ( @xmath29 @xmath18 550 km s@xmath17 ) , which contains both optical photometry and 21 cm hi  data , making it ideal for an analysis of ism content .",
    "the limiting magnitude of the survey was b@xmath30 = 17.5 , with a resulting absolute magnitude limit of m@xmath31 -7 at 1 mpc , and m@xmath31 -12 at 10 mpc .",
    "additional 21 cm hi  data to complement the h@xmath4 dataset was obtained from the sample of springob et al . , the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) , and the online reference catalogue of astrophysical data hyperleda ( ) . the total number of galaxies included in the hi  analysis is therefore 7819 .",
    "the study of molecular hydrogen is important to the understanding of star formation : to the best of our knowledge , it is only inside the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complexes that stars can form .",
    "h@xmath2 is much more challenging to detect than hi ; few galaxies have been mapped in co ( the fcrao extragalactic survey of @xcite , for example , contains resolved co data for 300 galaxies ) , and fewer still have the unresolved co measurements required to measure the global co flux , necessary to calculate a _ total _ molecular hydrogen mass .",
    "229 galaxies in the fcrao survey have global integrated co fluxes recorded .",
    "in addition , archival co data for 245 galaxies has been compiled and presented by @xcite , which were added to the sample .",
    "h@xmath2 is very difficult to detect in dwarf galaxies ; they have little to no co emission , and uncertainties in the co - h@xmath2 conversion factor at low metallicities mean that it is extremely challenging to get accurate h@xmath2 masses for the lowest luminosity galaxies in our sample . a recent survey by @xcite attempts to address this issue , and from there we take 10 sources that overlap with our sample .",
    "a total of 392 unique galaxies with single dish co fluxes were used , 43 of which have only upper limits on their co fluxes .",
    "figure [ fig : venn ] shows a diagrammatical representation of the sample sizes for different data types , and the number of sources with various combinations of available data .      * hi mass * :    hi , detected via the hyperfine splitting spin transition of atomic hydrogen emitting at 21 cm ( @xmath32 = 1420 mhz ) , is the most powerful available probe of the ism . the forbidden nature of the transition results in most accumulations of hi  being optically thin , with a direct proportionality between the 21 cm luminosity and the number of emitting atoms .",
    "the neutral hydrogen mass is therefore given by the simple formula @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the integrated 21 cm line flux in jy km s@xmath17 , and the distance d is in mpc .",
    "* h@xmath2 mass * :    the molecule h@xmath2 lacks a permanent electric dipole moment , and as such is very difficult to detect directly . instead , co emission ( e.g.  the j = @xmath35 transition at @xmath36 mm ) is measured , and converted to a h@xmath2 column density ( e.g. @xcite ) the ` standard ' calibration used ( the oft discussed co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor , given by @xcite ) is @xmath37^{-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is generally taken to be 2 - 3 ; we take the x - factor to be a constant value of 2.8 .",

    "this assumption of a constant co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor ( as opposed to , say , a luminosity dependent factor as presented by @xcite ) will have the tendency to underestimate the mass of molecular hydrogen in the low mass dwarf galaxies .",

    "* stellar mass * :    @xcite note that the stellar mass to light ratio shows trends with various galaxy parameters ( including surface brightness , gas fraction , k - band magnitude , colour , and galaxy mass ) , and - most critically for this study - has a dependency on the recent star formation history of the galaxy in question . using any given photometric luminosity ( even the k - band ) as a proxy for the stellar mass will therefore introduce errors , as there is no passband where the mass to light ( m / l ) ratio is constant .",
    "bell & de jong s model ( m / l ) ratios correlate strongly with galactic colour ; they therefore provide the algorithm @xmath58 where for b - v colours and b - band photometry , @xmath59(b ) = -1.110 and @xmath60(b ) = 2.018 , for a scaled salpeter imf and a mass dependent formation epoch model ( as described by , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a potential problem with this method is the lack of complete photometric datasets from which the colours can be derived : archival b - v photometry ( corrected for reddening ) is only available for @xmath61 of the sample ( 498 galaxies of the total 1049 ) .",
    "however , it is possible to accurately estimate a colour based on morphological type ( e.g. @xcite ; ) , where the morphological types are coded in the rc3 system as reported in the hyperleda database .",

    "it is worth noting in figures [ fig : hist2 ] and [ fig : hist1 ] that for all bins save the least luminous , the value of @xmath125(hi ) is systematically greater than @xmath125(ssfr ) .",

    "is lower than @xmath125(ssfr ) in all bins .",
    "this variation in slope can be seen as a change in the mean hi  consumption timescale ( as discussed by , for example , @xcite ; ; @xcite ) : with increasing luminosity , the hi  content drops off faster than the sfr , resulting in shorter hi  consumption timescales for more luminous galaxies .",
    "this is shown explicitly in figure [ fig : consume ] , where the mean hi  consumption time decreases monotonically with increasing luminosity ( upward facing arrows denote galaxies with only upper limits on their sfrs ) .",
    "an interesting feature of figure [ fig : consume ] is the lower limit - with the exception of one galaxy ( ngc 2681 ) , all points have hi  consumption times @xmath14100 myr , which is ( approximately ) one dynamical time for a typical galaxy .",
    "this lower cut - off effect is caused by the sfr ceiling , found to be roughly equal to the gas mass divided by the minimum time to assemble the gas - i.e. the free - fall collapse time .",
    "naturally , therefore , there should be a rough lower limit to the consumption time equal to the dynamical time .",

    "= -12.27 ) has a hi  consumption time of @xmath128 years .",
    "these long consumption times likely result from a combination of a very low sfr and an extended hi  disc , where a large fraction of the hi  disc , though recorded by the single dish measurements , is not actively available for star formation .",

    "each observational parameter will come with some associated error , as will each variable conversion . as a result ,",
    "it is imperative to assess how much scatter in the relationships will be driven by these errors , and how much results from innate parametrical variance .",

    "extinction correction errors are also , in general , small , though the scatter in the statistical relationship does increase as a function of luminosity . while the scatter for the least luminous dwarf galaxies ( which have very small levels of extinction ) is negligable ( @xmath08% ) , the scatter at the luminous end ( m@xmath101 ) is @xmath040% .",
    "the scatter between these extremes is @xmath020% .    by",

    "figure [ fig : hi ] shows the distribution of the normalised hi  content for a very large sample of low redshift galaxies , across the entire luminosity function .",
    "it reproduces the long known result ( e.g. ) that earlier type galaxies , at the more luminous end of the spectrum , have far less gas per unit stellar mass than their less massive companions , having long ago converted the ism material into stars .",
    "the least massive galaxies , on the other hand , have yet to exhaust - or indeed fully tap - the hi  available in the ism .",
    "this is , of course , in accordance with the downsizing paradigm , whereby massive galaxies finish their star forming era at higher redshifts , whereas the mean star formation rate of dwarf galaxies has changed little over cosmic time .",
    "this investigation is somewhat hampered by the paucity of massive very early type galaxies , which comprise the classic red sequence .",
    "it is possible to discern , however , a small population of massive galaxies ( m@xmath142 ) , which ` turn over ' towards very low hi  mass ratios of @xmath116 .",
    "this suggests that the red - blue sequence divide is at least connected to the availability of hi  in the ism .",
    "the three plots in figure [ fig : gas_comp ] show the variation in _",
    "r_(gas ) with the species of gas being considered .",
    "panel ( a ) confirms that the hi  properties of this restricted sample ( only galaxies with both hi  and h@xmath2 data are included here ) are consistent with the larger sample shown in figure [ fig : hi ] .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the equivalent plot for the normalised molecular gas content .",
    "immediately obvious is the fact that there is no strong trend in _",
    "r_(h@xmath2 ) with m@xmath41 , as there is in hi ; the dwarf galaxies have normalised gas contents similarly low as the more massive spirals .",
    "this is , of course , an affirmation of the result that dwarf galaxies are hi  dominated , with the molecular contribution to their ism being small , and has been noted previously ( e.g. ) .",
    "it does , however , rely on the assumption of the infallibility of the co - h@xmath2 ratio , which some authors have theorised to become unreliable in low mass ( hence low metallicity ) systems . work on calibrating the conversion factor to low metallicity systems is ongoing ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even with a more sophisticated calibration , however , it is unlikely that the molecular component of the lowest mass galaxies is comparable to the hi  content .",
    "more interesting is the existence of an apparent maximum h@xmath2 content of approximately 30 - 50% ( log _ r_(h@xmath143 0 ) , where no such maximum is seen in the hi  distribution . hi  and h@xmath2 display very different behavioural features when spatially mapped -",
    "while the h@xmath2 distribution tends to be centrally peaked , falling off with radius , hi  typically has a much more flat profile , often having a constant surface density out to many times the optical radius ( e.g. ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "single dish integrated measurements of the hi then , measure the total neutral hydrogen content of a galaxy , not all of which may be actively involved in the star formation process .",
    "it is possible that many galaxies ( particularly dwarf galaxies which lack the ability to gravitationally collapse them ) have large hi  reserves inhabiting their outer discs , which is unavailable for star formation : this would lead to the extremely high hi  contents ( log _ r_(hi ) @xmath82 ) seen in figures [ fig : hi ] and [ fig : gas_comp ] .",
    "by contrast , global integrated measurements of the molecular gas mass only measure the dense circumnuclear gas , which suffers from this apparent maximum .",
    "this limit may result from a gravitational threshold effect , whereby having a large reserve of h@xmath2 in the ism without concomitant star formation is simply not a stable situation for a galaxy .",
    "alternatively , it may be that photodissociation effects are the cause of the limit , whereby the interstellar uv radiation field photodissociates any large agglomerations of molecular gas ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of this threshold is not fully understood , however , and a full exposition of the various theories certainly lies beyond the scope of this work .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the distribution of the normalised _ total _ gas content , calculated by adding the hi  and h@xmath2 components and applying a standard helium correction .",
    "unsurprisingly , at low masses , this plot is essentially identical to the equivalent hi  plot , as the galaxies in question are highly hi  dominated . as the galaxies increase in luminosity , the hi  component decreases while the h@xmath2 gas mass ratio shows no significant trend with m@xmath41 , with the result that galaxies become more h@xmath2 dominated with increasing mass .",
    "the distribution also tightens compared to the hi  locus in panel ( a ) .",
    "in addition , the gas - poor outliers are much less apparent , although this may result from the uncertainty introduced by the co upper limits - in the absence of conclusive co masses for these galaxies , it can not be said with certainty that the downturn is absent .      as explained in  [ sfr_analysis ] above , plot ( b ) of both figures [ fig : kara1 ] and [ fig : main1 ] displays essentially the same trends as identified by @xcite , particularly with respect to the two transitions , at m@xmath101 and m@xmath102 .",
    "these transitions are also apparent when considering the absolute sfr ( figure [ fig : sfrmb ] ) , with many galaxies in these two magnitude classes falling outside of a ` main sequence ' of star forming galaxies .",
    "we address these two transitions in turn .    at the upper end of the luminosity function ,",
    "the h@xmath4 based ssfrs exhibit the characteristic turnover towards low values ( @xmath144 yr@xmath17 ) , indicating that their star formation is being suppressed .",
    "it is , however , important to note that this turn over does _ not _ manifest in the distributions of the total ( atomic plus molecular ) gas ratio - which as figure [ fig : corrgraph ] shows is better correlated with ssfr at the high mass end than hi .",
    "it is likely that this paradoxical situation is caused by the fact that the number of quenched galaxies is small ( @xmath145 ) compared to the number of galaxies in the bulk of the distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : corrgraph ] shows that for the majority of high luminosity galaxies ( making up the bulk of the distribution ) , their sfr is being driven by the molecular component of the ism .",
    "however , the lack of a break in the molecular ( and total ) gas distribution ( figure [ fig : gas_comp ] , panels b and c ) suggests that while the main sequence of star formation is driven by the molecular component , quenching events that suppress star formation primarily affect the hi  content , which leads to the mirrored ` turnovers ' , seen in both ssfr and f@xmath28 .",
    "we move now to the likely causes of the large spread in the specific star formation rate distribution of the low luminosity dwarf galaxies .",
    "the possible causes of this behaviour can be categorised under two main headings ; firstly , the various physical mechanisms that could cause the star formation properties of dwarf galaxies to not only exhibit a large spread , but also be decoupled from their gas contents .",
    "the second possibility is that at low luminosities , the star formation rate is not being faithfully traced by the h@xmath4 luminosity , leading to a mischaracterisation of the sfr .",
    "these will be addressed in turn .",
    "there has been much work dedicated to the processes involved in star formation at low masses ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and @xcite , to name just a few ) .",
    "much of this work has centred on the role of kinematical disturbances : being as they are small systems , dwarf galaxies are inherently more susceptible than their more massive counterparts to various types of disruption .",
    "their shallower potential wells leave them open to disturbances resulting from both internal and external events and processes which could act to change the star formation behaviour . @xcite",
    "first noticed that dwarf galaxies exhibited a distinctly different mode of star formation compared to ` normal ' spirals , being dominated by a ` bursting ' mode , and @xcite argued that this bursting mode results from internal feedback processes ; supernovae ( the rate of which is proportional to sfr ) in low mass galaxies have a large chance of disrupting the ism so that sf is quenched , until it can re - collapse enough to trigger another star forming event .",
    "@xcite ran closed box smooth particle hydrodynamical simulations of low mass galaxies ( @xmath146 ) , finding that the sfr in these low mass galaxies exhibited periodic fluctuations ( which they termed ` breathing ' ) , and that the amplitude of these fluctuations varied inversely with the size of the galaxy .",
    "however , it is unclear whether these processes are sufficient to explain the range of behaviours displayed by the dwarf galaxies in our sample .",
    "the simulations of @xcite , for example , show only a range of @xmath0 1 dex in sfr ( ranging from @xmath147 to @xmath148 ) in the lowest mass galaxy considered - insufficient to explain the full @xmath0 3 dex range in sfr ( and ssfr ) in figure [ fig : sfrmb ] and [ fig : main1 ] .",
    "the possibility must then be considered that the true sfr in dwarf galaxies is not being reliably measured by standard linear conversions of the h@xmath4 luminosity .",
    "a number of possible causes have been discussed in previous work , with recent attention being focussed on stochasticity in the formation of high mass , ionizing stars , and the potential of systematic variations in the imf ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in terms of stochasticity , the upper end of the imf will only be sparsely sampled in galaxies with low sfrs . if the mean time between formation of an o star is greater than the mean lifetime of an o star ( @xmath05 myr ) , then there will be times where the galaxy does not host an o star , but lower mass stars are being formed .",
    "this will result in episodic h@xmath4 emission , unrelated to the true underlying sfr , or other physical properties such as the gas or stellar mass .",
    "beyond pure statistical effects , there has also been recent debate on whether the imf in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies could be systematically deficient in high mass stars .",
    "it may be that some combination of such effects are required in order to explain our results in the low mass regime .",
    "the low mass group contains many galaxies with high ssfrs , which are rapidly forming gas into stars , along with the galaxies with apparently quenched ssfrs . in figure 5 , for example , the low mass group contains both galaxies on the ` main sequence ' and galaxies with extremely low sfrs of @xmath23 @xmath149m@xmath16yr@xmath17 . in one possible scenario ,",
    "the effect of variations in the star formation histories of low mass galaxies on the h@xmath4 luminosity are amplified by stochasticity in the formation of high mass stars . during active periods of star formation , the h@xmath4 luminosity is more likely to accurately trace the sfr , whereas during relatively quiescent periods , when the sfr drops below a certain threshold ( @xmath010@xmath150 m@xmath151 yr@xmath17 ) , the h@xmath4 emission drops dramatically , creating the illusion of more quenching than actually exists .",
