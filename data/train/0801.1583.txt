    "the theory of modulated structures in macroscopic ferromagnets dzialoshin , ferroelectrics @xcite and metal alloys @xcite has a rich history .",
    "the number of works dedicated to a study of the modulated structures in small samples is significantly less @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to the theory of the modulated structures ( including the incommensurate ones ) uses the constant order parameter amplitude function approximation @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our consideration of the bounded sample ( thin film , in particular ) requires us to drop this approximation : the order parameter must satisfy some boundary conditions and it is unlikely to find a solution with constant order parameter satisfying these conditions .",
    "that is why we have to consider a generic case of connected set of the nonlinear equations for the order parameter amplitude and phase functions .",
    "we will show here that the solutions of this system are significantly more complicated , than in the constant order parameter approximation .",

    "now we introduce the dimensionless variables:@xmath12 then the equations ( [ ampeq ] ) and ( [ phaseeq ] ) take the form@xmath13 @xmath14",
    "let us begin from the limit @xmath15 then the equation ( [ phaseeqdimless ] ) can be solved:@xmath16 where @xmath17 r\\left ( 0\\right ) ^{2}$ ] is the integration constant , which is determined by the initial conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "now we can substitute this expression for @xmath20 into the equation ( ampeqdimless ) .",
    "we obtain in result a closed equation for the amplitude function @xmath21@xmath22    this equation can be interpreted as a dynamics equation with the effective potential:@xmath23    an interesting feature of this potential is its dependence on the initial conditions via the constant @xmath24 there exists a domain of parameters , where the potential has a minimum and , therefore , an oscillating solution for the amplitude function can take place .",
    "a condition of the maximum and minimum points merging into the inflection point with the horizontal derivative @xmath25 gives the equation    @xmath26    however , a presence of a minimum is necessary but not sufficient condition : an oscillating solution will not exist if the initial point is situated outside the potential well .    a border line for the domain , where oscillating solutions can exist is depicted here :    fig.1 . a border line for the domain , where oscillating solutions can exist .",
    "if we have a solution for the amplitude function @xmath27 the phase function @xmath28 is given by the equation ( [ phasesolution ] ) .",
    "the phase function consists from two terms : a slow contribution stemming from the second term in ( [ phasesolution ] ) and more or less diffused jumps due to the first term in this equation .",
    "it is important that the jump value equals exactly to @xmath29    the first integral of [ ampeqdimless ] reads @xmath30 so @xmath31    notice that the jump value @xmath32 calculated in the vicinity of the @xmath33 minimum equals to @xmath34 where @xmath35 we have used the first integral of ( [ ampclosed ] ) above .",
    "only leading terms of @xmath36 were taken into account .",
    "note that the model ( [ free2 ] ) , which can be reduced to the sine - gordon model in the limit of @xmath37 , admits solutions with jumps exactly equal to @xmath38 ( topological charge @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have obtained a similar result within the approximation @xmath39 , i.e. neglecting the cosine term in ( [ free2 ] ) ! as it is seen from the formulae [ phasejump ] , these phase jumps appear due to the excursion of the amplitude function near the singularity @xmath40 .",
    "the equation ( [ ampclosed ] ) can be solved analytically , but we will present below numerical solutions both for @xmath39 and @xmath41",
    "some results of calculation of the amplitude and phase functions spatial dependence for the case of @xmath39 are presented below .",
    "figures 2  5 and 6  9 differ only by initial values of the amplitude function : in the case of figures 2  5 we have small initial amplitude function and , therefore , oscillations of the amplitude function are near to harmonic ones , while in the case of figures 6  9 the initial amplitude function is near to the apex of the hump and , therefore , we have a train of solitons .    fig.2 .",
