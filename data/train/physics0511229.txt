    "the alice transition radiation detector ( trd)@xcite is a large area ( 750m@xmath1 , 1.18 million readout channels ) device that offers precise tracking and electron identification and  combining these two capabilities  a fast trigger on high-@xmath2 electrons and jets .",

    "the produced tr photons have energies in the x - ray range , with the bulk of the spectrum from 1 to 30kev . in the drift chambers of the alice trd a gas mixture of xe and co@xmath0 ( 15% ) is used to provide efficient absorption of these photons . to discriminate electrons from the large background of pions in the momentum range of interest (",

    "* only electrons reach a velocity that exceeds the tr production threshold .    in the alice trd , as in any other trd , tr is superimposed on the ionization energy loss , due to the small angle of emission ( @xmath5 ) with respect to the emitting particles trajectory .",
    "this explains why the existing measurements of tr spectra@xcite are scarce . in this publication , we investigate specific features of tr , in particular its spectral distributions and momentum dependence produced in the alice trd _ sandwich _ radiators . by improving the experimental setup with respect to a similar earlier measurement@xcite ,",

    "while for our earlier measurement of tr spectra the range in momenta covered was restricted by the possible range of the magnetic field and by the experimental configuration@xcite , we are now able to present measurements over a broad momentum range from 1 to 10gev / c . the ( uncorrected ) results for all radiators are shown in fig .",

    "for all radiators , a systematic increase of the photon yield as a function of momentum is observed .",
    "the two regular radiators show the best performance , followed by the _ fiber _ radiator and the _",
    "sandwich_. for the _ foam _ radiator only two measurements at 8 and 10gev / c are available ; the photon yield of this material is somewhat lower than for the other cases . with the _ dummy _ radiator and without radiator",
    "we observe a considerable amount of photons in the drift chamber .",
    "this photon background is investigated in the following section .",
    "tr from our radiators is not the only possible source of photons detected in the drift chamber .",
    "one could suspect tr from different sources ( material in the beam line ) , bremsstrahlung from material in the beam ( or from the radiators ) and synchrotron radiation from the electrons in the magnetic field .",
    "the influence of bremsstrahlung created in the radiators can be investigated by looking at the data for the dummy radiator ( since its radiation length is comparable to the radiation length of the radiators , see table [ radiat ] ) and comparing it to the data without radiator ( see fig . [ tr - mom1 ] ) .",
    "since the photon yield is very similar , we can exclude that the influence of bremsstrahlung from the radiators is significant .        while the contribution of tr from other material in the beam line is expected to be very small",

    "this explanation is supported by the distribution of the average signal amplitudes across the pads shown in fig .",

    "case sr photons are emitted continuously along the curved electron tracks and their absorption with respect to the beam position in the detector is expected to be uniform up to a certain distance from the particle track .",
    "synchrotron radiation ( sr ) occurs when charged particles move on a curved path .",
    "since the energy radiated by the particle is proportional to @xmath22 , it can be produced with a sizeable yield in our momentum range by electrons only . in the following treatment , the magnetic field",
    "is assumed to be constant and uniform , neglecting possible fringe field effects .",
    "then the energy radiated by an ultra - relativistic electron along a trajectory of length @xmath23 is @xcite    @xmath24    the velocity @xmath25 of the particle is measured in units of the speed of light .",
    "we are interested in the spectral distribution of the radiated photons @xmath26 .",

    "the characteristic energy @xmath33 of the sr is given by @xmath34 .",
    "examples of sr energy spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ specprodsr ] .",
    "the mean number of produced sr photons at all energies is the integral of the spectral distribution ( eq . [ srspectrum ] ) , which can be approximated as    @xmath35        fig .",
    "[ sr - mom ] shows the measured photon background from fig .",
    "[ tr - mom1 ] ( without radiator ) together with sr simulations .",
    "the mean number of sr photons produced per electron along the curved electron track is about 0.4 at 1gev / c and rises to around 4 at 10gev / c .",
    "however , most low energy photons are absorbed in the material before the drift chamber volume , while at higher momenta some high energy photons ( @xmath3630kev ) exit the drift chamber undetected . as a consequence , we find that no photons are detected up to 2gev / c electron momentum and about 1.7 at 10gev / c .",
    "the cluster search algorithm is not able to reconstruct photons that are deposited very close to the beam , where a large part of the sr photons are expected to be deposited . by running the cluster search algorithm on simulated sr data",
    "we observe a reconstruction efficiency of around 40% . taking this into account",
    ", the agreement with the measurement is very good and we conclude that we observe a background of synchrotron radiation in our measurements .",
    "this background can be subtracted when investigating mean values .",
    "in addition , in the momentum region up to 2gev / c the contribution of sr is negligible , and as a consequence our tr energy spectra for those momenta are free from sr .",
    "[ sr - spec ] shows measured photon energy spectra without radiator together with simulated sr spectra for electrons of 6gev / c .",
    "the agreement is quite good .          in this section",
    "we compare the measured spectral distributions of tr for 2gev / c electrons to simulations .",
    "the low energy threshold of the tr search algorithm ( 0.1kev ) and the dynamic range of the employed flash adc system lead to meaningful data in the energy range of interest .        in fig .",
    "[ tr - spec - reg ] we show the measured distributions of tr energy per photon ( @xmath37 ) and per incident electron ( total tr energy , @xmath38 ) for the two regular radiators at 2gev / c together with simulations .",
    "the simulated spectra are obtained using the procedure described in section [ sim ] , where the values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are fixed by the geometries of the radiators ( see table [ radiat ] ) . if a correction for the cluster separation inefficiency is performed the agreement is good .",
    "however , the simulated spectra are somewhat harder in both cases .",
    "the observable @xmath38 is not affected by the tr search algorithm .",
    "events with @xmath39 are mainly due to events with no tr photon ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "again , we observe that the simulated spectra are harder , especially for the radiator _",
    "reg2_. this discrepancy can not be explained by slight variations of the foil number , thickness or spacing .",
    "measured and simulated tr spectra for the alice trd _ sandwich _ radiator and for the _ fiber _ radiator at 2gev / c are shown in fig .",
    "[ tr - spec - sandw ] .",
    "the spectra for the two radiators are very similar , which is surprising , since the _ sandwich _ radiator also contains the carbon fiber and mylar layers and some amount of epoxy . in the simulation",
    "we use the theory described in section [ sim ] .",
    "since the two radiators are not regular foil structures , the parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 can only reflect typical dimensions of the radiator materials ( see fig .",
    "[ radiators ] ) , but are not unambiguously determined .",
    "our set of parameters ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 m and @xmath43 m ) was chosen to best reproduce our measurements , taking into account also the influence for the limited cluster separation efficiency .",
    "this set of parameters leads to a good agreement with the data for both radiator types .       on the momentum for the two regular radiators and for the _ sandwich _ and _ fiber _ radiators .",
    "the measured data are corrected for sr ; the simulated data show the actual detected mean number of tr photons with and without the helium pipe and its entrance windows included in the simulation and the mean number of photons reconstructed by the tr cluster search algorithm.,width=529 ]    we perform the correction of the measured mean values of the tr yield for the photon background due to sr by subtracting the mean values obtained without radiator .",
    "since we performed measurements for the _ sandwich _ radiator at more momenta than without radiator , the data at these momenta are obtained by the subtracting interpolated values for the sr background .",
    "[ ntr - mom - corr ] shows the momentum dependence of the mean number of tr photons @xmath20 for the two regular radiators , for the _ sandwich _ radiator and for the _ fiber _ radiator .",
    "we find that for all radiators up to roughly 0.2 photons are absorbed in the helium pipe , the entrance windows and the air in between .",
    "we also include in the simulation the full tr cluster search algorithm that was used on the measured data .",
    "this leads to a good reproduction of the measured data for the two regular radiators , in contrast to earlier findings , where the simulations overestimated the data , in particular for xe - based detectors@xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , in the case of the irregular radiators the parameters for the simulation ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) were tuned to best reproduce the measurements .     as a function of momentum for the two regular foil radiators and for the _ sandwich _ and _ fiber _ radiators . for the _ sandwich _ radiator",
    "we also include mean values extracted from the total energy loss spectra.,width=529 ]    fig .",
    "[ etrntr - mom ] shows the momentum dependence of the mean total tr energy for the four radiators . in case of the _ sandwich _ radiator",
    "this observable can also be extracted from two measurements of total energy loss spectra in the drift chamber without radiators ( only d@xmath6/d@xmath7 ) and with radiators ( d@xmath6/d@xmath7 + tr ) . in this case",
    "the energy spectra are averaged over four ( 2002 ) and three chambers ( 2004 ) .",
    "the direct tr measurements are in general well reproduced by the simulations , but for the _",
    "_ sandwich _ and _ fiber _ radiator for momenta larger than 6gev / c the measured data points diverge from the saturated behavior predicted by the simulations .",
    "this is probably a systematic error connected with an underestimation of the sr background for higher momenta ( compare to fig . [ sr - mom ] ) . for the indirect measurement one expects a larger value for the total tr energy , due to the absorption of part of the tr in the helium pipe , etc .",
    "this is found also in the data at momenta up to 3gev / c , but at higher momenta the data shows no saturation and diverges from the prediction .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not understood in detail yet , but it certainly is of importance for a thorough understanding of the pion efficiencies achieved with the alice trd .",
    "an observed layer dependence of this effect points at tr buildup and/or bremsstrahlung from the different detector layers .",
    ".,width=302 ]    in this section we investigate the mean total observed tr energy for the different radiators scaled with their radiation length : @xmath44 .",
    "the radiation length is a scaling variable for the probability of occurrence of bremsstrahlung and pair production , and for the variance of the angle of multiple scattering in the detector material . since",
    "many transition radiation detectors are also used in experiments where track reconstruction of the particles is essential , a good tr performance should not be achieved at the expense of larger material budget . as we can see from fig .",
    "[ etrntr - mom - x0 ] , the good tr performance of the thicker regular radiator _",
    "reg2 _ is achieved at the expense of about twice the radiation length ; this is the reason why in this context the performance of _ reg2 _ is surpassed by _ reg1_. the _ sandwich _ radiator is not performing as well as the other radiators , which is due to the additional components used in its construction ( carbon fiber coating , epoxy and aluminized mylar foil ) . in the case of the alice trd",
    ", the radiators also serve the purpose of reinforcing the large area detectors against the gas overpressure , the weight of the xe gas and the forces due to the sum of wire tensions . due to the low radiation length , pure fibers  as used in atlas@xcite  should be considered an attractive solution for tracking trds .",
    "we have measured energy spectra of transition radiation ( tr ) for two regular foil and some irregular radiators ( _ fiber _ , _ foam _ , _ sandwich _ ) for electrons in the momentum range from 1 to 10gev / c with drift chambers operated with xe , co@xmath0(15% ) .",
    "we used prototypes of the drift chambers to be used in the transition radiation detector ( trd ) of the alice experiment at cern .",
    "we extracted cluster number distributions and found that they can be approximated by poisson distributions .",
    "we observe a systematic increase of the measured photon yield as a function of momentum .",
    "this can be explained by synchrotron radiation , which is created by electrons in the magnetic field used to deflect the beam .",
    "the assumption that the increase of this photon background with momentum is due to synchrotron radiation is well explained by simulations . after subtracting this background ,",
