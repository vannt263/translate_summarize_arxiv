    "@xmath11 is the regular representation of @xmath0 .",

    "he conjectured the same is true for any @xmath18 , and it is still an open problem .",
    "anyhow , it seems reasonable to consider @xmath5 as a first candidate for crepant resolutions of @xmath2 .",
    "now we explain the mckay correspondence .",
    "we first recall the @xmath19-dimensional situation . as @xmath5 is the minimal resolution of @xmath15 , it is well - known that the exceptional set consists of projective lines intersecting transversely .",

    "our new point is to consider the grothendieck group of bounded complexes of algebraic vector bundles with supports contained in @xmath42 , denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "there are natural elements @xmath44 of @xmath43 which are also indexed by irreducible representations as follows .",
    "the multiplication of the coordinate functions @xmath45 on @xmath6 induces the @xmath0-equivariant homomorphism ( called _ tautological homomorphism _ ) @xmath46 where @xmath24 is the @xmath47-dimensional representation given by the inclusion @xmath40 .",

    "the usage of both @xmath37 and @xmath43 are quite essential in the argument .",

    "as we explained , we need this assumption to show the exactness of the analogue of the koszul complex , more precisely , the condition  .",
    "when @xmath0 is abelian , we can use the torus action so that we need to check for very specific ideals . the idea to use the torus action is due to nakamura  @xcite who used it to prove the smoothness of @xmath5 .    by the way , the correspondence between ( b ) and ( c ) was further developed by the second author  @xcite .",
    "he constructed irreducible integrable representations of the affine lie algebra on the homology group of moduli spaces of instantons on @xmath5 .",

    "another quotient is the _",
    "hilbert quotient _ which is obtained by replacing the symmetric product by the hilbert scheme as follows : consider the induced @xmath0-action on @xmath66 . if @xmath74 is a fixed point , then @xmath11 is a @xmath0-module .",

    "since @xmath9 is invariant under @xmath0 , its support consists of a union of @xmath0-orbits .",
