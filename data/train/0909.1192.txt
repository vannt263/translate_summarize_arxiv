    "ultracold atoms and molecules with large permanent dipole moments are currently attracting much interest , since they allow realization of quantum gas systems with long - range interactions .",
    "major steps into this direction have already been done .",
    "references @xcite reported strong dipolar effects in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath1cr , which possesses a large permanent magnetic dipole moment of comparable strength as the usual @xmath0 interaction .",
    "even more promising are ultracold molecules of two different atomic species , since they have much larger permanent electric dipole moments @xcite .",
    "they have already been produced by means of radio - frequency ( rf ) spectroscopy @xcite and brought into the lowest internal vibrational ground state by means of a stimulated raman adiabatic passage @xcite .",
    "what remains is to cool these gases down into the quantum degenerate regime .",
    "many new effects have been predicted for ultracold quantum gases with dipole - dipole interactions ( ddis ) , which are based on the long range and anisotropy of the ddi . among others ,",
    "we mention the stabilization of a dipolar bec in a pancake - shape trap @xcite , the roton - maxon character of the excitation spectrum @xcite , new exotic quantum phases in optical lattices @xcite , and the transfer of spin into angular momentum similar to the einstein  de haas effect in ferromagnets @xcite . apart from that",
    ", the shape and strength of the intermolecular interactions may be controlled by means of static electric and microwave fields @xcite , and even three - body interactions may be realized in optical lattices @xcite . moreover , novel quantum computation schemes are proposed with ultracold dipolar molecules @xcite .    in this article , we discuss different interaction regimes of a quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) dipolar bose gas , in which the permanent dipole moments are aligned by an external field , such that the effective 1d ddi is repulsive . thus far , theoretical studies of 1d dipolar bosons found correlations @xcite beyond those in a tonks - girardeau ( tg ) gas @xcite and excitations @xcite , which can be described within the luttinger liquid framework @xcite .",
    "we show that the @xmath2 potential used in these references , which is valid in traps of zero transverse width , gives rise to an infinitely strong @xmath0 peak at equal particle positions , even for the infinitesimal strength of the ddi , due to its singular behavior at @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the 1d bose system forms a tg gas for very weak interactions @xcite .",
    "we use a 1d ddi potential that accounts for the finite width of the trap and is hence finite at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we show that this potential acts like a @xmath0 peak of finite strength , when the trap anisotropy is large .",
    "this allows for a regime of weakly @xmath0-interacting bosons below the tg regime . in the different interaction regimes ,",
    "we analyze the contributions to the total energy , the particle density , the momentum , and occupation number distribution of the particles in the harmonic trap .",
    "different features of the momentum distribution and the associated kinetic energy are related to the correlations between the particles .",

    "[ fig - dimensionless-1d - ddi ] .",
    "the second - quantized many - particle hamiltonian is then @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 are bosonic creation ( annihilation ) operators for one particle in energy eigenstate @xmath29 of the axial harmonic oscillator and where @xmath30 are dimensionless interaction integrals .",
    "these integrals are integrated numerically for different @xmath31 . the hamiltonian matrix ( [ eq - hamiltonian ] ) is diagonalized in the subspace of the energetically lowest eigenstates of the noninteracting many - particle problem .",
    "we solve numerically the many - body schrdinger equation with the interaction of eqs .",
    "( [ eq-1d - ddi])([eq - dimensionless-1d - ddi ] ) , but to gain some intuitive understanding let us first analyze the interaction potential .",

    "the 1d ddi is maximally attractive with @xmath37 , and for @xmath38 , it is maximally repulsive with @xmath39 . in the following ,",

    "thus , for large distances @xmath43 , the effective 1d ddi is given by @xmath44 with the long - range interaction strength @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",

    "[ fig - dimensionless-1d - ddi ] suggests that @xmath47 becomes a @xmath0 peak for small @xmath31 .",

    "we conclude that at short distances @xmath55 @xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "it follows that the strengths of the short- and long - range parts of the 1d ddi scale differently with the trap anisotropy @xmath59 , @xmath60 which means that the short - range part of the interaction is strongly enhanced by a tight transverse confinement compared to the long - range part . particularly in the limit @xmath61 ,",
    "the effective 1d ddi is not only given by @xmath62 at @xmath63 , but there is an additional infinitely strong @xmath0 peak at @xmath3 .",
    "consider , for example , the situation of a rather small @xmath64 and a trap anisotropy of @xmath65 .",
    "then , the strength of the @xmath0 peak is @xmath66 , which is already so large that bosons form a tg gas .",
    "this decomposition of the 1d ddi is valid as long as the ground state is a slowly varying function along the axial direction on the transverse length scale @xmath31 . in the following we fix the trap anisotropy according to @xmath67 so that this condition is always fulfilled .",
    "this corresponds to the maximal trap anisotropy , which has been achieved in the experiment of kinoshita _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where @xmath68hz and @xmath69khz leading to max@xmath70 .    in sec .",
    "[ results ] , we perform a sweep of @xmath32 , which can be done by changing the angle @xmath71 between @xmath72 and @xmath73 . as mentioned before , we neglected the short - range van der waals interaction , since we are interested in a study of the effect of the 1d ddi alone .",
    "these relations , which we derived within the single - mode approximation , are true as long as @xmath74 @xcite , where @xmath75 . by taking @xmath76k@xmath77rb polar molecules with an electric dipole moment of @xmath78debye and @xmath79khz ,",
    "the condition is fulfilled for @xmath80 .",
    "however , weak dipole moments may largely influence the 1d scattering in the regime @xmath81 , which was shown in a theory that accounts for the short - range van der waals interaction and goes beyond the single - mode approximation @xcite . to study the effect of the 1d ddi alone in that regime ,",
    "one may tune @xmath82 to zero using a feshbach resonance for fixed @xmath71 and @xmath17 and change @xmath16 .",
    "an increase of @xmath16 , for example , would decrease @xmath83 and increase @xmath84 .",
    "let us now turn to our results for four particles obtained by means of a numerical diagonalization of ( [ eq - hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig - energy - contributions ] shows the contributions to the total energy as a function of @xmath85 ( lower scale ) and @xmath86 ( upper scale ) , respectively , in a double logarithmic plot for a trap anisotropy of @xmath67 .",
    "both scales are related to each other through @xmath87 . shown",
    "are the energies of bosons with ddi ( solid ) and @xmath0 interaction ( dash - dotted ) and of fermions with ddi ( dotted ) .",
    "one sees that all energy contributions of bosons with ddi agree with those of @xmath0-interacting bosons for @xmath88 ; that is , in this region the bosons feel only the short - range @xmath0 part of the ddi .",
    "hence , it is more illuminative to use the upper scale here .",
    "the transition behavior in this interaction regime has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( for other trap geometries , see @xcite ) : the system evolves from a weakly interacting quasi - bec via an intermediate regime to a tg gas . already at @xmath89 ,",
    "the bosons are fermionized , which is indicated by a saturation of the total energy . in the shaded region ,",
    "the system does not react to a further increase of the interaction strength , which shows that the bosons do not feel the long - range part of the ddi , which is of the order of @xmath85 at distance @xmath90 .",
    "however , when the ddi is increased above the critical value @xmath91 , the fermionized bosons are further pushed apart from each other by the long - range @xmath2 tail of the ddi .",
    "an obvious signature of these beyond - tg correlations is the rapid increase of the interaction energy , indicating that the @xmath2-tail of the ddi has significant overlap with the many - body wave function .",
    "clearly , since the bosons are fermionized , all the energy contributions coincide with those of fermions with ddi in this region .",
    "another interesting aspect concerns the kinetic energy , which decreases in the @xmath2-tail - dominated regime , while all the other energy contributions grow with increasing repulsion .",
    "we attribute this behavior to the short - range correlations of the wave function , which can be approximated by @xcite @xmath92 in the tg regime , the luttinger exponent is @xmath93 , which leads to a large gradient of the many - body wave function at @xmath94 .",
    "this gives rise to a rather large kinetic energy in these regions of the configuration space . with increasing long - range interactions ,",
    "the luttinger exponent decreases , @xmath95 @xcite , which diminishes the gradient and hence the kinetic energy at @xmath94 . for even stronger long - range interactions ,",
    "the many - body wave function can alternatively be approximated by localized gaussian - like wave packets @xcite . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - density ] , the repulsion between the bosons mainly increases the distance between the center points of the wave packets , which has no influence on the kinetic energy .",
    "hence , we expect a saturation of the kinetic energy for very strong repulsion , which eventually becomes negligible compared to the other energy contributions ; see fig .",
    "[ fig - energy - contributions ] .",
    "the main message of fig .  [ fig - energy - contributions ] is the distinction of three interaction regimes . in the left region ,",
    "the bosons feel a @xmath0 potential of finite strength ; in the middle region , the bosons feel an infinitely strong @xmath0 potential and thus fermionize ; and in the right region , the system is dominated by the long - range @xmath2 part of the ddi .",
    "the right boundary of the middle region is independent of the trap anisotropy @xmath59 , but the left boundary moves to the left when @xmath59 is increased , and in the limit @xmath96 , the left region is absent . on the other hand , for very low trap anisotropies",
    ", the width of the middle region shrinks to zero . in fermi systems ,",
    "the left interaction regime is absent , since fermions do not feel the @xmath0 part of the ddi .    since the two @xmath0-interaction - dominated regimes have already been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we concentrate in the following on the @xmath2-tail - dominated regime .",
    "figure  [ fig - density ] shows localization of the particles with increasing long - range interaction . in the tg regime ,",
    "the particles are rather close together , and the minor oscillations visible in the top left density of fig .",
    "[ fig - density ] disappear for large particle numbers @xmath97 .",
    "with increasing long - range interaction , the density resembles four overlapping localized wave packets , which move apart from each other .",
    "the equilibrium positions of the wave packets minimize the potential and interaction energy ( the kinetic energy is negligible ) .",
    "occurrence of this quasiordered state was identified in the homogeneous system by means of the correlation function @xcite and the static structure factor @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is the momentum distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig - momentum - distribution ] ) , which is different for bosons and fermions in the tg regime ( in contrast to the energies and densities ) .",
    "one sees that both distributions become equal for strong long - range repulsion .",
    "this reveals that the statistics of the particles become unimportant if there is no significant overlap between the wave packets of the individual particles .    in the tg regime ( fig .",
    "[ fig - momentum - distribution ] , top left ) , the bosonic momentum distribution exhibits a high zero - momentum peak and long - range high - momentum tails ( this is more clearly visible in ref .",
    "the high - momentum tails originate from the cusps in the tg wave function at @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "note that although the bosonic and fermionic distributions are markedly different in the tg regime , their kinetic energy @xmath98 is equal .",
    "this shows that the high - momentum tails ( and hence the short - range correlations ) contribute significantly to the kinetic energy .    with increasing repulsion",
    ", the zero - momentum peak of the bosonic distribution significantly decreases and the high - momentum tails vanish , which indicates a redistribution from low and high toward medium momenta . finally , for very strong repulsion ( fig .",
    "[ fig - momentum - distribution ] , bottom right ) , the bosonic and fermionic distributions are only marginally different .",
    "the broad gaussian distribution of the crystalline state is essentially the fourier transform of the wave packets of fig .",
    "[ fig - density ] , like in the mott insulator phase in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "we close our discussion with fig .",
    "[ fig - occupation - number - distribution ] , which shows the occupation number distribution of the 1d harmonic oscillator states . as in the case of the momentum distribution",
    ", one sees that the bosonic and fermionic distributions become equal for strong long - range repulsion . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the distribution exhibits two features : a sharp peak with a maximum population of the first excited harmonic oscillator state and a broad distribution over the states @xmath100 with a maximum at @xmath101 .",
    "the broad maximum shifts to larger @xmath102 when @xmath85 is further increased .",
    "we analyzed several microscopic ground - state properties of few dipolar bosons in a 1d harmonic trap .",
    "the interaction between the bosons was modeled by a 1d potential , which was obtained from the three - dimensional ddi potential by an integration over the transverse directions within the single - mode approximation . for large trap anisotropies , the 1d",
    "ddi acts on the ground state like the sum of a short - range @xmath0 and a long - range @xmath2 potential . depending on the relative strength of both contributions , the system forms a weakly interacting quasi - bec , a tg gas , or a solidlike state of particles , which are localized due to the strong long - range repulsion .",
    "the transition from the tg gas to the solidlike state was clearly visible in the momentum distribution . with increasing interaction , one observes a redistribution from low and high toward medium momenta .",
    "the disappearance of the high - momentum tails ( and hence the short - range correlations ) is responsible for the decrease of the kinetic energy .",
    "for very strong repulsion , the momentum distribution has a broad gaussian shape and is essentially the fourier transform of the localized wave packets .",
    "in contrast to the kinetic energy , the interaction and the potential energy grow rapidly with increasing repulsion in the solidlike state .",
