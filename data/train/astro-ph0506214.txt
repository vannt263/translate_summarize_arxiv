    "early galaxies must have formed at a very low metallicity .",

    "these early galaxies are difficult to study because they are so distant . as a result ,",
    "nearby low - metallicity galaxies have generated considerable interest as local analogs of young galaxies at high redshift ( see , for example , the review by * ? ? ?",

    "an important aspect of infrared galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) is the behavior between 3 and 24 , a range that includes emission from pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) molecules and warm dust . at redshifts between 1 and 3 ,",
    "the pah features move through the mips 24um band . _",
    "ad hoc _ adjustments to this spectral region in sed models @xcite have been required to fit the 24  number counts @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that infrared luminous galaxies at z @xmath5 0.6 are only @xmath5 50% as metal - rich as their local analogs .",
    "therefore , interpreting the behavior of galaxies detected with _",

    "2005 , submitted to apj ) depends critically on understanding the effects of metallicity on the 24@xmath6 m flux densities for 1 @xmath7 z @xmath7 3 .",
    "low - metallicity galaxies are difficult to find : i  zw  18 , the first extreme example identified @xcite remains the lowest - metallicity galaxy yet found , despite 3 decades of searching .",
    "low - metallicity galaxies have had little or no star formation up to the present epoch and are therefore of very low luminosity . as a result",
    ", most existing compilations of the mir properties of galaxies are restricted to high - metallicity , high - luminosity targets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . where low - metallicity galaxy spectra have been obtained , though , they differ dramatically from their higher - metallicity cousins in their infrared properties , with hotter large - grain dust emission and weak pah emission @xcite .",
    "this work greatly expands the sample of low - metallicity galaxies observed in the infrared , to explore the effects of metallicity on the infrared properties of galaxies in a systematic way .",
    "the larger sample has allowed us to pinpoint the metallicity at which the transition from weak to strong pah emission occurs .",
    "the new data presented here were obtained using irac and mips .",
    "the irac data are all standard pipeline reductions using the most recent versions available in the archive , ranging from 9.5.0 to 10.5.0 .",
    "the mips data were reduced using the mips dat ( data analysis tool ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "photometry was performed using the `` imexam '' and `` imstat '' tasks in iraf .",
    "most sources in the sample are compact ; in general , apertures large enough to encompass all the flux were used for mips , while the standard aperture with a radius of 10 pixels ( 12 ) was used for irac , as suggested in the irac data handbook . for the extended galaxies , matching apertures that include the whole galaxy were used for mips and irac , and extended - source corrections",
    "have been applied to the irac measurements as described in the irac data handbook .",
    "no color corrections were applied , which should not have a strong impact on the results since the corrections listed in the irac and mips handbooks are typically only a few percent .    to increase the number of metal - rich galaxies in the sample , we have supplemented our measurements with results from the literature .",
    "where irac and mips measurements were available , they have been taken directly from the sources indicated in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we have synthesized irac and mips measurements from an irs ( infrared spectrograph ; * ? ? ? * ) measurement of ngc  7714 by @xcite by convolving the spectrum with the irac 8  and mips 24  spectral response curves available on the ssc ( _ spitzer _ science center ) website .",
    "finally , we have added several measurements from msx ( midcourse space experiment ) by @xcite and iras ( infrared astronomical satellite ) by @xcite .",
    "the msx band a ( 8.28 ) and irac 8  flux densities measured for two galaxies ( m  101 , k. gordon , in preparation ; m  83 , c. engelbracht , in preparation ) are very similar ( within 20% in both cases ) , so we have made no correction to the msx measurements used in this paper . we have made an empirical color correction from the iras 25  band to the mips 24  band by comparing the measured flux densities of ngc  7331 @xcite , m  81 @xcite , ngc  55 @xcite , and m  101 ( k. gordon , in preparation ) .",
    "the measured 24  to 25  ratios ranged from 0.81 to 0.94 , so we applied the average value , 0.87 , to all the iras measurements incorporated into the flux density ratio measurements in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the resulting sample is a heterogeneous collection of star - forming galaxies without strong active nuclei .",
    "the global photometry measurements make this sample suitable for comparison to high - redshift samples ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where only flux measurements integrated over the whole galaxy are feasible .",
    "the metallicity quoted for each galaxy generally applies to a much smaller beam than for the infrared data .",
    "the outer regions of each galaxy should have lower metallicity than the nuclei .",
    "thus , the beam mismatch would , if anything , weaken the trend of infrared properties we see clearly in the suite of measurements .",
    "we conclude it is not an impediment to this study .",
    "to explore the contribution of pah emission to the 8  band , we compare the 8  measurements to bands at both shorter and longer wavelengths .",
    "the longer - wavelength 24  band is already dominated by emission by dust and so we use it directly , but the shorter - wavelength 5.8 and 4.5bands can contain significant contributions from pah emission and starlight , respectively . to avoid contamination from pah features , we do not use the 5.8  band to derive the dust continuum measurement .",
    "we instead use the 4.5  band , from which we subtract the stellar component as follows : we assume the 3.6  band is dominated by starlight ( which may result in an underestimate of the 4.5  dust emission by a few percent ; cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and multiply the 3.6  measurement by the 4.5/3.6ratio expected for the stellar population , derived from starburst99 @xcite data files available on the web . the ratio predicted by that model is typically 0.53 to 0.61 , depending on star formation history and metallicity .",
    "we adopt the average value of 0.57 and assign to it an uncertainty of 7% .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this ratio as @xmath8 .",
    "our adopted value of @xmath8 is similar , but not identical to , the value of 0.47 in the template elliptical galaxy spectrum used by @xcite to measure the hot dust component in a sample of galaxies .",
    "this will have some effect on our measurement of the 4.5  dust component for specific galaxies but does not affect the conclusions we draw from a diagnostic plot , as we discuss below .",
    "the scaled 3.6  measurement is then subtracted from the 4.5  measurement . for the galaxies in this sample ,",
    "the scaled 3.6  measurement ranges from 26% to 96% of the 4.5measurement , with an average value of 70% .",
    "we did not subtract the stellar contribution from the 8  and 24measurements because the correction is small for these galaxies and has no impact on our conclusions . using the same starburst99 models as above",
    ", we derive that the stellar contribution at 8  ranges from 1% to 30% with an average of 10% and the contribution at 24  is negligible , less than 1% on average .",
    "the 8  measurements compared to the short and long wavelength bands are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] , where the ratio to the 4.5  band is referred to as @xmath9 and the ratio to the 24  band as @xmath10 .",
    "increasing levels of pah emission will result in decreasing values of @xmath9 and increasing values of @xmath10 .",
    "we note that any correction for dust in the 3.6  band will tend to increase the calculated 4.5  dust emission and therefore increase the value of @xmath9 for those galaxies without strong pah emission .",
    "the color measurements are presented graphically in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the figure shows that galaxies with high values of @xmath9 tend to have low values of @xmath10 , while those galaxies with a value of @xmath9 in the range of 0.01 to 0.09 ( similar to our galaxy ; cf .",
    "* ) tend to have larger values of @xmath10 , although with a large dispersion .",
    "we find that the separation of galaxies in this plot persists if we change our assumptions about how to compute the 4.5  dust continuum , e.g. , by changing the value of @xmath8 to 0.47 to match the value used by @xcite or by using near - infrared data ( such as the j band , which should not have a contribution from hot dust ) to determine the stellar contribution to the 4.5  band .",
    "this trend is consistent with the spectroscopic results summarized in the `` pah '' column of table  [ tab1 ] , which demonstrate that all the galaxies with spectra free of pah emission cluster in the upper - left portion of the diagram .    to interpret these results",
    ", we used the sed models of @xcite . to compute photometry from the models ( which do not contain a stellar emission component ) , we convolved them with the same spectral response curves discussed in ",
    "[ sec : data ] .",
    "the various flux density ratios were then computed as for the data .",
    "the emission in the irac bands derived from these models is dominated by a fixed pah spectral template , and as a result the models have a nearly constant value of @xmath9 , around 0.025 .",
    "the models cover a range of @xmath10 values that depends on the temperature of the thermally pulsing grains , along the locus of points _ outside _ the region to the upper left occupied by the pah - free galaxies .",
    "thus , the weakness of the 8  emission relative to the other bands appears to be due to the weakness of the pah emission relative to the emission from small dust grains .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the 8-to-24@xmath6 m color vs. metallicity ( the solar metallicity on this scale is 8.7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we label the galaxies according to the lack or presence of 8  pah emission using the color separation from figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "they separate very cleanly according to metallicity , with a narrow transition region around @xmath0 to @xmath1 solar metallicity .",
    "one additional galaxy , ngc 1569 , has been shown to have weak pah emission @xcite and has an o / h - based metallicity 25% of solar , consistent with this overall behavior .",
    "the boundary between metallicities with and without pah emission is surprisingly sharp , and it seems likely that future studies will show more scatter .",
    "for example , there can be significant variations in metallicity within these systems ( e.g. , a factor of three is indicated for sbs  0335 - 052 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our characterization of this parameter with a single value is an oversimplification .",
    "in addition , `` metallicity '' includes enrichment of the ism with a broad variety of elements , produced in different ways .",
    "oxygen is produced predominantly in very massive stars ; use of other elements produced in other ways as metallicity indicators may yield different behavior . nonetheless , there is a robust trend toward low pah emission in galaxies with relatively unpolluted isms",
    ".    why do the pah features become weaker in low - metallicity galaxies ?",
    "we reject extinction as a possible cause , both because the effect would have to ( counterintuitively ) become stronger in galaxies with lower heavy - element abundance ( and presumably less dust ) and because the direct measurement of extinction in the low - metallicity galaxy sbs  0335 - 052 shows it to be optically thin in the mir @xcite .",
    "it is also unlikely that starburst activity ( i.e. , the intensity of the star formation ) is a major contributor to the effect : the correlation coefficient between @xmath10 and the 24  surface brightness ( an indicator of the specific star formation rate , which we estimated from the integrated flux densities and the visible extent of the galaxies in the sample ) is much lower than the correlation coefficient between @xmath10 and the metallicity ( 0.26 vs. 0.79 ) . also , while the well - known starburst galaxies in our sample ( e.g. , ngc  253 , ngc  7714 ) , do tend to have lower @xmath10 values than other galaxies at similar metallicity , none of them have as small an @xmath10 value as the lowest metallicity galaxies .",
    "one possible reason is the destruction of the pah carrier in the harsh radiation field of a low - metallicity galaxy @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that these galaxies are truly young and the pah molecules have simply not had time to form @xcite .",
    "for example , it is well known that the ism of a galaxy must be significantly polluted with oxygen ( produced copiously in very massive stars ) before significant amounts of carbon are produced ( by stars of a few m@xmath11 )  this effect may delay pah production ( e. dwek , private communication ) .",
    "the low - metallicity galaxies may simply lack the carbon - rich agb stars required to form the pah molecules @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the pah features included in the @xcite models fail to account for the high values of @xmath9 prevalent at low metallicity ( i.e. , below 8.0 ) .",
    "the emission by dust in the models below 10  is several orders of magnitude lower than the emission from the pah template ( which does not vary ) , so the simple remedy to the models of weakening the pah spectrum does not allow them to match the low - metallicity data .",
    "the value of @xmath9 derived from the model depends only on the shape of the pah template spectrum and does not match the low - metallicity galaxies shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ( i.e. , the model @xmath9 value plotted in figure  [ fig1 ] does not shift as the pah features are weakened ) . some other source of emission must be dominating in these sources , such as hot dust in the 4.5  band ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "we have combined new mir measurements from the _ spitzer space telescope _ with results from the literature to show that the 8  to 24  flux density ratio in star - forming galaxies depends strongly on metallicity .",
    "the 8  to 24  color changes markedly between @xmath0 to @xmath1 solar metallicity  the mean ratio below @xmath0 solar metallicity is @xmath12 , while the ratio at higher metallicity is @xmath4 . a mir color - color diagram which compares the 8  band to dust continuum measurements at 4.5 and 24  shows that the change in the ratio is predominantly due to a decrease in the 8  emission .",
    "we interpret this result as a weakening of the pah features at low metallicity , an interpretation consistent with the spectroscopic evidence available in the literature .",
    "we show that existing empirical sed models can not account for the color change merely by weakening the pah component of the models .",
    "in addition to the dependence of pah strength on metallicity , sed models must account for another source of emission ( e.g. , hot dust ) to explain the irac observations of low - metallicity galaxy colors .",
    "the shift in 8 to 24  ratio occurs at a fairly high metallicity and will thus affect the spectra of many galaxies .",
    "future sed models to interpret _ spitzer _ measurements at high redshift must take the dependence of metallicity on redshift into account .    we thank eli dwek for helpful discussions , and nanyao lu and eiichi egami for comments which improved this paper .",
