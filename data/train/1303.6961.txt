    "in the past decades several new and rare types of extremely bright and peculiar supernovae have been discovered :    * the broad - line type ic supernovae ( abbreviated as sn ic - bl ) that are associated with long - duration grbs ( abbreviated as lgrbs ) .",
    "this was the first extremely bright type of supernovae discovered @xcite .",
    "they have no h and often also no he in their spectra and are characterized by extremely large outflow velocities ( @xmath0 km / s ) , implying very large kinetic energies ( @xmath1ergs ) . when they are associated with a lgrb ( also a number has been discovered that are not",
    ", see below ) they are related to the explosions of rapidly rotating almost pure co - stars with masses @xmath2 , almost bare cores of originally very massive stars @xcite , and the prototype sn1998bw / grb980425 ejected of order half a solar mass of @xmath3ni @xcite . since the discovery of the lgrb - related supernovae of type ic - bl , also non - grb supernovae of this type have been discovered , in general in low - redshift galaxies ( @xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "they are thought to have the same `` central engines '' that in lgrbs produce relativistic jets @xcite ; the jets are thought to be unable to penetrate the outer layers of the star , and to deposit their energy mostly inside the star , producing a sn ic - bl @xcite . * the so - called super - luminous supernovae ( slsn ) , a new class of supernovae discovered with the recent large - scale surveys for transients .",
    "the several tens of extremely energetic and bright slsne that are now known have bolometric luminosities up to some 50 times those of type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "there are at least three classes of slsn : the slsn - i which lack hydrogen in their spectra , the slsn - ii which do have h in their spectra and the slsn - r which have a long lightcurve tail powered by the radioactive decay of a very large amount of @xmath3ni , typically of order 5 ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "both the slsn and the lgrbs ( as well as their sn  ic - bl counterparts ) have in common that : ( 1 ) they are very rare : the rate of lgrbs ( @xmath5mpc@xmath6yr@xmath7 ) is some @xmath8 times lower than the core - collapse sn rate ( the non - grb snic - bl may be one to two orders of magnitude more common , e.g. see * ? ? ? * but still rare ) .",
    "the combined rate of the slsn is of order @xmath9mpc@xmath6yr@xmath7 , some 10@xmath10 times lower than the core - collapse sn rate .",
    "these rates imply that a rare type of stellar evolution is required to produce these events .",
    "( 2 ) both the lgrbs and slsn occur almost exclusively in small star forming galaxies ( smc / lmc - like or smaller ; the same appears to be true for the non - grb snic - bl @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that in 41 out of 42 studied lgrbs the host is a small star - forming galaxy .",
    "only one lgrb host is a grand - design spiral galaxy , and it was found that in their small hosts the grbs fall on optically bright spots .",
    "studies of nearby small starburst galaxies show that such bright spots are clumps of massive o- and wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "for example ngc 3125 has a number of such clumps with spectra that are a mixture of o- and wr spectra @xcite . studies of these clumps show that such small galaxies may harbour as many as @xmath11 o- and wr stars , which are concentrated in a small number ( 3 to 6 ) massive young star clusters , with masses of order @xmath12each , and each containing often @xmath13 o - stars .    the slsn share the property of the lgrbs to occur almost exclusively in small starburst galaxies .",
    "the only two slsn - ii that reside in larger milky way - type galaxies were found very close to the nucleus of their hosts @xcite .",
    "@xcite remarks that this `` _ suggests that to produce slsn perhaps special conditions are required that are unique to this environment ( e.g. circum - nuclear star - forming rings ) , somehow mimicking the conditions in star - forming dwarf galaxies .",
    "_ '' indeed , in the inner few hundred parsecs of the bulges of many larger galaxies , nuclear starbursts are going on .",
    "seyfert galaxies as well as our own galaxy are prime examples @xcite . within 100 pc from the centre of our galaxy",
    "many massive young star clusters are present , of which the arches and quintuplet clusters are key examples .",
    "these clusters in our galaxy s central region are massive , but even more important ( as we will argue in  [ sect : sc ] ) is their very high stellar density , which in the core of arches exceeds @xmath14/pc@xmath15 .",
    "such a high star density is also characteristic of the young clusters in small star - forming galaxies like the lmc and in the central regions of starburst galaxies like m82 @xcite .",
    "the lmc cluster r136 , in the 30 doradus region , has a high density .",
    "the reason why the clusters in small star - forming galaxies reach such high star densities may be related to the power in the turbulent velocity spectrum which leads to a shorter free - fall timescale of the gas than in the disks of large galaxies @xcite . in the high density star forming regions",
    "the trubulent energy spectrum is a power law @xmath16 in which @xmath17 @xcite rather than the usual @xmath18 ( with more power in the large scale gas motion ) .",
    "this is consistent with the results of hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of star clusters in which a turbulent velocity field with more power at small structures stimulate the formation of dense clusters .",
    "this effect can be observed in the population of star clusters in nearby galaxies , by fitting their number @xmath19 to the schechter function , which takes the form @xcite : @xmath20 the distribution of the masses of young ( @xmath21myr old ) star clusters in large quiescent galaxies , like m31 , are best represented by a schechter function with a characteristic mass @xmath22 and with an exponential fall - off of @xmath23 , whereas for dwarf starburst galaxies and interacting galaxies like m51 @xmath24 . in fig.[fig : mr_mwg_a ] ( see also  [ sect : origin ] ) we present the probability density function of cluster birth mass and size .",
    "the gray shades represent the convolution of the schechter mass function ( eq.[eq : schechter ] ) with a log - normal distribution for the cluster sizes . for the former we adopted @xmath23 and @xmath25 . for the log - normal size distbribution",
    "we adopted a mean cluster radius of 5pc with a dispersion of 3pc , which is consistent with the observed young ( @xmath21myr ) star clusters in the local group .",
    "we speculate that the dense torus of in - spiralling gas accumulating in the central few hundred pc of the bulges of spiral galaxies may also have a turbulent velocity structure , due to the high local star formation and associated high supernova rate .",
    "it therefore appears that both the lgrbs / sn ic - bl and the slsn solely occur in regions of galaxies where very dense young star clusters are present .",
    "this suggests that both types of objects could be the products of evolutionary processes that are unique to dense massive young star clusters , and do not occur anywhere else ( this suggestion for the lgrbs was casually made to one of us by s. kulkarni in 2006 ) .",
    "we present later in this paper ( see  [ sect : merger ] ) possible scenario of how this could come about and quantize the effect in  [ sect : sc ] and  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "but before that , in  [ sect : grb ] , we consider the boundary conditions set by the observations , for models for producing lgrbs / sn ic - bl .",
    "the general concensus on the conditions required for producing a long grb is the collapse of a very rapidly rotating almost bare co - core of a massive star .",
    "there is strong observational evidence that the grb is produced by a narrowly collimated relativistic jet with a lorentz - factor of order @xmath26 to @xmath8 .",
    "the beam opening half - angle of 5 to 10 degrees leads to a beaming fraction of order 0.003 .",
    "there are two models for producing such jets :    * according to the `` _ collapsar _ '' model of @xcite , in which a very massive rapidly rotating core collapses to a black hole , the core has so much angular momentum that not all of the core matter can at once disappear into the black hole .",
    "part of the core matter then temporarily forms a disk of nuclear matter around the black hole .",
    "viscous and/or magnetic dissipation in this disk drive , in combination with frame dragging , a relativistic jet which results in the grb @xcite ; * a model in which the very rapidly rotating core collapses to a strongly magnetized neutron star ( `` magnetar '' ) that is spinning with a period of order of a millisecond @xcite .",
    "the spindown energy loss by magnetic dipole emission and the relativistic wind of such an extreme `` pulsar '' is so gigantic that it will spin down to a long period on a timescale of minutes to hours and produce energetic electromagnetically powered relativistic jets along the rotation axis , and also blows up the star in a sn ic - bl ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "both these models require that in order to produce a lgrb , the collapsing massive co core must have high angular momentum , in the range @xmath27 to @xmath28 @xmath29/sec .",
    "since all sn ic - bl are thought to have the same central engine that produces highly relativistic jets ( see above ) , also the non - grb supernovae of this type must have collapsing co - cores with the same high angular momentum .",
    "two possible ways have been suggested for the core of a massive star to obtain such high angular momentum , either : ( a ) very low metallicity or ( b ) evolution in a close binary system . in the first type of models",
    "it is argued that low metallicity gives weak stellar winds  such that the winds do not carry off much angular momentum and the star keeps high angular momentum throughout its life .",
    "its rapid rotation in these models , keeps the star completely mixed , such that it evolves homogeneously and may in the end become a rapidly rotating co star that collapses .",
    "the requirement of very low metallicity is fulfilled for many of the host galaxies of lgrbs , but there are also several with almost solar metallicity @xcite and the requirement of low metallicity must be reconsidered @xcite .",
    "simultaneously , the hosts of the non - grb supernovae of type ic - bl tend to have low metallicity as well ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , some have metallicities as high as 1.7 to 3.5 times solar , while still having the same central engine @xcite",
    ". therefore it seems likely that low metallicity , although it appears to facilitate the production of a lgrb and sn  ic - bl , it is not the only factor involved in the production of these phenomena , which require a high angular momentum of the collapsing stellar core ( see below ) .      in close binary models  involving late evolutionary phases of normal massive binaries  tidal forces keep the star in synchronous ( rapid ) rotation , or a rapidly rotating merger product is produced (  helium merger grb ",
    "the main argument against these models , that involve the _ regular _ evolution of binaries that started out as `` normal '' massive systems , is that such binaries are found throughout the disks of all spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore , if these models would work , one would expect many lgrbs to be seen in disks of spiral galaxies ( since a large part of the present - day star formation is thought to take place in these galaxies , e.g.see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , contrary to what is observed .",
    "therefore , models based on _ normal _ massive binary evolution can not comply to the boundary conditions set by the environments where lgrbs / sn ic - bl are found .",
    "the main open questions that then remain are : ( 1 ) why do lgrbs ( and other engine - driven sn ic - bl ) occur in small star - forming galaxies ? , and ( 2 ) why do lgrbs have a preference for low metallicities , while not all sn  ic - bl share this preference ?",
    "we propose that the answers to these questions are that the rapidly rotating co - cores required for the engines of sn  ic - bl are solely produced in mergers of a special type of binaries that result from gravitational dynamical processes that occur only in dense young massive star clusters .",
    "it turns out that dynamical processes tend to produce close binaries with almost equal - mass components ( @xmath30 ) .    in order for both stars to have a helium - burning helium core at the time of the merger , the less massive star of the two",
    "should already have left the main sequence ( have exhausted hydrogen in its core ) while the more massive one should not yet have terminated core helium burning . by performing a series of stellar evolution calculations using mesa @xcite from amuse framework @xcite with solar ( @xmath31 ) and sub - solar ( @xmath32 ) metallicity , we find that the two stars should not differ more than 20 per cent in mass , although the result is somewhat mass dependent allowing a larger mass difference for more massive star : the mean of the minimum mass ratio is @xmath33 for solar metallicity and @xmath34 for subsolar .",
    "this poses a lower - limit for the required mass ratio .",
    "the merger of such a binary produces a rapidly rotating massive helium star , and we show that these stars at the time of core collapse can still have the required high core angular momentum , and that their event rates matches the observed rates of sn  ic - bl .",
    "the winds of helium stars ( wr stars ) carry off part of their original angular momentum .",
    "we show that because of the metallicity dependence of the wind mass - loss rates of wolf - rayet stars , at low metallicity high final core angular momentum occurs over a much larger range of helium star masses than at high metallicity .",
    "therefore this model favors the occurrence of lgrbs at low metallicity , but does not exclude high metalicities . an additional factor favouring low metallicity",
    "is that the helium merger product is more easily produced at low than at high metallicity ( see  [ sect : hestar ] ) .",
    "we used the models for the evolution of helium stars in the mass range 8 through 32 of @xcite and for larger mass values the models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* models computed with more recent evolution codes produce very similal results ) .",
    "the total lifetimes , helium - burning core masses , radii and luminosities of these models were adopted , and for other helium star mass values in the range 8 to 100 , these quantities were calculated by logarithmic inter- and extra - polation from these values as a function of the logarithm of mass .",
    "we assumed that at the time of the merger of the helium stars ( cores of their progenitors ) the merger product helium star is on the zero - age helium main sequence and is rotating with a break - up angular velocity @xmath35 .",
    "this is a natural consequence , because at the time of the merger the two helium cores are orbiting each other with keplerian velocities ; the merger therefore results in a single helium star rotating with a keplerian equatorial angular velocity , which is the maximum possible `` break - up '' rate .",
    "the assumption that they start on the zero - age helium main sequence implies that after their formation these stars have the longest possible lifetimes and therefore undergo the maximum possible amount of stellar - wind mass - loss ( and thus maximum angular - momentum loss ) that such a merger product can experience .",
    "( the real angular momentum loss of these merger products will therefore always be smaller than we calculate here , and their final core angular momentum will always be larger than we calculate here ) .",
    "for the wind mass - loss rates we adopted the metal - dependent mass - loss rates of wn - type wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars as given by :    @xmath36 } ) =       -12.95 + 1.5 \\log(l/{\\mbox{$l_\\odot$ } } )   + 0.86 \\log(z/{\\mbox{$z_\\odot$ } } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : wrwind}\\ ] ]    here @xmath37 and indicate the star s metallicity and the sun s metallicity , respectively .",
    "this mass - loss rate was adopted until the mass of the helium star had been reduced to the mass of the convective burning core which it had at the start of its evolution .",
    "since in this core carbon is produced , we assumed that from here on the wr star becomes a carbon type wc star .",
    "for these stars we adopted the wind mass - loss rates for wc stars given by @xcite .    for @xmath38 ,",
    "these rates are equal to the wn mass - loss rates given by eq.([eq : wrwind ] ) ; for @xmath39 they are 3 times the rate given by eq.([eq : wrwind ] ) for this metallicity , and for @xmath40 they are 6 times the rate given by eq.([eq : wrwind ] ) for this metallicity .",
    "we assumed the wind particles to carry off the angular momentum which they had at the surface of the star , and since the bulk of the masses of helium stars are convective , we assumed the stars to be rotating as a solid body until the moment of helium exhaustion in the convective core .",
    "after this , the contracting carbon - oxygen core will spin up , but its rotation will be braked by coupling to the layers around it . as a result",
    "it will lose part of the angular momentum it had at the time of the helium exhaustion .",
    "after the end of carbon burning , at the time of core collapse , it will still have a fraction @xmath41 of the specific angular momentum which it had at helium exhaustion .",
    "we adopted the values of @xmath41 as given by yoon ( 2006 , private communication ) , who calculated the evolution of rotating helium stars with masses between 8 and 40 using spruit s ( 2002 ) mechanism for core - envelope coupling .",
    "he found that the inner 3 of the co - cores of these stars at the moment of the core collapse have retained a fraction @xmath41 of their initial specific angular momentum which these had as a helium star in solid body rotation .",
    "these @xmath41-values are as follows : for @xmath4216 : @xmath43 ; for @xmath44 : @xmath45 ; for @xmath46 @xmath47 and for @xmath48 : @xmath49 . for all masses",
    "@xmath50 we adopted @xmath51 , and for other masses we estimated the @xmath41-values by logarithmic interpolation as a function of logarithm of the mass .",
    "the angular momentum of a star of mass @xmath52 and radius @xmath53 , rotating at angular velocity @xmath35 is : @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the radius of gyration of the star , which for helium stars is given by @xcite , as follows : for 8 , @xmath56 ; for 16 , @xmath57 and for @xmath58 and larger , @xmath59 . for masses between 8 and 32 the @xmath60-values",
    "were obtained by logarithmic interpolation between the above values .",
    "the angular momentum loss rate is @xmath61 on the other hand , @xmath62 in these equations , the radius @xmath53 of the star was assumed to be constant during the wr phase , and the right - hand side of eq.([eq : djdt ] ) represents the angular momentum loss from the stellar surface . for helium stars @xmath63 solar masses",
    "the radii indeed change little during the evolution ; for the higher masses the radii shrink somewhat in the course of helium burning , but as this leads to a spin - up of the star , the angular momentum loss rate from the surface will , in first approximation remain the same .",
    "we therefore ignored the radius evolution of the helium stars .",
    "combination of eqs.([eq : djdt_a ] ) and ( [ eq : djdt ] ) then leads to : @xmath64 integration yields : @xmath65 where the subscripts @xmath66 and @xmath41 indicate the initial and final situations , respectively , and the exponent has a value between 7 and 9 .",
    "although these exponents are large , our calculations below show that for low matallicity the value of @xmath67 remains close to unity over the range of masses .",
    "we applied this equation , in combination with the above - given @xmath41-values and the wind mass - loss rates and total lifetimes of the helium stars calculated as defined above .",
    "we started with helium stars rotating at their break - up values after their formation by a merger , and calculated the specific angular momentums @xmath68 of their collapsing cores at the end of the evolution , for three values of the metallicity : @xmath38 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 and for initial helium star masses in the range of 8100 .",
    "the resulting final specific angular momentum of the collapsing co cores for these three metallicities are depicted in figure [ fig : angularmomentum ] .",
    "( the discontinuities in the slope of the curves are in part caused by our interpolation methods combined with the sudden jumps of the @xmath41-values , @xmath60-values and values of some other quantities at certain helium star mass values as described above . )",
    "one observes that for solar metallicity the range in zero - age masses that have sufficient final core angular momentum for producing a gamma - ray burst is considerably smaller than for lower metallicity , but that high metallicities can not be excluded for supernova ic - bl progenitors . for low metallicity the range in zero - age mass increases , which is consistent with a higher proportion of gamma - ray bursts at lower metallicity .",
    "the curves show that for solar metallicity , the final specific angular momentum of the cores are sufficient for producing lgrb only in the helium - star mass range 816 , for @xmath71the allowed mass range is 8 to 38 , and for @xmath72the range has widened to 8 to 61 .",
    "we thus see that , in principle , ic - bl and lgrbs can according to this merger model , be produced at any metallicity , but that the mass range in which such events can be produced is much larger at low metallicity than at high metallicity .",
    "we speculate that this is the reason why lgrbs have a preference for occurring at low metallicity , but are still occasionally seen in a high - metallicity environment .",
    "we now consider dynamical processes in dense young star clusters that could produce these helium star merger and collision products that could power the engine of a sn ic - bl .",
    "our scenario concerns the merger of a dynamically - produced binary , consisting of two massive stars that at the time of the merger are in or on their way to core helium burning . to be simultaneously in this phase",
    ", the two stars should at the outset not differ much in mass . in the case of low metallicity",
    "the stellar - wind mass loss during the hydrogen - burning evolution of the stars will be small and the two stars will still have hydrogen - rich envelopes when they merge . during hydrogen shell burning",
    "these low - metalicity stars evolve to become red supergiants with very large radii .",
    "a binary contains insufficient room for such stars and a common envelope will ensue in which the two compact cores of the stars spiral towards each other and merge , forming a helium core that rotates near break - up ( i.e. with the maximum possible angular momentum ) . during the common - envelope phase the hydrogen - rich envelope",
    "is ejected , due to the release of a very large amount of gravitational binding energy by the shrinking of the binary orbit .    in the high - metallicity case",
    "the two massive stars will at the time of the merger already have lost their hydrogen - rich envelopes due to the strong stellar winds , and have become wolf - rayet stars , but the outcome of the merger will also be a critically rotating helium star . also such an object is expected to produce a sn ic - bl .",
    "however , to make the two stars merge at this phase requires an extra agent , since such hydrogen - poor stars ( wolf - rayet stars ) have small radii and are not expected to go into a common - envelope phase on their own accord . to make them merge ,",
    "a third companion to this binary is needed , which through the @xcite effect , in which the exchange of angular momentum between an inclined outer orbit and the tight inner orbit drives the latter to extremely high ( @xmath73 ) eccentricity .",
    "this evolution is likely to result in an off - center collision between the two wr stars , leading to a rapidly rotating helium star .",
    "both such types of almost - equal - mass systems , without and with a third companion are expected to be produced by dynamical interactions in dense young star clusters , as numerical studies of star - cluster evolution have shown .",
    "these studies show that in dense young star clusters the most massive stars rapidly sink to the cluster center , where they tend to form binary systems with components that are very close in mass @xcite .",
    "further dynamical interactions with cluster stars and binaries may lead to the expulsion of such a massive binary from the cluster , turning it into a runaway star @xcite .",
    "the very massive almost - equal - mass binary r145 near the lmc cluster r136 appears to be precisely such a kicked - out runaway binary @xcite ( also the equal - mass close binary y cygni , which consists of two equal mass b0 iv stars , in an eccentric 3-day orbit , is such a runaway star , of lower mass , in our own galaxy ; its cluster of origin is , however , not known , @xcite ) .",
    "these ejected binaries tend to be the ideal candidates for producing lgrb / sn ic - bl , and our model therefore predicts that lgrbs / sn ic - bl can also be found outside , though near ( at a distance @xmath74@xmath8pc ) massive star clusters .",
    "this appears indeed to be the case for some of the lgrbs / sn ic - bl , the prime example being grb 980425/sn 1998bw .",
    "the above scenario only works for clusters for which a massive star reaches the cluster core and pairs off in a binary before it leaves the main sequence .",
    "the most massive star @xmath75 in a cluster of mass @xmath76 is @xmath77 @xcite with a maximum of about 150 @xcite . in our case , however , the helium core of the most massive star , before merger , should be @xmath78 ( fig.[fig : angularmomentum ] ) , such that the two cores together form a helium star @xmath79 .",
    "this implies that the zams hydrogen - rich progenitors should have been less massive than about 6168 .",
    "( the range here reflects the uncertainty in the moment when the common - envelope ensues which translates in a range of core masses at the onset of roche - lobe overfow . )",
    "this corresponds to a cluster mass of 6200 to 7900 solar masses . in order to be able to form a binary the star has to sink from the cluster virial radius @xmath80 to the cluster center within its main - sequence life time",

    "repeated interactions with other cluster members drive the hardening of the binary to @xmath84kt . in a number of cases , such a binary in the cluster center may dynamically acquire a third companion , which later in life , through the @xcite effect , may lead to a collision of the inner pair .    in fig.[fig :",

    "based on our analysis we expect that the binary in trumpler 14 will eventually be ejected from the cluster center and produce a supernova at some distance away , but due to the high metallicity of tr14 , this explosion will probably not resemble a lgrb / sn  ic - bl .    according to our model each of these clusters are candidates for producing a sn ic - bl , each of which is expected to go off within the next 3myr totaling a rate of @xmath83/myr , or @xmath98 of the type ii supernova rate . in tab.[tab : rate ] we calculate the rate for supernova type sn  ic - bl from the galactic star cluster population and arrive at a theoretical upper limit of @xmath99 per year .",
    "dense clusters that are more massive than indicated by the left most blue curve in fig.[fig : mr_mwg ] but below the solid red curve are prone to producing an unusually massive star via a collision runaway . @xcite . in relatively compact @xmath100pc and low - mass star clusters @xmath10130,000 the collision runaway product can reach a mass of 150 to 260 @xcite .",
    "these stars collapse in a luminous pair - instability supernova , giving rise to a slsn - r , because these supernovae produce large amounts of @xmath3ni , as was proposed for sn2007bi by @xcite .",
    "the arches star cluster is located in the regime of forming a @xmath102 collision runaway star , which is in the range for leading to a pair instability supernova .",
    "over - plotted in fig.[fig : mr_mwg ] ( gray shades ) is the probability density function at which star clusters are born in the galaxy .",
    "the gray shading is identical to that in fig.[fig : mr_mwg_a ] , but reproduced here to complement the impression of cluster birth parameters ( in gray ) with the observed population of star clusters . for the size distribution of the clusters we fitted the observed distribution of cluster sizes ( taken from tabs 2 , 3 and 4 of ) to a log - normal distribution , which gave a satisfactory fit for a mean radius of 5pc and a dispersion of 3pc . for the initial mass function of young clusters we adopted a schechter function @xcite with a minimum mass of @xmath103 and a characteristic mass of @xmath104 .",
    "the exponential fall - off in the schechter mass function for spiral galaxies is @xmath105 ( see eq.[eq : schechter ] ) , whereas for dwarf starburst galaxies it is @xmath106 .",
    "this difference in shape of the mass function , together with the adopted variation is the size distribution gives rise to a dramatic difference in the densities for these clusters ( see tab.[tab : rate ] ) .    in sufficiently dense star clusters of @xmath107",
    "the collision runaway can grow to a mass @xmath108 ( in fig.[fig : mr_mwg ] the area to the right of the right - most solid blue curve and below the sold red curve ) .",
    "we speculate that these extremely massive stars produce slsn - i / ii by collapsing to a black hole of intermediate mass @xcite .",
    "the mass of the collision runaway can reach values of up to a few @xmath8@xcite . by the time the star experiences a supernova it has shed most of its mass again in a dense stellar wind and it is uncertain how much mass eventually collapses to the black hole @xcite . integrating over the mass and size distributions for star clusters we derive a rate of @xmath109 for the milky - way population . by adopting the same size distribution and mass distribution of star clusters as we did before for the population of clusters in blue - compact dwarf galaxies",
    "we arrive at a rate of @xmath110 , which is somewhat smaller than the observed rate for combined types slsn - i and slsn - ii .",
    "we can calculate event rates for supernovae type ic - bl , type slsn - r and slsn - i / ii by integrating the probability density function of star cluster birth parameters and over galaxy types .",
    "the integrated rates for a large spiral galaxy and dwarf starburst galaxies are presented in tab.[tab : rate ] .",
    "the supernova type ic - bl are calculated by integrating the area below the dashed red curve in fig.[fig : mr_mwg ] . because it is in our model the most massive star in a cluster that pairs off and produces a supernova type ic - bl",
    ", we adopt an upper limit for the most massive star in the cluster , and integrate up to that cluster mass .    according to our analysis",
    "presented in fig.[fig : angularmomentum ] , the appropriate helium core mass for each of the merging stars should be at most @xmath111 , 16 and 30 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "such core masses are reached in zero - age main - sequence stars of at least 2326 , 4248 and 6168 .",
    "this mass relates to the most massive star born in clusters , which then should not exceed of 700900 27003600 and 62007900 , for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the lower metalicities correspond to the higher mass limits for the zero - age main - sequence stars and consequently also for the upper limit in the cluster mass range ; supernova type ic - bl are expected to occur in relatively low - mass ( @xmath112 ) star clusters .    in tab.[tab :",
    "rate ] we compare the relative rates for lgrb / sn  ic - bl as a function of metallicity with the metallicity dependency in the observed rates , using statistics of lgrbs by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "although this statistics contains only 14 lgrbs the number of low ( with an oxygen abundance of @xmath113 counting 5 lgrbs ) , medium ( 7 ) and high ( @xmath114 with 2 lgrbs ) metallicity pose an interesting relation which can be compared with our model calculations .",
    "the total relative rate for lgrb / sn  ic  bl was fixed at @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "the event rate for supernova type slsn - i / ii is calculated by integrating the area below the solid red curve and to the right of the right - most solid blue curve , and the type slsn - r rate is obtained by integrating between the two solid blue curves and below the solid red curve .",
    "we normalized to the supernova type  ii rate by counting the number of stars between 8 and 25 , and we adopted a minimum cluster mass of 150 .",
    "the relative rates for the various types of supernovae are presented in tab.[tab : rate ] .",
    "the rate of the various events for a galaxy similar to the milky way are more than one order of magnitude lower than the observed rate or the rate derived for compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "the relative proportion of star formation in these various types of galaxies may easily be an order of magnitude , major spiral galaxies dominating this rate . in that case",
    ", the rate for supernova type ic - bl may still be dominated by large spiral galaxies compared to compact dwarf galaxies , but for the superluminal supernovae this does not pose a discrepancy .",
    "the difference in the observed rates of types slsn - i / ii compared to slsn - r is about an order of magnitude , whereas in our models they are comparable",
    ". the relative ratio between slsn - i / ii and slsn - r can easily be tuned by moving the boundaries in runaway mass between producing a slsn - r and a slsn - i / ii . adopting a lower limit to the mass of the collision runaway to produce a slsn - i / ii of @xmath116 ( instead of 260 )",
    "would solve this discrepancy .",
    "we do not explicitly make the distinction between type slsn  i and type ii , but derive the total rate . upon each collision several of hydrogen",
    "is injected into the collision runaway , but this mass is blown away in the copious stellar wind in a few @xmath11 years . a collision between the runaway and a hydrogen rich star shortly before the supernova of the former was proposed by @xcite to explain the slsn - ii 2006gy which occurred close to the nucleus of a large galaxy @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the timescale on which fresh hydrogen is injected into the collision runaway and the time required to deplete the newly acquired hydrogen envelope determines the ratio of slsn type ii relative to slsn type is .",
    "the observed comparable rates of type slsn - ii relative to slsn - i is consistent with this regime of collisional growth @xcite .",
    "both the rates for slsn - r and for slsn - i / ii increase if a higher proportion of star clusters are born with high density , like is the case for clusters in blue - compact dwarf galaxies compared to the milky - way .",
    "the intermediate - mass black hole that forms through a slsn - i / ii is expected to be located in the dense core of a collapsed star cluster . in the core of such a star cluster the intermediate mass a black hole is likely to be accompanied by another star , or otherwise it is likely to acquire one within a core relaxation time scale .",
    "the orbital period of such a binary typically is in the range of 50 to 500days @xcite .",
    "the observational repercussions of a massive black hole that is orbited by another massive star are profound , and could be characterised by a peculiar x - ray emission .",
    "the companion eventually will leave the main - sequence upon which roche - lobe overflow is likely to ensue .",
    "such a phase of mass transfers from the captured star to the intermediate - mass black hole may lead to an ultra luminous x - ray source , much like the observed systems m82",
    "x-1 @xcite , ngc1313 x-2 @xcite and hlx-1 @xcite , ngc5408 x-1 @xcite and ngc7479 x-1@xcite . the observed periodicity in m82 x-1 ( 62 days ) , ngc5408 x-1 ( 115days ) and hlx-1 ( 388days ) and their x - ray fluxes are consistent with a cluster member being captured by an intermediate mass black hole and feeding the latter via a dense stellar wind or roche - lobe overflow .",
