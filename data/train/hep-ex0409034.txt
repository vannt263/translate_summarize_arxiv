    "the radiative transition between charmonium states has been studied extensively by many authors  @xcite . in general , it is believed that @xmath14 is dominated by the @xmath11 transition , but with some @xmath12 ( for @xmath15 and @xmath0 ) and @xmath13 ( for @xmath0 ) contributions due to the relativistic correction .",
    "these contributions have been used to explain the big differences between the calculated pure @xmath11 transition rates and the experimental results  @xcite .",
    "they will also affect the angular distribution of the radiative photon .",
    "thus the measurement of the angular distribution may be used to determine the contributions of the higher multipoles in the transition .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath4 , the @xmath13 amplitude is directly connected with @xmath16-state mixing in @xmath1 which has been regarded as a possible explanation of the large leptonic annihilation rate of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "since recent studies  @xcite also suggest the @xmath18- and @xmath16-wave mixing of @xmath1 and @xmath17 may be the key to solve the longstanding `` @xmath19 puzzle '' and to explain @xmath17 non-@xmath20 decays , the experimental information on multipole amplitudes gains renewed interest .",
    "decay angular distributions were studied in @xmath4 by the crystal ball experiment using @xmath21  @xcite ; the contribution of the higher multipoles were not found to be significant but the errors were large due to the limited statistics . in the present analysis , @xmath22 or @xmath23 decays will be used for a similar study .",
    "the analysis on these channels has the advantage that there is no background from @xmath15 since the @xmath24 and @xmath6 processes are forbidden by parity conservation .",
    "the data used for this analysis are taken with the besii detector at the bepc storage ring operating at the @xmath1 .",
    "the number of @xmath1 events is @xmath25 million  @xcite , determined from the number of inclusive hadrons .",
    "the beijing spectrometer ( bes ) detector is a conventional solenoidal magnet detector that is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite ; besii is the upgraded version of the bes detector  @xcite . a 12-layer vertex chamber ( vc ) surrounding the beam pipe",
    "provides trigger information .",
    "a forty - layer main drift chamber ( mdc ) , located radially outside the vc , provides trajectory and energy loss ( @xmath26 ) information for charged tracks over @xmath27 of the total solid angle .",
    "the momentum resolution is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 in @xmath30 ) , and the @xmath26 resolution for hadron tracks is @xmath31 .",
    "an array of 48 scintillation counters surrounding the mdc measures the time - of - flight ( tof ) of charged tracks with a resolution of @xmath32 ps for hadrons .",
    "radially outside the tof system is a 12 radiation length , lead - gas barrel shower counter ( bsc ) .",
    "this measures the energies of electrons and photons over @xmath33 of the total solid angle with an energy resolution of @xmath34 ( @xmath35 in gev ) .",
    "outside of the solenoidal coil , which provides a 0.4  tesla magnetic field over the tracking volume , is an iron flux return that is instrumented with three double layers of counters that identify muons of momentum greater than 0.5  gev/@xmath36 .",
    "a geant3 based monte carlo ( mc ) program with detailed consideration of detector performance ( such as dead electronic channels ) is used to simulate the besii detector .",
    "the consistency between data and monte carlo has been carefully checked in many high purity physics channels , and the agreement is quite reasonable .",

    "for the decay channels of interest , there are two high momentum charged tracks and one low energy photon .",
    "the candidate events are required to satisfy the following selection criteria :    1 .",
    "at least one photon candidate is required .",
    "a neutral cluster is considered to be a photon candidate when the angle between the nearest charged track and the cluster in the @xmath50 plane is greater than @xmath51 , the first hit is in the beginning six radiation lengths of the bsc , and the angle between the cluster development direction in the bsc and the photon emission direction in the @xmath50 plane is less than @xmath52 .",
    "there is no restriction on the number of extra photons . 2 .",
    "two good charged tracks with net charge zero are required .",
    "both tracks must satisfy @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the polar angle of the track in the laboratory system .",
    "this angular region allows use of the @xmath55 counter information to eliminate @xmath56 background .",
    "3 .   to remove bhabha events , the total energy deposited in the bsc energy by the two charged tracks is required to be less than 1  gev , or @xmath57 for each track is required to be less than -3 . here",
