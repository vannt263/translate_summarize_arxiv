    "in run  ii at rhic ( @xmath0  gev ) , phenix has been able to measure particle yields up to large transverse momenta , @xmath6  gev / c , where the cross section is expected to be dominated by hard processes .",
    "this high statistics data set allows us to study the systematics of high @xmath1 phenomena in detail and at much higher @xmath1 than possible in run  i ( @xmath7  gev ) data .    in p+p collisions",
    ", it is known that hard scattering and the fragmentation of the scattered partons dominates the production of hadrons above @xmath8  gev / c  @xcite . in au+au collisions ,",
    "these hard scatterings are of particular interest because they occur early in the collision , leaving the hard - scattered partons sensitive to the properties of the collision medium . further interactions of these partons in the dense medium might cause the high transverse momentum tail of the hadron spectrum , where the hadrons are likely to be the leading particles of jets , to be suppressed  @xcite . due to the high multiplicity environment , jets can not be directly observed in a heavy ion collision .",
    "we can however determine the contribution of jet fragmentation to hadron yields at high @xmath1 via correlation measurements and use this knowledge to interpret the measured hadron @xmath1 spectra .",
    "first , we give a brief overview of the phenix detector . in the following sections ,",
    "we proceed assuming that the hadrons at high @xmath1 emanate from jets , with the objective of measuring the effect of the dense medium on the hard - scattered partons through modification of the particle spectra at high @xmath1 .",
    "we define the nuclear modification factor and show such a quantity for both neutral pions and charged hadrons . with the measurement of spectra for both charged hadrons and neutral pions , we also investigate the particle composition at high @xmath1",
    ". finally , we use two - particle correlations to test the assumption that the high @xmath1 hadrons are due to the fragmentation of hard - scattered partons .",
    "phenix is a versatile detector , with tracking chambers , ring - imaging cerenkov ( rich ) detectors , a time - of - flight ( tof ) wall , and electromagnetic calorimeters in the central arms , which cover @xmath9 and @xmath10 in azimuth . along the beamline",
    "there are beam - beam counters and zero - degree calorimeters , which are used for event triggering and centrality classification .",
    "neutral pions are measured via their @xmath11decay using the electromagnetic calorimeters ( emcal ) .",
    "there are 6 sectors of lead - scintillator ( pbsc ) and 2 sectors of lead - glass ( pbgl ) calorimeter , providing two independent measurements of the @xmath2  @xmath1 spectrum .",
    "the charged hadron spectrum is measured using the tracking detectors : drift chambers and pad chambers . at @xmath1 above @xmath12",
    "gev / c the rich detector , together with an energy cut in the pbsc , is used to identify charged pions . with various detection methods",
    ", phenix can make multiple overlapping measurements at high @xmath1 , providing valuable consistency checks .",
    "details of the detector are described elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in run  ii , phenix recorded more than 30  million minimum bias au+au events .",
    "this event sample enables us to reach 10  gev / c in the transverse momentum spectra of both identified neutral pions and charged hadrons .",
    "in addition , we recorded 140  million p+p events in which we measure neutral pions up to 13  gev / c . shown in fig .",
    "[ pi0_pp ] is the neutral pion production cross section as a function of @xmath1 , measured with the pbsc , for p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "the measured p+p spectrum is compared to a fit to ua1 data  @xcite over the range @xmath13  gev / c , extrapolated to higher @xmath1 .",
    "although our measurement agrees with the ua1 data , it disagrees with this extrapolation at very high @xmath1 .",
    "this new measurement provides an important reference spectrum for comparison with the au+au data .    for au+au collisions",
    ", the events are binned into centrality selections , and the spectra are shown for the most central bin and a peripheral bin in figs .",
    "[ chg_auau ] and  [ pi0_auau ] .",
    "centrality is expressed as a percentage of the total inelastic cross section . in the run",
    "ii data , the charged hadron yields are measured up to @xmath14  gev / c for central events and @xmath15  gev / c for peripheral events , while the neutral pion yields are measured up to 8 and 6.5  gev / c for central and peripheral events respectively .    [ chg_auau ]    [ pi0_auau ]",
    "the nuclear modification factor quantifies the effect of a+a compared to p+p collisions on particle yields for point - like processes .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the particle yield in a a+a collision to the yield in a p+p collision scaled by the mean number of binary ( nucleon+nucleon ) collisions @xmath17 in the a+a event sample . because hard processes are generally believed to scale with @xmath17 ( `` binary - scaling '' )",
    ", this ratio is expected to be one at high @xmath1 in the absence of any nuclear effects .",
    "@xmath18 shown in fig .",
    "[ raa_ecomp ] is @xmath16 as a function of @xmath1 for central pb+pb collisions at @xmath19  gev from wa98  @xcite and central au+au collisions at @xmath20  gev from phenix run  i  @xcite . already in this comparison , the suppression relative to binary - scaling at 130  gev is striking .",
    "it is quite different from the enhancement observed at 17  gev .",
    "this enhancement is known as the `` cronin effect ''  @xcite and has been attributed to @xmath1 broadening due to initial state scatterings  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ raa_periph ] shows @xmath16 for central and peripheral au+au collisions at @xmath21  gev .",
    "[ raa_ecomp ]    [ raa_periph ]    the central data again show a suppression as seen at 130  gev . with a measurement that extends to much larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the suppression is shown to persist up to @xmath22  gev / c and is as much as a factor of 5 - 6 at the largest @xmath1 .",
    "the measurement of the p+p reference spectrum with the same detector greatly reduces the systematic error in @xmath16 for central events .",
    "the @xmath16 for peripheral events is consistent with binary - scaling ( p+p yields scaled by the number of binary collisions in the peripheral event sample ) .",
    "the error in this ratio is dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath23 for peripheral collisions . within the rather large errors , the spectrum for peripheral collisions",
    "does not show effects of the nuclear medium . if there is a cronin effect at rhic , it is not strongly evident in peripheral collisions .",
    "there are a number of model predictions , shown in fig .",
    "[ raa_theory ] , that were made prior to the release of the run  ii data . in the case of one model which assumes energy loss that is constant with respect to the parton s energy  @xcite , @xmath16 increases by a factor of @xmath24 from @xmath25 to @xmath22  gev / c .",
    "although the magnitude of the suppression qualitatively describes the data at @xmath26  gev / c , the increasing @xmath16 with @xmath1 is contrary to what is observed in central au+au collisions .",
    "two other models which use a common formalism for including energy - dependent energy loss differ in the point where the calculation is begun ( thus resulting in somewhat different predictions ) .",
    "one such model predicts an @xmath16 that increases only slightly with increasing @xmath1  @xcite , while another model predicts a nearly constant @xmath16 from @xmath26 to at least @xmath6  gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the energy - dependent energy loss models give reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "this is also seen in another calculation made subsequent to the release of the run  ii data  @xcite .",
    "an alternate measure of the nuclear modification is the central - to - peripheral ratio scaled by the number of binary collisions , @xmath27 since the @xmath2 spectrum in peripheral au+au collisions is consistent with the binary - scaled p+p @xmath2 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ raa_periph ] ) , this ratio is similar to @xmath16 .",
    "an advantage of this ratio is that many of the systematic uncertainties in the measurement cancel , particularly for charged hadrons .",
    "a disadvantage is that it is sensitive to the centrality dependence of the cronin effect , which is not known .",
    "figure  [ pi0_charged ] shows this ratio as a function of @xmath1 for neutral pions , charged hadrons , and charged pions .",
    "the suppression is observed in all three measurements . in the charged hadrons , the suppression factor reaches 3 - 4 at high @xmath1 .",
    "the difference in this ratio between the identified pions and charged hadrons seems to be due to the particle composition . in particular , we find that @xmath28 in central collisions for @xmath29  gev / c while @xmath30 in peripheral collisions  @xcite .",
    "the error in the normalization , denoted by a shaded area for the charged hadrons and outlines for the neutral pions , is dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath23 for peripheral collisions .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ raa_periph ] , the 10% most central events have a suppression factor reaching 5 - 6 , while the 70 - 80% centrality selection is consistent with binary - scaled p+p collisions .",
    "we now address the evolution of the nuclear modification factor from the most peripheral to the most central collisions , in terms of the mean number of participating nucleons @xmath31 in a centrality selection . for the 10% most central collisions , @xmath32 , and for the 70 - 80% central collisions , @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ raa_cent ] shows @xmath16 vs. @xmath31 for neutral pions with @xmath34  gev / c .",
    "the suppression gradually increases from peripheral to central events .",
    "the same trend is seen in the charged hadron yields .",
    "figure  [ chg_cent ] shows the integrated yield scaled by @xmath17 vs. @xmath31 for charged hadrons .",
    "this quantity is similar to @xmath16 , differing only in normalization by the p+p reference yields .",
    "[ raa_cent ]    [ chg_cent ]    again the binary - scaled yield decreases , or the suppression increases , gradually with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "phenix can measure the @xmath35 ratio up to almost 4  gev / c in @xmath1  @xcite , at which point protons can no longer be distinguished from other particles via their time of flight .",
    "since neutral pions are identified to much higher @xmath1 , we can look at the ratio of @xmath36 to nonidentified charged hadrons @xmath37 for @xmath38  gev / c .",
    "this ratio is shown in fig .",
    "[ pi_to_h ] for minimum bias events .",
    "the surprising feature that this ratio does not increase for transverse momenta greater than 4  gev / c , but remains nearly constant at a value around 0.5 , indicates that approximately half of the charged hadrons at high @xmath1 are protons and/or kaons , assuming @xmath39 .",
    "this result is rather different from hard processes as measured in e@xmath40e@xmath41 collisions  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation for this new result is not yet clear .",
    "there may be some other production mechanism for protons and/or kaons in au+au collisions at these large transverse momenta .",
    "alternatively , the large proton and/or kaon content at high @xmath1 could be due to a difference in the suppression of pions relative to protons / kaons .",
    "since jets can not be directly observed in a au+au collisions , a correlation analysis is required to detect their presence .",
    "we take a high @xmath1 neutral particle , a cluster in the emcal with energy greater than 2.5  gev , as the trigger and correlate it with all charged particles in the event within a given range in @xmath1 . comparing the correlations that we measure in p+p collisions at @xmath0  gev to those from the pythia event generator  @xcite , we establish that pythia reproduces the behavior of jets known to be present in p+p collisions .",
    "pythia is then compared to au+au collisions at @xmath0  gev , which demonstrates that the correlations we observe in au+au collisions behave as expected for jets , both in the azimuthal and polar angles .",
    "figure  [ auau_dphi ] shows the background - subtracted correlation in the azimuthal angle @xmath42 of the trigger particle with charged particles having @xmath1 between 2 and 4  gev / c .",
    "[ auau_dphi ]    also shown is a fit to the data of the correlation produced by pythia with an added @xmath43 term .",
    "the @xmath43 term accounts for the contribution of flow to the correlation , while the coefficient of the pythia term represents the contribution due to jets .",
    "further details of this analysis are given elsewhere  @xcite . from the figure",
    ", one can see that much of the correlation can be attributed to jets ( pythia ) , particularly the near - side correlation around @xmath44 .",
    "the trigger particle is typically a photon from a @xmath2 decay .",
    "this is strong evidence that when we trigger on a high @xmath1  @xmath2 , we are indeed looking at a leading particle from a jet .",
    "we have presented @xmath1 spectra for charged hadrons in au+au collisions and neutral pions in au+au and p+p collisions and have shown that the high @xmath1 suppression observed in run  i  rhic data at @xmath7  gev  @xcite persists up to @xmath22  gev / c at @xmath0  gev .",
    "the neutral pions are suppressed by a factor of 5 - 6 and the charged hadrons by 3 - 4 for @xmath38  gev / c in the most central collisions .",
    "the suppression increases gradually with increasing centrality , or @xmath31 .",
    "we have also shown that when triggering on a high @xmath1 neutral particle , which is predominantly a photon from a @xmath2 decay , the correlation between the neutral and charged particles in the event is jet - like .",
    "this is strong evidence that the neutral pions that we measure at high @xmath1 indeed have significant contributions from jet fragmentation .",
    "finally , we have shown that approximately half of the charged hadrons at high @xmath1 are not pions , but protons and/or kaons , up to @xmath45  gev / c",
