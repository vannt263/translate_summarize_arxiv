    "the cosmic gamma - ray background ( cgb ) between @xmath7 kev and @xmath7 gev has been measured by several gamma - ray satellites ( heao , smm , comptel and egret ) @xcite .",

    "reproduces both the amplitude and the slope of the data @xcite . in the intermediate energy range ,",
    "however , another type of sources is needed , since blazar spectra show a clear break near 10 mev and the cosmological gamma - ray background from seyfert galaxies falls off above about 100 kev ( see fig .",
    "[ contrib ] ) .",
    "as discussed by several authors @xcite , type ia supernovae could make a significant contribution in this energy range , which we shall evaluate in section 2 .",

    "furthermore , the recent observation , by the integral satellite , of a 511 kev diffuse emission line from the galactic bulge@xcite shows that electron - positron annihilation are taking place there with a very large rate @xmath8 s@xmath6 .",
    "such a high rate is difficult , if not impossible , to impute to astrophysical objects , and the source of these positrons in the bulge is subject to intense debate .",
    "this emission from the bulge of the milky way could be the signature of light dark matter particles annihilating into @xmath9   @xcite , the positrons eventually annihilating with electrons encountered in the interstellar medium  @xcite . in any case",
    ", if one extrapolates this diffuse emission to all other galaxies in the universe , the integrated flux could make a significant additional contribution to the hard @xmath3-ray and soft gamma - ray background .",
    "since the potential implications of such an hypothesis for particle physics and cosmology are very important , we want to test here its validity or at least its consistency , as far as the cosmological gamma - ray background is concerned . using a recent model of galaxy formation  @xcite ,",
    "we compute self - consistently the gamma - ray background coming from both type - ia supernovae ( adding seyfert - galaxies and blazars ) , and annihilating positrons from light dark matter halos .",
    "we follow in this respect the earlier work of ahn & komatsu  @xcite , who were the first to compute this background , assuming , like them , however , that positrons annihilate `` on the spot '' in all dark matter halos in the universe .",
    "these authors explored various scenarios for the internal structure of dark matter halos and analyzed how these various models affect the amplitude of the gamma - ray background .",
    "in the present paper , we would like to go one step further , and explicitly take into account the role of baryons in the process of positron confinement and annihilation .",
    "this process is indeed possible only if the parent halo contains enough baryons ( and therefore also electrons ) to host a dense , magnetized , interstellar medium .",
    "this is a necessary condition for the `` on the spot '' approximation to be valid . since low mass halos are unable to host enough baryons in a cold and magnetized disc  @xcite , the escaping positron mean free path increases dramatically .",
    "to compute the positron escape fraction and their propagation in the expanding background , a complex diffusion study would be necessary .",
    "as a first order approximation we shall assume that the positron escape fraction goes from zero to one below the critical mass for a dark matter halo to host a galaxy , as computed in  @xcite , and that these escaping positrons never annihilate .    the outline of this article is as follows . in section 2 , we estimate the contribution of snia to the gamma - ray background , adding it to that of seyfert galaxies and blazars ( at lower and higher energies , respectively ) . the difference with the observed spectrum provides an upper limit on any additional contribution such as the one due to annihilating positrons , that could come from light dark matter particle annihilation . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the diffuse cosmological background induced by all dark matter halos in the universe , taking into account that positrons can not annihilate in small mass halos , and compare it to the previous calculation performed by ahn & komatsu  @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we present the gamma - ray background constraints on the annihilation cross - sections and the masses of light dark matter candidates .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions in section 5 . in an appendix",
    ", we estimate for calibration purpose , and confront with spi / integral observations , the 511 kev emission from the galactic bulge .",
    "we consider various annihilation cross - sections ( depending on whether they are @xmath0- or @xmath1- wave dominated ) and the corresponding halo dark matter density profiles .",
    "the type ia supernovae contribution to the gamma - ray background depends primarily on the star formation history in the universe , which , in this paper , is derived from a new self - consistent model of galaxy formation  @xcite .",
    "this analytical model predicts the cosmological evolution of the four main baryon phases in the universe : diffuse intergalactic gas , hot gas , cold gas in galaxies and stars .",
    "these theoretical predictions were validated with high - resolution cosmological simulations using the ramses @xcite and gadget codes @xcite .",
    "they also reproduce the observed amount of cold gas in the damped lyman - alpha systems @xcite and the observed cosmic star formation rate @xcite ( see fig .  [ snr ] ) , which is of prime interest here .",
    "the model particularly emphasizes the important cosmological role of the minimal mass for a halo to host galaxies , @xmath10 .",
    "we shall use it to , first , compute the snia gamma - ray background , and , also , to evaluate the new background that could be attributed to the annihilation of positrons , possibly generated in annihilating dark matter halos .",

[ contrib ] .",
    "it shows a bump in the range 300 kev up to 3 mev , at a level which turns out to be close to the predicted contributions from seyfert galaxies and blazars .",

    "altogether the resulting evaluation from known astrophysical sources reproduces reasonably well the observed extragalactic background below @xmath31  kev and above @xmath32  mev .",

    "the behaviour of the concentration parameter for smaller halo masses , unresolved by numerical simulation , is totally unknown .    the slope at the center of dark matter halos is thought to be between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "a rather large annihilation cross - section could lead to an excessive continuum of gamma - ray photons at various energies ( depending on @xmath79 ) .",
    "cross - sections which behave , at least to a large extent , proportionally to @xmath86 ( @xmath1-wave annihilation ) , may therefore be preferred  @xcite , especially at lower @xmath87 .",
    "the residual annihilation of dark matter particles in bulges of spiral galaxies or in ellipticals would then include a suppression factor that could be , in the pure @xmath1-wave case , as strong as @xmath88 .",

    "this trapping can be achieved only if both the density of the interstellar medium and the galactic magnetic field are sufficient .",

    "note that , while the `` on the spot '' approximation , used by ahn & komatsu  @xcite for the whole mass range , leads , in our opinion , to an overestimation of the diffuse background , our approach , though more accurate , should lead to an underestimation of the background level .",

    ", our computation of the gamma - ray background leads to a result about 10 times smaller than the one evaluated by @xcite .",

    "hypernovae  @xcite and the related gamma - ray bursts  @xcite are in a better position , but since the number of massive stars is about ten times larger in the disk than in the bulge , hot spots of 511 kev emission should show up in the disk plane , which is not the case .",
    "low mass x - ray binaries have also been suggested  @xcite , but no 511 kev emission has been observed from these objects .",

    "we assume that essentially no annihilation can take place outside the stellar bulge , due to a lack of gas ( corresponding roughly to an angle @xmath116 ) .",
    "the resulting profiles are convolved with the integral / spi point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "this method allows a fair comparison between observations and models , and depends only weakly of the poorly known size of the gaseous bulge .",

    "having estimated the snia contribution in the 100 kev-10 mev energy range , we have found that an unexplained gamma - ray background emission at most of the order of 4 kev @xmath35 s@xmath6 sr@xmath6 remains . as proposed in @xcite , the strong 511 kev emission from the galactic center detected by the integral satellite",
    "could be explained by light dark matter annihilation , and we have verified that the observed emission profile can be reproduced , both for @xmath0 and @xmath1-wave annihilation cross - sections . using the hierarchical model of structure formation , we have computed the corresponding gamma - ray background , and found it to be compatible with current observational bounds , _ if one takes into account the minimal halo mass for galaxy formation_. the new positron - generated ( dark matter - induced ) extragalactic background is in fact overwhelmed by other emissions from snia , seyferts , and blazars .",
    "the exclusion of small mass halos as ( redshifted ) 511 kev photon sources leads to an order of magnitude decrease of the extragalactic flux around 500 kev as compared to earlier studies .",
    "the spectral shape of the extragalactic background is also modified in the sense that the number of dark matter halos capable of hosting gas rich galaxies decrease very strongly with increasing redshift .    _",

    "the computation of the milky - way emission profile @xmath135 is not the main goal of this paper , since we only used the integrated emission ( and not the shape ) for calibration purposes .",
    "however , it is essential to compare carefully predicted profiles to the observed one ( see the recent paper @xcite ) . in this appendix",
    ", we would like to outline some interesting issues concerning this point . using the same hypothesis as in section 2 , we consider the three different cases of table [ tablecalib ] : a nfw profile with @xmath136 and a @xmath0-wave cross - section ; a nfw profile with @xmath110 and a @xmath1-wave cross - section ; and finally , a moore profile with @xmath136 and a @xmath1-wave cross - section .",
    "-wave annihilation cross - section with a nfw dark matter profile ( continuous line ) ; or @xmath1-wave cross - section with a nfw ( dashed line ) or moore ( dotted line ) profile , as specified in the text . the figure does not show the actual 511 kev emission profiles , but the results of their _ convolution with the spectrometer s response _ , the point spread function ( psf )  which is a crude but more rigourous way in order to compare data with models . the lower dot - dashed line shows the rate ( not compatible with the data ) that would correspond to a pointlike source . for the calibration , we choose the dark matter particle mass so that the observed integral of the signal over the inner 16 degrees is equal to the one from the theoretical profile . ]    in the pure @xmath0-wave case with an essentially constant , we have chosen to consider and test , with the above nfw distribution , a dark matter particle with mass @xmath137 mev@xmath138 .",
    "let us note however that , given our hypothesis , the same emission profile would have been obtained from the same @xmath139 but with a mass of @xmath140 ( or 1.1 ) mev@xmath138 only , and an @xmath125 term that would be @xmath141 ( or 10@xmath142 ) times smaller .",
    "the corresponding ( @xmath143-wave ) cross - section would then be _",
    "@xmath1-wave dominated at freeze - out _ , while appearing as _ @xmath0-wave - dominated _ for low - velocity annihilation _ in the galactic center_.    in the pure @xmath1-wave case on the other hand , for which the annihilation cross - section in the galactic center should be lower ( i.e. typically @xmath144 @xmath84 s@xmath6 ) , @xmath79 should in general be taken relatively small , to get ( with a correct relic density ) a sufficiently intense gamma - ray line . in practice",
    "we test @xmath79 about 0.5 ( with the nfw profile ) and 1.2 mev@xmath138 ( with the moore profile ) .    at first sight ,",
    "all three tested profiles seem compatible with the observations , within the precision of the analysis . attempting to discriminate between them ( or with analogous ones )",
    "would require a careful chi - squared analysis and is beyond the scope of this article , as we are mainly interested here in the total observed intensity and global morphology of the 511 kev emission of the galactic bulge .",
    "if the cross - section for dark matter annihilation in halos is velocity - independent ( @xmath0-wave or effectively @xmath0-wave annihilation ) , the emissivity of a nfw dark matter halo scales near the center as @xmath145 . convolving this emission with the spi point spread function ( psf )",
    ", we obtain the profile presented as a continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fluxmwtot ] .",
    "we emphasize here that the profiles shown are the profiles after convolution by the psf .",
    "if , however , this cross - section is @xmath0-wave suppressed , the emissivity now depends on the dark matter 3d velocity dispersion  @xcite .",
    "we then compute @xmath98 as a function of the radius by solving the jeans equation , at first for a nfw potential . the resulting emission profile ( shown after convolution as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fluxmwtot ] ) also turns out to fit the data , although it is _ less peaked _ , as the velocities increase with @xmath146 , within the region of interest .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned earlier , to get in this case the appropriate intensity for the 511 kev line we need to consider both rather small values of @xmath79 ( about @xmath147 mev@xmath138 ) and somewhat extreme parameters for the milky -way dark matter halo ( choosing @xmath148 ) .    these restrictions may be avoided to some extent , however , with a _ steeper profile _ such as the moore profile  @xcite , which enhances the rate of dark matter annihilation , especially near the center of the galaxy , so that the resulting emission profile ( shown after convolution as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fluxmwtot ] ) gets now _",
    "more peaked_. with such profiles , @xmath1-wave annihilation with standard milky - way parameters appear to be compatible with the data , even for less small values of @xmath87 .",
    "furthermore , note that _ if dark matter is subject to the stellar gravitational potential that dominates the central region of the galaxy _",
    "@xcite , with a radial density profile declining roughly as @xmath149  @xcite , the @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave cases would be essentially indistinguishable .    to conclude this appendix ,",
    "we have verified that one can reproduce the photon flux and distribution observed by integral , both for @xmath0- and @xmath1 wave cross - sections , with standard dark matter profiles @xmath94 and appropriate mass @xmath79 .",
    "again , in this approach , attempting to further discriminate between emission profiles associated with @xmath0- or @xmath1-wave annihilation appears as difficult , given the width of the psf function and the variety of the dark matter profiles , gravitational potential profiles and gas density profiles which may be considered ."
