    "in the last thirty years , @xmath2-process studies have been mainly pursued either by nucleosynthesis computations in stellar models for the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) phases of low and intermediate mass stars @xcite or by a phenomenological model , the so - called _ classical approach _ , developed with the intention to provide a possibility for a `` model - free '' description ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .    until recently ,",
    "the two descriptions remained compatible within their respective uncertainties , while the @xmath3c(@xmath4,n)@xmath5o  neutron source was recognized to play a major role on the agb , and was assumed to occur in convective thermal pulses @xcite . under such conditions , the classical analysis was considered suitable to extract `` effective '' conditions characterizing the stellar scenarios .",
    "this situation changed drastically , when it was realized that @xmath3c burns radiatively in the time interval between two successive he - shell instabilities @xcite .",
    "the interplay of the different thermal conditions for the @xmath3c and @xmath6ne neutron sources became so complex as to be hardly represented by a single set of effective parameters , as commonly used by the classical approach ( essentially neutron density @xmath7 , temperature _ t _ , mean neutron exposure @xmath8 ) .",
    "this is particularly true for the mathematical treatment of the neutron irradiation , usually simplified through an exponential distribution of exposures in phenomenological studies , @xmath9(@xmath10 ) @xmath11 exp(@xmath12/@xmath8 ) .",
    "stellar models now show that this distribution is definitely non - exponential .",
    "any attempt to maintain the classical picture would require a larger number of free parameters , in contradiction with the basic reason for this approach as a model - independent guideline for stellar calculations . in view of these conceptual differences , it is not surprising that the results of the classical analysis and of agb models exhibit significant discrepancies .",
    "a region of the @xmath2-process path where this is particularly evident , involves the neutron - magic nuclei at @xmath0 82 , including the s - only isotope @xmath1nd .",
    "the small cross sections of these nuclei act as bottle necks for the reaction flow and are , therefore , sensitive to the characteristics of the neutron exposure .",
    "the @xmath2-process abundance of @xmath1nd is influenced by small branchings in the neutron capture path at @xmath13ce and @xmath1pr ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the expected branching factor for bypassing @xmath1nd is about 5% . while a meaningful analysis was long hampered by the uncertainties in the nuclear physics data , especially for @xmath1nd  , accurate measurements of the stellar ( n,@xmath14 ) cross sections of @xmath15ce @xcite , @xmath13pr @xcite , and of all stable nd isotopes @xcite have been reported recently , along with new calculations of the cross sections of the unstable branch point nuclei @xmath13ce and @xmath1pr @xcite .",
    "significant discrepancies were found with the previously adopted cross sections , thus requiring an updated analysis .",
    "@xmath1nd  is located immediately at the pronounced precipice of the @xmath16@xmath17 curve , which is caused by the small ( n,@xmath14 ) cross sections at @xmath0 82 .",
    "hence , its cross section determines not only the branching analysis , but also the general shape of the @xmath2-process distribution . since the @xmath18-decay rates of @xmath13ce and @xmath1pr are almost independent of the stellar temperature @xcite , the branchings are completely defined , according to the classical model , by the effective @xmath2-process neutron density , @xmath7 , which is best obtained from the neighboring branchings bypassing @xmath19sm : @xmath20 @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this value together with a thermal energy of @xmath22 30 kev and an electron density of @xmath23 5.4 @xmath24 10@xmath25 @xmath21 has been used for an @xmath2-process analysis with an updated reaction network .",
    "the best fit to the solar system distribution for the @xmath2-nuclei belonging to the main component is obtained for a mean neutron exposure @xmath26(0.296@xmath270.003 ) [ @xmath28/30]@xmath29 mbarn@xmath30 .",
    "the left panel of fig . 2 provides evidence for a significant overproduction of @xmath1nd with respect to the reference isotope @xmath31sm , despite part of the reaction flow bypasses this isotope .",
    "the overproduction exceeds by far the uncertainties of the cross section ( 2% at 30 kev ) and of the solar abundance , the abundance ratio between the chemically related rare earth elements nd and sm being known to 1.8% @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the overproduction may be even larger in case of a non - neglibible @xmath32-process contribution .",
    "therefore , @xmath1nd provides the first significant hint that the simple assumptions of the classical approach are not adequate to describe the @xmath2-process near magic neutron numbers .",
    "failures of the classical model have been found previously for the @xmath2-only nuclei @xmath33sn and @xmath34ba @xcite , but these discrepancies were masked by the large uncertainties of the solar sn and ba abundances .    a description of the stellar model and the adopted reaction network can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "updated @xmath2-process calculations have been made using stellar evolutionary computations with the franec code @xcite for low mass stars , from the main sequence up to end of the agb phase .",
    "a relatively large range of masses ( 1.5 @xmath35 @xmath36 3 ) and metallicities ( -0.4 @xmath35 [ fe / h ] @xmath35 0 ) have been examined as well as the influence of various mass - loss rates .",
    "the best reproduction of the solar distribution of the main @xmath2-component was obtained for a 2 @xmath37 star with @xmath38 @xmath39 , and a mass loss rate according to reimers with @xmath40 .    the general improvement with respect to the classical solution ( fig .",
    "2 ) , is striking , especially since no fitting procedure was applied .",
    "@xmath34ba are now overproduced by only 5% , a value compatible with the uncertainties of the neutron capture cross sections and solar abundances , thus avoiding the 20% correction of the solar barium abundance suggested by the classical analysis @xcite . similarly , also @xmath33sn , that had required a 15% correction of the solar tin abundance @xcite , is now reproduced within uncertainties . as for @xmath1nd ,",
    "the new cross section improves the situation drastically , resulting in very good agreement with the solar abundance .",
    "the previously overestimated @xmath1nd cross section had always led to a persisting 30% deficiency of the @xmath1nd abundance , incompatible with the expected @xmath32-process contribution of only a few percent @xcite .",
    "actually , to reproduce the @xmath2-isotopes in the solar system requires a more complex analysis including the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "also in this context , the updated ( n,@xmath14 ) cross sections yield a satisfactory description of the solar @xmath1nd abundance @xcite .",
    "the @xmath41-process residuals @xmath42 in fig .",
    "3 were calculated with the @xmath2-abundance average from the models for 1.5 and 3 @xmath37 stars , which represents a good approximation of the distribution obtained with a chemical evolution study .",
    "compared to the @xmath41 residuals derived from the classical @xmath2 abundances the plot of fig .",
    "3 shows only minor differences .",
    "however , it should be noted that the stellar models yield a 20% @xmath41-process component of the solar barium abundance , in excellent agreement with recent observations in low metallicity stars @xcite .",
