    "many recent areas at the forefront of fundamental physics access new realms of dynamics through non - local mechanisms .",
    "such exotic frameworks often drive interesting phenomena in research areas such as string theory , quantum gravity , the quantum hall effect , and more recently quantum cosmology .",
    "the applications span a myriad of counter - intuitive features , from non - commutativity of geometry to multi - valued dispersion relations .",
    "yet they share a handful of common properties that seem to be at the foundation of non - locality , such as fuzzy size for excitations that increases with momentum  @xcite , faster than light signal propagation  @xcite , and a mechanism akin to the landau levels problem  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on a recent effort known as puff field theory ( pft )  @xcite that realizes non - local dynamics within a computationally accessible and unitary setting of string theory .",
    "the particular details of the consistent truncation of the full string theory that leads to the pft sets the theory apart from other similar attempts such as non - commutative yang - mills ( ncsym ) , non - commutative open strings ( ncos ) , and dipole theories  @xcite .",
    "regardless , the general strategy in all these cases is the same : one takes inherently non - local degrees of freedom in string theory such as d - branes , turns on a background flux to polarize the partons or twists the geometry , and identifies a low energy limit that decouples the theory from gravity yet leaving it with the non - local character of the parent string theory . in the case of the pft , one focuses on d3 branes in a melvin universe with an rr 5-form background flux .",
    "the resulting decoupled theory exhibits non - locality with varied amounts of supersymmetry and r - symmetry . for the pft of interest in this paper",
    ", we deal with a @xmath0 dimensional pft with @xmath1 supersymmetry and @xmath2 r - symmetry .",
    "a hallmark of the phenomenon of non - locality in string theory is a mixing of high and low energy dynamics . for energies low enough compared to the scale of non - locality ,",
    "the size of an excitation in the theory is characterized by its compton wavelength ; however , at higher energies one finds that larger energies correspond to bigger physical sizes for the excitations . for most ncsym , ncos , or dipole theories",
    ", this fuzzing of the excitations occurs in a subset of the physical dimensions of the theory and breaks lorentz symmetry in a manner that is phenomenologically undesirable . in our pft ,",
    "the excitations expand in all three space directions , breaking lorentz symmetry only to @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , a lagrangian formulation of the pft is still missing",
    ". however , a strong coupling computational framework exists through gravitational holography  @xcite .",
    "hence , we focus on the strongly coupled regime of the pft and attempt to unravel the non - local aspects of its dynamics",
    ". the iib gravitational dual of the pft may be split into two five dimensional parts @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; with the pft living in a four dimensional subspace of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 being a five dimensional compact manifold with varying size as one moves in the @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the coupling in the theory by @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the length scale of non - locality .",
    "non - local aspects of the theory are expected to arise for operators that carry r - charge .",
    "hence , we employ probes in the dual bulk spacetime with the associated momenta . these consist of excitations arising from kaluza - klein modes on the @xmath5 .",
    "we find that we can approximate the analysis through the use of geodesics , while still having back - reaction effects and the optical limit under control .    and through the use of null and spacelike geodesics , we explore uv - ir mixing and equal - time correlators in the pft .",
    "our analysis leads to a sequence of novel and surprising observations that set the pft apart from other non - local theories and renders it even more compelling .",
    "the results may be summarized as follows :    * we find that the bulk space has an apparent horizon that divides it into two regions and where the rate of expansion of null geodesics vanishes .",
    "bousso s criterion  @xcite for holography suggests that the two regions are holographically encoded onto the same holographic screen .",
    "other works  @xcite suggest that such screens can also play the role of entangling the quantum theories on either side . in this setting , we find that one has a quantum entanglement of uv and ir dynamics .",
    "* we propose a new holographic prescription for mapping observables in this bulk space to observables in the pft .",
    "this involves separating the notion of integrating out high energy modes from that of integrating out high momentum modes .",
    "thus we are left with two different realizations of renormalization group flow , with the uv completion of the pft sitting at the apparent horizon .",
    "* we compute equal - time correlators for various observables , reproducing the expected low energy or low momentum results while adding new physics at high energies or high momenta .",
    "the correlators smoothly interpolate between power law and exponential behavior as one moves from low to high energies . *",
    "we find that the pft exhibits non - locality at an energy scale @xmath8 at strong coupling .",
    "hence , the effects of non - locality are enhanced .",
    "* we develop a new relation between momentum and spatial support size in the pft that associates a single momentum scale with two sizes , and vice versa .",
    "* we compute a c - function for the pft using null geodesics in the bulk .",
    "we find that the pft behaves very differently from ncsym and ncos theories , exhibiting a divergence in the c - function at the apparent horizon and violating the monotonicity condition in the uv .",
    "we confirm that the latter arises from a violation of the null energy condition in the bulk in certain regions .",
    "* bringing together all these observations , we apply these results to a toy cosmological scenario .",
    "we assume that at some early time in the history of the universe , the primordial plasma was described by a theory similar to strongly coupled pft . hence , equal - time correlators in the pft determine the initial conditions of fluctuations of the plasma , which then evolves through inflation and leads to structure formation .",
    "we compute the power spectrum that results from such a scenario and find that signature of stringy physics can indeed arise at small length scales in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "this is due to a combination of an enhancement of non - local effects at strong coupling and the stretching of small scale structure though the violent expansion of space .    the outline of the paper goes as follows .",
    "we start in section 2 with setting up the gravitational background that is holographically dual to strongly coupled pft .",
    "we determine the various conditions on the parameters that assure that the computation is reliable . in section 3 ,",
    "we first look at the expansion / contraction rate of null geodesics in the bulk identifying an apparent horizon and entanglement screen .",
    "we then proceed to developing the uv - ir relations that relate energy / momentum scale in the pft to extent in the bulk . in the last subsection",
    ", we present the prescription that allows the computation of correlators in the pft using geodesics of the bulk space .",
    "we also present a mechanism for entangling ` high and low energy operators ' so as to naturally reproduce these observables . in section 4 ,",
    "we present analytical asymptotics and numerical plots of various equal - time correlators .",
    "section 5 discusses a cosmology application of the results .",
    "this includes embedding the setup into the so - called minimal approach of structure formation ; one then uses the correlators from the pft to compute the power spectrum of scalar fluctuations .",
    "the appendices describe a computation of the c - functions for the pft , ncsym , and ncos theories , contrasting the results , as well as the development of a non - local realization of fourier transforms , relating momentum to length scale in the pft .",
    "pft may be thought of as the @xmath0 dimensional worldvolume theory for @xmath9 d3 branes in a melvin universe supported by a background 5-form rr flux  @xcite .",
    "the theory is parameterized by the number of d3 branes @xmath9 , a coupling constant @xmath10 , and a scale of non - locality @xmath7 which has dimensions of length . in  @xcite ,",
    "the theory is also compactified on a 3-torus .",
    "one can realize different versions of pft with a varying number of supersymmetries . for our purposes",
    ", we will only consider the decompactified theory with @xmath1 supersymmetry in @xmath0 dimensions . at low energies",
    ", this pft is expected to flow to @xmath11 super yang - mills ( sym ) .",
    "the pft of interest has full @xmath3 symmetry while being a non - local theory .",
    "the r - symmetry is broken down from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "excitations with large momenta and with r - charge are expected to fuzz out in all three space directions to a volume proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "while a full lagrangian description of pft is still missing , we will only be concerned with the strong coupling regime of the theory ; the latter is accessible through holography by studying supergravity excitations in a particular curved background .",

    "the angles @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath20 parameterize an @xmath25 which may be viewed as a hopf fibration with @xmath24 labeling the fiber direction and the base @xmath26 described by @xmath27 .",
    "the two functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 appearing in the metric are given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the iib string coupling , @xmath9 is the number of d3 branes , and @xmath7 is the scale of non - locality .",
    "the dilaton profile is constant @xmath32 but there is a non - trivial 5-form rr flux that supports the geometry .",
    "the latter is of no relevance to our discussion as we will concentrate on supergravity probes with zero rr charge .",
    "furthermore , we focus on the five dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath33 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 by considering processes involving no angular dynamics @xmath34 with @xmath35 for convenience ( note that this point is a coordinate singularity of  ( [ eq : thebigmetric ] ) ) .",
    "timelike or null geodesics confined to this cross - section of the space carry momentum in the @xmath24 and @xmath20 directions because of the twist in the geometry , as seen through the @xmath36 and @xmath37 cross - terms of the metric .",
    "these are seen by the pft as probes with r - charge .",
    "for example , taking @xmath38 for simplicity , @xmath39 is a killing vector and geodesics stationary in the angle directions still carry momentum in the @xmath24 direction given by @xmath40 which scales as @xmath14 for small @xmath7 . more importantly ,",
    "kaluza - klein modes in the @xmath24 direction generate supergravity modes of mass @xmath41 we shall see that these masses are parametrically small in string units .",
    "probes associated with these excitations would then carry r - charge as well .",
    "consider a coordinate transformation @xmath42 and a rescaling of all five coordinates @xmath43 where @xmath44 we will later need to take @xmath45 , with @xmath10 being the effective coupling in the pft .",

    "the metric becomes @xmath46 \\ .\\ ] ] note that this metric includes the @xmath47 term from the twisted part of the metric .",
    "the holographic direction is @xmath48 , and there is a throat in the geometry at @xmath49 as shown in figure  [ fig : curvatureplot ] .    .",
    "the throat referred to in the text appears at @xmath50.,width=576 ]    the einstein frame metric has the overall factor @xmath51 replaced by @xmath52 : @xmath53 note also that the decoupling limit involves taking @xmath54 while @xmath10 , @xmath48 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 are held fixed .",
    "we want to probe this geometry with geodesics , using them to compute correlation functions in the pft at strong coupling @xmath6 .",
    "hence , we need to assure that the supergravity description and the optical approximation are valid . for small curvatures compared to the string scale ,",
    "this leads to @xmath57 we also need to make sure that the circle along @xmath24 is not too small compared to the string scale @xmath58 otherwise , we would need to consider the t - dual geometry .",
    "note that this condition also renders kaluza - klein modes associated with this circle light .",
    "we also require weak string coupling @xmath59 using  ( [ eq : smallcurvatures ] ) , this also implies that one needs @xmath45 . finally , the optical approximation implied by a geodesic treatment is valid when the wavelength of the bulk probe is much smaller than the local curvature of the space it is moving through @xmath60 where the momentum of a geodesic probe is to be measured locally as well .",
    "the local curvature can be measured through the ricci scalar @xmath61 measured in terms of the coordinate variable @xmath62 , this length scale is @xmath63 the momentum canonically conjugate to the @xmath64 coordinate for a spacelike geodesic probe of interest is given by @xmath65 .",
    "we will see later ( through equations  ( [ eq : puffmomcons ] ) , ( [ eq : prescaling ] ) and  ( [ eq : pmax ] ) ) that this momentum scale is bounded as in @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the rest mass of the probe .",
    "the curvature length scale @xmath68 given by  ( [ eq : curvaturescale ] ) is bounded from below ( with a single minimum at @xmath69 where @xmath70 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : optical ] ) then leads to @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a small numerical scale tuning the momentum in units of the maximum momentum @xmath73 the important point is in the presence of the @xmath51 factor .",
    "we see that one can extend the geodesic treatment to probes of mass scale @xmath74 and @xmath72 parametrically small as long as we have @xmath6 .",
    "basically , since the curvature is bounded , we can always push curvature length scales _ for all _ @xmath48 to large enough values to extend the optical approximation to a larger parameter space in @xmath75 and @xmath72 .",
    "this is needed because we want to access small momenta , and we also need to keep back - reaction effects under control @xmath76 for example , one can achieve this by considering a low lying kaluza - klein mode of the @xmath24 circle , which is large in string units as required by the t - duality condition  ( [ eq : tduality ] ) .",
    "this also implies that such a probe will necessarily carry r - charge under the @xmath13 r - symmetry of the pft .    for the rest of the paper , we focus on the regime delineated by  ( [ eq : smallcurvatures ] ) , ( [ eq : tduality ] ) , ( [ eq : weakstringcoupling ] ) , ( [ eq : opticalapprox ] ) , and  ( [ eq : smallmass ] ) .",
    "together , these require very large @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and avoiding the use of geodesics of very small momenta that probe regions of small @xmath48 .",
    "we start by focusing on a congruence of null geodesics spanning the @xmath55-@xmath48 subspace of the geometry .",
    "@xmath77 being a killing vector , we have the conservation law @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant .",
    "we then write the tangent to future directed null geodesics in the @xmath55-@xmath48 plane as @xmath80 the second fundamental form is @xmath81 whose trace @xmath82 measures the rate of expansion / contraction of the geodesics @xmath83 where the upper plus sign corresponds to future directed geodesics moving towards increasing @xmath48 while the lower minus sign corresponds to future directed geodesics towards decreasing @xmath48 .",
    "we then conclude that @xmath84 the asymptotics of  ( [ eq : thetheta ] ) are @xmath85 and figure  [ fig : pufftheta ] shows a plot .     of future - directed null geodesics",
    "projected away from @xmath86 surface.,width=576 ]    the @xmath87 surface is then an _ apparent horizon _ of the geometry .",
    "note that when @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , this feature of the geometry disappears as @xmath90 .",
    "bousso s criterion  @xcite for holography would then suggest that there exists a holographic screen at @xmath91 encoding entropy and information from two regions on either side of the screen .",
    "this constitutes a novel realm of holography in string theory . a related setting",
    "was recently explored in  @xcite ( from other work on holographic entanglement , see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of these works considered the computation of entanglement entropy of a conformal field theory by tracing over states lying outside a region interest . in the holographic dual of this process",
    ", they suggested to slice the bulk with a screen where the congruence of null geodesics vanishes - with the boundaries of this screen matching onto the boundaries of the region of interest in the dual theory ( see figure  [ fig : entanglement ] ) .",
    "entanglement screen separates the bulk into two regions a and b , and the boundary into two regions @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is proposed that the entanglement entropy of region a or b is given by the area of entanglement screen.,width=576 ]    the suggestion is that the surface where @xmath82 vanishes divides two bulk regions that map onto a pair of entangled density of states . for the pft ,",
    "the presence of an apparent horizon is suggestive that an entanglement mechanism may be at work as well . in the appendices ,",
    "we demonstrate that this phenomenon is absent from ncsym and ncos theories . in the next subsection ,",
    "we explore uv - ir relations to help us unravel this intricate phenomenon apparently particular to the pft .      to determine the relation between energy scale in the pft and the holographic coordinate @xmath48",
    ", we could look at the finite temperature version of our geometry .",
    "one then easily finds that temperature in the pft scales as  @xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the location of the horizon in the corresponding geometry .",
    "the surface gravity and hence the temperature are not affected by the cross terms @xmath96 and @xmath97 of the metric , hence the simple form of  ( [ eq : temperature ] ) .",
    "we will henceforth refer to the @xmath98 region as the uv domain , and the @xmath99 as the ir domain .",
    "this simple uv - ir relation however masks the rich non - local substructure of the theory . to better understand the problem , consider spacelike geodesics in the @xmath100 subspace . using the @xmath3 symmetry",
    ", we can always align such a geodesic within a chosen two dimensional plane , which we parameterize for simplicity by @xmath101 .",
    "the killing vector @xmath102 leads to the conservation statement @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant related to momentum . and the geodesic being spacelike",

    "geodesics then oscillate between the two critical points for fixed momentum @xmath112 as shown in figure  [ fig : geodesicplot ] .     in the @xmath106 plane .",
    "the length of the segment labeled ( a ) is denoted in the text by @xmath113 ; the length of the segment ( b ) is denoted by @xmath114.,width=576 ]    equation  ( [ eq : puffmomxi ] ) implies a maximum value for the momentum @xmath112 , which arises in the limit of @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117 as can be seen in figure  [ fig : critpoints ] .    ) relating the turn - around critical point @xmath118 to momentum @xmath112.,width=576 ]    consider the pft with a uv cutoff @xmath119 as shown in figures  [ fig : geodesicplot ] and  [ fig : critpoints ] . if we take @xmath120 as a holographic screen , we have @xmath121 for a congruence of null geodesics _ projected from @xmath122 _ only for @xmath123 .",
    "hence , it is the upper segment that is a candidate for holographic encoding - for example through the representative geodesic labeled ( a ) in the figures . the maximum momentum that may be probed at this uv cutoff is given by @xmath124 .",
    "in this regime , as we increase the uv cutoff @xmath125 and hence decrease @xmath122 , we may probe the pft at large momenta @xmath126 .",
    "this synchs well with our intuition from local field theories .",
    "however , if the uv cutoff is chosen in the uv region at say @xmath127 ( as shown in figure  [ fig : critpoints ] ) , we now have @xmath121 for null geodesics projected from @xmath128 for the _ lower _ segment @xmath129 instead ; and we still have a maximal momentum @xmath130 .",
    "the region available for holographic encoding is given by @xmath129 and may be probed by the representative geodesic labeled ( b ) in the figure .",
    "however , higher uv cutoffs @xmath125 correspond to smaller momenta @xmath131 ! this can only make sense in the renormalization group spirit if we divorce the concept of integrating out high energy modes from that of integrating out high momentum modes .",
    "the discussion leads us to the following modified picture for renormalization group in this non - local theory .",
    "if one wants to probe the pft up to a certain momentum @xmath132 , this picks two corresponding values in the bulk for holographic screens , say at @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "we are then to integrate out physics in the bulk lying in the region @xmath135 .    on the other hand",
    ", we may also be interested in probing the theory after integrating out high energy modes instead of large momentum scales . in the pft , these two are not equivalent as we argued above .",
    "we may still construct probes in this more conventional sense by focusing only on geodesics of the type labeled ( a ) in  figure  [ fig : critpoints ] , as long as we keep the energy uv cutoff bounded @xmath136 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath119 . we will elaborate on these possibilities through explicit computations in the next section .",
    "note that these two prescriptions necessarily involve integrating out behind the apparent horizon .",
    "such a process may lead to entangled observables - as may be expected from  @xcite .",
    "it is now also clear that one should think of the uv completion of the theory as sitting at the throat @xmath87 .",
    "if we write the compton wavelength of an excitation in the pft of momentum @xmath112 as @xmath137 , we see that this length scale is bounded from below : at maximal momentum @xmath138 and @xmath87 , one probes this minimal length scale which scales as @xmath139 note that this scale is bigger than @xmath7 at strong coupling .",
    "the interactions in the theory seem to enhance the effects of non - locality .",
    "we can use  ( [ eq : puffmetric ] ) to easily see that that size @xmath140 of a probe or supergravity fluctuations goes as @xmath141 this is simply the redshift effect and leads to @xmath142 as expected .",
    "given that we use the momentum label @xmath112 for _ spacelike _ geodesics , it is more suitable to think of this parameter as a measure of spatial resolution .",
    "however the association of fuzz size to momentum in the pft is somewhat trickier than this simplest viewpoint . in the appendix ,",
    "we elaborate on this issue exploring a non - local version of the fourier transform relating size in @xmath64 to @xmath112 . in the main text , we confine the discussion to momentum space for simplicity .    in summary , figure  [ fig : uvirenergy ] shows plots of the two uv / ir relations encountered in the text .          in general , one expects that the correlators of the pft at strong coupling are to be related to the length of geodesics in the dual bulk spacetime . in the current",
    "setting , this map is however more elaborate .",
    "consider specifically spacelike geodesics of the geometry , with both endpoints fixed at the same @xmath143 at equal time ( see figure  [ fig : critpoints ] ) .",
    "we want to relate the length of such a geodesic to the equal time correlation function of an operator in the pft - along with a uv cutoff related to @xmath144 .",
    "we are then interested in the length for a round - trip from @xmath144 to @xmath118 and back to @xmath144 , given by @xmath145^{1/2 } \\right| \\nonumber \\\\      & = & 2\\,\\sqrt{\\alpha ' } g^{1/4 } \\left|\\int_{\\xi_{1,2}}^{\\xi_{cr } } d\\xi \\frac{\\left(1+\\xi ^6\\right)^{1/4}}{\\xi^2 \\left(\\xi -p^2 \\sqrt{1+\\xi^6}\\right)^{1/2}}\\right| \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the factor of @xmath146 is added since geodesics must go to the critical point and then back , and we may take @xmath147 if desired .",
    "we will henceforth denote the length of the geodesic that bounces off @xmath118 in the ir domain as @xmath148 , and the one bouncing in the uv domain as @xmath149 .",
    "next , we propose an extension to the holographic dictionary for computing correlators , one that is suited to the setting of the pft .",
    "we do this with the premise that the low energy or small momentum regimes of all observables reproduce the expected results from a local field theory , and that the proposal accounts for our analysis of uv - ir relations and congruences of null geodesics . for a probe of mass @xmath150 associated with a kaluza - klein mode",
    ", we heuristically have the following natural elements to map onto observables : @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind that - as we shall see in the next section - we always have @xmath155 , with @xmath156 in the low momentum regime .",
    "furthermore , the presence of an entanglement screen between the uv and the ir regimes suggests that we may need a product structure for the fock space .",
    "let it be the case that at least a sector of pft has its fock space represented by a product of _ two _ fock spaces - with the vacuum of one denoted by @xmath157 while the vacuum of the other being @xmath158 .",
    "we will think of the @xmath157 state as dual to the bulk spacetime with @xmath159 ; while @xmath158 is dual to the patch of spacetime bounded by @xmath160 .",
    "a vacuum configuration of the pft may have the form @xmath161 or perhaps one should consider instead @xmath162 where @xmath163 and @xmath164 are complex constants satisfying @xmath165 .",
    "we now want to find a natural map of various pft vevs onto geodesic length computations in the bulk ; and we want to do this in a way to make sense of our previous observations with regards to holography and uv - ir relations .",
    "consider first the density matrix @xmath166 where the trace is taken over the second fock space .",
    "this tracing corresponds in the bulk to integrating out dynamics in the region @xmath167 , behind the holographic screen . to construct a correlator",

    "other restrictions on our analysis discussed in section 2 can also be circumvented by duality transformations of the bulk space .",

    "a diverging number of degrees of freedom from the perspective of the ir regime suggests that the uv completion is a non - local theory akin to a string theory - with an infinite tower of excitations .",
    "however , there is another twist to the story : it is believed that c - functions in higher dimensions may be monotonic and decrease with lower energy scales , in analogy to the two dimensional scenario ; in this non - local theory , this function violates both of these properties .",
    "while the behavior in the ir domain is consistent with a c - function that is monotonically decreasing with lower energies , the function flips around at @xmath91 and again at @xmath296 in the uv domain .",
    "the first flip is consistent with associating a second theory as the holographic dual to the uv region of the bulk .",
    "the flip at @xmath296 is however perplexing .",
    "a c - function would fail the monotonicity condition if the bulk space does not satisfy the null energy condition .",
    "we can check this by computing the ricci tensors @xmath297 it is then easy to see that @xmath298 fails to be positive for any null geodesics if @xmath299 .",
    "this does not exactly match with the flip - over point @xmath296 because we approximated the effect of compactification to five dimensions by writing @xmath300 in computing  ( [ eq : cpuff ] ) .",
