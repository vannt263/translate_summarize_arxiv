    "massive star clusters are potentially useful test particles for constraining the evolutionary histories of their host galaxies",
    ". they can remain observable for the entire lifetime of a galaxy ( as illustrated by the old _ globular clusters _ which surround every major galaxy ) , and they are bright enough to be studied in detail well beyond the local group .",
    "the internal velocity broadening of their spectra is typically only a few km / s , making detailed abundance analysis at high spectral resolution feasible . in a previous paper we have taken a first step towards exploiting this potential by analysing @xmath0 and @xmath12-band spectra of a young massive star cluster ( ymc ) in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  6946 @xcite . here we apply a similar analysis to one of the young star clusters in the nearby ( post- ) starburst galaxy ngc  1569 .",
    "ngc  1569 was one of the first galaxies in which the presence of exceptionally bright , young star clusters was suspected .",
    "a spectrum of one of the two bright `` stellar condensations '' in ngc  1569 was obtained already by @xcite , although the true nature of these objects was probably first discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "they found that the spectra are of composite nature , and also noted that observations with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) would definitively settle the issue whether or not these objects are really `` super star clusters '' .",
    "indeed , pre - refurbishment mission hst observations by @xcite settled the issue by showing that both objects are extended , with half - light radii of about two pc . based on high - dispersion spectroscopy from the hires spectrograph on the keck  i telescope ,",
    "a dynamical mass of @xmath13 m@xmath11 was soon after estimated for the brighter of the two objects , ngc  1569-a @xcite .",
    "the clusters in ngc  1569 are prime candidates for abundance analysis in the near - infrared where they are very bright .",
    "the ir holds a particular advantage over optical studies for ngc  1569 due to the large amount of foreground extinction .",
    "@xcite found the integrated @xmath0-band spectra of both clusters a and b to be well approximated by red supergiant templates .",
    "although ngc  1569-a is the brighter of the two , it is actually a binary cluster itself with some evidence for a ( small ) age difference between the two components @xcite . whether or not the two components are physically connected or the result of a chance projection is unknown . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on ngc  1569-b .",
    "in addition to providing insight into the histories of their host galaxies , young star clusters with masses in excess of @xmath14 m@xmath11 also offer an excellent opportunity to study large samples of coeval massive stars .",
    "such clusters are rare in the milky way and even in the local group , so it is necessary to extend the search to a larger volume .",
    "the most massive known young star clusters in the milky way disk are westerlund 1 @xcite and an object discovered in the 2mass survey @xcite , both of which may have masses approaching @xmath14 m@xmath11 .",
    "young clusters of similar masses are found in the large magellanic cloud @xcite , but these pale in comparison with objects like ngc  1569-a and ngc  1569-b .",
    "we have obtained new nirspec @xmath0-band spectra of ngc  1569-b , optimised for abundance analysis , and we additionally present photometry for _ individual _ stars in the cluster derived from archival observations with the high resolution channel ( hrc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on hst .",
    "the hst data provide an independent verification of the stellar parameters ( notably @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) derived from the spectral analysis , and also allow us to compare the observed colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) with standard isochrones .",
    "finally , we use new measurements of the structural parameters and velocity dispersion to derive the cluster mass and mass - to - light ratio and compare with predictions by simple stellar population ( ssp ) models .",
    "we begin by briefly describing the data in  [ sec : data ] . the analysis and our main results",
    "then follow in  [ sec : results ] , where we first discuss the near - infrared spectroscopy and the abundance analysis (  [ sec : abundance ] ) .",
    "we then proceed to construct a cmd from the hst imaging (  [ sec : cmd ] ) from which we derive stellar parameters for the red supergiants ( rsgs ) that are compared against the spectroscopic results (  [ sec : speccmp ] ) and theoretical isochrones (  [ sec : interp ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec : virmass ] we measure structural parameters for ngc  1569-b and combine these with velocity dispersion measurements to derive a dynamical mass estimate .",
    "finally , some additional discussion and a summary are given in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we observed ngc  1569-b in the @xmath0-band with the nirspec spectrograph @xcite on the keck  ii telescope on 2006 november 8 , using the high resolution echelle mode with a slit width of @xmath17 ( 3 pixels ) .",
    "this yields a spectral resolution of @xmath18 .",
    "since the nirspec detector does not cover the entire @xmath0-band echellogram in a single exposure , we optimised the tilts of the nirspec gratings so that the number of features suitable for abundance determination was maximised . to facilitate easy sky subtraction , we followed the standard strategy of obtaining pairs of exposures nodded a few arcseconds along the slit .",
    "a total of 20 integrations , each with an exposure time of 300 s , were made , resulting in a total exposure time of 6000 s. one - dimensional spectra were extracted from each pair of nodded exposures and wavelength calibrated using the redspec idl package written by l.  prato , s.  s.  kim & i.  s.  mclean .",
    "the individual 1-d spectra were then co - added .",
    "the final summed 1-d spectra have a s / n of about 100 per pixel , or @xmath19 per 3 pixel resolution element .",
    "we use observations of ngc  1569 obtained with the acs hrc as part of programme gto-9300 ( p.i . :",
    "h.  ford ) .",
    "the hrc has a field of view of about @xmath20 and a pixel scale of @xmath21 pixel@xmath22 , but with significant variations across the field due to the geometric distortions in acs . for the photometry of individual stars we use the f555w ( @xmath23 v - band ) and f814w ( @xmath23 i - band ) images ,",
    "each exposed for @xmath24 s. for measurements of structural parameters we also include f330w ( @xmath23 u - band ) data ( @xmath25 s ) .",
    "the data were downloaded from the hst archive at the _ space telescope -",
    "european coordinating facility _",
    "( st - ecf ) and individual exposures were co - added with the multidrizzle task @xcite .",
    "multidrizzle filters out cosmic ray hits and detector defects , corrects for geometric distortions and projects the images on an orthogonal pixel grid with a scale of exactly @xmath26 pixel@xmath22 . at a distance of 2.2 mpc (  [ sec : dist ] ) , this corresponds to a linear scale of 0.27 pc pixel@xmath22 .",
    "while it is clear from the high degree of resolution into individual stars that ngc  1569 must be nearby , the exact distance remains quite uncertain .",
    "one uncertainty is in the correction for foreground extinction , for which the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) gives either @xmath27 mag @xcite or @xmath28 mag @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath29 or @xmath30 mag ( for @xmath31 ) .",
    "combined with the apparent distance modulus @xmath32 derived by @xcite , this leads to @xmath33 or @xmath34 mpc , which is the value used by @xcite and several other studies in the literature .",
    "based on photometry for a small number of yellow and blue supergiants and also using @xmath35 , @xcite estimated @xmath36 mpc . using observations of the red giant branch tip , @xcite derived two possible distances of either @xmath37 mpc or @xmath38 mpc , both assuming the schlegel et al .",
    "foreground extinction . for the lower @xcite extinction , the distances would instead be @xmath39 mpc or @xmath40 mpc . in this paper",
    "we use the same value of 2.2 mpc as @xcite and the extinction value from @xcite , i.e.  @xmath35 or @xmath41 mag ( @xmath42 mag ) .",
    "the abundance analysis is not affected by either of these parameters . for the analysis of the colour - magnitude diagram and the cluster mass we will give further comments when needed .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      having discussed the stellar content of ngc  1569-b , we now turn to a reexamination of its structural parameters and dynamical mass .",
    "we measured the size of the cluster in the acs / hrc images using our ishape code @xcite .",
    "the cluster size is determined by convolving a series of analytic model profiles with the psf and varying the model parameters until the best fit is obtained .",
    "we used `` eff '' profiles @xcite of the form @xmath43^{-\\eta } ,    \\label{eq : eff}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the core radius and @xmath45 determines the steepness of the profile at large radii . because neither the cluster itself nor the fitting profile has a clearly defined outer boundary , we experimented with various fitting radii up to 50 pixels ( 15 pc ) .",
    "[ fig : fitfig ] shows the image of the cluster , the best - fitting model , and the residuals for each band , for the largest fitting radius of 50 pixels .",
    "the resolution into individual stars means that the @xmath46 values of the fits never get close to unity , but otherwise the models provide a good fit to the data .",
    "the psfs used for the size measurements were based on daophot psfs in the inner regions ( @xmath47 pixels ) .",
    "we know from the smooth residual images produced by the allframe photometry that these psfs accurately represent the psfs of our images .",
    "however , for the ishape analysis we need to know the psf at larger radii than for the photometry , and there the construction of accurate empirical psfs becomes limited by decreasing s / n and non - uniformity of the background . for the analysis of structural parameters we therefore made use of composite psfs , constructed from the daophot psfs for @xmath47 pixels and using models computed by the tinytim package @xcite further out .",
    "table  [ tab : struct ] lists the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) along the major axis , the minor / major axis ratio ( b / a ) , the slope parameter @xmath45 , and the half - light radius @xmath48 for various fitting radii .",
    "all fits consistently yield an axis ratio of b / a@xmath49 , confirming the conclusion from earlier work that ngc  1569-b is significantly elongated @xcite . for @xmath50",
    "the total luminosity of the model profile is infinite , and @xmath48 therefore undefined .",
    "for some fits @xmath45 is close to unity , leading to unreasonably large @xmath48 values .",
    "we list two values for @xmath48 : one assuming that the profile extends to infinity ( @xmath51 ) and another assuming that it is truncated at @xmath52 pixels ( @xmath53 ) . for @xmath54",
    "the two @xmath48 values are similar , but for @xmath55 they differ substantially .",
    "the cut at @xmath52 pixels ( 30 pc ) is chosen fairly arbitrarily , apart from the fact that it is very difficult to trace the cluster profile to greater radii in the images .",

    "the formal errors on the fwhm values returned by ishape are generally less than @xmath59 pixels , so the trend with wavelength appears significant .",
    "the fwhm is roughly equal to twice the core radius @xmath44 of the eff profiles ( for @xmath60 this holds exactly ) so the trend in fwhm with wavelength is basically a trend in core radius .",
    "such a trend seems consistent with the finding by @xcite that ngc  1569-b has redder @xmath61 colours near the centre .",
    "however , they also found that the @xmath57 colours become _ bluer _ near the centre . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : colprof ] we show the @xmath56 and @xmath57 colours versus aperture radius for ngc  1569-b measured on the hrc data .",
    "the trends seen in this plot are very similar to those observed by hunter et al . , with @xmath56 becoming redder inwards and @xmath57 getting bluer .",
    "how can this be consistent with a monotonic decrease in cluster core radius with wavelength ?",
    "the answer appears to be that a nave comparison of colour gradients , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : colprof ] , neglects the effect of the psf .",
    "colour gradients can result from a combination of changes with wavelength in the structure of _ both _ the cluster _ and _ the psf .",
    "the psf behaviour with wavelength is not monotonic .",
    "due to the `` red halo '' effect , more light is scattered to large radii at longer wavelengths , but the encircled energy distributions tabulated in @xcite also show that more light is scattered to intermediate radii ( @xmath62  @xmath63 ) in f330w relative to f555w .",
    "this is also illustrated by the fact that the aperture corrections to infinity display a minimum around 5000 6000   ( fig .",
    "10 in * ? ? ?",
    "to investigate this further , we convolved the psf in f330w , f555w and f814w with eff models for the respective filters having fwhm of 5.0 , 4.5 and 4.0 pixels and envelope slopes of @xmath64 , 1.23 and 1.20 ( guided by the numbers in table  [ tab : struct ] ) .",
    "the centre panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : colprof ] shows the integrated colours versus aperture radius for these model profiles , normalised to match the observed colours at @xmath58 .",
    "although the intrinsic cluster core radius decreases monotonically with wavelength by design , we reproduce the observed trend towards bluer @xmath57 colours and redder @xmath56 colours near the centre .",
    "the bottom panel shows the colour - aperture relations for the pure eff models , as they would be observed in the absence of any convolution with the psf . in this case",
    "both the @xmath57 and @xmath56 colours become redder near the centre .",
    "we conclude that the colour gradients observed by @xcite ( and also seen in the hrc data ) are _ consistent _ with the monotonic decrease in the cluster fwhm with wavelength obtained from the ishape fits .",
    "because the envelope slope @xmath45 tends to be shallower at longer wavelengths , the correlation between fwhm and wavelength does not translate into a similarly strong trend of half - light radius @xmath48 versus wavelength .",
    "the @xmath51 values show a very larger scatter while most @xmath53 values are in the range 68 pixels or @xmath65@xmath66 . @xcite",
    "measured a half - light radius of @xmath67 on hst / wfpc images , while @xcite derived an almost identical value of @xmath68 from hst / wfpc2 images .",
    "our measurement on the acs / hrc images is slightly smaller , but an increase in the cut - off radius by a factor of 23 would bring our @xmath48 estimate into close agreement with previous studies . in the following ,",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath69 .",
    "ngc  1569-b is not the only ymc in which the structure has been found to be wavelength dependent .",
    "@xcite noted that the colours of a ymc in ngc  6946 become bluer in larger apertures .",
    "a trend of smaller cluster size at longer wavelengths was also found for the cluster m82-f by @xcite , who argued that it might be due to mass segregation ( although this result has been questioned by @xcite after a detailed analysis of the extinction near m82-f ) . because the rsgs are the most massive stars currently in the cluster , mass segregation would cause them to be more centrally concentrated , making the cluster appear smaller at longer wavelengths where the rsgs dominate .",
    "mass segregation may be either primordial in nature ( the most massive stars forming preferentially near the centre ) or a result of dynamical evolution ; in the latter case it is expected to occur on the half - mass relaxation time - scale which is @xmath70^{3/2 } n^{1/2}}{[m / m_\\odot]^{1/2 } } \\ , { \\rm years }    \\label{eq : trh}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the number of stars in the cluster and @xmath72 is the mean mass per star @xcite . for a total cluster mass of @xmath73 m@xmath11 (  [ sec : dynmass ] ) , a mean stellar mass of 0.6 m@xmath11 ( for a kroupa imf extending from 0.1 m@xmath11 to 100 m@xmath11 ) and @xmath74 pc , eq .",
    "( [ eq : trh ] ) yields @xmath75 years , about a factor of 25 longer than the current age of ngc  1569-b .",
    "thus , the cluster is not expected to be fully mass segregated , but this statement is subject to a few caveats .",
    "near the centre of the cluster , where the density is higher , the relaxation time will be shorter .",
    "furthermore , massive stars can `` sink '' to the centre on shorter time scales due to energy equipartition .",
    "the timescale for this to occur is inversely proportional to the mass of the stars in question @xcite , so stars with masses characteristic of the current rsgs might become segregated on time scales similar to the current age of ngc  1569-b . according to @xcite , dynamical mass segregation may occur even more rapidly if a cluster forms from subclumps which already have some degree of primordial mass segregation .",
    "alternatively , mass segregation may be imprinted in the structure of the cluster from the beginning ( e.g.  references in * ? ? ?",
    "whether or not mass segregation can actually explain the observed relations between cluster structure and wavelength is another question .",
    "@xcite calculated the difference @xmath76 between the @xmath77 colour inside and outside the half - light radius for a mass - segregated cluster as a function of time and found this to be 0.05  0.15 mag . using simple stellar population models by @xcite we estimate @xmath78 , so we may expect mass segregation to affect @xmath79 by a few times 0.01 mag . from the data plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : colprof ] we measure a difference @xmath80 mag , which appears roughly consistent with the calculations by fleck et al .",
    "so it seems that mass segregation _",
    "might _ be responsible for the observed colour gradients , although it would be desirable to investigate this in more detail .",

    "combined with reddening from schlegel et al . and",

    "@xcite list a reddening corrected apparent magnitude of @xmath87 or @xmath88 , close to the value given by anders et al . using a larger aperture of @xmath89 , @xcite list @xmath90 for @xmath35 and a distance of @xmath91 mpc , i.e.@xmath92 .",
    "most of the differences between published photometry can be ascribed to different choices of aperture radii . using the same aperture radii",
    ", we can largely reproduce the numbers given above .",
    "for the apertures and background annuli used by @xcite and @xcite , we obtain @xmath93 mag and @xmath94 mag .",
    "figure  [ fig : cog ] shows the integrated apparent @xmath95 magnitude as a function of aperture radius , demonstrating that the curve - of - growth never levels off completely out to at least @xmath96 .",
    "this is a generic difficulty for many young star clusters , which tend to have very extended outer envelopes with @xmath45-values close to 1 and hence poorly defined total luminosities @xcite .    per definition",
    ", the total luminosity of the cluster should be twice that contained within the effective radius .",
    "we can therefore estimate the total integrated magnitude by measuring the magnitude within @xmath48 and doubling the flux .",
    "from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : cog ] we get @xmath97 mag in apertures of @xmath98 .",
    "doubling the fluxes we then get @xmath99 , where the quoted error is due to the uncertainty on the half - light radius .",
    "this is consistent with the measurement of @xcite but brighter than measurements made in smaller apertures .",
    "however , this estimate of the integrated magnitude may still be a lower limit , because we have used a half - light radius that was already corrected for broadening by the psf .",
    "in reality , some fraction of the cluster light is scattered from the centre to larger radii by the psf , and we therefore expect that an aperture with the same radius as the intrinsic @xmath48 will contain slightly _ less _ than half of the total cluster luminosity . by carrying out aperture photometry on a simulated psf",

    "this raises the question whether one ( or both ) methods suffers from possible systematic errors , or if there might be a genuine difference between cluster and hii region abundances in ngc  1569  perhaps due to an ab initio oxygen enhancement of the gas out of which the cluster formed . since oxygen is the only element in common between the cluster and hii region data , a detailed comparison of the abundance patterns is unfortunately not possible .",
    "however , it is of interest to note that the very strong wolf - rayet features in the spectrum of cluster a also suggest a high metallicity @xcite .",
    "ngc  1569 is a popular target for testing models of chemical evolution , and it is generally recognised that the strong galactic wind observed in the galaxy must play an important role .",
    "@xcite observed a super - solar @xmath128 $ ] ratio for the wind , as we do for ngc  1569-b .",
    "however , it is unclear to what extent the two are related as material ejected in the outflow may not participate in star formation , and in any case not before it has had time to cool down and fall back into the galaxy .",
    "the chemical evolution of an ngc  1569-type galaxy has been modelled in detail by @xcite , assuming a variety of bursty star formation histories .",
    "their chemo - dynamical simulations show that elements produced in the last burst of star formation generally do not get mixed with the ism in the galaxy , but instead get injected into the hot gas phase .",
    "none of their models produce an o abundance as high as the one observed by us , and the model that comes closest ( @xmath129 ( o / h ) @xmath130 ) severely underpredicts the n / o abundance of the hii regions observed by @xcite .",
    "generally , the best fits to the hii region abundances are obtained for a `` gasping '' star formation history , but these models all predict a maximum @xmath129 ( o / h ) @xmath23 8.1 .",
    "similarly , the o abundance predicted by the models of @xcite for ngc  1569 never exceeds @xmath129 ( o / h ) = 8.41 .",
    "we speculate that the galactic wind which is responsible for removing metals may be less efficient in doing so near the bottom of the potential well where the massive clusters formed .",
    "unfortunately , none of the models include predictions for the wide range of other elements we are observing here .",
    "the small magellanic cloud presents an interesting comparison case .",
    "early spectroscopic studies and strmgren photometry indicated that the young cluster ngc  330 is about 0.5 dex more metal - poor than the surrounding field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopy by @xcite showed a smaller and only marginally significant difference between the field stars and ngc  330 , although still in the sense that the cluster is more metal - poor than the field ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath131 vs.= @xmath132 ) .",
    "the [ o / fe ] abundance ratios in these stars were all found to be sub - solar ( [ o / fe ] @xmath23 @xmath1330.15 to @xmath1330.3 dex ) , as in the lmc and in young galactic supergiants @xcite . @xcite also found the @xmath2-elements abundances ( mg , ca , ti ) relative to fe to be around solar for ngc  330 .",
    "@xcite found slightly lower iron abundances of [ fe / h ] = @xmath134 for k supergiants in ngc  330 than @xcite and an [ o / fe ] ratio closer to solar .",
    "they derived somewhat enhanced [ ca / fe ] , [ si / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] ratios ( @xmath135 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 ) , in contrast to sub - solar ratios derived for b stars .",
    "while there is some evidence for a difference in metallicity between ngc  330 and the smc field , the situation there seems to contrast with the case of ngc  1569-b where we find a _ higher _ oxygen abundance of the cluster compared to the hii regions and an _ enhanced _ [ o / fe ] ratio .",
    "our mean [ @xmath2/fe ] = @xmath3 is also higher than that derived for the stars in ngc  330 .",
    "one significant difference may be the mass of ngc  1569-b , which is probably an order of magnitude greater than that of ngc  330 @xcite .",
    "the spectral analysis returns a mean @xmath6 k and @xmath138 for the rsgs in ngc  1569-b . we have checked these values using resolved photometry of the rsgs in the cluster , derived from archival hst / acs images .",
    "about 60 rsgs are easily identifiable in the colour - magnitude diagram , and from their @xmath139 colours we derive a mean effective temperature of @xmath140 k and @xmath141 .",
    "an even closer match to the spectroscopic @xmath15 is obtained if we weigh the @xmath15 estimates for the individual stars by their @xmath0-band luminosities , in which case we get @xmath142 k.    we have compared the cmd with @xmath143 and @xmath114 isochrones from the padua and geneva groups .",
    "both sets of models provide the best match to the observed colours and magnitudes of the rsgs for @xmath114 and ages of 1525 myrs , but no isochrone can reproduce the observed cmd in detail . for these sub - solar metallicities ,",
    "the models predict higher ( by up to a few 100 k ) mean effective temperatures @xmath144 for the rsgs than observed .",
    "since the rsgs generally become cooler with increasing metallicity , models of higher metallicity are favoured , but models of solar metallicity would be required to match the observed colours .",
    "for such models , however , the _ blue _ supergiants become much too cool to match the observations .",
    "the observed ratio of blue to red supergiants ( bsg / rsg = @xmath145 ) is also significantly lower than most of the model predictions .",
    "although we are detecting an impressive number of rsgs , it should be noted that since we are only resolving stars located well outside the half - light radius , the actual number of rsgs in ngc  1569-b is likely to be more than a factor of two greater than the number we have detected .",
    "we derive a velocity dispersion of @xmath8 km / s from the integrated spectrum of ngc  1569-b , somewhat higher than the value of 7.5 km / s of @xcite . combining this with an estimate of the cluster half - light radius of @xmath9 measured on the acs images , we obtain a dynamical mass of @xmath146",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the mass predicted by simple stellar population models for a cluster of this age and luminosity and a standard imf .",
    "a correction for mass segregation would bring the two estimates into even closer agreement .    our analysis of structural parameters reveals a decrease in core radius with wavelength for ngc  1569-b .",
    "this trend is consistent with the colour gradients observed by @xcite and by us in the hrc data when variations in the psf are taken into account .",
    "a similar colour gradient was observed in an ymc in ngc  6946 @xcite .",
    "the correlation between core radius and wavelength is also in the same sense as that found for m82-f by @xcite and may be an indication that mass segregation ( primordial or dynamical ) is present in ngc  1569-b .",
    "however , this needs to be confirmed by a more detailed analysis , including a modelling of how mass segregation would translate into observables such as core- and half - light radius .    as a final note",
    ", we find it fascinating to contemplate that only a couple of decades ago , it was still uncertain whether ngc  1569-a and ngc  1569-b were in fact star clusters in ngc  1569 or mere foreground stars . today , the advanced camera for surveys on hst has made it possible to not only settle this question definitively , but to study the individual stars that make up these clusters .",
