    "the minimum conditional entropy of eq .",
    "( [ eq : conditionalentropy ] ) was obtained by scanning the measurement on photon @xmath1 .",
    "quantum discord and classical correlation were obtained from the final states reconstructed by quantum state tomography@xcite . for an initial state with @xmath213 and @xmath214 ( @xmath215=0 and @xmath216=0 ) ,",
    "there is a sudden transition from the classical decoherence to the quantum decoherence regime@xcite , as shown in figure 2 ( the transition point is represented by the crossover of the four panes with different colors ) .",
    "the figure also shows the non - entanglement quantum correlation , which exhibits a sudden change in the decay rate@xcite .",
    "quantum discord monotonically decays after the sudden transition point , while entanglement suffers from sudden death after a certain period .",
    "the experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions . for a different initial state with @xmath217 and @xmath218 ,",
    "quantum correlation is larger than classical correlation as the system evolves , disproving an early conjecture that classical correlation is always larger than quantum correlation@xcite .",
    "the non - markovian dynamics of classical and quantum correlations was further investigated in an all - optical setup by xu _ et al._@xcite . in their experiment ,",
    "the group simulated a non - markovian channel using a fabry - perot cavity followed by quartz plates acting on one of the two photons .",
    "the fabry - perot cavity filtered the frequency distribution of the photon , leading to a refocusing effect of the relative phase in the dephasing environment and inducing the non - markovian effect .",
    "the sudden transition from the classical to the quantum decoherence regime occurred at the beginning of the evolution , similar to the case in fig .",
    "2 . under such a non - markovian environment ,",
    "the quantum correlation ( measured by the relative entropy of discord@xcite and calculated from the reconstructed density matrixes ) revived from near zero before decaying again in the subsequent evolution .",
    "however , there was not revival of the classical correlation , which remained constant over the same period .",
    "this phenomenon is explained by the weak non - markovian effect .",
    "the authors theoretically showed that both classical and quantum correlations are revived with a narrower frequency width ( i.e. stronger non - markovian effect ) .",
    "the group further implemented an @xmath219 operation on the photon under decoherence and investigated the corresponding correlation dynamics .",
    "this process found a sudden transition from the quantum to the classical revival regime , as well as correlation echoes .",
    "experimental investigations of quantum discord and classical correlation under decoherence have also been implemented using nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) systems . because of the high - temperature expansion , a typical nmr - system density matrix for the effect two - qubit case can be written as @xmath220 , where @xmath47 is the identity matrix , @xmath221 is the thermal energy , and @xmath222 represents the deviation density matrix@xcite that can be reconstructed by quantum state tomography . under the action of a global environment , soares - pinto _",
    "et al._@xcite investigated the dynamics of correlations in a nmr quadrupolar system .",
    "the symmetric classical and quantum correlations@xcite , which were computed from an experimentally reconstructed deviation - density matrix , were found to both decay exponentially .",
    "these experimental results agree well with the theoretical predictions .",
    "the authors further showed that , depending on the initial states , the classical correlation could be larger or smaller than the quantum correlation during the system evolution .    the sudden change in behavior in correlation dynamics has been further demonstrated in the nmr systems at room temperature@xcite . after preparing different kinds of initial bell - diagonal states with specific relations between their components , the authors left the systems to evolve freely under decoherence .",
    "the environment of such an nmr system can be modeled by two independent quantum channels : the phase - damping and amplitude - damping channels .",
    "the authors observed a sudden change phenomenon for quantum discord and its classical counterpart due to the presence of phase - damping noise .",
    "on the other hand , the amplitude - damping noise led to a small decay of the classical correlation compared to a constant classical correlation after the sudden change point .",
    "note also that the two nuclear spins finally relaxed to the gibbs states .",
    "experimental investigation of quantum and classical correlations usually requires full quantum state tomography and their resulting numerical calculations .",
    "however , the concept of witnessing the quantumness of correlations recently received a great deal of attention .",
    "for a two - qubit states with the form of @xmath223 , maziero and serra@xcite obtained a sufficient condition for the states to be only classically correlated @xmath224 in this equation , @xmath225 , with @xmath64 , and @xmath226 with @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : witness ] ) is also shown to be a necessary condition for the bell - diagonal states .",
    "the value of @xmath229 ( @xmath230 ) can be changed to @xmath231 with @xmath232u_{a\\rightarrow b}$ ] . in this equation , @xmath233 with @xmath234 representing a local rotation with angle @xmath235 around direction @xmath236 on qubit @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , and @xmath241 represents the controlled - not gate between qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 with @xmath0 as the control qubit .",
    "_ experimentally demonstrated@xcite such a witness in a nmr system at room temperature by preparing different kinds of bell - diagonal states ( in this case @xmath242 ) and performing a corresponding witness circuit , and the schematic setup is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : witness ] ( where the evolution process is added in the case considering the witness dynamics ) . for each initial state ,",
    "the experimental process was carried out three times to obtain the values @xmath243 for determining the witness in eq .",
    "( [ eq : witness ] ) .",
    "quantum state tomography and numerical optimization were used to calculate correlation values for comparison , and they agreed well with the witness results .",
    "the authors further investigated the decoherence dynamics of the witness with a freely evolving initial state .",
    "the witness tended to be 0 , with the two - spin state evolving to a state with only classical correlation .",
    "experimental investigation of quantum discord has now been extended to solid systems . in a recent experiment ,",
    "a system of electron and nuclear spin in a phosphorous donor in silicon was observed by generating a series of separable thermal states with different anisotropic parameters@xcite .",
    "the authors observed nonzero quantum discord and found that there were sudden change behaviors of the quantum discord during tuning of the anisotropic parameters .",
    "there are also other experimental works concerning total quantum correlations ; e.g. a modified correlation witness@xcite and the space of quantum correlations@xcite .",
    "these types of systems could provide an intriguing perspective on the dynamics of quantum discord , and help to better determine different experimental technologies .",
    "past investigations of quantum discord in open quantum systems have helped to disclose the particular dynamical behaviors of discord , as well as applications of both fundamental and practical importance .",
    "nevertheless , observations of markovian zero - discord classicality@xcite , and the unusual response of quantum discord to temperature@xcite , still show that further investigations on the quantifications of quantum and classical correlations are required .",
    "another arresting aspect is that quantum discord can be created under local operations@xcite , which is different from that of entanglement@xcite .",
    "_ suggested@xcite that quantum discord should be interpreted as the local measure of quantumness , not necessarily as the number of quantum correlations . as a result ,",
    "the problem of classifying quantum and classical correlations is still open despite the existence of the many different ways to measure nonclassical correlation introduced in part 2 .    from the above theoretical and experimental investigations",
    ", we can see that the time evolutions of both quantum discord and classical correlation in open quantum systems can be deduced from the time evolution of the initial states by using quantum state tomography and optimization calculations ( or the corresponding witness circuits ) .",
    "inspired by the factorization law of entanglement evolution in noisy quantum channels@xcite , we expect that a similar simple relationship exists to characterize quantum correlation in a noisy environment .",
    "it has already been shown that any quantum correlation should be related to the amount of entanglement@xcite .",
    "therefore , suitable quantification of nonclassical correlations is needed to meet this mission .",
    "more experimental works must be done to further understand quantum discord , especially to clarify the quantum advantages in quantum information processing and to demonstrate their fundamental applications . however , increasing interest in this type of work will certainly lead to more distinctive discoveries in this field .",
