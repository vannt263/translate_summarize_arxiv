    "with a  widespread use of simple motion - tracking devices e.g. nintendo wii remoteor accelerometer units in cell phones , the importance of motion - based interfaces in human - computer interaction ( hci ) systems has become unquestionable .",
    "commercial success of early motion - capture devices led to the development of more robust and versatile acquisition systems , both mechanical , e.g. cyberglove systems cyberglove , measurand shapewrap , dgtech dg5vhand and optical e.g. microsoft kinect , asus wavi xtion .",
    "also , the interest in the analysis of a human motion itself @xcite , @xcite , @xcite has increased in the past few years .    while problems related to gesture recognition received much attention , an interesting yet less explored problem is the task of recognising a human based on his gestures .",
    "this problem has two main applications : the first one is the creation of a gesture - based biometric authentication system , able to verify access for authenticated users .",
    "the other task is related to personalisation of applications with a motion component . in such scenario",
    "an effective classifier is required to recognise between known users .",
    "the goal of our experiment is to classify humans based on motion data in the form of natural hand gestures .",
    "today s simple motion - based interfaces usually limit users options to a subset of artificial , well distinguishable gestures or just detection of the presence of body motion .",
    "we argue that an interface should be perceived by the users as natural and adapt to their needs . while modern motion - capture systems provide accurate recordings of human body movement , creation of a hci interface based on acquired data is not a trivial task .",
    "many popular gestures are ambiguous thus the meaning of a gesture is usually not obvious for an observer and requires parsing of a complex context .",
    "there are differences in body movement during the execution of a particular gesture performed by different subjects or even in subsequent repetitions by the same person .",
    "some gestures may become unrecognisable with respect to a particular capturing device , when important motion components are unregistered , due to device limitations or its suboptimal calibration .",
    "we aim to answer the question if high - dimensional hand motion data is distinctive enough to provide a basis for personalisation component in a system with motion - based interface .    in our works we concentrated on hand gestures , captured with two mechanical motion - capture systems .",
    "such approach allows to experiment with reliable multi - source data , obtained directly from the device , without additional processing .",
    "we used a gesture database of twenty two natural gestures performed by a number of participants with varying execution speeds .",
    "the gesture database is described in @xcite .",
    "we compare the effectiveness of three established classifiers namely linear discrimination analysis ( lda ) , support vector machines ( svm ) and k - nearest neighbour ( k - nn ) .",
    "the following experiment scenarios are considered in this paper :    * human recognition based on the performance of one selected gesture ( e.g. ` waving a hand',`grasping an object ' ) .",
    "user must perform one specified gesture to be identified .",
    "* the scenario when instead of one selected gesture , a set of multiple gestures is used both for training and for testing .",
    "user must perform one of several gestures to be identified . * the scenario when different gestures are used for training and for testing of the classifier .",
    "user is identified based on one of several gestures , none of which were used for training the classifier .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 ( related work ) presents a selection of works on similar subjects , section 3 ( method ) describes the experiment , results are presented in section 4 ( results ) , along with authors remarks on the subject .",
    "existing approaches to the creation of an hci interface that are based on dynamic hand gestures can be categorized according to : the motion data gathering method , feature selection , the pattern classification technique and the domain of application .",
    "hand data gathering techniques can be divided into : device - based , where mechanical or optical sensors are attached to a glove , allowing for measurement of finger flex , hand position and acceleration , e.g. @xcite , and vision - based , when hands are tracked based on the data from optical sensors e.g. @xcite .",
    "a survey of glove - based systems for motion data gathering , as well as their applications can be found in @xcite , while @xcite provides a comprehensive analysis of the integration of various sensors into gesture recognition systems .",
    "while non - invasive vision - based methods for gathering hand movement data are popular , device - based techniques receive attention due to widespread use of motion sensors in mobile devices .",
    "for example @xcite presents a high performance , two - stage recognition algorithm for acceleration signals , that was adapted in samsung cell phones .",
    "extracted features may describe not only the motion of hands but also their estimated pose .",
    "a review of literature regarding hand pose estimation is provided in @xcite .",
    "creation of a gesture model can be performed using multiple approaches including hidden markov models e.g. @xcite or dynamic bayesian networks e.g. @xcite . for hand gesture recognition ,",
    "application domains include : sign language recognition e.g. @xcite , robotic and computer interaction e.g. @xcite , computer games e.g. @xcite and virtual reality applications e.g. @xcite .    relatively new application of hci elements are biometric technologies aimed to recognise a person based on their physiological or behavioural characteristic .",
    "a survey of behavioural biometrics is provided in @xcite where authors examine types of features used to describe human behaviour as well as compare accuracy rates for verification of users using different behavioural biometric approaches .",
    "simple gesture recognition may be applied for authentication on mobile devices e.g. in @xcite authors present a study of light - weight user authentication system using an accelerometer while a multi - touch gesture - based authentication system is presented in @xcite .",
    "typically however , instead of hand motion more reliable features like hand layout @xcite or body gait @xcite are employed .    despite their limitations , linear classifiers",
    "@xcite proved to produce good results for many applications , including face recognition @xcite and speech detection @xcite . in @xcite lda",
    "is used for the estimation of consistent parameters to three model standard types of violin bow strokes .",
    "authors show that such gestures can be effectively presented in the bi - dimensional space . in @xcite , the lda classifier",
    "was compared with neural networks ( nn ) and focused time delay neural networks ( tdnn ) for gesture recognition based on data from a 3-axis accelerometer .",
    "lda gave similar results to the nn approach , and the tdnn technique , though computationally more complex , achieved better performance .",
    "an analysis of lda and the pca algorithm , with a discussion about their performance for the purpose of object recognition is provided in @xcite .",
    "svm and k - nn classifiers were used in @xcite for the purpose of visual category recognition .",
    "a comparison of the effectiveness of these method is classification of human gait patterns is provided in @xcite .",
    "thorough analysis of a gesture dataset used in the experiments , along with a discussion on the benefits of naturality of hci interface elements can be found in @xcite .",
    "pca analysis of the same dataset together with visualization of eigengestures can be found in @xcite .",
    "the general idea is to recognise a gesture performer .",
    "experiment data consist of data from ` iitis gesture database ' that contains natural gestures performed by multiple participants .",
    "three classifiers will be used .",
    "pca will be performed on the data to reduce its dimensionality .",
    "a set of twenty - two natural hand gesture classes from ` iitis gesture database ' @xcite , tab .",
    "[ id : table : gesturelist ] , was used in the experiments .",
    "gestures used in this experiments were recorded with two types of hardware ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gestures_intro ] ) .",
    "first one was the dgtech dg5vhand motion capture glove @xcite , containing 5 finger bend sensors ( resistance type ) , and three - axis accelerometer producing three acceleration and two orientation readings .",
    "sampling frequency was approximately 33 hz .",
    "the second one was cyberglove systems cyberglove with a cyberforce system for position and orientation measurement .",
    "the device produces 15 finger bend , three position and four orientation readings with a frequency of approximately 90 hz .    during the experiment ,",
    "each participant was sitting at the table with the motion capture glove on their right hand . before the start of the experiment ,",
    "the hand of the participant was placed on the table in a fixed initial position . at the command given by the operator sitting in front of the participant ,",
    "the participant performed the gestures .",
    "each gesture was performed six times at natural pace , two times at a rapid pace and two times at a slow pace .",
    "gestures number 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 21 are periodical and in their case a single performance consisted of three periods .",
    "the termination of data acquisition process was decided by the operator .",
    "figure [ fig : lda_projection ] presents the result of performing lda ( further described in subsection [ lda ] ) on the dataset : projection of the dataset on the first two components of @xmath0 for both devices .",
    "it can be observed that many gestures are linearly separable . in the majority of visible gesture classes ,",
    "elements are centred around their respectable mean , with an almost uniform variance .",
    "potential conflicts for small number of gestures may be observed for local regions of the projected data space .",
    "a motion capture recording performed with a  device with @xmath1 sensors generates a time sequence of vectors @xmath2 . for the purpose of our work",
    "each recording was linearly interpolated and re - sampled to @xmath3 samples , generating data matrices @xmath4\\in{\\mathbb{r}}^{m\\times t}$ ] , where @xmath5 enumerates recordings .",
    "then data matrices were normalized by computing the t - statistics @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are mean and standard deviation for a given sensor @xmath9 taken over all @xmath5 recordings in the database .",
    "subsequently every matrix @xmath10 for was vectorized row - by - row , so that it was transformed into data vector @xmath11^t,\\ ] ] belonging to @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "these data vectors were organised into @xmath14 ( for dg5vhand ) and @xmath15 ( for cyberglove ) classes @xmath16 corresponding to participants registered with each device .",
    "principal component analysis @xcite may be defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath17 $ ] be the data matrix , where @xmath18 are data vectors with zero empirical mean .",
    "the associated covariance matrix is given by @xmath19 . by performing eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath20 such that eigenvalues @xmath21 of @xmath22 are ordered in descending order @xmath23",
    "one obtains the sequence of principal components @xmath24 $ ] which are columns of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "one can form a feature vector @xmath26 of dimension @xmath27 by calculating @xmath28^t \\mathbf{x}.$ ]      linear discriminant analysis  thoroughly presented in @xcite  is a supervised , discriminative technique producing an optimal linear classification function , which transforms the data from @xmath29 dimensional space @xmath30 into a lower - dimensional classification space @xmath31 .",
    "let the _ between - class scatter matrix _",
    "@xmath32 be defined as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes mean of class means @xmath35",
    "i.e. @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the number of samples in class @xmath9 . let _ within - class scatter matrix _",
    "@xmath38 be @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total number of the samples in all classes .",
    "the eigenvectors of matrix @xmath41 ordered by their respective eigenvalues are called the canonical vectors . by selecting first @xmath42 canonical vectors and arranging them row by row as the projection matrix @xmath43 any vector @xmath44",
    "can be projected onto a lower - dimensional feature space @xmath45 .",
    "using lda one can effectively apply simple classifier e.g. for @xmath46-class problem .",
    "a vector @xmath47 is classified to class @xmath48 if following inequality is observed @xmath49for all @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 denotes euclidean norm .",
    "note that when the amount of available data is limited , lda technique may result in the matrix @xmath38 that is singular . in this case",
    "one can use moore - penrose pseudoinverse @xcite .",
    "matrix @xmath52 is replaced by moore - penrose pseudoinverse matrix @xmath53 and canonical vectors are eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath46-nearest neighbour ( @xmath46-nn ) method @xcite classifies the sample by assigning it to the most frequently represented class among k nearest samples .",
    "it may be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath55 be a training set where @xmath56 denotes class labels , and @xmath18 , are feature vectors .",
    "for a nearest neighbour classification , given a new observation @xmath57 , first a nearest element @xmath58 of a learning set is determined @xmath59 with euclidean distance @xmath60 @xmath61 and resulting class label is @xmath62 .",
    "usually , instead of only one observation from @xmath63 , @xmath46 most similar elements are considered .",
    "therefore , counts of class labels for @xmath64 are determined for each class @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes dirac delta .",
    "the class label is determined as most common class present in the results @xmath67    note that in case of multiple classes or single class and even @xmath46 there may be a tie in the top class counts ; in that case results may be dependent on data order and behaviour of @xmath68 implementation .",
    "support vector machines ( svm ) presented in @xcite are supervised learning methods based on the principle of constructing a hyperplane separating classes with the largest margin of separation between them .",
    "the margin is the sum of distances from the hyperplane to closest data points of each class .",
    "these points are called support vectors .",
    "svms can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath69 be a set of linearly separable training samples where @xmath70 denotes class labels .",
    "we assume the existence of a @xmath71-dimensional hyperplane ( @xmath72 denotes dot product ) @xmath73 separating @xmath57 in @xmath74 .",
    "the distance between separating hyperplanes satisfying @xmath75 and @xmath76 is @xmath77 .",
    "the optimal separating hyperplane can be found by minimising @xmath78 under the constraint @xmath79 for all @xmath80 .",
    "when the data is not linearly separable , a hyperplane that maximizes the margin while minimizing a quantity proportional to the misclassification errors is determined by introducing positive slack variables @xmath81 in the equation [ equation : svm:1 ] , wchich becomes : @xmath82 and the equation ( [ equation : svm:2 ] ) is changed into : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a penalty factor chosen by the user , that controls the trade off between the margin width and the misclassification errors .",
    "when the decision function is not a linear function of the data , an initial mapping @xmath85 of the data into a higher dimensional euclidean space @xmath86 is performed as @xmath87 and the linear classification problem is formulated in the new space .",
    "the training algorithm then only depends on the data through dot product in @xmath86 of the form @xmath88 .",
    "the mercer s theorem @xcite allows to replace @xmath89 by a positive definite symmetric kernel function @xmath90 , e.g. gaussian radial - basis function @xmath91 , for @xmath92 .",
    "our objective was to evaluate the performance of user identification based on performed gestures . to this end , in our experiment class labels",
    "are assigned to subsequent humans performing gestures ( performers ids were recorded during database acquisition ) .",
    "three experiment scenarios were investigated , differing by the range of gestures used for recognition .",
    "the three classification methods described before were used , evaluated in two - stage @xmath46-fold cross validation scheme .",
    "three scenarios related to data labelling were prepared :    * scenario a. human classification using specific gesture .",
    "each gesture was treated as a separated case , and a classifier was created and verified using samples from this particular gesture .",
    "* scenario b. human classification using a set of known gestures .",
    "data from multiple gestures was used in the experiment . whenever the data was divided into a teaching and testing subset , proportional amount of samples for each gesture were present in both sets . *",
    "scenario c. human classification using separate gesture sets . in this scenario",
    "the data from multiple gestures was used , similarly to scenario b. however , teaching subset was created using different gestures than a testing subset .",
    "the three classifiers were used , with the following parameter ranges :    * lda , with number of features @xmath93 ; * @xmath46-nn , with number of neighbours @xmath94 ; * svm , with radial basis function ( rbf ) and @xmath95 .",
    "common parameters values found by cross - validation :    * lda , @xmath96 features * @xmath46-nn , @xmath97 neighbours for scenarios b , c , @xmath98 for scenario c ; * svm , @xmath99 @xmath100 .    the parameter selection and classifier performance evaluation",
    "was performed by splitting the available data into training and testing subset in two - stage @xmath46-fold cross validation ( c.v . )",
    "scheme , with @xmath101 .",
    "inner c.v . stage corresponds to grid search parameter optimization and model selection .",
    "the outer stage corresponds to final performance evaluation .",
    "the pca was performed on the whole data set before classifier training .",
    "the amount of principal components was chosen empirically as @xmath102 .",
    ".classification accuracy ( % ) for three considered scenarios . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the accuracy of the classifiers for three discussed scenarios is presented in tab .",
    "[ id : table : mean_accuracy ] .",
    "confusion matrices for experiments b , c are presented on figure [ fig : confusion_matrices ] .",
    "high classification accuracy can be observed for scenarios @xmath103 and @xmath104 when a classifier is provided with training data for specific gesture . in scenario c , however , the accuracy corresponds to a situation when a performer is recognised based on an unknown gesture .",
    "while the classification accuracy is lower than in previous scenarios , it should be noted that the classifier was created using a limited amount of high - dimensional data .",
    "the difference between the accuracy for both devices can be explained by significantly higher precision of a cyberglove device , where hand position is captured using precise rig instead of an array of accelerometers .",
    "c| c c c c & & lda & @xmath46-nn & svc + &    & & & + &    & & & + &    & & & + &    & & &    results of the experiment show that even linear classifiers can be successfully employed for recognition of human performers based on their natural gestures .",
    "relatively high accuracy for experiment c indicates that the general characteristics of a human natural body movement is highly discriminative , even for different gesture patterns .",
    "while mechanical devices used in experiments provide accurate measurements of body movements , they may be replaced by less cumbersome data gathering device e.g. microsoft kinect .",
    "experiments confirm that natural hand gestures are highly discriminative and allow for an accurate classification of their performers .",
    "applications of such solution allow e.g. to personalise tools and interfaces to suit the needs of their individual users .",
    "however , a separate problem lies in the detection of particular gesture performer based on general hand motion .",
    "such task requires deeper understanding of motion characteristics as well as identification of individual features of human motion .",
