    "recently , the interplay of chaos and quantum interference in @xmath3 quantum dots has intrigued experimentalists and theorists alike .",
    "the quantum interference effects , @xmath4 .",
    ", ballistic weak localization ( bwl )  @xcite and ballistic conductance fluctuation  @xcite in such structures depend on whether the underlying classical dynamics is regular or chaotic .",
    "therefore , these effects are interesting from the viewpoint of the theory of @xmath5 @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we predicted that @xmath2 oscillation of magnetoconductance , analogous to altshuler - aronov - spivak ( aas ) effect  @xcite in disordered systems  @xcite , should be observable in a single @xmath3 aharonov - bohm ring ( hereafter called ab billiard ) with magnetic flux penetrating @xmath7 through the hollow  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon of conductance oscillation is caused by the interference between a pair of time - reversed coherent back - scattering classical paths that wind the center obstacle in the billiard .",
    "we calculated the diagonal part of the bwl correction to the wave - number averaged reflection coefficient by use of semiclassical scattering ( scs ) theory  @xcite .",
    "our analysis  @xcite yielded for the @xmath8 ab billiard @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the magnetic flux quantum and @xmath11 is the magnetic flux that penetrates the hollow . in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : aas1 ] ) @xmath12 , where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are system - dependent constants and correspond to the variance of the winding number distribution  @xcite , the dwelling time for the shortest classical orbit and the escape rate  @xcite , respectively . in this case",
    ", the oscillation amplitude decays exponentially with increasing rank of higher harmonics @xmath16 , so that the main contribution to the conductance oscillation comes from the @xmath16=1 component that oscillates with the period of @xmath17/2@xmath18 .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( kolmogorov - arnold - moser tori and chaotic sea ) ab billiard , we obtained  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the hypergeometric function of confluent type and the exponent of dwelling time distribution @xmath24  @xcite , respectively .",
    "( [ eqn : aas2 ] ) the oscillation amplitude decays algebraically for large @xmath16 , and therefore the higher - harmonics components give noticeable contribution to magnetoconductance oscillations .",
    "these discoveries indicate that _ the @xmath2 aas oscillation occurs in both ballistic and diffusive systems forming the ab geometry and the behavior of higher harmonics components reflects a difference between chaotic and non - chaotic classical dynamics_.    in real experiments , however , the magnetic field would be applied to the @xmath25 region ( both the hollow and annulus ) in the billiard .",
    "thus it is indispensable to apply the scs theory to this case , in order to see the comparison between the experimental data and theoretical prediction . in this situation",

    "therefore , the main contribution to the conductance oscillation comes from the @xmath16=1 component , which oscillates with period @xmath92 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with our previous specific result [ i.e. , eq .",

    "in addition to this property , the oscillation amplitude damps exponentially with increasing magnetic field .",
    "on the other hand , for regular cases ( the square ab billiard ) the form of @xmath64 has been estimated as @xmath93 from the numerical simulation [ see fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . in the calculation we injected @xmath94 particles into the billiard . in eq . ( [ eqn : a14 ] ) @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are also fitting parameters and @xmath85 is approximately the average area between the outer and inner squares in this case .",
    "this distribution leads to  @xcite @xmath100 where @xmath101 since @xmath102 is equal to the fourier transform of a power - law function , one can expect a cusplike bwl peak near zero magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to chaotic cases , the oscillation amplitude decays algebraically for @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we can see that higher - harmonics components give a significant contribution to conductance oscillations .",
    "this is because the number of multiple - winding trajectories is much larger in regular billiards than in chaotic billiards .",
    "in this section we shall discuss in more detail the difference of @xmath103 between chaotic and regular ab billiards . in fig .",
    "2 we show @xmath103 for sinai ( chaotic ) and square ab ( regular ) billiards .",
    "the values of the fitting parameters , determined by the classical simulation , are substituted into eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : a13 ] ) and ( [ eqn : a15 ] ) .",
    "in order to see the marked difference of the @xmath104 dependence of @xmath103 , we shall investigate the @xmath105 term in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : a13 ] ) and ( [ eqn : a15 ] ) , denoted as @xmath106 and the @xmath107 term , denoted as @xmath108 , separately , i.e. ,    = 8.5 cm    @xmath109    figure 3(a ) shows @xmath106 which contributes to the negative magnetoresistance for two types of billiards .",
    "the shapes of @xmath106 in the vicinity of zero magnetic field are quite different between chaotic and regular billiards , i.e. , a quadratic curve versus a linear line [ see the inset in fig .",
    "3(a ) ] . for large @xmath104 ( but with the cyclotron radius sufficiently large compared to the system dimension ) , @xmath106 saturates in chaotic cases , but shows nosaturation in regular cases . similarly , the @xmath108 corresponding to the @xmath2 aas - like oscillation part is indicated in fig.3(b ) .",
    "while the oscillation amplitude damps rapidly with increasing @xmath104 for the chaotic ab billiard , it damps gently for regular ab billiards .",
    "therefore , on the basis of the above results , the qualitative difference of @xmath103 between chaotic and regular ab billiards is attributed to the different classical distribution of the effective areas .",
    "as the dimension of the center obstacle ( e.g. , @xmath110 for a sinai billiard and @xmath111 for a square ab billiard ) becomes zero , the oscillation structure of @xmath64 is indistinct for two types of billiard , so that the @xmath2 conductance oscillation would disappear .    to consolidate the above semiclassical prediction of the @xmath17/2@xmath18 oscillation , we must compare eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : a13 ] ) and ( [ eqn : a15 ] ) with quantum - mechanical calculations ( e.g. , a recursive green s function method  @xcite ) and also check the influence of the off - diagonal contribution to @xmath112  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is desirable to confirm our prediction by having recourse to a random matrix approach for systems with broken time reversal symmetries  @xcite .",
    "such investigations will be given elsewhere .",
    "in summary , we have derived the semiclassical formula for @xmath103 of single chaotic and regular ab billiards in which a weak @xmath0 is applied to the entire region .",
    "we have shown that @xmath2 oscillations and negative magnetoresistance would appear concurrently in @xmath103 : as for _ h/2e conductance oscillations _ , we find the oscillation mainly with a fundamental period @xmath17/2@xmath18 and rapid damping of the amplitude with increasing @xmath0 for the chaotic billiard versus the large contribution of higher harmonic components and mild damping of the oscillation amplitude for a regular billiard ; as for _ negative magnetoresistance _ , the lorentzian peak and saturation for the chaotic billiard versus a cusplike structure and no saturation for a regular billiard are reproduced .",
    "although taylor @xmath113 @xmath114  @xcite recently made an experimental study of the weak localization peak and self - similar structure of magnetoresistance in a semiconductor sinai billiard , no detailed experimental result of @xmath2 conductance oscillations has yet been reported .",
    "we hope that these characteristics of quantum chaos in the quantum magnetotransport will be experimentally observed in ballistic quantum dots forming ab geometry .",
