    "one of the biggest challenges in particle physics is to unravel the nature of the dimension five operator  @xcite responsible for generating the pattern of neutrino masses and mixings required to account for current oscillation experiments  @xcite . within the seesaw mechanism  @xcite",
    "this operator arises from the tree - level exchange of heavy messenger particles .",
    "for example , in the so - called type - i seesaw , these messengers are three 21 singlet right - handed neutrinos , which must be super - heavy in order to account for the observed smallness of neutrino masses . however , since singlets carry no gauge - anomaly , their number is theoretically unrestricted .",
    "such generalized type - i seesaw schemes  @xcite provide the theoretical basis for the formulation of the inverse seesaw  @xcite and the linear seesaw schemes  @xcite .",
    "both are capable of realizing the type - i seesaw mechanism at the tev scale and , as a result , these schemes open the possibility for novel phenomena such as    1 .",
    "lepton flavor and/or cp violating processes unsuppressed by neutrino masses  @xcite , 2 .",
    "effectively non - unitary lepton mixing matrix  @xcite leading to non - standard effects in neutrino propagation  @xcite .",
    "both features arise from the non - trivial structure of the electroweak currents in seesaw schemes  @xcite  .while their expected magnitude is negligible within the standard type - i seesaw , it can be sizeable in low - scale seesaw mechanisms .",
    "in this paper we analyse quantitatively the interplay between these two classes of processes .",
    "more precisely we define reference parameters describing the typical magnitude of non - standard neutrino propagation effects and compare them with the constraints which arise from the searches for lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) processes  @xcite .",
    "for definiteness we focus on two simple realizations of low - scale seesaw , namely the inverse and linear seesaw schemes .",
    "non - unitarity effects may also arise from the charged lepton sector  @xcite , leading also to lepton flavor violation .",
    "we find that unitarity violation effects in neutrino propagation at the percent level are consistent with the current bounds from lepton flavor violation searches .",
    "therefore their search at upcoming neutrino oscillation facilities  @xcite opens a window of opportunity to probe for new effects beyond the standard model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : high - low - scale ] we review the type - i seesaw mechanisms , first the high - scale and then the low - scale linear and inverse seesaw realizations , fixing the notation and giving general expressions for the unitarity violating parameters ; in section  [ sec : unit - viol - magn ] we study the analytical expressions relating lfv decay branching ratios with the non - standard pieces of the general seesaw lepton mixing matrix characterizing inverse and linear seesaw schemes ; in section  [ sec : numerical - analysis ] we describe the parameters used in our numerical analysis , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical - results ] we present our numerical results , both for normal and inverse neutrino mass hierarchies .",
    "finally we give our conclusions .",
    "the smallness of neutrino mass with respect to that of charged fermions can be naturally accounted for within the seesaw mechanism , in which the standard model is extended with extra 21 singlets  @xcite . in this case",
    "the resulting neutrino mass matrix in general is a @xmath1 matrix with @xmath2 .",
    "here we analyse the structure of this matrix in the high and low - scale type - i seesaw schemes .",
    "in general seesaw schemes the neutrino mass matrix @xmath3 can be decomposed in sub - blocks involving the standard as well as singlet neutrinos as follows @xmath4 in the basis @xmath5 , where the blocks @xmath6 and @xmath7 are symmetric matrices .",
    "though the number of singlets is arbitrary , here we take an equal number of su(2 ) doublets and singlets , and consider the simplest type - i seesaw , where no higgs triplet is present , so the upper left sub - matrix @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ type - i ] )  @xcite  .",
    "neutrino masses arise by diagonalizing the matrix of eq .",
    "( [ type - i ] ) , @xmath9 through the transformation @xmath10 connecting the weak states to the light and heavy mass eigenstates .",
    "we adopt a polar decomposition for @xmath10 where @xmath11 so we have a power series expansion for eq .",

    "( [ s - matrix ] ) in eq ( [ expansion ] ) we determine @xmath10 as : @xmath15 leading to an effective light neutrino mass matrix @xmath16 this is the so called type - i seesaw mechanism .",
    "the smallness of neutrino masses follows naturally from the heaviness of the @xmath17 singlet neutrino states @xmath18 .",
    "most seesaw descriptions assume equal number of doublets and singlets , @xmath19 .",
    "however , since singlets carry no gauge - anomaly , their number is arbitrary  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will consider not only the case @xmath20 just described , but also the inverse and linear seesaw schemes , which belong to the ( 3,6 ) class , see below .      as an alternative to the simplest 21 type - i seesaw model",
    ", it has long been proposed extending the seesaw lepton content from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , by adding three extra @xmath23 singlets  @xcite   @xmath24 charged under @xmath25 global lepton number the same way as the doublet neutrinos @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath26 . after electroweak symmetry breaking one gets the mass matrix @xmath27 in the basis @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where the three @xmath30 have @xmath31 .",
    "note that @xmath25 is broken only by the nonzero @xmath32 mass terms .",

    "@xcite already used in the previous section one finds that the mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ inverse ] ) can be block diagonalized as @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are @xmath37 matrices . in the limit @xmath38",
    "we have @xmath39 where @xmath40    with such matrix the light neutrino mass obtained after type - i seesaw is @xmath41 note that , in the limit as @xmath42 the lepton number symmetry is recovered , making the three light neutrinos strictly massless .",
    "thus the smallness of neutrino mass follows in a natural way , in the sense of t hooft @xcite , as it is protected by @xmath25 .",
    "one sees also that @xmath43 consists of a maximal block rotation , corresponding to the dirac nature of the three heavy leptons made - up of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the limit as @xmath42 , and two rotations similar to eq.([ui ] ) for the minimal type - i seesaw case considered in the previous section .",
    "note also that the idea behind the so - called _ inverse seesaw _ model can also be realized for other extended gauge groups e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , in specific models , the smallness of @xmath46 may be dynamically generated @xcite .",
    "an alternative seesaw scheme that can also be realized at low - scale is called the _ linear seesaw _ , and has been suggested as arising from a particular @xmath47 unified model  @xcite ( for other possible constructions see  @xcite ) .",
    "once the extended gauge structure breaks down to the standard 21 one gets a mass matrix of the type @xmath48 in the same basis @xmath49 used in sec .",
    "[ sec : inverse - seesaw ] .",
    "although theoretical consistency of the model requires extra ingredients , such as higgs scalars to generate the @xmath50 and @xmath51 entries , here we consider just the simpler phenomenological scheme defined by the effective mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) , as it suffices to describe the processes we are interested in .",
    "the block - diagonalization proceeds in a very similar way as to the inverse seesaw case , in fact , for sufficiently small @xmath52 the relations eq . ( [ u - bdiag ] ) and eq .  ( [ uap ] ) are the same in both schemes .",
    "one finds that the effective light neutrino mass is now given by @xmath53 one sees that , in contrast to the `` usual '' seesaw relations for the effective light neutrino mass , eqs .",

    "a result one sees that , in the limit as @xmath55 the lepton number symmetry is recovered , making the three light neutrinos strictly massless . again , as in the previous case , the smallness of neutrino mass follows in a natural way  @xcite , as it is protected by @xmath25 .",
    "the effective lepton mixing matrix @xmath56 characterizing the charged current weak interaction of mass - eigenstate neutrinos in any type of seesaw model has been fully characterized in ref .",
    "it can be expressed in rectangular form @xmath57 where @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the 3 by 3 unitary matrix that diagonalizes the charged lepton mass matrix , while @xmath10 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the ( higher - dimensional ) neutrino mass matrix characterizing the type - i seesaw mechanism of interest .",
    "we may write the @xmath60 matrix as follows @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a 3 by 3 matrix and @xmath63 is a 3 by 6 matrix . while the rows of the @xmath60 matrix are unit vectors , since @xmath64 , the blocks @xmath65 and @xmath63 are not unitary .",
    "for our purposes we can take the charged lepton mass matrix in diagonal form   so that @xmath66 . from eq .",

    "these parameters characterize the corresponding unitarity deviation in the light - active @xmath37 sub - block of the lepton mixing matrix .",
    "we now turn to the lepton flavor violating processes that would be induced at one loop in type - i seesaw models , as a result of the mixing of su(2 ) doublet neutrinos with singlet neutral heavy leptons .",
    "the latter breaks the glashow - illiopoulos - maiani cancellation mechanism  @xcite , enhancing the rates for the loop - induced lepton flavor violating processes illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ref : feynmangraphs ] .",
    "the @xmath74 decay process is induced through the exchange of the nine neutral leptons coupled to the charged leptons in the charged current , namely the three light neutrinos as well as the six sub - dominantly coupled heavy states  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : megbr ] for each case .",
    "the difference between the two models follows from the different dependence with the lepton number violating parameters that characterize these two low - energy type - i seesaw realizations .     versus the lepton",

    "this reflects an important feature of low - scale seesaw models , namely , that lepton flavor violation as well as leptonic cp violation proceed even in the limit of massless neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "unsuppressed by the smallness of neutrino mass , the expected rates are sizeable .",
    "the corresponding radiative lfv decays @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not as constraining as @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , the fact that the neutral current couplings of charged leptons is flavor diagonal implies that the decay processes @xmath82 are suppressed by a factor of @xmath83 with respect to the radiative processes , hence less restrictive .",
    "another very important lepton flavor violating process is mu - e conversion in nuclei , which arises both from short range ( non - photonic ) as well as long range ( photonic ) contributions .",
    "explicit calculations  @xcite indicate that , given the nuclear form factors , one finds that current mu - e conversion sensitivities are effectively lower than those of the @xmath84 decay .",
    "however the upcoming generation of nuclear conversion experiments aims at substantial improvement .",
    "in order to perform our numerical calculations it is convenient to generalize the casas - ibarra parametrization  @xcite to the inverse and linear type - i seesaw schemes . for simplicity",
    "we will assume real lepton yukawa couplings and mass entries .",
    "first note that one has always the freedom to go to the basis where the @xmath37 gauge - singlet block @xmath85 is taken diagonal . for real @xmath86 matrix elements , we have in total @xmath87 parameters , nine characterizing @xmath86 , three characterizing @xmath85 , plus six from the @xmath46 matrix",

    "the arbitrary real orthogonal @xmath37 matrix @xmath91 and the arbitrary @xmath37 real matrix @xmath85 are parameters characterizing the model .",
    "this parametrization for the inverse type - i seesaw is similar to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to further reduce the number of degrees of freedom",
    ", we will make the `` minimal flavor violation hypothesis ''   which consists in assuming that flavor is violated only in the `` standard '' dirac yukawa coupling . under this simplification",
    "the @xmath37 matrix @xmath46 must be also diagonal , reducing the parameter count from a total of @xmath87 down to @xmath92 .",
    "these include the three light neutrino masses , and the three neutrino mixing angles contained in @xmath89 .",
    "next come the nine model - defining parameters , that may be taken as three parameters from the @xmath91 matrix , three from the @xmath46 matrix , plus three parameters characterizing @xmath85 .",
    "we have performed a scan at @xmath93 over the lightest mass and oscillation parameters , the three angles and the three masses in @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively . for the scan over oscillation parameters we have used the @xmath93 determinations given in  @xcite , and for the lightest mass parameter we took the cosmological bound from @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the real orthogonal matrix @xmath91 as a product of three rotations , marginalizing over the three angles from @xmath94 values .",
    "we have also fixed the upper value of the dirac mass matrix to @xmath95 to be consistent with perturbativity of the theory .",

    "one can always go to a basis where one of them is diagonal , for example @xmath50 , reducing the total number of model parameters to 21 .    in order to further reduce the number of degrees of freedom ,",
    "we make a similar `` minimal flavor violation hypothesis '' to this scheme too , namely , we choose the @xmath85 matrix also to be diagonal , reducing from 21 to 15 parameters .",
