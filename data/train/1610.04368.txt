    "in this work , we will classify the semisimple cohomological field theories ( cohft ) , following teleman s 2011 article @xcite .",
    "a cohomological field theory is the datum of a finite dimensional @xmath2-vector space @xmath3 with a nondegenerate bilinear form @xmath4 on it , a nonzero vector @xmath5 , and for every @xmath6 and @xmath7 with @xmath8 , a @xmath2-linear homomorphism @xmath9 satisfying certain axioms related to the geometrical structure of @xmath0 ( the moduli space of stable complex projective curves with @xmath7 marked points ) , namely the presence of a natural @xmath10-action , of sewing maps and of the forgetful map @xmath11 .",
    "more details will be given in section 3 .",
    "we define a frobenius algebra structure on @xmath3 by imposing @xmath12 , so we get @xmath13 as the neutral element for the multiplication .",
    "this algebra is said to be _ semisimple _ if there exists an orthonormal basis @xmath14 for @xmath4 made of projectors , that is elements such that @xmath15 for some nonzero complex numbers @xmath16 and @xmath17 for @xmath18 ; in this case the cohft is said to be semisimple .",
    "the classification will be restricted to this type of theories .",
    "one property of semisimple frobenius algebras , that will be used in a crucial way , is that the element @xmath19 , called the _",
    "euler class _ of the algebra , is invertible .",
    "the classification will be carried out in three steps .",
    "first of all , we will consider the space @xmath20 which is the @xmath7-torus bundle over @xmath1 corresponding to assigning a tangent direction to the curve at each marked point , and we define @xmath21 with the same axioms of a cohomological field theory , properly modified with a deformation of the sewing maps so to always have smooth curves .",
    "these theories are called _ fixed boundary theories _ and can be easily classified thanks to several fundamental results concerning the cohomology of the smooth part @xmath1 , namely harer s stability theorem for @xmath22 , its extension to @xmath1 by looijenga , and madsen - weiss s theorem ( former mumford s conjecture ) about the stable cohomology of @xmath22 .",
    "we will see that the answer for the first step is given by a homomorphism @xmath23_{j\\ge 1}$ ] of the form @xmath24 where the @xmath25 are freely chosen co - vectors , and the @xmath26 s are the @xmath27-classes on the moduli space . for every choice of the @xmath28 s we have a theory by setting @xmath29 .",
    "the second step deals with cohfts on @xmath1 , again with axioms slightly modified to always have smooth curves .",
    "these are called _ free boundary theories _ and in this case we get the classification by pulling back to @xmath20 ( this procedure yields indeed a fixed boundary theory ) and using the result of the first step . the classification in this case is given by a fixed boundary theory and a @xmath30-valued endomorphism @xmath31 $ ] with @xmath32 , satisfying the _ symplectic condition _ @xmath33 and such that @xmath34 the quantities involved are defined in section 6.2 .    under these conditions ,",
    "the theory is given by @xmath35 where the @xmath36 are the @xmath30-classes at the marked points .",
    "the last step is to get the full theories on @xmath0 , also called deligne - mumford theories or nodal theories .",
    "the fact that for every smooth theory @xmath37 there is a nodal theory @xmath0 that restricts to @xmath37 on the smooth part @xmath1 will be an easy consequence of givental s group action .",
    "however , the fact that this nodal theory is _ unique _ is not trivial at all . to show it , a new stratification of @xmath0 is introduced .",
    "this work has been written on spring 2015 as a master s thesis at the universit pierre et marie curie ( paris vi ) under the supervision of dimitri zvonkine : i would like to thank him for his infinite patience and for having taught me all i know about this subject and about how to write a paper .",
    "i also thank the jury members alessandro chiodo and julien march .",
    "i thank alessandro chiodo for very useful discussions and support about my future as a phd student .",
    "i would also like to thank the ens for having provided the funds and the resources that have allowed me to complete my career as a master student .",
    "we collect in this section all the basic notions that will be assumed throughout the paper .",
    "this is just an expository section and contains no proofs .",

    "a a riemann surface @xmath38 with @xmath7 distinct marked points @xmath39 is _ stable _ if there is only a finite number of automorphisms of @xmath38 that leave all the points @xmath40 fixed .",
    "it can be shown that a riemann surface of genus @xmath6 with @xmath7 marked point is stable if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath1 to denote the coarse moduli space of stable riemann surfaces of genus @xmath6 and @xmath7 marked points ; roughly speaking , it is the class of all stable riemann surfaces of genus @xmath6 with @xmath7 marked points , modulo isomorphism .",
    "for example , @xmath41 consists of just one point : any riemann surface of genus @xmath42 is isomorphic to @xmath43 , and for any two sets consisting each of three distinct points , there is an automorphism of @xmath43 that sends one set into the other one .",
    "we will denote by @xmath44 a stable curve , where @xmath38 is a riemann surface of genus @xmath6 and @xmath45 .",
    "the space @xmath1 exists only in the case that @xmath46 ; in this case , its complex dimension is @xmath47 .",
    "we will write @xmath0 for the the _ deligne - mumford compactification _ of @xmath1 .",
    "it is a compact orbifold that has @xmath1 as an open dense suborbifold .",
    "the elements of @xmath0 are called _ stable curves _ of genus @xmath6 with @xmath7 marked points .",
    "it can be shown that any stable curve is a connected nodal curve , with only simple nodes .",
    "for @xmath48 a nodal curve of geometric genus @xmath6 with only simple nodes and @xmath7 marked points distinct from the nodes , let @xmath49 be its normalization .",
    "then each node @xmath50 has two pre - images @xmath51 and @xmath52 on @xmath53 , while each marked point @xmath40 has one pre - image @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath55 where the @xmath56 s are the irreducible components of @xmath38 , we have a corresponding decomposition @xmath57 into _ connected _ smooth components , and for each @xmath58 we have @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath48 be a connected nodal curve with only simple nodes which are distinct from the marked points , let @xmath60 be the set of its nodes , and @xmath61 be the set of its marked points .",
    "each component @xmath62 has natural markings , namely the @xmath63 points of @xmath64 and the @xmath65 points of @xmath66 .",
    "then @xmath48 is stable ( that is , it belongs to @xmath0 ) if and only if every @xmath67 is a stable riemann surface , that is , it belongs to @xmath68 for some @xmath69 and @xmath70 such that @xmath71 . a point which is either a node or a marked point",
    "is called a _",
    "special point_.    if @xmath72 and @xmath73 , let @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the equivalence relation in which @xmath76 and all the other points are identified with nothing but themselves .",
    "then @xmath77 is a nodal curve and it can be easily shown that @xmath78 is in fact a stable curve of genus @xmath79 with @xmath80 marked points .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 induces a continuous map @xmath82 which we will call the _ separating sewing map _ , and the operation of taking @xmath81 will be also described as sewing the curves in @xmath83 with those in @xmath84 along the points marked @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively .",
    "notice that @xmath81 is an injective map .",
    "analogously , if @xmath87 , let @xmath88 where @xmath75 is the equivalence relation in which @xmath89 and all the other points are identified with nothing but themselves .",
    "then @xmath90 is a nodal curve and it can be easily shown that @xmath91 is in fact a stable curve of genus @xmath6 with @xmath7 marked points .",
    "therefore , @xmath92 induces a continuous map @xmath93 which we will call the _ non - separating sewing map_. notice that @xmath92 is a @xmath94-fold covering map on its image .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath8 and let @xmath95 . if the curve @xmath48 obtained by cancelling the last marked point is stable , we define it to be @xmath96 . however , @xmath48 can also be not stable .",
    "this happens if the last marked point lies on an irreducible component that has genus zero and only three special points .",
    "if this is the case , we call the _ stabilization _ of @xmath48 the curve obtained by contracting the whole non - stable component to a point .",
    "we define this stabilization to be @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , @xmath98 induces a continuous map @xmath99 called the _ forgetful map _ , and the operation of taking @xmath98 will be also described as forgetting the last marked point .",
    "notice that @xmath98 is a proper map and it is surjective .",
    "we denote by @xmath100 the cohomology with complex coefficients of @xmath0 considered just as a topological space .",
    "we use a similar notation for @xmath1 .    for each @xmath101 ,",
    "let @xmath102 be the cotangent space to @xmath38 at @xmath40 .",
    "assigning this object to each curve of @xmath0 defines a line bundle @xmath103 which we will call , by abuse of language , the cotangent bundle at the @xmath58-th marked point .",
    "its chern class is denoted by @xmath104 and we will call it the @xmath30-class at the @xmath58-th marked point .",
    "let us consider the forgetful map @xmath105 . since it is a proper map , the push - forward @xmath106 is well - defined .",
    "we define @xmath107 and we will call it the @xmath108-th @xmath27-class .      let us fix an element @xmath109 , and let @xmath110 be the set of curves which are diffeomorphic to @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath111 is , by definition , the _ open boundary stratum _ corresponding to the topological type of @xmath38 .",
    "the topological closure @xmath112 of an open boudary stratum is called a _ closed boundary stratum_.    if @xmath38 is a smooth curve , we get @xmath113 , therefore @xmath1 is an open boundary stratum , and we will call it the _ smooth stratum _ of @xmath0 . by contrast , the complementary @xmath114 is called the _ boundary _ of @xmath0 .",
    "except for the smooth stratum , every open or closed boundary stratum is a subset of the boudary @xmath115 ( this justifies the term boundary stratum ) . notice that , while a closed boundary stratum is obviously a closed subset of @xmath0 , an open boundary stratum which is not the smooth stratum is _ never _ an open subset of @xmath0 .",
    "it can be shown that open boundary strata are smooth suborbifolds of @xmath0 , meaning that they have no self intersections .",
    "let @xmath109 and let @xmath49 be its normalization , with @xmath116 the connected components , and let @xmath117 .",
    "then it is clear ( one can prove it by induction on @xmath118 ) that @xmath119 is simply a sequence of @xmath81 and @xmath92 maps that can be taken , without loss of generality , in order : @xmath120 since each @xmath121 is injective and each @xmath122 is a covering map , we see that the sequence written above induces a covering map from @xmath123 to @xmath111 ; let @xmath124 be the monodromy group of this covering",
    ". then we have @xmath125 therefore we also get @xmath126 . from this description , it is clear that the correspondence @xmath127 is a bijection between the open and the closed boundary strata .",

    "then it can be shown that @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are , respectively , the tangent bundles at the marked points @xmath134 and @xmath135 . therefore , by definition of @xmath30-classes , its chern class is @xmath136      the _ stable range _ of the cohomology of @xmath0 is the part of @xmath100 of degree at most @xmath137 ( unless when the converse is clear , all degrees , as long as dimensions and codimensions , are intended as complex ) .",
