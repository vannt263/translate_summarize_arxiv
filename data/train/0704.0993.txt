    "in a classical paper @xcite eardley and moncrief proved that solutions of the yang - mills equations on the @xmath1 minkowski spacetime starting from smooth initial data remain smooth for all future times . a different proof allowing for initial data with only finite energy",
    "was given later by klainerman and machedon @xcite .",
    "once global regularity was established , the problem of asymptotic behavior of solutions for @xmath2 was studied by many authors @xcite who obtained various decay estimates using different techniques and assumptions about initial data . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the simplest possible situation , namely spherically symmetric initial data with compact support . in this case",
    "it follows from the conformal method of christodoulou that the yang - mills curvature decays as @xmath0 at timelike infinity @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is threefold .",
    "first , we rederive christodoulou s result using the nonlinear perturbation theory .",
    "the advantage of our approach lies in its wide applicability ; in contrast to the conformal method which is very powerful ( in the sense of giving sharp decay rates ) only for conformally invariant equations .",
    "second , we go beyond qualitative decay estimates and give the third - order formula for the amplitude of solution which provides a precise _ quantitative _ information about the tail .",
    "we wish to point out that although our result depends crucially on spherical symmetry , the assumption of compact support for initial data is made for simplicity and can be relaxed by imposing a suitable fall - off condition at spatial infinity ( which can be implemented via appropriately weighted norms ) . however , some kind of localization condition is necessary in order to avoid a situation where the tail in time is induced entirely by the tail of initial data at spatial infinity ( due , for instance , to nonzero charge ) .",
    "third , we argue that the same tail is present in the scattering of spherically symmetric yang - mills fields off the schwarzschild black hole . in this case",
    "the global existence of solutions follows from the work of chruciel and shatah @xcite who generalized the proof of eardley and moncrief to arbitrary globally hyperbolic lorentzian 4-manifolds .",
    "the late - time tail of the yang - mills field on the schwarzschild background was studied in @xcite , however the fall - off @xmath3 derived there on the basis of the linear perturbation analysis is not correct . as we shall see , the error in @xcite is due to the fact that the late - time tail is _ not _ governed by the linearized evolution . at first sight that might seem odd but upon reflection",
    "it is easy to understand .",
    "a rough intuitive explanation is that the tail is a far - field effect hence the flat space tail @xmath0 is expected to persist in any asymptotically flat spacetime as long as the backscattering on the curvature does not produce a more slowly decaying tail .",
    "a similar example of the failure of linear perturbation analysis was recently observed in the scattering of skyrmions @xcite .",
    "we consider the yang - mills theory with the gauge group @xmath4 and assume the spherically symmetric ansatz for the connection @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the usual generators of @xmath9 .",
    "the yang - mills equations @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the yang - mills curvature , reduce then to the semilinear radial wave equation @xmath12 where primes and dots denote derivatives with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . for our purposes",
    "it is convenient to define the function @xmath15 and rewrite equation ( [ eqw ] ) in the following form @xmath16 note that @xmath17 is the radial wave operator for the @xmath18 spherical harmonic .",
    "we consider the late - time evolution of solutions of equation ( [ ym ] ) for smooth compactly supported initial data @xmath19 the prefactor @xmath20 is added for convenience and to emphasize that our initial data are assumed to be small .",
    "regularity at the origin is ensured by the boundary condition @xmath21 for @xmath22 . as follows from @xcite such solutions decay to zero on any compact region of space as @xmath23 . to determine the asymptotic behavior of solutions we define the perturbative expansion @xmath24 where @xmath25 satisfies initial data ( [ i d ] ) and all @xmath26 with @xmath27 have zero initial data . substituting the expansion ( [ pert ] ) into equation ( [ ym ] ) up to the third order we get",
    "@xmath28 we solve these equations recursively .",
    "the first order solution is given by the general regular solution of the free radial wave equation for the @xmath18 spherical harmonic @xmath29 where the function @xmath30 is determined by the initial data @xmath31 for compactly supported initial data the function @xmath30 has compact support as well ( note that the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 in ( [ a ] ) are odd extensions of initial data to the whole line ) , hence @xmath34 has no tail in agreement with huygens principle .",
    "to solve equations for the higher order perturbations we use the retarded green s function of the operator @xmath17 @xmath35 \\ , \\frac{r^2+{r'}^2-(t - t')^2}{4      r^2}\\,.\\ ] ]",
    "it follows from ( [ green ] ) that the solution of the inhomogeneous equation @xmath36 with zero initial data has the form ( using null coordinates @xmath37 ) @xcite @xmath38 where the kernel @xmath39 . in the second order , i.e. for equation ( [ f2p ] ) , the representation ( [ duh2 ] ) yields @xmath40 somewhat surprisingly , huygens property is preserved in the second order . to see this ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "then , for @xmath43 we may change the order of integration in ( [ eqf2 ] ) and rewrite it as ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath44 performing the inner integral we get @xmath45 which after integration gives zero .",
    "thus , @xmath46 vanishes identically for @xmath43 and consequently there is no tail up to the second order .        in the third order ,",
    "i.e. for equation ( [ f3p ] ) , the representation ( [ duh2 ] ) gives @xmath47 , where @xmath48 to calculate @xmath49 for @xmath43 , as above we change the order of integration and perform the integral over @xmath50 with the result ( using the abbreviation @xmath51 ) @xmath52 which has the following asymptotic behavior near timelike infinity ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) @xmath55 in the formula above we replaced @xmath56 by @xmath57 in the limits of integration to emphasize that the result holds not only for strictly compactly supported initial data but also for initial data which fall off sufficiently fast at spatial infinity .    to calculate the contribution to the tail coming from @xmath58 we need to know both the leading and the subleading terms in the asymptotic expansion of @xmath59 near null infinity ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) .",
    "this calculation is deferred to the appendix where we show that near null infinity @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined by ( [ h ] ) and ( [ g ] ) , respectively .",
    "note that the first two terms in ( [ f2nul ] ) represent the `` free '' part of the iterate @xmath46 ; as we shall see in a moment this part does _ not _ affect the behavior of @xmath58 at timelike infinity . substituting ( [ f2nul ] ) into ( [ eqf32 ] ) and proceeding along the same lines as in the derivation of the expression ( [ tail1 ] ) we obtain the following asymptotic behavior near timelike infinity @xmath65 du = -12     \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } a(u ) a'(u)^2 du\\,,\\ ] ] where the last expression follows from ( [ g ] ) and integration by parts .",
    "putting equations ( [ tail1 ] ) and ( [ tail2 ] ) together we finally get the leading asymptotic behavior near timelike infinity @xmath66 this is our main result .",
    "we claim that the expression ( [ tail ] ) provides a very good approximation of the tail for solutions having sufficiently small initial data .",
    "more precisely , we conjecture that for any given smooth compactly supported functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 one can choose @xmath20 such that for each fixed @xmath69 and @xmath23 the remainder @xmath70 is as small as one pleases . the numerical evidence supporting this conjecture is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the obvious issue remains as to whether the perturbation expansion corresponding to given initial data is convergent for sufficiently small values of @xmath20 . without a proof of convergence",
    "our analysis is not mathematically rigorous , nevertheless we believe that it gives a rather convincing and , most importantly , _ quantitative _ description of the late - time tail .",
    "0.2 cm a few remarks are in order : 0.2 cm _ remark  1 : _",
    "it should be clear from the above derivation that the simplicity of the final result ( [ tail ] ) is due to some amazing cancelations ( notably those occurring in equations ( [ f2as ] ) and ( [ tail2 ] ) ) which in turn are attributed to the particular form of the nonlinearity of the yang - mills equations . in this respect",
    "the yang - mills equations are exceptional and particularly interesting mathematically ; for most other nonlinear perturbations of the wave equation the tail is a second - order phenomenon which is much easier to analyze ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "remark  2 : _ note that all iterates @xmath71 behave as @xmath72 $ ] near null infinity and therefore at each order of the perturbation expansion the sources behave as @xmath73 $ ] . for such sources one might expect by dimensional arguments that there would be a @xmath74 tail .",
    "fortunately , due to the identity @xmath75 all coefficients of hypothetical @xmath74 tails vanish identically and thus all higher - order terms in the perturbation expansion decay as @xmath0 .",
    "this fact is crucial since otherwise the third - order approximation would break down for late times ; for instance a nonzero fourth - order term @xmath76 would make the formula ( [ tail ] ) useless for times @xmath77 .",
    "remark  3 : _ note that equation ( [ ym ] ) has the scaling symmetry : if @xmath78 is a solution , so is @xmath79 . under this scaling the energy scales as @xmath80 , hence given any finite energy initial datum one can scale it down to an arbitrarily small amplitude and energy .",
    "note , however , that for compactly supported initial data such a rescaling spreads the support by a factor @xmath81 and for this reason it can not make large data smaller in the sense of our perturbation expansion .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that all iterates @xmath82 in ( [ pert ] ) scale in the same way . in other words ,",
    "the rescaling does not change the convergence properties of the perturbation expansion .",
    "on the exterior schwarzschild spacetime @xmath83 the spherically symmetric yang - mills equation corresponding to the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) takes the form @xmath84 when @xmath85 this equation reduces of course to ( [ eqw ] ) . in terms of the new variables",
    "@xmath86 equation ( [ eqwsch ] ) becomes @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "dropping the nonlinear terms on the right side of ( [ eqwx ] ) one gets the linear @xmath89 dimensional wave equation on the real axis @xmath90 with the effective potential @xmath91 .",
    "this equation describes the propagation of the dipole ( @xmath18 ) electromagnetic perturbation of the schwarzschild black hole . for _ intermediate",
    "_ times the linearized approximation is very good ; this stage of evolution has the form of exponentially damped oscillations dominated by the fundamental ( i.e. , least damped ) quasinormal mode .",
    "we recall that quasinormal modes are solutions of the linearized equation satisfying the outgoing wave conditions @xmath92 for @xmath93 . in the case at hand",
    "the fundamental quasinormal mode has the eigenvalue @xmath94 ( in units where @xmath95 ) @xcite .",
    "the quasinormal mode decays exponentially so for late times it becomes negligible and eventually a polynomial tail is uncovered .",
    "since the pioneering work of price @xcite it has been known that the tail of the @xmath96-th multipole decays as @xmath97 , thus for the dipole the linearized theory predicts the tail @xmath3 and this is exactly the result derived in @xcite .",
    "we claim that this prediction is incorrect and the actual tail behaves in the same manner as in minkowski spacetime , namely it decays as @xmath0 . regarding equation ( [ eqwsch ] ) as the perturbation ( for @xmath98 ) of equation ( [ eqw ] ) , one can see from dimensional considerations that the failure of linearization is due to the fact that the linear terms in ( [ eqwsch ] ) corresponding to nonzero curvature ( proportional to @xmath99 ) are of _ shorter range _ ( using pde jargon ) than the nonlinear terms .",
    "thus , the presence of the black hole should not alter the flat space tail @xmath0 .",
    "the numerical substantiation of this handwaving argument is shown in fig .  3 .",
    "unfortunately , for the schwarzschild background we were not able to derive a quantitative formula , analogous to ( [ tail ] ) , relating the amplitude of the tail to initial data .",
    "an attempt to repeat the perturbation analysis from section  ii encounters serious difficulties on schwarzschild background which are caused by the violation of huygens principle in @xmath89 dimensions and the presence of the potential . it would be interesting to pursue this problem further , perhaps borrowing ideas from an approach proposed some time ago by barack @xcite .",
    "although barack considered only the linear wave equation , we wish to emphasize that there are many similarities between his work and our analysis in section  ii .",
    "using third order nonlinear perturbation theory we determined the late - time tail of spherically symmetric yang - mills equations on minkowski background .",
    "we also gave heuristic arguments that the same tail is present on schwarzschild background .",
    "in both cases we provided numerical evidence supporting our results . we hope that our approach will trigger more rigorous mathematical analyses of these physically important phenomena .",
    "we remark that the ideas presented here can be applied to other nonlinear wave equations . for example",
    ", one can show by similar methods that for the semilinear wave equation @xmath100 on minkowski background the tail decays as @xmath101 for @xmath102 , while on the schwarzschild background the tail changes its character at @xmath103 from linear ( price s law @xmath104 for @xmath105 @xcite ) to nonlinear ( @xmath106 for @xmath107 ) .",
    "a systematic analysis of the competition between linear and nonlinear effects in scattering for semilinear wave equations in minkowski spacetime will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
