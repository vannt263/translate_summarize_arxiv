    "pairs of high frequencies , known as kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) , have been detected in the x - ray emission of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) for more than 20 neutron stars and several black holes .",
    "it has been suggested that a non - linear resonance within an accretion disc in a general - relativistic space - time metric plays a role in the excitation of the two oscillations ( abramowicz & kluniak 2001 , kluniak & abramowicz 2001 ) .",
    "it is now recognized that the frequencies of the two peaks in the power spectrum of x - ray variability in black holes are in rational ratios , @xmath1 , with @xmath2 for two sources , and @xmath3 in a third source ( abramowicz & kluniak 2001 ; kluniak & abramowicz 2002 ; remillard et al .",
    "2002 , abramowicz et al .",
    "these black hole qpos are thought to have stable frequencies , and until the discovery of the puzzling rational ratios they have been thought to correspond to a trapped g - mode or c - mode of disc oscillation in the kerr metric ( okazaki et al .",
    "1987 , wagoner 1999 , wagoner et al .",
    "2001 , kato 2001 ) .    in neutron star sources ,",
    "the twin khz qpo frequencies are known to vary considerably and to be mutually correlated . in the context of disc oscillations , two frequencies varying in this fashion",
    "can be explained as the fundamental and the first harmonic of the non - axisymmetric ( _ m_=1 ) g - mode ( kato 2002 , 2003 ) . in sco x-1 , a prototypical z - source ,",
    "the slope of the correlation line is somewhat steeper than 2/3 , but it is not uncommon to find the source in a state when @xmath4  hz , and @xmath5  hz , i.e. , at about @xmath0 ratio ( abramowicz et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "it would appear that the @xmath0 frequency ratio is common to neutron star and black hole systems .",
    "kluniak & abramowicz ( 2002 ) , and abramowicz & kluniak ( 2003 ) suggest that the @xmath0 ratio follows from the properties of parametric resonance between two eigenfrequencies , of which one is always lower than the other . specifically , two modes of disc oscillation are thought possible with frequencies close to the two epicyclic frequencies of free orbital motion . within general relativity ,",
    "the radial epicyclic frequency is generically lower than the meridional one , their ratio varying from one to zero as the radius of circular orbits decreases from infinity down to that of the marginally stable orbit .",
    "the observed rational ratios of frequencies may follow from fundamental properties of both strong gravity and a non - linear resonance between radial and vertical oscillations in accretion discs with fluid lines that are nearly geodesic , nearly circular , and nearly planar . in this paper",
    "we investigate a simple mathematical model of such motions . to this aim",
    ", we discuss the properties of parametric resonance in the paczyski - wiita ( 1980 ) model of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "let us consider a fluid in which the flow lines are only slightly non - circular , and slightly off the @xmath6 symmetry plane .",
    "in spherical coordinates , @xmath7 with accuracy to the third order in @xmath8 and @xmath9 , equations of fluid motion read : @xmath10\\delta \\theta\\ ] ] @xmath11    @xmath12 @xmath13    @xmath14    here the time derivative is denoted by a dot , the radial derivative by a prime , and @xmath15 are components of a small force of non - gravitational origin ( pressure , viscous , magnetic , or other ) . the epicyclic eigenfrequencies @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined , in terms of the effective potential @xmath18 and the specific angular momentum @xmath19 , by    @xmath20    derivation of these equations assumes equatorial plane symmetry for the gravitational potential @xmath21 . here",

    "( 0.48,48)obr3as.eps ( 0.48,48)obr3b.eps",

    "let us consider a simplified version of eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6a])([2.6c ] ) , with @xmath31 , and some of the higher order terms neglected . with accuracy up to linear terms in ( [ 2.6b ] )",
    "one obtains , obviously , a solution @xmath32 . substituting this solution in ( [ 2.6a ] ) brings this equation close to the standard form ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we have solved these equations for @xmath33 , with @xmath30 a positive real parameter .",
    "the instability regions for a lower - order version of equations ( [ 2.6a])([2.6b ] ) resemble the well - known tongues of instability of the mathieu equation . since @xmath34 in general relativity , the lowest value for which the resonance can occur is @xmath35 , and the first two tongues of instability in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] will be absent ; i.e. , the ratio of the two eigenfrequencies in ( [ 8 ] ) is @xmath0 for the strongest resonance ( kluniak & abramowicz 2002 ) .",
    "however , the behaviour of the resonance can only be properly studied if the third - order terms in ( [ 2.6a ] ) and the second - order terms in ( [ 2.6b ] ) are retained .",
    "these terms provide the non - linearity necessary to saturate the amplitude at a finite value and the damping which affects the frequency of oscillations . using the standard analytic method of successive approximations ( landau & lifshitz 1976 )",
    ", we verified that , as expected , no parametric resonance occurs for strictly geodesic motion , i.e. , for @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6a])([2.6c ] ) .",
    "we also checked numerically that there is no resonance in the geodesic case .",
    "however , the resonance does occur ( as anticipated in kluniak & abramowicz 2002 ) for even very slightly non - geodesic motion , when the higher order terms are influenced by non - geodesic effects of a rather general form and right amplitude .",
    "in general it is not possible to specify the form of the very small force @xmath15 exactly , because the nature of non - geodesic forces in accretion discs is not yet very accurately known . here",
    ", we only explore the basic mathematical form of the solutions , not the physical origin of the @xmath15 force .",
    "we assume _ ad hoc _ that the possible non - geodesic effects have the form of a non - linear isotropic coupling between the two components of geodesic deviation : @xmath37 \\delta \\theta , \\label{9}\\ ] ] @xmath38    r { \\left(\\dot{\\delta\\theta}\\right)^2}.   \\label{10}\\ ] ] here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 measure the strength of non - geodesic forces in comparison with the geodesic terms of corresponding form and order .",
    "we first assumed @xmath41 for the sake of simplicity .    after choosing a particular value of @xmath42 , we solved eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6a])([2.6b ] ) numerically by using the runge - kutta adaptive step - size routine .",
    "the integration was performed over a wide range of starting radii , @xmath43 . for the initial conditions",
    ", we took @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "we then repeated the same procedure for another value of @xmath42 , and in this way we constructed a sequence of solutions that is parameterized by @xmath42 and @xmath48 .",
    "one can locate radii @xmath49 for which @xmath50 grows in time up to a maximum amplitude .",
    "the saturation amplitude , @xmath51 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right panel ) as a function of radius . clearly",
    ", the largest amplitudes correspond to parametric resonance .",
    "close to those radii the test - particle epicyclic frequencies are in rational ratios @xmath52 ; @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "note that the growth rate of the amplitudes @xmath56 , @xmath57 decreases with decreasing @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath0 resonance is the strongest one , as expected .    the exact slope of the @xmath0 resonance trace @xmath49 , starting from the point @xmath58 , depends on the choice of coupling parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ 9])([10 ] ) , so the above assumption of identical values for @xmath59 is not universal . for example",
    ", assuming @xmath60 and setting @xmath61 , one finds that the end of the trace is moved to the point @xmath62 .",
    "it is thus shifted in the @xmath63-plane with respect to the case @xmath64 , for which the trace ends at the point @xmath65 , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "also the initial conditions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 have an influence on the trace slope .",
    "therefore , the corresponding frequencies that are present in the solutions for @xmath68 , @xmath69 depend on the details of the solution .",
    "nevertheless , the ratio of the frequencies stays at @xmath0 at the maximum amplitude .",
    "this fact is in agreement with the intuition about the properties of eqs .",
    "( [ 2.6a])([2.6b ] ) , and we checked it by fourier - analyzing their solution .",
    "in this paper we assumed the gravitational potential of eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) for the sake of simplicity .",
    "when a more accurate , full formulation in general relativity is developed together with a physical mechanism responsible for the non - geodesic coupling term ( [ 9])([10 ] ) , one will be able to constrain the absolute value of the mass of the accreting body .",
    "as noted in section  1 , the frequency ratio of the qpos in some black hole sources is accurately @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , in gro j1655 - 40 the frequency ratio is that of 300  hz and 450  hz , while in xte j1550 - 564 it is that of 184 hz and 276 hz ( abramowicz & kluniak 2001 , remillard et al .",
    "the properties of parametric resonance , discussed above , provide a natural explanation for this ratio .",
    "( 0.48,0.5)obr4.eps    can the same mechanism be responsible for the observed frequencies of the khz qpos in neutron stars ?",
    "in neutron star sources the two khz qpos vary considerably in frequency , and their ratio is not always @xmath0 .",
    "a case in point is sco x-1 , whose two khz frequencies are linearly correlated ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , but not directly proportional to each other ( van der klis et al .  1997 ) .",
    "however , the distribution of points along the line of correlation is not uniform , and the resulting distribution of frequency ratios has a prominent peak at about @xmath0 value , strongly suggesting the presence of a non - linear resonance ( abramowicz et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "we note that qpos are not coherent oscillations , and that the typical integration time ( minutes ) greatly exceeds the coherence time of the signal ( fraction of a second ) .",
    "we find that the slope of sco x-1 frequency correlation can be reproduced if we assume that the signal observed at a given time corresponds to the frequencies originating at a particular radius , for example the radius @xmath49 discussed in the previous section .",
    "if this is _ not _ strictly equal to the radius where the maximum amplitude is attained , the ratio of the frequencies departs from 2/3 .",
    "specifically , taking an arbitrary initial amplitude @xmath70 we constructed fourier power spectra of @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "these power spectra peak at frequencies @xmath73 and @xmath74 , which we interpret here as the observed pair of oscillations .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the correlation between @xmath75 and @xmath76 along the @xmath42-trace from fig .",
    "we assumed @xmath64 as before .",
    "the actual value of @xmath70 has been selected to match the slope of sco x-1 data ( van der klis 1997 ) . because @xmath42 measures the deviation from geodesicity , its value is likely to be a function of the accretion rate in the disc , @xmath77 .",
    "this notion agrees with the reported correlation between the frequencies and the position of the source along the z curve in the color - color diagram .",
    "[ fig4 ] illustrates that the simple scheme that we introduced in the present paper may , indeed , explain the slope of @xmath78 relation .",
    "we have expanded , through the third order , relativistic equations of test motion about a circular geodesic , and have shown that the lowest order expansion corresponds to mathieu s equation with non - standard damping . as expected , the solutions of these ( unperturbed ) equations do not show any resonant phenomenon  they simply describe geodesic motion .",
    "when a sufficiently large non - geodesic perturbation is imposed , the deviations grow rapidly at certain resonant radii and the motion departs from circular geodesics .",
    "this is caused by parametric resonance between the meridional and radial epicyclic motions , and the strongest resonance occurs when the two dominant frequencies are near ratio @xmath0 .",
    "we thank michiel van der klis for providing the sco x-1 data and for a very helpful discussion .",
