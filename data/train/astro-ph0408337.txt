    "among @xmath2 source populations , lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) dominate in sheer numbers of objects with spectroscopic redshifts @xcite . as a result",
    ", they define a natural test set for galaxy evolution models ( e.g. , baugh et al .",
    "1998 ; mo , mao , & white 1999 ; somerville , primack , & faber 2001 ) .",
    "different authors have reached different conclusions about the nature of star formation in lbgs .",
    "the population s strong bias relative to the underlying dark matter fluctuations @xcite , at a level apparently correlated with rest - uv luminosity @xcite , argues that lbgs are forming spheroids at the centers of the most massive @xmath3 halos .",
    "in contrast , a high close pair fraction suggests that the most massive halos host more than one lbg ( wechsler et al .",
    "2001 ; bullock , wechsler , & somerville 2002 ) , supporting scenarios in which lbg starbursts are brief and merger - driven @xcite . because the star formation histories in these two pictures differ starkly , it is of great interest to establish observationally how lbgs star formation rates , stellar population ages , stellar and gas masses , and dynamical timescales relate to each other .",
    "in particular , fully understanding star formation in lbgs requires characterizing the molecular gas from which their stars form ; this motivates searches for co line emission in at least a few representative systems .",
    "the logical first target for such an effort was the gravitationally lensed system ms1512-cb58 ( hereafter cb58 ) , the brightest lbg known .",
    "baker et al .",
    "( 2004 ; b04 ) succeeded in detecting cb58 s co(32 ) emission after probing to greater depths than were reached by two previously published nondetections . as a second target , we chose westphal - md11 ( hereafter wmd11 ) , the dustiest lbg known .",
    "this @xmath0 system was the strongest @xmath1 source in the submillimeter common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) survey of @xcite and was revealed in high - resolution _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and keck imaging to be a composite system including one extremely red object ( ero ) component , two bluer ones , and a web of diffuse blue emission @xcite . since wmd11 s @xmath4 resembled",
    "that observed for cb58 @xcite , we reasoned that the two galaxies co emission lines should also be comparably strong .",
    "instead , we report an upper limit on wmd11 s co(32 ) emission based on sensitive millimeter interferometry .",
    "this paper assumes @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 throughout .",
    "we observed wmd11 with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi : guilloteau et al .",
    "1992 ) from 2003 april through september .",
    "the array included four to six 15 m diameter antennas ; during our observations , these were arranged in variations on a compact d configuration with baselines ranging from 24 to 113 m .",
    "the 3 mm receiver on each antenna was tuned in single - sideband mode , giving typical system temperatures of 100200k in the lower sideband relative to the reference . to observe wmd11",
    ", we adopted as a pointing center the position ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) listed by @xcite and used for the scuba observations of @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath10 reported by @xcite , the co(32 ) rotational transition is redshifted to 86.85ghz .",
    "we deployed four correlator modules at this frequency , giving a total of 560mhz ( @xmath11 ) of contiguous bandwidth at @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) resolution .",
    "although we also tuned each antenna s 1 mm receiver for simultaneous 242ghz observations of thermal dust emission , the summer weather conditions caused prohibitively high phase noise and prevented us from using these data .",
    "we calibrated the data using the clic routines in the gildas package @xcite .",
    "phase and amplitude variations within each track were removed by interleaving observations of the quasar j1419 + 543 ( @xmath14 from wmd11 on the sky ) every 30 minutes .",
    "passband calibration used one of several bright quasars .",
    "the flux scale for each epoch was set by comparing j1419 + 543 with the passband calibrators and model sources crl618 and mwc349 , whose flux densities are regularly monitored at the pdbi and iram 30 m . from the variance of multiple measurements , we estimate the accuracy of our final flux scale to be @xmath15 . before constructing @xmath16 tables from our calibrated data , we smoothed them to 5mhz ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) resolution .",
    "after editing for quality , we were left with the ( on - source , six - telescope array ) equivalent of 42hr of data .",
    "we inverted the data cube without deconvolution using the imagr task in the nrao aips package @xcite . with natural weighting ,",
    "the synthesized beam is @xmath18 at p.  a. @xmath19 ; the noise level per channel is @xmath20 across most of the bandpass before rising slightly at the high - velocity ( low - frequency ) end .    after we had already acquired the pdbi data , we learned ( n. reddy , private communication ) that a comprehensive registration of radio , optical , and x - ray sources in the westphal field implies a true position for wmd11 some",
    "@xmath21 northeast of its published coordinates ( at @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "this offset implies pointing errors aside that for the @xmath24 hpbw of scuba at @xmath1 , the @xmath25 reported by @xcite should translate to @xmath26 at the actual position of the lbg .",
    "the offset also means that any co(32 ) emission from wmd11 should not lie at the pdbi phase center .    with cursory inspection showing no strong source",
    ", we searched for line emission by convolving the @xmath27 cube with seven- and sixteen - channel boxcars .",
    "the resulting cubes have @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) channels , each of which overlaps its nearest neighbors by @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the @xmath32 width was chosen to match @xmath33 @xcite by analogy with cb58 , in which @xmath34 ( b04 ) .",
    "the @xmath35 width allows for a ratio @xmath36 , the highest value seen for @xmath37 among twelve ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) observed by both @xcite and @xcite . , while the data of @xcite for a smaller ulirg sample give @xmath38 . ]",
    "neither convolved cube shows a significant source at the position of wmd11 . corrected for primary beam response , the @xmath39 upper limit of @xmath40 implies a line luminosity @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "in view of the encouraging intelligence available before we began our campaign , the failure to detect wmd11 is rather surprising . empirically , its line / continuum ratio ( calculated here as @xmath43 ) of @xmath44 is @xmath45 of that seen for cb58 and @xmath46 of the mean for four @xmath47 submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) with published co(32 ) detections @xcite .",
    "wmd11 probably does not have a strong co(32 ) line lying outside the bandpass of our pdbi observations .",
    "its @xmath48 is known to @xmath49 ( m. pettini , private communication ) and is nearly identical for its blue and ero components @xcite . relative to this @xmath48 , its interstellar absorption lines are blueshifted by only @xmath50 and its @xmath51 emission redshifted by only @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "given such a limited velocity range ( and the modest @xmath53 seen in cb58 by b04 ) , it seems very unlikely that a molecular line could lie at such a high ( @xmath54 ) offset from wmd11 s systemic velocity as to escape detection .    an alternate explanation for our co(32 )",
    "nondetection would posit that the dust emission seen by @xcite comes from a highly obscured companion or background galaxy rather than from wmd11 itself .",
    "@xcite show the surface density of smgs with @xmath55 to be @xmath56 ; we might then expect the original survey of 16 lbg fields by @xcite to have turned up @xmath57 sources in this brightness regime at random . while such odds are not negligible , wmd11 s unusually red @xmath58 color @xcite , together with the systematic dependence of 1.2 mm flux density on this color in a larger lbg sample ( a. baker et al .",
    "2004 , in preparation ) , suggests that some association of the @xmath1 source with the rest uv / optical counterpart is reasonable .",
    "ruling out a nearby companion to wmd11 takes more effort .",
    "if we no longer require that the @xmath1 emission come from wmd11 per se , we can look for co sources that differ sharply from the lbg in position ( e.g. , neri et al .",
    "2003 ) , velocity , and/or line width .",
    "we have therefore smoothed the data cube to several velocity widths ( up to @xmath59 ) and searched for companions within @xmath60 of the pdbi phase center ( beyond this radius , a source would have to be unrealistically bright to have produced 5.5mjy at the scuba pointing center ) . in each smoothed cube ,",
    "the strongest candidate companion has @xmath61 significance , lies near a bowl of comparable ( negative ) significance , and lacks an optical counterpart when the pipeline - reduced _ hst _ imaging of @xcite is re - examined . in most cases ,",
    "the implied @xmath43 is even lower than @xmath62 owing to the larger correction that must be made to @xmath4 for a `` source '' farther from the phase center .",
    "we do not view any of these candidates as real .",
    "it remains possible that a dusty companion lies close enough on the sky to wmd11 to yield a strong @xmath1 detection but far enough away in velocity to escape our pdbi bandpass .",
    "however , this scenario is dismayingly ad hoc , in that it divorces a high dust luminosity at a level attained only by galaxy mergers in the local universe from a system with a clear merger morphology .",
    "it remains to explain how wmd11 can generate a large dust luminosity from a small reservoir of molecular gas .",
    "exactly how much of a challenge this is depends on the value of the galaxy s ir luminosity , which we can calculate from its @xmath1 ( @xmath63 rest - frame ) flux density and the assumption of an opacity - weighted blackbody spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the dust temperature and @xmath66 is the rest frequency at which the dust opacity is unity .",
    "we will ( for now ) neglect any contribution from hotter dust at wavelengths below the blackbody peak , making the frequency integral of this @xmath67 a conservative lower limit on @xmath68 . combined with our upper limit on co(32 ) emission ,",
    "a given choice of @xmath69 then gives us a conservative lower limit on the ratio @xmath70 .",
    "for a particular @xmath65 , however , this ratio also has a firm _ upper _ limit . in the molecular interstellar medium of normal galaxies ,",
    "a co emission line will be optically thick at some brightness temperature @xmath71 ( less than the gas kinetic temperature @xmath72 as a result of subthermal excitation ) , while dust with @xmath73 produces far - ir continuum emission that is optically thin . as density and column density increase",
    ", @xmath74 will rise as the co transition is thermalized ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) , but @xmath68 will rise much more dramatically as the dust emission becomes optically thick .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath76 is reached when both dust and gas are radiating as blackbodies with @xmath77 . @xcite",
    "have shown that this `` blackbody [ upper ] limit '' is @xmath78 and that local ulirgs fall only a factor of @xmath79 below it .",
    "for wmd11 , the observed @xmath1 flux density and upper limit(s ) on co(32 ) emission are only compatible with the upper limit on @xmath80 imposed by equation [ e - bb ] for a severely limited range of seds . for @xmath42 ,",
    "dust temperatures @xmath81 are excluded at once because the blackbody limit they impose is simply too stringent .",
    "more generally , we require a quite small value of @xmath66 for any choice of @xmath65 and @xmath82 if we are to suppress @xmath68 relative to @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ f - tau ] shows the dependence of @xmath83 as a function of @xmath65 , @xmath82 , and @xmath84 if wmd11 exactly satisfies the blackbody limit . for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 will produce dust emission that is optically thick at rest wavelengths @xmath88 .",
    "given that local ulirgs do not themselves reach equality in equation [ e - bb ] , this conclusion should hold robustly for most plausible @xmath89 . for @xmath90 , dust emission at rest wavelength @xmath91 will be optically thick for _ any _ sed .    if wmd11 s observed @xmath1 emission is indeed optically thick , we can estimate the characteristic size of the emitting region ( assuming a spherical geometry ) as @xmath92 for a fiducial @xmath93 , wmd11",
    "s @xmath94 translates to @xmath95 , and thus to a radius @xmath96 .",
    "assuming @xmath97 and 90k yields @xmath98 and @xmath99 respectively ( although recall that @xmath86 is incompatible with @xmath100 ) .",
    "such radii are comparable to the sizes of molecular gas disks in local ulirgs @xcite .",
    "indeed , the same logic works in reverse : @xcite point to the compact molecular gas structures in ulirgs as evidence for high optical depths , which they use in turn to explain these systems high @xmath76 ratios .",
    "our conclusion that the dust source in wmd11 is both optically thick out to long rest wavelengths and spatially compact is independent of whether its @xmath68 is powered by star formation or accretion . given the lack of evidence for an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) in either optical spectroscopy or radio continuum mapping of wmd11 @xcite , a compact starburst seems more likely .",
    "however , the cautionary example of the @xmath101 @xmath51 nebula detected at @xmath1 by @xcite , for which accretion remains one of the few plausible sources of ionizing photons @xcite , suggests a deeply embedded agn should not be excluded for wmd11 either .",
    "given wmd11 s morphological resemblance to an early - stage galaxy merger and its large ir luminosity , we estimate its molecular gas mass using the @xmath102 conversion factor appropriate for local ulirgs .",
    "@xcite suggest that this should be lower than the galactic value and @xmath103 , which for @xmath104 gives wmd11 a molecular gas mass of @xmath105 ( including helium ) that could plausibly have originated in a single progenitor spiral @xcite .",
    "wmd11 s ero component may be the remnant of a second , older spheroid progenitor : @xcite note that if all of its redness ( @xmath106 ) is attributed to extinction , the system s total @xmath1 flux density would be overpredicted by a substantial factor .    to estimate wmd11 s star formation rate",
    ", we calculate its _ total _ ( @xmath107",
    ") @xmath68 by smoothly grafting a short - wavelength power law @xmath108 @xcite onto the fiducial sed used in  [ s - res ] .",
    "this step properly includes emission from hotter dust . for @xmath109 , we begin with @xmath110 and obtain @xmath111 , which for a @xmath112 @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) corresponds to a star formation rate of @xmath113 @xcite . for @xmath114 , we must adopt a higher @xmath115 , which gives @xmath116 and a star formation rate @xmath117 .",
    "@xcite estimate ( for the same imf ) that the star formation rate in wmd11 is @xmath118 from @xmath119 line and rest - uv continuum fluxes before correction of either for extinction . in hindsight",
    ", the agreement between those estimates does not point to a low global dust obscuration , but to a complex geometry in which blue star - forming patches are scattered about the periphery of a dusty starburst core .",
    "such configurations are also seen locally : local ulirgs can have quite blue uv colors that conceal their true degree of obscuration @xcite , while the most massive molecular gas concentrations and intense star formation can occur off the optically bright nuclei in nearby mergers like the antennae @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the molecular gas mass and star formation rate in wmd11 nominally limits the gas exhaustion timescale to a short @xmath120 , modulo large uncertanties in sed and @xmath84 .",
    "an instructive contrast can be drawn with cb58 , which is forming stars according to a @xcite law with a much longer @xmath121 comparable to its most likely age for past star formation ( b04 ) .",
    "differing modes of star formation in these two lbgs naturally explain why we are apparently catching wmd11 closer to the endpoint of its evolution than cb58 .",
    "in a major merger , gas from the progenitor galaxies will be rapidly dumped into the system s center of mass or ejected into tidal tails ( from which infall and ensuing star formation will be slow ) .",
    "since the central starburst will shut off abruptly as soon as the central gas concentration has been consumed or expelled by a wind , we might expect that if wmd11 is a major merger , we should indeed be catching it near the end of a brief burst . for more quiescent star formation in a disk ,",
    "an extended reservoir would be capable of refilling a molecular gas reservoir at smaller radii .",
    "we would therefore expect that lbgs like cb58 , in which star formation has a less violent trigger , would tend to be observed in the middle of a star formation episode without a sharply defined end . with this new evidence that lbgs can have quite different modes of star formation ,",
    "it is clear that understanding the distribution of such modes across the full lbg population will be important in constraining these systems contributions to the cosmic histories of star formation and mass assembly .",
    "we are grateful to iram staff members , particularly r. neri , for assistance in acquiring and reducing the data .",
