    "in this work we obtain some exact and new results for the coarsening dynamics  @xcite of a non - conserved scalar field in two dimensions , demonstrating , _ en passant _ , the validity of the _ dynamical scaling hypothesis _ for this system .",

    "[ fig : snapshots0 ] for the coarsening of the two - dimensional ising model ( @xmath13im ) on a square lattice quenched from an equilibrium state at @xmath14 .",
    "a _ domain _ is a region of connected aligned spins .",
    "each domain has one external perimeter which is called the _",
    "hull_. the _ hull enclosed area _",
    "is the total area within this perimeter , _",
    "i.e. _ the domain area plus the area of any internal sub - domain .",
    "domain perimeter _ is the total length of the interface between the chosen domain and the neighbouring ones  including the hull and internal borders .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch - domains - hulls ] for a sketch explaining these definitions .",
    "the paper deals primarily with the distributions of two characteristic areas , the domain area and the hull enclosed area , and their associated lengths , the domain wall perimeter and the hull length .",
    "naively , one may imagine that coarsening is basically due to the coalescence of small domains that form larger ones .",
    "however , in two dimensional curvature driven coarsening coalescence processes are quite unimportant as shown by the allen - cahn result .",
    "all the interfaces move with a local velocity that is proportional to the local curvature and points in the direction of decreasing the curvature ; therefore , interfaces tend to disappear independently of one another .",
    "this is the reason why we first focused on the statistics of hull enclosed areas , quantities that depend on the motion of a single and connected interface , and not on the statistics of the more natural domain areas .",
    "next we expressed the statistics of the domain areas in terms of the simpler and more clear statistics of hull enclosed areas .",
    "hull enclosed and domain areas have distributions that , at late times after the quench into the ordered phase , exhibit , according to the scaling hypothesis , the scaling form @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of hulls ( domains ) per unit area with area in the range @xmath17 .",
    "the argument of the scaling function arises from the fact that the characteristic length scale is known to grow as @xmath18 , so the characteristic area ( of hulls and domains ) grows as @xmath19 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath20 will be different for domains and hulls .",
    "the prefactor @xmath21 follows from the fact that there is of order one hull ( or domain ) per scale area .",
    "our analytical result is an elegant application of the gauss - bonnet theorem and , it should be emphasized , its simplicity relies on the dimensionality of the system being 2 .",
    "indeed , in three dimensions , the time variation of the hull enclosed volume depends on a characteristic size of the domain .",
    "a similar dependence on the dimension is also observed in the von neumann s law for cellular systems , whose simple form , independent of any linear size of the system , is also only observed in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "in this paper we derive these scaling forms from first principles ( i.e. without recourse to the scaling hypothesis ) , and determine explicitly the scaling functions .",
    "some of our results have appeared earlier in letter form @xcite .",
    "hulls and domain boundary lengths are themselves distributed quantities related in a non - trivial manner to their corresponding areas . in this paper",

    "a number of general properties of hull enclosed and domain areas as well as hull and domain wall perimeters can be easily derived just by using the scaling hypothesis and two sum rules .",
    "we summarize them here .      at long times , and irrespective of the initial condition , the total number of domain and hull enclosed areas per unit area , @xmath72 , should scale as @xmath73 in @xmath74 dimensions , with @xmath75 a characteristic length scale usually associated to the ` typical ' domain radius . for pure ferromagnetic coarsening , @xmath76 from which it follows that @xmath77 in @xmath78 .",

    "we now present two exact sum rules which provide useful input for the analysis of @xmath90 .",
    "these sum rules apply at all times @xmath91 , for any initial condition , and for any working temperature .",

    "we find the same exponent as for zero temperature coarsening that is also the initial condition exponent ( @xmath23 or @xmath216 ) .",
    "this is reasonable since the large structures are still ` unaware ' of the coarsening process and thus retain the form they had in the initial configuration . for small areas , instead , we see domain walls roughening due to thermal agitation but it is hard to extract the value of the exponent @xmath433 with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the scaling of the perimeter number densities and the functional form for the scaling function predicted analytically describe the numerical data with high precision once the values of the exponents @xmath371 , the prefactors @xmath414 , and the parameter @xmath434 are modified to take into account thermal agitation ( for absolute area values larger than @xmath348 , this value limits the range of areas where the effect of thermal fluctuations is larger than the ones of coarsening ) .",

    "in this paper we studied the statistics and geometry of hull enclosed and domain areas and interfaces during the non - equilibrium dynamics of curvature driven pure coarsening in two dimensions .",

    "our main results are : ( i ) we proved scaling of the various number densities studied .",
    "( ii ) we derived the exact number density of hull enclosed areas and hull lengths ; we obtained approximate expressions for the number density of domain areas and domain wall lengths .",
    "( iii ) the geometrical properties and distribution of the time dependent large structures ( by large we mean much larger than the average ones ) are the ones of critical continuous percolation ( for all initial conditions equilibrated at @xmath14 ) and critical ising ( for @xmath216 ) .",
    "the long interfaces retain the fractal geometry imposed by the equilibrium initial condition and the scaling function of all number densities decay as power laws .",
    "( iv ) instead , small structures progressively become regular and the area - perimeter relation is @xmath438 .",
    "( v ) we took into account the effects of a finite working temperature by correctly eliminating purely thermal fluctuations and thus correctly identifying the coarsening structures .",

    "@xmath440 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath98 that vanishes at @xmath46 .",
    "it is important to stress that our analytic results rely on the use of the allen - cahn result for the velocity of an almost flat interface .",
    "thus , they would be expected to hold only in a statistical sense and for large structures in the lattice model .",
    "surprisingly , we found with numerical simulations that the number density area distributions in the @xmath13im match the analytic predictions for very small structures , and even after a few mc steps evolution of a critical ising initial condition for which rather rough interfaces exist .    using the allen - cahn result and a variety of numerical measurements we verified the well - known result for pure coarsening with non - conserved order parameter :",
    "there is a characteristic growing length that increases in time as @xmath18 .",
    "the mesoscopic analysis presented here allows us to demonstrate that the reason for the growth of the characteristic length is the disappearance of small structures .",

    "[ sec : oned ] we summarized the behaviour of the distribution of domain lengths in the ising chain . as expected from scaling arguments , this quantity scales with the typical domain length , @xmath441 but the form of the scaling function is very different from the one in two dimensions : the pdf vanishes at zero scaling argument ( @xmath299 ) , it then increases linearly to reach a maximum and then falls - off to zero exponentially . on the other hand , we can not extend the analytic argument to dimensions higher than two since the hull enclosed volumes no longer decrease with time in a manner that does not depend on their own volume  @xcite .",
    "this paper and @xcite open the way to a number of related studies .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to extend the analysis presented here to dynamic clusters of correlated spins ( droplets ) , that are known to describe thermal fluctuations close to the transition ( see  @xcite and  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these droplets are smaller than the geometric clusters in which they are embedded because some of the neighboring parallel spins are discarded ( by a temperature dependent criteria ) for not being correlated ( remember that even at infinite temperature , where all spins are uncorrelated , there are domains of parallel spins ) .",
    "two - dimensional coarsening with conserved order parameter is another problem that deserves a careful study along these lines .    in  @xcite",
    "we include a preliminary analysis of the hull and domain structure in the finite temperature dynamics of the bi - dimensional random bond ferromagnetic ising model after a quench from infinite temperature .",
    "in such a disordered case a finite working temperature is necessary to help the interfaces depin from pinning centers in the quenched disordered potential through thermal activation .",
    "we first computed the typical domain radius that scales the time - dependent spatial correlation , @xmath442 , in the scaling regime . due to",
    "the presence of quenched disorder @xmath75 strongly depends on temperature and the strength of randomness and it is slower than the simple square root behaviour of the pure ising case .",
    "we then showed numerically that the number density of hull enclosed and domain areas scale as @xmath443 for areas satisfying @xmath444 and that are smaller than the cut - off set by finite size effects .",
    "the effect of a non - trivial typical radius @xmath75 determined by the quenched disorder can be tested in the intermediate regime , say @xmath445 , where the quality of the scaling plot is excellent .",
    "the scaling function @xmath446 does not depend on the disorder strength satisfying the hyper - scaling hypothesis  @xcite . for smaller areas ,",
    "say @xmath447 , the contribution of thermal domains with domain walls roughened by disorder is important .",
    "we shall give more details on the domain morphology of the quenched disordered coarsening problem in a separate publication  @xcite .",
    "these results give an idea of the richness and complexity of coarsening phenomena even in the absence of quenched randomness .",
    "we expect them to be of help in understanding the fluctuating dynamics of even more complex situations , like spin - glasses and glassy problems  @xcite , in which the mere existence of a domain growth of two competing equilibrium phases is not even established .",
    "in order to obtain the size of each hull in an @xmath448 system , a biased walk along the interior border of each domain is performed , with the hull enclosed area being updated at each step .",
    "this algorithm is related to , but different from the grossman - aharony proposal .    _",

    "although such domains may be excluded from the statistics , for finite sizes the introduced bias is unacceptable .",
    "thus , before starting , we try to find another site in the same cluster above or to the left of the original spin , where a new starting site may be found .",
