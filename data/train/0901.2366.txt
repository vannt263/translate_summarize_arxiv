    "recent neutrino oscillation experiments , such as t2k and miniboone , point to the urgency of more theoretical work on neutrino - nucleus reactions in the sub- and few - gev region .",
    "one of such reactions is coherent pion production in which the final nucleus remains in its ground state .",
    "the processes in neutrino - nucleus scattering are dominated by quasi - elastic scattering and quasi - free @xmath0-excitation ( with its subsequent decay ) , and the coherent processes represent a small fraction .",
    "even so , it is important to take accurate account of the coherent processes in order to achieve a significant reduction of theoretical uncertainties in interpreting data of the neutrino oscillation experiments . lately",
    ", several neutrino experimental groups presented new data on coherent pion production in both charged - current ( cc)@xcite and neutral - current ( nc ) reactions@xcite , and also for the anti - neutrino reaction@xcite .",
    "it is therefore timely to develop a theoretical model whose accuracy matches the precision of these new data . we report here our study of coherent pion production in neutrino - nucleus scattering , explaining a calculational framework we have recently developed and presenting numerical results .",
    "as a starting point for studying pion production in neutrino - nucleus scattering , we need a model which reasonably describes electroweak pion production off a single nucleon .",
    "we employ here the sato - lee ( sl ) model@xcite , which is considered to provide a reliable framework for this purpose . in applying the sl model to a reaction on a nuclear target ,",
    "we need to consider medium effects as well .",
    "major medium effects are known to be the change of the @xmath0-propagation ( shifts of the mass and width ) and the final - state interactions ( fsi ) between the outgoing pion and nucleus . in the energy region of our interest ,",
    "the @xmath0-hole model@xcite is believed to allow us to incorporate these medium effects .",
    "we therefore expect that the combined use of the sl model and the @xmath0-hole model will lead to a reasonable theoretical framework for calculating pion production in nuclei .",
    "we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we construct an optical potential for pion - nucleus scattering ; this potential is used to take account of the fsi on the outgoing pion .",
    "our model involves four free complex parameters ; two of them are responsible for the medium effect on the @xmath0 ( the so - called spreading potential ) , and the other two pertain to phenomenological pion - nucleus interactions , which are proportional to the square of the nuclear density .",
    "all of these parameters are fixed so as to optimize fit to experimental data for pion - nucleus scattering ( both elastic and total cross sections ) .",
    "we then are in a position to calculate the coherent pion production process without free parameters . to test the reliability of our approach",
    ", we apply our model to coherent pion `` photo''-production and compare the results with data . after this test",
    ", we calculate coherent pion production in neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "the results are compared with the recent data from k2k@xcite .",
    "pion momentum distribution for @xmath1 ( @xmath2  gev ) ; neutrino - nucleus cm frame . for explanation of the curves , see the text . , width=234 ]    pion momentum distribution for @xmath1 ( @xmath2  gev ) ; neutrino - nucleus cm frame . for explanation of the curves , see the text .",
    ", width=234 ]    figure  [ fig1 ] shows our results for the pion angular distribution in coherent pion photo - production off @xmath3c .",
    "the dashed curve represents the case that does not include fsi or the shifts of the @xmath0 mass and width ; medium effects enter only through the nuclear form factor here .",
    "the results obtained with fsi included are given by the dotted curve , while the results of our full calculation that takes into account both fsi and the in - medium modification of the @xmath0 properties are shown by the solid curve .",
    "our results are fairly consistent with the data around the peak .",
    "the large discrepancy between the calculation and the data at @xmath4 is due to the fact that the data include incoherent contributions from low - lying excited states .",
    "the reasonable agreement between theory and experiment seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] provides a good basis to proceed to calculate the neutrino - induced process .",
    "our results for neutrino - induced cc coherent pion production are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ; the figure shows the pion momentum spectrum for @xmath5 1  gev ( @xmath6 : neutrino energy ) . here",
    "again , the dashed curve corresponds to the case in which fsi and the shifts of the @xmath0 mass and width are ignored , the dotted curve to the case that only includes fsi , and the solid curve to the full calculation that includes fsi and the in - medium modification of the @xmath0 properties .",
    "the important role of the medium effects is clearly seen .",
    "the total cross section is 9.5 @xmath7 for @xmath5 1  gev . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the upper limit of the total cross section averaged over the neutrino spectrum is given ; @xmath8 .",
    "( reference @xcite presented a similar result . )",
    "although the total cross section averaged over the neutrino spectrum is yet to be calculated , it seems that our results are significantly larger than the experimental upper limit .",
    "it is noted , however , that the upper limit was obtained from the analysis which was partly based on theoretical models ( quasi - elastic , resonant 1@xmath9 , etc . ) which are still under active debate",
    ". a better understanding of the other processes together with the pion coherent production process is highly desirable .",
    "in this work we constructed a model for coherent pion production in neutrino - nucleus scattering around 1  gev .",
    "the model is based on a combination of the sl model and the @xmath0-hole model .",
    "we fixed all the free parameters in our model by fitting to pion - nucleus scattering data .",
    "the results for the photon - induced coherent pion production were found to be in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "for the neutrino - induced process , however , our initial results are not consistent with the recent data from k2k and sciboone .",
    "we plan to study the origin of this inconsistency , and then to apply our model to the nc reaction and the anti - neutrino process .",
