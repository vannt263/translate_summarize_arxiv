    "the study of possible modifications of einstein s theory of gravity has a long history which reaches back to the early 1920s @xcite .",
    "corrections to the gravitational lagrangian , leading to higher - order field equations , were already studied by several authors @xcite shortly after general relativity ( gr ) was proposed .",
    "developments in the 1960s and 1970s @xcite , partly motivated by the quantization schemes proposed at that time , made clear that theories containing _ only _ a @xmath6 term in the lagrangian were not viable with respect to their weak field behavior .",
    "buchdahl , in 1962 @xcite , rejected pure @xmath6 theories because of the non - existence of asymptotically flat solutions .    in recent years",
    ", the effort to give a physical explanation to the today observed cosmic acceleration @xcite has attracted a good amount of interest in @xmath0-gravity , considered as a viable mechanism to explain the cosmic acceleration by extending the geometric sector of field equations without the introduction of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "there are several physical and mathematical motivations to enlarge gr by these theories . for comprehensive review ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "other issues as , for example , the observed pioneer anomaly problem @xcite can be framed into the same approach @xcite and then , apart the cosmological dynamics , a systematic analysis of such theories urges at short scale and in the low energy limit .    while it is very natural to extend einstein s gravity to theories with additional geometric degrees of freedom , recent attempts focused on the old idea of modifying the gravitational lagrangian in a purely metric framework , leading to higher - order field equations . due to the increased complexity of the field equations in this framework , the main body of works dealt with some formally equivalent theories , in which a reduction of the order of the field equations was achieved by considering the metric and the connection as independent objects @xcite .",
    "in addition , many authors exploited the formal relationship to scalar - tensor theories to make some statements about the weak field regime @xcite , which was already worked out for scalar - tensor theories @xcite .",
    "also a post - newtonian parameterization with metric approach in the jordan frame has been considered @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the post newtonian limit of @xmath0 in the harmonic gauge .",
    "we are going to focus on the small velocity and weak field limit within the metric approach . in principle , any alternative or extended theory of gravity should allow to recover positive results of general relativity",
    ". it will be very important to check at any level of our modified theory we can cover the outcomes of gr .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the sec.[fieldequations ] , we report the complete scheme of newtonian and post - newtonian limit of field equations for @xmath0-gravity and their formal solutions in the harmonic gauge condition .",

    "in fact dark matter could be nothing else but the effects that gr , experimentally tested only up to solar system scales , does not work at extragalactic scales and then it has to be corrected .",
    "then it is worth pointing out that @xmath0-gravity seem good candidate to solve several shortcomings of modern astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "taking into account the results presented , it is clear that only gr presents directly the newtonian potential in the weak field limit while corrections appear as soon as the theory is non - linear in the ricci scalar .    in forthcoming researches",
