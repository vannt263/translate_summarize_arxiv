    "the site or sites of the r - process are not known , although suggestions include the @xmath3-driven wind of type ii supernova @xcite , the mergers of neutron stars @xcite , aic ( accretion - induced collapse ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and type-1.5 supernova @xcite .",
    "the neutron - capture elements can be composed of some pure r - process , pure s - process , and some mixed - parentage isotopes . as a result ,",
    "when the solar system total abundances(t@xmath4 ) are separated into contribution from the s - process(s@xmath4 ) and the r - process(r@xmath4 ) , some elements are mostly contributed by r - process , such as eu , and some by the s - process , such as ba .",
    "therefore eu is commonly referred to as an `` r - process element '' and ba , as an `` s - process element '' .    in an early systematic study of elemental abundances in halo stars",
    ", @xcite found that the neutron - capture elements ba and y were over - deficient with respect to iron , and that the barium abundance increased almost as fast as iron at low metallicity , suggesting a common origin in massive stars . based on this suggestion ,",
    "@xcite supposed that in the early galaxy the neutron - capture elements were formed exclusively through the r - process .",
    "observations of metal - poor stars with metallicities lower than [ fe / h ] @xmath5 enriched in neutron - capture elements have further supported this hypothesis @xcite .",
    "although the material from which stars form is not expected to contain significant s - process contributions , some stars including some subgiants are greatly enriched in carbon and s - elements ( s - rich stars hereafter ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are believed to be binary companions of initially more - massive donor stars which have evolved through the thermally pulsing agb phase and transferred material enriched in c and s - process elements onto the lower mass , longer lived secondary now observed .",
    "the generally favoured s - process model by now is associated with the partial mixing of protons ( pmp hereafter ) into the radiative c - rich layers during thermal pulses @xcite .",
    "pmp activates the chain of reactions @xmath6c(p,@xmath7)@xmath8n(@xmath9 ) + @xmath8c(@xmath10,n)@xmath11o which likely occurs in a narrow mass region of the he intershell ( i.e. @xmath8c - pocket ) during the interpulse phases of an agb star . using the primary - like neutron source ( i.e. @xmath8c(@xmath10,n)@xmath11o ) and starting with a very low initial metallicity",
    ", most iron seeds are converted into @xmath12pb .",
    "so , when third dredge - up episodes mix the neutron - capture products into the envelope , the star appears s - enhanced and lead - rich .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of neutron - capture elements in the carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars ( hereafter cemp stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be investigated by abundance studies of s - rich or r - rich stars .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed the spectra of the lead - rich ultra - metal - poor star cs 30322 - 023 , and concluded that the observed abundances could not be well fit by a scaled solar system r - process ( r@xmath4 ) pattern nor by the s - process pattern of an agb model ( 0.8m@xmath13 , [ fe / h ] @xmath14 ) .",
    "this star shows enhancement of the neutron - capture elements ba and pb , but the discovery that several neutron - capture elements such as sr and eu are deficient with respect to iron is puzzling .",
    "@xcite estimated that cs 30322 - 023 is the most evolved cemp star , probably on the agb stage , possibly even in the thermally pulsing ( helium shell flashing ) stage .",
    "however , there is another possibility for the s - enhanced scenario of cs 30322 - 023 . because of the strong n overabundance , the na overabundance and the absence of a strong c overabundance ,",
    "@xcite have also speculated that this star should be polluted by an agb star , which has a mass of at least 2.0m@xmath13 for the possible hot - bottom burning .",
    "clearly , the restudy of elemental abundances in this object is still very important for well understanding the nucleosynthesis of neutron - capture elements in early galaxy .",
    "there have been many theoretical studies of s - process nucleosynthesis in low - mass agb stars .",
    "unfortunately , the precise mechanism for chemical mixing of protons from the hydrogen - rich envelope into the @xmath6c - rich layer to form a @xmath8c - pocket is still unknown @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to adopt the parametric model for metal - poor stars presented by @xcite and developed by @xcite to study the physical conditions which could reproduce the observed abundance pattern found in this star . in this paper",
    "we investigate the characteristics of the nucleosynthesis pathway that produces the special abundance ratios of s - rich object cs 30322 - 023 using the s - process parametric model @xcite .",
    "the calculated results are presented in sect .  2 in which we also discuss the characteristics of the s - process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "we explored the origin of the neutron - capture elements in cs 30322 - 023 by comparing the observed abundances with predicted s- and r - process contribution . for this purpose",
    ", we adopt the parametric model for metal - poor stars presented by zhang et al.(2006 ) .",
    "the @xmath15-th element abundance in the envelope of the star can be calculated as follows : @xmath16 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the metallicity of the star , @xmath18 is the abundance of the _ i_-th element produced by the s - process in the agb star and @xmath19 is the abundance of the _ i_-th element produced by the r - process ( per si @xmath20 at @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the component coefficients that correspond to contributions from the s - process and the r - process respectively .",
    "there are four parameters in the parametric model of s- and r - rich stars ( hereafter s+r stars ) .",
    "they are the neutron exposure per thermal pulse @xmath24 , the overlap factor @xmath25 , the component coefficient of the s - process @xmath26 and the component coefficient of the r - process @xmath27 .",
    "the adopted initial abundances of seed nuclei lighter than the iron peak elements were taken to be the solar - system abundances , scaled to the value of [ fe / h ] of the star . because the neutron - capture - element component of the interstellar gas that formed very mental - deficient stars is expected to consist of mostly pure r - process elements , for the other heavier nuclei we use the r - process abundances of the solar system @xcite , normalized to the value of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the abundances of r - process nuclei in equation ( 1 ) are taken to be the solar - system r - process abundances @xcite for the elements heavier than ba , for the other lighter nuclei we use solar - system r - process abundances multiplied by a factor of 0.4266 @xcite . using the observed data in the sample star cs 30322 - 023 @xcite",
    ", the parameters in the model can be obtained from the parametric approach .",
    "figure 1 shows our calculated best - fit result . for this star ,",
    "the curves produced by the model are consistent with the observed abundances within the error limits .",
    "the agreement of the model results with the observations provides strong support to the validity of the parametric model . in the agb model ,",
    "the overlap factor , @xmath25 , is a fundamental parameter . @xcite",
    "have found an overlap factor of @xmath28 in their standard evolution model of low - mass ( @xmath29 ) agb stars at solar metallicity .",
    "the overlap factor calculated for other s - enhanced metal - poor stars lies between 0.1 and 0.81 @xcite .",
    "the overlap factor deduced for cs 30322 - 023 is about @xmath30 , which lies in both ranges above .",
    "the neutron exposure per pulse , @xmath24 , is another fundamental parameter in the agb model . @xcite",
    "have deduced the neutron exposure per pulse for other s - enhanced metal - poor stars which lies between 0.45 and 0.88 mbarn@xmath31 .",
    "the neutron exposure deduced for cs 30322 - 023 is about @xmath32 mbarn@xmath31 . in the case of multiple subsequent exposures ,",
    "the mean neutron exposure is given by @xmath33 .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that the value of @xmath34 mbarn@xmath31(in this work , @xmath35 , in units of 10@xmath36 k ) for cs 30322 - 023 is significantly larger than those which best fit solar - system material , @xmath37 mbarn@xmath31 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the higher mean neutron exposure favors large amounts of production of the heavier elements such as pb , ba etc . and less sr , y etc .",
    "@xcite , which should be one reason of the puzzling abundance pattern of the s - process elements , i.e. ba , pb etc .",
    "show enhancement , and sr , y etc .",
    "exhibit deficient with respect to iron .",
    "we explore possibility that cs 30322 - 023 belongs to a binary system . in this case",
    ", the enhancement of the neutron - capture elements ba and pb suggests that in a binary system a mass - transfer episode from a former agb star took place .",
    "one major goal of this work is to explore the astrophysical condition , associated with an agb star in a binary system , in which several neutron - capture elements such as sr and eu are deficient with respect to iron .",
    "it should be noted that the s - process abundances in the envelope of the stars could be expected to be lower than the abundance produced by the s - process in the agb star because the material is mixed with the envelopes of the primary ( former agb star ) and secondary stars .",
    "the component coefficient of the r - process calculated for cs 30322 - 023 is about @xmath38 , which means that the star and its agb companion formed in a molecular cloud which had never been polluted by r - process material .",
    "this fact can directly lead to the special abundance pattern that several neutron - capture elements are deficient with respect to iron , such as eu and sr .",
    "@xcite speculates that the strong metallicity dependence of mass loss during the agb phase leads to a steeper initial - final mass relation for low - metalliciy stars ; that is , for a given initial mass the final mass is higher for metal - poor stars .",
    "therefore , the core of , e.g. , an metal - poor star with [ fe / h]@xmath39 having an initial mass of 4.0m@xmath13 , would reach the chandrasekhar mass , leading to a `` type 1.5 supernova '' .",
    "in such a supernova , r - process nucleosynthesis might have occurred , and the surface of the companion star observed today could have been polluted with the elements that were produced . since the sample star had never been polluted by r - process material , a smaller initial mass ( m@xmath40m@xmath13 ) of the former agb companion could be expected .",
    "in addition , based on the strong n overabundance , the na overabundance and the absence of a strong c overabundance , @xcite have speculated that cs 30322 - 023 should be polluted by an agb star , which has a mass of at least 2.0m@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite proposed a theory for the creation of s+r stars .",
    "they suggest that a s+r star is a member of a binary system in which the former primary went through the agb phase . in this stage",
    ", carbon and s - process elements were dumped onto the surface of the companion via mass transfer .",
    "the former primary then evolved into a white dwarf .",
    "mass transfer then occurred in the reverse direction , i.e. , from the companion to the white dwarf , leading in turn to an accretion - induced collapse ( aic ) of the white dwarf into a neutron star .",
    "subsequent r - process nucleosynthesis is then presumed to occur in a neutrino - driven wind of the neutron star , and the nucleosynthesis products contaminate the surface layers of the star that is observed today .",
    "the binary system with lower - mass agb stars ( m@xmath414.0m@xmath13 ) and larger initial orbital separation could not cause aic , because the white dwarf accretes matter insufficiently from the polluted star and the star is polluted only by the agb companion , which can explain the formation of s - only stars .",
    "the r - process component coefficient of cs 30322 - 023 is about 0 , which implies that this star belongs to s - only star . @xcite",
    "have calculated two other s - only stars with @xmath42 and 0.0006 and 10 s+r stars with @xmath43 .",
    "the s - process component coefficient of cs 30322 - 023 is about 0.0002 which is smaller than the other s - rich stars .",
    "this fact illustrates that there is less accreted material of cs 30322 - 023 from the agb companion , and the sample star should be formed in the binary system with a larger initial orbital separation which could not cause aic .",
    "this should be another reason which leads to the special abundance pattern that several neutron - capture elements are deficient with respect to iron , such as sr and y. in addition , the s - process pattern of this star is matched by a model with @xmath44 , which is large enough to be consistent with the idea that the agb star polluting the sample star was of low mass ( m@xmath414.0m@xmath13 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "as a star evolves off the main sequence , its convective envelope penetrates deeper and deeper , reaching into regions where there was previous h burning , and thus undergoes the so - called first dredge - up .",
    "later on , when a star evolves off the red giant branch ( rgb ) , a further mixing episode can take place ( usually referred to as `` extra mixing '' ) .",
    "@xcite have estimated that cs 30322 - 023 is an evolved cemp star .",
    "as such , it would be expected to have passed through the deepest convective envelope stage , i.e. , the amount of accreted material from the former agb star , including c and s - elements such as sr and ba et al .",
    ", is further diluted by the material of the stellar convective envelope , thus decreasing both [ c / fe ] and [ s / fe](``s '' representing a specie of s - process element ) .",
    "although the mixing processes ( first dredge - up and extra mixing ) should have occurred in the sample star , the effect of orbital separation of the binary system above mentioned is expected to be also important .",
    "it is interesting to estimate the dilution effect brought by the orbital separation quantitatively for cs 30322 - 023 with @xmath45 .",
    "the s - process abundances of the sample star are a result of pollution from the dredged - up material of the former agb star .",
    "the measured [ s / fe ] refers to the average s - processed material of the agb star after dilution by mixing with the envelope of the little companion that is now the extrinsic star . at some time on the agb ,",
    "the convective he - shell and the envelope of the giant will be overabundant in heavy element respectively by a factor @xmath46 and @xmath47 with respect to solar system abundances normalized to the value of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the approximate relation between @xmath47 and @xmath46 is @xmath48 where @xmath49@xmath50 is the total mass dredged up from the he - shell into the envelope of the agb star and @xmath51 is the envelope mass of the agb star . for a given s - process element",
    ", the overabundance factor @xmath52 in the future s - enhanced star envelope can be approximately related to the overabundance factor @xmath47 by @xmath53 where @xmath49@xmath54 is the amount of matter accreted by the future s - enhanced star , @xmath55 is the envelope mass of the star .",
    "the component coefficient @xmath26 is computed from the relation @xmath56    for wide binary systems mass transfer operates through stellar winds , rather than by roche - lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "we use the bondi - hoyle accretion rate to calculate the mass being accreted by the sample star , @xcite : @xmath57 ^ 2   \\bigg[\\frac{1}{1+(\\upsilon_{orb}/\\upsilon_{ej})^2}\\bigg]^{\\frac{3}{2}}\\delta m_1 , \\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the semi - major axis of the orbit of the binary system , @xmath10 is a constant expressing the accretion efficiency , and @xmath59 in the situation of interest here according to the detailed hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "@xmath60 is the wind velocity and @xmath61 is the orbital mean velocity .",
    "@xmath62 is the wind mass - loss of the former agb star in a binary system , i.e. , the present white dwarf star .",
    "for the evolved sample star ( @xmath63 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the mass of the convective envelope , @xmath64 , is larger than the main - sequence stars with similar stellar mass . as a result",
    ", the dilution of the accreted material is relatively large and we take @xmath65m@xmath1 @xcite . adopting the formulas ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) and taking @xmath49@xmath66m@xmath1 @xcite , @xmath67 , we can estimate the fraction of the mass captured by the little companion ( @xmath680.8m@xmath1 ) to be about from @xmath69 to @xmath70 of the mass lost by the wind ( 15 km s@xmath31 ) from the former agb star ( @xmath683.0m@xmath1 ) with a period of about @xmath71 yr .",
    "this implies that the sample star , cs 30322 - 023 , should belong to a long - period system , consistent with what is expected that the accretion rate is smaller in wider systems .",
    "because of the uncertainties of mass - loss rates and our poor knowledge of how and when mass transfer phenomena occur , we do not claim that this is the only or even the best understanding of the s - process component coefficient . obviously , long - term radial - velocity monitoring is advisable , possibly leading to the determination of orbital elements for cs 30322 - 023 , which could allow for a further test of our results .",
    "it was also possible to isolate the contributions corresponding to the s- and r - process by our parametric model .",
    "in the sun , the elemental abundances of ba and eu consist of significantly different combinations of s- and r - process isotope contributions , with s : r ratios for ba and eu of 81:19 and 6:94 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the ba and eu abundances are most useful for unraveling the sites and nuclear parameters associated with the s- and r - process correspond to those in extremely metal - poor stars , polluted by material with a few times of nucleosynthetic processing .",
    "we explored the contributions of s- and r - process for these two elements in the sample star . from equation ( 1 )",
    ", we obtained the s : r ratios for ba and eu are 99.6:0.4 and 74.2:25.8 , which are obviously larger than the ratios in the solar system .",
    "the abundances of r - elements , such as eu , in the sample star is lower than those in normal stars , so the sample star seemed to be an `` extremely '' s - only star .",
    "we discuss the uncertainty of the parameters using the method presented by @xcite .",
    "we choose sr as the representative for the first peak elements , ba as the representative for the second peak elements , pb as the representative for the third peak elements and eu as the representative for the r - process elements .",
    "there are two regions in figure 2 , where the region ii is @xmath72 mbarn@xmath31 and @xmath30 with @xmath73 , the region i is @xmath74 mbarn@xmath31 and @xmath75 with @xmath76 , in which all the observed ratios of four representative elements can be accounted for within the error limits . the corresponding mean neutron exposure for the region i and ii are @xmath77 mbarn@xmath31 and @xmath78 mbarn@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "since the final abundance distributions of the s - process nucleosynthesis depend mainly upon the mean neutron exposure @xmath79 , we investigate the relation between the mean neutron exposure @xmath79 and the overlap factor @xmath25 . it is noteworthy that although the values of the overlap factor and the neutron exposure are obviously different for the two regions , indeed , the value of the mean neutron exposure for region i is close to that of region ii .",
    "the uncertainties of the parameters for the star cs 30322 - 023 are similar to those for other metal - poor stars obtained by @xcite .",
    "the star cs 30322 - 023 is an ultra metal - poor lead star which has a special abundance pattern of the neutron - capture elements , i.e. this star shows enhancement of the neutron - capture elements ba and pb , but several neutron - capture elements such as sr and eu are deficient with respect to iron .",
    "the neutron - capture elements abundance pattern could be explained by a binary system which should form in a molecular cloud which had never been polluted by r - process material .",
    "this fact can explain that several neutron - capture elements are deficient with respect to iron , such as eu and sr partly .",
    "the initial mass of the agb companion should be smaller than @xmath0m@xmath1 , which excludes the possibility of forming a type-1.5 supernova , and larger than @xmath2m@xmath1 because of the strong n overabundance and the absence of a strong c overabundance .",
    "the r - process component coefficient of cs 30322 - 023 is very small , which implies that this star is an `` extreme '' s - only stars .",
    "the s - process component coefficient of this star is smaller than the other s - rich stars .",
    "although the mixing processes ( first dredge - up and extra mixing ) should have occurred in the sample star , the effect of orbital separation of the binary system is also important .",
    "the sample star cs 30322 - 023 should belong to a wide binary system where the aic mechanism can not work .",
    "this should be an important reason which leads to the special abundance pattern that several neutron - capture elements are deficient with respect to iron , such as sr , y and eu .",
    "certainly , the possibility that cs 30322 - 023 should be a tp - agb star @xcite is also existent . in this case , the operation of the s - process is associated with thermal pulses occurring on the agb . as a result of the so - called `` third dredge - up ''",
    ", s - process enriched material is brought to the surface of the agb star .",
    "obviously , large uncertainties still remain in this topic , and full understanding of the abundance pattern and evolutionary state of cs 30322 - 023 will depend on future high - resolution studies and long - term radial - velocity monitoring .",
    "more in - depth theoretical and observational studies of s - rich stars will reveal the characteristics of the s - process at low metallicity and the history of enrichment of s- and r - elements in the early galaxy .",
