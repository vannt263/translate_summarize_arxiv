    "nonlinear wave phenomena in periodic media are currently attracting a great deal of research interest in nonlinear optics , bose  einstein condensation and applied mathematics ( see christodoulides _",
    "2003 ; kivshar & agrawal 2003 ; morsch & oberthaler 2006 ; skorobogatiy & yang 2009 ; yang 2010 for reviews ) . apart from scientific curiosity , this research activity is also driven by various potential applications , ranging from light routing in lattice networks ( christodoulides & eugenieva 2001 ) to image transmission through nonlinear media ( yang _ et al . _ 2011 ) .",
    "a characteristic feature of periodic media is the existence of bands in the linear spectrum where linear disturbances , the so - called bloch modes , may propagate . between these bloch bands are bandgaps in which linear disturbances are evanescent but nonlinear localized modes , commonly known as gap solitons , are possible . since the first theoretical prediction ( christodoulides & joseph 1988 ) and experimental observation ( eisenberg _ et al . _ 1998 ) of fundamental solitons in the semi - infinite bandgap of one - dimensional ( 1d ) periodic waveguides , various types of gap solitons in one- and multi - dimensions",
    "have been reported theoretically and experimentally .",
    "examples include 2d fundamental gap solitons , vortex solitons , dipole solitons , reduced - symmetry solitons , vortex - array solitons , truncated - bloch - wave solitons and arbitrary - shape gap solitons ( see yang 2010 for a review ) .",
    "multi - soliton bound states in periodic media have also been constructed in the framework of a discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) model ( kevrekidis _ et al .",
    "in addition , the stability of some of these gap solitons has been examined ( pelinovsky _ et al .",

    "the plethora of gap solitons in periodic media calls for systematic identification and classification of the various types of solutions . on this issue",
    ", some progress has been made , particularly for gap solitons that bifurcate from linear bloch modes at the edges of bloch bands .",
    "specifically , in 1d , only two gap - soliton families bifurcate from each edge of a bloch band under self - focusing or self - defocusing nonlinearity ( neshev _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ; pelinovsky _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; hwang _ et al .",
    "_ 2011 ) , and the positions of these solitons relative to the periodic medium ( or potential ) are determined by a certain recurrence relation ( hwang _ et al .",
    "_ 2011 ) . in 2d ,",
    "four gap - soliton families ( or a multiple of four families ) bifurcate from each edge of a bloch band under self - focusing or self - defocusing nonlinearity ( yang 2010 ) .    however , for the majority of gap solitons , that do not bifurcate from band edges , systematic theoretical treatment is lacking at present .",
    "numerical results indicate that , typically , those solution families feature multiple branches which bifurcate near band edges at small ( but finite ) amplitude ( see yang 2010 and references therein ) , yet there has been no analytical explanation for this phenomenon .    in this article , we employ the nls equation with a spatially periodic potential to analytically construct and classify a broad class of gap solitons that bifurcate away from band edges in 1d periodic media . our approach is based on the observation that the two families of fundamental gap solitons that bifurcate from a band edge can be located only at specific positions relative to the underlying potential ; otherwise , they would be nonlocal owing to the presence of growing tails of exponentially - small amplitude with respect to the peak wave amplitude . however , by piecing together such nonlocal solitary waves , it is possible to construct higher - order gap solitons , or bound states .",
    "the proposed asymptotic theory is illustrated by working out details for bound states involving two nonlocal solitary waves .",
    "we show that a countable set of bound - state families can be constructed .",
    "each family is characterized by the separation distance of the two solitary waves involved , and features three distinct solution branches that bifurcate near band edges .",
    "the analytical predictions are verified by comparison with numerical results .",
    "our study of nonlinear wave phenomena in periodic media is based on the 1d nls equation , @xmath0 with a periodic potential @xmath1 and self - focusing ( @xmath2 ) or self - defocusing ( @xmath3 ) cubic nonlinearity .",
    "this equation is the appropriate mathematical model for bose ",
    "einstein condensates loaded in optical lattices ( dalfovo _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ; morsch & oberthaler 2006 ) and laser beam transmission in photonic lattices under the paraxial approximation ( yang 2010 ) .",
    "although it is possible to consider a general periodic potential @xmath1 as in hwang _",
    "( 2011 ) , here , for simplicity , we shall work with the sinusoidal potential @xmath4 which is @xmath5-periodic and also symmetric in @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the potential depth .",
    "this potential frequently arises in nonlinear optics and bose ",
    "einstein condensates .",
    "solitary - wave solutions of are sought in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the propagation constant , and the amplitude function @xmath10 is real - valued and localized in space . inserting ( [ soliton_form ] ) into , we find that @xmath10 satisfies @xmath11 for infinitesimal solutions @xmath10 , the nonlinear term in the above equation drops out .",
    "the resulting linear version of is a mathieu - type equation and , by the bloch ",
    "floquet theory , its wave spectrum features a band  gap structure .",
    "specifically , the linear version of admits two linearly independent solutions in the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 being @xmath5-periodic in @xmath6 .",
    "the wave character of these so - called bloch modes hinges on whether the corresponding wavenumber @xmath14 is real or complex . by requiring @xmath14 to be real",
    ", one then obtains an infinite number of bloch bands for @xmath9 in which the bloch modes propagate .",
    "these propagation bands are separated by gaps , where @xmath14 turns out to be complex , implying evanescent behaviour .    at the edges of bloch bands , where the modes switch from propagating to evanescent , two bloch modes in the band collide at either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , and",
    "a single real - valued bloch mode that is either @xmath5- or @xmath17-periodic , arises there .",
    "this suggests that edges of bloch bands are possible bifurcation points of solitary - wave solutions of the nonlinear equation .",
    "these solitary waves reside inside band gaps and are the so - called gap solitary waves ( or gap solitons ) .",
    "the bifurcation of 1d gap solitons from band edges was discussed by pelinovsky _",
    "( 2004 ) using a multiple - scale expansion in powers of the wave amplitude , along with a certain constraint obeyed by locally confined solutions of .",
    "they identified two families of gap solitons that bifurcate from each band edge , namely ` on - site ' and ` off - site ' solitons , depending on whether the soliton is centred at a minimum or maximum of the sinusoidal potential .",
    "more recently , hwang _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) re - visited the problem of small - amplitude gap solitons near band edges , taking a different approach , that is applicable for a general potential @xmath1 . rather than the constraint utilized in pelinovsky _",
    "( 2004 ) , hwang _",
    "( 2011 ) focused on the behaviour of the tails of bloch - wave packets .",
    "these tails are controlled by the coupling of the wave envelope to the periodic bloch mode at the band edge , an effect that lies beyond all orders of the usual multiple - scale expansion in powers of the wave amplitude .",
    "( 2011 ) carried this expansion beyond all orders using techniques of exponential asymptotics ( yang &  akylas 1997 ) , for the case of bloch - wave packets whose envelope features a single hump .",
    "it turns out that the tails of such wave packets decay as @xmath18 , and hence gap solitons arise , only for two specific locations of the wave envelope relative to the underlying periodic potential .",
    "both these soliton families bifurcate from the linear ( infinitesimal ) periodic bloch mode at a band edge , and they coincide with the on - site and off - site gap solitons found by pelinovsky _",
    "( 2004 ) in the case of a symmetric periodic potential .    in the present work , making use of the asymptotic expressions derived in hwang",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) for the tails of a single - hump block - wave packet , we shall construct small - amplitude gap - soliton families , in the form of bound states , that comprise two or more such wave packets .",
    "in contrast to the so - called fundamental gap solitons found in pelinovsky _",
    "( 2004 ) and hwang _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) , these higher - order soliton families bifurcate at small but finite amplitude close to a band edge , and they feature multiple branches that do not connect to fundamental soliton families or band edges .    in preparation for the ensuing analysis , we now summarize the main results of the multiple - scale perturbation procedure for a single - hump bloch - wave packet ( pelinovsky _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; hwang _ et al .",
    "close to a band edge @xmath19 , say , gap solitons are expected to be weakly nonlinear bloch - wave packets .",
    "the solution to equation is expanded in powers of an amplitude parameter , @xmath20 , @xmath21 along with @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the ` slow ' variable of the envelope function @xmath27 . by imposing the appropriate solvability condition at @xmath28 ,",
    "it turns out that @xmath27 satisfies the stationary nls equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 the well - known soliton solution of ( [ e : nlsenvelope ] ) is @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the position of the peak of the envelope .",
    "this solution exists provided @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; the first of these conditions requires @xmath9 to lie in the interior of the band gap , while the second condition can be met in the presence of self - focusing ( @xmath2 ) nonlinearity if @xmath36 , or self - defocusing ( @xmath3 ) nonlinearity if @xmath37 .",
    "it is important to note that the envelope equation is translation - invariant , and @xmath38 is a free parameter in the solution . as a result , gap solitons of equation",
    "could be obtained regardless of the position of the envelope relative to the underlying periodic potential .",
    "this conclusion would seem rather suspicious , though , given that the original amplitude equation is _ not _ translation - invariant .",
    "this issue was recognized by pelinovsky _",
    "( 2004 ) , who pointed out that locally confined solutions of must obey the constraint @xmath39 which can be readily obtained by multiplying with @xmath40 and integrating with respect to @xmath6 . upon inserting the perturbation solution and the potential into",
    ", this condition then restricts the peak of the envelope to be at either a minimum ( @xmath41 ) or a maximum ( @xmath42 ) of the potential , corresponding to on - site or off - site gap solitons , respectively .",
    "it is also worth noting that the so - called melnikov function @xmath43 in , which depends on the shift @xmath44 of the envelope relative to the potential @xmath1 , is exponentially small with respect to @xmath45 ; hence , the constraint ( [ e : melnikov ] ) for possible locations of gap solitons hinges upon information beyond all orders of the two - scale expansion .",
    "another way of reconciling the two - scale expansion with the fact that gap solitons can be placed only at specific locations relative to the potential @xmath1 , is by examining the behaviour of the tails of bloch - wave packets near a band edge . assuming that they have infinitesimal amplitude , these tails are governed by the linear version of equation .",
    "hence , for @xmath9 inside a band gap and close to the edge @xmath46 , using the same notation as in and , the asymptotic representation of @xmath47 away from the solitary - wave core is , generically , a linear combination of two evanescent bloch modes @xmath48 to leading order in @xmath49 .",
    "as expected , the slow exponential growth / decay of these modes is consistent with the behaviour of the tails of the envelope function @xmath27 according to the steady nls equation .",
    "now , for the purpose of constructing a solitary - wave solution of , the left - hand tail must involve only @xmath50 , @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 as @xmath53 . for generic values of @xmath54 , when one integrates equation ( [ e : nlsamp ] ) from this left - hand tail to the right - hand side , the right - hand tail would involve both @xmath55 and @xmath50 , @xmath56 so @xmath10 is not locally confined . however , the amplitude @xmath57 of the growing tail in ( [ e : righthand ] ) is exponentially small with respect to @xmath45 ( see below ) , and hence this tail can not be captured by an expansion in powers of @xmath45 , such as .",
    "only when @xmath54 takes certain special values can the growing - tail amplitude @xmath57 vanish , resulting in a true solitary wave solution .",
    "this restriction on @xmath54 is consistent with the integral constraint utilized by pelinovsky _",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "hwang _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) computed the amplitude @xmath57 by carrying expansion beyond all orders of @xmath45 for a general periodic potential @xmath1 , utilizing an exponential - asymptotics procedure in the wavenumber domain ( akylas &  yang 1995 ; yang &  akylas 1997 ) . according to this revised perturbation analysis ,",
    "@xmath57 , which indeed is exponentially small with respect to @xmath45 , does vanish for two specific positions of the envelope relative to the underlying potential , thus furnishing two families of gap solitons that bifurcate at the band edge .",
    "for the symmetric periodic potential , in particular , @xmath57 vanishes when the peak of the envelope is placed at @xmath41 or @xmath42 , corresponding to the on - site and off - site gap solitons , as was obtained earlier by pelinovsky _",
    "( 2004 ) .    as the details of the exponential - asymptotics procedure",
    "are rather involved , we shall only quote the main results . when the peak of the envelope is not at a minimum or maximum of the potential ( @xmath58 ) , the resulting ` solitary ' waves are nonlocal owing to the presence of both growing and decaying solutions in at least one of the tails . specifically , assuming that the left - hand tail is locally confined in accordance with and ,    [ e : updownstream ] @xmath59 the right - hand tail features a growing component of exponentially - small amplitude with respect to @xmath45 , in addition to a decaying component analogous to : @xmath60    note that the amplitude of the growing tail in is proportional to a constant @xmath61 . as explained in hwang _",
    "( 2011 ) , this constant is determined from solving a certain recurrence relation that contains information beyond all orders of expansion .",
    "in particular , @xmath62 for the sinusoidal potential ( [ e : potential ] ) .",
    "as expected , the growing component of the right - hand tail is absent when @xmath63 .    by utilizing the symmetries of equation",
    "as noted below , it is straightforward to deduce from the asymptotic behaviour of nonlocal solitary waves whose right - hand tail is locally confined ,    [ e : downupstream ] @xmath64 but the left - hand tail comprises a growing and a decaying component : @xmath65    for the symmetric potential ( [ e : potential ] ) , equation ( [ e : nlsamp ] ) is invariant with respect to reflection in @xmath6 @xmath66 , and the bloch wave @xmath67 at a band edge is either symmetric or antisymmetric in @xmath6 , @xmath68 . since ( [ e : nlsamp ] ) is also invariant with respect to @xmath69 , the reflected solution @xmath70 may thus be written as ( [ e : downupstream ] ) for both symmetric and antisymmetric @xmath67 .",
    "the asymptotic expressions and for the tails of nonlocal solitary waves are key to constructing new families of locally confined solutions , in the form of bound states , as discussed below .",
    "as indicated above , gap solitons in the form of bloch - wave packets with the ` sech ' envelope arise only when the peak of the envelope is at a minimum ( @xmath41 ) or a maximum ( @xmath42 ) of the potential . apart from these fundamental soliton states , it is possible , however , to construct other gap - soliton families by piecing together two or more of the nonlocal solitary waves found in ",
    "[ s : nonlocalwaves ] .",
    "the overall strategy for determining these so - called bound states is similar to that followed in yang & akylas ( 1997 ) for constructing multi - packet solitary - wave solutions of the fifth - order kdv equation . here , we shall work out the details of finding bound states involving two bloch - wave packets .",
    "consider two nonlocal solitary - wave solutions , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , whose ` sech'-profile envelope functions are centred at @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , with @xmath75 . in addition , let @xmath76 as @xmath77 , so the right - hand tail of @xmath72 and the left - hand tail of @xmath71 are nonlocal .",
    "let us define the separation between the solitary - wave cores of the two constituent nonlocal waves as @xmath78 then , assuming @xmath79 , and are legitimate asymptotic expressions for these tails in the ` overlap ' region @xmath80 . specifically , according to , the right - hand tail of @xmath72 is given by @xmath81 and , according to , the left - hand tail of @xmath71 reads @xmath82 note that the upper sign in corresponds to the case where the envelopes of the two solitary waves have the same polarity ( sign ) , while the lower sign pertains to the case of opposite polarity .",
    "now , in order for these two nonlocal solitary waves to form a bound state , their growing and decaying tail components must match smoothly in the overlap region between the two main cores . based on and",
    ", this requires @xmath83 and , for this matching condition to be met , it is necessary that @xmath84 clearly , owing to the growing exponential @xmath85 on the left - hand side of , this constraint can not be satisfied for @xmath86 when @xmath87 is finite . as a result",
    ", solution families of bound states are expected to bifurcate at a finite amplitude @xmath88 , say , depending on the separation distance @xmath87 .",
    "below , we shall verify this claim and compute @xmath89 for the various solution branches .",
    "attention is now focused on the matching condition , in order to delineate the solution branches of bound states that bifurcate close to a band edge .",
    "consider first the case where the two nonlocal solitary waves have envelopes with the same polarity .",
    "then , the upper sign applies in , and @xmath90 .",
    "this condition can be satisfied in two ways :    [ e : cond1 ] @xmath91    where @xmath92 , @xmath93 are integers and @xmath94 .",
    "accordingly , the solitary - wave separation corresponding to these two possibilities is @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , the matching condition reads @xmath97 with @xmath87 given by ( i ) and ( ii ) in .",
    "it is convenient to label families of bound states by the integer @xmath98 which , in view of , controls the separation between the two nonlocal solitary waves that form the bound states .",
    "as noted earlier , the present theory assumes that these solitary waves are well - separated , namely , @xmath79 , which in turn requires @xmath99 ; the validity of this condition will be verified later in this section .    in preparation for tracing the solution branches of the family of bound states corresponding to a given @xmath98 , we write @xmath100 with @xmath101 , so that from , we have @xmath102 where @xmath103 . the matching condition , with @xmath87 given by ( i ) and ( ii ) above",
    ", then leads to the following two conditions , respectively ,    [ e : conditioncosine ] @xmath104    where @xmath105 based on equations , given @xmath45 , one may find the values of @xmath106 , and from the corresponding separations @xmath87 , for which bound states are possible .    specifically , from equation , it is easy to see that two values of @xmath106 arise for each @xmath45 above a certain threshold , @xmath107 , which is the bifurcation point of the bound states obeying .",
    "this threshold is associated with a double root , @xmath108 , of equation , where @xmath109 from this equation and ( [ e : conditioncosinea ] ) , it follows that @xmath110 inserting this result into , @xmath107 then is found by solving @xmath111    .",
    "two branches ( solid blue ) are obtained from solving and one branch ( dashed red ) from solving .",

    "therefore , describes only one solution branch . for @xmath121 , in particular , @xmath122 , and",
    "this solution branch approaches a limiting bound - state configuration that , according to , involves an on - site and an off - site solitary wave .",
    "we remark that the double root @xmath123 of for @xmath124 is also a solution of for the same value of @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the solution branch bifurcates from the point @xmath125 on the lower branch of the solutions , which themselves bifurcate at @xmath107 , as illustrated schematically in figure [ f : delta_curve ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the bound - state family corresponding to a certain @xmath98 comprises three distinct solution branches which are connected with each other .",
    "the bifurcation points , @xmath107 and @xmath113 , do not coincide ; but when @xmath98 is large , they are close to each other . indeed , in the limit @xmath126 , it can be readily shown , using , and , that @xmath127 .",
    "thus , for large solitary - wave separation ( @xmath126 ) , bound - state families bifurcate near a band edge , but never exactly at the band edge itself .",
    "moreover , this scaling of @xmath107 and @xmath113 in terms of @xmath98 is consistent with the condition @xmath99 imposed earlier for the purpose of matching the tails ( [ e : psiminus ] ) and ( [ e : psiplus ] ) of nonlocal solitary waves forming a bound state .",
    "we now consider the case when the two nonlocal solitary waves participating in a bound state have envelopes with opposite polarity , and the lower sign in applies .",
    "hence , @xmath128",
    ". this condition can be satisfied in two ways :    [ e : cond2 ] @xmath129    for some integers @xmath130 and @xmath94 . as a result ,",
    "the expressions for the solitary - wave separation @xmath131 are also valid here , so the matching condition gives rise to the same equations that describe the solution branches @xmath132 of bound states belonging to the family labelled by @xmath96 , where @xmath133 as before .",
    "specifically , for a given @xmath98 , the three solution branches found earlier arise in this instance as well : two of these branches bifurcate at @xmath134 and , in the limit @xmath135 , represent bound states with both solitary waves being on - site ( @xmath136 ) or off - site ( @xmath137 ) . marching along this solution curve from the on - site branch to the off - site branch , @xmath106 increases from @xmath138 to @xmath139 , and , in view of ( [ e : cond2a ] ) , the separation distance @xmath87 of the two nonlocal solitary waves increases from @xmath140 to @xmath141 .",
    "( this transition behaviour is also brought out by the numerical results presented in  6 ; see figure [ f : opposite_polarity ] . )",
    "this transition contrasts with the case of same envelope polarity examined earlier , where the separation distance @xmath87 of the two nonlocal solitary waves decreases from @xmath141 to @xmath140 when marching along the solution curve from the on - site branch to the off - site branch .",
    "finally , according to , and , the third solution branch bifurcates at @xmath124 and , for @xmath142 , represents bound states with one solitary wave on - site and the other off - site .",
    "moreover , it follows from that , in the course of continuation of the bound - state solution from the on - site branch to this mixed - site branch , one of the two on - site solitary waves remains on - site and does not move , while the other on - site solitary wave moves away and becomes off - site .",
    "in applications , gap - soliton solution branches are often described through @xmath143 which is commonly referred to as the soliton power .",
    "this quantity is also key to understanding the stability properties of gap solitons ( vakhitov & kolokolov 1973 ; shi _ et al .",
    "_ 2008 ; yang 2010 ) . here , we shall derive an analytical expression for the power of small - amplitude bound states near band edges , and trace the solution branches found earlier in terms of @xmath144 .",
    "the theoretical predictions will be compared against numerical results in  [ s : numerical ] .    by virtue of perfect matching of the tails and in the overlap region @xmath80 , one may write the following uniformly valid approximation to bound states involving two nonlocal solitary waves ( to the leading order ) : @xmath145 here again the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to the case where the envelopes of the solitary waves have the same ( opposite ) polarity .",
    "inserting into , the power associated with a bound state may then be approximated as @xmath146 where @xmath147    the integrals above can be evaluated by substituting the fourier series @xmath148 for the even @xmath5-periodic function @xmath149 , into and and then integrating term - by - term .",
    "specifically , in the limit @xmath150 , @xmath151 , we find @xmath152 from , however , it is clear that @xmath153 ; hence , the second term in is sub - dominant in comparison to , and yields the following asymptotic expression for @xmath144 , @xmath154 with @xmath155    consider first the case of bound states comprising two solitary waves with envelopes of the same polarity , where the upper sign in applies . corresponding to the first possibility for @xmath87 in , there are two bound - state solution branches , @xmath132 , governed by , and the associated power according to is @xmath156 where @xmath157 as before . on the other hand , corresponding to the second possibility for @xmath87 in , there is only one solution branch , given by , and its power is @xmath158 in both and , the second term in the brackets derives from the interaction of the tails of the nonlocal solitary waves .",
    "moreover , it should be kept in mind that these expressions are valid when @xmath159 and @xmath160 ; i.e. , close to the band edge and for wide separation of the two solitary waves forming a bound state .",
    "based on the asymptotic formulae and , it is possible to deduce the qualitative behaviour of the power curves .",
    "we recall that , for bound states of solitary waves with the same envelope polarity , @xmath106 decreases from @xmath139 to @xmath138 as the solution curve is traversed from the on - site to the off - site branch . since , for given @xmath45 , the power is a decreasing function of @xmath106 ( for @xmath161 ) , the power on the off - site branch is then always higher than the power on the on - site branch .",
    "similarly , one can see that the power of the mixed - site solution branch always lies between the powers of the on - site and off - site braches .",
    "hence , the power curve associated with a bound - state solution family involving solitary waves of the same polarity , is such that the on - site branch is always the lower - power branch , the mixed - site branch lies in the middle and the off - site branch is the higher - power branch . also , in the @xmath162 plane , the middle solution branch bifurcates from the lower ( off - site ) branch ( see figure 1 ) ; thus , on the power curve , the intermediate - power ( mixed - site ) branch bifurcates from the higher - power ( off - site ) branch .",
    "these general features of the power curves will be verified numerically in @xmath1636 ( see figures 2 and 5 ) .",
    "next , in the case of bound states with nonlocal solitary waves having envelopes of opposite polarity , where the lower sign in applies , a similar calculation based on , along with , yields @xmath164 for the two solution branches bifurcating at @xmath107 , and @xmath165 for the single solution branch bifurcating at @xmath113 . based on these power formulae , it is again possible to show that , on the associated power curve , the on - site branch is the lower - power branch , the mixed - site branch is the immediate - power branch , and the off - site branch is the higher - power branch , just as in the case of same envelope polarity above .",
    "however , the intermediate - power branch now bifurcates from the lower - power branch , which is the opposite of the conclusion reached earlier in the same - envelope - polarity case .",
    "these theoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical results below ( see figure [ f : opposite_polarity ] ) .",
