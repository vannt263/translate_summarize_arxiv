    "important clues about spiral galaxy formation lie in the nature of their central bulges .",
    "there are two main stellar systems called @xmath7bulges@xmath7 in the current literature : a ) _ classical bulges _ , characterized by an old stellar population , dynamically supported by velocity dispersion , less flat than disks and featureless ; b ) _ disk  like _ or _ pseudo  bulges _ @xcite , more flattened and rotationally supported than classical bulges , contain more dust and some show recent star formation ( sf ) .",
    "pseudobulges can contain substructures such as bars , rings and spiral arms .",
    "surface brightness profiles of pseudobulges and classical bulges have srsic index @xcite n@xmath0@xmath82 and n@xmath0@xmath92 respectively with little to no overlap @xcite .",
    "different scenarios have been proposed for the formation of classical bulges and pseudobulges .",
    "classical bulges are thought to form , as elliptical galaxies , in a rapid and/or violent process .",
    "this picture includes both the monolithic collapse @xcite and merger scenarios @xcite .",
    "however , pseudobulges are thought to grow slowly via redistribution of disk material augmented by gas accretion and other secular processes . giant clumps of intense sf have been observed in high redshift spiral galaxies .",
    "gravitational instabilities have been proposed to build bulges via clump migration @xcite , but the type of bulge remains unclear .",
    "optical colors of galaxies reflect mainly their stellar populations .",
    "the distribution of galaxy colors in the ( g@xmath10r ) vs. ( u@xmath10 g ) plane @xcite shows a clear separation into red and blue sequences , corresponding roughly to early ( e , s0 , and sa ) and late  type ( sb , sc , and irr ) galaxies , as expected from the respective dominance of old and young stellar populations .",
    "since pseudobulges are thought to grow from disk material , they presumably preserve some memory of their disky origin .",
    "@xcite found a sf rate in pseudobulges similar to those found in the disks of their host galaxies ( not environmentally selected ) , interpreting this result to be consistent with pseudobulge stellar mass growth via moderate sf .",
    "in this context the stellar population in pseudobulges should be younger and bluer than in classical bulges / elliptical galaxies .",
    "the question is , of course , how much bluer ?",
    "existing bibliography on bulge colors @xcite , does not target especifically isolated galaxies , which should best reflect their origins because of their minimized environmental evolutionary effects .",
    "this letter presents a study of bulge colors in the amiga sample of galaxies .",
    "this sample contains predominantly ( @xmath566@xmath11 ) late  type spirals with small bulges , and represents a fruitful sample to explore colors of bulges for galaxies near their primordial state ( minimal merger / accretion / tidal effects ) . throughout this article , the concordance cosmology with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "is assumed .",
    "the amiga sample is based on a refinement of the catalogue of isolated galaxies ( cig ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where two complementary isolation parameters were defined to select the most isolated galaxies in the cig : the tidal force ( q@xmath15 ) and the local number density ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the isolation parameters have been recently improved for the 636 amiga galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "we selected 298 spiral ( t=18 ) galaxies from the complete amiga ",
    "sdss sample with recession velocities v@xmath17@xmath11500 km / s ( median @xmath18 7000 km / s ) and isolation parameters q@xmath15@xmath2 - 2 and @xmath192.7 , which ensures that the galaxies have been unperturbed by mayor neighbours in the last 5 gyr .",
    "we downloaded the images of these galaxies from the sdss ",
    "iii ( dr8 * ? ? ?",

    "* ) in gri bands . in a few cases two or more frames were combined using the iraf task imcombine .",
    "nineteen galaxies were rejected because a bad combination of the images ( 2 ) or a close saturated star ( 17 ) .",
    "the final sample is composed of 279 isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "total magnitudes were derived using sextractor in the _ gri _ bands .",
    "the magnitudes were corrected applying the galactic dust extinction computed by sdss following @xcite , and the k  correction computed using the code kcorrect @xcite .",
    "structural modeling of galaxy bulges was performed using the galfit package @xcite applied to the i  band sdss images .",
    "we fit a srsic function to the bulges and an exponential function to the disks .",
    "we identified visually galaxies hosting a bar using the i  band and color images of sdss and in these cases we fit an additional srsic function for this component . in all cases ,",
    "the model was convolved with a point ",
    "spread function ( psf ) generated from the sdss psfield .    since the fit depends strongly in the input values , we fitted each galaxy with a variety of initial values , inspecting the results and accepting a fit if the median of the residuals in the 5x5 innermost pixels was lower than 10% .",
    "this was achieved for 189 galaxies , which form our sample hereinafter ( 45@xmath11 barred ) .",
    "four galaxies ( the three sdm and one sd ) show no bulge .",
    "eight galaxies show signs of interaction and their disks could not be properly fitted .",
    "four galaxies are affected by a star in the central part and 24 ( most of them highly inclined ) show dust lines in their centers which confuse the galfit bulge fit . finally , 50 galaxies present residuals larger than the 10% of the flux in the innermost region , mostly caused by unreliable parameters in the fit that could not be solved with any set of initial parameters tested . in the g and r bands ,",
    "the fits were done using the i  band parameters leaving free the magnitudes of the components and the disk scale lenght .",
    "we compare this metodology with the free fit in g and r  bands .",
    "the parameters obtained for the disk are very stable , with a difference in magnitude lower than 0.01 for 80% of the cases .",
    "differences in bulge parameters are larger although classification based in srsic index ( see below ) would change for only 5@xmath11 of the galaxies . further discussion and details will be presented in a follow up paper .",

    "<S> we present structural parameters and ( g  i ) bulge / disk colors for a large sample ( 189 ) of isolated amiga galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the structural parameters of bulges were derived from the 2d bulge / disk / bar decomposition of sdss i  band images using galfit . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies were separated between classical bulges ( n@xmath0@xmath12.5 ) and pseudobulges ( n@xmath0@xmath22.5 ) , resulting in a dominant pseudobulge population ( 94% ) with only 12 classical bulges . in the @xmath2@xmath3@xmath1r@xmath4 plane , pseudobulges are distributed below the elliptical relation ( smaller r@xmath4 and fainter @xmath3 ) , with the closest region to the kormendy relation populated by those pseudobulges with larger values of b / t . </S>",
    "<S> we derived ( g  i ) bulge colors using aperture photometry and find that pseudobulges show median colors ( g  i)@xmath0@xmath51.06 , while their associated disks are much bluer , ( g  i)@xmath6@xmath50.77 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , 64% ( 113/177 ) of pseudobulges follow the red sequence of early  type galaxies . bluer pseudobulges tend to be located in galaxies with the highest likelihood of tidal perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the red bulge colors and low b / t values for amiga isolated galaxies are consistent with an early formation epoch and not much subsequent growth . </S>",
    "<S> properties of bulges in isolated galaxies contrast with a picture where pseudobulges grow continuosly via star formation . </S>",
    "<S> they also suggest that environment could be playing a role in rejuvenating the pseudobulges . </S>"
