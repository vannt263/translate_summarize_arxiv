    "the charge - density - wave ( cdw ) , first predicted by peierls for one - dimensional interacting electron gas systems @xcite , is a prototype example of collective state , which , similarly to superconductivity , belongs to the class of broken - symmetry ground state .",
    "two prominent energy scales characterize their electrodynamic response : the collective phason mode and the single - particle gap ( 2@xmath3 ) excitation @xcite .",
    "the former mode is centered at zero frequency with vanishing width in the absorption spectrum of a superconductor , while in the cdw state the interaction between the condensate and the lattice imperfections shifts the mode to finite frequency , with the center ( pinning ) frequency usually well below the gap energy @xcite . for a superconductor ,",
    "both collective and single particle excitations are possible and the relative strength of each depends on the ratio @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the coherence length and @xmath6 is the mean free path . on the other hand , for cdw s the collective mode spectral weight depends on @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dynamical mass associated with the cdw and @xmath9 the band mass . the remaining spectral weight , 1-@xmath7 , is associated with single particle transitions across the gap and , due to the prominent role played by the phonons ( @xmath10 ) , most of the total spectral weight resides with the single particle excitations .",
    "generally the two modes in the cdw state are well separated and each can be observed by measuring the conductivity @xmath11 over a broad spectral range . with transition temperatures on the order of 100 k ,",
    "mean - field theory gives @xmath12 of the order of 100 - 1000 @xmath13 , in the infrared range of frequencies , while the pinned mode resonance usually occurs in the millimeter wave spectral range in nominally pure specimens .",
    "another issue of general relevance in materials with strongly anisotropic properties concerns the role played by fluctuation effects @xcite .",
    "the mean - field solution of an ideal one - dimensional system leads to a finite transition temperature @xmath14 where long - range order develops and the system undergoes the peierls transition to the cdw ground state .",
    "this , however , is an artifact of the mean - field approximation , which neglects the role played by fluctuations of the order parameter ( i.e. , the cdw gap ) .",
    "real quasi - one - dimensional materials are highly anisotropic three - dimensional systems with interchain electronic coulomb interactions and tunneling , leading to coupling of the fluctuations that develop along each chain .",
    "this coupling results in a finite transition temperature @xmath15 below which three - dimensional long - range order occurs . for weak interchain coupling ,",
    "@xmath15 is significantly smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "the region below @xmath14 is characterized by one - dimensional fluctuations which , at some temperature @xmath16 , cross over to fluctuations with two- or three - dimensional character .",
    "@xmath17 is the temperature at which the transverse correlation length @xmath18 becomes indeed comparable to the interchain spacing .",
    "the higher is the dimensionality of the interacting electron gas the smaller is the temperature interval where fluctuations occur .",
    "these features pertaining to the cdw phase transition have been by now thoroughly explored and well established in the frequency dependent optical conductivity @xmath19 of quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain - like materials @xcite . in 1d systems , the instability induced by the peierls transition @xcite reflects furthermore a strong enhancement of the static electronic susceptibility , which develops at selected wavevectors spanning the fermi surface ( i.e. , the so - called fermi surface ( fs ) nesting at @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the fermi wavevector ) .",
    "evidences for the cdw state were also found in higher dimensions , specifically in novel two - dimensional ( 2d ) layered compounds @xcite .",
    "the 2d nature of the crystallographic structure leads to anisotropic physical properties and approximately cylindrical fss .",
    "obviously , the fs - driven cdw instabilities are generally weaker in 2d than in 1d systems .",
    "nevertheless , under particular nesting conditions the electronic susceptibility can be sufficiently enhanced even in 2d for a cdw to develop . at variance with the 1d case however ,",
    "2d materials remain metallic in the presence of the cdw , since energy gaps can only open at discrete points of the fs .",
    "the persistence of such a metallic character in the broken - symmetry ground state also screens any signature of the collective mode in the electrodynamic response .",
    "the understanding of layered correlated systems recently regained a lot of importance , because of the variety of correlations acting and of the instabilities occurring in 2d systems , the primary example of which is the high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates . in this context , a family of layered compounds which have attracted a lot of attention recently are the rare - earth ( @xmath22 ) tri - tellurides @xmath22te@xmath0 , first studied by dimasi et al",
    ". @xcite . their crystallographic structure with space group @xmath23 @xcite",
    "is made up of te bilayers and insulating corrugated @xmath22te slabs which act as charge reservoirs for the te planes ( inset fig .",
    "@xmath22te@xmath0 host an @xmath24 , incommensurate cdw already well above room temperature for all @xmath22 elements lighter than dy @xcite , while in the heavy rare - earth tri - tellurides ( i.e. , @xmath22=tm , er , ho , dy ) the corresponding transition temperature , @xmath1 , lies below @xmath25300 k and decreases with increasing @xmath22 mass . in the latter systems , a further transition to a @xmath26 cdw state occurs at @xmath2 , ranging from 180 k for tmte@xmath0 to 50 k for dyte@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "recent angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) data @xcite suggest that as the rare - earth ion is varied , the second cdw is formed only when the first cdw weakens with decreasing lattice parameters , making larger fs - segments available for the new nesting conditions to form @xcite .",
    "this second cdw modulation is along a direction perpendicular to the first one .",
    "the drastic change in transition temperatures @xmath1 with the size of the @xmath22 ion or externally applied pressure on a given material @xcite is accompanied by a similarly large change in the properties of the cdw itself .",
    "in particular , the cdw gap of the lighter @xmath22te@xmath0 was shown to progressively collapse when the lattice constant is equivalently reduced either by chemical or applied pressure , which , in turn , induces a transfer of spectral weight into the metallic component of the excitation spectrum @xcite , the latter resulting from the fact that the fs in these 2d materials is indeed only partially gapped by the formation of the cdw .    here",
    ", we focus our attention on hote@xmath0 and erte@xmath0 , as representative members of the heavy rare - earth tri - tellurides with transition temperatures into the uni- and bidirectional cdw states both below 300 k. this allows us to have access to the temperature dependence of the relevant energy scales ( e.g. , the cdw gaps ) , on which very little is known so far . from a broader perspective , we will compare the temperature dependence of the cdw phase transition with the previously studied @xcite impact of the lattice compression and of the pressure induced dimensionality crossover on the cdw formation .",
    "furthermore , it is still widely debated to which extent fluctuations affect the cdw phase transition of the interacting electron gas in dimensions higher than one .",
    "another goal of this work is thus to investigate the role played by the fluctuation effects with respect to the cdw phase transitions .",

    "the hote@xmath0 and erte@xmath0 single crystals were grown by slow cooling a binary melt , as described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the plate - like crystals , removed from the melt by decanting in a centrifuge , could be readily cleaved between te layers to reveal clean surfaces for the reflectivity measurements .",

    "distinct anomalies signal the cdw phase transitions at @xmath1= 265 and 288 k and at @xmath2= 157 and 110 k for erte@xmath0 and hote@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the overall trend of @xmath32 with decreasing temperature reinforces the notion that these materials remain metallic down to low temperatures and thus that only a fraction of the fs is affected by the cdw transitions .",
    "we exploit several spectrometers and interferometers , in order to measure the optical reflectivity @xmath33 as a function of temperature ( 4 - 300 k ) for all samples from the far infrared ( 6 mev ) up to the ultraviolet ( 6 ev ) spectral range , with light polarized parallel to the te planes . dedicated optical cryostats with appropriate windows for the mid- and far - infrared range were employed .",
    "it is worth noting that data as a function of temperature in the mid - infrared range were collected with an infrared - microscope , which allowed us to investigate the optical response at several selected spots on the sample surface , therefore testing the degree of homogeneity of our samples .",
    "it turns out that our samples are very homogenous so that data collected on different spots are equivalent to each other .",

    "this feature will be later ascribed to the onset of the single particle excitation across the cdw gap .",
    "its opening seems to continuously evolve with decreasing temperature , without any abrupt changes when crossing over from the undirectional cdw state below @xmath1 to the bidirectional one at @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , we do see a remarkable enhancement of @xmath33 at low temperatures ( i.e. , @xmath3850 k ) , as consequence of the sharp onset and somehow steeper increase of @xmath33 below the depletion at 3000 @xmath13 ( fig . 2a and 2c ) .",

    "the thin dashed lines at 300 and 10 k in both panels correspond to the resulting total lorentz - drude fit ( see text ) . in panel ( b ) the fit components are shown with dashed - dotted lines at 10 k.,width=309 ]    exploring such a large spectral range allows us to perform reliable kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformations in order to achieve the optical functions . to this end",
    ", @xmath33 was extended towards zero frequency ( i.e. , @xmath420 ) with the hagen - rubens extrapolation ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 being the @xmath30 conductivity , fig . 1 @xcite ) and with standard power - laws ( i.e. , @xmath45 , 2@xmath464 ) at high frequencies @xcite .",
    "the overall view of the real part @xmath11 of the complex optical conductivity at two selected temperatures , above and well below @xmath1 and @xmath2 , is shown for both compounds in fig .",
    "2b and 2d .",
    "figures 3b and 4b then highlight @xmath11 in the infrared energy interval . upon lowering the temperature",
    "we first observe a narrowing of the zero - energy resonance , ascribed to the effective metallic ( drude ) contribution to the absorption spectrum .",
    "contrary to the 1d materials , where the cdw phase transition leads to an insulating state @xcite , the metallic part in @xmath11 of 2d materials overcasts the collective mode , making any attempts for its observation by infrared absorption methods impossible .",
    "hand in hand with the narrowing of the metallic component there is the appearance of a pronounced mid - infrared feature , peaked at about 3000 @xmath13 and which obviously pairs with the depletion seen in @xmath33 at about the same energy ( fig . 3a and 4a ) .",
    "the @xmath11 spectra as a function of temperature on hote@xmath0 and erte@xmath0 do share common features with our previous data upon lattice compression on the @xmath22te@xmath0 series @xcite .",
    "( a ) and @xmath11 ( b ) in the infrared energy interval for hote@xmath0 .",
    "all spectra have been shifted for clarity by a constant value ( in @xmath33 by 10% and in @xmath11 by 1.5x10@xmath39 @xmath40cm)@xmath41 ) .",
    "the thin dashed lines at 300 and 10 k in both panels correspond to the resulting total lorentz - drude fit ( see text ) . in panel ( b ) the fit components are shown with dashed - dotted lines at 10 k.,width=309 ]    higher energy excitations , corresponding to the spectral features observed in @xmath33 above the plasma edge , are ascribed to electronic interband transitions .",
    "the frequencies of these excitations are compatible with the predictions from band - structure calculations @xcite , taking into account the band energies at the @xmath47-point of the brillouin zone . on the other hand",
    ", those band - structure calculations do not reveal any electronic transition below 1 ev for the undistorted structure ( i.e. , in the normal state ) .",
    "it is thus natural to identify the depletion in the @xmath11 spectrum between the drude and the mid - infrared peak with the onset of the cdw gap .",
    "therefore , the mid - infrared peak is ascribed to the charge excitation across the cdw gap into a single particle ( sp ) state . in the following",
    "we will refer to this feature as the sp peak @xcite . upon increasing the temperature ,",
    "the gap absorption progressively shifts into and is almost screened by the high - frequency tail of the metallic part in @xmath11 ( fig . 3b and 4b ) .",
    "close to and above @xmath1 , the gap feature is indeed at best a broad shoulder overlapped to the drude component .",
    "the temperature dependence of the two most prominent contributions to @xmath11 , the effective metallic component and the cdw gap excitation , will be at the center of our discussion .",
    "to this end and in order to gain more insight into the absorption spectra we apply the standard lorentz - drude ( ld ) approach .",
    "it consists in reproducing the dielectric function by the expression @xcite : @xmath48where @xmath49 is the optical dielectric constant , @xmath50 and @xmath29 are the plasma frequency and the width of the drude peak , whereas @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 are the center - peak frequency , the width , and the mode strength for the @xmath54-th lorentz harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath11 is then obtained from @xmath55 .",
    "the best fit to the data is achieved by a drude term for the metallic contribution and a selection of lorentz harmonic oscillators ( h.o . ) for the finite frequency excitations .",
    "figures 3b and 4b emphasize those fit components for the 10 k spectra . applying such a fit procedure at all temperatures",
    "allows us to systematically reproduce the experimental data in great details , as illustrated for both @xmath33 and @xmath11 at 300 and 10 k in fig . 3 and 4 . similarly",
    "to our previous optical work as a function of pressure @xcite , we can extract from the fits several characteristic energy scales and optical parameters , which can be related to the cdw phase transitions .",
    "the emphasis will be here on the ( drude ) scattering rate , the cdw gap and the fraction of the ungapped fs .    as directly evinced from the data , the metallic component in @xmath11 narrows with decreasing temperature .",
    "this is well represented by the drude scattering rate @xmath29 , shown in the insets of fig .",
    "2b and 2d as a function of temperature for both compounds .",
    "@xmath29 rapidly decreases with decreasing temperature , indicating that deep into the cdw state less scattering channels seem to be available .",
    "this nicely correlates with the overall trend observed in the @xmath30 transport properties ( fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite . the metallic component in @xmath11",
    "is nonetheless characterized by a pronounced high frequency tail which deviates from a purely drude shape ( fig . 3b and 4b ) .",
    "this may suggest a scenario for the conduction band consisting of itinerant ( drude ) charge carriers close to the fermi level and more localized carriers below the mobility edge .",
    "therefore , one can extend the description of the metallic part in @xmath11 , based on the single drude term , to an approach given by the combination of both drude term and first lorentz h.o .",
    "( fig . 3b and 4b ) .",
    "consequently , the alternative way to extract the scattering rate would be to invert the optical conductivity within the generalized drude model , encountering the spectral weight in @xmath11 up to a cut - off frequency of @xmath25 1500 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "one can first obtain the frequency dependence of the scattering rate @xmath56 and consequently its static @xmath57 limit .",
    "it turns out that @xmath58 as well as @xmath29 display the same relative temperature dependence , thus reinforcing our conclusions based on the trend in temperature of the transport properties .     of the ungapped fermi surface plotted versus the single particle excitation @xmath59 ( i.e. , cdw gap ) for both title compounds .",
    "temperature is here an implicit variable .",
    "the inset compares the trend of @xmath60 versus @xmath59 in temperature ( from the main panel ) for erte@xmath0 and hote@xmath0 with the chemical pressure results for selected compounds of the @xmath22te@xmath0 series @xcite .",
    "the polynomial lines through the data in main panel and inset are meant as guide to the eyes.,width=309 ]    since the first lorentz h.o .",
    "merges into the drude tail and should count as part of the effective metallic contribution to @xmath11 , the two lorentz h.o.s , covering the range between 2000 and 5000 @xmath13 ( fig . 3b and 4b ) , then define the average weighted energy scale @xmath59 : @xmath61 which we associate with the cdw gap excitation ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) @xcite . within the same phenomenological approach adopted here for the estimation of @xmath59 , we can also estimate the fraction of the fs , which then remains ungapped across the cdw phase transitions , as follows @xcite : @xmath63 figure 5 displays @xmath60 versus @xmath59 , the temperature being here an implicit variable . upon increasing the temperature",
    ", we observe that the smaller is the cdw gap the larger is the fraction of the ungapped fs .",
    "this is totally in accordance with our previous investigation upon compressing the lattice @xcite , which reveals the simultaneous closing of the cdw gap with the enhancement of @xmath60 .",
    "this is emphasized in the inset of fig . 5 , where the implicit temperature dependence of @xmath60 versus @xmath59 for the title compounds is in trend with the behavior given by the chemical pressure when going from the lighter to the heavier @xmath22te@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "about 30 - 40@xmath36 of fs in erte@xmath0 and hote@xmath0 turns out to be affected at low temperatures by the formation of the cdw condensates .",
    "this is consistent with the tight - binding ( tb ) estimation of the density of states at the fermi level , which seems to be suppressed to @xmath25 77 % of the unmodulated value by the first cdw transition and further to @xmath25 74 % by the second one @xcite .",
    "@xmath60 undergoes minor changes at temperatures below @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "5 ) , supporting the notion evinced from tb that the gains due to the second cdw are modest .",
    "we now turn our attention to the explicit temperature dependence of @xmath59 , which is shown in fig .",
    "@xmath64 for hote@xmath0 and erte@xmath0 is here normalized by its value deep into the cdw ground state ( i.e. , @xmath59(10 k ) ) , while the temperature axis is normalized by the respective @xmath1 .",
    "as expected , @xmath59 monotonically increases with decreasing temperature below @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the optical estimation of the cdw gap for erte@xmath0 at 10 k ( i.e. , @xmath65 3000 @xmath13 , fig .",
    "5 ) is nearly identical with the gap value extracted from arpes experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath59 does not display any clear - cut anomalies in coincidence with the second phase transition at @xmath2 . on the contrary",
    ", the arpes investigation does give evidence for a smaller gap ( i.e. , of the order of 800 @xmath13 ) due to the second cdw @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , arpes also establishes that the area of fs gapped by the first cdw transition is three times the area gapped by the second one @xcite .",
    "therefore , the excitation due to the smaller gap is most probably overcast by the effective metallic contribution in the absorption spectrum and could well merge into the high frequency tail of the drude resonance , as emphasized above .",
    "moreover , with our optical method we only measure the average energy - excitation over the whole brillouin zone , missing the @xmath66-space resolution of arpes .",
    "a signature of the gap feature is already present at 300 k , close to but yet above the first high temperature cdw phase transition at @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "we remark that this is a rather common situation in prototype cdw materials @xcite .",
    "the persistence of the gap above the phase transition temperature can be considered as a fingerprint of precursor effects of the cdw formation and has been widely invoked as a manifestation of the fluctuation regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , cdw fluctuations seem to play an important role in @xmath22te@xmath0 as well , despite their two - dimensionality .",
    "the presence of substantial fluctuations is also confirmed by the observation of superlattice peaks with rapidly increasing width and decreasing correlation length well above @xmath1 @xcite .    ,",
    "normalized by the low temperature values of erte@xmath0 and hote@xmath0 or by the values of late@xmath0 in the @xmath22te@xmath0 series .",
    "the temperature axis is normalized by the respective critical temperatures ( @xmath1 for erte@xmath0 and hote@xmath0 , or @xmath67 for the @xmath22te@xmath0 series , see text ) @xcite .",
    "the vertical thin dotted lines mark the critical temperatures @xmath2 for erte@xmath0 and hote@xmath0 .",
    "the bcs predictions @xcite for the order parameter is shown for comparison.,width=309 ]    it is now instructive to compare the relevant parameter @xmath59 achieved with our optical experiments when varying the temperature ( this work ) and upon lattice compression @xcite . for the purpose of clarity ,",
    "we limit our comparison to the chemical series , having already showed that both chemical and applied pressure are equivalent @xcite .",
    "figure 6 additionally displays the gap ratio for the chemical series ( open squares ) @xcite .",
    "we took the @xmath59 values measured at 300 k , normalized with the gap of late@xmath0 , assumed to be the largest one for @xmath22te@xmath0 . instead of the normalized temperature ,",
    "we consider here the ratio 300 k / t@xmath68 as the effective temperature axis for the chemical series . in fact , it has been shown both with optics and arpes @xcite that upon chemically compressing the lattice , the shape of fs changes to such an extent that the ideal nesting conditions are progressively suppressed .",
    "this leads to a reduction of @xmath67 , which are the measured cdw critical temperatures extracted from the @xmath30 transport data of @xmath22te@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "therefore , reducing the lattice constant along the chemical series at constant room temperature may be considered to be equivalent as changing the relative temperature difference between 300 k ( where the measurement is performed ) and @xmath67 . within the cdw state ,",
    "we evince a general common trend in the development of the gap for the @xmath22te@xmath0 compounds , when changing @xmath22 , as well as for hote@xmath0 and erte@xmath0 , when varying the temperature . as comparison , we reproduce the bcs temperature dependence of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "the resulting overall decrease of the cdw gap equivalently with increasing temperature or lattice compression roughly agrees with the theoretical predictions , based on the mean - field like bcs theory .",
    "deviations might be related to the uncertainties implicit in our fitting procedure towards the estimation of @xmath59 , which can not be excluded a priori , although very unlikely . on the contrary",
    "at least as far as the temperature dependence is concerned , we tend to believe that our comparison with respect to a single bcs order parameter is too crude , since it neglects the cascade - like onset of the two cdw transitions in erte@xmath0 and hote@xmath0 .",
    "indeed in the temperature interval around @xmath2 one encounters the largest deviation from the bcs calculations .",
    "interestingly enough , the recent arpes investigation also pointed out that , while the closing of the gaps is suggestive of a mean - field type behavior , the temperature dependence of the larger cdw gap is somewhat suppressed from the mean - field curve @xcite .",
    "our recent raman scattering study @xcite further emphasized the complex behavior of the collective cdw state within the unidirectional phase as well as at the crossover from the uni- to the bidirectional cdw state .",
    "supported by first principles calculation @xcite we reconcile the unconventional collective signatures of the cdw states with the bilayer structure ( inset fig .",
    "2a ) of the compounds under investigation . nevertheless , a comprehensive theoretical approach , addressing the interplay of both cdw phase transitions , is still missing .",
    "we have studied the temperature dependence of the optical properties of the layered two - dimensional hote@xmath0 and erte@xmath0 compounds , which undergo two cdw phase transitions into a unidirectional and bidirectional state . from the absorption spectrum",
    ", we have extracted the temperature dependence of the order parameter , which gives clear - cut evidence for fluctuation effects .",
    "moreover , we estimated the fraction of fs , which is affected by the formation of the cdw collective states .",
    "our findings generally agree with the bcs predictions and reinforce the notion that increasing temperature is rather equivalent to lattice compression when destroying the cdw state .",
    "similar to conclusions drawn from recent arpes results on the same compounds , our optical data also foresee a dynamical interplay of the two cdws , a theoretical description of which is highly desired .",
