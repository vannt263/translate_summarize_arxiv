    "a long - standing quest in hadronic physics is to relate the properties of free pions , observed in , for instance , pion - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) scattering , to those of the pions which play such a significant role in the nuclear force .",
    "recently , the nijmegen group has provided a striking demonstration that one - pion exchange indeed provides the longest - range component of the two - nucleon potential .",
    "they extracted , with small error bars , the masses of the charged and neutral pions and the couplings of pions to the nucleon from fits to the @xmath6 and @xmath7 scattering data  @xcite . a subsequent nijmegen analysis of @xmath8 data then confirmed that two - pion exchange  @xcite gives a significant fraction of the intermediate - range attraction in the @xmath8 interaction @xcite .",
    "( in some models other mechanisms , e.g. the very broad @xmath9 meson  @xcite , also contribute to this attraction . ) in systems beyond @xmath10 the three - nucleon interaction plays a subtle , but important , role . in this paper",
    "we focus on the fujita - miyazawa ( fm ) @xcite term in the two - pion - exchange three - nucleon interaction ( tpe3ni ) .",
    "it appears  at least for light nuclei  that this is the largest piece of the three - nucleon force  @xcite .",
    "ideally @xmath1 scattering data should be used to directly construct the tpe3ni . however , the pions that generate nuclear forces are highly virtual .",
    "the relation between the scattering they experience from nucleons inside the nucleus and that observed in free space is non - trivial . to determine it , an extrapolation of the @xmath1 amplitude from the `` physical region''where the pion energies are greater than @xmath11to",
    "the `` virtual region''where pion energies are much less than @xmath11is needed .",
    "the delta isobar is the most prominent feature of @xmath1 dynamics .",
    "the delta peak in the @xmath12 elastic scattering cross - section is larger by an order of magnitude than any other  @xcite .",
    "therefore , when constructing models of the @xmath1 interaction that will be used for the extrapolation to the virtual region it is natural to include the delta as an explicit degree of freedom .",
    "this was the path followed many years ago , and the leading two - pion - exchange two- and three - nucleon potentials with an explicit delta were derived by sugawara & von hippel  @xcite and fujita & miyazawa  ( fm )  @xcite , respectively .",
    "these two - pion - exchange @xmath8 and @xmath13 potentials were recently re - derived as pieces of the more general expressions for two- and three - nucleon forces that are obtained when an effective field theory ( eft ) with explicit delta degrees of freedom is applied to the problem of nuclear forces  @xcite . here",
    "we discuss how the fm potential arises in any theory with an explicit delta .",
    "our expression for this potential is connected to @xmath1 scattering data through the delta mass and the @xmath14 coupling constant , both of which can be determined from the @xmath1 data .",
    "but the highly - virtual pions exchanged in the tpe3ni have energies much less than the delta - nucleon mass difference .",
    "this has encouraged the development of an approach to nuclear forces that is different from that of sugawara & von hippel and fujita & miyazawa . in this approach the delta degree of freedom  along with all other",
    "@xmath1 resonances is `` integrated out '' .",
    "this yields an eft in which pions and nucleons interact in the most general way . in this",
    "eft @xmath1 interactions are point - like , and are organized as an expansion in the number of space and time derivatives ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the expansion parameter is essentially @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the pion energy and @xmath17 mev @xmath18 the delta - nucleon mass difference .",
    "applying this ` delta - less ' eft to @xmath19 scattering is challenging ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) since the expansion parameter is , at best , @xmath20 , and the expansion breaks down completely at the delta peak .",
    "however the expansion should converge well if @xmath21 , a condition which should have fair validity in nuclear - structure physics .",
    "the leading contributions to @xmath8 and @xmath13 potentials in this eft were found in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively  .",
    "we have argued that nuclear - structure physics is within the domain of validity of both the theory with explicit deltas and the ` delta - less ' eft .",
    "we might expect then , that the two theories would give similar results for the strength of the tpe3ni .",
    "but this turns out not to be the case .",
    "effective theories without an explicit delta predict a strength for the tpe3ni that is 1.5 to 2.5 times larger than that obtained by fm  @xcite .",
    "studies of the spectrum of light nuclei with the green s function monte carlo method , including three - nucleon interactions , favor a strength of the tpe3ni closer to the fm value  @xcite   and @xmath13 system be the same . ] .",
    "here we identify the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "parameters in the lagrangian of the theory with pions and nucleons alone must be extracted from @xmath1 scattering data .",
    "but the poor convergence of the derivative expansion in that theory tends to contaminate parameters extracted in this way .",
    "these parameters then appear in the tpe3ni and result in overestimation of its strength . within the delta - less eft this problem is only mitigated if many orders in the expansion are retained .",
    "this simple argument is presented as follows . in section  [ sec - lag ]",
    "we write down an eft with nucleons , pions , and explicit deltas , and compute , to leading order , both the @xmath0-wave @xmath19 scattering amplitude and the tpe3ni . in section  [ sec - deltaless ]",
    "we use a theory without explicit deltas to compute the tpe3ni . by construction the @xmath1 amplitudes in this theory and the theory of section  [ sec - lag ] agree at @xmath1 threshold .",
    "we show that they differ by a factor of @xmath22 in their prediction for the strength of the fm @xmath13 potential .",
    "we then discuss how this overestimation would be remedied at higher orders in the delta - less eft , and what the implications of this problem are for contemporary eft computations of the tpe3ni .",
    "although many terms contribute to @xmath1 scattering and the three - nucleon potential , here we focus on the delta contributions .",
    "we do not claim that this is an accurate or complete model for either @xmath1 scattering or the tpe3ni , but it serves to illustrate the point we wish to make regarding the relationship between @xmath1 data and the strength of the tpe3ni in delta - less efts . for discussions of this relationship in the context of hadronic models ,",
    "see , e.g. ref .",
    "we consider @xmath0-wave @xmath1 scattering in an effective theory with an explicit delta degree of freedom",
    ". we will be interested in small pion momenta , and so we need only the leading terms in the @xmath23 and @xmath14 interaction lagrangians .",

    "of course , in the real world there are contributions to the @xmath1 amplitude other than the two graphs we have considered here .",
    "also @xmath62 and @xmath63 will probably be determined from data that are not exactly at threshold .",
    "while we can not say _ a priori _ in which direction these effects go , fitting @xmath1 data at higher energies will presumably only make the extrapolation problem worse .",
    "parts of this problem have been understood for a long time , but , as discussed in the introduction , the prevailing folklore has been that an eft without explicit deltas could still work well in nuclei , because the relevant energies in nuclear - structure physics are much smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "however , the poor convergence of the eft without explicit deltas for @xmath1 scattering affects the tpe3ni because @xmath62 and @xmath63 are not calculated from first principles ; instead they are fitted to threshold @xmath1 data .",
    "this necessitates an extrapolation from pion energies @xmath56 to the energies of the highly - virtual pions in the tpe3ni , which are of order @xmath80 .",
    "this extrapolation takes place over an energy range that is sizable compared to the radius of convergence of the `` delta - less '' theory@xmath74 .",
    "here we have explicitly considered the implications of such an extrapolation for the three - nucleon potential , but other few - nucleon potentials ( including the two - nucleon force ) will be afflicted by the same problem .",
    "all use @xmath1 parameters that are potentially contaminated in a similar way .",
    "such contamination will occur in all efts for low - energy hadronic physics which contain only pion and nucleon degrees of freedom .      in a theory with explicit deltas",
    "this extrapolation is under much better control , since the pion - energy dependence of the @xmath1 amplitude is better reproduced .",
    "in contrast , at leading order in the `` delta - less '' theory the coefficients of the two operators in @xmath81 are energy independent , and so the value extracted for them at threshold , where @xmath82 , is used in the tpe3ni , where @xmath83 .",
    "but at higher orders in this eft additional corrections to the @xmath1 amplitude , and in particular to the two operators in @xmath84 , enter . to see what form this higher - order energy dependence would take , we expand the result ( [ apin ] ) in powers of @xmath85 .",
    "the first correction to the leading - order results for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( [ b ] ) occurs at @xmath86 $ ] .",
    "the form of @xmath87 is now : @xmath88 in the eft , terms such as @xmath89 and @xmath90 appear in the lagrangian as pion - nucleon interactions with time derivatives .",
    "we must fit @xmath1 data over a range of pion energies to determine both @xmath62 and @xmath91 .",
    "if , once again , we imagine living in a world where the true answer was given by eq .",
    "( [ apin ] ) , then fitting the form ( [ eq : btilde ] ) to reproduce ( [ apin ] ) in the region around @xmath82 yields : @xmath92 note that at @xmath1 threshold this gives exactly the same result for @xmath93 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : o ] ) .",
    "however , extrapolating to @xmath94 now yields a tpe3ni that has an additional factor of @xmath95 in its strength .",
    "if we set @xmath96 , this gives an overall factor of @xmath97 , instead of the @xmath98 found in the `` exact '' calculation with explicit deltas .",
    "this means that in the theory _ without _ explicit deltas the `` exact '' factor @xmath99 is being built up as : @xmath100 a series that converges moderately quickly .    to summarize : in the theory without explicit deltas it is important to realize that the factor @xmath101 obtained by fitting @xmath1 `` data '' with the leading - order form ( [ eq : o ] ) is not the final answer .",
    "this result will change when higher - order terms are incorporated in the theory and used to improve the extrapolation from @xmath102 to @xmath83 .",
    "we can estimate the size of such terms based on our knowledge that the convergence will be governed by the parameter @xmath103 , and that  due to crossing  only even terms in this expansion can appear in @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the leading - order result should therefore be quoted as : @xmath104.\\ ] ] more conservative error bars are certainly acceptable , but the @xmath105% we have chosen is the minimum permissible theoretical error that can be assigned to @xmath62 when it is extracted in the theory without explicit deltas .",
    "such an error bar turns out to be consistent with the `` exact '' answer for @xmath62 in the simple model considered here .",
    "we have shown that theories without an explicit delta tend to overestimate the delta contribution to the tpe3ni .",
    "this is because there is an error in the leading - order computation of the three - nucleon potential in the `` delta - less '' theory .",
    "the error is @xmath106 25% , and it is necessary to include terms suppressed by @xmath85 in the eft to reduce it .",
    "the inclusion of other higher - order effects , such as nucleon recoil and dispersive effects for intermediate - state deltas , may make the extrapolation error smaller than we found , but it seems unlikely that it will completely remove the difficulty .",
    "unfortunately this problem is present in the state - of - the - art n@xmath107lo chiral eft computation of @xmath8 and @xmath13 potentials  @xcite .",
    "the terms that ameliorate the overestimation appear in @xmath108 , and so will not enter the chiral eft nuclear force until n@xmath109lo . computing the two- and three - nucleon potentials to this ( or higher ) order will take considerable effort",
    ". it may well be that an eft with explicit deltas is simply a more efficient tool than one without .",
    "in fact , the first studies in nuclear eft @xcite included diagrams with intermediate deltas in their calculation of the nuclear force .",
    "the drawback of such a treatment is that in order to fix parameters one must analyze data around the delta resonance , which necessitates a resummation of the delta self - energy .",
    "only recently has a power counting been devised that allows a systematic eft treatment of effects in this kinematic region  @xcite .",
    "the delta - less eft has also found difficulties with certain @xmath1 parameters that are large because the effects of the integrated - out delta are encoded there . in ref .",
    "@xcite epelbaum _",
    "_ argued that there is a cancellation of delta - excitation and @xmath110-exchange contributions in nuclear forces .",
    "this motivated their use of @xmath8 and @xmath13 potentials containing @xmath1-interaction parameters smaller than those extracted from chiral analyses of @xmath19 scattering data .",
    "we stress that the reduction in strength of the @xmath13 force we have discussed here is not based on such an argument .",
    "it is independent of details of nuclear dynamics at the distance scale @xmath111 .",
    "so , until the theory with explicit delta degrees of freedom is further developed , or delta - less theories can be extended to higher order , the @xmath1 parameters used in the @xmath13 potential should be viewed as only loosely constrained by @xmath1 data .",
    "furthermore , eft extractions of @xmath1 parameters from @xmath8 data ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and from @xmath1 data ( see , e.g. ref .",
