    "it is now widely accepted that at least two kinds of neutrinos are massive@xcite .",
    "the pressing questions we are facing now : ( 1 ) how many extra degrees of freedom beyond the standard model ( sm ) are responsible for generating the neutrino masses , and ( 2 ) are they fermionic or bosonic ? on the phenomenological side , it is practical to ask whether we are able to test the neutrino mass generation mechanism directly . if the new degrees of freedom decouple at a rather high energy scale , unfortunately this happens for some of the cases , we are left with only one effective dim-5 operator @xmath2 at low energy .",
    "for example , there is no way to directly test the usual seesaw mechanism@xcite with @xmath3 gev or higher majorana neutrinos .",
    "and we can only study its indirect consequences , for example , the leptogenesis .",
    "it will be interesting , although unnecessary , to have a neutrino mass generation mechanism and at the same time the responsible new degrees of freedom are accessible within human s reach .",
    "it was first pointed out by zee and babu@xcite that the active neutrino masses could be generated radiatively . in that case ,",
    "due to the loop suppression factors , the active neutrino masses are naturally small compared to other sm charged fermions .",
    "although the masses of the new degrees of freedom are totally arbitrary , they are more likely to be probed experimentally in some parameter space .",
    "therefore , we aim for a model in which the neutrino masses are radiatively generated .",
    "moreover , we hope to have a unified mechanism such that the mass scale of the new degrees of freedom is not totally arbitrary .",
    "on the other hand , there are several ways to infer the dark matter abundance @xmath4 in the universe@xcite .",
    "the existence of dark matter with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km/(s.mpc ) , requires physics beyond the sm",
    ". it will be even more interesting if one of the new fields for radiatively generating neutrino mass serves as the dark matter candidate .",
    "in fact , several interesting models have been proposed to connect the origin of neutrino masses to the existence of the cold dark matter@xcite . and , a viable dark matter candidate must be as long - lived as the universe .",
    "it is common for people to impose global discrete or continuous symmetry to stabilize the dark matter candidate from decaying ( @xcite is an exception , but it failed to come up with a theory which is renormalizable and free of anomalies . ) however , the origin of these global discrete or continuous symmetries is not explained .",
    "moreover , quantum gravity effects do not respect global symmetries  @xcite .",
    "one elegant remedy is to use the discrete symmetry originated from a spontaneously broken gauged symmetry , known as the krauss - wilczek mechanism(kwm)@xcite .",
    "for a recent implementation of kwm to stabilize the dark matter candidate see @xcite and references therein .    in this paper , a @xmath7 gauge symmetry",
    "is introduced on top of the sm interactions and it is responsible for all three features mentioned above : neutrino masses generation , testable new degrees of freedom , and the existence of stable dark matter . the @xmath7 is spontaneously broken by a sm singlet scalar which carries two units of @xmath7 charge .",
    "a gauged discrete @xmath8 symmetry can remain after the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of @xmath7 and the @xmath9-odd cold dark matter candidate can be stable . while each ingredient is not new , to our best knowledge ,",
    "ours is the first successful model which conjoins all .",
    "we present a minimal model which makes use of the kwm and radiatively generates the neutrino masses at the lowest possible mass dimension .",
    "in addition to the sm fermions and higgs doublet @xmath10 , this model consists of two extra pairs of chiral fermions @xmath11 and @xmath12 , one extra higgs doublet @xmath13 , and two complex scalars @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "their quantum numbers are summarized in table [ tab_charge ] .",
    "the @xmath7 charge assignment forbids the @xmath16 and @xmath17 to have majorana masses .",
    "note that we need at least two pairs of @xmath18 and @xmath19 to accommodate the observed neutrino data . introducing vector - like fermions",
    "is needed for cancelling the anomalies .",

    "the presence of the first two terms explicitly violates the @xmath26 symmetry and thus suggests a natural scale for @xmath29 , although it is perfectly legitimate for @xmath30 to take any other value . in this work ,",
    "we simply focus on the scenario that @xmath31 is around tev from the standpoint of being phenomenologically interesting .",

    "<S> a simple renormalizable @xmath0 gauge model is constructed to explain the smallness of the active neutrino masses and provide the stable cold dark matter candidate simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> the local @xmath0 symmetry is assumed to be spontaneously broken by a scalar field around the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> the active neutrino masses are then generated at one - loop level . </S>",
    "<S> this model contains several cold dark matter candidates whose stability is guaranteed by a residual discrete gauge @xmath1 symmetry a la the krauss - wilczek mechanism . unlike the other dark matter models , no further global discrete or continuous symmetry is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the masses of all fermionic degrees of freedom beyond the standard model are closely related to the scale of spontaneous breaking of @xmath0 thus they could be probed at or below the tev scale . the possible cosmological and phenomenological consequences are briefly discussed . </S>"
