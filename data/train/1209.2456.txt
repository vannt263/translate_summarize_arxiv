    "neutrinos undergo the phenomenon of flavor oscillations ; a neutrino created in a particular flavor ( electron , mu , or tau ) will change its flavor , a phenomenon not accounted for in the standard model of the electroweak interaction .",
    "a possible explanation of this behavior is neutrino oscillations .",
    "the neutrinos are assigned masses .",
    "the created neutrino has definite flavor , but these flavor eigenstates are not the physical free particles , the mass states .",
    "this leads to a phenomenology that is parameterized by three mixing angles , a cp violating phase , and two mass - squared differences , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11to appear in horizons of innovative theories , experiments , and supercomputing in nuclear physics ( new orleans , june 4 - 6 , 2012 ) experiments have found that neutrino oscillations approximately break into two @xmath12 oscillations , termed solar and atmospheric oscillations .",
    "the solar oscillations are predominantly governed by the solar data and the kamland experiment , and they predominantly determine @xmath13 and @xmath14 , while the atmospheric oscillation parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 are predominantly determined by the atmospheric data and the long - baseline muon disappearance data .",
    "the last mixing angle @xmath0 and the cp - violating phase @xmath17 mix the two @xmath12 oscillations .",
    "an outstanding question in neutrino phenomenology is that of the hierarchy , whether the small mass - squared difference lies below ( normal hierarchy ) or above ( inverse hierarchy ) the large mass - squared difference . a related question , as we will show , is whether the value of @xmath0 is positive or negative .",
    "we utilize the convention @xcite that @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this is the more convenient parameterization for discussing the symmetries of interest here .",
    "recent long - baseline reactor experiments @xcite have accurately measured the value of @xmath0 and found it to be large , @xmath20 . before these measurements",
    ", the world s data demonstrated very little preference for either the hierarchy or the sign of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to examine the effect that the recent knowledge of @xmath0 has on the hierarchy question and on the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "this report is preliminary in that we will fix the mixing parameters except @xmath0 at values from a recent analysis .",
    "since there is no strong evidence for cp - violation , we set the cp phase @xmath17 to zero .     in vacuum versus neutrino energy for the t2k experiment .",

    "the task of extracting neutrino mixing parameters from data is complicated by the existence of symmetries that lead to degeneracies @xcite , where degeneracies mean different mixing parameters yield the same oscillation probability .",
    "the minos @xcite , t2k @xcite , and the future no@xmath5a @xcite experiments are at an @xmath3 where such a symmetry nearly exists . in the limit of @xmath21 and",
    "no matter effects , these experiments would be insensitive to the hierarchy .",
    "the symmetry pertinent to these experiments , using our bounds on the mixing angles , is the combined interchange of hierarchy and a change of the sign of @xmath0 , a four - fold degeneracy . in fig .",

    "thus non - zero @xmath0 breaks the four fold degeneracy down to two two - fold degeneracies .",
    "hierarchy and linear in @xmath0 effects require interference between the two mass - squared difference terms , and this is the smallest value of @xmath3 where such effects appear .",
    "these effects are greatest at the peak of the first oscillation generated by the small solar mass - squared differences . for vacuum oscillations",
    "this occurs @xcite when @xmath30 km / gev . including matter effects yields @xmath31 km and @xmath32 gev as typical ideal values . extrapolating from the results in ref .",
    "@xcite to the now known value of @xmath0 gives a large @xmath22 with a 20% difference between @xmath22 for @xmath2 and @xmath33 for such an experiment .",

    "@xcite/ no@xmath5a @xcite .",
    "the effect of including the matter interaction of the neutrino is to alter the magnitude of the oscillations while leaving the position of the peaks nearly unchanged .",
    "thus spectral information that measures the position of the peaks maintains approximately the two - fold degeneracy of the vacuum oscillations .",
    "the magnitude of the signal then breaks this symmetry to distinguish the hierarchy while it alone does not distinguish well the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "there is a complementarity between the t2k and no@xmath5a experiments .",
    "t2k is situated to determine the peak of the oscillation probability , ideal for breaking the four - fold degeneracy .",
    "no@xmath5a has the longer baseline and the larger matter effects thus increasing the difference in the magnitude of the oscillations , giving it the greater sensitivity to the hierarchy .",

    "[ fig5 ] where we show @xmath36 for the four cases of hierarchy and sign of @xmath0 .",
    "the location of the minima are found to be only slightly affected by the choice of hierarchy or sign of @xmath0 . for the now known value of @xmath37 , atmospheric data distinguish between hierarchy and the sign of @xmath0 at a not negligible level .",
    "the normal hierarchy , positive @xmath0 case is disfavored , while the inverse hierarchy , negative @xmath0 case is favored with the other two cases lying in the middle .",
    "this is made quantitative in table  [ tab3 ] . by marginalizing over @xmath38",
    "we calculated the relative probability of each of the four cases .",
    "the probability that normal hierarchy , positive @xmath0 is correct is 0.2% , a fairly strong indication that it is not correct . the inverse hierarchy , negative @xmath0 case is 90.5% probable that it is correct , a not negligible preference , while the normal hierarchy , negative @xmath0 and the inverse hierarchy , positive @xmath0 cases are 2.2% and 7.1% probable , respectively .",
    "we compare our best fit value @xmath39 for negative hierarchy , negative @xmath0 to @xmath40 found for normal hierarchy , positive @xmath0 or negative hierarchy , negative @xmath0 from ref .",
    "@xcite and to @xmath41 found for positive or negative hierarchy and negative @xmath0 for ref .",
    "there is disagreement on the sign of @xmath0 and the hierarchy question .",
    "we find a larger hierarchy difference than do the other two .",
    "since the present t2k and minos experiments have little preference for the hierarchy and the sign of @xmath0 , the differences between the analyses arise from the atmospheric analysis .",
    "these differences may be resolved by future super - k atmospheric data .",
    "although the super - k data is statistically significant on the whole , the role of @xmath0 in the analysis is a small effect . for example",
    ", the bins that indicate the presence or absence of the msw resonance , are statistically not too significant .",
    "further , t2k and no@xmath5a have not produced data of statistical significance . with the large value for @xmath0 their future data",
