    "physically - inspired approaches play a prominent role in both analyzing and devising solution strategies to complex optimization problems . for example , a large number of combinatorial optimization problems can be encoded into the couplings of ising hamiltonians , such that the minimum - energy configuration of the latter corresponds to the optimal solution of the former  @xcite . in principle , at low enough temperatures these auxiliary physical systems should eventually relax to their ground state , which subsequently can be measured and decoded to provide a solution to the original optimization problem . in reality , however , the relaxation time can be extremely long . in the language of disordered ising models",
    ", the hardness of the encoded optimization problems can be attributed to the rough shape of the energy landscapes of the corresponding hamiltonians in the configuration space , which typically consist of many hills and valleys  @xcite .",
    "the presence of these local extrema renders the task of finding the global minimum of the system ( i.e. the true ground state ) very difficult .    to overcome this issue ,",
    "quantum annealing was first introduced as a computational simulation method , similar to simulated annealing  @xcite , but with quantum fluctuations taking the place of thermal fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the idea of quantum annealing is then to use quantum fluctuations to allow the system to tunnel through  spiky \" barriers , for which simulated annealing is inefficient , thereby improving the system s chance to explore the configuration space more efficiently .",
    "similar to simulated annealing , in this case the strength of the fluctuations is gradually reduced to zero , allowing the system to relax into the ground state of the problem hamiltonian .    a quantum annealing device is a machine that physically implements this approach by realizing a time - dependent hamiltonian , which attempts to follow the adiabatic quantum algorithm  @xcite .",
    "this machine is initialized in the ground state of a beginning hamiltonian , and then evolves in time while following the adiabatic path as closely as possible , to finally relax into the ground state of the problem hamiltonian .",
    "this ground state configuration can subsequently be measured to provide a solution to the encoded optimization problem .",
    "following the recent technological advances in manufacturing systems of coupled qubits , the idea of building a special - purpose quantum annealing device to solve optimization problems has attracted much attention and prototypes of such devices have already been implemented  @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the performance of a quantum annealer compared to quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations have shown that for tunneling between local minima in the energy landscape , quantum annealing and qmc exhibit the same scaling of computational time with system size  @xcite .",
    "this observation has led to the conjecture that if qmc is inefficient in simulating a problem , then a quantum annealer is also inefficient in solving that problem as long as its hamiltonian along the annealing path belongs to the class of the so - called stoquastic hamiltonians  @xcite , for which efficient ( sign - problem - free  @xcite ) qmc simulations can be performed .",
    "this conjecture implies that for a physical quantum annealing device to have any chance of scaling better than classical algorithms ( such as qmc ) , it must take advantage of non - stoquastic hamiltonians , for which efficient qmc can not be performed .",
    "the formal definition of stoquastic hamiltonians states that their path - integral configurations ( in some local computational basis ) contributing to the partition function , all have real and non - negative weights . a sufficient condition for this is that their matrix representations in the computational basis have real and nonpositive off - diagonal elements  @xcite .",
    "these hamiltonians include bosonic problems , non - frustrated quantum magnets and certain fermionic systems  @xcite . in general , qmc algorithms can efficiently update path - integral configurations , proposing new configurations with an effort that only grows polynomially with the problem size @xcite .",
    "path - integral qmc methods map the @xmath0-dimensional quantum system to a @xmath1-dimensional classical one , hence the quantum partition function can be mapped to the partition function of @xmath2 copies of a classical system , which occupy an extra dimension , z = e^-h ( e^-h / p)^p with @xmath3 being proportional to the inverse temperature .",
    "this additional dimension can be interpreted as imaginary time with each time slice defined as , = /p .",
    "the partition function is then reduced to @xmath2 sums over complete sets of basis states , @xmath4 , which are weighted by the size of the time slice and the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath5 , z _",
    "j = 1^p _ l_j",
    "l_j |e^-h_j , j+1| l_j+1 .",
    "[ qmc ] when the off - diagonal matrix elements , @xmath6 , are zero or negative , these weights are purely positive for each time slice , which in turn enables stochastic sampling of these configurations in a qmc simulation . these hamiltonians are dubbed ` stoquastic '  @xcite , which combines the words ` quantum ' and ` stochastic ' , the latter referring to the stochastic nature of the monte carlo algorithms . here , for all practical purposes the term stoquastic simply means avoiding the sign problem  @xcite .    for hamiltonians",
    "whose matrix representations in the computational basis have positive or complex off - diagonal elements , the corresponding weights in eq .",
    "( [ qmc ] ) will be non - positive .",
    "these hamiltonians are generally more complex than stoquastic ones  @xcite , and they constitute an essential ingredient for universal adiabatic quantum computing  @xcite .    here",
    "we examine the potential power of this complexity in a different context and ask whether quantum annealers with non - stoquastic hamiltonians can show superior performance in solving optimization problems . along these lines ref .",
    "@xcite provides encouraging evidence that for certain problems non - stoquastic hamiltonians can provide a scaling advantage over the traditionally - studied transverse - field annealing hamiltonians .    to realize a concrete analysis",
    ", we pick a particular ising spin glass model as our problem hamiltonian , choose a specific annealing schedule , fix a total annealing time and measure the performance of our non - stoquastic hamiltonian by calculating success probabilities in a range of system sizes . in what follows , we first set the stage in section  [ sec : notation ] by briefly explaining the notation and the methods used .",
    "we then present the numerical results in section  [ sec : results ] , and conclude by presenting a discussion of our observations in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the general problem hamiltonian encoded in an ising model has the form , h_p = _ i < j = 1^n j_ij ^z_i ^z_j + _ i = 1^n h_i ^z_i , where the choices of pairwise couplings , @xmath7 , and the individually applied fields , @xmath8 , determine the specific optimization problem of interest .",
    "here we focus on a disordered , spin glass problem that resembles the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model is infinite - dimensional in the thermodynamic limit and it has been shown that its worst cases are nondeterministic polynomially ( np ) hard  @xcite .",
    "the problem is defined on a fully - connected graph , i.e. every pair of spins is coupled , and the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath7 are randomly chosen from a continuous gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance  @xcite .",
    "the original time - dependent hamiltonian for the adiabatic quantum algorithm has the form  @xcite , h^0 ( ) & = & ( 1- ) h_b + h_p , [ eq : hx ] where @xmath9 $ ] is the dimensionless annealing parameter and @xmath10 is the total annealing time .",
    "the beginning hamiltonian ( at @xmath11 ) , whose ground state is unique and easy to implement , is traditionally chosen to be the uniform transverse field hamiltonian , h_b = _ i = 1^n ^x_i . in the quantum annealing language @xmath12 , which is also known as the driver hamiltonian , effectively flips a spin in the computational basis .",
    "it is therefore a source for quantum fluctuations , which allow the system to explore the energy landscape of the problem hamiltonian during the annealing process . as @xmath13 increases",
    ", the strength of the driver term decreases while the strength of the problem hamiltonian increases .",
    "if this process is done slowly enough so that the adiabatic theorem can be satisfied then at @xmath14 the ground state of the system should evolve into the ground state of @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath16 is stoquastic but by modifying the driver term a non - stoquastic hamiltonian can be obtained . in this work we use driver",
    "hamiltonians that include terms of the form @xmath17 with both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic couplings  @xcite . to avoid the massive degeneracy resulting from the frustrated state of antiferromagnetically",
    "coupled spins on a fully - connected graph , following  @xcite , we choose our total annealing hamiltonian to be of the form ,    h ( ) = ( 1- ) h_b + ( 1- ) h_i + h_p , [ eq : genform ] where we begin with the unique ground state of @xmath12 and enter the additional coupled driver terms , @xmath17 , via the intermediate hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 controls the strength of the intermediate term and here is set to be @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "note that in the computational basis , the local effect of each @xmath17 term is to flip the @xmath21 and @xmath22 spins simultaneously . to distinguish the effect of flipping a pair of spins ( as opposed to a single spin flip due to @xmath12 ) from the possible specific effects of non - stoquasticity we also consider an intermediate hamiltonian with uniform ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "thus , we end up with the following three intermediate hamiltonians : h_i^f & = & - _ i < j = 1^n ^x_i^x_j[eq : hixx ] + h_i^a & = & + _ i < j = 1^n ^x_i^x_j,[eq : hixxp ] + h_i^m &",
    "= & _ i < j = 1^n r_ij ^x_i^x_j[eq : hixxs ] . in the latter case @xmath23",
    "is randomly chosen , giving rise to an intermediate hamiltonian with both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings  @xcite . here",
    "the superscripts @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to _ ferromagnetic _ , _ antiferromagnetic _ and _ mixed _ , respectively .    inserting either @xmath27 or @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genform ] ) results in non - stoquastic total hamiltonians ( for @xmath29 ) , while inserting @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : genform ] ) produces a stoquastic hamiltonian with coupled spin flip driver terms .",
    "in what follows we will refer to the intermediate hamiltonians as drivers with coupled fluctuations , or simply as coupled drivers .",
    "we compare the success rate of hamiltonians with coupled drivers against the original hamiltonian with an uncoupled driver term , @xmath16 ( eq .  ( [ eq : hx ] ) ) , as our reference . to make referencing easier we label the hamiltonians with coupled drivers as , h^ ( ) & = & h^0 ( ) + ( 1- ) h_i^ , [ eq : hxx ] where @xmath31 = @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , correspond to stoquastic , non - stoquastic with uniform antiferromagnetic driver terms and non - stoquastic with mixed driver terms , respectively .",
    "for the rest of this paper we use the same index @xmath31 for labeling various quantities such as success probabilities , @xmath32 , and minimum gaps , @xmath33 , which result from hamiltonians @xmath34 .",
    "our main numerical tools are exact diagonalization , to calculate the instantaneous energy spectra of the hamiltonians @xmath16 and @xmath34 , and the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , to simulate the process of quantum annealing , |()= h ( ) | ( ) , where we have set @xmath35 .    as our main metric of performance",
    "we choose the success probability  @xcite , defined as the square of the overlap between @xmath36 , the true ground state of @xmath37 , obtained from exact diagonalization and @xmath38 , the approximate ground state of @xmath37 , resulting from numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation associated with hamiltonian @xmath34 , i.e. , p^(t ) = |_g| ^_g(= 1)|^2 , for @xmath39 . in the case of degenerate final ground states ,",
    "we redefine the success probability as the sum over individual success probabilities with equal weights .",
    "we study systems of @xmath40 spins where @xmath41 and choose a fixed annealing time of @xmath42 for all system sizes . for each system size",
    "we generate 10000 instances and for each instance calculate the success probabilities and the instantaneous energy spectra as functions of time according to our four annealing schedules , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hx ] , [ eq : hxx ] ) .    to better compare the performance of different hamiltonians ,",
    "we define two additional quantities .",
    "the first is the _ success probability enhancement ratio _ ,",
    "defined for each type of hamiltonian with coupled drivers @xmath34 as the percentage of instances for which @xmath34 provides the best improvement over @xmath16 , i.e. it performs better than @xmath16 as well as the other two hamiltonians with coupled drivers .",
    "if we denote the number of such instances with @xmath43 and the total number of instances with @xmath44 then the enhancement ratio is simply defined as , r_en^ = .",
    "[ eq : ren ] for each of the instances identified in @xmath45 , we then define the _ success probability enhancement _ , which simply quantifies the actual enhancement that results from applying @xmath34 , i.e. p_en^ = , [ eq : pen ] note that we always have @xmath46 .",
    "we start our analysis by determining the success probability enhancement ratios , @xmath45 , and the corresponding enhancements , @xmath47 , for each hamiltonian with coupled drivers , @xmath34 . for a system of @xmath48",
    "spins we find that for the stoquastic hamiltonian the enhancement ratio is significant with @xmath49 while for the non - stoquastic hamiltonians the corresponding ratios are much smaller with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pen ] show the distributions of the corresponding enhancements @xmath47 .",
    "we see that for the stoquastic hamiltonian the distribution is very uneven with a sharp peak near the unity and a very modest @xmath52 percentile value of order @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , for the non - stoquastic hamiltonian @xmath54 we see that the distribution is substantially more spread - out with the @xmath52 percentile value of the enhancement being of the order @xmath55 .",
    "the enhancement distribution for the other non - stoquastic hamiltonian @xmath56 is also peaked near unity but it also a long tail with the @xmath52 percentile value of order @xmath57 .    to determine the behavior of @xmath45 as functions of system size we studied systems with @xmath41 spins .",
    "the results , shown in the second row of fig .  [ fig : pen ] , indicate that for the stoquastic hamiltonian , @xmath58 remains large and it even grows with the system size from @xmath59 for @xmath60 to @xmath61 for @xmath48 . for the non - stoquastic hamiltonian with uniform antiferromagnetic couplings we see that @xmath62 initially decreases and then saturates around @xmath63 while for the other non - stoquastic hamiltonian with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath64 fluctuates around a mean value of @xmath65 .",
    "we attribute the large fluctuations in @xmath64 to the random nature of sign assignments in the coupled driver term , @xmath66 , and the fact that for each system size a different ratio of plus to minus signs is assigned  @xcite . as will be shown in the following sections , these fluctuations remain persistent in the case of other quantities that result from @xmath56 as well .",
    "we next study the change in the distribution of success probability enhancement as a function of system size by plotting the @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath52 percentile values of @xmath47 as functions of @xmath40 .",
    "these plots ( shown in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pen ] ) indicate that the distributions of success probability enhancement remain fairly constant as the system size grows . for the stoquastic hamiltonian , @xmath69",
    ", we see that the distribution remains peaked near minimal enhancement , as indicated by the @xmath67 and @xmath68 percentile values lying close to each other near unity for all system sizes and a modest @xmath52 percentile with average value of @xmath70 . for",
    "the non - stoquastic hamiltonians , @xmath54 and @xmath56 we see that the distributions remain spread - out across different system sizes , with the @xmath52 percentile values of the enhancements persistently fluctuating around much larger average values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    as in the case of @xmath48 , for all system sizes we see a clear difference between the improvement due to non - stoquastic hamiltonians and the stoquastic one : the stoquastic hamiltonian improves a large fraction of instances and this fraction grows with the system size , but the actual enhancement due to this hamiltonian is modest .",
    "in contrast , the non - stoquastic hamiltonians affect much smaller fractions of instances , which remain fairly constant as the system size grows , but the actual enhancements can be very large .",
    "this trade - off between the enhancement ratio and the corresponding enhancement in success probability occurs in other hamiltonians that we have studied as well  @xcite .",
    "we next take a closer look at the specific instances that show the best success probability under each type of hamiltonian with coupled drivers @xmath34and call them _ affected instances_. note that , given this definition , there are exactly three non - overlapping  @xcite sets of affected instances , one for each @xmath39 .",
    "the goal here is to determine the common properties of each set of affected instances and to classify them based on how hard they are for @xmath16 and the best possible improvement that can be obtained from @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we are interested in the _ initial _ probabilities of the affected instances , resulting from @xmath16 , and the _ final _ probabilities of the same instances resulting from @xmath34 . to make referencing easier ,",
    "for each set of affected instances , we denote the initial probabilities with @xmath73 , where the additional subscript refers to the hamiltonian with coupled drivers for which the affected instances show the best success probability . as",
    "before we denote the final probabilities of the affected instances with @xmath32 .",
    "the panels in the top row of fig .",
    "[ fig : pai ] show scatter plots of the initial and final probabilities of the affected instances , for a system of @xmath48 spins . here",
    "the vertical axes correspond to the final probabilities @xmath32 of the affected instances resulting from @xmath34 and the horizontal axes represent the initial probabilities @xmath73 of those same instances resulting from @xmath16 .",
    "we see that the stoquastic hamiltonian @xmath69 affects a large range of instances , but mainly those with higher initial probabilities as is evident by the concentration of the instances near @xmath74 .    for the non - stoquastic hamiltonian @xmath54",
    "we see that the range of initial probabilities is very small and is limited to very hard problems . as a result of applying @xmath54",
    "the lower bound improves substantially while the upper bound shows little improvement .",
    "finally for @xmath56 we see that problems with a large range of initial probabilities can be improved , including both easy and hard problems and the resulting probabilities also cover a large range .    to determine the dependence of the initial and final probabilities to the change in system size we plot the median values of @xmath73 and @xmath32 for various system sizes .",
    "these plots , depicted in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : pai ] , show that the probabilities generally decrease as the system size grows and the improvement in success probability remains most pronounced in the case of the non - stoquastic hamiltonian with uniform couplings @xmath54 followed by @xmath56 while the improvement resulting from the stoquastic hamiltonian @xmath69 remains marginal since the initial probabilities are on average quite high .",
    "so far we have seen that the stoquastic hamiltonian tends to provide small improvements on easier problems , whereas non - stoquastic hamiltonians mainly provide larger improvements on harder problems . to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the performance of each type of hamiltonian",
    ", we study the instantaneous energy spectrum of the system , which we calculate using exact diagonalization . in the following two sections we study the distribution of the minimum gaps and the number of anti - crossings in the spectra of the affected instances and",
    "discuss their significance .",
    "we proceed by taking a closer look at each hamiltonian s affected instances and study the distribution of the corresponding minimum gaps . here , for each set of affected instances , we are interested in the distributions of initial minimum gaps , resulting from @xmath16 and the final minimum gaps , resulting from @xmath34 .",
    "we use a similar notation to the case of success probabilities and for each set of affected instances denote the initial minimum gaps with @xmath75 and the final values with @xmath33 .",
    "scatter plots of theses values for a system of @xmath48 spins are shown in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapai ] .",
    "similar to the plots of probabilities , here too the vertical axes correspond to the final minimum gaps and the horizontal axes represent the initial minimum gaps of the affected instances .",
    "for the stoquastic hamiltonian we see that the affected instances come with a large range of initial gaps and turning on @xmath69 increases the gap for over @xmath76 of the affected instances . for the non - stoquastic hamiltonian @xmath54",
    "we see that the range of the initial gaps is smaller than the stoquastic case and turning on the coupled driver terms mainly improves the lower bound .",
    "we see that the final gaps @xmath77 can increase but also for about @xmath78 of instances @xmath79 .",
    "the effect of @xmath56 on its respective minimum gaps seems to be similar to both @xmath69 and @xmath54 .",
    "similar to @xmath69 here too the initial range is large and the application of @xmath56 results in a modest improvement of this range . but also similar to @xmath54 for a significant @xmath80 of instances the gap decreases or remains unchanged .",
    "plots of the median values of the gaps as functions of system size , depicted in the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : mingapai ] , show that the trends observed in the case of @xmath48 remain persistent as the system size grows , namely , the application of the stoquastic hamiltonian for the majority of the affected instances clearly increases the minimum gaps , while for the non - stoquastic hamiltonians a correlation between the change in the size of minimum gaps and improvement of success probability in affected instances is less clear .",
    "the increase in the size of minimum gap in the case of the stoquastic hamiltonian can be explained using a mean - field model , where the intermediate term @xmath30 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : hixx ] ) ) effectively increases the strength of the transverse field and thus also the gap .",
    "the increase in the size of the gap provides a straightforward explanation for the improvement in the final success probability by reducing the probability of transitioning away from the ground state during the annealing process  @xcite .",
    "this seems to be the dominant mechanism by which our stoquastic hamiltonian @xmath69 improves the success probability of the majority of its affected instances .",
    "note that in general for those instances for which the initial gaps resulting from @xmath16 are extremely small , therefore they are far away from the mean of the distribution , the application of any perturbation to the annealing hamiltonian has a higher chance of increasing the gaps , thereby pushing them toward the mean of the minimum gap distribution .",
    "thus , for these instances almost any perturbation , stoquastic or non - stoquastic , has a chance of improving the gaps .    the case for non - stoquastic hamiltonians , however , is generally more enigmatic since for a significant number of the affected instances the gap does not increase , hence no clear correlation between the change in the size of the gap and the enhancement of success probability can be observed . in the next section",
    "we study the spectrum more closely , which shines some light on this puzzle .",
    "the final quantity that we consider is the number of anti - crossings between the ground state and the first excited state energies during the evolution of the system .",
    "we study this quantity for the affected instances for each hamiltonian with coupled drivers and use the notation @xmath81 and @xmath82 for the the initial and final numbers of anti - crossings resulting from @xmath16 and @xmath34 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : nlcai ] show scatter plots of these quantities for a system of @xmath48 spins .    for the example shown we see that the stoquastic hamiltonian mainly reduces the number of anti - crossings while the non - stoquastic hamiltonians mainly increase them .",
    "this is particularly evident in the case of @xmath54 .",
    "plots of the average numbers of anti - crossings as functions of system size , shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : nlcai ] , further confirm the observations in the specific case of @xmath48 for all systems sizes i.e. for stoquastic hamiltonians the average number of anti - crossings slightly decreases while for non - stoquastic hamiltonians this quantity clearly increases .",
    "the increase in the number of anti - crossings in the case of non - stoquastic hamiltonians can be explained by noting that the presence of long - range anti - ferromagnetic couplings in this case increases the level of frustration in the system , thus modifying the instantaneous energy spectrum with the addition of further anti - crossings with small gaps .",
    "one can speculate that the increase in the number of anti - crossing can have a beneficial effect on the hardest instances .",
    "for these instances , the minimum gap is generally very small so the system is very likely to transition away from the ground state during its evolution .",
    "modifying the spectrum by adding extra anti - crossings with comparably small gaps provides the system with further opportunities to transition back to the ground state , thereby correcting the earlier errors and improving the final success probability .",
    "this phenomenon bears a similarity to the observation reported in @xcite , where for some very hard instances of the max 2sat problem , it was found beneficial to start the annealing from the first excited state of the beginning hamiltonian instead of the usual choice of the ground state .    note that , without prior knowledge of the spectrum , this mechanism can improve or worsen the final success probability on a random basis ,",
    "hence it provides enhancement for only a small percentage of lucky instances that can take advantage of it .",
    "however , since the initial success probabilities in these cases are often very small , the resulting improvement due to this process can be significant and this is consistent with our observations .",
    "in this work we provided an example of a systematic study of the performance of quantum annealers with non - stoquastic hamiltonians in finding the ground states of certain long - range ising spin glass problems .",
    "we constructed two different non - stoquastic hamiltonians by adding purely antiferromagnetic , as well as mixed - sign driver terms of the form @xmath83 to the annealing schedule .",
    "we then compared their performance against the performance of a stoquastic hamiltonian with ferromagnetic couplings in addition to a pure transverse field annealing hamiltonian .",
    "we observed that for subsets of instances of our spin glass problem both stoquastic and non - stoquastic hamiltonians with coupled drivers improve the performance of quantum annealing done with the traditionally studied transverse - field driving .",
    "however , the numbers of the affected instances and the actual improvement obtained from stoquastic and non - stoquastic hamiltonians follow different trends .    for stoquastic hamiltonians with coupled drivers we see that the fraction of the affected instances is large and it increases as the system size grows",
    ". a closer look at the specific instances for which @xmath69 provides the best improvement reveals that the majority of such instances are quite easy for @xmath16 and the addition of the extra coupled terms in @xmath69 on average provides marginal improvement to the final success probabilities .",
    "an examination of the minimum gaps for these instances shows that the majority of them have large initial gaps under @xmath16 and the average size of the gaps increases once @xmath69 is applied .",
    "finally we observe that the numbers of anti - crossings between the first two instantaneous energy levels in this case decrease or remain the same for the majority of instances .",
    "the decrease in the number of anti - crossings and the general increase in the size of the gap , which can be explained using a mean - field description , provide a straightforward explanation for the performance of the stoquastic hamiltonian with coupled driver terms .    for non - stoquastic hamiltonians",
    "we see that the fractions of affected instances are much smaller than the stoquastic case and they remain relatively constant as the system size varies . in this case",
    "we see that the majority of the affected instances are hard for @xmath16 and the addition of the extra coupled terms can provide significant improvement to the success probabilities of these instances .",
    "we observe that in this case the average minimum gap does not change significantly but the average number of anti - crossings resulting from each hamiltonian clearly increases .",
    "we believe that the increase in the number of anti - crossings can , on a random basis , improve the success probability of the hardest instances with tiny minimum gaps .",
    "this work is a starting point for a series of deeper investigators into the potential advantages of non - stoquastic hamiltonians and the mechanisms responsible for their performance .",
    "a promising future direction is to carry out a more detailed study of non - stoquastic hamiltonians with mixed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings .",
    "it is interesting to understand whether optimized coupling signs can lead to further improvement in the performance of quantum annealers and to probe deeper into the mechanism behind their performance .",
    "other generalizations of our results along various lines can also be foreseen .",
    "for example , it is important to study the effect of optimizing the annealing schedule and the annealing time based on system size in the performance of quantum annealers for various problem hamiltonians",
    ". it is also interesting to study the performance of other non - stoquastic hamiltonians where the driving terms are of the form @xmath84 .",
    "these coupling terms can naturally emerge in some specific qubit architectures , but their effect on the annealing process is unknown to date . finally , it would also be important to study the effects of interactions with the environment and coupling with a dissipative bath , thus going beyond the unitary - dynamics setting of this work .    discussions and correspondences with s. bravyi , p. cappellaro , c. chamon , e. crosson , e. farhi , a. harrow , h. katzgraber , j. kerman , h. nishimori , a. polkovnikov , a. sandvik and i. zintchenko at various stages of this work are gratefully acknowledged .",
