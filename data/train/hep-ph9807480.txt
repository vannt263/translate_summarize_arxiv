    "despite the successful confirmation of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics by experimental precision tests during the past few years , the structure of the higgs sector has essentially remained unexplored , and there is still plenty of room for extensions .",
    "a phenomenologically interesting extension of the sm higgs sector that keeps the electroweak @xmath4 parameter @xcite at unity in the born approximation , is obtained by adding a second complex isospin - doublet scalar field with opposite hypercharge .",
    "this leads to the two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "after the three massless goldstone bosons which emerge via the electroweak symmetry breaking are eaten up to become the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bosons , there remain five physical higgs scalars : the neutral cp - even @xmath7 and @xmath8 bosons , the neutral cp - odd @xmath9 boson , and the charged @xmath10-boson pair . in order to avoid flavour - changing neutral currents ,",
    "one usually assumes that all up - type fermions couple to one of the higgs doublets while all down - type fermions couple to the other one ( 2hdm of type  ii ) .",
    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) consists of such a 2hdm of type  ii . at the tree level , the mssm higgs sector has two free parameters , which are usually taken to be the mass @xmath11 of the @xmath9 boson and the ratio @xmath12 of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets .",
    "the search for higgs bosons and the study of their properties are among the prime objectives of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a proton - proton colliding - beam facility with centre - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "the dominant decay modes of @xmath10 boson in this mass range are @xmath19 and @xmath20 unless @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the sm top - quark events , this signature violates lepton universality , a criterion which is routinely applied in ongoing @xmath10-boson searches at the fermilab @xmath22 collider tevatron @xcite . for larger values of @xmath23 ,",
    "the most copious sources of @xmath10 bosons are provided by @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , and the charge - conjugate subprocesses .",
    "the preferred decay channels are then @xmath27 and @xmath28 , independently of @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "@xmath35 pair production , which proceeds at the tree level via the drell - yan process @xmath36 , where a photon and a @xmath6-boson are exchanged in the @xmath37 channel @xcite , , there are additional feynman diagrams involving the top quark in the @xmath38 channel and the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 bosons in the @xmath37 channel . ] and at one loop via @xmath2 fusion @xmath39 @xcite , is also severely plagued by such qcd backgrounds .",
    "an attractive way out is to produce the @xmath10 bosons in association with @xmath40 bosons , so that the leptonic decays of the latter may serve as a spectacular trigger for the @xmath10-boson search .",

    "@xcite , for @xmath43 . in this approximation , the @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 couplings , which are large for @xmath47 , are nullified , and the @xmath48 coupling is wrongly suppressed for @xmath47 .",

    "one expects the integrated luminosity per year and experiment then to be as high as @xmath55  fb@xmath15 , so that this process might provide an interesting alternative , for moderate values of @xmath23 , besides the usual @xmath10-production mechanism via top - quark decay .",
    "the literature also contains a discussion of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "however , since the top quark turned out to be so heavy , this process is less interesting due to the substantial phase - space suppression relative to @xmath57 .    as for @xmath1 annihilation",
    ", it should be noted that the treatment of bottom as an active flavour inside the colliding hadrons leads to an effective description , which comprises contributions from the higher - order subprocesses @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . if all these subprocesses are to be explicitly included along with @xmath41 , then it is necessary to employ a judiciously subtracted bottom pdf in order to avoid double counting @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath41 with an unsubtracted bottom pdf is expected to slightly overestimate the true cross section @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we shall nevertheless adopt this effective approach in our analysis , keeping in mind that a qcd - correction factor below unity is to be applied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : two ] , we shall present some analytic results for the cross section of @xmath3 associated hadroproduction via @xmath1 annihilation and @xmath2 fusion in the 2hdm and outline our calculation of the box amplitude . in section",
    "[ sec : three ] , we shall quantitatively analyze the size of this cross section and estimate the number of expected signal events at the lhc and the upgraded tevatron . section  [ sec : four ] contains our conclusions .",

    "the mandelstam variables @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 at the parton level are thus related to @xmath74 , @xmath54 , and @xmath53 by @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , respectively . notice that @xmath78 . in the parton model ,",

    "it is interesting to compare @xmath1 annihilation and @xmath2 fusion with regard to their kinematic behaviour .",

    "[ fig : four](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , assuming @xmath146 , 6 , 30 and @xmath155  gev . in general , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cross sections have similar line shapes and just differ in their overall normalizations . in the case of @xmath2 fusion , it is instructive to analyze the interplay of @xmath141 and @xmath142 . figure  [ fig : five ] compares the @xmath2-fusion results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three](b ) with the respective contributions proportional to @xmath156 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : xs ] ) ] and @xmath157 .",
    "the latter two are comparable in size and up to one order of magnitude larger than the full result .",
    "obviously , there is a strong destructive interference between @xmath124 and @xmath122 . for a typical mssm scenario @xcite with @xmath29 and @xmath23 in the ranges considered here , the relative shift in the @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) cross section due to the mssm radiative corrections @xcite does not exceed the order of 10% ( 1% ) in magnitude .    as advertized in section  [ sec : one ] , one of the phenomenological advantages of @xmath3 associated production is the circumstance that the charged leptons originating from the decaying @xmath5 bosons can be utilized as a clean trigger .",
    "isolated , energetic electrons and muons will be hard to miss , and @xmath158 leptons should be identifiable with high efficiency via their one - prong decays to electrons , muons , charged pions , or charged kaons , which have a combined branching fraction of about 85% @xcite .",
    "thus , approximately 30% of the @xmath3 signal events should be more or less straightforwardly detectable in this way . if we assume the integrated luminosity per year to be at its design value of @xmath14  fb@xmath15 for each of the two lhc experiments , atlas and cms , then a cross section of 1  fb translates into about 60 detectable @xmath3 events per year .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] , we thus conclude that , depending on @xmath29 , one should be able to collect an annual total of between 650 and 14,000 such events if @xmath155  gev .",
    "we now turn to @xmath22 collisions at the tevatron with @xmath159  tev ( run  ii ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] , the total cross sections due to @xmath1 annihilation and @xmath2 fusion are presented as functions of @xmath23 for @xmath146 , 6 , and 30 . during run  ii",
    ", the tevatron , supplemented by the main injector and the recycler , is expected to deliver an integrated luminosity of @xmath55  fb@xmath15 per year to each of the two detectors , cdf and d0 .",
    "assuming that the @xmath10 bosons can be identified via their decays to @xmath158 leptons and that the @xmath5 bosons can also be recognized if they decay hadronically , by requiring that the two - jet invariant mass be close to @xmath160 , a cross section of 1  fb hence corresponds to about 20 detectable @xmath3 events during five years of operation . from fig .",
    "[ fig : six ] , we read off that , depending on @xmath29 , the total yield during that period should range between 5 and 50 if @xmath153  gev .",
    "finally , we should compare our analysis with the one reported in ref .  @xcite .",
    "if we adopt the input information from ref .",
    "@xcite , we are able to nicely reproduce the results obtained therein , except that our @xmath2-fusion cross section turns out to be a factor of two larger .",
    "a possible interpretation of this difference is that , in contrast to the case of @xmath1 annihilation , the results for @xmath2 fusion shown in figs .",
    "4 and 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite actually refer to one of the @xmath143 and @xmath144 final states rather than to their sum as declared in the text .",
    "we studied @xmath3 associated hadroproduction within the mssm , allowing for @xmath29 to be arbitrary .",
    "we included the contributions from @xmath1 annihilation and @xmath2 fusion to lowest order .",
    "for @xmath161 , the @xmath92-dependent terms in the relevant yukawa couplings give rise to significant effects in both channels and must not be neglected . in particular , the @xmath37-channel diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] would otherwise be missed .",
    "we also incorporated the leading corrections to the relations between the relevant mssm parameters @xcite .",
    "using up - to - date information on the input parameters and proton pdf s , we presented theoretical predictions for the @xmath3 production cross section at lhc and tevatron energies .",
    "apart from the fully integrated cross section , we also analyzed distributions in @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "a favourable scenario for @xmath3 associated hadroproduction would be characterized by the conditions that @xmath162 and that @xmath29 is either close to unity or of order @xmath163 .",
    "then , the @xmath10 bosons could not spring from on - shell top quarks , which are so copiously produced at hadron colliders , and their decays to @xmath158 leptons , which are relatively easy to identify , would have a small branching fraction . on the other hand , @xmath3 production would have a sizeable cross section , and the leptonic @xmath5 decays would provide a spectacular trigger .",
