    "the spatial shift at 690  ghz indicates a problem with the phase transfer at 690  ghz , probably due to uncertainties in the measured baseline and/or larger distance of ngc  253 to the phase calibrator ; the baseline error is around 0.3@xmath35 at 690  ghz .",

all four frequencies and table  [ tab2.5 ] the individual fluxes per beam for each continuum peak . assuming no significant resolution effects , the different fluxes indicate a total spectral index of @xmath403 ( for @xmath41 ) , see also fig .",
    "this is consistent with the spectral index found between the 1.3  mm and 0.87  mm continuum emission by @xcite and between the 2.6  mm and 1.3  mm continuum by @xcite .",
    "this strongly indicates that the emission at @xmath42115  ghz is largely dominated by thermal dust emission . our new 690  ghz data , along with the alma 115  ghz data ,",

    "[ fig2.5 ] plots the continuum sed for each of the continuum peaks normalized to the peak flux at 220  ghz for each component .",
    "while it is true that along l4-l7 the ratios do not change too much , yielding still an index around 3 , at least for the higher frequencies , it increases to @xmath14 - 5 at l2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this appears to be consistent with the overabundance of @xmath0co(j=76 ) found by @xcite suggesting a warmer dust component in this region .",
    "the latter would add to a higher flux of the 690  ghz continuum emission assuming a two temperature phase of the dust here .",
    "also , we see a slight drop of the spectral index with respect to the 2.6  mm continuum which most likely indicates the increasing role of non - thermal synchrotron and thermal free - free continuum emission towards longer wavelengths ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2.5 ] ) ; @xcite and @xcite find a probably equal contribution between non - thermal synchrotron radio emission presumably from supernova remnants and thermal free - free radio emission from hii regions , i.e. , star formation .",
    "@xcite derive a spectral index of @xmath1 @xmath43 for the radio continuum emission at cm wavelengths in the center which steepens to @xmath44 toward the outer parts and filaments .",
    "judging from figure  9 in @xcite , l5 and l6 show a spectral index of around @xmath290.5 , while l2 , l4 and l7 increase to around @xmath291 , explaining the differences in the deviations of the 115  ghz continuum from the thermal ( sub)mm ( modified black body ) slope for the different components .",
    "depending on the component and assumed spectral index , the synchrotron / free - free emission contributes between 15% and 80% to the 115  ghz continuum emission , with l2 having the least ( 15% ) and l5 and l7 ( @xmath180% ) having the most contribution from these radio ( cm / mm ) processes to their 2.6  mm continuum emission .",
    "however , if the synchrotron / free - free spectral indices are somewhat flatter or steeper , the fraction of this emission to the total continuum emission will change accordingly ( being higher or lower , respectively ) .",
    "given that generally ( but not exclusively ) the radio spectra of non - thermal synchrotron continuum emission is steeper ( i.e. , @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) than that of the thermal free - free continuum emission , it might be likely that the continuum emission at 2.6  mm has a larger contribution of thermal free - free emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "however , this might change from clump to clump within the disk and we have no actual way to distinguish between non - thermal synchrotron and thermal free - free emission from our continuum observations other than the spectral radio index ( which might be misleading ) .",
    "therefore , we will not further stress a differentiation between the two processes .      while fitting a simple power law to the ( sub-)millimeter dust emission is a reasonable first - order approach , we can actually do better and determine the temperature , opacity and dust mass from our observations , using standard equations ( for a comparison on similar observations and sources see also the recent work on 690  ghz alma data for arp220 by * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . by using flux ratios",
    ", we can eliminate some assumptions such as on the dust emissivity , in particular to derive the dust opacities and dust temperatures ( but see also further below for the dust mass for which this approach does not work ) .",
    "this gives the following equation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath47    using the flux densities of the emission at 220  ghz , 350  ghz and 686  ghz , this allows us to derive the opacities and dust temperatures in the different peaks , as shown in fig.[fig2.5 ] along with the @xmath48-fits .",
    "we assumed a spectral index of the dust emissivity of 1.8 ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and varied the dust temperatures in the range of 2.5  k up to 150  k and opacities at 220  ghz between 0.02 and 1 ( corresponding to opacities at 686  ghz of @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath10.15 to 8) .",
    "the best - fit solutions suggest dust temperatures of @xmath110 - 30  k at low opacities of @xmath50=0.19 for all five peaks , with l2 having the highest t@xmath51 of 25  k. however , l4 and l5 have almost equally low-@xmath48 solutions at higher t@xmath52 and much higher opacities of @xmath50=4 while the opacities of l2 stay consistently below 1 .",

    "this highlights the fact that at each position we probably see an ensemble of different gmcs which likely exhibit slightly different excitation conditions ( see also table  [ tab4.5 ] ) .",
    "however , the differences are not very large so probably all of these gmcs are exposed to the same major heating source , the starburst and its winds / shocks .    while we can not identify any significant difference in the ratios between the peaks along the disk ( see also columns 3 - 9 in table  [ tab4 ] & [ tab4.5 ] , as well as fig .  [ fig9.5 ] ) , the temperature ratios are significantly lower close to the eastern shell sb2 indicating much warmer ( and/or denser ) material there ( similar to the continuum emission ) and slightly higher ratios toward the western shell sb1 indicating less warm ( or less dense ) gas there ( see figs .",
    "[ fig9.0 ] , [ fig9.5 ] and [ fig13.0 ] ) .",
    "this difference in gas excitation between the two shells is quite surprising if one assumes a similar nature / origin of the two .",
    "however , there are some indications that the two shells are probably caused by different mechanisms : sb2 is associated with winds from a stellar cluster while sb1 is associated with a supernova remnant .",
    "the energetic output of a supernova is probably quite different from the stellar winds from star - formation / star - bursts in a stellar cluster so that a different feedback to the surrounding molecular gas is to be expected ( see also section  3.2.4 ) .",
    "another explanation could be that these shells are at different evolutionary stages , although they appear to exhibit a similar extent and expansion velocities ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) if one believes that sb1 is an expanding superbubble . as @xcite expressed doubts about sb1 being a superbubble as opposed to sb2 , sb1 might have a much different origin hence naturally explaining the different ratios and subsequently different excitation conditions in these two regions .",
    "however , we have to apply some caution in interpreting these ratios as we do not have exactly the same uv - coverages in the different @xmath0co transitions , with @xmath0co(j=65 ) probably being the least well sampled and the least sensitive .",
    "we already discussed the effect of spatial filtering flux in a previous section and found that resolution effects are possibly minor along the disk but could be more important in the region of the shells .",
    "therefore , we think that the ratios along the disk are likely very representative while for the shells we probably need more sensitive observations of a larger field with better uv coverage , as is becoming possible with alma .",

    "* ) applying a reduced @xmath48 minimization method to fit the basic excitation conditions of the molecular gas in the western and eastern shells and the ( averaged ) disk .",
    "we first considered a one phase gas model , i.e. , gas at one kinetic temperature , one h@xmath5 density and one co column density .",
    "we thereby varied the temperatures by t@xmath9310 - 400  k , the densities by n@xmath9410@xmath20 - 10@xmath70  @xmath95 and the column densities by n@xmath9610@xmath97 - 10@xmath98  @xmath99 for a line width of dv=100  kms@xmath15 ( see also * ? ? ? * ) and a uniform sphere , linearly splitting up the parameter space in 41 `` bins '' with steps of 10  k for t@xmath100 and 0.1  dex for n@xmath101 and n@xmath102 .",

    "we also ran a two - temperature phase gas model for the eastern shell similar to the disk but we did not find a solution in which the @xmath0co(j=21 ) emission was correctly reproduced .",
    "the best fit solutions of the two - temperature phase models largely resembled the one - temperature phase models so that we hence decided to keep the one - temperature phase model for the eastern shell for simplicity reasons .",
    "either we are seeing ( part of ) the warm component from the disk only here or additional excitation mechanisms have to be considered .",
    "studies of spatially resolved , multi - transition ( @xmath115 ) @xmath0co emission in galaxies are still very rare .",
    "most of them are conducted with single dish telescopes that provide sufficient angular resolution to resolve gmc scales ( @xmath11650 - 100pc ) only in the most nearby galaxies or our own galaxy , if at all .",
    "we picked several @xmath0co ladder studies in order to compare them to the results obtained on ngc  253 @xcite .",
    "the studied objects span from gmcs in the galactic center , over nearby starburst and/or agn galaxies such as ngc6946 , m82 and ngc  1068 to ulirgs like arp  220 and mrk  231 and high - redshift galaxies .",
    "+   + _ disk : _ interestingly , all studies , i.e. , for all ( active ) environments in our vicinity up to the high - redshift universe , seem to need a multi - phase gas model ( with at least a high and lower temperature gas component ) to be able to reproduce the observed multi - transition co emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , similar to the central disk in ngc  253 . also , most of them find that besides photoelectric heating from uv radiation in pdrs also mechanical heating through low - velocity shocks have to be considered as almost equally dominant mechanism to heat the molecular gas ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in all these regions , cosmic rays do not seem to contribute significantly to the heating of the warm molecular gas component , agreeing with the findings by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "ngc  253 has known supernova explosions at a rate of @xmath160.2  yr@xmath15 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , more importantly , a median cosmic ray ionisation rate of @xmath1176@xmath118 @xcite .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath1100 - 1000 higher than found in the vicinity of sgr  a@xmath119 @xcite and of the order of the x - ray(/cosmic ray ) ionisation rates of @xmath4210@xmath120s@xmath15 found in the ( u)lirgs arp  220 and ngc  4418 @xcite .",
    "@xcite mention that already a cosmic ray ionisation rate of @xmath121 can heat the gas up to @xmath12210  k and @xcite conclude that `` cosmic ray penetration and heating is an important contributor to warm temperatures observed in starburst galaxies '' .",
    "although the simulations conducted by @xcite favor a minor role of cosmic ray heating , it probably can not be completely excluded at this point . moreover , in the case of the ulirg mrk  231 , @xcite find indications that , besides pdr heating , x - ray(/cosmic ray ) heating is a significant contributor in order to explain their two - temperature phase model of the multi - transition co emission although they do not include shock models in their simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite find in the case of arp  220 that mechanical heating should be largely dominating over that by pdr , xdr and cosmic rays , at least for the warm molecular gas .",
    "this result might be logical as arp  220 is a known major merger in an evolved merging stage so that mechanical heating should be quite significant .",
    "although in a slightly earlier merger stage than arp  220 , @xcite argue for a ( low velocity , c - type ) shock domination of the gas heating in ngc  6240 as well , similar to arp  220 .",
    "in contrast to ngc  1068 , whose molecular gas in its central @xmath1200pc disk is most likely dominated by a combination of ( low velocity ) shocks and a giant xdr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the line transition ratios in ngc  253 decrease ( assuming co(j@xmath123-j@xmath124)/co(j=1@xmath290 ) ; with j@xmath125 ) while those for ngc  1068 increase .",
    "this is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of the @xmath0co line ratios for xdrs and pdrs @xcite , even in the case of a strong cosmic ray ionisation field in addition to a pdr .",
    "another interesting difference to note is that ngc  1068 indeed shows variations of its line ratios the closer one gets to the nucleus ( central 50  pc or so ) as revealed by recent alma observations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while the disk ( central 500  pc ) appears to be dominated by the same heating source .",
    "hence , a starburst influences its surrounding gas on a much larger scale than an agn seems to do .",
    "+   + _ shells : _ based on the discussion of the heating mechanisms responsible for the co ladder in diverse environments , one can draw some first conclusions on the dominant heating mechanisms for the two shells by simple comparison . as mentioned before , probably only mechanical energy from shocks or turbulent gas can heat up the bulk of molecular gas significantly above 50  k , while photo - electric ( pdr ) and/or cosmic ray heating dominates the cold to warm gas component . our data quite clearly indicate that the eastern shell is much warmer than the disk and the western shell while being at similar gas and column densities",
    ". this could be hence an indication that shocks might play a much more dominant role in the eastern shell , associated with a compact stellar cluster , than in the pdr+shock dominated disk and the western shell which might be connected to a supernova remnant .",
    "it appears rather unlikely that a strong pdr ( or cosmic rays ) also has to be considered for the eastern shell which could explain the stronger emission in the higher - j transitions in it compared to the disk ; the higher - j co transitions are more dominantly excited than the lower - j co transitions .",
    "our data suggest that the western shell is much colder than the eastern shell and the hot gas component of the disk but is still warmer than the cold gas component of the disk . one conclusion , although certainly quite speculative at this point , is that the cosmic rays from the supernova remnant dominate the gas excitation in the western shell and that the ( low - velocity ) shocks , if they exist , from the sn explosion have not yet or only very inefficiently heated the gas to the same high temperatures as found in the ( warm component of the ) disk or the eastern shell .",
    "however , given the similar extent of both shells , it is not intuitive why shocks play such a minor role in the western shell compared to the eastern shell and the disk . also , while it is true that sn have been identified through radio observations in the western shell , the lack of radio detections in the eastern shell does not exclude sn in it",
    ". further observations of either @xmath0co or other shock and cosmic ray tracers have to be conducted to unveil the heating mechanisms in these shells at a sufficient confidence level .",
    "we presented new interferometric observations of the extended @xmath0co(j=65 ) line and 686  ghz continuum emission in ngc  253 carried out as a five point mosaic with the sma .",
    "these data were then compared to three lower - j @xmath0co transitions ( j=10 , j=21 , j=32 ) and continuum emission at lower frequencies at similar angular resolution of @xmath1 4@xmath2 observed with alma and the sma .",
    "five of the eight @xmath0co line peaks find counterparts in the mm and submm continuum emission underlying the thermal nature of the continuum emission from dust as suggested by the spectral index of 3 determined from the different frequencies .",
    "the continuum emission at the lowest frequency of 115  ghz appears to exhibit already a significant contribution from non - thermal synchrotron and thermal free - free processes ( between 15 - 80% ) as supported by the spectral indices derived at cm wavelengths .",
    "we derive dust temperatures of @xmath110 - 25  k for the different continuum peaks in the disk with low opacities of @xmath10.2 at 686  ghz .",
    "however , we also find indications for a hotter dust component at least in the inner disk of ngc  253 with dust temperatures exceeding 60  k and at much larger opacities of around 4 at 686  ghz .",
    "the latter dust component approaches the values found for ulirgs such as arp  220 .",
    "we estimate a total dust mass of a few 10@xmath7  m@xmath8 for the entire disk , splitting up into @xmath110@xmath126 - 10@xmath127 for the gmcs at the individual continuum peaks . based on the gas masses of each of the peaks , we find a gas - to - dust mass ratio of the order of @xmath1100 - 1000 .",
    "the @xmath0co(j=65 ) emission follows nicely the distribution of the molecular gas seen in the lower - j transitions with roughly eight peaks along the disk .",
    "only few @xmath0co(j=65 ) emission is detected close to the two shells emerging from the edges of the central disk .",
    "while the @xmath0co line transition ratios do not vary significantly along the disk , the two shells show quite different ratios not only compared to the disk but also to each other .",
    "the line ratios found along the disk seem to necessitate a two - phase gas model in agreement with previous studies on ngc  253 as well as multiple-@xmath0co observations on other active galaxies .",
    "this two - phase gas model is mainly based on two temperatures , a cool gas component at around t@xmath4=10  k and hot gas component at around t@xmath4=300  k. following a similar argumentation to previous publications , the lower temperature gas is probably dominated by the pdr while the higher temperature gas is a consequence of the shocks found throughout the disk ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , a possible contribution from cosmic rays , given the high cosmic ray ionisation rate within the disk , can not be completely excluded for either temperature phase at this point although some simulations indicate only a minor role of cosmic ray heating ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the eastern shell exhibits even warmer gas ( t@xmath3300  k ) with respect to the hot gas ( t@xmath111300  k ) component of the disk , the western shell contains gas much cooler ( t@xmath11160  k ) than the eastern shell but somewhere in between the two temperature gas components of the disk ( t@xmath12810  k and t@xmath129300  k ) ; the gas densities ( n(h@xmath5)@xmath235@xmath1010@xmath130  @xmath95 ) and column densities ( n(co)@xmath2310@xmath72  @xmath99 ) are very similar between the two shells and the disk .",
    "this reflects either a different evolutionary stage of the shells , an additional , different or more efficient heating mechanism in the eastern shell , a very different nature of these two structures , or a combination thereof .",
    "however , follow - up observations are mandatory to put our findings for the shells onto a more solid basis .",
