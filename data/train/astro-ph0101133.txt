    "in addition to local sources of perturbation , the molecular gas responds to large scale variations in the galaxy such as spiral potentials and the surface density of stars and gas ( elmegreen 1989 ) .",
    "these different environments and conditions regulate the stability of the gas and therefore , modulate the formation of stars .",
    "therefore , it is important to evaluate the molecular gas properties over a wide range of environments .",
    "a general description of the molecular interstellar medium requires surveys of molecular line emission over large volumes of the galaxy with high angular and spectral resolution and sampling .",
    "such surveys provide a census of the molecular gas without an undue bias toward bright emission or association with active sites of star formation .",
    "the subsequent large number of molecular regions identified in wide field surveys enable a statistical evaluation of gas properties and classification with respect to the local environment .",
    "there have been several important wide field surveys of co emission from the galaxy .",
    "the large scale distribution of molecular gas in the milky way has been determined from the combined north - south surveys summarized by dame et  al .",

    "many of the accepted characteristics of the molecular interstellar medium are derived from these studies .",
    "these include the self gravitational equilibrium state of the giant molecular clouds and the relationship between the velocity dispersion and size of the cloud . however , cloud properties determined from inner galaxy surveys are compromised due to the high degree of confusion along the line of sight due to velocity crowding which precludes a complete accounting of the emission ( lizst & burton 1981 ) . to reduce the blending of emission from unrelated clouds ,",
    "molecular regions are identified as high temperature isophotes within the longitude - latitude-  volume .",
    "while the large temperature thresholds reduce the confusion along the line of sight , these necessarily bias the resultant cloud catalogs to the warmest , densest regions within the molecular interstellar medium .",
    "and  imaging observations of targeted clouds demonstrate that most of the molecular mass resides within the extended , low column density lines of sight ( carpenter , snell & schloerb 1995 ; heyer , carpenter & ladd 1996 ) .",
    "such low column density regions in the inner galaxy are simply not accessible for the analysis of cloud properties .    in contrast",
    ", the outer galaxy provides a less confusing view of the molecular interstellar medium . beyond the solar circle",
    ", there is no blending of emission from widely separated clouds along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , molecular regions can be identified at lower gas column densities from which more representative global properties can be derived .",
    "this property has been exploited in a series of investigations by brand & wouterloot ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "while these studies provide a sensitive , high resolution perspective of individual clouds and the distribution of molecular regions in the far outer galaxy , the results are necessarily biased toward clouds associated with star formation .",
    "the fcrao co survey of the outer galaxy provides an opportunity to study the equilibrium state of molecular clouds under varying conditions ( heyer et  al .",

    "luminosity , size , and line width distributions are determined from the ensemble of identified objects located in the perseus arm and far outer galaxy . in @xmath113 , we reexamine the larson scaling relationships with the cloud catalog extracted from the survey and with clumps from a similar decomposition of  and observations of several targeted giant molecular clouds .",
    "to isolate discrete regions of co emission from the large data cube , we have adopted the definition of a molecular cloud used by previous investigations ( solomon et  al .",
    "1987 ; scoville et  al .  1987 ; sodroski 1991 ) .",
    "that is , a discrete molecular region is identified as a closed topological surface within the @xmath12 data cube at a given threshold of antenna temperature . in this study ,",
    "the limiting threshold is 1.4 k ( main beam temperature scale ) or 1.5@xmath10 where @xmath10 is the median rms value of antenna temperatures in the survey ( heyer et  al .",
    "the threshold value is sufficiently low to provide a more complete accounting of the flux within the data cube as compared to the inner galaxy surveys , while large enough to exclude misidentifications of molecular regions due to statistical noise .",
    "detailed descriptions of the cloud decomposition and the calculation of cloud properties are provided in appendix a.      the decomposition of the fcrao co survey of the outer galaxy at a limiting threshold of = 1.4 k yields 10156 objects .",
    "each object is described by position centroids ( @xmath13 ) , velocity width , , a kinematic distance , d , assuming purely circular motions and a flat rotation curve,=220 ; @xmath14=8.5 kpc ] galactocentric radius , r@xmath15 , z height , co luminosity , , and a peak antenna temperature within the surface , .",
    "the geometry of an object is described by major and minor axis diameters , , , and a position angle , @xmath16 , of the major axis with respect to the galactic plane ( see appendix a ) . all sizes are derived assuming a kinematic distance to the object .",
    "the derived properties of the identified objects are listed in table  1 .",
    "objects in the catalog are named hcs followed by the sequential catalog number .    for much of the subsequent analysis",
    ", we exclude molecular regions with @xmath17 - 20  since the kinematic distances are not sufficiently accurate for such local emission .",
    "the gas in the outer galaxy is known to exhibit large deviations from circular motions ( brand & blitz 1993 ) .",
    "for example , the ic1805 ob cluster has a spectroscopic distance of 2.35 kpc which corresponds to a circular velocity of -20 .",
    "the bulk of the co emission occurs at  of -40 to -50 with a kinematic distance of 4 - 5 kpc .",
    "such discrepancies have been attributed to streaming motions of the gas in response to the spiral potential or a triaxial spheroid ( blitz & spergel 1991 ) . in the survey field ,",
    "kinematic distances can be larger than the spectroscopic distances by factors of 2 .",
    "therefore , in some cases , co luminosities and inferred molecular hydrogen masses may _ overestimate _ the true values by factors of 3 to 4 . the restricted subset with @xmath18 -20",
    "is comprised of 3901 objects with kinematic distances greater than @xmath192 kpc and galactocentric radii greater than @xmath199.5 kpc .",
    "the decomposition extracts both isolated molecular clouds and clumps within larger cloud complexes which are identified separately due to the spatial and kinematic inhomogeneity of the molecular interstellar medium .",
    "any element within the data cube can only be assigned to a singular object .",
    "figure  [ survey.clouds ] shows an image of integrated intensity over the velocity range -110 to -20 and the ensemble of identified objects whose positions , inferred sizes and orientations are represented as ellipses with parameters , , and @xmath16 .      prior to the examination of cloud properties , it is necessary to establish known selection effects .",
    "the primary selection effects are due to the limited spectral resolution of the observations , the antenna temperature threshold , and the requirement that an object be comprised of at least 5 spatial pixels ( see appendix a ) .",
    "the antenna temperatures of two contiguous spectroscopic channels are required to be larger than the main beam temperature threshold of 1.4 k in order for these channels to be associated with an object .",
    "therefore , the cloud catalog does not include molecular regions with narrow ( @xmath20 @xmath4 0.4 ) velocity dispersions . in appendix b",
    ", we evaluate the sensitivity and accuracy of the method from the cloud decomposition of simple cloud models with varying signal to noise and line width .",
    "the decomposition can recover velocity dispersions as small as 0.65  to within 10% accuracy for signal to noise ratios greater than 4 .",
    "the results are important not only to gauge the selection of objects but to evaluate the cloud scaling laws discussed in @xmath113 .    given the antenna temperature threshold of 1.4 k and assuming that is universally optically thick , the decomposition can not recover regions with extreme subthermal excitation conditions averaged over the angular extent of the cloud .",
    "the intensity threshold and spectroscopic channel requirements correspond to an h@xmath21 column density of 4@xmath610@xmath22 @xmath23 ( see @xmath112.4 ) at which self shielding of co molecules may not be effective ( van dishoeck & black 1988 ) .",
    "therefore , the edges defined by this threshold likely correspond to a photodissociation boundary of co. the distribution of  gas is likely more extended than the co. independent of excitation , the catalog would not include small , compact clouds with mean angular radii less than @xmath192 arcminutes due to the requirement that the cloud is comprised of at least five pixels .",
    "due to the prescribed definition of a cloud , there are limits to physical quantities such as size and co luminosity below which the cloud catalog is insensitive and incomplete .",
    "figure  [ complete ] shows the effective cloud radius , @xmath24 and co luminosity as functions of the kinematic distance for all identified objects .",
    "the lower envelope of points corresponds to the minimum effective size of a cloud , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the solid angle per pixel , d is the distance to the object in kpc , and @xmath27 is the minimum number of pixels per object . for this decomposition , @xmath28 so that @xmath29 pc .",
    "similarly , the minimum co luminosity is , @xmath30 where @xmath31 , is the minimum number of velocity channels , @xmath32=0.81 , is the spectroscopic channel width , and @xmath33=1.4 k is the main beam antenna temperature threshold .",
    "@xmath34 is shown as the solid line in figure  [ complete ] . at a distance of 10 kpc , the detection limit is 67 @xmath35 . while @xmath34 is the detection limit at a given distance , d , the completeness limit is higher than this value since the noise of the data contributes to the measured luminosity .",
    "the completeness limit , @xmath36 is defined in this study at the 5@xmath10 confidence as @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath10=0.93 k is the median rms temperature for channels with no emission ( heyer et  al .",
    "1998 ) . at 10 kpc ,",
    "the cloud catalog is complete for co luminosities @xmath39 138 @xmath35 .",
    "this completeness limit needs to be considered when calculating power law descriptions to the co luminosity function in @xmath112.5.1 .",
    "whenever possible , descriptions of observable quantities are presented with few or no assumptions . however , for analyses described in @xmath113.2 and @xmath114.1 , it is necessary to derive total gas column densities and masses . in this investigation for which only  observations are available ,  column densities are derived using the co to  conversion factor determined from @xmath40-ray measurements such that @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the  integrated intensity in k km s@xmath43 for a given line of sight ( strong & mattox 1996 ) . summing over the projected area of the cloud , this corresponds to a conversion from co luminosity , , in @xmath35 to the total molecular mass , of the identified object , @xmath44 which includes the factor 1.36 to account for the abundances of heavier elements ( hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "the dimensional justification for a constant conversion factor is summarized by dickman , snell , & schloerb ( 1986 ) .",
    "the co luminosity is the integral of the antenna temperature over all velocities and area of the cloud , @xmath45 @xmath46 where da is the projected area of a pixel in pc@xmath9 , @xmath47 is the mean brightness temperature over the projected area and velocity interval , @xmath48 is the full width half maximum line width in @xmath49 , and @xmath50 is the effective radius in pc .",
    "the gravitational parameter , @xmath51 , for a spherically symmetric , uniform density cloud is @xmath52 where @xmath20 is is the velocity dispersion of the object .",
    "solving for @xmath53 in equation 2.8 and substituting into equation 2.7 , @xmath54 dividing equation 2.9 into @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mean density of the cloud yields @xmath57 , @xmath58",
    "@xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the conventional assumption is that clouds are self gravitational ( @xmath62 ) and the mean temperature and density do not vary from cloud to cloud such that @xmath57 is constant .",
    "however , if clouds are not gravitationally bound ( @xmath63 ) , then the appropriate value of @xmath57 decreases with respect to the value for a self gravitating cloud .",
    "therefore , by applying a constant , universal value of @xmath57 , under the assumption that @xmath64 , the resultant  mass _ overestimates _ the true mass of a cloud with @xmath63 .",
    "the large number of objects identified in the decomposition of the fcrao co survey of the outer galaxy enables a detailed examination of the co luminosity function , the size spectrum , and line width distribution of molecular regions .",
    "the mass spectrum of clouds , n(m)dm , within the galaxy and clumps within molecular cloud complexes is used as a diagnostic to cloud formation and fragmentation processes ( kwan 1979 ) ; a signature of a hierarchical interstellar medium ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ; stutzki et  al .",
    "1998 ) ; and a guide to the initial stellar mass function ( zinnecker et  al .  1993 ) .",
    "it is typically quoted as a differential distribution which is described by a power law , @xmath65 values for @xmath66 are similar for distributions describing clouds and cloud complexes in the galaxy or clumps within clouds .",
    "kramer et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) summarize the mass spectra of clumps within several cloud complexes .",
    "they find that @xmath66 ranges from 1.6 to 1.8 over a large range of mass scales . from a sample of giant molecular clouds identified within coarsely sampled surveys of co emission from the inner galaxy , sanders , scoville & solomon ( 1985 ) and solomon et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) derive @xmath67 . for these galactic surveys",
    ", the mass of a cloud is determined from the virial mass and the assumption of self gravitational equilibrium .",
    "figure  [ lco - function ] shows the differential luminosity function , @xmath68 , in equally spaced , logarithmic bins for objects with @xmath4 - 20 .",
    "the corresponding mass for a given  is shown along the top x coordinate assuming a constant co to h@xmath21 conversion factor ( see @xmath112.4 ) .",
    "the detection limit of the sample at a distance of 10 kpc is 67 @xmath35 .",
    "the sample is complete to a limiting value of 138 @xmath35 at a distance of 10 kpc .",
    "a power law is fit to the bins with  greater than this completeness limit and weighted by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of objects in each bin such that @xmath71 the value of the exponent is steeper than the value derived by brand & wouterloot ( 1995 ) for a sample of outer galaxy clouds for which @xmath66=1.62",
    ". this may be partly due to the improved statistics given the large number of objects and a lower luminosity completeness limit . nevertheless , the value of the exponent is less than the critical value of 2 , at which there are equal integrated luminosities ( masses ) over any logarithmic range of luminosity .",
    "therefore , most of the observed flux is contributed by the most luminous objects .",
    "for example , 50% of the luminosity integrated over all identified objects ( 3901 ) comes from 35 clouds with @xmath39 7800 @xmath35 and 90% is contributed by 930 clouds with @xmath39 270 @xmath35 .",
    "the size distribution of identified objects provides an additional measure of mean cloud properties .",
    "the differential size distribution , @xmath72 , is presented in figure  [ size - distr ] .",
    "the detection limit at a distance of 10 kpc is shown as the vertical dotted line .",
    "a power law fit to bins above this limit and weighted by @xmath73 , yields the relation , @xmath74 the size spectrum for the outer galaxy clouds is similar to that derived from inner galaxy surveys ( solomon et  al .",
    "1987 ) and targeted molecular regions over a more limited range of cloud size ( elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ) .",
    "each object is characterized by a velocity dispersion , @xmath75 , derived from the summed spectrum of all constituent pixels .",
    "this measure includes both line of sight motions as may be inferred from the mean line width of each profile and projected variations of the centroid velocities .",
    "therefore , it accounts for all of the measured kinetic energy within a cloud generated by turbulence , rotation , expansion , and other dynamical processes .",
    "the distribution of velocity dispersions , @xmath76 , is shown in figure  [ vw - distr ] .",
    "the decomposition is not sensitive to small line width regions and provides accurate measures for @xmath20 @xmath39 0.64 .",
    "the distribution of velocity dispersions for clouds with large peak temperatures ( @xmath39 3.5 k ) and presumably more accurate values of @xmath20 , shows the same shape and mean value as the distribution for all objects .",
    "the measured distribution of line width for all objects is not significantly biased by signal to noise or errors in measuring @xmath20 .",
    "with the statistics of individual properties established in the preceding sections , we now examine the relationships between various cloud properties .",
    "these relationships are motivated by the scaling laws initially identified by larson ( 1981 ) and reexamined by many subsequent studies with varying results .",
    "these scaling laws describe 1 ) a power law relationship between the velocity dispersion and size of a cloud ; 2 ) a linear correlation between the measured and virial mass of clouds ; and 3 ) an inverse relationship between mean density and size .",
    "the three relationships are algebraically coupled such that the validity of any two of these laws necessarily implies the third ( larson 1981 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion , @xmath20 , provides a measure of the total kinetic energy in the cloud inclusive of thermal , turbulent , rotational , and expanding motions .",
    "a scaling relationship between the velocity dispersion and the size of a cloud was initially identified by larson ( 1981 ) using data taken from the literature .",
    "a recent compilation of data from many studies using several different molecular line tracers demonstrates this correlation of velocity dispersion with size within 4 orders of magnitude in size scale ( falgarone 1996 ) .",
    "the origin of this relationship has been attributed to turbulence ( larson 1981 ; myers 1983 ) , or simply , a consequence of gravitational equilibrium and constant gas column density which are limited by observational selection effects ( scalo 1990 ) .",
    "it is important to distinguish the relationship derived using multitracer observations from that determined from a single gas tracer ( goodman et  al .",
    "the excitation requirements for a given molecule determine the angular extent over which any object can be identified .",
    "multitracer observations sample different density regimes which correspond to distinct , but nested , volumes of material . in this way",
    ", a larger dynamic range of sizes is probed than can be sampled by any single gas tracer .",
    "the correlation between velocity dispersion and size has been established for single gas tracers but over a more limited range of sizes and larger intrinsic scatter ( larson 1981 ; dame et  al .",
    "1987 ; solomon et  al .",
    "these single tracer relationships examine the variation of the velocity dispersion with size within a more limited range of density",
    ".    figure  [ vw - r ] presents the variation of velocity dispersion with the effective radius , @xmath77 , for the ensemble of clouds in this study .",
    "to more effectively consolidate the information , the mean velocity dispersion is calculated within binned cloud radii . for objects with sizes greater than @xmath197 pc , there is a tendency for increasing velocity dispersion with size .",
    "the slope of the power law fit to objects with radii greater than 9 pc is @xmath190.5 and similar to that derived by solomon et  al .",
    "( 1987 ) . however , the binned values show little systemic variation of the velocity dispersion with size for @xmath78 7 pc .",
    "the apparent flattening of the relationship for small clouds is not an artifact of our cloud definition since it occurs at a velocity dispersion for which our method is reasonably accurate ( see appendix b ) . a limited number of followup observations with much higher spectral resolution of narrow line width clouds identified in the catalog show comparable velocity dispersions ( see appendix b ) .",
    "a population of small clouds with line widths below our threshold for cloud identification which do follow the standard relationship can not be excluded .",
    "however , our observations have identified many small clouds with line widths in excess of the extrapolated size line - width relationship of solomon et  al .",
    "this result does not dismiss the velocity dispersion - size relationship determined from multitracer observations .",
    "narrow line width regions within molecular clouds are identified from tracers of high density gas ( nh@xmath79 , cs , hcn ) and these often follow the conventional scaling law ( myers 1983 ) .",
    "such regions are not readily identified by  or  emission .",
    "previous co studies which have identified a size line width scaling law have been limited to large , self gravitating cloud complexes with masses greater than 10@xmath3  ( solomon et  al .",
    "1987 , scoville et  al .",

    "we determine the magnitude of the virial mass with respect to the measured mass of the object derived from the co luminosity .",
    "following bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) , the virial mass , @xmath80 , is calculated from the measured cloud parameters , @xmath81 where @xmath75 is the one dimensional velocity dispersion .",
    "the constants , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , measure the effects of a nonuniform density distribution and clump axial ratio , respectively , on the gravitational potential and @xmath84 is a statistical correction to account for the projection of an ellipsoidal cloud .",
    "these constants are evaluated using the functional forms described in bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) and with the assumption of uniform density clouds ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the value of this combination of constants , ( @xmath86 ) , is @xmath191 .",
    "the gravitational parameter , @xmath87 provides a measure of the kinetic to gravitational energy density ratio . in the outer galaxy catalog",
    "for which there are only @xmath8co observations ,  is derived assuming a co to h@xmath21 conversion factor .",

    "the vertical line denotes the detection limit for l@xmath88 at a distance of 10 kpc .",
    "the derived values of the gravitational parameter are anti - correlated with the co luminosity . a bisector fit to the data yields the relationship @xmath89 with a correlation coefficient of -0.76 .",
    "this expression is parameterized in terms of mass assuming a constant co to  conversion factor , @xmath90 where @xmath91=1.3@xmath610@xmath3  and corresponds to the mass at which @xmath64 .",
    "this relationship could be due to the selection effect which excludes narrow line regions from the cloud catalog ( see @xmath92 ) .",
    "the minimum value of the gravitational parameter , @xmath93 , is estimated by solving for @xmath77 in equation 2.7 and inserting the result into equation 2.8 such that , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the minimum velocity dispersion recovered . for @xmath47=1.4",
    "k and @xmath20=0.43 , @xmath96 and is shown as the heavy line in figure  [ alphag ] .",
    "the functional form of @xmath93 provides a reasonable approximation to the lower envelope of points within the @xmath97 plane .",
    "therefore , a population of clouds with narrow line widths , low luminosities , and smaller values of @xmath51 could exist within the ism but is not recovered in this decomposition .",

    "accounting for a radial gradient in  abundance , they concluded that the conversion factor is similar to that found in the inner galaxy .",
    "other  and studies have found no significant variation of @xmath57 for outer galaxy clouds ( carpenter , snell , & schloerb 1990 ) .",
    "the conventional assumption of a constant conversion factor is that clouds are self gravitationally bound with @xmath62 .",
    "however , as discussed in @xmath112.4 , if clouds are internally overpressured with respect to self gravity ( @xmath98 ) , then the appropriate value of @xmath57 is smaller than the standard , constant value .",
    "therefore , by using the standard value , the derived masses are upper limits and the derived values for @xmath51 are lower limits .",

    "figure  [ xco ] shows the inferred co to   conversion factor , @xmath106 as a function of @xmath101 for the identified clumps within the four fields . while there are not many objects with high mass , the scatter of the ratio for objects with @xmath10710@xmath3 is much smaller than is found for low mass objects .",
    "the mean value for the high mass points is comparable to the value determined from @xmath40-ray measurements ( strong & mattox 1996 ) .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath57 for the lower mass , non - self - gravitating objects are smaller than this standard value as expected from equation 2.7 .",
    "these results are direct , empirical evidence that l@xmath88 is a reliable tracer of total mass of an object for values of l@xmath88 @xmath39 10@xmath5 k - km / s pc@xmath9 but provides only an upper limit to the mass for objects with lower luminosities .",
    "the main isotope of co provides the primary tracer of h@xmath21 mass in galaxies .",
    "this utility depends upon the state of self gravitational equilibrium of the constituent clouds within the observer s beam ( dickman , snell , & schloerb 1986 ) .",
    "the non - self gravitating state of low luminosity objects does not render the use of co as an extragalactic tracer of  mass inapplicable .",
    "figure  [ lco - function ] demonstrates that much of the measured co luminosity arises from the most massive objects within the field for which @xmath62 .",
    "given that  provides an upper limit to the mass for non - self gravitating clouds , the mass function may be even flatter than the luminosity function .",
    "for most available resolutions of a galaxy , the large , most luminous objects would contribute most of the detected flux .",
    "therefore , if the distribution of clouds in other galaxies is similar to the outer galaxy , then @xmath8co remains a reliable tracer of  mass .",
    "the fractional contribution to the measured co luminosity from the small , non self gravitating population of clouds would simply add to the scatter of inferred molecular hydrogen masses as this contribution could vary with position in a galaxy or from one galaxy to another .",
    "the third scaling relationship states that the mass surface density of molecular clouds is constant . to evaluate this relationship with the survey clouds , the variation of co luminosity normalized to the cloud area ( or equivalently , the mean value of integrated co intensity ) with effective cloud radius is shown in figure  [ sigma ] .",
    "a similar relationship is shown from the sample of objects identified in the four targeted clouds .",
    "given the results of @xmath113.2.1 , the corresponding mass surface densities are only valid for the large ( @xmath3910 pc ) objects .",
    "there is little variation of the mean integrated intensity for small clouds ( @xmath7810 pc ) which also corresponds to the population of non self gravitating clouds .",
    "this is in part due to the method to identify clouds at a given threshold of antenna temperature and that most of the luminosity arises from the extended , lines of sight with small antenna temperatures . for these small clouds ,",
    "effectively measures the projected area . for clouds with effective radii greater than 10 pc ,",
    "there is weak trend for larger mean intensities with increasing size .",
    "the mass surface density of objects is determined from the  observations of the four targeted clouds as shown in figure  [ sigma ] .",
    "the mean surface density is 9 m@xmath108 pc@xmath109 although the scatter is large for a given size .",
    "it is interesting to note that despite the uniformity of mean  intensity between clouds or clumps , the mean column density of clumps within a cloud can vary widely .",
    "thus , the mass surface density is not a constant of molecular clouds .",
    "the preceding sections demonstrate the non self gravitating state of molecular regions as defined by emission with masses less than 10@xmath5  while clouds with masses greater than 10@xmath3   are self gravitating .",
    "the limited accuracy of @xmath51 precludes a definitive evaluation of the equilibrium state for regions with masses between 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath3   for which @xmath110 . due to the high opacity of the co j=1 - 0 transition ,",
    "co observations are not sensitive to the full range of molecular gas column densities known to be present in clouds .",
    "therefore , this result does not preclude the presence of small , self gravitating regions with densities greater than 10@xmath3  in which star formation may occur .",
    "indeed , star formation is present within many of the small clouds of the w3/4/5 cloud complex ( carpenter , heyer , & snell 2000 ) . given the luminosity function in figure  [ lco - function ] , the small cloud and clump populations do not account for a significant fraction of the molecular mass in the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , these molecular regions provide insight to the dynamical state of the interstellar medium .",
    "the identified objects are strictly regions where co is detected but the dominant molecular constituent , , could extend beyond these boundaries .",
    "moreover , these regions are embedded within a larger , atomic medium such that the boundaries represent a change in gas phase rather than sharp volume or column density variations .    regions with large values of @xmath51 are either short lived or are bound by external pressure and long lived with respect to the dynamical time scales .",
    "these observations can not distinguish whether a given region is bound by external pressure as this requires an examination of the thermal and dynamical state of the surrounding medium . in the absence of sufficient external pressure",
    ", these regions expand until the internal pressure is balanced by that of the external medium . in this larger configuration",
    ", the molecular gas may dissociate due to less effective self - shielding .",
    "effectively , the co emitting regions would be rapidly dispersed over a dynamical time along the minimum cloud dimension ( @xmath111 ) , or 5 - 50@xmath610@xmath3 years .",
    "numerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the dense interstellar medium show localized , density enhancements that would rapidly lose identity due to shear , merging with nearby clouds , or expansion into the larger medium ( ballesteros - paredes , vazquez , & scalo 1999 ) .",
    "these numerical studies would suggest that the overpressured objects identified in our survey are transient features .",
    "however , there is indirect evidence to suggest that the internal motions of these regions are bound by some confining agent .",
    "the age of any molecular object is constrained by the time required to chemically evolve diffuse , atomic material to nominal abundances to enable a co observation . for densities of 10@xmath9 ,",
    "this time scale is greater than 10@xmath112 years ( jura 1975 ) which is longer than the dynamical time for these objects .",
    "unless these overpressured molecular clouds are formed within high density regions , there is simply insufficient time to chemically evolve material to reasonable abundance values .",
    "secondly , while the lower envelope of points in figure  [ alphag ] may be defined by selection effects , the upper envelope of values of @xmath51 systematically varies through 3 decades of cloud mass ( see figure  [ alphag ] ) . for transient , unbound objects",
    ", one would expect @xmath63 and independent of mass such that the observed correlation is unlikely .",
    "bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) evaluate @xmath51 in terms of the bonner - ebert mass , @xmath113 where @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the external pressure .",
    "the relationship between @xmath51 and = @xmath57 identified in figure  [ alphag ] is shallower than that predicted assuming a constant bonner - ebert mass within a given complex as considered by bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) although this is in part , due to a selection effect which excludes regions with small velocity dispersions .",
    "this may also be due to the spatial variation of pressure throughout the outer galaxy and the underestimate of the gravitational parameter for lower mass objects ( see @xmath112.4 and @xmath113.3 ) .",
    "the index is similar to values derived from  observations of targeted cloud complexes .",
    "the results of dobashi et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , yonekura et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and kawamura et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) show even shallower slopes ( 0.2 - 0.3 ) .",
    "the preceding sections demonstrate that there are a large number of molecular regions whose internal motions are not bound by self gravity .",
    "to remain bound in the observed configuration , these motions must be confined by the pressure of the external medium . to gauge the magnitude of the required external pressures ,",
    "the full virial theorem is rewritten , @xmath117 where  is the measured minor axis length , @xmath116 is the external pressure , and @xmath118 is the mean molecular column density over the surface of the object .",
    "this expression assumes that the clouds are prolate .",
    "figure  [ pext ] shows the quantity , @xmath119 plotted as a function of @xmath118 for each identified object .",
    "also shown are the variations of @xmath119 with column density for different values of the external pressure for bound objects .",
    "self gravitating objects lie along the curve p / k=0 .",
    "the primary cluster of points lie well off this line .",
    "the distribution of required pressure is shown in figure  [ pextdistr ] .",
    "the mean and median of the distribution are 1.4@xmath610@xmath3 and 6700 @xmath120 respectively .",
    "no significant variation of the required pressure with galactocentric radius can be determined given the limited dynamic range of @xmath121 and the small number of identified objects at @xmath122 14 kpc .      given the magnitude of measured line widths , the internal pressure arises from the non thermal , turbulent motions of the gas .",
    "the required pressures to bind these motions are larger than the measured thermal pressures of the interstellar medium although thermal pressure fluctuations of the required magnitude are observed within a small fraction of the atomic gas volume ( jenkins , jura , & lowenstein 1983 ; wannier et  al .",
    "however , even in the case of comparable external thermal pressure , the cloud boundary can not be maintained due the anisotropy of internal , turbulent gas flow .",
    "an initial perturbation of the cloud boundary by a turbulent fluctuation generates an imbalance of the pressure force perpendicular to the surface which in turn , causes a larger distortion of the boundary ( vishniac 1983 ) . if the molecular clouds are simply high density regions resulting from converging gas streams within a larger turbulent flow , as suggested by numerical simulations , there is an effective external ram pressure component .",
    "however , this component is similarly anisotropic and therefore , can not provide the necessary pressure to confine the entire boundary of the cloud ( ballesteros - paredes et  al .",
    "the static magnetic field applies an effective pressure , @xmath123 , to the molecular gas and may contribute to the pressure support of the cloud . for a 5@xmath124gauss field , this pressure is 7200 @xmath125 and comparable to the values required to bind the non - self - gravitating clouds observed in this study .",
    "bertoldi & mckee ( 1992 ) propose that the weight of the self - gravitating cloud complex squeezes the interclump medium to provide an effective mean pressure upon a constituent clump .",
    "the magnitude of this pressure , @xmath126 , is equivalent to the gravitational energy density of the cloud complex , @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the mass and radius of the cloud complex respectively .",
    "they demonstrate that the magnitude of this pressure is similar to the required pressure to bind the clumps within the four targeted cloud complexes which they analyzed .",
    "if the weight of the molecular complex is a significant component to the equilibrium of clumps , then the required pressure should vary with location of the clump within the gravitational potential . in this study ,",
    "the identified objects are not grouped into cloud complexes and therefore , the self gravity of the larger complex is not evaluated .",
    "in the outer galaxy , the surface density of atomic gas is much larger than that of the molecular material and therefore , provides an additional component to the weight upon a given clump or isolated cloud .",
    "the mean effective external pressure at the molecular gas boundary , due to the overlying atomic gas layer is @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the kinematic pressure at the external atomic gas boundary , and @xmath132 is the mass surface density of the atomic gas across the disk ( elmegreen 1989 ) . the kinematic pressure at the atomic gas boundary is estimated from the respective surface density and velocity dispersion of gas and stars to be 8000 @xmath7 k ( elmegreen 1989 ) . to self shield the molecular gas , the column density of atomic gas in the near vicinity of molecular material is 2@xmath610@xmath133 @xmath23 such that the @xmath134 @xmath7-k which is comparable to the magnitude of pressures shown in figure  [ pextdistr ] .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that the weight of the hi layer of gas or magnetic fields provide the external pressure to maintain equilibrium of the low mass molecular regions in the outer galaxy .",
    "a decomposition of the fcrao co survey of the outer galaxy has identified 10,156 discrete regions of molecular gas . a subset of this catalog is analyzed with @xmath135  which includes objects within the perseus arm and far outer galaxy .    1",
    ".   molecular regions with masses less than 10@xmath5  are not self gravitational . for these regions ,  masses derived from a co to  conversion factor",
    "are upper limits .",
    "2 .   the pressures required to bind the internal motions of these non self gravitating regions are 1 - 2@xmath610@xmath3 @xmath7-k . the weight of the atomic gas layer in the disk may provide this necessary pressure to maintain the equilibrium of these clouds .",
    "3 .   the  luminosity function , @xmath68 , varies as a power law , @xmath136 however , given the non self gravitating state of low luminosity clouds , this relationship should not be used to infer a mass spectrum of molecular clouds .",
