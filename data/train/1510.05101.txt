    "because hydrogen is much more abundant than any other element in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , hydrides are the first molecules to form .",
    "they therefore constitute significant reservoirs of heavy elements , as well as sensitive tests of interstellar chemistry networks and of the ambient physical conditions .",
    "hydrides are also employed to trace specific aspects of interstellar environments .",
    "for example , in diffuse interstellar clouds , hydroxyl and water cations , oh@xmath0 and h@xmath4o@xmath0 , are useful probes of the cosmic ray ionization rate @xcite , which controls the abundance of several interstellar molecules .",
    "hydrogen fluoride , hf , is formed by the direct reaction of h@xmath4 with f and can be employed as a proxy for molecular hydrogen , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the methylidyne and mercapto cations , ch@xmath0 and sh@xmath0 , are good tracers of warm regions , heated by shocks or the dissipation of turbulence , where endothermic reactions can occur , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the argonium cation , arh@xmath0 , was the first noble gas molecular ion detected in space @xcite and it has been shown to be a tracer of almost purely atomic gas in the diffuse ism @xcite . as discussed by @xcite , molecular ions , such as arh@xmath0 , are also important constituents of cold terrestrial plasmas .    in diffuse clouds , hydrides can be observed through optical / ultraviolet absorption lines superposed on the spectra of background stars . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "rotational transitions of hydrides can be observed in both absorption and emission , providing a large sampling of molecular regions , e.g. @xcite .",
    "in contrast to absorption line studies , which provide simple and reliable estimates of column densities , the interpretation of emission lines is much more problematic . the density of the dominant colliders ( h , he , h@xmath4 and electrons ) is indeed often close to the critical density . in such conditions , deviations from local - thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte )",
    "are expected and detailed radiative transfer modeling is necessary to derive both the physical conditions ( density and temperature ) and the column densities .",
    "radiative transfer calculations in turn require a good knowledge of rate coefficients for collisional excitation . despite recent experimental progress ,",
    "these coefficients are difficult to measure and theory is needed to provide comprehensive sets of collisional data .",
    "significant progress was made in recent years in computing collisional rates for interstellar molecules , see @xcite for a review on collisions with h , he and h@xmath4 . in regions where the electron fraction , @xmath5 , is larger than @xmath6 , electron - impact excitation can compete or even dominate over the neutrals ( h , he and h@xmath4 ) .",
    "for example , in the photon - dominated region ( pdr ) associated with the orion bar , @xcite have shown that the excitation of hf is driven by electron collisions with densities @xmath7  @xmath3 .",
    "a similar result was obtained recently for oh@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "electron - impact excitation of diatomic hydride cations thus appears as a crucial process in the ionized regions of the molecular ism .    to date",
    ", five diatomic hydride cations have been detected in the ism : ch@xmath0 @xcite , oh@xmath0 @xcite , sh@xmath0 @xcite , hcl@xmath0 @xcite and very recently arh@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "thus far searches for heh@xmath0 have not been successful @xcite , except for a tentative detection in the remnant of supernova 1987a @xcite .",
    "we note that heh@xmath0 is thought to be the first molecular species to appear in the universe @xcite .    at interstellar medium temperatures ,",
    "the process of electron impact rotational excitation of hydrides should have a clearly observable effect .",
    "however , the process of dissociative recombnation competes with excitation ; results presented later in this work show that the cross section for the rotational excitation of ch@xmath0 in the dominant channel @xmath8 to @xmath9 is 10 to 100 times higher than the summed experimental dissociative recombination cross section of ch@xmath0 at the same temperature @xcite .",
    "the cross section for rotational excitation for the same channel of heh@xmath0 is also found to be similarly greater than the summed theoretical dissociative recombination cross sections computed by @xcite , albeit not at resonance regions in the dissiciative recombination cross section which nonetheless never exceeded the magnitude of the rotational excitation cross section .    in this work",
    ", electron - impact rotational - excitation rate coefficients are calculated for heh@xmath0 , ch@xmath0 and arh@xmath0 , which all have a ground electronic state of symmetry @xmath10 .",
    "the * r*-matrix method is combined with the adiabatic - nuclei - rotation ( anr ) approximation to obtain rotational cross sections at electron energies below 5  ev .",
    "it should be noted that previous * r*-matrix studies on heh@xmath0 @xcite and ch@xmath0 @xcite were carried out but , particularly for the ch@xmath0 problem , the accuracy was compromised by the use of reduced treatments of polarisation and a small close - coupling expansions . in both cases",
    "the use of an improper threshold correction made the results less accurate at low electron temperatures .",
    "these limitations are overcome in the present work , as detailed below . in section  2 , the * r*-matrix calculations are described and the procedure used to derive the cross - sections is briefly introduced . in section 3 ,",
    "we present and discuss the calculated rate coefficients . a model for the excitation of arh@xmath0 in the crab nebula",
    "is also presented in section  4 .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  5 .",
    "in this paper we present results for the electron collision calculations with molecular ions arh@xmath0 , heh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0 .",
    "these calculations employ the polyatomic * r*-matrix method and are adapted to calculate the rotational excitation cross sections for specific transitions of the angular momentum quantum number , @xmath11 , of the molecules .",
    "the * r*-matrix method is a sophisticated way of performing electron scattering calculations . for a full derivation of the * r*-matrix method and its application in electron scattering see @xcite .",
    "here we used the quantemol - n expert system @xcite to run the uk molecular * r*-matrix codes ( ukrmol ) @xcite .",
    "the calculations for all three molecules used * r*-matrix radii of 13  a@xmath12 and gaussian type orbitals ( gtos ) to represent both the target and the continuum .",
    "continuum orbitals up to g - wave ( @xmath13 ) were explicitly included in the calculations .",
    "the initial calculations for molecules were carried out using c@xmath14 symmetry . in order to calculate the rotational excitation cross sections of the molecules",
    ", however , the * t*-matrices were tranformed into the c@xmath15 point group , the natural point group of the diatomic molecules .",
    "the transformed * t*-matrices formed the input to electron - impact rotational excitation code ` rotions ` @xcite .",
    "the technical details of the calculations are described below .",
    "the arh@xmath0 target was represented using an augmented aug - cc - pvtz gto basis set .",
    "the use of augmented basis sets improves the treatment of the more diffuse orbitals of the excited states in the calculation .",
    "the quantum chemistry program ` molpro ` @xcite was used to do initial hartree - fock calculations on the arh@xmath0 ground state using an aug - cc - pvtz basis set .",
    "these ground state orbitals were then used in the * r*-matrix calculation .",
    "the target was represented using complete active space configuration interaction ( cas - ci ) treatment involving freezing 10 electrons in 1@xmath16 2@xmath16 3@xmath16 1@xmath17 orbitals and distributing the remaining 8 electrons in the orbitals : [ 4@xmath18 5@xmath18 2@xmath19 6@xmath18 7@xmath18 8@xmath18 3@xmath19 9@xmath18]@xmath21 .",
    "five states per symmetry generated from the initial cas - ci calculation were used in the final close - coupling calculation with an excitation energy cut off of 30  ev .",
    "this helps to converge the polarisation effects introduced by the coupling to excited states of the molecule .    in the earth",
    "s atmosphere the isotope of argon in overwhelming abundance is ^40^ar ( exact mass 39.96238 u ) as this isotope is created by the decay of ^40^k .",
    "however astronomically the major isotope of argon is ^36^ar ( exact mass 35.96755 u ) .",
    "a third stable isotope of argon is know to exist in nature , ^38^ar ( exact mass 37.9627 u ) .",
    "^38^ar is the least abundant natural isotope and is not significant terrestrially or astronomically .",
    "the dipole moment is important when calculating rotational excitation cross sections and , for ionic molecules , the dipole moment depends upon the molecular centre - of - mass .",
    "this means that the dipole differs between isotopologues .",
    "our calculated dipole moment for ^36^arh@xmath0 is @xmath22 = 2.1425 d , for ^38^arh@xmath0 @xmath22 = 2.1517 d and for ^40^arh@xmath0 @xmath22 = 2.1595 d , with rotational constant @xmath23  cm^-1^ for all three .",
    "the best available theoretical value for ^40^arh@xmath0 at its equilibrium geometry is @xmath22 = 2.177 d @xcite . by applying the same ratio to this latter value",
    "as was found with our calculations , our best estimates are @xmath22 = 2.169 d for ^38^arh@xmath0 and @xmath22 = 2.160 d for ^36^arh@xmath0 .",
    "the experimental value for the rotational constant of ^36^arh@xmath0 , from the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ) , is @xmath24 = 10.30 cm^-1^ @xcite and this is taken to be the value for ^38^arh@xmath0 and ^40^arh@xmath0 also .",
    "we note that the rotational constants for the three isotopologues actually differ by @xmath25 but this effect , as well as corrections due to centrifugal distorsion , can be ignored in our treatment as they only influence the threshold correction we employ ( see below ) and this assumption itself introduces much larger uncertainties at low temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "the small change in dipole values was taken into accound since the coulomb - born correction scales with the square of the dipole .",
    "the heh@xmath0 target was represented using a cc - pvtz gto basis set .",
    "augmented basis sets gave result which showed artificial structure as function of electron collision energy .",
    "this is a signature of problems with linear dependence and probably caused by an excessive overlap between the augmented functions and the molecule continuum functions .",
    "the ground state electron occupation of heh@xmath0 is 1@xmath16 . as heh@xmath0 is a two electron system",
    "both its target wavefunction and the scattering wavefunction were represented with a full ci treatment , _",
    "i.e. _ by allowing the electrons to freely occupy all orbitals .",
    "all generated states up to 42  ev were retained in the final close - coupling calculation .",
    "our calculated heh^+^ equilibrium geometry dipole moment and rotational constant are @xmath22 = 1.7168 d and @xmath24 = 35.241 cm^-1^. the best available theoretical value for the dipole is @xmath22 = 1.664 d @xcite while the cdms rotational constant is @xmath24 = 33.559 cm^-1^ @xcite .",
    "the previous study on ch@xmath0 by @xcite was performed using scattering wavefunctions computed using the older linear molecular r - matrix code @xcite which employs slater type orbitals , and a rather crude representation of the lowest 6 target states in a close - coupling expansion .",
    "numerical and computational meant that only rather simple calculations could be performed which failed to give a full treatment of polarisation effects . as demonstrated by a recent study of bound and continuum states of n@xmath4 @xcite , the ukrmol code and gto basis functions employed here are capable of giving a fully converged treament of the problem .",
    "furthermore modern computers make the use of extensive close - coupling expansions straightforward ; such expansions are important for reprsenting polarisation effects @xcite .",
    "the ch@xmath0 target was represented using a cc - pvtz gto basis set .",
    "again , augmented basis sets did not give smooth results .",
    "the ground state of ch@xmath0 has the configuration [ 1@xmath18 2@xmath18 3@xmath18]@xmath26 .",
    "the target was represented using cas - ci treatment freezing the lowest energy 2@xmath16 orbital and placing the highest 4 electrons in orbitals [ 2@xmath18 3@xmath18 1@xmath19 4@xmath18 5@xmath18 2@xmath19]@xmath28 .",
    "51 excited states used with an excitation energy cut off of 25  ev .",
    "two isotopes of ch^+^ are considered in this paper : ^12^ch@xmath0 and ^13^ch@xmath0 the calculated equilibrium geometry dipole moment and rotational constant of ^12^ch@xmath0 and ^13^ch@xmath0 are the same to five significant figures and are @xmath22 = 1.6711 d and @xmath24 = 14.454 cm^-1^ respecively .",
    "the best available experimental value for the ^12^ch@xmath0 dipole is @xmath22 = 1.683 d @xcite which was used to calculated rotational excitation cross sections for ^12^ch@xmath0 and ^13^ch@xmath0 .",
    "the cdms rotational constant for @xmath29ch@xmath0 @xmath24 = 13.931 cm^-1^@xcite was used for both @xmath29ch@xmath0 and @xmath30ch@xmath0 .",
    "each of the above calculations produces four fixed - nuclei * t*-matrices for each molecule ( one for each irreducible representation in c@xmath31 symmetry ) for electron collision energy considered .",
    "these * t*-matrices are used to calculate the rotational excitation cross sections for the molecules using program ` rotions ` @xcite .",
    "` rotions ` computes the rotational excitation cross sections for each transition of the rotational angular momentum quantum number @xmath11 .",
    "it is also useful to look at the cross sections in terms of @xmath32 , the change in the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "@xmath33 transitions are strongly influenced by the long - range effect of the dipole moment and ` rotions ` employs the coulomb - born approximation to include the contributions of higher partial waves ( @xmath34 ) to the cross sections .",
    "these long - range effects have been demonstrated to be unimportant for other transitions @xcite .",
    "the best available value of the dipole moment was used in these calculations .",
    "the adiabatic nuclear rotation ( anr ) method was employed to calculate the cross sections .",
    "the anr approximation is valid when the electron collision time is less than the period of rotational motion .",
    "the suitability of the anr method to diatomic , molecular ions is explained in @xcite . as explained by @xcite",
    "the anr method becomes invalid close to a rotational threshold because it neglects the rotational hamiltonian .",
    "a kinetic scaling method , scaling with a kinematic momentum ratio solves this problem for neutral molecules but not , however , for ions , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this kinetic - scaling method has been employed in the previous * r*-matrix studies on heh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0 and the cross sections published in these studies can be said , therefore , to be erroneous in the vicinity of the rotational threshold . for this publication the threshold energy for rotational excitation cross sections was calculated from the experimental rotational constant of the molecule and cross sections below this threshold were simply set to zero .",
    "this form of threshold `` correction '' is in accord with the wigner law and has been shown to be much more accurate @xcite than the more complicated kinetic - scaling employed in the previous * r*-matrix studies on heh@xmath0 and ch@xmath0 .",
    "note that closed - channel effects are neglected but these are expected to be small for polar ions @xcite .",
    "this methodology was shown to work well in the only available experimental test of electron impact rotational ( de-)excitation rates @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "we have considered rotational transitions between levels with @xmath35 .",
    "transitions were however restricted to @xmath36 owing to the limited number of partial waves in the * t*-matrices ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "excitation cross sections were computed for collision energies @xmath38 in the range 0.01 - 5  ev . for transitions with a rotational threshold below 0.01 ev ,",
    "cross sections were extrapolated down to the threshold using a @xmath39 ( wigner s ) law , as recommended by @xcite .",
    "assuming that the electron velocity distribution is maxwellian , rate coefficients for excitation transitions were obtained for temperatures in the range 1  3000  k. going to higher temperatures would require the inclusion of @xmath40 transitions for the results to converge .",
    "furthermore the energy range 1  3000  k is considered complete for the interstellar medium . de - excitation rate coefficients were obtained using the detailed balance relation .",
    "the supplementary data associated with this paper includes rotational excitation and de - excitation rate coefficients for heh@xmath0 , the two isotopes of ch@xmath0 : @xmath29ch@xmath0 and @xmath30ch@xmath0 , and the three isotopes of arh@xmath0 : @xmath41arh@xmath0 , @xmath42arh@xmath0 and @xmath43arh@xmath0 .",
    "the datasets are published for transition with starting values of j = 0 - 11 which is complete for the temperature range 0 - 3000 k with @xmath44j = 1 - 8 .",
    "we start by considering results for electron - impact rotational excitation of heh@xmath0 and @xmath29ch@xmath0 ( henceforth in this paper to be referred to simply as ch@xmath0 ) since there are previous studies on these systems against which we can compare .       from the ground state ( @xmath11=0 ) to the lowest eight excited states .",

    "however , as observed by @xcite , the @xmath45 excitation rate approaches that of @xmath33 for electron temperatures above 100  k , where it differs by only about a factor of two .",
    "this should make the heh@xmath0 @xmath46 emission line at 74.7848 @xmath22 m @xcite of similar strength to the @xmath47 line at 149.137 @xmath22 m .",
    "although both these far - infrared lines lie at wavelengths which are difficult to study from the ground , the possibility of observing two lines should significantly enhance the prospect of observing this elusive but fundamental species .",
    "figure  [ fig : hehp-1998 ] compares the rate coefficients for key electron - impact heh@xmath0 excitation transitions with the previous results of @xcite .",
    "the agreement is generally very good .",
    "this is not surprising since the electronic simplicity of the heh@xmath0 system meant that the earlier study was already based on excellent electronic wavefunctions @xcite which had already been demonstrated by detailed comparisons with experiment for the heh rydberg molecule @xcite .",
    "the largest differences between the previous study and our new results occur at low temperatures where our rate coefficients are increased .",

    "ch@xmath0 is a difficult system to construct accurate electron collision wavefunctions for , due to presence of low - lying electronically excited states @xcite .",

    "our rotational excitation cross sections for @xmath49 and @xmath50 transitions in ch@xmath0 agree quite well ( within a factor of 2 ) with those of @xcite at high temperatures where the @xmath50 cross section is greater .",
    "the agreement is however less good at low temperatures where we find the @xmath49 transition to be more important ; this change is largely due to our improved treatment of threshold effects .",
