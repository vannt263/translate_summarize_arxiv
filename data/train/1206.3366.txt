    "in the gauge - higgs unification(ghu ) models , the vector fields of gauge group @xmath4 propagate in ( 4+d)-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the gauge components in the @xmath5 compactified extra spatial dimensions behave like scalar fields below the compactification scale  @xcite . with",
    "properly chosen gauge symmetry and orbifolding boundary conditions(bc ) , an effective scalar @xmath1 doublet can emerge at the low energy and play the role of standard model(sm ) higgs .",
    "hence , we have no need of introducing a fundamental scalar . due to the higher dimensional gauge symmetry ,",
    "the @xmath5 extra scalar fields are massless .",
    "the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) in sm can be triggered by the quantum corrections with the wilson loop in the non - simple connected space@xcite .",
    "the notorious gauge hierarchy problem associated with a fundamental higgs boson can be thus alleviated .",
    "for instance , a higgs doublet could arise from a 5 dimensional(5d ) @xmath6 electroweak gauge theory on the @xmath7 orbifold@xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath8 , the quartic coupling term in the scalar potential must be generated by some symmetry breaking quantum corrections for it vanishes at tree - level as well .",
    "when @xmath9 , the quartic coupling terms in the scalar potential , which arise from the square of field strength , are gauge invariant by construction .",
    "moreover , it is possible to generate multi scalars at the low energy@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the realization of two higgs doublets model ( 2hdm ) in 6 dimensional(6d ) ghu models , bearing in mind that ( 1 ) 2hdm predicts @xmath10 after ewsb at tree - level , and ( 2 ) @xmath11 is the minimal requirement to yield two higgs ( not limited to @xmath1 doublets ) .",
    "we shall exhaust all possible simple lie groups for @xmath0 and examine the resulting quartic coupling terms of higgs potential , denoted as @xmath12 , which is now completely determined by group theory at tree - level .",
    "it is a delightful surprise to us that @xmath12 can admit only a few forms for all possible lie groups .",
    "our key finding is that , to successfully generate a 2hdm at low energy , only the root vectors of @xmath0 associated with the would - be higgs doublets and the root vector for @xmath1 form an isosceles triangle with vertex angle either of @xmath2 , or @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , @xmath12 solely depends on the vertex angle .",
    "our result is summarized in table-[tab : table2 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the quadratic terms of higgs potential , denoted as @xmath13 , are assumed to be generated by some symmetry breaking mechanism and they can not be fixed by the gauge symmetry .",
    "however , by using the physical higgs mass spectrum , one can parameterize @xmath13 phenomenologically and bypass the question of their origin . finally , it is a well known difficulty to construct a ghu model with the weak mixing @xmath14 close to @xmath15 at tree - level@xcite . in the phenomenology section ,",
    "we discuss two possible remedies , by including either the brane kinetic term ( bkt)@xcite or an extra @xmath16 factor , to address this problem and the consequent modification to the higgs mass spectrum .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt the standard convention for lie group that @xmath17=0 $ ] , @xmath18=\\vec{\\alpha}e_{\\alpha}$ ] , @xmath19=\\vec{\\alpha } \\cdot \\vec{h}$ ] , and @xmath20=n_{\\alpha,\\beta}e_{\\alpha+\\beta}$ ] . here ,",
    "@xmath21 and @xmath22 are the cartan and root generators of @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the structure constant , @xmath23 , is given by @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we take the following normalization for @xmath21 and @xmath25 : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the two extra compactified spatial coordinates , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , can be conveniently described by a complex coordinate @xmath31 and its conjugate @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , we work with @xmath33 , the associated gauge field components in @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the group generator .    by imposing the proper orbifolding bc s ,",
    "the remaining zero modes of @xmath37 , the would - be scalars , are the gauge components associated with the unbroken group generators @xmath38 while their 4d gauge components possess no zero modes .",
    "unless further state , the notation @xmath37 is recycled to collectively signify these zero modes which carry one mass dimension , @xmath39 and two would - be - higgs - doublets can be built up in the following way : @xmath40 the sm @xmath1 and @xmath41 groups must be embedded into @xmath0 . if the root vector of the would - be sm @xmath42 is denoted as @xmath43 , the corresponding generators read @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the would - be hypercharge generator @xmath46 has to be a linear combination of cartan generators and denoted as @xmath47 . since the sm group is @xmath48 ,",
    "hence @xmath49 .",
    "the sm gauge bosons correspond to the zero modes of the gauge fields associated with these generators given as , @xmath50 in @xcite , the phenomenologically viable embedding of the sm electroweak groups into @xmath0 has been studied , where the normalization of @xmath51 is fixed such that the sm higgs doublet carries hypercharge @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the root vectors @xmath43 and @xmath51 we adopt from @xcite are listed in the first two columns in table [ tab : table2 ] . from the commutators of @xmath54 , one has , @xmath55 since @xmath56 and @xmath57 transform into each other within one @xmath1 doublet , the magnitudes of the two root vectors should be the same , @xmath58 .",
    "same requirement applies to the pair of @xmath59 and @xmath60 . from eq.([eq : triangle1 ] ) , the three root vectors , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 form an isosceles triangle lying on a plane in the root space .",
    "a trivial geometrical relation follows that @xmath63 where @xmath64 is an angle between @xmath65 and @xmath62 . for a simple lie group",
    ", @xmath64 can take only three possible values : either @xmath2 , or @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the original group theory problem of embedding the 2hdm in ghu model with gauge symmetry @xmath0 is now equivalent to looking for the existence of any equilateral , right isosceles , or obtuse isosceles triangles in the root diagram of @xmath0 .",
    "once the root @xmath43 is given , one only needs to look up the corresponding dynkin diagram and find out which simple root is adjacent to @xmath43 .",
    "next , one looks for the special isosceles triangle in the 2-dimensional space spanned by the two simple roots . in table",
    "[ tab : table1 ] , we list all possible realizations of 2hdm , by employing eqs.([eq : triangle1],[b - a ] ) , in various lie groups .",
    "note that all groups , except @xmath66 and @xmath67 , have only one possible angle between the two root vectors for the would - be higgs doublets .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the higgs quadratic couplings in ghu model must be generated radiatively by some symmetry - breaking mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the resulting quadratic couplings are highly model dependent . here , we take a bottom - up approach and treat all quadratic couplings as phenomenological parameters",
    ". then the full @xmath68 invariant scalar potential of 2hdm reads , @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 gev , and @xmath72 .",
    "the masses of cp odd pseudo - scalar @xmath73 and charged higgs @xmath74 are given by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively .",
    "similar to mssm , the tree - level mass of the lightest neutral higgs has an upper bound , @xmath77 for n=1 and 4 ( n=7 ) , which may causes a phenomenological problem .",
    "however , just like in mssm , there are many heavy degrees of freedom beyond sm in the ghu model .",
    "similar to the positive @xmath78 due to the stop loops in the mssm @xcite , it is well known that the inclusion of all the radiative corrections from either the bulk fields and their kk excitations , the brane - localized fields , or the brane kinematic terms could largely enhance @xmath79 from the above tree - level prediction@xcite . however",
    ", a general discussion on this issue is still lacking .",
    "such a model - independent discussion on the radiative corrections to @xmath79 is beyond the scope of the present paper , here we just assume that a careful consideration which includes the radiative corrections to @xmath12 can rescue the lightest neutral higgs mass problem as in mssm .",
    "the investigation along this line will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , we address the weak mixing angle problem in ghu which is independent of @xmath5 . adding the bkt to ghu model is one of the remedies to obtain a realistic @xmath14 close to experimental value .",
    "we use the following bkt which involves gauge zero modes on the brane only , @xmath80\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath81 represents zero mode , @xmath82 , @xmath83 are free parameters with mass dimension -2 , and @xmath84 are the group indices for sm @xmath1 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the 4d effective gauge couplings are modified : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the volume of the two extra dimensions . as a result ,",
    "the weak mixing angle becomes @xmath87 from the experimental value @xmath88",
    "@xcite , the ratio of @xmath89 can be fixed for a given @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the upper bound of the lightest neutral higgs mass gets a factor of @xmath90 enhencement and this problem can be alleviated as well .",
    "adding an additional @xmath91 gauge group is an alternative to obtain a realistic weak mixing angle in ghu model .",
    "the mixing between sm @xmath41 and @xmath91 leads to an effective @xmath92 ( with @xmath93 ) as in the previous case .",
    "the extra @xmath16 factor introduces a new electrically neutral gauge boson whose mass shall be arranged to be the order of the compactification scale .",
    "the original @xmath94 for each group without @xmath95 can be found in table [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "note that to obtain the realistic @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 require the largest @xmath99 among all the groups .    before concluding , we remark on the new scalar boson recently observed near @xmath100 gev with the diphoton excess at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "although most of its physical properties seem to be consistent with the elementary higgs boson in the sm , the diphoton excess may indicate the existence of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "as discussed , @xmath101 gev could be easily accommodated in a realistic 2hdm in the ghu models with some construction dependent extensions .",
    "we note in passing that the diphoton excess , if persist , could also be explained in this ghu framework for there are many charged heavy degrees of freedom .    in summary , we perform a general group theory analysis on the realization of 2hdm in ghu model with a 6-dimensional gauge @xmath0 symmetry , where @xmath0 is a simple lie group .",
    "we showed that a 2hdm at low energy can possibly be made if the three root vectors associated with the would - be higgs doublets and the sm @xmath1 form isosceles triangles with vertex angle either of @xmath102 or @xmath3 . the quartic coupling terms in the 4d effective 2hdm potential",
    "are completely determined by the group @xmath0 at tree - level .",
    "only a few potential forms can be admitted for all possible lie groups , as shown in table [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "moreover , which form to be admitted depends solely on the vertex angle .",
    "we observed that , among all possible lie groups , the 2hdm based on the ghu model with @xmath103 gauge symmetry has the richest structure in the higgs potential .",
    "we discuss the mass spectrum of physical higgs bosons and two possible remedies to obtain a realistic weak mixing angle in ghu models as well .",
    "finally , we briefly comment how to accommodate the recent observed @xmath104 gev scalar boson at the lhc in this ghu framework .",
