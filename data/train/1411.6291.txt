    "the study of stellar systems as the globular clusters provides important clues to the galaxy formation history .",
    "each cluster is made up by a relatively simple population of stars , i.e. practically all stars were born coeval , in the same region , and from the same molecular cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in latter decades",
    "several studies prove the presence of two ( or even more ) populations of stars , setting a puzzling genesis for these objects @xcite .",
    "globular clusters are among the oldest objects in the galaxy , and their ages provide basic information on the early stages of galactic formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the galactic globular cluster ngc288 is placed at ra= 00@xmath1252@xmath1345@xmath14.24 and dec.= -26@xmath1534@xmath1657@xmath17.4 ( j2000 ) , close to the south galactic pole , with galactic coordinates ( j2000 ) : _ l _ = 152.@xmath1528 and _ b _ = -89.@xmath1538 @xcite .",
    "it is located approximately 8.9kpc from the sun , in a region of small interstellar extinction , with quite low reddening [ e(b - v ) = 0.03 ] and a published distance modulus of ( m - m)@xmath18 = 14.84 [ @xcite ( 2010 edition ) ] .",
    "ngc288 is a globular cluster with a fairly low central density and is relatively metal - poor .",
    "ngc288 has a well - marked blue horizontal branch and presents the multiple - population phenomenon , exhibiting two distinct red giant branches ( rgbs ) , two populations of stars characterized by difference in light - element abundance @xcite .",
    "the possible metallicity spread is evidenced by a split red giant branch ( rgb ) , observed in color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , that may be best - fitting by isochrone stars whose second generation is @xmath19 1.5gyr younger @xcite .",
    "@xcite used multi - band hst photometry covering a wide range of wavelengths and found that ngc288 main sequence splits into two branches and that this duality is repeated along the subgiant branch ( sgb ) and the rgb , consistent with two distinct stellar populations .",
    "we report a search for variable stars in ngc288 .",
    "we obtained the ngc288 ccd photometric data with the 4.1-m soar telescope in 2013 october 28 , using the imaging goodman spectrograph @xcite .",
    "the field was centred at ra= 00@xmath1252@xmath1344@xmath14.9 and dec.= -26@xmath1534@xmath1657@xmath17.4 ( j2000 ) , approximately on the cluster centre . in imaging mode",
    "the field of view is 7.2arcmin in diameter , with 1548@xmath201548 pixels and plate scale of 0.30arcsec@xmath21pixel@xmath22 when binned by 2@xmath202 .",
    "we obtained 300 useful images in the b - bessel filter , using exposure times of 60s , with a total of @xmath197hours of observation . to construct the cmd , we obtained images with exposure times of 1 , 10 , 120 and 300s for the v and b filters , and 300 and 600s for the u filter .",
    "data reduction were carried out with iraf .",
    "we used tasks of the iraf _ daophot _ package for crowded - field stellar photometry @xcite : daofind to find stars in each image , phot to compute sky values and initial magnitudes for the found stars and allstar to group and fit point spread function ( psf ) to all stars simultaneously .",
    "the psf best - fitting was obtained with a elliptical moffat function with @xmath23 .    in total , were generated light curves for 11389 sources inside the field and with b magnitude down to 24 .",
    "differential photometry was performed , computed by taking the difference between the instrumental magnitudes of an unknown star and of a known standard star with constant brightness ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) inside the same field , to determine how the stellar brightness changes in time .",
    "the cmds for ngc288 from the 4.1-m soar telescope with u , b , v and r filters are shown in fig .",
    "[ cmdmart ] . for the cmd with v magnitude and ( b - v ) color , we made a correction using the differential - reddening ( dr ) map in fig .",
    "[ n288_hr_drmap ] , built according to @xcite .",
    "this map is based on colour shifts among stars extracted from different regions across the field of ngc288 . as a caveat",
    ", we note that stars extracted from wide - apart regions may present a difference in colour related to zero - point variations across the field , which would be taken as a difference in reddening .",
    "zero - point variation across fields may be related to inaccuracies on the psf model , sky / bias determination , or sky concentration .",
    "so , part of the differential reddening in fig .",
    "[ n288_hr_drmap ] may in fact be residual zero - point variations .",
    "we used a statistical approach to determine fundamental parameters of the globular cluster ngc288 ( age , metallicity , reddening and distance modulus ) . to proceed with this method we determine a mean ridge line ( mrl ) to the set of stars in each cmd .",
    "this fiducial line is determined as a group of points where each point represents an average of stars in cmd plane .",
    "the distance between each couple of points in fiducian line is around 0.1 magnitude ( in the cmd plane ) and is an averaged value from ten other local mean points , using small shifts to avoid local deviations ( lack or over density of stars in cmd plane ) . to avoid deviations from field stars and binaries ,",
    "we perform a sigma - clip five times .",
    "the uncertainties from this method was determined using simulations and reaches around 0.02 magitude even with a 100 per cent binaries and a 600 stars population . to fit ngc288 parameters , we compared these fiducial lines in color - magnitude diagrams ( v against b - v and v - i colours ) with grids of dartmouth stellar evolution database @xcite .    analyzing the individual fits ,",
    "the metallicity sensitivity is greatly impaired for redder colors . on the other hand",
    ", age nearly degenerates for bluer filters .",
    "the mean metallicity estimated from the cmd using this method agrees with the spectroscopic metallicity , [ fe / h ] = -1.1 @xmath10 0.1 ( without the u - b color ) .",
    "the model age of least dispersion is 13.5gyr .",
    "the reddening is [ e(b - v)]=0.05 and the distance modulus of best agreement is 14.57 @xmath10 0.08 for the v filter .",
    "this results agree with reddening [ e(b - v)=0.03 ] , distance modulus [ ( m - m)@xmath18 = 14.84 ] , metallicity [ fe / h ] = -1.32 from @xcite ( 2010 edition ) and with [ fe / h ] = -1.39 @xmath10 0.01 from @xcite .",
    "only 10 variable stars were known in ngc288 . the first variable ( v1 ) was discovered and identified by @xcite as a long - period semi - regular variable .",
    "v1 has a mean period of 103d .",
    "the second variable ( v2 ) was identified by @xcite as a rr lyra with a period of 0.679d .    found five additional short - period variable stars in the central part of the ngc288 : one rr lyra ( v3 ) and four sx phe stars ( v4-v7 )",
    ". found three more new faint variables : two sx phe stars ( v8 and v9 ) and one contact binary ( v10 ) .",
    "@xcite looked for new variables in ngc288 , using nine observation nights during 2010 - 2013 at the 2.0-m telescope of the indian astronomical observatory ( ioa ) .",
    "they did not find additional variables and concluded that the census of rr lyra stars was complete and if unknown sx phe stars did exist , their amplitudes were smaller than the detection limit for their data .    in table",
    "[ tabvaria288 ] are shown the coordinates , types and magnitudes of the ten known variables in ngc288 .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     sx phe stars are known to present a period - luminosity (",
    "p - l ) relation , which can be used as distance indicator for globular clusters @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ mag_per288 ] the period - brightness relations are indicated by the dashed lines . the brightness is given in terms of the average magnitude in the v band and the periods in days .",
    "we use @xcite who adopted the sx phe pl relation derived by @xcite in m53.using the periods of v4-v8 identified in table  [ tabvaria288b ] as fundamental periods and the five identified as harmonics in v4 and v7 [ using @xmath24 we obtain the period - brightness relation :    @xmath25    the period - brightness relations for the first three overtones are directly derived from the above equation , replacing @xmath26 with @xmath27 :    @xmath28    @xmath29    and    @xmath30    it is interesting to note what happens with v5 , v9 , v11 and v12 , all them with v magnitude very close to 17.55 .",
    "v9 , v11 and v12 present @xmath31 consistent with the period - brightness relation for first overtone , but @xmath26 displaced ( @xmath32 or more ) in relation to the predicted fundamental periods . for v5 , this happens with both periods .",
    "a possible explanation is locking by resonance between pulsation modes .",
    "the double mode of v5 and v9 was observed and discussed already by @xcite . for v9 as well as for v11 and v12",
    ", we did not detect the oscillation fundamental mode in our light curves .    using distance modulus ( m - m)@xmath33 = 14.57 @xmath10 0.08 ( see sec .",
    "3 ) , we obtain the period - luminosity relations :    @xmath34    and    @xmath35",
    "our main objective in this work was to search for new variable stars in the globular cluster ngc288 .",
    "each b - filter light curve was visually inspected according the _ e@xmath36 _ index and for those which showed significant variability we calculated the fourier transform in order to find the pulsations frequencies .",
    "the frequencies were used as input data to fit a nonlinear multiperiod function to refine the fit of frequencies and calculate the amplitudes and phases .",
    "this fit allowed us to also improve the determination of periods and frequencies of the already known variable stars .",
    "furthermore , we found two new variables stars , named here , v11 and v12 .",
    "we classify the new variable stars as sx phoenicis due to their characteristic periods and amplitude of pulsation of this type of stars .",
    "they are also located in the sx phe region in cmd .",
    "the location of the two new variables in the cmd also shows that they belong of the globular cluster ngc288 .",
    "the two new variables are in the same region of the e@xmath36 diagram as the already know sx phe v7 , v8 and v9 .",
    "this is because the five variables have small oscillation amplitudes and the same order of magnitude and therefore must share other similar physical properties .",
    "we also obtained the main parameters of the globular cluster ngc288 comparing the mean ridge line from the observed cmds using the _ dartmouth stellar evolution database _ grid of isochrones and we made a correction for the cmd with the v magnitude and ( b - v ) color using the differential - reddening map .",
    "as result , the mean metallicity is [ fe / h ] = -1.3 @xmath10 0.1 , the age model is 13.5gyr , the mean reddening is [ e(b - v ) ] = 0.02 and the distance modulus for the best agreement is 14.72 @xmath10 0.01 for the v - filter , with a distance of 8.8 @xmath10 0.1kpc .",
    "we use the period - luminosity relation for sx phe stars to determine the distance of the globular cluster using all periods obtained with our settings for eight variable stars ( known and new discoveries ) .",
    "the two p - l relations were determined , one for the fundamental mode and the other for the first - overtone .",
    "the average distance we determine by the p - l relation is 8.71 @xmath10 0.20kpc . through a weighted average of all the distances ( derived from the p - l relations and isochrones results ) we determine the best distance for the globular cluster ngc 288 as 8.8 @xmath10 0.3kpc , which is similar to that of @xcite of 8.9 @xmath10 0.3kpc , also using a sx phe p - l relation .",
    "ngc288 is a interesting case where detected sx phe stars outnumber rr lyrae . as rr lyrae ,",
    "sx phe are good for determining distances . with this work",
    ", we discovered two new variables , increasing the number of sx phe known in globular clusters .",
    "we thank the referee for important comments and suggestions .",
    "we thank the soar support team for help with the data acquisition . we acknowledge financial support from the brazilian institution capes , cnpq and fapergs / pronex .",
