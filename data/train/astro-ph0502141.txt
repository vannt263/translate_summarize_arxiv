    "recently it has been argued that astrophysical observations might favor a dark energy ( de ) component with `` supernegative '' equation - of - state ( eos ) parameter @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the pressure and @xmath2 the energy density of the i - th component of the cosmic fluid .",
    "sources sharing this property violate the null dominant energy condition ( ndec ) .",
    "otherwise , well - behaved energy sources ( positive energy density ) that violate ndec ( necessarily negative pressure ) , have eos parameter less than minus unity @xcite .",
    "ndec - violating sources are being investigated as possible dark energy ( de ) candidates and have been called as `` phantom '' components @xcite . since ndec prevents instability of the vacuum or propagation of energy outside the light cone , then",
    ", phantom models are intrinsically unstable . nevertheless , if thought of as effective field theories ( valid up to a given momentum cutoff ) , these models could be phenomenologically viable @xcite .",
    "another very strange property of phantom universes is that their entropy is negative@xcite .    to the number of unwanted properties of a phantom component with `` supernegative '' eos parameter @xmath3 , we add the fact that its energy density @xmath4 increases in an expanding universe .",
    "this property ultimately leads to a catastrophic ( future ) big rip singularity@xcite that is characterized by divergences in the scale factor @xmath5 , the hubble parameter @xmath6 and its time - derivative @xmath7@xcite .",
    "although other kinds of singularity might occur in scenarios with phantom energy , in the present paper we are interested only in the big rip kind of singularity .",
    "this singularity is at a finite amount of proper time into the future but , before it is reached , the phantom energy will rip apart all bound structures , including molecules , atoms and nuclei . to avoid this catastrophic event (",
    "also called `` cosmic doomsday '' ) , some models and/or mechanisms have been invoked . in ref.@xcite , for instance , it has been shown that this singularity in the future of the cosmic evolution might be avoided or , at least , made milder if quantum effects are taken into consideration . instead",
    ", a suitable perturbation of de sitter equation of state can also lead to classical evolution free of the big rip @xcite .",
    "gravitational back reaction effects@xcite and scalar fields with negative kinetic energy term with self interaction potentials with maxima@xcite , have also been considered .",
    "another way to avoid the unwanted big rip singularity is to allow for a suitable interaction between the phantom energy and the background ( dm ) fluid@xcite . in effect , if there is transfer of energy from the phantom component to the background fluid , it is possible to arrange the free parameters of the model , in such a way that the energy densities of both components decrease with time , thus avoiding the big rip@xcite .",
    "models with interaction between the phantom and the dm components are also appealing since the coincidence problem ( why the energy densities of dark matter and dark energy are of the same order precisely at present ? ) can be solved or , at least , smoothed out@xcite .",
    "aim of the present paper is , precisely , to study models with interaction between the phantom ( de ) and background components of the cosmological fluid but , unlike the phenomenological approach followed in other cases to specify the interaction term ( see references @xcite ) , we start with a general form of the interaction that is inspired in scalar - tensor ( st ) theories of gravity .",
    "we concentrate our investigation on solutions that are free of the coincidence problem . in this paper no specific model for the phantom energy is assumed .",
    "a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ( @xmath8 ) is considered that is filled with a mixture of two interacting fluids : the background ( mainly dm ) with a linear equation of state @xmath9 , and the phantom fluid with eos parameter @xmath3 .",
    "additionally we consider the `` ratio function '' : @xmath10 between the energy densities of both fluids .",
    "it is , in fact , no more than a useful parametrization .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 can be written as function of the scale factor .    the paper has been organized in the following way : in section 2 we develop a general formalism that is adequate to study the kind of coupling between phantom energy and the background fluid ( inspired in st theories as said ) we want to investigate",
    ". models of references @xcite can be treated as particular cases . the way one can escape one of the most undesirable features of any de model : the coincidence problem ,",
    "is discussed in section 3 for the case of interest , where the de is modelled by a phantom fluid . in this section",
    "it is also briefly discussed under which conditions the big rip singularity might be avoided . with the help of the formalism developed before , in section 4",
    ", particular models with interaction between the components of the mixture are investigated where the coincidence problem is solved .",
    "the cases with constant and dynamical eos parameter are studied separately .",
    "it is found that , in all cases , there is a wide range in parameter space , where the solutions are free of the big rip singularity also .",
    "it is argued that observational data seems to favor phantom models without big rip singularity .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by a physical argument related to the possibility that the interaction term is always bounded .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "since there is exchange of energy between the phantom and the background fluids , the energy is not conserved separately for each component .",
    "instead , the continuity equation for each fluid shows a source ( interaction ) term : @xmath12 @xmath13 where the dot accounts for derivative with respect to the cosmic time and @xmath14 is the interaction term . note that the total energy density @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is indeed conserved : @xmath17 . to specify the general form of the interaction term",
    ", we look at a scalar - tensor theory of gravity where the matter degrees of freedom and the scalar field are coupled in the action through the scalar - tensor metric @xmath18@xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the coupling function , @xmath21 is the matter lagrangian and @xmath22 is the collective name for the matter degrees of freedom .",
    "it can be shown that , in terms of the coupling function @xmath23 , the interaction term @xmath14 in equations ( [ backconteq ] ) and ( [ phconteq ] ) , can be written in the following form : @xmath24 , \\label{interactionterm}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the following `` reduced '' notation : @xmath25 and it has been assumed that the coupling can be written as a function of the scale factor @xmath26 .",
    "this is the general form of the interaction we consider in the present paper .",
    "comparing this with other interaction terms in the bibliography , one can obtain the functional form of the coupling function @xmath27 in each case . in ref.@xcite , for instance , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 denotes the transfer strength .",
    "if one compares this expression with ( [ interactionterm ] ) one obtains the following coupling function : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an arbitrary integration constant . if @xmath32 and @xmath33 , then @xmath34 .",
    "another example is the interaction term in ref .",

    "therefore , by the knowledge of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , one can describe the dynamics of the model under study .",

    "in this section we discuss the way in which one of the most undesirable features of any de model ( including the phantom ) can be avoided or evaded . for completeness",
    "we briefly discuss also the conditions under which the doomsday event can be evaded .",
    "it is interesting to discuss , in the general case , under which conditions the coincidence problem might be avoided in models with interaction among the components in the mixture . in this sense one",
    "expects that a regime with simultaneous non zero values of the density parameters of the interacting components is a critical point of the corresponding dynamical system , so the system lives in this state for a sufficiently long period of time and , hence , the coincidence does not arises .    in the present case where we have a two - component fluid : dm plus de , one should look for models where the dimensionless energy density of the background ( dm ) and of the de are simultaneously non vanishing during a ( cosmologically ) long period of time . otherwise , we are interested in ratio functions @xmath67 that approach a constant value @xmath68 at late times",
    ". a precedent of this idea but for a phenomenologically chosen interaction term can be found , for instance , in ref.@xcite , where a scalar field model of phantom energy has been explored ( a self - interacting scalar field with negative kinetic energy term @xmath69 ) . in this case , as already noted , the interaction term is of the form @xmath28 .",

    "as already noted , the necessary requirement for absence of big rip is , for the chosen set of parameters , @xmath219 .",
    "it is noticeable that , since we chose @xmath220 , the de energy density diminishes as one goes back into the past ( it is a maximum at present ) . in all cases",
    "the interaction term is negative during a given period of time in the past ( see fig.[q2 ] ) , meaning that the dm transferred energy to the de component . at higher",

    "this means that , only in the case when the evolution proceeds without big rip ( @xmath123 and @xmath6 are bounded ) , the interaction between the components of the cosmic fluid does not become unphysically large at finite time into the future . besides , for the big rip free case , as the expansion proceeds into the future , the hubble parameter approaches a negligible value , meaning that the ratio @xmath222 is small .    in the model",
    "the transition from decelerated into accelerated expansion takes place at @xmath177 ( see fig .",
    "[ deceeos ] ) . at late times",
    "the deceleration parameter approaches the constant value @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , as in the case with constant eos parameter ( model a ) , the observational evidence ( as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath210 ) seems to favor solutions without big rip singularity .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in this model , the dark energy component behaved like dust ( @xmath207 ) at early times ( high @xmath146 ) , i. e. , it behaved like an `` ordinary '' fluid with attractive gravity and , just until very recently ( @xmath224 ) , it has not became a phantom fluid . at present , the universe is already in a state characterized by constant @xmath225 and @xmath226 , meaning that @xmath227 and @xmath228 are simultaneously non vanishing . as shown before , this is a critical point of the corresponding dynamical system so , probably , the universe will stay in this state for a long time and , consequently , the coincidence problem does not arise .",
    "in this paper we have investigated models with additional ( non gravitational ) interaction between the phantom component and the background .",
    "this kind of interaction is justified if the interacting components are of unknown nature , as it is the case for the dm and the de , the dominant components in the cosmic fluid . for the sake of simplicity , baryons , a non vanishing , but small component of the background ,",
    "have not been considered in the present study , however , in a more complete study these should be included also .",
    "a comment should be made in this regard : there are suggestive arguments showing that observational bounds on the `` fifth '' force do not necessarily imply decoupling of baryons from de@xcite .    unlike the phenomenological approach followed in other cases to specify the interaction term ( see references @xcite ) , we started with a general form of the interaction that is inspired in st theories of gravity ( see eqn.([interactionterm ] ) ) .",
    "we have considered no specific model for the phantom fluid . within this context ,",
    "cosmological evolutions without coincidence problem have been the target of this investigation .",
    "we have studied two different models : model a , where the de eos parameter is always a constant ( phantom de ) and model b , where we considered a dynamical de eos parameter ( the de became a phantom just recently ) . in these models there",
    "is a wide range in the parameter space where the cosmic evolution is free of the unwanted big rip singularity also .",
    "the interaction between the different components of the cosmic mixture , enables the cosmic evolution to proceed without big rip singularity . in effect , if the interaction term is chosen so that there is transfer of energy from the phantom component to the background , then it is possible to arrange the free parameters of the model to account for decreasing energy density of the phantom fluid ( as well as of the background fluid ) . a physical argument against big rip",
    "can be based on the analysis of the interaction term @xmath14 . in model b , for instance , at late time the interaction term @xmath229 .",
    "this means that , only whenever @xmath123 and @xmath6 are bounded ( no big rip ) , the interaction between the components of the cosmic fluid does not become unphysically large at finite time into the future . besides , for the big rip free case , as the expansion proceeds into the future , the hubble parameter approaches a negligible value , meaning that the ratio @xmath222 is small . from the observational perspective it seems that the evolution without doomsday event is preferred also",
    "for this purpose we have considered model - independent analysis of snia data yielding to a mean value of the present value of the deceleration parameter @xmath230@xcite .",
    "interacting models of dark energy are also useful to account for the coincidence problem . in the present study , it has been shown that , a solution with simultaneously non vanishing values @xmath227 and @xmath228 ( @xmath85 is the constant ratio of the dm to de densities ) , is a critical point of the corresponding dynamical system ( third critical point in section 3 ) .",
    "hence , if trajectories in phase space get close to this point , these trajectories will stay there during a sufficiently long period of time .",
    "this means that , once the universe is driven into the state with simultaneously non vanishing @xmath117 and @xmath55 , it will live in this state for a ( cosmologically ) long period of time until it is finally attracted into the phantom dominated phase being a stable node of the models ( second critical point in section 3 ) .",
    "this is the way the coincidence problem is solved in the present investigation .",
    "it seems that we live already in the matter - scaling regime ( third critical point ) and will live in it for long time until , finally , the phantom dominates the destiny of the cosmic evolution . in any case",
    "the evolution of the universe will proceed without the risk of any catastrophic ( doomsday ) destiny .",
    "an obvious limitation of the present study is that only two specific models ( model a and model b ) have been considered .",
    "however , we think this suffices to illustrate how interacting models can be constructed that avoid the coincidence problem and , at the same time , fit some of the observational evidence .",
    "the outcome that big rip free models are preferred by some of these observations is just a nice result .",
