    "the mechanism of negative differential thermal resistance ( ndtr ) , i.e. the counterintuitive phenomenon of decreasing heat flux for increasing temperature difference , is a fundamental problem in modern thermal transport research @xcite .",
    "ndtr plays a pivotal role in the operation of various model thermal devices , such as the thermal transistor @xcite , the thermal - memory device @xcite , the heat - current limiter @xcite and the constant heat - current source @xcite , and it also occurs in the thermal rectifier @xcite .",
    "being central to the relatively new concept of phonon computing @xcite , ndtr is reminiscent of the phenomenon of negative differential electrical resistance in the operation of the tunnel diode @xcite and of some other electrical devices @xcite , where there exists a regime of decreasing electrical current for increasing voltage . in light of the importance of ndtr in the designing of thermal devices , and also of a general interest in the experimental manipulation of heat flow ( e.g. nanotube - based thermal rectifiers @xcite , thermal cloaks @xcite ) ,",
    "there has been much interest in understanding how ndtr can be systematically generated . in particular ,",
    "studies have been carried out for various nonlinear lattices @xcite , namely the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite , the @xmath6 model @xcite and the fermi - pasta - ulam ( fpu ) model @xcite .",

    "the equations of motion are solved using the velocity verlet algorithm . with a rich variety in their nonlinear dynamics @xcite ,",
    "these models have been used as building blocks for the devices mentioned above .",
    "recent studies @xcite suggest that the existence of an observable regime of ndtr is conditional upon the presence of a nonlinear onsite potential as well as a small system size , the latter being attributed to boundary effects , for example thermal boundary resistance @xcite . for the various lattice models mentioned above",
    ", conditions for the occurrence of ndtr have so far been studied only in terms of specific system parameters , for example in terms of the onsite potential , the system size , and the spring constant , often with the additional constraint that the temperature is kept invariant at either end of an one - dimensional lattice . from the experimental point of view , however , it is not always easy to relate specific parameters of a lattice model with experimentally measurable parameters , and therefore studies of this kind might be of limited utility . on the other hand , from both the theoretical and experimental points of view , a fundamental understanding of the nature of ndtr , and a systematic method of manipulating the occurrence of ndtr , are both lacking .",
    "in this paper , a general theoretical analysis of ndtr is presented in terms of the temperature dependance of the experimentally measurable thermal conductivity , where this analysis would be useful for both experimentalists and theorists : it is shown that ndtr can be generated for _ any _ one - dimensional heat flow with a temperature - dependent thermal conductivity and that the abovementioned additional constraint is _ not _ necessary for generating ndtr .",
