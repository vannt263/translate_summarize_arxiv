    "the optical - uv emission in agn is most likely the signature of accretion on to the central massive black hole through a thin accretion disc ( ad , shields 1978 ; malkan 1983 and citations thereafter ) .",
    "malkan & sargent ( 1982 ) noted that the uv emission shows a turnover characteristic of a @xmath11k blackbody .",
    "following studies of larger samples showed this is a general trend in agn , where the sed shows a turnover from a spectral slope of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 , to @xmath15 to @xmath16 at @xmath17  ( zheng et al .",

    "the turnover at @xmath17 , which corresponds to a blackbody with @xmath1k , is in contradiction with the thin local blackbody ad models , which predict peak emission @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the black hole mass , and @xmath21 is the luminosity in eddington units .",
    "thus , @xmath22 should range over more than an order of magnitude , as broad line agn extend over the range @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is in contrast with the small range observed ( e.g. shang et al . 2005 ; davis & laor 2011 , hereafter dl11 ) .",
    "for example , some models predict a peak at @xmath25 ( e.g. hubeny et al .",
    "2001 , dl11 ) , while objects with such seds appear to be extremely rare ( e.g. done et al .",
    "2012 ) . furthermore",
    ", high @xmath26 ad models predict significant soft x - ray thermal emission , which is also not observed ( laor et al .",

    "( 2013 ) of a sample of agn reveals similar observed line ratios , again indicating similar euv seds , and an absence of the dependence of the euv emission on the predicted maximum thin ad temperature in each object .",
    "in contrast , the sed of ad around stellar mass black holes , which peak in the x - ray regime , matches observations remarkably well , in particular near the peak emission which originates from the hottest innermost ad region ( davis et al . 2005 ; 2006 ) .",
    "the match is accurate enough that it can be used to determine the black hole spin ( e.g. mcclintock et al . 2011 ) .    what prevents ad in agn from generally reaching @xmath27k ?",
    "the universality of the observed @xmath22 suggests it is a local process in the agn ad atmosphere , most likely related to an atomically driven process",

    "is this @xmath8 regulation of the hottest and most massive o stars relevant to agn ?",
    "can this mechanism explain the similar @xmath2 observed in agn ad and in o stars ?",

    "the radius of the uv emitting region in luminous agn ad is @xmath39  cm , i.e. a @xmath5 larger surface area .",

    "the value of @xmath2 in agn ad may then be set by the radius at which the thin disc solution must break down as @xmath41 .    below we explore this suggestion more quantitatively . in  2 we derive the mass loss per unit surface area in stars as a function of the atmospheric properties . in ",

    "below we derive the integrated ad wind @xmath85 based on the relation derived above for @xmath43 ( eqs . 2 & 3 ) .",
    "we find the radius @xmath86 where @xmath87 , and the thin disc solution likely terminates .",
    "we then find the local blackbody surface temperature @xmath2 at @xmath86 , i.e. the hottest temperature for the thin disc solution .",

    "thus , equation ( 5 ) can be expressed as @xmath101 we now insert equation ( 8) into equation ( 2 ) , and get an expression for the local disc @xmath43 @xmath102 which implies a sharp rise in the local mass loss towards the center .",
    "the integrated mass loss is then @xmath103 thus , @xmath104 at @xmath105 which forms the effective inner boundary of the thin disc solution .",
    "note that the wind is sharply confined towards @xmath86 , as 50% of @xmath8 is launched inside @xmath106 and 92% inside @xmath107 .",
    "the surface effective temperature of a thin ad is ( from equation 8) @xmath108 thus , the ad temperature at @xmath86 is @xmath109 assuming an accretion efficiency of 10% , the bolometric luminosity is @xmath110 , and @xmath111 in eddington luminosity units is @xmath112 .",
    "the above expression is equivalent to @xmath113 compared to the @xmath114 dependence in the ss73 solution ( from equation 13 with @xmath115 replaced by @xmath116 ) .",
    "this simplistic derivation yields that line driven winds from thin accretion discs in agn produce an inner boundary with a maximum temperature of @xmath117  k , with a weak dependence on @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "a change by a factor of @xmath120 in @xmath121 changes @xmath2 by only a factor of two .",
    "the wind truncation then explains both the observed position of the uv peak , and its uniformity , with no free parameters .",
    "below we repeat the above derivation using the above expression for @xmath76 ( equation 3 ) .",
    "we first need to derive the vertical component of gravity , @xmath36 , at the disc surface .",
    "the inner ad is supported by radiation pressure , where the source of opacity is assumed to be dominated by electron scattering .",
    "thus , @xmath36 in hydrostatic equilibrium is @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the electron scattering opacity of fully ionized gas . or , in dimensionless units @xmath124 where @xmath125  cm  s@xmath126 on the solar surface .",
    "thus , since @xmath36 is set by @xmath61 , equation ( 3 ) can be rewritten in the form @xmath127 i.e. a weaker dependence on @xmath61 , compared to the @xmath77 relation ( equation 2 ) . inserting the ad expression for @xmath61 ( equation 8) , into the above expression yields , @xmath128 and following the integration we get @xmath129",
    "we thus get a significantly weaker rise in @xmath8 with decreasing @xmath130 , compared to the one derived from the @xmath77 relation ( equation 11 ) .",
    "we now get @xmath131 note that in this case the wind is somewhat less sharply confined towards @xmath86 , compared to the @xmath77 case . here , 50% of @xmath8 is launched inside @xmath132 and 92% inside @xmath133 , compared to @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the @xmath77 case .",
    "we also get @xmath134 or @xmath135 which is steeper than the @xmath136 dependence derived for the @xmath77 solution ( equation 15 ) , but is still flatter than the ss73 dependence of @xmath137 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 here is lower than for the @xmath77 solution .",
    "the wind flux is inversely correlated with @xmath36 ( equation 3 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath36 in hydrostatic equilibrium depends linearly on the gas opacity ( equation 16 ) .",
    "the electron scattering opacity used here is the minimal opacity for ionized gas .",
    "the additional contribution from line opacity increases @xmath36 , and thus decreases @xmath43 . as a result",
    ", the disc may extend further inwards , and thus reach a higher temperature than derived above ( eqs .",
    "22 , 23 ) .",
    "the above estimates suggest that line driven winds from agn ad prevent the formation of the hot inner ad regions with @xmath138  k , which may explain the uniformity of the fuv sed of agn .",
    "however , these estimate are rather crude , as the expression used for @xmath61 ( equation 8) ignores the reduction in @xmath6 due to the wind mass loss . below we derive the ad structure , based on the mass , momentum and energy continuity equations , including a wind mass loss term .",
    "we then calculate the revised ad sed , first using the local blackbody approximation , and then using the stellar atmospheric solution code tlusty @xcite .",
    "the derivation below is for a viscous flow , described by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "we use cylindrical coordinates , @xmath139 , and assume axial symmetry ( no @xmath140 dependence ) . we further assume the @xmath46 and @xmath141 solutions are separable , which is likely valid in the thin disc approximation , and we solve for the radial dependence only .",
    "the solution below yields the radial dependence of the vertically integrated viscous torque @xmath142 , which is required in order to get a steady state solution .",
    "this quantity , together with @xmath143 - the angular velocity radial dependence , uniquely determine @xmath144 .",
    "the physical origin of @xmath142 is an open question , heuristically addressed by the @xmath66 disc model ( ss73 ) . in ionized accretion discs , it is now widely believed that angular momentum transport is provided by magnetorotational turbulence @xcite , which when averaged over time and the vertical extent of the disc , seems to be reasonably approximated by an @xmath66-disc solution @xcite .",
    "if the disc is thin , only the surface density , @xmath145 , and the vertical structure of the disc , depend on the accretion stress mechanism .",
    "the expression for @xmath144 and the derived sed , in the local blackbody approximation , are independent of the nature of the angular momentum transport mechanism . a relation for the accretion stress",
    "is required to derive a detailed model of the ad vertical structure , which can then be used to derive the local @xmath43 from first principles , as done by cak for o stars .",
    "although the @xmath66 disc model allows to solve the vertical disc structure , it is just a convenient way to parametrize our ignorance , and is far from being a first principles solution .",
    "below we circumvent this difficulty by adopting the stellar @xmath43 as described above .",
    "the time - dependent ad equations can be derived by formulating the navier - stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates with vertical averaging ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "when the disc is sufficiently thin , the radial momentum equation is to lowest order simply a balance between rotational terms and gravity , with a slow radial inflow due to the stress .",
    "the gravitational potential then determines the rotation rate @xmath143 , which is keplerian for a point source .",
    "balbus & papaploizou ( 1999 , see also blaes 2004 ) show that with appropriate averaging , stresses arising from magnetorotational turbulence yield ( to lowest order in @xmath146 ) essentially identical relations to the viscous relations when written in terms of the the vertically integrated stress @xmath147 differs from @xcite by a factor of @xmath145 . ]",
    "we now generalize these equations to include mass outflow from the disc surface .",
    "we find conservation equations for the mass : @xmath148 angular momentum : @xmath149 and energy : @xmath150 here , @xmath145 is the surface density , @xmath151 is the radial velocity , and @xmath61 is the radiative flux from one side of the disc .",
    "these are identical to eqs .",
    "( 26 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 46 ) of @xcite except for the appearance of fluxes of mass @xmath152 , angular momentum , and energy due to the outflow .",
    "the surface terms no longer vanish in the vertical integration , giving @xmath153 , corresponding to a vertical momentum flux .",
    "this mass flux carries away an angular momentum flux proportional to the specific angular momentum of the material at its launching radius .",
    "note that we have not attempted to account for an additional torque of the wind on the disc that might arise if e.g. the wind and disc are magnetically coupled . in some cases",
    ", the torque may be plausibly absorbed into @xmath147 if there is associated dissipation that can be modelled as in equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) . in general , this depends on the details of the torque mechanism ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the second term on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) accounts for possible work done by the radiation field in unbinding the outflow . since the vertical component of gravity continues to increase ( initially linearly ) , the radiation field will do work against gravity launching and accelerating any unbound material .",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath154 , which corresponds to the fraction of the gravitational binding energy transferred from the radiation to the outflow , once the outflow leaves the thin disc .",
    "hence , @xmath155 corresponds to a flow where all material removed from the thin disc reaches the local escape velocity .",
    "if @xmath154 is treated as a constant , this prescription implies that the mass launched from an annulus at radius @xmath46 is accelerated locally .",
    "of course , this is generally not correct and more sophisticated calculations and numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) show that most of the outflow is accelerated above the surface of the disc , and predominately by radiation from regions interior to its launching radius .",
    "a realistic outflow model requires a global numerical simulation , and is beyond the scope of this paper . in the following",
    ", we simply adopt equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) as a useful heuristic which aids in the discussion of global energy conservation .",
    "we offer some discussion of the global aspects of the ad and outflow in section 7 .",
    "we now focus on time steady solutions of accretion discs with keplerian rotation @xmath156 .",
    "we assume @xmath157 and adopt the standard definition of mass accretion rate @xmath158",

    "this provides some insight on the effect of a wind on the ad sed .",

    "below we consider models which parametrize the mass flux with either @xmath77 or @xmath76 . for each model",

    "we present the derived @xmath189 for the disc+wind solution , and the associated sed ( note that @xmath190 ) .",
    "we show the significantly reduced dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath26 , as expected from the simplified analytic derivation above ( eqs . 15 , 23 ) .",
    "in the absence of a wind , the inner disc radius is often assumed to correspond to the innermost stable circular orbit @xmath191 , which in turn is set by the black hole spin @xmath192 . in the absence of a wind , higher @xmath192 ad spectra",
    "are harder .",
    "below we show that since generally @xmath193 , the value of @xmath192 has no effect on the observed sed , as the innermost thin disc region is gone with the wind .",
    "we also show below that sufficiently cold discs are not affected by the wind , and the sed of objects with low enough @xmath26 values should be well fit by the standard disc solution .      in the appendix , we describe the general relativistic generalizations of eqs .",

    ". however , there is some ambiguity in the specification of @xmath199 in this case .",
    "this is problematic for models where @xmath3 becomes a substantial fraction of @xmath200 , as the integrated mass loss and its radial profile can be quite sensitive to the precise choice of @xmath199 .",
    "therefore , we focus our attention on solutions that start from @xmath195 and integrate outward .    since our model presumes that @xmath147 is generated by _",
    "local _ stresses within the disc , there is no reason to expect that @xmath147 , set by local conditions at @xmath201 , happens to have the exact value required to match on to a stationary solution with @xmath197 . in a disc with no outflow , matter should have time to diffusively adjust as it slowly spirals in , since the viscous time decreases inward .",
    "hence , it should generally follow the equilibrium solution specified by the inner torque assumption , unless an instability in the flow is present ( see e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1976 ) . however , it is less clear whether the same argument applies to the models considered here when there is significant mass outflow .",

    "thus , the observed @xmath295 vs. @xmath20 relation in dl11 does not necessarily imply an @xmath192 vs. @xmath20 relation , as @xmath295 may be set by @xmath86 , which is independent of @xmath192 .",
    "the ss73 solution was constructed with stellar - mass black hole systems in mind , which have a much hotter ad than in agn . as a result ,",
    "the dominant opacity in stellar systems is electron scattering and free - free absorption . in agn ad ,",
    "the maximum temperature drops from @xmath302 to @xmath303k , and uv line opacity becomes the dominant photospheric opacity source .",
    "this likely explains why the observed sed in binary black hole systems is well matched by simple thin ad models ( davis et al .",
    "2005 ; 2006 ) , while in agn there is generally a gross mismatch between the predicted and observed emission from the innermost part of the ad .",
    "various agn ad models did take bound - free opacity into account ( e.g. czerny & elvis 1987 ; laor & netzer 1989 ; ross et al .",
    "1992 ; storzer 1993 ; sincell & krolik 1997 ) , and also included careful calculations of the vertical structure coupled to the radiative transfer ( hubeny et al .",
    "2000 ; 2001 ) . however , none of the models included line opacity . in o stars",
    ", the line opacity inevitably leads to a wind , and it may have a similar effect in agn .",
    "winds are prevalent in agn , as indicated by the broad and blueshifted resonance line absorption observed in broad absorption line quasars ( e.g. reichard et al .",
    "the winds most likely originate from the ad , and a likely driving mechanism is radiation pressure on resonance lines , as indicated by both analytic solutions ( murray et al .",
    "1995 ) and numerical calculations ( proga et al . 2000 ) . here",
    "we find that radiation pressure driven winds may modify significantly the disc structure .",
    "applying the mass loss per unit area measured in o stars , we find that the simple thin disc solution effectively terminates at a few tens of @xmath304 .",
    "the steep dependence of the local mass loss on @xmath35 , @xmath305 ( equation 2 ) sets a cap on the maximum @xmath35 , which is well below @xmath262k .",
    "this can explain why the observed agn seds do not show a rise towards the euv , and may also explain the rather universal turnover observed at @xmath270 .",
    "the softening effect of an ad wind mass loss on the sed of agn was noted by witt et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and slone & netzer ( 2012 ) , and for cataclysmic variables by knigge ( 1999 ) .",
    "the new result here is the application of the stellar mass loss to agn ad , which yields a uv turnover similar to the one observed , with no free parameters .",
    "in contrast with slone & netzer ( 2012 ) and knigge ( 1999 ) , where general @xmath209 relations were assumed , here we find that the derived @xmath209 relation which matched the observed sed , has a negligible effect on the derived @xmath306 ( dl11 ) , as there is negligible wind at the region where the optical emission is produced .",
    "however , it is certainly correct that @xmath307 may be significantly smaller than @xmath200 , as was pointed out by dl11 and slone & netzer ( 2012 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that obscuration near , but external to the accretion disc , produces the nearly constant sed peak . obscuring material off the plane of the disc but at low radius",
    "is assumed to be provided by outflows from ( or instabilities in ) the disc .",
    "this model assumes that mass lost to obscuring clouds is not large enough to modify the intrinsic disc emission , which is instead altered by transfer through the obscuring clouds .",
    "although we have not computed the effects of reprocessing by the outflow , such reprocessing likely occurs and the effects described in @xcite may be present at some level .",
    "the cak wind solution applies for spherically symmetric systems , where both gravity and the radiation field fall off as @xmath308 . in ad",
    "there are significant differences .",
    "thin ad are rotationally supported , and in the local disc frame , close to the disc surface , gravity increases linearly with height , while the radiation field is independent of height .",
    "thus , it is not clear that the cak solution is relevant even locally close to the surface of the ad . far enough above the disc , where @xmath309 , both gravity and the radiation field become radial and fall off as @xmath308 .",
    "thus , in contrast with the stellar case , in ad both the relative strength and directions of the radiative and gravitational forces change with position .",
    "proga , stone & kallman ( 2000 ) find that as a result there is no steady state solution , in contrast with the steady state stellar wind solution .",
    "a related issue is the difference in the velocity fields in ad and in o stars .",
    "ad are expected to have keplerian velocity shear and be highly turbulent . since line driven wind models from o stars generally assume monotonically increasing velocity profiles , non - monotonic velocity distributions ( due e.g. to the turbulence ) may modify the acceleration of the outflow .",
    "modeling such effects requires fairly sophisticated radiative transfer calculations beyond the scope of this work , which to the best of our knowledge have not been considered elsewhere .",
    "in addition , the integrated sed in agn is harder than in stars , and thus the wind is subject to over - ionization once it becomes exposed to the harder euv - soft x - ray radiation , which may shut off line driving if the ionization is large enough .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. murray et al .",
    "1995 ) have generally assumed that such irradiation only becomes important after the matter has been lifted significantly above the disc surface .",
    "however , if the inner region of the disc is thick enough it may directly irradiate the disc at larger radii , increase the ionization level and reduce the force multiplier at the disc surface .",
    "such direct irradiation is not expected in the radiation dominated regions of a ss73 solution because the ad scale height is nearly constant with radius . in any case",
    ", the irradiating flux falls off a @xmath310 and likely remains a small fraction of the locally dissipated flux ( blaes 2004 ) .",
    "significant flaring of the disc or scattering of radiation by the failed wind might increase the irradiation , enhancing the ionization level at the disc surface and potentially inhibiting the outflow .",
    "for the line driven wind to be a viable explanation of the ` universal ' uv break , the outflow clearly can not be completely quenched .",
    "the local force multiplier within an unirradiated disc atmosphere is likely similar to that in an atmosphere of a star with the same @xmath35 .",
    "the force multiplier is @xmath311 ( lamers & cassinelli 1999 ) at a column of @xmath312 from the disc surface , which inevitably leads to a modification of the disc vertical structure .",
    "the ss73 solution assumes only electron scattering , leading to a thin disc with a height @xmath313 for @xmath314 .",
    "an increase in the opacity , i.e. @xmath82 , will expand the disc atmosphere vertically , and can lead to a disc thickness @xmath315 . for @xmath316",
    "the disc atmosphere becomes geometrically thick .",
    "if @xmath317 then @xmath318 , a hydrostatic solution is not possible anymore , and a wind is launched . since @xmath319 typically in thin discs , a @xmath311 should lead to a wind .",
    "however , once the wind is exposed to the central ionizing continuum , it may get significantly ionized ( depending on its density ) , leading to @xmath320 ( murray et al . 1995 , fig.9 there ) .",
    "an acceleration length of @xmath321 will bring the wind to the escape velocity , and allow it to escape , even if it gets over ionized at the coasting phase .",
    "if the outflow does not attain the escape speed before being over ionized , the gas will fall back to the disc , forming a ` failed wind ' .",
    "proga et al .",
    "( 2000 ) present a model for a uv line driven wind from an ad with @xmath322 .",
    "they find a time averaged @xmath323% , for @xmath8 measured at @xmath324 .",
    "this wind is shielded by the failed wind produced close to the inner boundary of the simulation ( at @xmath325 ) , which is over - ionized by the central x - ray source .",
    "the agn ad wind simulation of proga & kallman ( 2002 ) show a sharp rise in the local mass loss at @xmath326 ( fig.1 there ) , and thus the integrated @xmath8 lifted from the surface may reach @xmath327 closer to the center , as derived by our simplistic use of the cak solution .",
    "as noted by proga ( 2005 ) this line driving can change the vertical structure of the disc , and likely produce a `` puffed up '' disc .      in section [ results ] , we considered two sets of models which can have rather different implications for mass loss from the disc .",
    "models in which the work done in unbinding the outflow is negligible ( @xmath184 ) can nominally drive almost all of the matter out of the _",
    "thin disc_. however , the energy required to drive all this material to escape velocity can exceed the energy released by the remaining disc material which accretes to the center ( e.g. the @xmath203 models with @xmath328 , see fig.3 ) .",
    "hence , there must be a substantial failed wind in this scenario and most of the material in this failed wind must eventually accrete , although possibly not in the form of a standard , thin disc .    in the second set of models with @xmath206",
    ", we account for the energy lost by radiation in unbinding the outflow to compute @xmath61 and use this to evaluate the @xmath43 relations . in this case",
    "the mass loss is limited by the corresponding reduction in @xmath61 .",
    "the mass outflow rate can still be quite large ( @xmath329 % of @xmath194 at large radius ) , but the accreted mass is significantly larger relative to the @xmath184 models .",
    "all the energy needed to accelerate the outflow to escape velocity is accounted for and there is no need for a failed wind to form a hotter , radiatively inefficient flow .",
    "although the latter models have the appeal of being explicitly energy conserving , the numerical simulations discussed above ( e.g. proga et al . 2000 ) suggest winds may not operate in this fashion .",
    "they are predominately accelerated by the radiation from annuli interior to their launching radius , so the assumption of a constant @xmath154 is likely a poor approximation .",
    "more importantly , the winds behave ( in certain respects ) more like the @xmath184 models , in that they launch more matter from the thin disc than they accelerate to infinity and forming a `` failed wind . ''",
    "these simulations assume a constant @xmath6 ad as a boundary condition , and find outflow rates as high as 50% of this prescribed @xmath6 . in principle",
    ", even higher outflow rates could be obtained , but such models have not been considered due to the assumed lack of feedback on the boundary condition in the models used ( d. proga , private communication ) .",
    "our best guess is that a real system would behave like some combination of the above models : a significant fraction of the radiative flux will go into accelerating some fraction of the outflow that does exceed escape velocity and becomes a wind , but not all of the mass removed from the thin disc will become unbound . much of it may form a failed wind that returns to the disc or accretes through a hotter , geometrically thick flow .    the distinction between the thin disc and the outflow probably breaks down when a non - negligible fraction of the disc is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "since the calculations presented in section 5 do not account for the detailed vertical structure , the radial distributions of @xmath35 and @xmath6 in regions where @xmath330 should be interpreted with this in mind .",
    "if most of the material lifted from the disc falls back , say due to over ionization , then it must eventually all accrete to the center . in this case , observations would seem to require a hot , radiatively inefficient flow , since substantial thermal euv emission is not seen .",
    "the bulk of `` fallback '' flow must remain hotter and thicker than standard solution , cooling primarily via inverse - compton scattering and contributing significant radiation only in the x - ray band . in this scenario ,",
    "line - driving would result in a transition from a thin , radiatively efficient disc to a geometrically thick , radiatively inefficient flow .",
    "a low radiative efficiency can occur in hot flows if the optical depth is very low or very high ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the optical depth is large , the radiation is advected inwards inside a thick disc , when the radiation diffusion time - scale is longer than the infall time - scale .",
    "this effect is expected to be present in discs with @xmath331 , where the ad becomes slim , rather than thin @xcite .",
    "interestingly , all objects in dl11 with an observed radiative efficiency below 2% have measured @xmath6 which corresponds to an ad with @xmath332 for a 10% efficiency .",
    "so , advection of radiation may indeed suppress the emission from the innermost disc .",
    "however , the sed of such a high @xmath118 disc typically peaks well shortward 1000 , so it is inconsistent with the observed @xmath289  turnover .",
    "another process is responsible for the universal @xmath289  turnover .",
    "the unbound material in the inner ad must remain hot enough to avoid emitting significantly in the observable uv band .",
    "what is the expected emission from this hot inner region ?",
    "can it form the thick and hot inner structure often invoked as a source for the x - ray emission ?",
    "let us assume the x - ray emission is produced in the inner ad region through comptonization of the incident thin disc emission which comes from @xmath333 , where the thin disc resides .",
    "the compton cooling takes place only in a @xmath334 surface layer of the illuminated hot and thick configuration at @xmath335 .",
    "so , only a small fraction of the inner disc volume will cool radiatively , while the rest of the dissipated energy should be advected inwards .",
    "the estimated x - ray luminosity of this surface layer can be derived based on the thermal energy stored in this layer divided by the cooling time .",
    "the likely projected surface area of the inner hot disc is @xmath336 , where @xmath337 ( equation 12 ) , and @xmath338 is the illumination angle of the external radiation , which yields @xmath339  @xmath340 .",
    "the illuminated column density corresponds to @xmath334 .",
    "the electron temperature is @xmath341k ( from the spectral slope of @xmath291 for comptonization , rybicki & lightman 1979 , equation 7.45b ) .",
    "thus , the total thermal energy of the electrons in the illuminated layer is @xmath342  erg .",
    "the compton cooling time of electrons embedded in a blackbody at @xmath343 is @xmath344  s ( e.g. laor & behar 2008 , equation 53 ) .",
    "approximating the disc emission as a blackbody at @xmath2 ( equation 14 ) , gives a cooling rate of the illuminated layer of @xmath345 .",
    "how does it compare with the bolometric luminosity ?",
    "the expected @xmath300 from the geometrically thin ad , which extends down to @xmath86 , is @xmath346 , or @xmath347 .",
    "we thus get @xmath348 , which is close to the typical ratio observed in agn .    to summarize , the radius of the inner thick disc , the assumption it is maintained at @xmath341k by the viscous dissipation , the implied compton cooling time based on the incident radiation from the thin ad , and the thermal energy content of the cooling surface layer of the inner hot disc , happen to combine together and give a constant @xmath349 , of the order of magnitude observed .",
    "if the inner x - ray source is produced by a breakdown of the thin disc solution due to line opacity driving , while the x - ray source is significant enough to quench the disc wind , this may lead to an instability in the x - ray and euv emission , and an anticorrelation between the two bands .",
    "the inner ad may switch back and forth from a thermal euv emitting thin ad state , which develops a strong wind and turns into a thick and hot x - ray emitting configuration , which shuts off the wind , and turns back to the thin thermal euv emission state , which again develops a strong wind .",
    "with decreasing @xmath20 the disc gets hotter , the wind starts at a larger @xmath130 ( eqs.12 , 21 ) , and the radiative efficiency is expected to get lower ( see also @xmath298 , dl11 ) .",
    "this may partly explain why accreting @xmath350 systems are rare .",
    "a wind launched at a larger @xmath130 may find it easier to escape , and low @xmath20 black holes may find it harder to grow by accretion .",
    "however , at a low enough @xmath20 , @xmath86 will move out into the gas pressure dominated regime of the disc . in this regime",
    "the disc is vertically supported by the gas pressure , so an increase in radiation pressure due to @xmath82 does not necessarily lead to a significant change in the vertical structure . a values of @xmath351 close to the disc surface will most likely overcome gravity and drive a wind .",
    "however , in contrast with the uniform vertical density profile of the radiation dominated part of the disc , in the gas dominated part the density drops steeply with height , and thus the density at the sonic point , which feeds the base of the wind may be significantly lower , lowering @xmath8 .",
    "another effect which comes in with decreasing @xmath20 is that @xmath2 increases , reaching @xmath352  k for @xmath353 ( eqs .",
    "15 , 23 ) . at this temperature @xmath354",
    "likely decreases due to over - ionization of the primary atomic uv absorbers , which will also reduce @xmath8 .",
    "observations of cataclysmic variables ( cv ) which harbour ad around white dwarfs , yield winds with @xmath355 ( e.g. feldmeier et al .",
    "1999 ) , despite the fact that the cv ad peaks in the uv .",
    "however , these systems are characterized by @xmath356 , @xmath357 , and @xmath358 . plugging these values into equation ( 11 ) gives @xmath359 , which is likely an overestimate as the ad in cv is gas pressure rather than radiation pressure dominated .",
    "thus , cv ad have only weak winds , despite their peak uv emission and the associated high @xmath354 values , due to their large @xmath195 ( see equation 11 ) .    in x - ray binaries ( xrb ) systems ,",
    "the disc is much more compact , reaching @xmath29  k. therefore , the gas becomes fully ionized and line opacity is negligible .",
    "if the outer disc extends far out enough , it can reach the @xmath360 regime , this time from the other side of the opacity barrier , probably at @xmath361  k , where the line opacity starts to build up , which may also produce a wind , this time from the outer disc , rather than the inner disc .",
    "the wind is expected to move inwards in the low hard state , as the disc gets cooler , which may disrupt the thin disc formation down to the center .    for an @xmath362 black hole radiating near eddington , the inner regions of a ss73 disc reach @xmath363  k , and should emit predominantly in the soft x - rays @xcite . at this temperature",
    "the ionization may be high enough to reduce @xmath364 and allow a thin disc solution with no wind .",
    "further out the disc will be colder , and significant mass loss is likely to occur , which may strongly suppress @xmath6 which can arrive to the center .",
    "however , if a fraction of @xmath300 , which peaks at soft x - rays , is intercepted farther out in the disc , wind launching may be quenched further outside .",
    "such a scenario may explain some low mass ( @xmath365 ) narrow line seyfert 1s with large soft x - ray `` excesses '' , such as re j1034 + 396 @xcite .",
    "since the line driven wind effectively terminates the thin disc well outside @xmath191 , the value of @xmath192 does not affect the thin disc sed .",
    "thus , in contrast with xrb , we generally do not expect the agn sed to provide a useful constraint on @xmath192 .",
    "however , for a sufficiently cold disc , with a turnover at @xmath14 , the wind disappears .",
    "this may explain the remarkably good fit of a simple local bb ad model to sdss j094533.99 + 100950.1 , ( czerny et al .",
    "2011 ; laor & davis 2011 ) , which is a weak line quasar with a uv turnover at @xmath366  ( hryniewicz et al .",
    "we therefore expect that other cold ad quasars , i.e. quasars with a blue sed at @xmath367  ( which excludes dust reddening ) , and a uv turnover at @xmath14 , can also be well fit by a simple local bb ad model",
    ". one may therefore be able to constrain @xmath192 based on the sed in these quasars , as commonly done now in xrb ( e.g. li et al . 2005 ; shafee et al .",
    "2006 ; mcclintock et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "similar issues may apply to efforts to measure @xmath192 via models of the fe k@xmath66 line and ionized reflection .",
    "the numerical solutions indicate that an optically thick disc extends down to @xmath191 .",
    "however unless the disc is cold , only a small fraction of @xmath6 extends down to @xmath191 .",
    "the numerical solution ignores the material which left the thin disc , which may form a thick configuration in which the thin disc is embedded , if it exists at all",
    ". a lack of a thin cold bare disc which extends down to @xmath368 will affect the expected profile of the fluorescence fe k@xmath66 line , produced by x - ray reflection from the ad .",
    "the line may be dominated by emission outside @xmath86 , which will make the line narrower , and its profile independent of the value of @xmath192 .",
    "line emission inside @xmath86 will depend on the gas temperature , and the line profile may be modified by possible scattering effects at a thick and hot surface layer . in any case",
    ", the emission is not expected to originate from a thin bare ad , as commonly assumed , as a thin bare disc which extends down to @xmath191 is simply not observed .",
    "we do predict that the colder the disc is , the further it extends inwards , and the broader the k@xmath66 line can be .",
    "the outflow changes the radial distribution of the emitted flux in different frequency bands .",
    "in particular , the reduction of the far uv emission relative to the ss73 solution leads to an increase in the half - light radius for the optical to uv bands .",
    "this is because the rayleigh - jeans tail of the emission from the uv peaked regions of the disc contributes a non - negligible fraction to the overall sed at longer wavelengths . removing this emission or shifting it to x - ray wavelengths increases the fraction of the long wavelength emission from larger radii .",
    "this effect is interesting in light of claims based on microlensing analysis of lensed quasars that the optical to uv emission comes from radii which are factors of @xmath369 larger than expected from the standard thin disc model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the increases in the half - light radius ( which the microlensing results are claimed to measure ) that we infer are typically @xmath370 at 2000   and @xmath371 at 4000   relative to the models with no outflow , so this effect can not account for the large discrepancies that are claimed .",
    "a caveat is that we have not considered the reprocessing of the thin disc emission by the outflow . for such large mass loss rates",
    "the wind will likely be optically thick to thomson scattering in the radial direction @xcite .",
    "some fraction of this will be scattered downward and be reprocessed by the disc at larger radii .",
    "this reprocessed emission should increase the half - light radius at longer wavelengths , although a more detailed calculation is required to estimate the possible magnitude of the effect .",
    "the inwards extent of the ad can be probed through the position of the uv turnover .",
    "the @xmath77 wind relation generally predicts a turnover at @xmath372 .",
    "however there is still some residual dependence on @xmath118 and @xmath119 , possibly in the form of @xmath373 ( equation 15 ) , which should be observationally detectable .",
    "the quantity @xmath121 can be estimated based on the broad emission lines , which gives @xmath374 , where the h@xmath375 fwhm is used to derive @xmath376 .",

    "a factor of 10 increase in @xmath376 will therefore be associated with a decrease by factor of 2 in @xmath381 .",
    "this is true as long as the disc is not too cold to become windless , i.e. when @xmath376 is not too large ( @xmath382  km  s@xmath383 , e.g. laor & davis 2011 ) . in general",
    ", the detection of a correlation of @xmath381 with @xmath118 and @xmath119 can provide a hint on the specific form of @xmath43 in agn ad .",

    "2 .   in most cases",
    "the thin ad is effectively truncated at a few tens @xmath304 , well outside @xmath191 .",
    "the derived sed is thus independent of the value of @xmath191 , and is therefore independent of the value of @xmath192 .",

    "4 .   the tlusty based models with winds tend to show a spectral break at @xmath0 , due to a combination of the lyman edge and the truncation of the hot inner part of the ad due to the wind .",
    "5 .   depending on the mass loss prescription , @xmath20 , and @xmath389 of the model , the material removed from the thin disc either escapes as a wind or forms a failed wind that must accrete . in either case",

    "higher @xmath384 object should show a larger @xmath381 , i.e. a softer ionizing sed at a given @xmath20 and @xmath6 .",
    "rather detailed wind simulations are available , and it will be interesting to explore the radiation transfer through the wind / failed wind , and its possible impact on the observed sed",
    ". however , a major uncertainty in wind models remains concerning the vertical structure of the disc , in particular the top layer from which the wind is launched .",
    "the structure depends on the exact nature of the turbulence and how it is dissipated .",
    "thus , one can not yet derive estimates for @xmath393 from first principles .",
    "we went around this major uncertainty by adopting @xmath393 derived based on @xmath394 of o stars .",
    "although the models adopted here are rather simplified , they yield seds remarkably similar to those generally observed , without significant sensitivity to the details of the launching mechanism .",
    "however , the structure of the innermost disc and its possible feedback , in particular when the implied outflow becomes comparable to the accretion rate , need to be further explored .",
    "one possible feedback is x - ray irradiation of the innermost disc , which if strong enough , may ionize the surface disc layer to a level which will quench the line driven wind . if the hot inner disc is indeed formed by a line driven failed wind , then quenching the wind may quench the x - ray source , which will allow the wind to form again .    despite the associated uncertainty in the above analysis",
    ", a plausible statement one can make is that in agn , as in o stars , _ `` a static atmosphere is not possible '' _ ( cak ,  ii there ) . the true structure of the inner ad remains to be understood .",
