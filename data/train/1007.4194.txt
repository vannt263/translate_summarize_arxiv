    "most of this gas is thought to be neutral atomic hydrogen ( ) , or cold ( t @xmath10 50 k ) molecular hydrogen ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the presence of cold @xmath2  is usually inferred only by indirect means via observations of carbon monoxide ( co ) , and quantified by assuming an ( uncertain ) empirical conversion factor between the two molecules .",
    "direct detection of @xmath2  is preferable .",
    "however , since @xmath2  has no allowed dipole radiative transitions , it has to be heated above @xmath9  100  k to radiate significantly via quadrupole pure - rotational transitions in the mid - infrared ( mid - ir ) or through ro - vibrational transitions from even warmer gas emerging in the near - infrared .",
    "furthermore , the other direct observational window  the detection through the absorption of uv radiation in the electronic lyman  werner bands  is challenging , and only under rare conditions has it been possible to detect the presence of cold @xmath2  in the galaxy through fuv absorption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "unusually strong intergroup @xmath2  emission associated with a large - scale ( @xmath9  30  kpc ) x - ray emitting shock has recently been found associated with the compact stephan s quintet galaxy group @xcite and the _ taffy galaxy _ bridge ( b. w. peterson et al .",

    "other sources of @xmath2  heating , for example cosmic ray heating , have also been suggested to explain the strong @xmath2  emission in the orion bar @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine the strength of @xmath2  emission in the outer regions of nearby galaxies , where star formation and cosmic ray heating are much reduced , and where the dominant gas component is usually assumed to be neutral atomic hydrogen rather than molecular gas . by outer regions in this paper",
    "we mean the radii 10 kpc and beyond from the nucleus .",

    "this suggested a dominant contribution of molecular hydrogen to the mass - density of the disk , and perhaps that molecular hydrogen could contribute a significant part of the `` missing mass '' in this galaxy .",
    "intrigued by these early _ iso _ results , we pursued _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ? * ) observations of two local , nearly edge - on galaxies , ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 , to explore the possibility of massive reservoirs of warm molecular gas far from the nuclei .",

    "the spectral range also covered several other mid - ir lines which assisted us in exploring the importance of star formation as an excitation mechanism in these regions .",

    "for the lh spectra of ngc  4565 , we encountered a low - level `` fringing '' effect not seen in the spectra of ngc  5907 .",
    "this effect would normally have been removed had we obtained dedicated `` off '' observations ( not obtained during our cycle-1 observations ) , and appears to be the result of incomplete `` jail bar '' removal in the pipeline ( an effect in which parts of the detector array show a patterning , which in this case was brighter than usual ) . to remove this effect",
    ", we decided to use the observations taken at 15 kpc southeast ( se ) of the nucleus of ngc  4565 as a reference , and subtracted this lh spectrum from all the others .",
    "this led to a significant improvement in the spectra .",
    "nonetheless , such a procedure runs the risk that there may have been faint emission at that reference position which would be removed from all other lh points ( this primarily affects the @xmath2  00 s(0 ) line which lies in the lh module",
    ". however , unlike the 15 kpc northwest ( nw ) point , which clearly shows 28  @xmath0 m s(0 ) emission even before we performed the subtraction , the se point appears devoid of emission as can be seen in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "we feel confident , therefore , that the use of the se 15 kpc spectrum as a reference has not adversely affected our conclusions .",
    "although faint emission might have been present in this reference spectrum , based on measurements of the raw spectrum of ngc  4565 at the 15 kpc se position , we believe that an rms upper limit to such emission is 1.2 @xmath13 10@xmath15 w  m@xmath7  hz@xmath8 at the position of the 00 s(0 ) line , corresponding to less than 10@xmath16 of the faintest @xmath2  emission detected at the 15 kpc nw point . in other words , the subtraction of the reference spectrum from the observations introduces a systematic error ( not to be confused with a random error ) which is estimated to be less than 10% of the faintest emission detected , a result that does not affect the conclusions of this paper .",
    "none of the sh spectra were affected by this instrumental effect .    finally , we combined ( by averaging ) the spectra obtained at the two nod positions at each separate radial distance .",

    "it achieves a high value in the nucleus of ngc  4565 , consistent with what was seen by @xcite in the sings sample , presumably due to the higher excitation conditions near an agn .",
    "the @xmath2  s(0 ) to @xmath2  s(1 ) ratio hovers around 0.5 in both galaxies and is seen to increase towards the outer disk in both galaxies on both sides of the disk .",
    "this may primarily be an effect of the temperature , and it will be discussed in more detail in section  [ excisection ] .",
    "we also show the @xmath2  s(0 ) to [ ]  33.48  @xmath0 m ratio .",
    "[ ]  33.48  @xmath0 m is mostly excited by star formation , and thus this ratio can be used as a rough indicator of the significance of star formation induced excitation of the @xmath2  molecule .",
    "we see that the ratio stays fairly constant at around 0.5 in both galaxies , but goes up at the 15 kpc nw point in ngc  4565 .",
    "this is consistent with the ionization level of molecules dropping in the outermost disk , as discussed in section  [ excitdiscussion ] below .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the ratios of the fluxes in the 11.3 and 7.7  @xmath0 m  pah features versus the distance from the nucleus on the nw side of ngc  4565 .",
    "the irac 8  @xmath0 m  fluxes measured in the irac image within the sh aperture and at the same spatial locations as the spectra were used as a proxy for the 7.7  @xmath0 m  pah flux .",
    "the ratio is increasing towards 15 kpc nw , which most likely implies that the ism is becoming less ionized towards the outer disk , as the 7.7  @xmath0 m  pah feature consists of more ionized dust material than the 11.3  @xmath0 m  pah feature ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we constructed excitation diagrams ( figures  [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] ) from the @xmath2data in order to place constraints on the molecular gas properties .",
    "these diagrams plot the column density ( n@xmath22 ) of @xmath2  in the upper level of each transition , normalized by its statistical weight , versus the upper level energy e@xmath22 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we derived from the measured fluxes assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium for each position observed . both extended and point source flux distributions are shown for the detected lines .",
    "the extended source results include a wavelength - dependent slit - loss correction which makes the extended flux calibration differ from the point source flux calibration typically by a factor of  1.5 , and has a further geometrical correction of 4.66 for the different areas of the sh and lh slits .",
    "the grey area between the two limiting cases ( point and extended ) is the parameter space that most likely encompasses the actual case .",
    "however , we stress that the point source assumption is very unrealistic , as discussed in section  [ observ ] and given the small slit aperture and the thickness of the disks .",
    "as we will see , this assumption also leads to unlikely low gas temperatures close to 100 k , and therefore high implied @xmath2  gas surface densities . for this reason we prefer to consider the extended source limit to be much closer to the actual situation , but",
    "the point source provides a useful ( although unrealistic ) boundary .",
    "the uncertainty in the @xmath2  properties is governed largely by this uncertainty in the slit loss corrections rather than the formal errors , which are quite small because the lines were all detected with quite high signal to noise ratios ( snr ; they vary from 10 to 50 in most cases ) .",
    "the solid lines indicate the best fits to the s(0 ) , s(1 ) , and s(2 ) data points assuming @xmath2  in thermal equilibrium with a single - temperature component ( we will discuss the consequences of relaxing this assumption below ) .",
    "the fits also assume a thermal equilibrium ratio for the ortho - to - para species ( o / p ) , as is reasonable if the density of the @xmath2  is above the critical density ( which , for the low j transitions , is typically @xmath9  100 mol  @xmath23 ) , a condition probably satisfied in most cases . for temperatures less than @xmath9  300 k ,",
    "this leads to o / p ratios @xmath10 3 .",
    "for example , at t = 115120 k , o / p = 2 for thermal equilibrium . however , it is far from clear that thermal equilibrium is appropriate in all cases .",
    "for example , if the excitation mechanism were a shock , then the passage of the shock could leave the @xmath2  molecules in a state where they do not have enough time to equilibrate .",
    "this is another source of uncertainty .",
    "for example , if o / p was 3 instead of 2 ( a case where the gas has not had time to come into thermal equilibrium ) , then this would change the calculated temperature from t = 120 k to 113 k with a corresponding increase in the total @xmath2  mass surface density .",
    "this uncertainty in the o / p ratio is comparable with the uncertainty in the clumpiness in the @xmath2  distribution which leads to the broad range of possible temperatures as shown in figures  [ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] .",
    "the single - temperature fits to these data are shown in each panel of the figures . outside the nucleus",
    "only an upper limit is available for the s(2 ) line .",
    "therefore , fitting more than one thermal component is not statistically justifiable  the fits are the formal solutions .",
    "we note that the assumption that the source of @xmath2  is a point source always yields very low @xmath2  temperatures , bordering on becoming physically unreasonable . thus we believe that the warmer temperatures implied by the extended source calibration are more physically reasonable for the case of these edge - on galaxies .",
    "one exception is the nucleus of ngc  4565 , where a point - source assumption may be reasonable , as it contains a seyfert nucleus .",
    "based on these assumptions , tables  [ excipars ] and [ excipars2 ] summarize the derived @xmath2  physical parameters for ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 , respectively : temperature ( k ) , equilibrium ortho / para ratio , column density of @xmath2  ( mol cm@xmath7 ) , and the mass surface density of @xmath2  ( m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 ) .",
    "the temperatures and mass surface densities for ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 are also shown in figures  [ fig12 ] and [ fig13 ] .",
    "the gas is colder in the outer disk where the mass surface density is also lower , creating the apparent impression of a correlation between temperature and mass surface density .",
    "the derived ( extended source ) mass surface densities are more than 100 times smaller than those found in ngc  891 by @xcite .",
    "see section  [ darkmatter ] for more discussion about the implication of the implied warm @xmath2  mass surface densities .",
    "if one adopts the extended source assumption , and excludes the nucleus of ngc  4565 which is significantly warmer , there is no obvious change in the fitted temperature with radius within the uncertainty from @xmath1 = 5  kpc to @xmath1 = 10  kpc on both sides of this galaxy ( t = 146149 k on the southeastern side and t = 132134 k on the northwestern side ) .",
    "even at @xmath1 = 15  kpc on the northwestern side , the upper limit to the s(1 ) flux provides a temperature limit which is at least consistent with a flat temperature distribution .",
    "the situation is different in ngc  5907 , where the outermost 10  kpc points seem more than 10  k cooler than those measured at 5  kpc . for this galaxy",
    "the radial temperature profile is also symmetric , unlike that in ngc  4565 .",
    "in the previous discussion we have made an assumption that a single - temperature model is reasonable .",
    "this is clearly not the case for the nucleus of ngc  4565 , where the 00 s(2 ) line was detected .",
    "the first panel of figure  [ fig10 ] shows that the single - temperature fits do not pass through the s(2 ) point .",
    "indeed , in general , extragalactic sources almost always show a range of allowable temperatures and often a multiple - component fit is required .",
    "one consequence of fitting a multiple - temperature model is that the warmer component softens the slope of the fit in the excitation diagram .",
    "this means that the lower temperature component becomes even cooler , once a warm component is subtracted . to illustrate this",
    "we have fitted a two - component model to the nucleus of ngc  4565 and derived the following temperatures and column densities . instead of a single ( in this case point - like ) nuclear source with t = 122@xmath124 k and a column density n@xmath25 of 5.9  @xmath13  10@xmath26  mol  cm@xmath7 , we obtain t(1 )",
    "=  115@xmath123 k , n(1)@xmath25 = 7.4  @xmath13  10@xmath26  mol  cm@xmath7 , and t(2 ) = 450550 k , n(2)@xmath25 = 34  @xmath13  10@xmath27  mol  cm@xmath7 .",
    "the warmer component is less constrained because the error bar on the s(2 ) line is larger than that of the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines .",
    "note that the effect in this case of relaxing the single - temperature model is to increase the cold component column density by 25% .",
    "the warmer component adds a negligible amount to the final column density .",
    "it is very likely that the nucleus of ngc  4565 is different from the disk because it contains a seyfert component which may contribute additional heating to the @xmath2emission .",
    "this is reflected in the generally higher single - temperature fits shown in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "it may seem odd that the two - component fit gives a temperature for the cold component in the nuclear pointing that is colder than elsewhere in the disk .",
    "however , the thermodynamics of the @xmath2  molecule is likely to be very complex , involving a multi - phase medium with unknown heating and cooling conditions .",
    "it is also possible that the density distribution of the clouds near the nucleus is very different from elsewhere in the disk , and there may be more very dense cold clouds near the nucleus . with the spatial resolution afforded by the irs , we can not resolve this question .",
    "furthermore , magnetohydrodynamic shocks may be driven into a clumpy medium near the nucleus , which will lead to a range of temperatures .",
    "it should also be noted that it is impossible to estimate what the separate contributions of the disk and the nucleus are to the observed line fluxes in the nuclear pointings .",
    "thus , depending on the strength of a second or third component , the temperature of the coolest component is always lowered relative to a single - temperature fit - case . because we used only single - temperature fits , it is possible that we underestimated the total @xmath2  column density if warmer components were present , because a cooler @xmath2  temperature implies a larger total @xmath2  column density",
    ". since we have , in general , no information about a warmer component , we can not do more than fit a single - temperature component and accept a degree of uncertainty in the final @xmath2  column densities and masses .",
    "the line fluxes measured in the seyfert nucleus of ngc  4565 are listed in table  [ table1b ] .",
    "the continuum appears relatively flat , although it shows a signature of the broad pah emission feature around 17  @xmath0 m .",
    "since the apertures are relatively large ( covering several hundreds of pc ) , a lot of this pah emission is likely to come from the disk of ngc  4565 .",
    "the 11.3  @xmath0 m  and 12.9  @xmath0 m  pah features are also strong , but weaker than in the spectra taken at 5  kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the detected emission lines come from @xmath2 , o , ne , s , and si . the agn indicator lines of [ ]  14.32  @xmath0 m  and [ ]  24.31  @xmath0 m  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) are both detected at s / n @xmath9  10 . the @xmath2  s(0)/@xmath2  s(1 ) ratio reaches its minimum at the nuclear position ( see figure  [ fig7 ] ) , implying the highest gas temperatures , as can also be seen in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "the [ ] 15.55  @xmath0m/ [ ]  12.81  @xmath0 m  ratio reaches a peak in the nucleus .",
    "the value of @xmath9  1 for this ratio indicates a moderate nuclear starburst @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the classification of ngc  4565 as a sy1.9 galaxy @xcite .          in both galaxies ,",
    "ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 , we see that the emission line intensities and the derived mass surface densities of @xmath2  emission ( as well as the intensity of the forbidden lines ) decrease with increasing radius , while the temperature decreases only slightly .",
    "also , the 20-cm radio continuum , for ngc  4565 shown in figure  [ fig14 ] @xcite , decreases strongly towards the 15  kpc radius ( which in ngc  4565 is actually outside the detected radio continuum emission on the nw side ) .",
    "we calculated the ratio of the @xmath2  luminosity surface density over the total infrared ( tir ) emission luminosity surface density ( figure  [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "tir was calculated as in equation ( 9 ) of @xcite over the lh slit area , measuring surface brightness values in the 8 , 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath0 m  spitzer irac and mips maps that were all smoothed to the resolution of the 160 @xmath0 m  map , at the positions of the observed irs slits .",
    "this ratio is relatively constant with the radius at about 0.2%0.4% .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than the 0.05%0.1% typically seen in the sings sample , but since we could not match the resolution and aperture of the broad - band images , from which tir was estimated , to the single slit observations taken in the staring mode , such a bias is expected .    when plotting the @xmath2  emission power over the irac 8  @xmath0 m  power ( figure  [ fig16 ] ) we see that the points in ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 lie generally above the star formation region points in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we see an increase in the ratio towards the outer 15 kpc nw point in ngc  4565 .",
    "we also see no change in the @xmath2  s(0)/11.3  @xmath0 m  pah ratio ( figure  [ fig17 ] ) on the northwestern side of the disk of ngc  4565 , but we see an increase in the 11.3  @xmath0m/7.7  @xmath0 m  pah feature ratio ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) from 10  kpc to 15  kpc .",
    "one explanation is that the pahs become more neutral in the lower uv excitation environment of the outer disk at 15  kpc nw in ngc  4565 .",
    "the possible change in pah excitation from ionized to neutral changes the relative strengths of the 11.3  @xmath0 m  with respect to the 7.7  @xmath0 m  pahs because the 11.3  @xmath0 m  pah feature becomes more dominant as the pahs become more neutral .",
    "this might naturally explain why the 15  kpc nw point in figure  [ fig15 ] stands out .",
    "it is not due to the @xmath2  emission becoming relatively stronger at 15  kpc , but due to the 7.7  @xmath0 m  pah feature becoming weaker .",
    "we also measured the 24  @xmath0 m  flux densities in the areas covered by the irs slits in ngc  4565 , and noticed that the 24  @xmath0 m  flux density decreases with radius .",
    "since the 24  @xmath0 m  emission is a relatively good proxy of the star formation intensity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this implies that the uv flux intensity is decreasing with radius , therefore producing a more neutral ism at larger radii , consistent with our results derived from the pah flux ratio .",
    "@xcite have shown that there is an apparently strong coupling between the surface densities of neutral hydrogen and dark matter in spiral galaxies , with a significant and pronounced peak in @xmath28/@xmath29  @xmath9  9 . to see whether this holds in ngc  5907",
    ", we used the multicomponent dynamical model of ngc  5907 by @xcite .",
    "for ease of calculation we approximated the dark matter distribution by a singular isothermal sphere . at a radial distance of 10 kpc from the nucleus",
    "we calculate a @xmath30 = 188  m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 . @xmath31",
    "@xmath9  17.4  m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 @xcite and the ratio of the two is 10.8 . including the warm @xmath2  gas only reduces the dark matter to gas ratio to 9 .",
    "thus ngc  5907 appears to follow the relationship found by @xcite . at a radial distance of 15  kpc from the nucleus the warm @xmath2  is undetected .",
    "assuming , as suggested by the data , an extended , smooth emission distribution , @xmath32  @xmath33  3  m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 . using our approximation to the barnaby  thronson model , @xmath30/@xmath32  @xmath34  42 . at 15",
    "kpc , @xmath35 = 10.3  m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 and @xmath30/@xmath35  = 12.2 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the mass of the ism in ngc  5907 , including the mass of the warm molecular gas , is too small by more than an order of magnitude to account for the requisite dark matter .",
    "unfortunately there is no model of the mass distribution and dynamics of ngc  4565 similar to that of @xcite for ngc  5907 .",
    "the neutral atomic hydrogen properties were studied by @xcite , and the cold molecular gas properties by @xcite while visible light surface photometry of ngc  4565 was performed by @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the stars and the ism are confined to a thin disk and the dark halo can be described , again , by a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "the rotation curve is given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the optical disk is truncated at a radius of 24.9 kpc , comparable to where @xcite sees a warp . using a @xmath36-band luminosity of the old disk of 1.4@xmath1310@xmath37 l@xmath6 and a median value of 7.5 ( corrected for hubble constant h@xmath38  =  75  km  s@xmath8  mpc@xmath8 ) for the mass to luminosity ratio of sab  sb galaxies from @xcite ,",
    "the mass of the luminous stellar disk is 10.5@xmath1310@xmath37  m@xmath6 .",
    "this may be an overestimate as some fraction of the mass quoted by @xcite is dark .",
    "the total mass of the neutral atomic hydrogen is 5.96@xmath1310@xmath39  m@xmath6 @xcite and that of the cold molecular hydrogen 2.4@xmath1310@xmath39  m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the ism and the stars are confined to a thin disk and all components are truncated at 25  kpc .",
    "@xcite suggests that the velocity at the truncation radius is    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is 25 kpc for ngc  4565 and @xmath42 is the total mass .",
    "beyond @xmath41=25 kpc the velocity is assumed to decline in a keplerian fashion . at a radial distance of 35  kpc , the observed circular velocity of the galaxy is about 214 km  s@xmath8 @xcite . from the mass and velocity components of our model we find that the halo contributes a velocity of 150  km  s@xmath8 to the system .",
    "we reflect these values back to a radius of 15  kpc at which we observed the most distant emission from warm @xmath2 , and we recalculate the mass surface densities . assuming a singular isothermal sphere for the dark matter , the mass surface density of dark matter is 86  m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 , the ratio of the mass surface densities of dark matter and warm @xmath2  ( with the much likelier smoothly distributed extended source emission calibration ) is @xmath34  86/1.8 = 48 , and that of dark matter to all of the ism components ( neutral atomic hydrogen , warm molecular hydrogen , and cold molecular hydrogen ) is @xmath34 15 .    from our analysis",
    "it is clear that the mass surface densities of the warm molecular gas can not produce the observed rotation velocities at large radii in ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 .",
    "the `` missing mass '' in these two galaxies can not be accounted for by warm @xmath2  gas .",
    "the molecular gas at the 15 kpc nw point in the outer disk of ngc  4565 , as probed by the @xmath2  rotational lines , has roughly the same temperature and the same ratio of the @xmath2  to far - ir power as in the inner disk .",
    "however , the star formation rate at the 15 kpc nw point , traced by the mid - ir emission , has substantially decreased , compared to the inner disk . in other words , although the intensity of the exciting radiation field has been reduced ( as seen also in the change in the ratio of the ionized to neutral pah molecules and in a reduction in the tir intensity when comparing the 10 kpc nw and 15 kpc nw points ) , the molecular gas is heated to a similar temperature throughout the disk .",
    "therefore , something other than star formation may be heating the gas at the 15 kpc nw point .",
    "cosmic ray ( cr ) heating of the @xmath2  does not appear viable at the 15 kpc nw point because we see a dramatic decrease in the strength of the synchrotron radio continuum emission , which is a tracer of cosmic rays accelerated in the magnetic field of the galaxy , between the 10 and 15 kpc nw points , as shown in figure  [ fig14 ] .",
    "the 15 kpc nw point lies outside the detectable signal in the radio continuum maps of @xcite .",
    "the upper limit of the 20-cm radio continuum ( 150 @xmath0jy / beam ; 3@xmath19 ) at the 15 kpc nw point suggests a difference of a factor of @xmath17 64 in the 20-cm radio continuum flux density between the 10 and 15  kpc points .",
    "this change is not reflected in the decrease in the @xmath2  line luminosity which is only a factor of 7 .",
    "however , despite the lack of detected radio continuum at the 15 kpc nw point , we can not completely rule out cr excitation .",
    "if we assume an equipartition of energy between crs in the disk and the magnetic energy density , the upper limit to the radio continuum flux density corresponds to an upper limit for the equipartition magnetic field strength of @xmath44  @xmath33  1  @xmath0 g , following the assumptions discussed in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a magnetic energy density ( and a comparable cr energy density ) of @xmath9  9.6 @xmath13 10@xmath45 ergs  @xmath23 . for a canonical synchrotron lifetime in the mid - plane of 10@xmath46 yrs",
    ", the crs could potentially provide @xmath47  @xmath33 4.7  @xmath13  10@xmath48  w / kpc@xmath49 of power if such a population of crs existed below the detection limit of the radio continuum observations .",
    "interestingly , this is only a factor of two lower than the @xmath2line luminosity in the s(0 ) line at 15 kpc nw ( 7 @xmath13 10@xmath48 w / kpc@xmath49 ) , and therefore cr heating , although unlikely ( it would require very rapid deposition timescales of much less than 10@xmath46 yrs and high heating efficiency ) , can not be completely ruled out .",
    "we note that the equivalent @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the 10 kpc nw point in ngc 4565 are 3.3  @xmath0 g and 5.0  @xmath13  10@xmath52  ergs  @xmath23 , respectively  =  10  kpc and 5  kpc at @xmath1  =  15  kpc . ] , and the ratio of @xmath51/@xmath53(@xmath2 )  @xmath9  0.5 at that point .",
    "this suggests that within the radio continuum emitting disk of ngc  4565 , trapped cosmic rays can , in principle , provide energy to heat the @xmath2  in the disk ( again high heating efficiency would be needed ) . in those same regions , star formation , through pdr heating , provides a more likely channel for heating the @xmath2  gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the feasibility of cosmic ray heating at @xmath1  =  15 kpc can also be estimated using an independent ionization argument @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the cosmic rays heat the gas through partial ionization of the @xmath2  to h@xmath54@xmath55 , then the rate of ionization through cosmic ray heating must balance the rate of cooling of the @xmath2  per molecule . for a column density @xmath56 @xmath9  1.1  @xmath13",
    "10@xmath57  mol  cm@xmath7 and the observed luminosity in the s(0 ) line , we estimate the @xmath2  cooling per molecule to be 6.7  @xmath13  10@xmath58 w  mol@xmath8 . @xcite estimate the cr heating rate per molecule to be 8  @xmath13  10@xmath59  @xmath60@xmath61 w , where @xmath60@xmath61 is the @xmath2ionization rate . under these assumptions , for cr heating to balance the @xmath2  cooling would require an ionization rate of @xmath9  10@xmath62  s@xmath8 .",
    "this value is comparable to that measured in the galactic center ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is unlikely to be realized in the outer disk of ngc  4565 .",
    "this again suggests that cr excitation is an unlikely source of heating for the s(0 ) line at @xmath1 = 15 kpc unless conditions there are very unusual .",
    "the two remaining options for @xmath2  excitation in the outer disk are heating within extended pdr regions , or shock heating .",
    "we have already shown that the ratio of the @xmath2  power to the far - ir emission power is consistent with pdr heating ( in comparison with the models of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it is not clear if this process works in the outer disk .",
    "indeed , it is very likely ( and observations with the _ herschel space observatory _ will help to resolve this issue ) that a large component of the tir flux we see in the outer disk of ngc  4565 comes from cirrus clouds heated by the general radiation field of the outer disk , and not from young stars .",
    "thus one is left with the puzzling result that the @xmath2  excitation remains constant to within a factor of two in the outer disk which does not contain a high concentration of young stars .",
    "widely distributed pdr regions around a smoothly distributed set of faint young stars may be responsible for the excitation , but this can not be demonstrated with our observations .",
    "another possible way of heating the @xmath2  is by shocks , perhaps through a recent passage of a disturbance through the outer disk of ngc 4565 .",
    "a recent model of how @xmath2  can be excited in a powerful shock propagating through a multi - phase medium in stephan s quintet has been presented by @xcite . however",
    ", this model was tuned to the specific problem of how to generate large amounts of power in the @xmath2lines in a 1000  km  sec@xmath8 shock moving through a clumpy medium . to explain the emission in the outer regions of ngc  4565 via shocks would require considerably less energy input , but there is no obvious source of energy to drive the shocks .",
    "curiously , recent _ spitzer _ observations of a high - latitude cirrus cloud within the galaxy @xcite have revealed unusually strong @xmath2emission from regions that are clearly not associated with pdrs .",
    "shock heating is one possible explanation .",
    "these observations suggest that the excitation of @xmath2  in galaxy disks is not yet well understood .",
    "we have examined the excitation of gas , dust , and pahs and the physical conditions of the ism in two nearby normal edge - on disk galaxies , ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 , out to 15 kpc from the nucleus of each galaxy .",
    "our most important conclusions can be summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we have detected the rotational 17  @xmath0 m  s(0 ) and 28  @xmath0 m  s(1 ) @xmath2  line transitions at 5 and 10  kpc , and most interestingly , the s(0 ) @xmath2  line at 15  kpc nw from the nucleus of ngc  4565 .",
    "we have discovered that in these two edge - on galaxies , ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 , the warm molecular gas temperature (",
    "although uncertain ) and the ratio of the @xmath2  line luminosity surface density to the total infrared luminosity surface density are rather flat with radius . however , the active star formation rate , as measured by , e.g. , the 24  @xmath0 m emission , falls rapidly with radius .",
    "this result is potentially inconsistent with excitation of the @xmath2  emission by photodissociation regions in the outer disks of these galaxies .",
    "alternatives to the @xmath2  excitation in the outer disk are cosmic ray heating and shocks . based on the midplane radio continuum emission intensities , excitation by cosmic rays and photodissociation regions",
    "are both viable in the inner disk . however , in the outer disk the non - detection of radio continuum implies that cosmic rays are less important there .",
    "therefore , extended photodissociation regions or shocks can excite the emission at the outermost disk , as seen in ngc  4565 at the 15 kpc nw point .",
    "we see an increase of the 11.3  @xmath0m/7.7  @xmath0 m  pah feature strength ratio ( where we used the irac 8  @xmath0 m  band to be a proxy of the 7.7  @xmath0 m  emission ) at the 15 kpc nw position in ngc  4565 .",
    "we also see that the summed @xmath2  line intensity over the 8  @xmath0memission intensity ratio increases at the same position .",
    "our interpretation is that the @xmath2  s(0 )  28  @xmath0 m  emission at the 15  kpc nw position may still be excited by ( weaker ) emission from photodissociation regions , coming from a more neutral medium at this large distance from the nucleus , as the strength of the 7.7  @xmath0 m  pah feature , which traces more highly ionized dust , decreases with respect to the strength of the 11.3  @xmath0 m  pah feature , which traces more neutral dust .",
    "the observations strongly suggest that the warm molecular gas is smoothly distributed .",
    "assuming such an extended distribution , the detected mass surface densities of warm molecular hydrogen are very low at large radii in both galaxies .",
    "it is very unlikely that this component of the ism contributes at any significant level to the `` missing mass '' in the outer regions of these two edge - on disk galaxies .",
    "the seyfert 1.9 nucleus in ngc  4565 revealed [ ]  14.32  @xmath0 m , [ ]  24.31  @xmath0 m , [ ]  10.51  @xmath0 m , and [ ]  25.89  @xmath0mlines , as well as the 12.28  @xmath0 m  @xmath2  s(2 ) line .",
    "the higher excitation forbidden lines are expected to be seen in seyfert nuclei .    we are grateful to tom jarrett at ipac for helping us to correct the rogue pixels with his custom - made iraf script .",

    "<S> this suggests that the source of excitation of the @xmath2  operates over a large range of radii , and is broadly independent of the strength and relative location of uv emission from young stars . </S>",

    "<S> the inferred mass surface densities of warm molecular hydrogen in both edge - on galaxies differ substantially , being 4(60 ) m@xmath6 pc@xmath7 and 3(50 ) m@xmath6  pc@xmath7 at @xmath1 = 10 kpc for ngc  4565 and ngc  5907 , respectively . </S>",
