    "description of hadronic reactions at high energies requires knowledge of qcd in the perturbative and non - perturbative domains .",
    "however , such calculations can not be done in the straightforward way because the non - perturbative qcd is poorly - known .",
    "the most efficient approximation approach to theory of hadronic reactions is qcd factorization , where perturbative qcd calculations are complemented by phenomenological fits or model expressions which mimic non - perturbative qcd contributions . throughout the present paper",
    "we will address those expressions as non - perturbative inputs .",
    "technically speaking , such inputs act as initial conditions for the evolution equations which account for perturbative contributions .",
    "the inputs are supposed to approximately describe short - time dissociations of each of the colliding hadrons into active partons and spectators , with interactions of the active partons being described by perturbative qcd .",
    "there are various scenarios of such interactions , depending on the number of the active partons .",
    "the scenario where each hadron emits one active parton is called the single - parton scattering ( sps ) .",
    "it is the simplest and most popular scenario .",
    "more complicated scenarios , where one of the colliding hadrons or both of them emit more than one active parton are addressed as multi - parton scattering ( mps ) .",

    "there are several forms of qcd factorization available in the literature and each of them is tailored to a specific perturbative approach .",
    "we briefly consider them in the context of dis .",
    "the point is that none of the known evolution equations can operate in the whole range of @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in the region of @xmath15 ,",
    "the evolutions in the longitudinal sub - space ( we refer to it as the @xmath13-evolution ) and in the transverse sub - space ( the @xmath16-evolution ) are approximately independent and accounting for the @xmath16-evolution is most important .",
    "this evolution is governed by the dglap equations@xcite .",
    "they control to all orders in @xmath17 the evolution in the @xmath18-space from some starting point @xmath19 up to a higher scale @xmath14 , leaving the @xmath13-evolution either totally unaccounted for ( in lo ) or taken into account in few orders in @xmath17 ( in nlo , nnlo , etc ) .",
    "values of @xmath20 are chosen in the perturbative range : @xmath21 few gev .",
    "therefore , the @xmath16-evolution in dglap is controlled by perturbative means .",
    "in contrast , implementing the @xmath13-evolution is achieved through convoluting the dglap results with fits@xcite which , being implicitly @xmath20-depend , explicitly depend on the longitudinal variable . therefore ,",
    "those fits exploit the simplest , collinear kinematics for the connecting partons ( see fig .",
    "2 ) :    @xmath22    with @xmath23 ( @xmath24 in factorization convolutions ) being the longitudinal momentum fraction . such form of qcd factorization is called collinear factorization@xcite and @xmath20 in the factorization context is called the factorization scale .",
    "the approximation that the evolution in the @xmath16-space can be studied independently of the evolution in the @xmath13-space is reliable for @xmath15 but is known to fail at @xmath25 . in other words , factorization of the phase space into the longitudinal and transverse sub - spaces is broken at @xmath25 , so dglap becomes inconsistent at small @xmath13 and should be replaced by new evolution equations comprising the both @xmath13- and @xmath16-evolutions . for non - singlet structure functions , where the leading contributions are double - logarithmic ( dl ) ,",
    "it was done by composing and solving infrared evolution equations ( iree ) for the dis structure functions ( for application of iree to dis see the overviews in ref .",
    "the principal concept of iree was proposed by l.n .",
    "its essence is first to neglect the involved quark masses in order to deal with virtual quarks and gluons equally , then introduce an ir cut - off in the @xmath18-space to regulate ir divergences and study evolution of ir - dependent dl contributions with respect to such cut - off . in this approach",
    "the both @xmath13- and @xmath26- evolutions are accounted for with perturbative qcd , with @xmath20 acting as the ir cut - off and factorization scale at the same time , so one can use again collinear factorization , where new fits depend on @xmath13 weaker than the dglap fits .",
    "in contrast , the leading ( single - logarithmic ) contributions to the @xmath13-evolution of the structure function @xmath27 at small @xmath13 are ir stable .",
    "the best - known approach to account for them to all orders in @xmath17 is the bfkl equation@xcite .",
    "it is free of ir divergences and because of that integrations over transverse momenta in bfkl run down to zero .",
    "this approach operates with essentially non - collinear initial partons , which excludes neglecting their transverse components and as a result , it excludes a simple matching of bfkl with collinear factorization . by this reason ,",
    "@xmath0-factorization@xcite named also high - energy factorization@xcite was suggested .",
    "to parameterize momentum @xmath3 of the intermediate partons in factorization convolutions , @xmath0-factorization involves the same longitudinal parameter @xmath23 and , in addition , accounts for the transverse momentum @xmath18 :    @xmath28    there are different ways to construct the non - perturbative inputs in collinear and @xmath0- factorizations .",

    "then we proved that basic factorization can step - by - step be reduced to @xmath0-factorization and to collinear factorization . doing so , we did not specify non - perturbative inputs and inferred general theoretical constraints on the inputs .",
