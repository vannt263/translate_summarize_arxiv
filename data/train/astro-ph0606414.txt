    "while sgr a * itself is only weakly active at present , much of the high - energy activity in the gc is initiated apparently by the three young massive stellar clusters , located within 50 pc radius of the super - massive black hole sgr a * ( fig .  [ f : global ] ) : arches [ with an age of @xmath0 yrs ] , quintuplet [ @xmath1 yrs ] , and gc [ @xmath2 yrs ] ( e.g. , figer et al .",

    "massive stars themselves can be moderately bright x - ray sources ( e.g. , colliding stellar wind binaries ) .",
    "such stars also release large amounts of mechanical energy in form of fast stellar winds and supernovae , heating and shaping the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) and affecting the accretion of the black hole .",
    "furthermore , stellar end - products of massive stars ( neutron stars and black holes ) can also be strong x - ray sources .",
    "x - ray observations are thus a powerful tool for probing such high - energy phenomena and processes .",
    "the gc is a region where the spatial resolution of x - ray observations matters .",
    "this is why  has invested heavily on the gc , conducting repeated large - scale raster surveys [ existing 360 ks ( wang et al .",

    "the spatial resolution ranges from @xmath5 on - axis to @xmath6 at the outer boundaries of the field .",
    "while much of the data analysis is still ongoing , here i will first summarize some of the general results on detected discrete sources and diffuse x - ray emission and will then focus on the three massive star clusters , highlighting various high - energy phenomena and processes involved .",
    "the  observations have led to the detection of about 4000 discrete sources ; about 2400 of them are from the deep sgr a observations ( wang et al .",
    "2002a ; muno et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ; wang et al .",
    "most of these sources are located physically in the vicinity of the gc , judged from their x - ray spectral characteristics and number statistics . the number - flux relation ( or the so - called log@xmath7-log@xmath8 relation ) of the gc sources",
    "can be approximated as a power law with an index of @xmath9 .",
    "but the relation is flatter ( over the luminosity range of @xmath10 ) in the vicinity of the  and  clusters ( muno et al . 2006",
    "; wang et al .",
    "2006a ) , apparently due to the concentrations of massive stars and possibly their end - products .",
    "the gc x - ray sources represent a heterogeneous population of high - energy objects .",
    "bright sources ( 1e 1740.7 - 2942 and 1e 1743.1 - 2843 ) with 2 - 10 kev luminosities @xmath11 are low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "there is a clear dearth of x - ray sources with @xmath12 , although a few transients are detected in this intermediate luminosity range ( e.g. , muno et al .",
    "2005 ; sakano et al .",
    "2005 ; wijnands et al .",
    "2006 ; wang et al .",
    "sources within the range of @xmath13 tend to be colliding wind massive star binaries ( wang et al .",
    "2006a ) and possibly young pulsars ( wang et al .",
    "2002b ; wang et al .",
    "the nature of fainter sources ( @xmath14 ) are less certain ; many of them are likely to be cvs , consistent with the lack of bright stellar counterparts in near - ir and radio surveys ( e.g. , laycock et al .",
    "2005 ; bandyopadhyay 2005 ) .",
    "a fraction of these sources have very hard x - ray spectra ( e.g. , with power law photon indices less than 0 ; muno et al .",
    "such sources are most likely intermediate polars , in which x - ray - emitting regions are at least partially obscured and the observed x - rays represent the reflected emission ( ruiter , belczynski , & harrison 2006 ) .",
    "despite of their large number , the detected discrete x - ray sources typically account for only about 10% of the total observed x - ray emission from the gc .",
    "the spectra of the remaining `` diffuse '' emission and the accumulated spectrum of the sources are similar , in terms of both the continuum shape and the presence of prominent emission lines such as he - like s and fe k@xmath15 transitions , which indicate a broad thermal plasma temperature range of @xmath16 kev ( wang et al .",
    "2002a ; muno et al .",
    "the spatial distribution of the diffuse emission appears to follow closely the k - band stellar light ( muno et al .",
    "therefore , a bulk of the emission likely originates in the old stellar population ( coronally active binaries and cvs ) , as has been proposed for the galactic ridge hard x - ray emission ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "there is no clear evidence for a significant presence of truly diffuse gas with @xmath17 kev , as was believed for many years . but",
    "a non - thermal diffuse hard x - ray component does seem to be important ( wang et al .",
    "2002a ; see also the presentation by b. warwick ) .",
    "the strongest evidence for this component is the ubiquitous presence of the 6.4-kev line emission , globally correlated with the molecular gas in the gc region .",
    "the line emission arises from the filling of inner shell vacancies of neutral or weakly ionized irons , which can be effectively produced by ionizing radiation with energies @xmath18 kev . because of the high equivalent width ( @xmath19 kev ) of the observed line , the source of the ionizing radiation must be currently obscured or absent .",
    "this reflection interpretation gives the most convincing interpretation for the 6.4-kev line emission associated with the giant molecular clouds , sgr b2 and sgr c. the required ionizing source is believed to be sgr a * , which might be substantially brighter ( @xmath20 ) several hundred years ago .",
    "indeed , the continuum emission from sgr b , presumably due to the reflection through electron thompson scattering , is shown to have a hard x - ray spectrum ( power law photon index @xmath21 ) in the 2 - 200 kev range , consistent with what is expected from a typical agn ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2004 ) . however , the reflection interpretation is less successful in explaining the 6.4-kev line emission observed in fields closer to sgr a * ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "while the line intensity is globally correlated with the emission from trace molecules , a peak - to - peak correlation is often absent .",
    "the lack of such a correlation is not expected , because molecular clouds should be optically thin to the x - ray radiation .",
    "but it is possible that their density peaks may be optically thick to the emission such as cs ( j=2 - 1 ) .",
    "an alternative mechanism to produce the k - shell vacancies is the collision of irons with low energy cosmic ray electrons ( lecre ; valinia et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this case , one also expect a hard x - ray emission from the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "the problem with this mechanism is the low efficiency of the emission ( typically @xmath22 ) ; most of the energy is consumed in the ionization loss .",
    "it is not clear how the required energy density of the lecre could be maintained _ globally _ even in the gc region .",
    "[ f : global ] presents the global perspective of the  and  clusters in the gc environment .",
    "this most active region also includes various prominent thermal and nonthermal radio filaments , dense molecular clouds , and strong diffuse x - ray emission , all of which are concentrated on the positive galactic longitude side of sgr a@xmath23 ( wang et al .",
    "2006a and references therein ) .",
    "this lopsided distribution of these features may partly be a chance coincidence .",
    "but some of the features are likely to be related , although they seem to have very different line - of - sight velocities .",
    "the thermal mid - ir - emitting filaments are clearly due to the radiative heating of the  and  clusters , while the strong 6.4-kev line emission is associated with the dense molecular gas ( wang et al .",

    "this tunnel in projection is seen as the cavity and is apparently filled with hot plasma , responsible for the enhanced diffuse x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "[ f : global ] ; wang et al .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the lack of an enhanced near - ir extinction toward g0.13 - 0.13 and with the high excitation of molecular gas associated with the cloud , apparently due to shock - heating ( handa et al .",

    "the luminosity of the cluster falls several orders of magnitude short of the required .",
    "the most probable origin of the diffuse x - ray x - ray emission is then lecre that may be produced locally in and around the clusters ( wang et al .",

    "but the 3@xmath33 upper limit to the 0.3 - 8 kev luminosity , 3@xmath34 @xmath35 , is consistent with the nominal relation @xmath36 for massive stars .",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from the  cluster ( @xmath37 ) is about a factor of 10 lower than that from the  cluster and can be naturally explained by the cluster wind and a limited number of low - mass pre - main sequence young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "there appears to be a general deficiency of ysos in the two clusters , relative to the prediction from the standard miller & scalo initial mass function ( imf ) . compared with the x - ray emission from ysos in the orion nebula ( feigelson et al .",
    "2005 ) , the observed total diffuse x - ray luminosities from the arches and quintuplet clusters suggest that they contain no more than @xmath38 and @xmath39 ysos .",
    "these numbers are a factor of 10 and 5 smaller than what would be expected from the imf and the massive star populations observed in the cores of the two clusters .",
    "one possibility is that the imf flattens at intermediate masses , as indicated in a near - ir study of the inner regions of the   cluster ( stolte et al .",
    "the top heavy imf may be a result of the star formation in the extreme environment of the gc .",
    "in particular , collisions between dense molecular clouds such as g0.13 - 0.13 may be responsible for the formation of massive clusters .",
    "the deficiency of ysos in the gc cluster has been proposed by nayakshin et al .",

    ", they further conclude that it can not be a remnant of a massive star cluster that originated at several tens of parsecs away from sgr a * and then dynamically spiralled in .",
    "the gc cluster was thus most likely formed _ in situ _ in a self - gravitating circum - nuclear disk .",
    "therefore , the top heavy imf appears to be a general characteristic of star formation in the gc region .",

    "[ f : spec]b ; baganoff et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is a clear signature for the non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) state of the x - ray - emitting plasma with an ionization timescale @xmath41 ( wang et al .",
    "the source of the plasma is likely to be the stellar winds from massive stars in the gc cluster .",
    "we may assume that the pre - shock stellar winds are cold ( @xmath42 k ) and generally have velocities of @xmath43 ) .",
    "[ f : gc_x ] shows that the distribution of the stars is not very centrally concentrated , except for the compact sub - cluster complex irs 13 .",
    "the density of the shocked wind plasma is typically not very high ( order @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus , much of the shock - heated plasma may be out of the collisional ionization equilibrium , at least in individual wind - wind shock regions .",
    "further constraints on the properties of the plasma may be obtained from studying its interaction with individual stars or sub - clusters .",
    "the x - ray study of irs 13 provides such a possibility . the x - ray emission from this sub - cluster",
    "is clearly resolved and shows a non - nei plasma spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ f : spec]c ) .",
    "therefore , the source most likely represents stellar wind - wind collisions .",
    "the x - ray emission may be enhanced due to a strong ram - pressure confinement by the overall gc cluster wind , plus a potential outflow from sgr a * , as predicted in the radiatively inefficient accretion flow models ( yuan , quataert , & narayan 2003 ) .",
    "the confinement is indicated by the x - ray morphology that is slightly offset from the centroid position of irs 13 and elongated toward to the west ( wang et al .",
    "2006b ) .    the properties of the plasma around sgr",
    "a * should also affect its accretion .",
    "the quiescent x - ray emission from sgr a * is resolved to have a size of about a couple of arc - seconds .",

    "[ f : spec]d ; wang et al . 2006b ; xu et al .",
    "therefore , the flow is also in an nei state . a detailed modeling of the flow , confronted with the observed spatial and spectral distributions of the x - ray emission , will help to constrain the accretion dynamics .",
    "the x - ray emission from the gc region is complicated by the presence of a comet - like pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , a few arc - seconds northwest of sgr a * ( fig .",
    "[ f : gc_x ] ; wang et al .",
    "the suspected pulsar , presumably moving at a high speed relative to the ambient medium , is located at the northern head of the nebula .",
    "this pwn interpretation naturally explains not only the morphology , but also the nonthermal spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ f : spec]a ) and the spectral steepening with the off - source distance due to the synchrotron cooling of ultra - relativistic electrons ( and positrons ) .",
    "furthermore , the inverse - compton scattering of the intense ambient infrared photon field by the electrons provides a ready explanation for the tev emission from the gc ( aharonian et al .",
    "the lack of a synchrotron - emitting radio or infrared counterpart of the pwn is at least partly due to the fast compton - cooling ( hence little accumulation ) of relatively low - energy electrons , for which the klein - nishina suppression of the inverse - compton scattering efficiency is not important .",
    "the presence of this young pulsar raises a number of questions : where does it originate ? and where is the supernova remnant ?",
    "the most logic origin of the pulsar is the gc cluster itself .",
    "but the remnant is more difficult to isolate , the properties of which depend sensitively on the density and temperature structure of the medium ( e.g. , tang & wang 2005 ) . considering the orbital motion around sgr a * , it is even possible that the pulsar may be produced together with the well - known snr sgr a west , although an alternative pulsar candidate has already been proposed for the remnant ( see the contribution by s. park ) .    clearly , the above is a very incomplete and subjective review of recent _ chandra _ results on the gc .",
    "we will certainly learn a great deal more from the existing and upcoming _ chandra _ observations before gc-2009 workshop in china .",
    "some of the ideas presented above are developed during or after many stimulating discussions with workshop participants , to whom i am grateful .",
