    "the present discussion gives rise to the hope that the persistence length can become infinite after all .",
    "since @xmath208 in ( [ 7 ] ) corresponds to @xmath209 in the nonlinear @xmath99-model ( [ si9.145 ] ) , which possesses a smooth phase with long - range correlations , the @xmath72-fluctuations in the action ( [ @eeff ] ) may be violent enough to produce so many zeros in @xmath111 that @xmath176 and the persistence length in infinite , implying permanent quark confinement .",
    "but we also have learned that this may occur only with support from higher nonlinear terms in the curvature energy .",
