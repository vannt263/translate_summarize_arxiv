    "the temperature of an accreting neutron star s core and crust is a subject of much current interest , both for magnetic field evolution studies and thermonuclear burning ( @xcite and references therein ) . for neutron stars ( nss ) that steadily accrete at @xmath5 , balancing the recurrent heating from thermally unstable hydrogen / helium burning with the cooling from neutrino emission and radiative diffusion requires core temperatures @xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . for these accretion rates ,",
    "no more than a few percent of the hydrogen / helium burning luminosity diffuses inwards and heats the core ( @xcite , 1987 ) .",
    "there is an additional furnace in the inner crust ( densities above neutron drip , @xmath7 ) , where the compression of matter by accretion induces electron captures , neutron emissions , and pycnonuclear reactions that release @xmath8 ( @xcite ) .",
    "these reactions send most of their heat into the core and therefore play a more important role in maintaining the interior thermal balance of a constantly accreting neutron star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    for the case of transient accretors ,",
    "the heating of the interior is not so simple .",
    "most of the heat released by hydrogen / helium burning in the upper atmosphere leaves immediately during the unstable burning ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the time between accretion outbursts is much longer than the cooling time of the ns atmosphere . as a result",
    ", h / he burning alone can not heat the core to the interior temperatures of a steadily accreting star .",
    "this is an important point , since thermal emission from transiently accreting nss would be observable when accretion halts , if the core were sufficiently hot ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    ", we show that direct nuclear heating in the deep neutron star crust heats the interior much more strongly and naturally explains a large fraction of the quiescent emission seen from transient nss . during each outburst , the heat released from the crustal reactions flows into the core and maintains it at @xmath9 ( @xcite ) . once the core is in steady - state , the heat radiated during quiescence must equal the fraction of the heat deposited during the outburst . as we show in   2 , in quiescence",
    "the ns then emits a time - averaged luminosity @xmath10 . for time - averaged ( we here mean over the recurrence interval ) accretion rates of @xmath11 ,",
    "this amount of thermal emission is unavoidable unless the neutrino cooling is much more rapid than the standard mechanisms we considered .    of the ns transients detected in quiescence ,",
    "most have a luminosity @xmath12 , and the ratio of outburst to quiescent fluence is constant to within a factor of @xmath13 ( @xcite ) . the rough agreement between our estimate and observed values of @xmath14 gives new impetus for a thermal interpretation of the quiescent emission . as we discuss in ",
    "[ s : emission ] , spectral fits with realistic emergent spectra will show an increase in the emitting area over blackbody fits ( as in radio pulsars , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this alleviates one criticism of the thermal emission hypothesis , namely that the emitting areas are too small . of course",
    ", other luminosity sources , including accretion and a shock from a rotation - powered pulsar ( @xcite ) , may also occur along with thermal emission .",
    "an important challenge is to identify the luminosity fraction originating from the ns surface .",
    "accretion pushes a given fluid element in the crust ever deeper and forces the electron fermi energy to grow with time .",
    "the electrons eventually capture onto nuclei ( @xcite ) , which become progressively neutron rich and then fuse via pycnonuclear reactions .",
    "this heat is locally deposited in the crust about the thin layers in which the reactions occur .",
    "most of the heat is conducted into the core for a steadily accreting cool ns .",
    "the interior heats up , on a timescale of @xmath15 , until either the entire crust is nearly isothermal or , if the accretion rate is sufficiently rapid , until neutrino cooling balances the heating ( miralda - escud et  al .  1990 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is different for a transiently accreting ns . during an outburst",
    ", the reactions locally heat the crust at a rate @xmath16 and raise its temperature by @xmath17 . the layer in which the reactions occur ( _ shaded region _ , fig .  [",
    "f : structure ] ) is then hotter than both the atmosphere and the core .",
    "after the rapid accretion stops , the crust cools and its thermal profile relaxes to that of an isolated cooling ns , i.e. , the temperature monotonically increases with depth .",
    "while the crust heats and cools in response to the changing accretion rate , a fraction @xmath18 of the deposited heat flows inward and adds to the heat stored in the core , while a fraction @xmath19 flows outward and radiates away . by equating the sum of the quiescent luminosity from the cooling core",
    "( we use the core temperature - luminosity relation for an atmosphere with an accreted mass of @xmath20 ; @xcite ) and the neutrino luminosity ( modified urca : @xcite ; crust neutrino bremsstrahlung : @xcite ) with the energy deposited during the outburst , we determine @xmath21 .",
    "for example , using the core temperature - luminosity relation for a fully accreted envelope ( potekhin et  al .",
    "1997 ) implies @xmath22 .",
    "for these temperatures , neutrino cooling is unimportant .    ] ) , for a neutron star ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) accreting at @xmath25 .",
    "most of the nuclear energy ( 98% ) is released in the shaded region .",
    "the change in slope at the shaded region is caused by a reduction in the electron to baryon ratio . at @xmath26 ,",
    "the pressure goes from electron - dominated to neutron - dominated .",
    "[ f : structure ] ]    after many outbursts the core reaches an equilibrium limit cycle , in which the heat that it loses between outbursts ( the _ incandescent _ luminosity @xmath27 ) is replenished by the fraction @xmath18 of the nuclear energy deposited during each outburst .",
    "we expect that all observed transient nss will have long since reached this equilibrium limit cycle .",
    "the timescale to heat the core is much shorter than the lifetime of a low - mass x - ray binary ; at @xmath28 , the time to heat the core to equilibrium is less than @xmath29 for @xmath30 . since the energy injected into the crust during the outburst period @xmath31 reradiates during the recurrence interval @xmath32",
    ", we expect an average incandescent luminosity @xmath33 this relation , although simple , is not useful observationally because both sides of the equation depend on the source distance . to divide out this dependence , we rewrite equation ( [ e : lq ] ) in terms of fluences . the outburst fluence is @xmath34 and the incandescent fluence is @xmath35 .",
    "the ratio of the fluences is then simply @xmath36 because the core temperature can not appreciably change in a single outburst , there will be little change in the incandescent luminosity from one outburst cycle to the next .",
    "while the crust relaxes to a cooling thermal profile and radiates the fraction @xmath37 of the deposited energy , the neutron star luminosity asymptotically approaches @xmath27 on the thermal diffusion timescale ( @xcite ) , @xmath38 ^ 2 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx & 1{\\mbox{$\\rm\\,yr$}}\\left(\\frac{2{\\times 10^{14}}{\\mbox{$\\rm\\,cm$}}{\\mbox{$\\rm\\,s$}}^{-2}}{g}\\right)^2     \\left(\\frac{p}{10^{31}{\\,{\\rm ergs}}{\\mbox{$\\rm\\,cm$}}^{-3}}\\right)^{3/4}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the pressure , @xmath40 is the surface gravity , @xmath41 is the specific heat , and @xmath42 is the conductivity ( see @xcite for details ) . in figure",
    "[ f : structure ] we plot @xmath43 as a function of pressure for a ns accreting at @xmath44 .",
    "the thermal diffusion time in the crust is insensitive to the temperature and hence is almost independent of accretion rate .    for objects with lower outburst fluences ( e.g. , aql  x-1 , for which @xmath45 and @xmath46  days ) ,",
    "most of the heat is stored in the core , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "the reason is that the energy deposited in the outburst only raises the crust temperature by @xmath48 . as a result ,",
    "the luminosity radiated as the crust relaxes is only @xmath49 different from the incandescent luminosity . note",
    "that this argument does not hold for objects with similar @xmath50 but longer recurrence times , such as cen  x-4 and 4u  160852 .",
    "for these objects , the crust temperature can change by @xmath51 during an outburst , and so we expect @xmath52 .    figure [ f : luminosity ] displays @xmath53 ( @xmath14 is the observed quiescent luminosity ) as a function of @xmath54 for some ns ( _ filled squares _ ) and black hole ( bh ) ( _ open squares _ ) transients",
    ". note that the bh candidates appear uncorrelated compared to the nss .",
    "we also plot the relation for @xmath27 ( eq .  [ [ e : ratio ] ] ) for different values of @xmath18 .",
    "exo  0748676 has @xmath55 and from the diagram appears likely to accrete during quiescence .",
    "indeed , it is presently accreting ( as indicated by the _ rxte_/all - sky monitor ) at an even higher rate ( @xmath56 ) than when the @xmath14 for figure [ f : luminosity ] was measured .",
    "repeated observations after the ns goes into quiescence can discern the fraction of the heat radiated as the crust relaxes , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "the sum of this fluence and the incandescent fluence is just @xmath57 .",
    "these observations can in principle constrain @xmath40 , on which the thermal time strongly depends ( eq .  [",
    "[ e : thermal ] ] ) .",
    "to quiescent luminosity @xmath14 as a function of the ratio of recurrence interval @xmath32 to outburst duration @xmath31 .",
    "the lines are for different fractions , @xmath58 ( _ dashed line _ ) and @xmath59 ( _ solid line _ ) , of @xmath60  per baryon mass deposited at depths where the thermal time is longer than the outburst recurrence time .",
    "also plotted are the observed ratios for several nss ( _ filled squares _ ) and bhs ( _ open squares _ ) . for most of the bhs , only an upper limit ( _ arrow _ ) to @xmath14 is known .",
    "data is from chen et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , with the exception of @xmath14 for the rapid burster ( @xcite ) .",
    "for aql  x-1 and the rapid burster , @xmath61 and @xmath31 are accurately known ( _ rxte_/all - sky monitor public data ) ; for the remaining sources @xmath61 and @xmath31 are estimated from the peak luminosities and the rise and decay timescales .",
    "[ f : luminosity ] ]",
    "the expected heating in the crust naturally generates an incandescent luminosity @xmath27 that matches the observed values of @xmath14 .",
    "of course , the star may still accrete , either persistently or spasmodically , in quiescence ( @xcite ) .",
    "accretion onto the ns surface at low rates will also produce a thermal spectrum ( @xcite ) , so a further challenge is to distinguish between the two luminosity sources . if the ns does not accrete during quiescence , there will be ( 1 ) little variation in @xmath14 from one outburst cycle to the next ( we here mean the incandescent luminosity emitted after the crust has relaxed to a cooling thermal configuration ) , ( 2 ) a slow monotonic decrease in flux and @xmath62 while the crust relaxes after the outburst , ( 3 ) no short - term intensity fluctuations ( barring environmental effects ) , ( 4 ) stability of the ratio of the ns radius to distance ( as inferred from spectral fitting ) , and ( 5 ) an absence of metals in the spectra .",
    "the quiescent energy spectra of 160852 , cen  x-4 ( both observed with _",
    "asca _ ; @xcite ) , and aql  x-1 ( observed with _ rosat_/position sensitive proportional counter ; @xcite ) , when fit by a blackbody ( bb ) with an additional power - law tail for cen  x-4 , imply substantially smaller radii ( @xmath63 for 160852 , @xmath64 for cen  x-4 , and @xmath65 for aql  x-1 ) than expected from a ns for the best - fit bb temperatures ( 0.160.30 ) .",
    "these measured radii have puzzled observers and motivated the interpretation that either the quiescent ns luminosity does not originate from the surface or only some small fraction of the surface radiates .",
    "_ however , the emergent spectra at @xmath66 is very different from a bb . _",
    "the opacity is free - free dominated and is therefore proportional to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the photon frequency . as a result , higher energy photons escape from greater depths , where @xmath69 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectral fits of the wien tail with bb curves then overestimate @xmath62 and underestimate the emitting area , by as much as orders of magnitude ( @xcite ; zavlin et  al .",
    "simple comparisons between the observed spectra and the hydrogen atmosphere models imply larger emitting areas in all cases .",
    "an incandescent ns should have a pure h atmosphere because the time for heavy elements to settle out of the photosphere is @xmath70 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , if accretion continues in quiescence , there is an accretion rate , @xmath71 , above which metals are dumped into the atmosphere fast enough to maintain their abundance . _ in this case a measurable metal abundance may exist .",
    "_ in the absence of spallation ( which depends on the accretion geometry ) , metals will be underabundant relative to their infalling value for @xmath72 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath71 coincides with the accretion rate at which the resulting luminosity from quiescent accretion , @xmath73 , is comparable to the thermal emission . _",
    "if accretion alters the luminosity , it also alters the photospheric abundances . _",
    "the emergent spectra from an atmosphere with solar abundance metals is detectably different from that of a pure h atmosphere ( @xcite ) , mostly because of the gravitationally redshifted o  viii photoionization edge .",
    "this feature ( at @xmath74 in the rest frame of the ion ) , if detectable with _ xmm _ , would allow direct measurement of the gravitational redshift .",
    "thermal emission does not explain the hard power - law tail seen in both cen  x-4 ( @xcite ) and aql  x-1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "evidence of an additional luminosity source is also indicated by the fast ( timescales of order days ) variations in the quiescent flux observed from cen  x-4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "if a rotation - powered pulsar becomes operational in quiescence , the pulsar wind can interact with material in the ns environment , similar to that in the pulsar / be star system psr  125963 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the emission from the shock is most likely nonthermal , however , so future observations can distinguish the part of the spectrum contributed by thermal emission .",
    "recent observations of aql  x-1 as it faded into quiescence ( @xcite ; @xcite ) revealed an abrupt ( 1  day ) decay of the luminosity following a more gradual decline with a roughly 17  day timescale .",
    "after the sudden dimming , the luminosity persisted at @xmath75 for the remainder of the observation .",
    "both campana et  al .",
    "( 1998b ) and zhang et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) interpreted this sharp transition as the onset of the propeller effect ( centrifugal barrier ) .",
    "accretion at the low rates ( @xmath76 ) needed to explain @xmath14 is very difficult if the propeller is operational ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , accretion in spite of the propeller implies a flow onto the polar caps that would produce luminosity variations at the ns spin period , which are not seen .",
    "the propeller can be avoided only if the ns in aql  x-1 rotate with @xmath77 ( @xcite ) . interpreting the @xmath78 oscillation seen during a type i burst from aql  x-1 ( @xcite ) as the rotational frequency",
    "would then imply that @xmath79 .",
    "this magnetic field constraint relaxes substantially if thermal emission causes @xmath14 and makes more plausible the ns becoming an active millisecond radio pulsar .",
    "the steadiness of @xmath14 ( over a 20  day observation with _ bepposax _ , @xcite ) is naturally explained by thermal emission , provided that @xmath47 ( which we expect from the arguments in   2 ) .",
    "the incandescent emission from the hot ns has the correct magnitude to explain the observations without requiring any ad hoc assumptions .",
    "alternate explanations , such as accretion onto the magnetopause or shock emission from a rotation - powered pulsar ( @xcite ) , are unlikely to produce both a steady luminosity and a thermal spectrum , especially one with an emitting radius comparable to that of a ns .",
    "however , at least one other emission mechanism is required to account for the hard tail .    with the recent discovery of a @xmath80 accreting pulsar ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in the transient sax  j1808.43658 ( @xcite ) , an upper bound of @xmath81",
    "may be placed on the dipole magnetic moment if the magnetospheric radius is presumed to be less than the corotation radius .",
    "given a recurrence interval of @xmath82 , an outburst duration of @xmath83  days , and an outburst accretion rate of @xmath84 ( @xcite ) , we expect an incandescent luminosity of @xmath85 , which corresponds to an unabsorbed flux ( @xmath86 distance ) of @xmath87 .",
    "the inferred surface magnetic field and spin period are sufficient to power a rotation - powered pulsar .",
    "if this occurs , the magnetospheric emission is @xmath88 ( @xcite ) and may contaminate the thermal emission .",
    "we have demonstrated that reactions in the inner crust of an accreting ns heat the interior enough to make the ns incandescent after accretion halts .",
    "transiently accreting nss then radiate @xmath89 in quiescence .",
    "the quiescent emission is a thermometer that probes the heated deep crust and core . as in the case of isolated cooling nss ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , it may be possible to test for the presence of enhanced neutrino emissivities by placing limits on the interior temperature of the ns .",
    "upcoming missions will greatly increase our understanding of previously discovered transients and open up new populations for study .",
    "especially promising are the low - luminosity x - ray sources in globular clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "a subject of debate is whether the brighter sources of this class ( with @xmath90 ) are quiescent soft x - ray transients , as opposed to cataclysmic variables ( @xcite ) .",
    "if so , future x - ray observations can mine a potentially rich source of ns transients . with multiple quiescent nss in a single field of view",
    ", all at the same distance and reddening , comparisons between sources will be easier and radius determinations more certain .",
    "although in many ways distinct from the low - mass systems , the neutron stars in be transients ( @xcite ; @xcite ) should also behave as we have discussed .",
    "these nss have strong magnetic fields ( @xmath91 ) , show pulsations , and undergo a variety of outbursts ( @xcite ) .",
