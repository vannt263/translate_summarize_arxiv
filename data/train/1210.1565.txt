    "asymptotic - waveform evaluation ( awe ) is a long standing challenge in the computation of waves . whether for acoustic , electromagnetic , or gravitational waves the goal is to identify the far - field or asymptotic signal radiated to future null infinity @xmath5 using only knowledge of the solution on a truncated , spatially finite , computational domain . for the unit - speed ordinary wave equation , the far - field signal is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a solution to the wave equation written with respect to retarded - time @xmath8 and spherical polar coordinates @xmath9 . continuing with this example",
    ", we view computation of @xmath10 as awe , so long as the _ evaluation radius _",
    "@xmath11 can be taken arbitrarily large , even if ultimately finite . indeed , for the ordinary wave equation the asymptotic signal and signal at @xmath12 are identical to about double precision machine epsilon ( see appendix  [ sec : errorest ] for the error estimate ) .",
    "the asymptotic signal we compute corresponds to observation on the timelike hyper - cylinder @xmath13 . in the perturbative gravitational setting considered here , with @xmath14 in terms of the schwarzschild mass @xmath15 ,",
    "such observations take place in the _ astrophysical zone _",
    "an observation in the astrophysical zone is better approximated as taking place at @xmath5 rather than future timelike infinity @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "for this reason , and for clarity of exposition , throughout this paper we refer to such observations as taking place at @xmath5 .",
    "identifying the gravitational wave signal at @xmath5 is of both theoretical and practical importance .",
    "theoretically , in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes sachs @xcite identified the asymptotic metric factors corresponding to @xmath17 for gravitation , and exploited this identification in his discussion of the radiative degrees of freedom for general relativity .",
    "using geroch s calculation framework @xcite , ashtekar and streubel expanded on the sachs approach in their fundamental analysis @xcite of the symplectic structure of radiative modes and gravitational flux in general relativity .",
    "several works @xcite then investigated the general charge integral ( where the integration is over a two - surface  cut \" of @xmath5 ) corresponding to the ashtekar - streubel flux .",
    "the practical importance of awe stems from the upcoming generation of advanced - sensitivity ground - based gravitational wave interferometer detectors ( i.e. , advanced ligo , advanced virgo , and kagra ) @xcite and anticipated space - based detectors like lisa @xcite .",
    "these instruments are well - modeled as idealized observers located at @xmath5 .",
    "while the problem of awe for gravitation shares difficulties with its counterparts for the ordinary wave and maxwell equations , for example the slow fall - off of the waves ( in our case metric perturbations ) in powers of @xmath18 , the gravitational problem is further complicated by the backscattering of waves , coordinate ( gauge ) issues , and non - linearities .",
    "for a perturbed schwarzschild blackhole , covariant and gauge invariant approaches exist for the construction of  master functions \" from the spacetime metric perturbations ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in the asymptotic limit",
    "these master functions specify the gravitational waveform . here",
    "we consider the wave equations which directly govern these master functions . in this perturbative",
    "setting , awe is precisely the technique ( perhaps extrapolation , for example ) used to compute the master functions at arbitrarily large distances from the central blackhole .",
    "this paper introduces a new technique based on signal _ teleportation _ between two finite radial values .    a straightforward and longstanding approach to awe in both full general relativity @xcite and perturbative settings",
    "@xcite has been to record relevant field quantities at a variety of radii , perform a numerical fit , and then extrapolate to larger radii .",
    "however , the accuracy of this method ultimately relies on an _ ansatz _ for the expected fall - off of the field with larger @xmath19 , as well as recording field values at multiple and preferably large values of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach , known as cauchy characteristic extraction , is to record geometrical data from a cauchy evolution on a world - tube , which is later used as interior boundary data for a second characteristic evolution whose coordinates have been compactified to formally include @xmath5 within the numerical grid  @xcite .",
    "when the background coordinates are fixed , @xmath5 can be directly included within a cauchy evolution by a geometric prescription using hyperboloidal methods @xcite .",
    "another approach due to abrahams and evans shows how one may _ exactly _ evaluate asymptotic waveforms from gravitational multipoles for general relativity linearized about flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a new analytical and numerical method to evaluate asymptotic gravitational waveforms from perturbations of a non - spinning ( schwarzschild ) blackhole .",
    "it also presents new results on the asymptotic signal evaluation problem for the acoustic ( i.e.  ordinary ) wave equation .",
    "our approach is most similar to that of abrahams and evans . essentially , we reformulate their approach in a way which subsequently generalizes to blackhole perturbations .",
    "however , while our approach generalizes the abrahams - evans one to a curved background spacetime , we do not match their careful discussion of gauge issues .",
    "for the einstein equations linearized about minkowski spacetime in the lorenz gauge the trace - reversed metric perturbation obeys the flatspace ( ordinary dalembertian ) tensor wave equation .",
    "therefore , these perturbations are akin to solutions of either the ordinary wave equation or the maxwell equations ; solutions characterized by the sharp huygen s principle and , therefore , which possess secondary lacunae @xcite : given trivial initial data and an inhomogeneous source which is bounded in space and time , the solution vanishes on the intersection of all forward light cones whose vertices sweep over the support of the source .",
    "the secondary lacunae is a region of spacetime which is  dark \" because all waves have already passed .",
    "similar statements hold for the homogeneous case with non - trivial initial data of compact support .",
    "actually , for the maxwell case with certain sources , the solution may have a quasi - lacunae featuring a late - time static electric field @xcite .",
    "wave propagation on a curved spacetime is more complicated due to the backscattering of waves off of curvature . even within the relatively simple setting of perturbations of schwarzschild blackholes ,",
    "backscattering effects are present and the resulting late - time  tails \" @xcite have been extensively studied both theoretically and numerically .",
    "backscattering confounds our intuitive sense of  outgoing \" and  ingoing \" ; one might reasonably take the viewpoint that a partially backscattered wave has both outgoing and ingoing pieces .",
    "nevertheless , for the _ linear _ master equations which describe perturbations of schwarzschild blackholes , there is an unambiguous notion of  outgoing \" , provided initial data of compact support .",
    "away from the support of the initial data , laplace transformation of a master equation yields a _ homogeneous _ second - order ode , which therefore has two linearly independent solutions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is laplace frequency .",
    "here we have suppressed harmonic indices @xmath23 and assumed that the area radius @xmath19 is the independent spatial variable .",
    "we may assume that @xmath24 as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the regge - wheeler tortoise coordinate defined below .",
    "at a radial location beyond the support of the initial data , the frequency - domain solution has the form @xmath27 , where the details of the initial data are buried in the coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "physically , this notion of  outgoing \" would perhaps be better characterized as ",
    "asymptotically outgoing \" .",
    "nevertheless , provided the solution has this form , we can derive _ at a finite radius _ both time - domain boundary conditions @xcite and an awe procedure .",
    "the strategy in both cases is to write down the exact conditions / procedure in the frequency domain , and then accurately approximate this exact relationship in a fashion that allows for simple inversion under the inverse laplace transform .",
    "for the case of boundary conditions , one approximates the exact dirichlet - to - neumann map as a rational function ( in fact a sum of simple poles ) along the axis of imaginary laplace frequency ( the inversion contour ) .",
    "the exact time - domain boundary condition is a history - dependent convolution , which maybe approximated to machine precision as a convolution involving a kernel given by a small sum of exponentials .",
    "as we show , this type of kernel effectively localizes the history dependence .",
    "our reformulation of the abrahams - evans procedure ( and its generalization to curved spacetimes ) features a similar history - dependent convolution involving a sum - of - exponentials time - domain kernel .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] demonstrates that , in the ( laplace ) frequency domain , an awe kernel is exactly expressible as an ",
    "integral over boundary kernels \" , thereby allowing us to leverage existing codes and knowledge for generating and approximating boundary kernels . while the construction of awe kernels is computationally intensive , this is an _ offline _ cost .",
    "once the kernel has been calculated , efficient and accurate awe can be implemented within an existing code in a non - intrusive manner .",
    "furthermore , awe can be effected as a post - processing step on existing data recorded at a fixed radial location .",
    "kernels used in this paper , as well as others , will be available at @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : howto ] provides a self - contained guide on using boundary and awe kernels in either existing codes or data post - processing . towards this end ,",
    "section  [ subsec : qnrtails ] considers the numerical evolution of late time tails from an approximate asymptotic signal which we find to decay at the rate predicted for @xmath2 perturbations at @xmath5 .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] presents the theoretical underpinnings of both radiation boundary conditions and waveform teleportation , considering both wave propagation on flat ( minkowski ) and schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "for @xmath2 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 perturbations , section  [ subsec : pulset ] considers accurate signal teleportation to a finite ( near - field ) radial value . in section  [ subsec : luminosities ]",
    "we apply our method to compute gravitational waveforms and luminosities from extreme mass ratio binary systems , finding excellent agreement with frequency domain computations . in these studies",
    "we have observed that spurious junk radiation is problematic for accurate @xmath5 computations .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclude ] by discussing open issues , both theoretical and practical .",
    "our aim in this section is not to give a derivation of our awe method .",
    "rather , adopting the simplest possible evolution scheme and coordinates , we focus on how awe is implemented . by presenting an implementation of our awe method for a simple scheme , we hope to convey the key points to the reader , who will then grasp how to implement the method within their own evolution scheme .",
    "since our implementation of awe relies on certain radiation boundary conditions ( rbc ) , themselves essential when working on a spatially finite domain , we first describe how to implement these within our simple scheme . here",
    "we do not discuss our rbc and awe methods for different background coordinate systems ( i.e.  kerr - schild or hyperboloidal foliations ) , but return to this issue in appendix  [ sec : otherfol ] .",
    "multipole gravitational perturbations of a schwarzschild blackhole are described by the regge - wheeler ( axial ) and zerilli ( polar ) formalisms @xcite . in geometric units",
    "the corresponding  master \" wave equations have the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a possible source and in terms of the blackhole mass @xmath15 the regge - wheeler tortoise coordinate is @xmath33 , which we also denote by @xmath34 . until section [ subsec : luminosities ] ,",

    "while from the theoretical standpoint we prefer to view fields , for example @xmath49 , as depending spatially on @xmath19 , from a computationally standpoint we discretize eqs .   in @xmath34 .",

    "<S> in the context of blackhole perturbation theory , we describe both exact evaluation of an asymptotic waveform from a time series recorded at a finite radial location and its numerical approximation . from the user s </S>",
    "<S> standpoint our technique is easy to implement , affords high accuracy , and works for both axial ( regge - wheeler ) and polar ( zerilli ) sectors . </S>",
    "<S> our focus is on the ease of implementation with publicly available numerical tables , either as part of an existing evolution code or a post - processing step . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we also present a thorough theoretical discussion of asymptotic waveform evaluation and radiation boundary conditions , which need not be understood by a user of our methods . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we identify ( both in the time and frequency domains ) analytical asymptotic waveform evaluation kernels , and describe their approximation by techniques developed by alpert , greengard , and hagstrom . </S>",
    "<S> this paper also presents new results on the evaluation of far - field signals for the ordinary ( acoustic ) wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> we apply our method to study late - time decay tails at null - infinity ,  teleportation \" of a signal between two finite radial values , and luminosities from extreme - mass - ratio binaries . through numerical simulations with the outer boundary as close in as @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> we compute asymptotic waveforms with late - time @xmath1 decay ( @xmath2 perturbations ) , and also luminosities from circular and eccentric particle - orbits that respectively match frequency domain results to relative errors of better than @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that asymptotic waveforms are especially prone to contamination by spurious junk radiation . </S>"
