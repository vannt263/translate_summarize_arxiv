    "galaxies are known to harbour dust components whose representative temperatures are warm ( @xmath6 k ) and cold ( @xmath0 k ) .",
    "cold dust typically represents more than @xmath7% of the total dust mass in galaxies @xcite . despite the important role it plays by providing the dominant formation sites for molecular hydrogen -the fuel for star formation- relatively little",
    "is known about the spatial and temperature distribution of cold dust either in the milky way or in nearby galaxies .",
    "far - infrared ( ir ) flux at @xmath8 of nearby galaxies are localized to star forming regions , and have temperatures around @xmath9 k ; this warm component has been attributed to dust heating by uv photons from massive ob stars @xcite . at longer wavelengths , however , the sources responsible for the dust heating becomes less evident .",
    "dust grains with relatively large sizes @xmath10 can efficiently absorb photons longer than the uv @xcite , and may be heated also by stars which are not ob stars @xcite .",
    "we will refer to these stars as non - massive stars , which may heat large dust grains but are not ob type stars .",
    "longwards of @xmath11 , where the flux is sensitive to cold dust around @xmath0 k , the ir flux is known to be composed both from a diffuse disk component and flux concentrated near star forming regions @xcite with both components contributing significantly to the total ir flux @xcite .",
    "gaining information on the heating sources of such cold dust , requires that we obtain a temperature distribution map of various regions in a galaxy .",
    "dust grains in reality have a distribution of temperatures , but far - infrared and sub - millimeter observations have suggested that as a whole , they can be characterized by two ( warm and cold ) representative temperatures .",
    "measuring the temperature of dust in a galaxy requires observations at at least two wavelengths , preferably one on each side of the peak in the blackbody spectrum , which occurs around 150um for 20k dust .",
    "far - infrared data are sensitive to warm dust emission below @xmath12 which further hinders measurements of the temperature of the cold component @xcite .",
    "a key in circumventing this problem is observations at sub - millimeter wavelengths , up to @xmath13 .",
    "cold dust temperatures have been derived for numerous galaxies using sub - millimeter data ( e.g. , @xcite ) , showing that indeed cold dust below 20 k is ubiquitous in nearby galaxies , and is distributed on a large scale in star forming disks .",
    "a major setback of current ground - based sub - millimeter observations is the lack of sensitivity to faint and diffuse emission , making large - scale mapping projects of local group galaxies difficult .",
    "existing sub - millimeter observations of galaxies is therefore dominated by bright galaxies at moderate distances observed at resolution larger than several hundred parsecs @xcite which do not resolve individual star forming regions that are typically @xmath3 parsecs in size , or bright edge - on galaxies @xcite which do not enable the clear derivation of temperature distribution within the galactic disk .",
    "recent observations by the herschel satellite have revealed the effectiveness of deriving temperatures using sub - mm fluxes @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the temperature distribution of cold dust in a nearby , nearly face - on galaxy m  33 by means of a large - scale imaging observation at 1.1  mm .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows ; section 2 describes the observation and data reduction strategy , section 3 presents the obtained image .",
    "sections 4 presents the temperature distribution in m33 .",
    "section 5 further compares the dust temperature with data at various other wavelengths .",
    "section 6 summarizes the results and conclusions .",
    "observations of m  33 were conducted using the aztec instrument @xcite , installed on the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) @xcite , a 10 m single dish located in the atacama desert of altitude 4800 m in pampa la bola , chile .",
    "observations were remotely made from an aste operation room of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) at mitaka , japan , using a network observation system n - cosmos3 developed by naoj @xcite .",
    "basic parameters of m  33 are listed in table [ m33param ] .",
    "two square fields covering the northern and southern half of m  33 , each @xmath14 and overlapping by @xmath15 , where observed at 1.1  mm ( 270  ghz ) ( see figure [ aztec ] ) . at this wavelength ,",
    "the array field of view of aztec is @xmath16 with a detector fwhm of @xmath17 .",
    "the field was raster - scanned in the right ascension and declination direction alternately , in steps of @xmath18 at a scan speed of @xmath19 . since the aztec detectors are arranged in a hexagonal pattern , this scan step results in a nyquist - sampled sky with uniform coverage .",
    "observations were conducted in july 2007 and august 2008 , during a total observing time of 40 hours including calibration and pointing overheads .",
    "approximately 30 hours were spent on - source .",
    "the zenith opacity at 220 ghz ranged from 0.01 to 0.2 , with an average of 0.06 .",
    "telescope pointing was monitored every two hours using the bright quasar j0238 + 166 .",
    "the pointing was accurate to @xmath20 during the observing runs .",
    "uranus or neptune was observed twice per night in order to measure the relative detector pointing offsets and their point spread functions .",
    "these measurements are also used for determining the absolute flux calibration .",
    "relative flux calibration error is estimated from the flux variation of j0238 + 166 , which was 10% . since j0238 + 166",
    "is a variable source , this represents a conservative overestimate of the calibration error . adding in quadrature with the 5% uncertainty in the brightness temperature of uranus @xcite , the total absolute flux calibration error is better than 11% .",
    "the effective beamsize after beam - smoothing the reduced maps , was @xmath21 .      since the raw signals at 1.1  mm are dominated by atmospheric emission , we removed the atmospheric signals using an adaptive principal component analysis ( pca ) technique @xcite .",
    "the pca method identifies and subtracts the common - mode signal seen across the bolometer array for each scan .",
    "the pca calculation is done in the time - domain data , then each scans are mapped and co - added to obtain the final image .",
    "noise is estimated by `` jack - knifing '' the individual datasets ( that is , multiplying each individual time - stream scans randomly by + 1 or -1 ) before the map making .",
    "this cancels out true astronomical signals while preserving the noise properties of the map , resulting in a realistic representation of the underlying noise .",
    "details of the pca method are explained in @xcite .",
    "the pca method is optimized for the detection of point sources , by subtracting any extended signals as atmospheric emission .",
    "therefore , extended emission from m  33 will also be largely subtracted in this process .",
    "we use an iterative flux recovery approach called fruit to retrieve extended emission from m  33 .",
    "the algorithm is briefly explained below .",
    "the idea of the iterative flux recovery approach has already been implemented @xcite on bolocam , a bolometer identical to aztec , on the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "the fruit code used in this study was developed by the aztec instrument team at university of massachusetts ( umass ) , and explained in @xcite .    structures with scales larger than a several arcmin are removed by the pca technique because they introduce a correlated signal to the detectors which is indistinguishable from atmospheric variations .",
    "the residual image created by subtracting the pca cleaned data from the original dataset therefore still contains true astronomical signals which are more extended than what is obtained from pca cleaning .",
    "the fruit algorithm utilizes this residual data , by pca cleaning them again and adding the result to the initial result of pca .",
    "the idea is somewhat analogous to the clean method @xcite used commonly in interferometric observations at mm wavelengths .",
    "the observed map of the aztec instrument in scan @xmath22 , @xmath23 , can be categorized into three types of signals .",
    "these are the atmospheric signal @xmath24 , the true astronomical signal @xmath25 , and noise @xmath26 .",
    "note that the astronomical signal is independent of scan .",
    "although @xmath25 is the parameter we wish to derive , we can only construct the best estimator for @xmath25 using various algorithms , which we write @xmath27 . in pca",
    ", we construct an estimator @xmath28 from @xmath29 ( where the lower case represents the time - domain analog of the upper case maps ) , and co - add these @xmath28 to obtain @xmath27 .",
    "the fruit algorithm works iteratively in the following way ;    1 .",
    "construct @xmath28 from @xmath29 using pca .",
    "2 .   construct @xmath27 by co - adding @xmath28 .",
    "this is where pca finishes .",
    "construct a residual , @xmath30 .",
    "ideally , this should be astronomical signal free . in practice",
    ", it still contains extended emission .",
    "pca clean the residual @xmath31 and obtain map @xmath32 5 .",
    "construct the _ new _ estimator , @xmath33 .",
    "go back to step 3 .",
    "the iteration continues until no pixels have signal - to - noise of over 3.5 .",
    "the 1.1  mm image obtained from the fruit algorithm is shown in figure [ aztec ] , and the noise map obtained by jack - knifing the residual maps in figure [ noise ] .",
    "this algorithm was tested by embedding two dimensional gaussian components with fwhm of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 and various peak intensities in the original data , and measuring the fraction of the extended flux recovered with this iterative cleaning method .",
    "we find that this technique retrieves 90% of the flux in extended structures up to @xmath35 , and @xmath37 for structures with angular sizes of @xmath36 .",
    "results of this test are summarized in table [ embed ] .",
    "the results are consistent with the same test done in @xcite , and shows that the 1.1  mm flux obtained at the scale of few arcminutes are reasonable .",
    "the northern and southern halves of the galaxy were mapped using fruit individually , and then merged by weighting the overlapping region by the inverse square of their noise level .",
    "regions with less than 50% coverage in each of the northern and southern halves were clipped from further analysis .",
    "the final maps are constructed at @xmath38 per pixel .",
    "the root mean square ( r.m.s . ) of the resulting noise map is @xmath39 in the central @xmath40 , increasing to @xmath41 in the outermost regions where scientific analysis is conducted ( see figure [ noise ] ) .    as a further test of how much extended emission",
    "is recovered in the reduction , we apply the same technique as in @xcite , by applying the fruit algorithm to spitzer @xmath42 data ( see section 4.1 ) to see the level of flux loss .",
    "the test was done on the northern half of m  33 .",
    "the spitzer data were first scaled so that the flux level was similar to aztec data , to ensure that the same filtering was applied .",
    "the scaled data were then added to the aztec noise map in the time - stream domain , and then the pca and fruit algorithms were applied .",
    "the left and right panels of figure [ sim_image ] show the mips map prior to and following the pca+fruit reduction , respectively .",
    "the most extended features at scales over @xmath43 are clearly subtracted out , but smaller scale features @xmath44 are retrieved .",
    "the total flux recovered by fruit was 54% of the input flux , but when restricted to pixels with s / n over 2 in the fruited image , 97% of the total flux was recovered .",
    "figure [ sim_data ] shows the output flux as a function of input flux , only for pixels with a local s / n over 2 in the output map .",
    "the 1@xmath45 standard deviation of the points in figure [ sim_image ] around the line of unity is 44% .",
    "although this is a simulation using mips images , we regard this as a representative uncertainty of the flux measurements in the aztec map .",
    "it is likely to be an overestimate of scatter , because millimeter emission is often more clumpy than at far - ir ; clumpy structures are retrieved by fruit more efficiently than smooth features .",
    "added in quadrature with the absolute calibration error of 11% ( section 2 ) , the pixel based flux uncertainty of the m  33 map is 45% after pca+fruit reduction .",
    "the simulation implies that smaller scale structures ( typically smaller than @xmath36 ) retrieved in the pca+fruit are accurate to this uncertainty and recovered to 97% if detected at s / n over 2 , but larger scale features are subtracted out and are not quantified by the 45% uncertainty .",
    "figure [ contour ] shows the obtained 1.1  mm contour map of m33 , overlaid on a narrow - band h@xmath46 image . at the distance of 840 kpc for m  33 @xcite ,",
    "the angular resolution of @xmath21 corresponds to @xmath47 pc .",
    "a clear spiral pattern is observed , coincident with the optical arms .",
    "the 1.1  mm continuum is detected out to a radius of @xmath2 kpc , which is coincident with the edge of the star forming disk @xcite .",
    "almost all of the 1.1  mm clumps are observed to be associated with star forming regions as seen in the h@xmath46 .",
    "this is consistent with previous observations in the far - ir @xcite .",
    "an extended disk is not observed , however , presumably due to the subtraction of extended features during the data reduction process .",
    "although the global 1.1  mm morphology is similar to that seen in h@xmath46 , the contamination of free - free bremsstrahlung to 1.1  mm is expected to be negligible .    for optically thin hii regions observed at frequencies higher than few hz , the free - free emission can be written in the form ; @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the electron number density and electron temperature of the hii region , respectively .",
    "@xcite observed m  33 at @xmath51 cm ( @xmath52 ghz ) , where the flux is dominated by synchrotron radiation and thermal free - free emission . from @xcite , the typical @xmath51 cm emission seen in the hii regions have peak fluxes of @xmath53 .",
    "taking into account the typical thermal fraction of hii regions as @xmath54 ( @xcite ) , and scaling by equation [ freefreeeq ] , we obtain the @xmath55 mm flux estimate of free - free emission at hii regions , of @xmath56 .",
    "this is barely detectable with the r.m.s noise of our observations , which goes down to @xmath57 . for regions which we will discuss in the following sections , the @xmath55 mm flux is typically @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the free - free contribution to the @xmath55 mm flux is at most around @xmath59 .",
    "we will therefore assume hereafter that the @xmath55 mm flux is the pure flux from the cold dust continuum .",
    "the number probability density function ( pdf ; distribution of fluxes values in each pixel ) of the whole aztec map was used to obtain a realistic estimate of the total 1.1  mm flux .",
    "this was done in place of the normal aperture photometry , in order to circumvent the possibility of including significant negative pixels in the total flux which can be added by the pca method .",
    "it can also deal with large scale correlated noise , which may have systematic effects on the total flux .",
    "figure [ pdf ] shows the pdf of the aztec map , clipped where the r.m.s .",
    "noise level exceeded @xmath60 , within which we have done any analysis .",
    "the faint end of the distribution , dominated by noise , is well fitted by a gaussian with a dispersion of @xmath61 .",
    "this shows that any negative pixels introduced by the pca method and fruit retrievals , are offset by any positive values introduced , so that the sum of all the pixels in the aztec image still represents the true observed total flux of m33 reasonably well .",
    "the sum of all pixels with values larger than @xmath62 , or about -3 @xmath45 , was 10.0 jy . including all pixels below @xmath62 ,",
    "the total flux is 9.9 jy .",
    "no pixels had values lower than @xmath63 .",
    "the flux retrieval simulation using mips measurements in the previous section showed that fruit retrieved @xmath64 50% of the total flux when no restrictions to the signal - to - noise ratio are given , so the intrinsic @xmath55 mm flux is be estimated to be @xmath64 20 jy , which can be regarded as the flux upper limit .",
    "therefore , a range of @xmath65 jy gives a reasonable estimate of the total observed @xmath55 mm flux of m  33 .",
    "we retrieved the @xmath66 multiband imaging photometer ( mips : @xcite ) datasets ( aors 3648000 , 3648256 , 3649024 , 3649280 , 3650048 , 15212032 and 15212288 ) of the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) created by spitzer science center ( ssc ) pipeline from the spitzer space telescope @xcite data archive .",
    "individual frames were processed using mopex @xcite version 18.4 , rejecting outliers and background - matching overlapping fields .",
    "each mosaics of dimension @xmath67 were co - added using wcs coordinates .",
    "the co - added image was then background - subtracted by selecting several regions away from m  33 ( by more than @xmath68 ) , fitting , interpolating and subtracting a first order plane .",
    "the 1@xmath45 background noise level was measured at several regions well away from the disk of m  33 , which was at most @xmath69 per @xmath70 pixel .",
    "the flux error of @xmath71 is the sum of the error in zero - point magnitude of @xmath72 , and in the conversion from instrumental units to @xmath73 of @xmath74 ( both from _ spitzer _ science center home - page ) .",
    "additionally , the background noise level of @xmath75 must be taken into account .",
    "the weakest features for which the temperature was derived ( in the outermost disk ) has a @xmath71 intensity of @xmath76 , so background noise can account for up to @xmath77 .",
    "all errors taken into account , the pixel - to - pixel @xmath71 flux should be accurate to @xmath78 .",
    "the angular resolution ( fwhm ) of the point spread function is @xmath21 .",
    "the total @xmath66 flux measured within a @xmath79 aperture ( regions inside the aperture but outside the observed region were masked by null ) was @xmath80 , well within the uncertainties of the measurements by @xcite , @xmath81 , so the mips data reduction presented in the previous section is consistent with other studies in the literature . in the sed fit",
    "explained below , we use the @xmath42 value by @xcite .",
    "far - ir flux measurements at other wavelengths are listed in table [ sedflux ] .",
    "the far - ir sed is known to be successfully represented by two - component modified blackbodies shortwards of 500 @xmath82 in various regions within the galaxy @xcite , and we assume a two - component spectrum also .",
    "this assumption can break down if there is significant contribution from the free - free thermal component at the long wavelengths ( but see section 3 ) , or significant contribution from non thermal - equilibrium dust ( very small grains with small heat capacity ) exist at the shortest wavelengths @xmath64 24 @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the flux @xmath83 at various ir bands were fitted with a two - component modified blackbody model of the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants , @xmath87 is the assumed dust emissivity index , and @xmath88 is a planck function at temperature t. the chi - square fitted result is shown in figure [ sed ] .",
    "we obtained @xmath89 k , @xmath90 k and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the reduced chi - square value . for a single component modified blackbody with varying @xmath93",
    ", we obtain @xmath94 k , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , so this high reduced chi - square value rules out a single component modified blackbody spectrum . considering the uncertainty of @xmath93 and that many previous studies have derived @xmath97 @xcite",
    ", we keep @xmath87 constant hereafter .",
    "our derived global cold dust temperature @xmath98 should be considered an slight overestimate , since extended features are subtracted in the data reduction ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "if we use the corrected 1.1  mm flux estimate of 20 jy , we obtain a cold dust temperature of @xmath99 k. this temperature and the corrected 1.1  mm flux is consistent with extrapolations of the far - ir sed to 1.1  mm in previous measurements @xcite and the recent value derived from herschel @xcite .    using the observed 1.1  mm flux of 10 jy and cold dust temperature of 18 k , and assuming optically thin dust and a dust emissivity of @xmath100 @xcite",
    ", we obtain a total observed dust mass of @xmath101 . for an estimated intrinsic flux of 20 jy and the resulting temperature of 16 k ,",
    "the dust mass becomes @xmath102 .",
    "the neutral atomic mass is @xmath103 @xcite and the molecular gas mass is estimated to be @xmath104 from co observations @xcite , so the total dust - to - gas ratio is derived to be @xmath105 .",
    "an important indication from figure [ sed ] is that the two different temperature components both contribute significantly at wavelengths around and below @xmath106 , whose fluxes combined with fluxes @xmath107 , are used commonly to discuss the temperatures of the cold dust component .",
    "this can significantly overestimate the cold dust temperature .",
    "@xcite gave a cold dust temperature declining from @xmath108k to @xmath109k in m  33 using the color temperature of @xmath110 combined with @xmath71 , but at @xmath111 , figure [ sed ] shows that the two dust components contribute almost equally .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also show that wavelengths shortwards of @xmath112 are contributed significantly by star formation . although color temperatures derived using only the two bands @xmath113 and @xmath114 can still suffer from variations in @xmath93 ( see section 4.5 ) , it gives a more reasonable representation of the colder component and its characteristic temperature @xmath98 compared to attempts using shorter wavelengths .",
    "the color temperature was derived using @xmath115 which is obtained from equation ( [ twocomponenteq ] ) at two wavelengths , for a single temperature component .",
    "equation ( [ eqcolortemp ] ) was solved numerically to obtain the correspondence between observed flux ratio and the color temperature , and interpolated to the observed ratios .",
    "uncertainties were estimated from the flux uncertainties in the 1.1  mm flux of 45% ( section 2 ) and 160 @xmath82 of 16% ( section 4.1 ) , which added in quadrature results in an flux ratio uncertainty estimate of 48% . at temperatures of 10 k , 18k , and 20 k ,",
    "the flux ratio @xmath116 is 20 , 120 , and 160 , corresponding to color temperature uncertainties of 0.9 k , 2.3 k , and 2.8 k , respectively .    in the actual derivation",
    ", the region corresponding to the observed aztec field was cut out from the @xmath71 image , and further re - gridded to the same pixel size ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "field of view did not include the northeastern and southwestern edge regions , and are excluded from temperature analysis .",
    "the two images were then divided pixel - by - pixel , using only those pixels where @xmath55 mm fluxes exceeded @xmath118 ( the characteristic 1@xmath45 noise level of the map , but @xmath119 for most cases .",
    "see figure 2 . ) and @xmath66 flux exceeded the @xmath120 noise level of @xmath121 , to ensure that the flux ratios are not affected by noise ( virtually no cuts were made for @xmath66 data using this criterion , however ; all regions where the map satisfied the @xmath55 mm criterion had @xmath122 in the _ spitzer _ map ) .",
    "the flux ratios were then converted into temperature using the numerical solution to equation [ eqcolortemp ] .",
    "the obtained cold dust temperature map is shown in figure [ temp ] .",
    "the color temperature derived for the global flux was 21 k for the total observed flux of 10 jy , and 18 k for the estimated total intrinsic flux of 20 jy .",
    "these values are within the uncertainties presented for temperature derivation using two - component modified blackbody fits in section 4.2 .",
    "a prominent feature evident from the temperature map , is that the local variation of temperature at small scales of several arcminutes ( @xmath123pc ) is small compared to the global variation seen at kpc scales , namely the temperature decrease observed from the center outwards .",
    "only a few intense star forming regions are found to have temperatures slightly higher than the surrounding dust , and the bulk of dust seems to be at temperatures that follow a global trend .",
    "this is unexpected in the case where recent star formation governs the dust temperature , because star formation varies its intensity at small scales .",
    "the smooth distribution of temperatures despite the range of star formation intensities in these regions , show that the observed concentration of 1.1  mm flux nearby star forming regions is simply the result of more dust being there , not a higher temperature .    for each of the arcminute - sized clumps in the map , the temperature seem to be higher at the edges compared to the inner regions .",
    "this may be caused by the data reduction procedure , since the flux retrieval fraction of extended features decrease with increasing source size . at large scales , the 1.1  mm flux",
    "is underestimated , giving a higher temperature .",
    "figure [ gradient ] shows the radial temperature gradient , constructed from figure [ temp ] averaged over radial bins of @xmath124 width , which is chosen to mitigate the effect of temperature variations at the edges of arcminute structures .",
    "the declining temperature gradient is clearly apparent .",
    "only a few cold dust temperature gradients have previously been found ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to note that this gradient is found even though the 1.1  mm emission is found predominantly where star formation is active ; even for dust associated with star forming regions at @xmath3 pc scales , m  33 has a smooth temperature gradient which varies globally .",
    "as discussed in section 2.1 , the total flux retrieved by fruit for _ spitzer _ @xmath125 data was 54% .",
    "we can also assumed this to be the fraction of flux lost in the 1.1  mm data analysis , i.e. , @xmath64 10 jy ( section 3 ) .",
    "such 1.1  mm flux would reside in extended structures typically over @xmath43 , corresponding to @xmath64 1.2 kpc .",
    "extended dust disks of kilo - parsec size have been detected in the sub - millimeter range @xcite , and the existence of such a structure in m  33 would be the obvious candidate of structures which may be lost in the data processing .",
    "if this extended dust disk had a radially declining flux distribution , more 1.1  mm flux would be lost in the central regions , giving a higher dust temperature when compared with @xmath125 data .",
    "this can mimic a temperature gradient .",
    "below we attempt to estimate that this effect can have on our derived temperature gradient .",
    "we assume here that the total flux missed by 1.1  mm data analysis is 10 jy , and that it forms a smooth exponential disk as in @xcite , with a scale radius of 2.4 kpc as derived from both the @xmath125 @xcite and co observations @xcite .",
    "an exponential disk gives more extended flux to the central region , thus can be considered to be the worst case scenario , while giving a physically plausible model .",
    "the dust temperature was recalculated by accounting for this model in the 1.1  mm flux for the flux ratio r in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "the resulting temperature profile is shown as green dashed lines in figure [ gradient ] .",
    "although the temperature decreases in the central few kpc by 1 - 2 k , a radial decline is still apparent .",
    "properties of dust grains ( i.e. , size distribution and optical properties ) are usually expressed in terms of their dust grain emissivity index @xmath93 .",
    "although we have used a fixed @xmath93 for our analysis , grain properties and their size distribution may vary within a galaxy thus changing @xmath93 ; this corresponds to the case where a two temperature decomposition of the sed is not valid , and must include a range of temperatures .",
    "this is expected theoretically @xcite , and a wide range of dust temperatures have actually been observed in our galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "variations in @xmath93 can alter the derived cold dust temperature .",
    "in particular , a radial variation in @xmath93 may be able to mimic a temperature gradient .",
    "for the temperature gradient in figure [ gradient ] to be entirely explained instead by a constant temperature at 20 k and variation in @xmath93 , @xmath93 must be @xmath126 in the central regions and decreasing to @xmath127 in the outer several kilo - parsecs .",
    "although variations in @xmath93 are known to be @xmath128 @xcite in the milky way , systematic variations with respect to regions within a galaxy have not been reported .",
    "furthermore , low values of @xmath93 around 1 - 1.5 are typically found near individual proto - stars @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that the characteristics of dust found in such circumstellar environments dominate over the outer region of m33 at kilo - parsec scales .",
    "although small radial variations in @xmath93 can not be ruled out with our current dataset , a global temperature gradient seems to more plausibly explain the flux ratio gradient between 1.1 mm and 160@xmath1 .",
    "in order to assess the heating sources of cold dust within sub - regions of the galaxy , we performed aperture photometry around individual hii regions , and compared the dust temperature with properties at various wavelengths .    the @xmath5 band ( @xmath129 ) can be used to trace the stellar distribution and the contribution of non - massive stars to the interstellar radiation field which heats the dust .",
    "the @xmath5 band image of m  33 was taken from the @xmath130 large galaxy survey catalog in the nasa / ipac infrared science archive .",
    "the image was background subtracted using a planar fit to regions well away from the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath5 band flux can be contaminated by a variety of sources other than non - massive stars .",
    "they are the nebular and molecular emission lines @xcite , and hot dust @xcite .",
    "observations of star clusters have found that star clusters can have excess h - k colors due to these contributors by at most 0.5 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "we thus apply this conservative estimate of 0.5 magnitudes ( 40% ) on the errorbar for the stellar component of the @xmath5 flux .",
    "the ionizing flux from massive ( ob ) stars can not be measured directly because of severe ly@xmath46 extinction , but we may estimate the measure of the number of ob stars by a combination of h@xmath46 and 24@xmath1 warm dust continuum , as done by @xcite to derive extinction - corrected star formation rates .",
    "the h@xmath46 image is from @xcite , and the 24@xmath1 from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "the scale factor when adding h@xmath46 and 24@xmath1 is 0.031 , given by @xcite in order to minimize the dispersion of the combined star formation rate to that derived from pa@xmath46 flux .",
    "the dispersion is 20% , which we take to be the uncertainty in the measure of ionizing flux .",
    "uncertainties from aperture photometry were negligible compared to 20% .",
    "details of the data reduction and preparation for the 24@xmath1 image is found in @xcite .",
    "the hii regions to perform aperture photometry on were searched from the literature with spectroscopic oxygen abundances @xcite .",
    "a box with @xmath131 on the side and centered on the hii region coordinate , was used to locate the flux weighted center of each of the images within that box .",
    "this centroid pixel was used as the center of the photometric apertures .",
    "this is because dust peaks are not always coincident with the h@xmath46 or @xmath5 peaks , typically by several to @xmath132 , corresponding to under 40 parsecs .",
    "all regions were then inspected by eye to ensure that the measured emission was associated with the hii region .",
    "flux from a total of 57 regions were measured in each of the 1.1  mm , 24 @xmath1 , 160@xmath1 , h@xmath46 and @xmath5 band images each using a circular aperture with a radius of @xmath133 .",
    "the cold dust temperature was derived from the 1.1  mm , 160@xmath1 using integrated fluxes from the photometry .",
    "no local background was subtracted using an annuli in the photometry process , because most of the sources measured here are both crowded and extended .",
    "an aperture correction factor of 1.745 , taken from the mips instrument handbook version 2.0 , was applied to the 160 @xmath82 photometry , for 30 k dust with no sky annulus subtraction .",
    "figure [ t - k - sfr ] shows the relation between cold dust temperature , @xmath5 band , and the measure of ionizing flux .",
    "a clear correlation is seen between the cold dust temperature t and @xmath5 flux .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath134 is 0.71 .",
    "conversely , the correlation between t and ionizing flux is less evident , with @xmath135 .",
    "uncertainties in aperture photometry or temperature are not sufficient to explain the difference in the dispersion .",
    "the fact that ionizing flux from massive stars do not correlate with the dust temperature implies that these stars are not responsible for heating the dust observed here , whereas stars seen in the correlated @xmath5 band are a strong candidate for dust heating .",
    "although flux from the rayleigh - jeans tail of the ionizing stars can potentially contribute also to the @xmath5 band , they can not be the major dust heating source in this case , because if so the correlation should be strong both in @xmath5 and the ionizing flux .",
    "similarly , the contribution of diffuse h@xmath46 and 24@xmath82 emission to the photometry , likely due to energy input from evolved stars @xcite , can not explain a stronger correlation between cold dust temperature t and @xmath5 flux , compared to the combined h@xmath46 and 24@xmath82 .",
    "this lends strong support to non - ionizing stars as the heating source of cold dust , even in the small scale star forming regions discussed here .",
    "this paper presented a large scale 1.1  mm mapping observation of m  33 , the most proximate face - on spiral galaxy in the local universe .",
    "the 1.1  mm continuum is detected out to @xmath2 kpcs , where the edge of the star forming disk lies . by comparing the 1.1  mm data with spitzer mips 160@xmath1 imaging",
    ", we obtained the color temperature distribution of cold dust , without significant contribution from warm dust as in most previous studies .",
    "furthermore , aperture photometry was performed on star forming regions to compare the cold dust temperature with @xmath5 band flux , representing radiation from non - massive stars , and h@xmath46+@xmath136 flux , representing ionizing radiation from massive stars .",
    "the following results are found .    *",
    "the 1.1  mm continuum is spatially correlated with star forming regions as traced by h@xmath46 , and comprise a clear spiral structure .",
    "* the temperature of cold dust shows a smooth distribution over the entire disk .",
    "the concentration of 1.1  mm flux observed near the star forming regions are the result of more dust mass concentration in these regions , not a higher dust temperature .",
    "* the temperature of cold dust shows a radially declining gradient , even though the detections are restricted to near the star forming regions .",
    "this is unlikely explainable instead by a gradient in the dust emissivity index @xmath93 . * a comparison in individual star forming regions with an aperture @xmath133 in radius , or @xmath137 pc in diameter",
    ", shows that the cold dust temperature is correlated strongly with the local @xmath5 band flux . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature does not show a marked correlation with the ionizing flux , measured by combining h@xmath46 and 24@xmath1 flux .",
    "this shows that the heating source of cold dust near the star forming regions is not caused by massive ionizing stars , but the non - ionizing , evolved population of stars .",
