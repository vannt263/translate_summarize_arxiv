    "matching of the spatial components @xmath7 and @xmath8 to the same level of accuracy has now also been completed .",
    "the actions used are highly improved lattice actions .",
    "the asqtad improved naive light quark action , which is correct through @xmath9@xmath10@xmath11 was used . for the heavy quarks , we used an improved nrqcd action .",

    "two independent methods were employed for the matching calculation : first , mathematica was used to do the dirac algebra and where necessary , to take derivatives with respect to external momenta .",
