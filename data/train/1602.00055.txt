    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model successfully explains several astrophysical phenomena .",
    "these include flat galactic rotation curves , gravitational lensing , elemental abundances from big bang nucleosynthesis , and the power spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies .",
    "this consistency has led to the widespread acceptance of the @xmath0cdm paradigm , in which the universe also exhibits a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "cdm does , however , have remaining tensions with observations , especially on @xmath1 mpc scales . these include inconsistency with the observed asymptotic velocity - mass ( @xmath2 ) scaling in the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "efforts have been made to construct theories that better match observations on galactic length scales than cdm .",
    "the most prominent of these is modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite proposed by milgrom . in mond the equation of motion is @xmath3 , such that the smooth interpolating function @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , where @xmath7 with the critical acceleration @xmath8 being a tunable parameter , found to be numerically related to the speed of light @xmath9 and the hubble parameter @xmath10 as @xmath11 .",
    "a favorite interpolating function is given by @xmath12 which we will use in section 4 .",
    "for a given source mass @xmath13 , we have @xmath14 when @xmath15 , while @xmath16 when @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the usual newtonian acceleration without dark matter .",
    "it is readily shown that on the outer edges of a galaxy where gravity is weak , mond yields asymptotically flat rotation curves , and @xmath19 , the tully - fisher relation as observed .",
    "mond however struggles to reproduce observations at cluster and cosmological length scales @xcite .",
    "hence , cdm is usually preferred over mond , with efforts ongoing to reconcile cdm with observations on @xmath1 mpc scales .",
    "modified dark matter ( mdm ) @xcite is a new form of dark matter quantum that theoretically behaves like cold dark matter ( cdm ) at cluster and cosmic scales , and naturally accounts for the scaling usually associated with mond at the galactic scales .",
    "the latter feature explains why mdm was originally known as mondian dark matter @xcite ; but in view of the confusing connotation to which this nomenclature has probably given rise and in order not to distract from the fact that the model _ is _ a model of dark matter , we have settled on the name  modified dark matter \" ( to distinguish it from cold dark matter . )",
    "mdm is a phenomenlogical model inspired by quantum gravity .",
    "we recall its construction in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we provide the first observational test of mdm by fitting rotation curves to a sample of 30 local spiral galaxies ( @xmath20 ) @xcite and we show that mdm is a more economical model than cdm .",

    "in order to test mdm with galactic rotation curves , we fit computed rotation curves to a selected sample of ursa major galaxies given in ref . 10 .",

    "fits , we use the navarro , frenk & white ( nfw ) @xcite density profile , employing _",
    "three _ free parameters ( one of which is the mass - to - light ratio . ) it is fair to say that both models fit the data well ; but we remind the readers that while the mdm fits use only 1 free parameter , for the cdm fits one needs to use 3 free parameters . thus the mdm model is a more economical model than cdm in fitting data at the galactic scale .    shown in fig",
