    "milagro is a tev gamma - ray detector which uses the water cherenkov technique to detect extensive air - showers produced by very high energy ( vhe , @xmath1 100 gev ) gamma rays as they interact with the earth s atmosphere .",
    "milagro is located in the jemez mountains of northern new mexico , at an altitude of 2630 m , has a field of view of @xmath22 sr and a duty cycle greater than 90% .",
    "the effective area of milagro is a function of zenith angle and ranges from @xmath3 at 100 gev to @xmath4 at 10 tev . a sparse array of 175 4000 liter water tanks , each containing an individual pmt , was recently added .",
    "these additional detectors , known as `` outriggers '' ( figure  [ outrigger ] ) , extend the physical area of milagro to 40,000 @xmath5 , substantially increasing the sensitivity of the instrument and lowering the energy threshold .",
    "the angular resolution is approximately 0.75 degrees without the outriggers and 0.45 degrees with them .",
    "a full survey of the northern hemisphere ( declination of 1.180@xmath6 ) for point sources was carried out  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ all - sky - map ] shows the map of the northern hemisphere in tev gamma rays for the milagro data set between 15 december 2000 and 25 november 2003 .",
    "table  [ table1 ] lists all point sources with an excess greater than 4@xmath7 .",
    "the last column represents the 95% confidence upper limit on the flux , in units of the crab .",
    "the crab and mkn 421 are both clearly visible in the map , and are listed in the sixth and seventh row , respectively , of table  [ table1 ] .",
    "a square bin of @xmath8 in declination ( @xmath9 ) and [ 2.1/cos(@xmath9)]@xmath6 in right ascension was used in this analysis . to detect other possible sources of vhe emission",
    "it is necessary to survey the sky at many different timescales and at many different bin sizes .",
    "in addition to searching for steady point sources of tev gamma rays , milagro has searched for short bursts of tev gamma rays  @xcite , for tev emission from the direction of satellite detected grbs  @xcite , and for extended sources of tev emission  @xcite , as we summarize in this paper .",
    ".locations of all regions with an excess greater than 4@xmath7 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]          the second extended source candidate is coincident with the region known as the cygnus arm , a spiral arm within our galaxy that extends radially away from observers on earth .",
    "this region is known to be a dense region of gas and dust and was observed by egret as the brightest source of gev gamma rays in the northern sky , with a diffuse gev emission comparable to the galactic bulge . like the emission from the galactic plane region , vhe emission from the cygnus arm is thought to originate mainly from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas and dust .",
    "a 5.5 sigma excess was detected using a 5.9 degree bin , at ra=308 degrees and dec=42 degrees .",
    "the probability of observing an excess this significant at any point in the sky at any bin size is 2.0% .",
    "figure  [ cygnus_region ] shows the significance of the region of the sky containing the cygnus arm , showing also the galactic plane from l=20 degrees to l=100 degrees and b=+/- 5 degrees superimposed on the plot .",
    "the excess observed by milagro is inconsistent with a point source and the number of events coming from the entire 5.9@xmath6 bin is approximately twice that of the crab .",
    "like in the case of 3eg j0520 + 2556 , the accumulation of the excess is steady , and no evidence for flaring is observed . while this is an extremely bright region , making it the hottest spot in the galactic plane , it is not surprising that it has not been detected yet by any of the atmospheric cerenkov telescopes , given the diffuse nature of the source , and the limited field of view of such telescopes .",
    "milagro has detected three previously unknown diffuse sources of tev gamma rays .",
    "milagro has reported the first observation of diffuse tev emission from the galactic plane .",
    "in addition to this , two other diffuse sources have been detected .",
    "the first , coincident with 3eg j0520 + 2556 , and the second coincident with the cygnus arm , at 5.9 and 5.5 sigma respectively .",
    "when all trials of the all - sky search are considered , the probabilities of these excesses being due to background fluctuations are 0.8% and 2.0% respectively . the source coincident with 3eg j0520 + 2556",
    "was previously reported by milagro as a `` hot spot '' .",
    "many people helped bring milagro to fruition .",
    "in particular , we acknowledge the efforts of scott delay , neil thompson and michael schneider . this work has been supported by the national science foundation ( under grants phy-0075326 , -0096256 , -0097315 , -0206656 , -0245143 , -0245234 , -0302000 , and atm-0002744 ) the us department of energy ( office of high - energy physics and office of nuclear physics ) , los alamos national laboratory , the university of california , and the institute of geophysics and planetary physics .",
