    "superconducting systems are among the most likely candidates for the implementation of quantum information processing applications @xcite . in order to perform multi - qubit operations",
    ", one needs a reliable method for switchable coupling between the qubits , i.e. a coupling mechanism that can be easily turned on and off . over the past few years",
    ", there have been several theoretical proposals to achieve that goal @xcite , and initial experimental advances have been made @xcite .",
    "the early proposals involved performing fast changes in the qubit parameters and taking the qubits out of their so - called optimal points @xcite or using additional circuit elements @xcite .",
    "both approaches increase the complexity of the experimental setup and add noise to the system .",
    "@xcite proposed a switchable coupling mechanism that is turned on by applying resonant oscillating fields to the qubits and employing ideas inspired by the double - resonance physics known from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite . in their proposal the qubits are kept at their optimal points throughout the experiment , neglecting the oscillating deviations caused by the driving fields . in spite of its appealing minimal reliance on additional circuit elements , that proposal requires the application of large driving fields .",
    "other authors later proposed alternative mechanisms that avoided that limitation while still using oscillating fields or oscillating circuit parameters to induce inter - qubit coupling @xcite .",
    "those most recent proposals , however , suffer from some limitations of their own , e.g. not being usable at the optimal point @xcite or requiring additional circuit elements @xcite .    here",
    "we propose a generalized version of the double - resonance method where the constraint on the driving amplitudes is substantially milder than that required for the proposal of ref .",
    "our proposal provides an alternative to experimentalists when deciding what is the most suitable coupling mechanism to use in their experimental setup .",
    "it is worth noting from the outset that the term double resonance could be somewhat misleading in this context , since the mechanism discussed below requires only one resonance criterion , namely the one given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) .",
    "however , we use it following similar mechanisms in the context of nmr @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the model system and review recent proposals for achieving switchable coupling . in sec .",
    "iii we derive our proposed coupling mechanism and consider some aspects of its operation . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the possible application of the proposal to realistic experimental setups that use inductively coupled flux qubits or capacitively coupled phase qubits .",
    "we conclude the discussion in sec . v.",
    "we start by describing the system in general terms , and we defer the discussion of its physical implementation to sec .",
    "the system that we consider is composed of two qubits with fixed bias and interaction parameters .",
    "oscillating external fields can then be applied to the system in order to perform the different gate operations . in other words",
    ", we consider the same system that was considered in ref .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the system is given by : @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the energy splitting between the two states of the qubit labelled with the index @xmath2 ; @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are , respectively , the amplitude , frequency and phase of the applied oscillating fields , @xmath6 is the inter - qubit coupling strength , and @xmath7 are the pauli matrices with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath10 are denoted by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with @xmath13 .",
    "note that we shall set @xmath14 throughout this paper .    in order for the qubits to be effectively decoupled in the absence of driving by the oscillating fields ,",
    "we take @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , and we have assumed , with no loss of generality , that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that the absence of terms of the form @xmath19 is also crucial to ensure effective decoupling .",
    "let us also take @xmath20 , where @xmath21 represents the typical size of the parameters @xmath1 .",
    "since we will generally assume driving amplitudes @xmath3 comparable to @xmath22 , the above condition will be crucial in neglecting the fast - rotating terms below , i.e. in making the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "single - qubit operations can be performed straightforwardly by a combination of letting the qubit state evolve freely , i.e. with @xmath23 , and irradiating it at its resonance frequency , i.e. taking @xmath24 . under the effect of resonant irradiation ,",
    "rabi oscillations in the state of the qubit occur with frequency @xmath3 .",
    "although a clear review of previous proposals is not possible without a detailed discussion , we summarize the ideas of those proposals briefly here . the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite involves irradiating each of the two interacting qubits on resonance , i.e. taking @xmath24 , and relies on one manifestation of double resonance @xcite .",
    "the idea of the double resonance in that case is that not only is each qubit driven resonantly , but also the sum of the rabi frequencies of the two qubits matches the difference between their characteristic frequencies ( i.e. @xmath25 ) . after making two rotating - frame transformations and neglecting fast - rotating terms , i.e. performing two rwas",
    ", one finds that the inter - qubit coupling term is no longer effectively turned off ( note that those transformations are essentially a special case of the ones we shall give in sec .",
    "one thus achieves switchable coupling between the qubits .",
    "that proposal was criticized , however , for requiring such large rabi frequencies .",
    "the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite uses an external field applied to one qubit at the sum of or difference between the characteristic frequencies of the two qubits in order to perform gate operations ( e.g. @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) . however , since all the relevant matrix elements , e.g. @xmath28 , with the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) vanish , the proposed method would not drive the intended transitions .",
    "one therefore needs to use a somewhat modified hamiltonian , e.g. one that contains an additional single - qubit static term with a @xmath29 operator . in practice , that means biasing one of the qubits away from its optimal point in the case of charge or flux qubits . since optimal - point operation",
    "is highly desirable in order to minimize decoherence , an alternative mechanism was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in those proposals an additional circuit element that can mediate coupling between the qubits",
    "is added to the circuit design . that addition effectively makes the parameter @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) tunable , with its value depending on the bias parameters of the additional circuit element .",
    "one of those parameters is then modulated at a frequency that matches either the sum of or difference between the characteristic qubit frequencies .",
    "clearly , since the driving term contains the operator @xmath30 , it can drive oscillations in the transition @xmath31 or @xmath32 , even when both qubits are operated at their optimal points . as mentioned above",
    ", however , the use of additional circuit elements is undesirable , because of the increased circuit complexity and decoherence .    in the next section",
    ", we shall derive our proposal to couple the qubits by applying two external fields close to resonance with the interacting pair of qubits such that neither qubit is driven resonantly , but the sum of the ( nonresonant ) rabi frequencies satisfies the double - resonance condition .",
    "therefore , in some sense we relax the requirement that the driving amplitudes must be as large as @xmath33 , as is the case in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we make up for the resulting loss of frequency by adding the qubit - field frequency detuning to the double - resonance condition .",
    "we now turn to the main proposal of this paper , namely driving oscillations between the states @xmath34 and @xmath35 by employing double resonance with non - resonant oscillating fields .",
    "we take the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and transform it as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 a solution of the schrdinger equation @xmath38 can then be expressed as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 satisfies the equation @xmath41 . to simplify the following algebra",
    ", we take @xmath42 . neglecting terms that oscillate with frequency of the order of @xmath1 , we find that @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "we now make a basis transformation in spin space from the operators @xmath46 to the operators @xmath47 such that the time - independent terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hprime ] ) are parallel to the new @xmath48-axis and the @xmath49-axis is not affected .",
    "equation ( [ eq : hprime ] ) can then be re - expressed as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , the angles @xmath52 are defined by the criterion @xmath53 , and @xmath54 contains terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hprime ] ) that were not written out explicitly in eq . ( [ eq : hprimetransformed ] ) because they will soon be neglected .",
    "we now take the frequencies to match the criterion @xmath55 , or more explicitly @xmath56 where , as mentioned above , @xmath44 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we also take the two terms on the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) to be comparable to one another . taking the above condition allows us to simplify @xmath57 with one more transformation . using a similar procedure to that we used above for the first transformation",
    ", we now take @xmath58 and after neglecting terms that oscillate with frequency of order @xmath22 we find that @xmath59 the reason why we can neglect the term @xmath54 in the above transformation can be seen by observing that all the terms contained in @xmath54 contain at least one @xmath60 operator , and they oscillate with frequency @xmath61 . therefore , even after the transformation , those terms will still oscillate with frequencies that are of the order of @xmath22 ( and amplitudes smaller than @xmath6 ) , meaning that their effects on the dynamics can be neglected in @xmath62 , whose typical energy scale is a fraction of @xmath6 .",
    "equations ( [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) and ( [ eq : hdoubleprime ] ) form the basis for the coupling mechanism that we propose in this paper .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath62 drives the transition @xmath31 but does not affect the states @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the basis of the operators @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , a single two - qubit gate that can be performed using the hamiltonian @xmath62 and the set of all single - qubit transformations form a universal set of gates for quantum computing . note that since the two - qubit gate is performed in the basis of the @xmath47 matrices rather than the @xmath46 matrices , one needs to include in the pulse sequence the appropriate single - qubit operations before and after the two - qubit gate .",
    "note also that if we take the special case @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 , we recover the corresponding case in the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    a first look at eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdoubleprime ] ) shows that one can achieve faster gate operation than in the special case @xmath65 by choosing @xmath67 to be negative and @xmath68 to be positive . in other words , instead of using the special case of resonant driving ( @xmath66 )",
    "one chooses @xmath69 to be negative and @xmath70 to be positive ( i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) while noting that latexmath:[$\\sqrt{\\delta\\omega_j^2+\\omega_j^2 } <    at least one of the frequencies @xmath3 above the value @xmath33 in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) with that choice of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since we started with the motivation of finding an alternative double - resonance method that works with smaller values of @xmath3 , we focus on the opposite case , namely @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and we accept the resulting reduction in gate operation speed . starting from the special case @xmath66 and moving in the direction given above , we find that both @xmath76s can now be reduced below the value @xmath33 while satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) .",
    "it is worth pausing here to comment on the higher - order effects that we have neglected in making the two rwas .",
    "the second - order shifts that we have neglected in making our first rwa , i.e. the bloch - siegert shifts , are of order @xmath77 @xcite . that energy scale is not obviously smaller than the inter - qubit coupling strength @xmath6 .",
    "one might therefore suspect that those shifts will prohibit the performance of the proposed method .",
    "that is not the case , however , since those shifts only modify the values of the required driving frequencies and amplitudes , as we shall demonstrate with numerical simulations in sec .",
    "we shall take the case where @xmath78 , and we shall show that full oscillations between the states @xmath34 and @xmath35 can still be obtained when the shifts are properly taken into account .",
    "other frequency shifts that result from our approximations , and possibly other experiment - specific shifts , also affect the required driving frequencies and amplitudes .",
    "we will not attempt to give analytic expressions for those shifts .",
    "however , we will take them into account by numerically scanning the driving amplitudes to achieve optimal gate operation .",
    "we now ask the question of how low can @xmath3 be chosen to be . in principle , eq . ( [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) can still be satisfied by taking @xmath3 to be very small and taking @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "note , however , that the frequency of gate operations is given by the coefficient in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hdoubleprime ] ) , namely @xmath81 .",
    "that coefficient therefore determines the width of the resonance , or in other words , the error tolerance in driving amplitudes from the resonance criterion ( eq . [ eq : doubleresonancecriterion ] ) @xcite .",
    "one is therefore restricted to using values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 such that the above coefficient is larger than the accuracy of the available pulse generators .",
    "furthermore , taking the inverse of the frequency determines the period of oscillations in the doubly rotating frame , or in other words , the time required to perform a two - qubit gate operation .",
    "since the decoherence time sets an upper limit on how slowly one can perform the gate operations , that consideration provides another restriction on the allowed values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "an experimentalist must therefore take the two above considerations into account , along with any restriction they have on the maximum usable driving amplitudes , in order to determine the window of parameters where the coupling mechanism can be realized .",
    "the parameters can then be fine - tuned within that window for optimal results .    as an added perspective to help visualize the resonance criterion , we show in fig .  1 the relevant energy - level structure .",
    "one can compare this figure to fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that case",
    ", the on - resonance rabi frequencies provide all of the energy splitting ( i.e. @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) required to satisfy the resonance criterion . in the present case ,",
    "the energy levels involved in the frequency matching are already brought closer to each other by the facts that ( 1 ) the difference @xmath86 is smaller than the difference @xmath87 and ( 2 ) the detuning of each driving field from its corresponding qubit brings the relevant levels even closer to each other .",
    "it would appear from fig .",
    "1 that the resonance criterion can be satisfied with arbitrarily small driving amplitudes and the proper choice of @xmath88 and @xmath89 . as was discussed above , however , the matrix element ( in the dressed - state picture ) coupling the relevant energy levels becomes very small in that case , leading to the undesirable situation of high required accuracy in the driving fields and slow gate operation .",
    ".,width=302 ]    we reiterate that care must be taken in using the term double resonance in describing the coupling mechanism discussed above .",
    "however , since it seems that the term is used to describe a number of distinct phenomena in nmr @xcite , some of which bear resemblance to the one discussed here , we have followed that broad definition of the term .",
    "note , in particular , that the mechanism discussed above requires only one resonance condition , namely the one given in eq .",

    "the interaction is mediated by the mutual inductance @xmath92 between the two qubit loops.,width=264 ]    in the above discussion , we have not specified what kind of qubits we consider .",
    "our results therefore apply to any kind of qubit where the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) describes the two - qubit system . because of its relevance to current experimental attempts to achieve switchable coupling between superconducting qubits ,",
    "we now focus on the case of two inductively coupled flux qubits , as shown in fig .  2 @xcite . since the truncation of the full hamiltonian to the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) has already been discussed by several authors ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and it is not central to our discussion , we do not include it here .    in experiments on flux qubits ,",
    "the individual qubits typically have @xmath93 ghz ( note that the exact value is not completely controllable during fabrication , with the uncertainty reaching 0.5 - 1 ghz in some experiments ) @xcite .",
    "the inter - qubit coupling strength @xmath6 can be taken to be around @xmath94 ghz .",
    "the highest achievable on - resonance rabi frequencies @xmath3 are in the range of several hundred mhz to 1 ghz ( times @xmath95 ) .",
    "the achievable rabi frequencies are therefore large enough when compared with the naturally ( i.e. , uncontrollably ) occurring inter - qubit detuning @xmath22 , suggesting that it might be possible to implement the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite with the above qubit design .",
    "however , additional difficulties that we have not discussed in sec .",
    "iii arise in different experimental setups .",
    "one experimental difficulty arises when @xmath22 is 0.5 - 1 ghz @xcite . in that case , the required rabi frequencies are large enough to excite higher states outside the truncated qubit basis , in addition to exciting other modes in the circuit .",
    "one would therefore ideally want to avoid using the highest values of @xmath3 cited above ( @xmath96 0.5 ghz ) . taking intermediate values of @xmath97 between 0 and 1 ,",
    "the required rabi frequencies can be reduced substantially , and the two - qubit gate operation can still be performed in a time of the order of a few hundred nanoseconds . that time scale is smaller than the qubit decoherence times ( typically 1 - 3 @xmath98s ) , which means that a simple two - qubit quantum gate operation could be observable in the near future .",
    "clearly , an increase in the decoherence times would be highly desirable in order to achieve longer sequences of gate operations .    , @xmath34 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",

    "the simulations are performed by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "we therefore make the two - level system approximation in describing each qubit .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "if we take realistic experimental parameters and @xmath107 , which corresponds to a reduction in the required driving amplitudes by a factor of about two , and we take the qubit to be initially in the state @xmath34 , we can see that the occupation probability oscillates between the states @xmath34 and @xmath35 with negligible errors and a very reasonable oscillation period ( note that since we are considering a simple experiment designed to provide a proof - of - principle demonstration of switchable coupling , errors of the order of 1% are negligible ) . in fig .",

    "the hamiltonian describing the system includes additional terms of the form @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , and the coefficient @xmath113 quantifies the amount of crosstalk .",
    "if the amplitudes of the applied fields are small , a microwave signal that is resonant with one qubit will not affect the other qubit . however ,",
    "if the rabi frequencies are comparable to the inter - qubit detuning , e.g. when @xmath114 and @xmath115 , crosstalk can not be neglected . in our method the ratio @xmath116 is equal to @xmath117 , suggesting that the harmful effects of crosstalk could be reduced by decreasing @xmath118 .",

    "the period of oscillations in fig .",
    "4(b ) is about 100 ns , suggesting that an experimental demonstration of the coupling should be possible even in the presence of 100% crosstalk .",
    "finally , let us make a few remarks about the possible implementation of our method to capacitively coupled phase qubits @xcite .",
    "it is perhaps clearest to start by noting a point that is not directly related to the procedure of implementing our proposal : one of the main considerations in charge and flux qubits , namely the question of optimal - point operation , is rather irrelevant to the study of phase qubits , at least in the usual sense of using eigenstates with special symmetries to minimize decoherence .",
    "the phase qubit is simply a single josephson junction controlled by a bias current .",
    "the static part of the bias current determines the qubit splittings @xmath1 , whereas the amplitude of the oscillating part of the bias current determines the rabi frequencies @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "if one now takes two capacitively coupled phase qubits , one finds that the coupling term has the form @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "if we now take the phases of the oscillating fields @xmath120 , we can follow the derivation of sec .",
    "iii and obtain the same results . in phase",
    "qubits the qubit splittings @xmath1 are typically a few ghz ( times @xmath95 ) , and unlike flux qubits those splittings can be tuned using the bias current during the experiment .",
    "rabi frequencies can reach a few hundred mhz , and the coupling strength can be taken to be @xmath121 0.1 ghz , giving essentially the same values for the parameters as discussed above for flux qubits .",
    "we finally note that the driving fields are supplied through the bias current rather than through external fields , which means that crosstalk is not a problem with phase qubits .",
    "realization of our proposal , or even that of ref .",
    "@xcite , should therefore be possible with capacitively coupled phase qubits .",
    "we have derived a generalized double - resonance method for switchable coupling between qubits .",
    "the qubits are driven close to resonance such that the sum of their rabi frequencies is equal to the difference between the frequencies of the driving fields .",

    "<S> the deviation from resonance relaxes the criterion of strong driving fields while still allowing for a fully entangling two - qubit gate . </S>",
    "<S> this method avoids some of the shortcomings of previous proposals for switchable coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible application of our proposal to a pair of inductively coupled flux qubits , and we consider the extension to phase qubits . </S>"
