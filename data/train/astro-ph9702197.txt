    "bl lac objects are discovered mostly through x - ray or radio surveys .",
    "the existing complete samples therefore are either x - ray @xcite or radio flux - limited samples @xcite and bl lac objects are classified as xbl ( x - ray selected ) or rbl ( radio selected ) depending on the method of discovery .",
    "the @xmath1 spectra of rbls peak somewhere in the far - infrared and have a higher peak luminosity than the xbls that usually peak in the uv - soft x - ray range ( @xcite @xcite , hereafter smu96 ) . according to a recently proposed scheme @xcite , bl lac objects are classified as high peak frequency bl lac objects ( hbl ) or low peak frequency bl lac objects ( lbl ) , depending on the value of the x - ray to radio - flux ratio .",
    "most of the hbls are xbls and most of the lbls are rbls .",
    "although this classification scheme reflects more closely the observed properties of the bl lac objects , it inherits the dichotomization that was imposed by the two different discovery methods .",
    "if the two methods of discovery force us to observe the two extremes of a continuous distribution , thereby introducing a selection induced bimodality , the question that arises is whether there is an observed quantity that varies in a continuous fashion , has a well defined physical significance , and can be used as a classifying parameter .",
    "recently smu96 examined the multifrequency spectral properties of three complete samples of blazars , the _ einstein extended medium sensitivity survey sample of xbls @xcite , the @xmath4 jy sample of rbls @xcite , and a small complete sample of fsrq from the s5 survey @xcite . if we consider the bl lac samples collectively ( fig . [ data ] ) we notice that in all six diagrams there is an upper envelope separating the populated area from a well defined zone of avoidance . for a given peak frequency @xmath0",
    "there is a permitted range of luminosities and spectral indices .",
    "as @xmath0 increases the maximum observed luminosity decreases , the steepest observed spectral index flattens , and the maximum observed concavity index @xmath5 decreases .",
    "the flattest spectral indices and the most negative concavity indices do not seem to be very sensitive functions of @xmath0 .",
    "_    _ we propose a continuous classification system for bl lac objects , based on the peak frequency @xmath0 of the @xmath1 synchrotron luminosity distribution .",
    "a bl lac object is classified according to its peak frequency @xmath0 .",
    "for example , a bl lac object peaking at @xmath6 will be classified as a _",
    "bl14 object .",
    "_ _    the peak frequency of a bl lacertae object is a very important parameter from a physical point of view .",
    "energetically , it is the most important frequency for the observed synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is closely related to the peak of the inverse compton emission in both the synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) @xcite and the external compton ( ec ) models @xcite .",
    "it is linked to the energetics and geometry of the synchrotron source and to the angle formed between the observer and the plasma bulk velocity , if the source is moving relativistically ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "as smu96 pointed out the accurate determination of @xmath0 requires contemporaneous flux measurements in different wavelength regimes",
    ". the contribution of new telescopes such as iso towards this goal can be particularly important .",
    "orientation and physical differences have been evoked to explain the range of the observed properties of bl lac objects ( smu96 ; @xcite @xcite ) . under the proposed taxonomical scheme",
    "the problem of the xbl - rbl differences can be restated as follows : _ what is changing as we continuously shift from a bl13 to a bl17 object ? _    recently , @xcite used the accelerating inner jet model to argue that , although the mean properties of xbl and rbl samples can be explained under the orientation - determined scenario , the sources seem to be additionally characterized by a range of physical parameters .",
    "it seems therefore necessary to invoke the scaling of an appropriate physical quantity that would preserve the observed self - similarity of the relativistic jets from the galactic to the extragalactic scale .",
    "an observed physical parameter that is known to vary over several decades in relativistic jets and over almost three decades in bl lac objects is the synchrotron peak luminosity @xmath8 .",
    "a plausible way to explain this range of @xmath8 is to associate it with an intrinsic range of the relativistic electron kinetic luminosity @xmath3 . in a scale invariant description of the jet",
    ", the luminosity relates to the jet radius according to the relation @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "preliminary results ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) show that a combination of a range of electron kinetic luminosities @xmath3 and jet orientation angles @xmath2 covers a major part of the observed @xmath10 space .",
    "it is very encouraging that this can be achieved only through variation of aspect and jet power .",
    "we are continuing our work by comparing the predicted and observed properties of bl lac objects as well as by incorporating the flat spectrum radio quasars in the above scheme .",
