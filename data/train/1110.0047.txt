    "from these analyses it was discovered that for three observations between 2003 march and 2004 february , the column density of cold material along the line of sight to the nucleus increased by @xmath060% , from 16 @xmath1@xmath2 to 26 @xmath1@xmath2 . from this",

    "there was a clear temporary increase in this ratio between mjd 55440 and 55600 that can be inferred to be a temporary increase in @xmath9caused by a cloud or clump of material passing through the line of sight to the nucleus . to confirm this we performed time - resolved spectral fitting .",
    "all spectral fitting for this analysis was done using xspec version 12.5.1k with cross - sections from verner et al .",

    "fitting clump geometries to the time resolved @xmath9values was performed in idl version 6.3 .",

    "this method was appropriate for our analysis since the normal method tends to overestimate errors due to the background modeling for short observations such as ours .",
    "we analyzed pca spectra in 10 day intervals with total exposures of 36 ks .",
    "we included data from 330 kev in all time bins .",
    "our base model consisted of a power law with a fixed galactic absorption column of 8.09 @xmath20@xmath2 ( kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) , an additional cold absorber with a free column density , and an fe line modeled with a gaussian .",
    "results from this fitting are shown in figure [ fignh ] and example spectra with models and best - fit residuals are shown in figure [ figspec ] .",
    "reduced @xmath21 values were close to 1 in all cases .",

    "the average column density in the 7 months preceding this event was 20.9 @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the photon index values were consistent with a constant @xmath22 through this 16 month period .",
    "fe line parameters ( which are not shown here ) were poorly constrained but showed no evidence for strong variability .",
    "we tried applying the cabs model to test whether the slight fluctuations in the unabsorbed 210 kev flux were due to extra scattering by the increased amount of material in the line of sight .",
    "this model is more commonly used for compton - thick sources to model the attenuation of the power law by scattering , however since the changes in @xmath9were less than @xmath23@xmath2 , including this model did not affect the relative magnitude of the fluctuations and we did not use it in our final analysis .",
    "we tested three density profiles for the increase in @xmath9above a constant baseline which was left free : a sphere of uniform density ; a @xmath24 profile as used by lamer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) to fit a similar occultation observed in ngc  3227 given by the equation ,    @xmath25    where r@xmath26 is the core radius ( dapp & basu 2009 ) ; and a linear - density sphere with a maximum central density and a density profile described by the equation ,    @xmath27    where r is the outer radius of the spherical clump .",
    "figure [ fignhfit ] shows the data , models and fit residuals for all three models .",
    "the linear - density sphere gave the best fit with @xmath21/dof = 73/43 .",
    "the @xmath24 model gave @xmath21/dof = 96/43 and the uniform sphere gave an unacceptable fit with @xmath21/dof = 160/43 .",
    "for the linear - density sphere we found that the occultation lasted a total of 170 days with a maximum column density of 8.4 @xmath1@xmath2 above a baseline of 20.9 @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "the core radius crossing time ( fwhm ) for the @xmath24 model was 60 days with a maximum column density of 10.3 @xmath28@xmath2 above a constant baseline level of absorption of 19.0 @xmath28@xmath2 . for analysis of the physical attributes of the clump based on these models see section 3 .",
    "we also tested for cometary tails as seen by maiolino et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , testing for asymmetry in the ingress and egress durations , however these did not improve the fit . from visual inspection it is clear that the cen  aoccultation is fairly symmetrical with a smooth , gradual increase and decrease in the column density whereas a comet - like shape would be appropriate for a rapid increase and slow decrease .",
    "consequently , this model is inappropriate for this source .",
    "of the other agn with similar short term increases or decreases in @xmath9 , many have posited that these clouds are part of the blr rather than constituents of the torus .",
    "the low density of the clumps observed in cen  acombined with the lack of detected broad lines in this source ( alexander et al .",
    "1999 ) make this a very unlikely scenario .",
    "therefore we conclude that the transiting clump(s ) that have been seen in this source must arise from the dusty torus .    the clumpy torus model of nenkova ( nenkova et al .",
    "2008a ; nenkova et al .",
    "2008b ) predicts a small number of clumps along the line of sight to the nucleus making up the total observed column density .",
    "this is borne out in our observation .",
    "the ratio of the baseline column density to the average increase caused by the clump is @xmath11 5 .",
    "we can therefore assume that the number of clouds along the line of sight is @xmath15 5 since some of the baseline absorption column may be dust free and reside inside the inner radius of the dusty torus . for example , the very short transits seen by risaliti et al .  (",
    "2009 ) must come from inside the dust sublimation radius . assuming a viewing angle to the equatorial plane of 62.@xmath136 and an angular distribution of clouds of 60@xmath13 ( ramos almeida et al .",
    "2009 ) we calculate that the average number of clouds along an equatorial ray is @xmath15 14 .",
    "this is consistent with rothschild et al .",
    "( 2011 ) as well as the predicted number of clumps from nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008b ) which is no more than 1015 clumps along an equatorial ray .    assuming that all of these clouds have an average column density of 4",
    "@xmath1@xmath2this would imply a total column density along the equator of @xmath06 @xmath29@xmath2 which is just on the verge of being compton - thick .",
    "this is reasonable given that no compton reflection signal has ever been detected in this source .",
    "the distance of the dusty torus in cen  afrom the central illuminating source derived from infrared measurements by meisenheimer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) was 0.10.3 pc .",
    "nenkova et al .",
    "( 2008b ) calculated an inner dust sublimation radius of 0.04 pc .",
    "we can place limits on the radius of the torus by following the calculations of lamer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) which use the information that the obscuring material is completely cold with an ionization parameter @xmath301 and assuming keplerian motion .",
    "their equation ( 3 ) gives a relationship between the radius of the material and the ionizing luminosity ( @xmath31 ) of the source :      where @xmath33 is the mass of the black hole which has been measured at m@xmath34 @xmath35(cappellari et al .",

    "we adopt an inner radius of 0.1 pc and an outer radius of 0.3 pc .    using parameters determined by the linear - density sphere model ( this model gives a better fit to the data than the other models , though it is a purely empirical model )",

    "the best fit model with residuals is shown in figure [ figrlin ] ; notice that with only three data points we needed to assume the baseline column density rather than leave it as a free parameter as we did with the more recent event . for this baseline",
