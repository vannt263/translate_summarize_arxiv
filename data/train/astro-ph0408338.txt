    "were we to choose at random a hundred members of the iau and ask each of them to tell us the value of the hubble constant and how it is measured , few if any would refer to gravitational lens time delay measurements .",
    "most would instead refer to observations of cepheid variables with hst or to observations of the cmb power spectrum with wmap .",
    "these set the _ de facto _ standard against which time delay estimates must be evaluated .",
    "the cepheids give a hubble constant of @xmath0 km / s / mpc with a 10% uncertainty ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( freedman et al . 2001 ) ) , a result that most of our randomly chosen astronomers would find relatively straightforward .",
    "but only a handful of them would be able to tell us how the cmb power spectrum yields a measurement of the hubble constant .    in his opening",
    "talk , david spergel told us that three numbers are determined to high accuracy by the cmb power spectrum : the height of the first peak , the contrast between the heights of the even and odd peaks , and the distance between peaks .",
    "ask anyone who calls himself a cosmologist how many free parameters his world model has and the number @xmath1 will be larger than three .",
    "spergel s three numbers constrain combinations of those @xmath1 parameters , but do not , in particular , tightly constrain the hubble constant .",
    "one must supplement the cmb either with observations , or alternatively , with non - observational constraints .",
    "the effects of supplementing the observed cmb power spectrum with other observations , and of adopting ( or declining to adopt ) non - observational constraints , are shown in table 1 .",
    "all of the numbers shown are taken from the analysis by @xcite .",
    "they use the first year data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( bennett et al . 2003 ) ) , the second data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( abazajian et al . 2004 ) ) , the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tonry et al . ( 2003 ) ) , data for high redshift type ia supernovae , and data from 6 other cmb experiments : boomerang , dasi , maxima , vsa , cbi and acbar .",
    ".the cmb power spectrum and the hubble constant [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     but if the group is isothermal , it has a convergence associated with it  in this case approximately 10% .",
    "this decreases the predicted time delay by 10% .",
    "small numbers make measurement of the actual velocity dispersion difficult , but it is consistent ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( tonry 1998 ) ) with the tidal estimate .",
    "many of the quadruple lenses live in groups and clusters with convergences at the position of the lens of 10 , 20 and even 30% .",
    "the corrections are substantial , and we must wonder whether we have got the cluster convergence correct .",
    "two of the systems in figure  [ fig : courbin ] , q0957 + 561 and rxj0911 + 0554 , have inferred convergences in the 20 - 30% range .",
    "this is a manifestation of a difficulty more generally known as the mass sheet degeneracy ( ( * ? ?",
    "* gorenstein , shapiro , & falco 1988 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* saha 2000 ) ) .",
    "there is no way of knowing ( from deflections and distortions ) whether or not a mass sheet is present , but it affects the predicted time delays by changing the mean convergence .",
    "equations [ taukappa ] and [ rhoeta ] tell us that the interpretation of the time delay for pg1115 + 080 depends crucially upon the internal structure of the galaxy .",
    "an error in the radial exponent of plus or minus 0.1 produces a 10% change in the predicted time delay as compared to an isothermal model . fortunately we can test the isothermality hypothesis . for an isothermal sphere ,",
    "the angular radius of the einstein ring , @xmath2 , is a directly proportional to the square of the velocity dispersion , @xmath3 : @xmath4 with an einstein ring radius @xmath5 , a lens redshift @xmath6 and a source redshift @xmath7 we predict @xmath8 km / s .",
    "this must be reduced by a factor @xmath9 which amounts to a 5% correction in the present case .",
    "we can test our prediction , but the measurement is a difficult one .",
    "the lensing galaxy is crowded by four very much brighter images .",
    "@xcite measures a velocity dispersion of @xmath10 km / s , very much larger than predicted .",
    "@xcite use tonry s measurement in modeling pg1115 + 080 and derive a value for @xmath11 very much larger than under the isothermal hypothesis .",
    "their value is the one plotted in figure  [ fig : courbin ] .    why are we so reluctant to abandon the isothermal hypothesis for pg1115 + 080 ?",
    "first , because velocity dispersion estimates from equation [ impliedsigma ] for an ensemble of lensing galaxies are consistent with the fundamental plane relation for non - lensing ellipticals . pg1115 + 080 is in no way unusual ( * ? ? ? * ( kochanek et al . 2000 ) ) , but would be if we adopted the direct measurement .",
    "a second argument is that the lenses for which we _ can _ measure the radial exponent are very nearly isothermal .",
    "lenses with multiple sources , rings or central images all break the central concentration degeneracy and permit measurement of the radial exponent @xmath12 .",
    "the results for six systems are shown in table  [ tab : exponents ] ( see also wayth s contribution to the present proceedings ) . while there are differences in the way @xmath12 was calculated for each of these systems , the results are consistent with isothermal .",
    "unfortunately only one of these systems , jvas0218 + 357 , is also a system that has a measured time delay .",
    "a third argument is that a great many nearby galaxies have been studied , and their potentials are consistent with isothermals .",
    "this is nicely shown in a figure published by @xcite .",
    "for a sample of twenty bright ellipticals , the circular velocity inferred from the velocity dispersion declines only slightly over a factor of 30 in radius .",
    "the corresponding decline in pg1115 + 080 , computed from its measured central dispersion and the einstein ring radius , is very much larger .",
    "it is nonetheless true that the potentials for nearby ellipticals are only very - nearly isothermal and not perfectly isothermal .",
    "the central concentration degeneracy qualifies as another major difficulty associated with time delay estimates of @xmath11 .",
    "another problem associated with modeling lensing galaxies is illustrated by the system he0230 - 2130 .",
    "there is not one lensing galaxy , but two , as seen in figure  [ fig : he0230 ] .",
    "the second , fainter galaxy provides the quadrupole moment that makes this a 4-image system and not a 2-image system .",
    "when we see two galaxies separated by only a few kpc , we must wonder how the non - baryonic matter is distributed .",
    "are the halos for the two galaxies distinct ? or have they merged ? how many components should we model ? and where should their centers be ?",
    "in such a case something with elements of the @xcite form - free approach might be preferable to a straightforward parameterized model .",
    "the system with the best time delays is class1608 + 656 .",
    "@xcite have measured four beautiful radio lightcurves .",
    "all four time series faithfully reproduce the many bumps and wiggles .",
    "the multiple delays in this case are good enough to provide meaningful additional constraints to the deflections and distortions . but",
    "modeling the system is not straightforward . as with he0230 - 2130 , there are two lensing galaxies ( figure  [ fig : q1608 ] ) that appear to be interacting .",
    "a dust lane encircles them both . again",
    "the question of how the dark matter might be distributed looms as crucial .",
    "@xcite have worked exceedingly hard to constrain this system , measuring positions for the images , the shape of the ring , and measuring the velocity dispersion of the more massive lens .",
    "we can nonetheless imagine a devil s advocate coming up with a plausible dark matter distribution uncorrelated with the observed galaxies that gives a very different value for the hubble constant",
    ".    the problem of multiple lenses can be serious even when one of the galaxies is very much smaller than the principal lens .",
    "consider the case of rxj0911 + 0554 , shown in figure  [ fig : rxj0911 ] , where the primary lensing galaxy has a faint companion .",
    "given its faintness and our aversion to adding additional parameters , we might be tempted to ignore it , as did @xcite in the model used by courbin to construct figure  [ fig : courbin ] .",
    "but allowing for a mass at the position of this dwarf companion changes the predicted time delay by 10% . though the smaller galaxy is a factor of 10 fainter than the primary lensing galaxy , its effect is to move the center of mass closer to the midpoint of the images , decreasing the differences in path length .",
    "there is an irony here in that the multiple lenses work to our advantage in producing ( or adding to ) the quadrupole moments that give us 4 images rather than 2 .",
    "but at the same time they make modeling considerably more difficult .      in his contribution to the present proceedings",
    ", lutz wisotzki presents spectroscopic evidence for microlensing of quasars .",
    "this has important consequences ( unfortunately negative ) for time delay estimates of @xmath11 .",
    "it means that there are uncorrelated variations in the fluxes of images , especially in the optical continuum .",
    "the timescale for these fluctuations depends upon the size of the einstein ring of the microlenses and upon the relative velocity of the quasar and the lensing galaxy .",
    "taking the lenses to be a solar mass and the relevant velocities to be of order 300 km / s gives timescales of order 10 - 30 years .",
    "this ought not to matter for quasars lensed by galaxies , whose time delays are at most one year .",
    "but there have been repeated instances of uncorrelated variations in quasar lightcurves on considerably shorter timescales ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* burud et al . 2000 ) ) , in some cases causing considerable dispute about which points ought and ought not to be included in a time delay measurement and about the nature of the fluctuations .",
    "seven years ago the present author prevailed upon andrzej udalski to monitor he1104 - 1805 for a time delay with the ogle telescope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( udalski , kubiak , & szymaski 1997 ) ) .",
    "the ogle group was at that time focussing exclusively on lmc and galactic bulge microlensing , but he1104 - 1805 is at a very different right ascension .",
    "three years of superb ogle data were obtained in which no believable correlated variations were observed .",
    "but there were appreciable uncorrelated variations , most of which were attributable to the brighter of the two images .",
    "after three years we admitted defeat and wrote a paper about microlensing ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( schechter et al . 2003 ) ) which was , after all , ogle s primary mission .",
    "the ogle telescope was out of commission for upgrades during much of the following year ; a few data points were obtained but were never reduced .",
    "but by then @xcite had begun monitoring he1104 - 1805 at the wise observatory .",
    "they used our data in conjunction with theirs to give a time delay that differed by a factor of two from the one used in figure [ fig : courbin ] .",
    "after ofek and maoz published their delay , @xcite reduced the remaining ogle data , confirming their value and giving the lightcurves in figure  [ fig : he1104 ] .",
    "notice that the error bars are smaller for the @xmath13 image , yet the lightcurve is smoother for the @xmath14 image .",
    "image @xmath13 appears to vary with an amplitude of 0.06 magnitudes on a timescale of one week .",
    "the interpretation of these fluctuations is somewhat speculative , but there is no question that microlensing represents an another difficulty for time delay measurements of @xmath11 .",
    "one last difficulty associated with estimating @xmath11 is implicit in the fact that only 10% of the hundred or so known lensed quasars appear in figure  [ fig : courbin ] .",
    "when we think of quasar variability we think of 3c273 or 3c279 and variations of a magnitude or more . but",
    "those quasars are well known precisely because of their variability .",
    "most quasars are considerably more boring .",
    "systematic studies of quasar variability at optical wavelengths consistently give rms fluctuations of order 10 - 15% on proper timescales of one year (;",
    "* vanden berk et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "the good news is that a few quasars vary more than this .",
    "the bad news is that most vary even less than this .",
    "the statistics may be somewhat better for radio quasars , but then radio loud systems constitute only 10% of all quasars . while the small amplitude of quasar variations may give graduate students ( mostly those working at radio wavelengths ) an opportunity to show their skill in beating down their observational errors , flat lightcurves do nt lead to offers of prestigious postdocs .",
    "it should be noted that there is considerable room for improvement in the optical lightcurves , for which the observational errors are much larger than photon statistics would imply .",
    "our list of major difficulties in measuring @xmath11 has grown to include the following :    * the paucity of constraints , * the mass sheet degeneracy , * the central concentration degeneracy , * multiple lenses , * microlensing and * small variability amplitudes .",
    "the difficulties we have described are sufficiently common that almost every lensed quasar is subject to at least one of them . in general",
    "( though there are important exceptions ) the double systems suffer from a paucity of constraints .",
    "many quadruples suffer either from the mass sheet degeneracy ( due to a nearby cluster ) or from multiple lensing galaxies . only a few systems ( mostly radio loud quasars ) have multiple sources permitting unambiguous determination of a radial density exponent .",
    "are there _ any _ lenses which are not obviously subject to one or another of these difficulties ?",
    "a decade ago we imagined finding a `` perfect '' or `` golden '' lens that would permit determination of @xmath11 with small uncertainty .",
    "a lens that was not subject to any of the above difficulties might reasonably qualify for certification as a golden lens .",
    "the system jvas0218 + 357 ( * ? ? ? * ( patnaik et al .",
    "1992 ) ) is such a system .",
    "it is a radio double that , at vlbi resolution , has a core and a blob ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( biggs et al . 2003 ) ) of the sort that radio astronomers fancifully call jets .",
    "the double source breaks the concentration degeneracy , and implies an isothermal potential . @xcite have modeled the radio data , finding the radial exponent and the center of symmetry of the lensing potential ( see also wucknitz contribution to the present proceedings ) .",
    "the time delay has been measured with better than 5% accuracy ( * ? ? ? * ( biggs et al . 1999 ) ) .",
    "but even this system is not 24 carat gold .",
    "the pairs of images are separated by only @xmath15 , implying a low luminosity lens , almost certainly not an elliptical . @xcite",
    "have co - added data from a large number of hst orbits ( see also jackson and york s contribution to the present proceedings ) .",
    "after careful psf subtraction of the two quasar images , their data clearly shows an m101-like spiral .",
    "the residuals from psf subtraction crowd the nucleus of the galaxy , making it difficult to measure its centroid accurately .",
    "the position of the center is crucial because of the strong dependence of the differential delay on the image distances .",
    "the agreement between the york et al . optical position and",
    "the wucknitz center of symmetry is excellent ( figure  [ fig : york ] ) .",
    "the radio position gives @xmath16 km / s / mpc ( @xmath17 uncertainty ) .",
    "the work on jvas0218 + 357 is remarkable for the range of astronomical techniques and resources that have been brought to bear on the system .",
    "it was discovered ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( patnaik et al . 1992 ) ) and monitored ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( biggs et al . 1999 ) ) at radio wavelengths using the vla and merlin .",
    "the global vlbi data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( biggs et al . 2003 ) ) are crucial to the modeling .",
    "the redshift for the lens ( * ? ? ? * ( browne , patnaik , walsh , & wilkinson 1993 ) ) required large ground based optical telescopes .",
    "measuring the position of the lensing galaxy required hst ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( york et al . 2004 ) ) , as is the case for most lenses .",
    "by the standards set forth in this paper , only one gravitationally lensed quasar qualifies as a golden lens . taken by itself it gives a hubble constant with a formal uncertainty as small or smaller than that obtained with cepheids .",
    "but prudence demands at least one more golden lens before declaring that lenses do as well as ( let alone better than ) cepheids .",
    "the remaining systems with time delay measurements are not without value .",
    "the central concentration degeneracy may reasonably be lifted by appeal to other ( non - variable ) lensed systems for which the central concentration _ can _ be measured , or alternatively , by appeal to measurements of gravitational potentials of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "the present author would guess that the systematic errors associated with either of these assumptions would introduce an error of perhaps 5% in the hubble constant .",
    "this would rehabilitate those optical quadruple systems that suffer only from the central concentration degeneracy .",
    "optical double systems suffer from both the central concentration degeneracy and the paucity of constraints .",
    "as they have no internal redundancy , their usefulness will depend upon the scatter in @xmath11 values observed from a good - sized sample of such systems .    in the case of b1608 + 656",
    ", the outstanding question is whether the data are so good that , merging lenses notwithstanding , all plausible models give the same value of @xmath11 .",
    "what is needed now is the effort of a `` loyal opposition '' to search the far corners of model space .",
    "new telescopes and upgrades to existing telescopes are certain to produce new gravitational lenses , and with them we will eventually see a hubble constant that is less uncertain than that obtained from cepheids .",
    "even those who take it as a matter of faith that the universe is perfectly flat may find such a direct measurement of @xmath11 interesting ."
