    "it is now well established that pulsars are neutron stars with a very strong magnetic field .",
    "the surface magnetic field manifests itself by synchrotron radiation from the pulsar magnetosphere and its magnitude for young neutron stars has been estimated @xcite to be as large as @xmath1 g .",
    "the internal magnetic field may not manifest at the surface and therefore its strength is controversial but , because of the high conductivity of the core , the value of the magnetic field is expected to be further increased .",
    "considering the flux throughout the star as a simply trapped primordial flux , one obtains an internal magnetic field intensity of the order @xmath2  g , even if one neglects a possible twisting of the field , an effect that would intensify the field additionally by several orders of magnitude . the time duration of the large - scale magnetic field decay via the mechanism of ambipolar diffusion might be about a few decades or a hundred year @xcite .",
    "such a simple hypothesis meets , however , a reasonable criticism , because nascent neutron stars are convective .",
    "some works have been devoted to develop an alternative to the origin of the internal magnetic field @xcite , based on the convective dynamo mechanism , which gives rise to a magnetic field of the order @xmath3  g inside neutron stars . however , in spite of the fact that we do not know yet any appropriate mechanism to produce more intense magnetic fields , the scalar virial theorem @xcite allows the field magnitude to be as large as @xmath2  g. magnetic field of this magnitude , and even more intense , have been recently discussed @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as possibly existing inside some neutron stars and other compact astrophysical objects . to constrain the magnetic field inside neutron stars ,",
    "it would be helpful to search for any observable consequences of a superstrong magnetic field .",
    "for example , one can observe a rapid motion of the neutron star under the recoil action , due to anisotropic neutrino emission induced by an intense magnetic field @xcite , @xcite or one can analyze the effect of a magnetic field on the neutron star mass @xcite .",
    "moreover , if superstrong magnetic fields exist in the interior of young neutron stars , new processes would be open , and standard processes would be also modified by the magnetic field , thus changing the evolution of those stars .",
    "studying the influence of these modifications and confrontation with observational data can be used to put some bounds on the initial magnetic field .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider one of these modifications , and to motivate further research on this field .    as we will show , a crucial mechanism when considering the cooling of neutron stars with superstrong magnetic fields are the direct urca reactions @xmath4 @xmath5 where the symbol @xmath6 on the top of the arrow means that the reactions rates have to be calculated for particle states in the magnetic field .",
    "we will consider degenerate , nonrelativistic nuclear matter and ultrarelativistic degenerate electrons under @xmath0-equilibrium .",
    "matter is assumed to be totally transparent for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "we also assume that at zero temperature the neutron star is @xmath0-stable , but at non - zero temperature @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) reactions ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ n ] ) proceed near the fermi energies @xmath9 of the participating particles . in the field - free case , for reactions @xmath10 ;",
    "@xmath11 to take place , momentum conservation near the fermi surfaces requires the following inequality among the fermi momenta of the proton ( @xmath12 ) , the electron ( @xmath13 ) and neutron ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath15 together with the charge neutrality condition , the above inequality leads to the threshold for proton concentration @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the number densities of protons and neutrons , respectively .",
    "this means that , in the field - free case , direct urca reactions are strongly suppressed by pauli blocking in the neutron - rich nuclear matter ( assuming matter is formed only by protons , neutrons and electrons ) .    in magnetized media , transversal momenta of charged particles",
    "are defined only within an accuracy @xmath19 .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) so that direct urca processes are allowed in the degenerate n - p - e system under @xmath0-equilibrium for an arbitrary proton concentration .",
    "we examine reactions ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ n ] ) in a constant magnetic field large enough so that is the absolute value of electron charge",

    "] @xmath24 . in this case",
    "the fermi energy of degenerate electrons is smaller than the energy of the first excited landau level @xmath25 . in other words , at zero temperature , all electrons occupy only the ground landau band and are polarized in the direction opposite to the magnetic field .",
    "the number density of electrons reads @xmath26 where @xmath13 is the fermi momentum of degenerate electrons .",
    "following charge neutrality @xmath27 , one obtains the proton fermi momentum @xmath12 to be equal to @xmath13 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath24 , then degenerate protons are also confined to the ground landau state and are totally polarized in the direction parallel to the external magnetic field .",
    "we choose our coordinate system in such a way that @xmath28 . as will be obtained through the next sections , under the conditions mentioned above the direct urca process ( [ pe ] ) and ( [ n ] ) gives raise to a large neutrino luminosity during the first 10 yr . of the strongly magnetized neutron star .",
    "such large luminosity would lead to an anomalously cold neutron star , a fact that can be confronted with observational data and eventually used to put some bounds on the initial magnetic field .",

    "as we will show later , opening or closing of these channels will give rise to jumps on the emissivity .",
    "in order to estimate numerically the emissivity of the direct urca process in a strongly magnetized neutron star , we consider nuclear matter and electrons in @xmath0-equilibrium within a nonrelativistic hartree approach in the linear @xmath67-@xmath121-@xmath122 model , as it was made ( relativistically ) in @xcite , but with taking into account the anomalous magnetic moments of proton and neutron in the energies for these particles . then the interaction energies for protons and neutrons are given by @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the total number density of baryons and @xmath125 . also , @xmath126 the parameters for the coupling constants and mesons masses are taken from @xcite to be @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . in this model",

    ", one would also like to find the nucleon effective mass @xmath133 from this modified model .",
    "however , this would add some ( perhaps unessential ) calculation problems .",
    "our purpose here is to point out some qualitative new results and motivate more realistic computations . for this reason ,",
    "we have chosen for our estimates the values of the effective mass that are given by @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we have taken @xmath134 for @xmath132 equal to nuclear saturation density , which is @xmath135 in this model , and @xmath136 for @xmath137 .    in fig .",
    "1 we have plotted the emissivity of the direct urca process , calculated from eq .",
    "( [ finnumeric ] ) as a function of the magnetic field intensity ( in units of @xmath138 ) for two values of the baryon density : @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "we have chosen , as a representative value for the temperature , @xmath141 .",
    "as one can see from this figure , if the magnetic field is larger than @xmath142 , the @xmath143 emissivity from the neutron star is many orders of magnitude larger than that in the standard cooling scenario .",
    "another feature which is readily observed is that , as magnetic field increases , jumps on the emissivity can appear .",
    "the first jump in the curve @xmath139 is due to @xmath144 becoming negative when @xmath145 .",
    "the second , much smaller one , at @xmath146 , corresponds to @xmath147 becoming zero . for the curve @xmath140",
    "we observe a different situation : @xmath144 is always negative , but an abrupt increase appears due to the fact that @xmath148 is first negative and , as magnetic field increases , it becomes positive at @xmath149 .",
    "due to the transitions discussed above , it becomes difficult to find an overall analytic formula to fit the emissivity dependence upon the magnetic field intensity , although it is possible to find a fitting formula which describes the gross tendency of @xmath150 ( without the details described above ) for a particular value of the baryon density .",
    "we have found , when @xmath139 that the emissivity can be approximated by : @xmath151 where @xmath152 .",
    "we now discuss the implications of the large emissivity produced by the urca reactions in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "of course , in order to make detailed calculations , one needs to incorporate this emissivity into an elaborated neutron star cooling code . aside from this , it is clear that other processes will also be modified in presence of the strong magnetic field ( and maybe new processes will be possible ) . however , such considerations are out of the scope of this paper , as we discussed in the introduction .",
    "here , we will only present some simple estimates .    as it is evident from fig .",
    "1 , the emissivity depends very strongly on the magnetic field intensity .",
    "one expects that an initial strong @xmath6 will decay within a time @xmath153 .",
    "hence , even if the luminosity due to the urca process is very high at the beginning , it will become very small for @xmath154 @xmath153 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the characteristic decaying time for a superstrong magnetic field is @xmath155 yr . in order to incorporate this effect , we have taken , as the time variation of @xmath6 : @xmath156    let us also assume that the thermal energy @xmath157 of matter can be approximated by that of a degenerate neutron gas , then per unit volume one has : @xmath158 since a neutron interacts with the external magnetic field only due to its anomalous magnetic moment , the thermal energy of a degenerate neutron gas will only slightly change under the action of the magnetic field . neglecting this difference we assume  @xmath159 .",
    "one has to solve the equation @xmath160    which can be rewritten as @xmath161    for our estimate , we will consider a fixed value of the density , with @xmath162 . then @xmath163 .",
    "we have also chosen an initial value of the magnetic field @xmath164 and the temperature @xmath165 .",
    "for the emissivity , we use the approximate formula eq .",
    "( [ enb ] ) . equation ( [ difft ] ) can then be solved numerically .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "2 , where the vertical axes represents @xmath108 and the abscissa gives the time ( in years ) . as seen from this figure , the temperature drops very fast at the beginning due to the urca emission .",
    "however , as @xmath6 goes to zero , the emission will decrease and the temperature stabilizes to a value which , in this case , is of the order of @xmath166 . in fig .",
    "3 we have plotted the urca luminosity that arises from the above simplified model , with an assumed neutron star radius @xmath167 . here , one observes the large luminosity at early times and its rapid decrease due to the temperature drop . there is an ulterior secular decrease of the luminosity as a consequence of the magnetic field decay , so that @xmath168 will become negligeable for @xmath169 .",
    "standard emission processes will then dominate the neutron star cooling .",
    "in this work we have considered the direct urca process in degenerate nuclear matter under @xmath0-equilibrium in a strong magnetic field .",
    "these reactions are strongly suppressed by pauli blocking in the field - free case , but we showed that , in a magnetic field @xmath170 , direct urca reactions are open for an arbitrary proton concentration , and will lead to a phase of fast neutron star cooling .",
    "a simple estimate shows that , after a rapid cooling epoch ( around 10 yr . or so ) , the neutron star temperature becomes one order of magnitude lower than in the field - free case , a result which is in discrepancy with observations of pulsar data .",
    "one then can conclude that neutron stars with characteristic cooling times of the order @xmath171  years , as in the standard scenario , could not have an initial magnetic field comparable or larger than the critical value @xmath172 , at least  in the whole volume of the central core . on the other hand ,",
    "if such stars exist , one has to search for anomalously cold neutron stars .  in order to investigate the implications of this process ,",
    "we have considered a very simple model . to simplify calculations",
    "we also restricted ourselves to the above values of the magnetic field .",
    "this approach makes possible to treat all protons and electrons as occupying only the ground landau bands at zero temperature .",
    "however , as one can see from fig .",
    "1 , the direct urca process can substantially contribute to neutron star cooling , even if the magnetic field is smaller than the value considered above . for",
    "the urca processes to be effective one needs the electron momentum uncertainty @xmath173  to be of the order of the transversal momentum itself @xmath174 .",
    "this condition is still valid when electrons occupy a few landau bands with @xmath175 .",
    "we also have considered matter densities not much larger than saturation densities . for these densities ,",
    "nucleons can be treated as non - relativistic particles .",
    "more realistic calculation imply additional complications .",
    "if one intends to go to densities larger than the saturation density , then relativistic effects for nucleons should be taken into account and the many - level approximation should be used in order to calculate the energy loss via the direct urca process .",
    "the standard processes should be also modified with taking into account a superstrong magnetic field . by making such a detailed simulation one could put more stringent bounds on the initial intensity of the magnetic field .",
