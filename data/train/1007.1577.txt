    "coupled quantum dots are not only interesting from the theoretical point of view but also promising for designing quantum - coherent devices , including spin - based quantum bits .",
    "however , phonon - related processes are inevitable in a cristal environment and may limit the feasibility of implementing quantum control in these systems . on the other hand , in many applications ( e.g. , lasers ) fast relaxation between two states is desired .",
    "therefore , it is essential to understand not only the spectral properties of various kinds of semiconductor nanostructures but also phonon - induced processes .    carrier transfer and relaxation in self - assembled structures was observed in many experiments . in those works ,",
    "optical spectroscopy methods were used in stacked qdms @xcite .",
    "miscellaneous mechanisms could be responsible for the observed properties .",
    "the heterogeneity of considered structures and posible transfer mechanisms is reflected in a relatively wide distribution of the measured transfer rates .",
    "however , in most cases the kinetics is attributed to tunneling @xcite .    in recent works ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we studied phonon - induced relaxation in one- and two - particle systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we investigated the dependence of the relaxation on the system geometry . in this contribution , we also take into account dependence on external ( axial ) electric field for one- and two - particle systems .",
    "we show that phonon - induced relaxationmay be controlled either by system geometry or by external electric field .",
    "the system under consideration is composed of two vertically stacked qds , formed in the stransky ",
    "krastanov self - assembly process .",
    "the dots are modeled as spherical domes of hights @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( the index `` 1 '' refers to the lower dot ) and base radii @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the domes rest on wetting layer of thickness @xmath4 and are separated by a distance d ( base - to - base ) .",
    "the details of the model and the parameter values are given in ref .",
    "we consider inas dots in a gaas enviroment .",
    "approximately , our system has an axial symetry , so it is treated as cylindrically symmetric .",
    "this assumption strongly simplifies our calculations .",
    "the lattice constants mismatch leads to the appearance of strain .",
    "the strain distribution is represented by displacement fields that are found by minimizing the elastic energy of the system @xcite .",
    "states of an electron in the strained nanostructure in the present approach are determined by the position - dependent conduction band edge and by the effective masses , which also vary across the structure .",
    "the local band structure is obtained from the 8-band hamiltonian with strain - induced terms ( bir - pikus hamiltonian ) using the lwdin elimination @xcite . from this",
    ", we calculate the conduction band edge and the effective mass tensor as a function of the spatial position .",
    "the electron wave functions are calculated within a variational multi - component envelope function approximation for equation with the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6,@xmath7 are the components of the effective mass tensor , @xmath8 is electrical field magnitude , @xmath9 is the conduction band edge and @xmath10 is electron charge .",
    "next , we derive two - particle states within the standard configuration - interaction approach in a restricted basis of lowest - energy configurations ( only two lowest single - electron states are included ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the interacting two - electron system has the form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 here @xmath13 are single - particle eigenfunctions , @xmath14 is the vacuum permittivity , and @xmath15 is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor .",
    "after diagonalizing the hamiltonian , we obtain three lowest singlet states .    finally , we derive the phonon - assisted relaxation between the single - electron states as well as between the two lowest two - electron states .",
    "the coupling between the electrons and phonons is described by the hamiltonian @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the coupling constants .",
    "we use the fermi golden rule to calculate the relaxation rates between the lowest energy eigenstates . in the calculation of phonon - induced relaxation rates ,",
    "we take into account carrier - phonon couplings via deformation potential and piezoelectric interactions .",

    "the relaxation rates are similar to those found in the single electron case .",
    "this is due to the fact that both these processes are physically very similar .",
    "the only difference is that in the single electron case it tunnels towards an empty qd , whereas in the two electron case , there is already another electron .",
    "it leads to shifts ( due to coulomb interaction ) to the parameter regimes where energies compensates for the coulomb repulsion .",
    "we have studied the phonon - assisted relaxation ( thermalization ) for single - electron and two - electron configurations in self - assembled quantum dots .",
    "our model has taken into account the geometry and strain distribution in a qdm .",
    "the results show that the phonon relaxation is very efficient in a very narrow range of parameters near the anticrossings of energy levels .",
    "we conclude that relaxation times on the order of at least hundreds of picoseconds should be typical .",
    "the results for an electric field and various upper dot sizes are quantitatively consistent .",
    "therefore , it is possible to control phonon  induced relaxation by system geometry as well as by an external electric field ."
