    "thyroid cancer is one of common cancers , whose incidence increases in accordance with developments of biomedical imaging modalities @xcite .",
    "there are several kinds of thyroid cancers , and most of them can be accurately diagnosed by using the ultrasound tomography and fine needle aspiration cytology to examine the cellular structures @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma is still difficult , because neither the ultrasound tomography nor the needle aspiration cytology can differentiate between them .",
    "hence , other imaging modality is essential for comprehensive diagnosis of thyroid cancer .",
    "diffuse optical tomography ( dot ) has a potential to accurately and non - invasively diagnose whether the tumor is benign or malignant based on the difference in optical properties @xcite .",
    "the optical properties ( e.g. the absorption and scattering coefficients , and anisotropic factor ) characterize the strength of absorption and scattering of light by a turbid medium such as biological tissue . unlike a conventional image reconstruction algorithm for x - ray computed tomography ,",
    "of which fundamentals are measuring line integrals of the attenuation coefficients and solving a set of integral equations for the attenuation coefficients , dot needs an inversion process to reconstruct a distribution of tomographic image of the optical properties inside the tissues based on a mathematical model describing the diffusive nature of photon migration in scattering media @xcite .",
    "hence , for obtaining a high quality image of dot , an accurate photon migration model is essential , and an efficient scheme for solving the model is required .",
    "mainly , two types of the governing equations for photon migration have been used : the radiative transport equation ( rte ) and the diffusion equation ( de ) .",
    "the rte can accurately describe photon migration in wide ranges of time - length scales , and numerical schemes for solving the rte have extensively been developed by using the finite - difference @xcite , finite - element @xcite , and finite - volume methods @xcite .    however , their computational loads for solving the rte are heavy because the rte is an integro - differential equation with many independent variables . due to this reason ,",
    "the rte has usually been applied to small - sized media such as human fingers and rats .",
    "meanwhile , the de can be applied to large - sized media ( e.g. the human brain ) @xcite because the approximation can decrease the number of the independent variables to reduce the computational loads .",
    "however , it is well understood the de is valid in spatial and temporal regions after photons undergo a sufficient number of scattering events . in non - scattering or void regions ,",
    "the de is invalid and fails to describe photon migration @xcite .",
    "the human neck is a large - sized and inhomogeneous medium consisting of the trachea , arteries , veins , muscles , bones , adipose tissue , and so on .",
    "the trachea is a void region where photons travel straight without being absorbed and scattered . also , the arteries and veins are highly absorbing regions , where photons are totally absorbed before photons undergo a sufficient number of scattering events for the de to be valid .",
    "considering the above - mentioned characteristics of the human neck , an efficient scheme for solving the rte is still in need of further development .",
    "this paper develops the numerical scheme for solving the rte using the finite - difference and discrete - ordinate methods ( the 3rd order upwind and the 4th order runge - kutta methods ) . at first ,",
    "the validity of the developed scheme is confirmed for homogeneous media by comparison with analytical solutions .",
