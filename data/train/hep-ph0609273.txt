    "<S> [ fig : diagrams](c ) , where we take @xmath42 gev@xmath41 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now we come to an important observation . </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath43 in , then @xmath44 and the inhomogeneous term would be a higher - twist power - like correction , which is usually neglected and so collinear factorisation would hold in ddis . </S>",
    "<S> however , as @xmath45 , the gluon density grows as @xmath46 , with anomalous dimension @xmath47 , while in the hera domain @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> this compensates for the @xmath49 power - like suppression in . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore can not neglect the inhomogeneous term in .    using only the perturbative framework , </S>",
    "<S> that is , just the diagrams in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagrams](a , c ) , down to a very low scale would , of course , be unreliable . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is reasonable to assume that all the contributions originating from these low scales , @xmath11 , are parameterised in terms of an unknown non - perturbative input , which is schematically presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : diagrams](b ) . unlike the unknown input required to analyse inclusive dis which depends on a single momentum fraction , </S>",
    "<S> here we have an unknown input which depends on two momentum fractions , @xmath13 and @xmath50 . in this non - perturbative domain </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to assume a regge behaviour , in which the @xmath13 dependence is given by the sum of regge poles ( including possible interference terms ) , and that each pole generates input diffractive parton distributions with a freely - parameterised @xmath50 behaviour , where the parameters are to be determined by fitting to the ddis data . </S>",
    "<S> note that for very low @xmath13 it would be sufficient to keep just pomeron exchange .    </S>",
    "<S> thus in the pqcd approach we consider the dpdfs to be a sum of pomeron and secondary reggeon contributions , @xmath51 where we have neglected the possible interference term , as is the usual practice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we parameterise the input quark - singlet and gluon dpdfs for the leading pomeron pole at a starting scale @xmath26 in the form : @xmath52 where the pomeron flux factor is taken from regge phenomenology @xcite , @xmath53 with @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary reggeon contributions may be included in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> however , in practice , the ddis data at large @xmath13 are insufficient to constrain the input secondary reggeon parameters . instead , following h1 @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we fix the @xmath50 and @xmath10 dependence of @xmath55 to be the same as the pionic parton distributions , that is , we neglect the inhomogeneous terms in the evolution , and fit only an overall normalisation factor @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this is reasonable since the secondary reggeons are important only for larger @xmath13 , where the anomalous dimension is not large enough to cancel the power suppression in the corresponding perturbative pomeron flux factors . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the perturbative domain , the secondary reggeons are mainly non - singlet quarks which , even at very small @xmath13 , have a small ( or negative ) anomalous dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this completes the summary of the pqcd procedure which is necessary to describe ddis .    </S>",
    "<S> now we introduce the regge factorisation approach and relate it to the above pqcd procedure . in the `` regge '' description the last term in and the inhomogeneous term in are neglected . </S>",
    "<S> the factorising regge input , and , is used in the remaining , now homogeneous , dglap evolution equations , . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is justified for sufficiently large @xmath26 and fixed @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the smaller the value of @xmath13 , the larger the value of @xmath26 has to be to justify the pure regge approach by the linear evolution equations starting from input generated by some set of regge poles . of course </S>",
    "<S> , at a large scale it may be necessary to have a more complicated structure in the complex angular momentum plane than simply the pomeron and secondary reggeon poles . </S>",
    "<S> ] . what happens if the regge approach is applied for smaller values of @xmath26 ? </S>",
    "<S> the non - negligible last term in is attempting to be mimicked by enlarging the regge input at @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence we obtain the wrong @xmath7 dependence of the dpdfs . </S>",
    "<S> we can readily glimpse what the result will be . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally we measure @xmath57 , which is dominantly determined by the diffractive quark density . </S>",
    "<S> thus , to mimic the @xmath7 dependence of the last term in in a pure regge fit , we would expect to obtain a larger gluon at relatively large @xmath50 so as to provide a faster growth of the quark density with increasing @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> how different are the diffractive parton distributions obtained from fits to the ddis data using the `` pqcd '' and the simpler `` regge '' approaches ? to see this , we perform fits to the latest h1 lrg data @xcite for the diffractive reduced cross section @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose this particular data set because h1 have already performed a `` regge '' parton analysis to precisely these data with @xmath59 gev and @xmath60 gev@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the same kinematic cuts , in order to allow a direct comparison with the h1 2006 analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath61 as a free parameter in and fix @xmath62 gev@xmath41 and @xmath63 gev@xmath41 @xcite , as in the h1 fit . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the secondary reggeon contributions are also included in a similar way to the h1 2006 analysis @xcite , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 gev@xmath41 and @xmath66 gev@xmath41 @xcite , but using the grv nlo pionic parton distributions </S>",
    "<S> @xcite rather than the owens lo set @xcite . the number of parameters in the pqcd and regge descriptions are the same , since the inhomogeneous term and _ direct _ pomeron contributions are calculated explicitly @xcite , at leading order , and have no free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we choose to take the input parameterisations at @xmath67 gev@xmath9 , again to keep close to the value used in the h1 analysis @xcite , and because the inclusive parton densities which appear in the pqcd approach are not well known below @xmath68 gev@xmath9 where there are no data included in the global fits . </S>",
    "<S> we use the mrst2004f3 nlo pdfs @xcite in the pqcd fits . </S>",
    "<S> the inhomogeneous evolution is implemented via a modified version of the qcdnum @xcite nlo dglap program .    for the pomeron contribution , we include heavy quarks in the fixed flavour number scheme ( ffns ) , where there are no heavy quark dpdfs , with @xmath69 gev and @xmath70 gev , and use a three - flavour @xmath71 with @xmath72 mev @xcite . for the _ resolved _ pomeron case , </S>",
    "<S> heavy quarks are generated via photon  </S>",
    "<S> gluon fusion at nlo @xcite with the renormalisation and factorisation scales taken to be @xmath73 where @xmath74 . for the secondary reggeon case , the contribution to the diffractive structure functions from heavy quarks </S>",
    "<S> is included using the zero - mass variable flavour number scheme , and we take the same values of @xmath71 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 as in the determination of the pion pdfs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ direct _ pomeron terms @xmath77 , that is , the second terms on the right - hand - side of , are calculated at lo using : @xmath78 where the equation numbers refer to the appendix of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for light quarks , the lower limit of the @xmath7 integration in these equations is replaced by @xmath26 , since the contribution from @xmath11 is included in the input dpdfs taken at a scale @xmath26 . for @xmath79 the light - quark contributions in the limit @xmath80 are subtracted since they are already included in the first term of . this subtraction defines a choice of factorisation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> there is no such subtraction for @xmath81 , which are purely higher - twist , or for the heavy quark contributions since we are working in the ffns .    </S>",
    "<S> .input parameters ( corresponding to @xmath82 ) determined in the regge and pqcd fits to h1 lrg data @xcite with @xmath83 gev@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the @xmath84 errors on the parameters are generally smaller in the pqcd fit . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        gev@xmath9 compared to the h1 2006 fit a @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all the dpdfs plotted here are normalised to @xmath85 gev by multiplying by a factor 1.23 relative to @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> only the pomeron contribution is shown and not the secondary reggeon contributions which are negligible at the value of @xmath87 chosen here . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : dpdf ] . during the fits , statistical and systematic experimental errors were added in quadrature . </S>",

    "<S> the parameters are given in table [ tab : params ] and correspond to @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> as is to be expected , there are only very small differences between our `` regge '' fit and the h1 2006 fit a. , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , the heavy quark renormalisation and factorisation scales , and the pion pdfs . however , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dpdf ] , these minor details are not important . ] </S>",
    "<S> the value of the @xmath61 parameter in the pqcd fit is @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a bit higher than the value of the intercept 1.08 @xcite coming from soft hadron phenomenology , since the input distributions are taken at @xmath67 gev@xmath9 , and already account for some pqcd contribution which is known to be present at this scale . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in going from @xmath90 to @xmath91 photoproduction , the effective pomeron intercept increases from about 1.09 @xcite to 1.20 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that a detailed comparison of the intercepts would require a study of the correlation between the fitted @xmath61 and the assumed @xmath92 , whereas here we have fixed @xmath93 gev@xmath41 to agree with the h1 analysis @xcite .    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dpdf ] we see that the diffractive quark singlet distribution , @xmath94 , is relatively stable in going from the pqcd approach to the simplified regge approach . however , as anticipated , the diffractive gluon distribution , @xmath95 , is greatly suppressed for @xmath96 in the pqcd approach relative to the gluon obtained using the regge approach .    </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained here are stable to the inclusion of ddis data from the h1 fps @xcite , the zeus leading proton spectrometer ( lps ) @xcite , and the zeus diffractive charm reduced cross section @xcite , as well as being stable to including h1 lrg data @xcite down to @xmath97 gev@xmath9 . at an input scale of @xmath67 gev@xmath9 , the results are also stable to an extra parameter in the input distributions in the form of an additional factor @xmath98 and to the use of an alternative input parameterisation in terms of chebyshev polynomials , </S>",
    "<S> although this is no longer the case if a higher input scale is used such as @xmath99 gev@xmath9 .    </S>",

    "<S> measurements of the diffractive charm reduced cross section and the fractional contribution of charm to the total diffractive cross section have recently been shown to be in excellent agreement with these predictions ; see figs .  </S>",

    "<S> the h1 collaboration have recently presented a preliminary combined fit @xcite , within the regge factorisation framework , of their inclusive ddis data @xcite with preliminary data on diffractive dijet production @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dpdfs from this combined fit , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dpdf ] , have a much smaller diffractive gluon density at moderate to high @xmath50 compared to the h1 2006 fit a. moreover , the @xmath106 for the 190 inclusive ddis points increases from 158 ( h1 2006 fit a ) to 169 ( h1 combined fit ) on inclusion of the dijet data . therefore , the gluon density determined indirectly from the inclusive ddis data , under the assumption of pure dglap evolution , is different from the gluon density preferred by the dijet data . on the other hand , our pqcd fit naturally has a smaller gluon density at moderate to high @xmath50 than the h1 2006 fit a , due to the presence of the extra inhomogeneous term in the evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the apparent tension between the inclusive ddis and dijet data in the regge factorisation approach is partly alleviated by the inclusion of the perturbative pomeron terms . as a consequence </S>",
