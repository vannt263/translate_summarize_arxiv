    "aim of this contribution is to present a fully covariant model for describing the electromagnetic ( em ) decay of vector mesons ( vm s ) , both in light and heavy sectors . to this end ,",
    "a simple analytic form for the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) amplitude of vm s is adopted in order to perform without any further approximation the calculations of the decay constants . moreover , with such an ansatz one can easily evaluate the so - called transverse momentum distribution of a constituent inside the vm ( see de melo et al @xcite for the pion case ) , that plays an essential role for fixing the value of the parameters appearing in our approach , and in turn for including some non perturbative inputs in our analytical ansatz . a possible form of the bs amplitude for an interacting @xmath0 system with @xmath1 ,",

    "in particular , the adopted covariant form for the dirac structure is the familiar one ( transverse to @xmath4 ) , viz v^(p ) = m m+m_1+m_2  that in the limit of non interacting system leads to the melosh rotations for a @xmath10 system @xcite , as expected .",
    "for the present preliminary calculations , the momentum dependence has the following simple form with single poles , viz _",
