    "in a future , at the time when a scalable quantum computer is realized , there will be much demand for the blind quantum computation  @xcite , since the quantum computer must be super - expensive and super - fragile , and therefore only limited number of servers can possess it . in particular , it is likely that a client ( alice ) who has only a classical computer or a primitive quantum instrument which is not sufficient for the universal quantum computation will ask a quantum server ( bob ) to perform her quantum computation on his fully - fledged quantum computer .",
    "bob runs his quantum computer according to alice s input and instructions , and finally returns the final output of the quantum computation to alice . the crucial point in the blind quantum computation",
    "is that alice does not want bob to learn her input , the algorithm she wants to run , and the final output of the computation .",
    "for example , if alice wants to factor a large integer by using shor s factoring algorithm  @xcite , the blind quantum computation must be performed in such a way that bob can not know her input ( the large integer ) , the output of the computation ( a prime factor ) , and even the fact that he is factoring .    for the classical computation ,",
    "feigenbaum  @xcite introduced the notion of  computing with encrypted data \" , and showed that for some functions @xmath0 , an instance @xmath1 can be efficiently encrypted into @xmath2 in such a way that alice can recover @xmath3 efficiently from @xmath4 and @xmath5 computed by bob . moreover",
    "abadi , feigenbaum and killian showed that no * np*-hard function  @xcite can be computed blindly if unconditional security is required , unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses at the third level  @xcite . even restricting the security condition to be only computational , the question of the possibility of blind computing , also known as fully homomorphic encryption , remined open for 30 years @xcite .",
    "unlike classical computing , quantum mechanics could overcome the limitation of computational security .",
    "an example of the blind quantum computation was first proposed by childs  @xcite where the quantum circuit model is adopted , and the register state is encrypted with quantum one - time pad scheme  @xcite so that bob who performs quantum gates learns nothing about information in the quantum register . in this method",
    ", however , alice needs to have a quantum memory and the ability to apply local pauli operators at each step .",
    "similarly the protocol proposed by arrighi and salvail @xcite requires multi - qubit preparations and measurements while aharonov , ben - or and eban s protocol @xcite requires a constant - sized quantum computer with memory .    on the other hand , in broadbent , fitzsimons and kashefi s protocol @xcite , adapted to the one - way quantum computation  @xcite all alice needs",
    "is a classical computer and a very weak quantum instrument , which emits random single - qubit states . in particular",
    ", she does not require any quantum memory and the protocol is unconditionally secure . in their scheme ,",
    "alice s quantum instrument emits states @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a random number which is secret to bob , and each state is directly sent to bob .",
    "bob keeps all these states in his quantum memory , and creates the spacial resource state , which is alike to the two - dimensional cluster state and called  the brickwork state \"  @xcite , by applying the controlled - z ( cz ) operation among appropriate qubits in the received states .",
    "alice calculates , by using her classical computer , the direction in which a qubit should be measured , and instructs the direction to bob after some modifications such that ( i ) the byproduct operators emerged from the previous bob s measurements are compensated , ( ii ) the random @xmath8 is canceled , and ( iii ) the true direction and the true measurement outcomes , which reveal alice s input , algorithm and output , remain secret to bob .",
    "bob does the measurement on the brickwork state according to the instruction from alice , and sends the measurement result to alice for the next measurement . after repeating such two - way classical communications between alice and bob ,",
    "their measurement - based quantum computation is finally finished , and bob returns the final result ( classical or quantum ) of the computation to alice . as is shown in  @xcite",
    ", bob learns nothing about alice s input , the algorithm she wants to run , and the final output of the computation . in the recent active interaction between condensed matter physics and quantum information science , plenty of novel resource states for the measurement - based quantum computation beyond the cluster state",
    "have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "these new resource states have several interesting features and advantages over the cluster state .",
    "for example , some of those resource states are gapped ground states of their parent hamiltonians , and therefore they can be easily prepared by cooling condensed matter systems and the measurement - based quantum computation can be protected from noise by the energy gap  @xcite . in particular , affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) states  @xcite are physically motivated important resource states  @xcite , since they are gapped ground states of a physically natural hamiltonian which has long been studied in condensed matter physics , and exhibit many novel features , such as the one - dimensional haldane phase  @xcite , the diluted antiferromagnetic order detected by the string order parameter  @xcite , and the effective spin-1/2 degree of freedom ( edge state ) appearing on the boundary of the chain  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown recently that the preparation of the aklt resource states is more efficient and simpler than that of the cluster state in linear optics with biphotons  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , not obvious that these novel resource states also admit blind quantum computation like the cluster state .",
    "they have drastically different properties compared to the cluster state or graph states in general , such as the local purity , the correlation property , and the entanglement property  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the actual computation over these new resources , such as the way of measurements and the way of compensating byproducts , are also strongly different from those over the cluster state  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show for the first time that the ground state measurement - based blind quantum computation is possible with aklt resource states .",
    "as we will see later , this is not a straightforward generalization of the blind quantum computation on the cluster state , although it borrows the general idea from @xcite .",
    "hence a new proof of security for the blind quantum computation with aklt states was also required . as a result",
    ", our new protocol can enjoy the advantages of the aklt resource states , namely the easy preparation of the resource state by cooling condensed matter systems , the natural protection of the quantum computation by the energy gap , and the simple and efficient preparation of the resource state in linear optics with biphotons .",
    "more precisely , we propose two methods , the single - server protocol and the double - server protocol . in the single - server protocol ( fig .",
    "[ single ] ) , there are two parties , called alice and bob .",
    "alice , the client , has a classical computer and a quantum instrument which is not sufficient for the universal quantum computation , whereas bob , the server , has a universal quantum computer .",
    "alice s quantum instrument emits random four - qubit states so - called  dango states \" each of which is directly sent to bob through the quantum channel ( fig .  [ single ] ( a ) ) , and bob stores all of them in his quantum memory .",
    "each dango state hides certain random number which is secret to bob , and these secret numbers are used later for the blind quantum computation . from dango states , bob creates the resource state , which is unitary equivalent to an aklt state ( fig .",
    "[ single ] ( b ) ) .",
    "alice calculates the angle in which a particle should be measured by using her classical computer , and sends the angle to bob through the classical channel .",
    "bob performs the measurement according to alice s information , and returns the result of the measurement to alice .",
    "they repeat this two - way classical communication ( fig .",
    "[ single ] ( c ) ) until they finish the computation .",
    "bob finally sends the final output of the quantum computation to alice .",
    "the whole protocol can be done in such a way that bob learns nothing about alice s input , output , and algorithm .",
    "recently an efficient scheme for preparation of aklt state with biphotons was proposed in  @xcite and it seems that our single - server protocol can be adapted to such a scheme but we leave it as an open question what the best implementation is .    as we argue later , the single - server protocol can not enjoy the energy - gap protection in condensed - matter systems , since bob can not prepare any natural parent hamiltonian without knowing hidden angles in dango states .",
    "moreover , although alice s quantum instrument is too primitive to perform the universal quantum computation , and it does not seem to be hard to implement this instrument in certain optical setups , it would be ideal if we can make alice completely classical . therefore , similar to @xcite",
    ", we consider an extension of the protocol to the double - server protocol . in the double - server protocol ( fig .",
    "[ double_plain ] ) , there are three parties alice , bob1 , and bob2 .",
    "alice , the client , has only a classical computer , whereas bob1 and bob2 , servers , have universal quantum computers .",
    "bob1 and bob2 share many bell pairs but they have no classical or quantum channel between them . in the double - server protocol",
    ", bob1 first creates aklt resource states ( fig .",
    "[ double_plain ] ( a ) ) .",
    "bob1 next adiabatically turns off the interaction between some particles and others in his resource state , and teleports these particles to bob2 by consuming bell pairs .",
    "bob1 sends alice the result of the measurement in the teleportation through the classical channel ( fig .",
    "[ double_plain ] ( b ) ) .",
    "note that due to the lack of any communication ( classical or quantum ) channels between bob1 and bob2 , the teleportation procedure from bobs point of view can be seen as a usage of a totally mixed channel where only alice knows how to correct the output of the channel .",
    "next , alice calculates the angle in which particles should be measured by using her classical computer , and sends bob2 the angle which is the sum of the calculated angle plus a random angle through the classical channel ( fig .",
    "[ double_plain ] ( c ) ) .",
    "bob2 performs the measurement in that angle and sends the result of the measurement to alice ( fig .",
    "[ double_plain ] ( d ) ) .",
    "alice sends the previous random angle to bob1 ( fig .",
    "[ double_plain ] ( e ) ) , and bob1 does the single - qubit rotation which compensates that random angle ( fig .",
    "[ double_plain ] ( f ) ) .",
    "bob1 and bob2 repeat this two - way classical communication with alice until they finish the computation .",
    "the whole protocol can be done in such a way that two bobs learn nothing about alice s input , output , and algorithm . as we will argue later",
    ", the scheme of double servers proposed in @xcite where bob1 prepares random states and bob2 performs the measurement that compensates that random angle , will not lead to a ground state bqc protocol without affecting the privacy condition . while our new protocol can fully benefit from the energy - gap protection in condensed - matter systems , without revealing any information about alice s secret computation .",
