    "due to the nonlinear nature of the einstein equations , finding their exact solutions has always been an important and challenging problem .",
    "it is a pleasant surprise if one can find an exact solution of such nonlinear equations , especially when they describe the gravitational field of a physically meaningful gravitational source .    in this paper , we study gyratons , a particularly interesting class of solutions of the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations in four and higher dimensions which describe the gravitational and electromagnetic fields of a pulse of a circularly polarized radiation beam or spinning ultrarelativistic particles . generally speaking",
    "the gyraton solutions represent the fields of a localized matter source with an intrinsic rotation which is moving at the speed of light .",
    "historically , the gravitational fields generated by light pulses without spin were originally studied in linear approximation by tolman @xcite in 1934 .",
    "later , exact solutions of the einstein  maxwell equations for such ` pencils of light ' were found and analyzed by peres @xcite and bonnor @xcite .",
    "these solutions belong to a general family of pp - waves @xcite .",
    "the simplest of such solutions describes the gravitational impulsive wave created by an infinitely thin beam with the delta - like time distribution of the light - pulse .",
    "this is the famous aichelburg  sexl metric @xcite which represents the field of a point - like null particle without a spin .",
    "it can be derived from the schwarzschild black hole metric in the ultrarelativistic limit , by taking the distributional limit of exact sandwich waves , or by the penrose ` cut and paste ' approach .",
    "the review of more general solutions for such impulsive waves @xcite and their construction methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "gravitational field of a spinning null fluid ",
    "so called spinning nullicon ",
    "was first discussed in 1970 by bonnor @xcite .",
    "possible interpretation of such matter source as a massless neutrino fields was given by griffiths @xcite .",
    "recently , these solutions have been investigated in greater detail and generalized by frolov , israel , fursaev and zelnikov , who have called them gyratons @xcite .    in four dimensions ,",
    "the gyratons propagating on the minkowski background are , outside the source , locally isometric to standard pp - waves .",
    "using a suitable gauge transformation one can always set to zero the nondiagonal terms in the gyraton metric , namely the @xmath0 components in the brinkmann form @xcite , which reflect the rotational part of the metric .",
    "however , they can not be eliminated globally , because the gauge invariant contour integral @xmath1 around the position of the gyraton is proportional to the angular momentum density of the gravitating source , which is generally nonvanishing .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "the structure of the source and its gravitational field is much richer .",
    "thus , in a generic case , outside the source one can not make the nondiagonal metric components @xmath0 zero , even locally .",
    "such higher - dimensional gyratons propagating in an asymptotically flat @xmath2-dimensional spacetime were studied in @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that the einstein equations for gyratons reduce to a set of linear equations in the euclidean @xmath3-dimensional transverse space , and that the gyraton metrics belong to a class of so called vsi spacetimes .",
    "these spacetimes have unique mathematical features .",
    "for example , due to their remarkable geometrical properties they describe not only the exact classical solution for the gyraton but also the exact solution of a corresponding quantum problem .",
    "this happens because quantum corrections to the classical solution vanish identically in all loops @xcite .",
    "subsequently , there were found various generalizations of the gyratons : charged ultrarelativistic sources propagating on the background of @xmath4-dimensional minkowski space @xcite , gyratons in the asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetime @xcite , and gyratons in the melvin spacetime @xcite . in the case of anti - de  sitter background",
    "the obtained gyratons generalize the siklos family of nonexpanding waves with a negative cosmological constant @xcite ( studied in detail in @xcite ) which belong to the class of csi spacetimes with constant scalar invariants @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric gyratons , as solutions of minimal gauged supergravity in five dimensions , has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the solutions of supergravity equations generated by string - like sources moving with the speed of light , the string gyratons , have been found in @xcite .    in our recent paper @xcite",
    "a large new class of 4-dimensional gyratons on the direct - product spacetimes has been found .",
    "we have shown that this class of gyratons has properties similar to other gyratonic solutions : the einstein equations reduce to a set of linear differential equations in the transverse constant - curvature 2-space , and these spacetimes also belong to the csi class .",
    "our results are applicable to the description of gyratons in the vicinity of the horizon of extremely charged black holes .",
    "indeed , the near - horizon geometry of these background spacetimes is @xmath5 and belongs exactly to the type of spacetimes we have considered .",
    "in fact , all the spaces studied in @xcite belong to the family of kundt spacetimes defined as those admitting a null vector field that is geodesic , without expansion , shear and twist @xcite .",
    "the kundt spacetimes are of great importance in standard general relativity and recently they have found a number of interesting applications in higher - dimensional theories , namely because of their unique curvature and holonomy structure .",
    "moreover , the kundt class involves various important special cases such as the pp - waves , vsi and csi spacetimes @xcite .    in this paper , we are going to study higher - dimensional gyratons in the kundt family in detail , generalizing thus our results obtained in @xcite to the case of direct - product background spacetimes of arbitrary dimensions .    in order to find sufficiently general direct - product spacetimes one need to include an additional background electromagnetic field .",
    "therefore , we first solve the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations for such backgrounds .",
    "when we subsequently add a null matter source with angular momenta to the system , both the metric and the electromagnetic field is deformed so that the structure of the spacetime will not be of a direct - product type anymore .",
    "it is thus a highly nontrivial fact that the complete nonlinear einstein  maxwell equations can still be reduced to a set of linear differential equations formulated on the background transverse space .",
    "the nonlinearity boils down to the nonlinear dependence of the sources on the right - hand sides of the nonhomogeneous differential equations for the rotational components @xmath6 and @xmath7 of the electromagnetic field and the metric , respectively . as a result , we are able to express explicitly the corresponding exact solutions of the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations coupled to the gyratonic matter in terms of the well - known green functions .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows .",
    "the following section briefly reviews the geometrical construction of a general kundt metric in any dimension and introduces its naturally adapted coordinates and matter content . in sec .",
    "[ sc : trsp ] an important method of splitting geometrical quantities into the temporal and transverse directions is introduced .",

    "we explicitly decouple the field equations for spacetimes with a vanishing magnetic field , and also for gyratons on direct - product background spacetimes with uniform electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the character and significance of these backgrounds is discussed .",
    "the paper concludes with a short summary and appendix  [ apx : gauge ] describing the gauge freedom of the kundt metric parametrization .",
    "the kundt class consists of spacetimes which admit a _ nontwisting , nonexpanding , and shear - free geodesic congruence _ generated by a null vector field @xmath9 .",
    "this field  @xmath10 also generates a family of null hypersufaces which forms a foliation @xmath11 of the whole spacetime .",
    "each of these @xmath12-dimensional null hypersurfaces can further be foliated by @xmath8-dimensional spatial _",
    "transverse spaces_.    in the present work we restrict our attention to a specific subclass of the general kundt family .",
    "namely , we assume that the 2-spaces of vectors orthogonal to the transverse spaces are _ integrable _ ( see below for more technical details ) .    under these geometric assumptions",
    "the spacetime metric @xmath13 can be written in the form , e.g. , @xmath14 .",
    "we use the standard convention for the wedge product @xmath15 .",
    "analogously , we denote by ` @xmath16 ' the symmetrical tensor product , for example , @xmath17 .",
    "equivalent expressions for nontrivial metric components @xmath18 are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the components @xmath23 of the inverse metric are thus @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a scalar function , @xmath30 is a transverse 1-form , which we will call the _",
    "metric 1-form _ , and @xmath31 is the _ transverse metric _ , metric on the transverse space .    to distinguish the spacetime quantities from those in the riemannian transverse space we use the superscript ` @xmath32 ' on the left of spacetime objects or operations .",
    "for example , ` @xmath33 ' is the spacetime gradient and external derivative , and ` @xmath34 ' denotes the spacetime covariant derivative associated with the metric @xmath13 .",
    "let us briefly comment on the geometrical meaning of the coordinates and other quantities introduced in the metric  .",
    "the coordinate @xmath35 is adjusted to the null foliation @xmath11 .",
    "we denote @xmath36 the specific hypersurface of this foliation corresponding to a given constant value of  @xmath35 .",
    "the null generator @xmath10 is tangent to @xmath11 , and it is normalized in accordance with the @xmath35-coordinate as ' denotes the contraction , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , @xmath38 . we use the greek letters for spacetime indices , and the latin letters for transverse - space indices . the flat symbol ` @xmath39 ' indicates lowering of the tensor indices using the spacetime metric @xmath13 .",
    "since we will also use the transverse metric @xmath31 for raising and lowering of indices , we denote such spacetime operation explicitly . ]",
    "@xmath40 the corresponding nontwisting null congruence is automatically geodesic ( @xmath41 ) and we use its affine parameter as another coordinate @xmath42 , i.e. , we assume @xmath43    intersections of the hypersurfaces @xmath44 with @xmath36 form exactly the above mentioned @xmath8-dimensional transverse spaces , which we denote @xmath45 .",
    "we assume that these spaces are mutually diffeomorphic , at least in some domain of the spacetime ( the situation could be more complicated , e.g. , in the presence of various `` black objects '' ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to identify all the spaces @xmath45 with one _ typical transverse space  @xmath46_. the space @xmath46 should be understood as a separate riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath47 with metric  @xmath31 which , for each values of @xmath35 and @xmath42 , is embedded into the full kundt spacetime as @xmath45 .    to establish such an embedding explicitly we have to identify the related points in all the transverse spaces @xmath45 which have different values of  @xmath35 and  @xmath42 . for a fixed  @xmath35 and different values of @xmath42",
    "it is natural to identify the points along the orbits of the congruence @xmath10 . for different values of  @xmath35",
    ", one has to introduce an additional flow in the which preserves the transverse foliation @xmath46 , and also commutes with the flow along the privileged null congruence  @xmath10 .",

    "any of these temporal surfaces intersects each spatial transverse space @xmath45 in a single point .",
    "we identify points which belong to the same temporal surface , and map them into one point of the typical transverse space @xmath46 . we denote the temporal surface corresponding to a point @xmath51 as  @xmath52 .",
    "the temporal foliation @xmath50 allows us also to identify tensors tangent to the typical transverse space @xmath46 with those spacetime tensors which are trivial on the temporal surfaces . for brevity ,",
    "we call them _ transverse tensors _ ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ sc : trsp ] ) .",
    "the transverse spaces @xmath45 can thus be understood as an embedding of the typical transverse space @xmath46 into the kundt spacetime .",
    "the transverse metric  @xmath31 can be viewed as a pullback of the spacetime metric  @xmath13 into this transverse space .",
    "the fact that the congruence  @xmath10 is nonexpanding and shear - free implies that the transverse part of the metric is conserved along  @xmath10 ( @xmath53 ) , which means that @xmath31 is @xmath42-independent .    explicit identification of the different transverse spaces @xmath45 can be obtained by a convenient choice of the remaining @xmath47 spatial coordinates @xmath54 : they can be chosen to be _ constant along the temporal surfaces _ @xmath55 .",
    "with such a natural choice of the adjusted coordinates , the vector fields @xmath10 and @xmath48 become the coordinate fields @xmath56 also , in these coordinates , the transverse tensors have their @xmath42 and @xmath35 components vanishing .",
    "we may also introduce the _ ` temporal ' derivatives _ of a quantity @xmath57 along @xmath10 and  @xmath48 : @xmath58 when restricted to the typical transverse space @xmath46 , these turn out to be just derivatives with respect to the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath35 , respectively .    of course , the splitting of the spacetime into the transverse spaces @xmath45 and the temporal surfaces @xmath52 is not canonically given by the kundt geometry .",
    "one can choose a different affine coordinate @xmath42 which defines the transverse spaces . or , one can change the flow @xmath48 which identifies the temporal surfaces .",
    "these gauge freedoms are shortly discussed in appendix  [ apx : gauge ] .",
    "the form of the metric indicates that the temporal surfaces @xmath52 are not orthogonal to the transverse spaces @xmath45 .",
    "the non - orthogonality is encoded in the metric 1-form @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , this property can depend on a particular choice of the gauge . in this paper",

    "this is a technical form of our final ` integrability ' assumption concerning the geometry , mentioned above equation .    to summarize , the spacetime metric @xmath13 of is naturally split into the transverse objects @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 on  @xmath46 .",

    "the ` uniformity ' requirement will be discussed after the field equations are formulated , cf .",
    "[ sc : disc ] and [ sc : solvable ] , specifically equations , .",
    "the alignment condition we impose reads that the congruence @xmath10 is an eigenvector of the maxwell tensor @xmath61 : @xmath62 consequently , the maxwell 2-form @xmath61 has the form @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a transverse and @xmath65 is a transverse .",
    "we interpret the first term as an electric part of the field , and @xmath65 as a ( transverse ) magnetic part , although such an interpretation is not straightforward due to the character of the temporal surfaces @xmath52 and @xmath8-dimensional character of the transverse spaces  @xmath45 .",

    "it is described phenomenologically by the stress - energy tensor @xmath91 with the scalar energy density @xmath92 , and the spinning part given by the transverse 1-form @xmath93 .",
    "clearly , for @xmath94 we obtain standard null fluid moving along the null direction  @xmath10 .",
    "we do not specify the field equation of the gyratonic matter , except that we assume its local stress - energy conservation @xmath95 in indices this reads @xmath96 .",
    "in the next section , we will formulate the field equations purely in terms of quantities on the transverse space @xmath46 .",
    "we have already mentioned that the transverse tensors can be viewed in two closely related ways .",
    "naturally , these are the quantities from tangent tensor space of the typical transverse space @xmath46 , which may depend on two additional parameters @xmath35 and @xmath42 .",
    "alternatively , they can be understood as _ spacetime tensors _ which are tangent to the embedded transverse spaces @xmath45 and which vanish in directions of the temporal surfaces @xmath52 .",
    "they can be defined using the projector  @xmath97 onto the transverse space @xmath98 r -w^\\mu \\stgrad[\\nu ] u\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the identity spacetime tensor with components @xmath100 .",
    "this projector leaves unchanged the vectors tangent to @xmath45 and also the 1-forms which annihilate vectors tangent to the temporal surfaces @xmath52 .",
    "equivalently , it annihilates the vectors @xmath10 and @xmath48 spanning @xmath52 , and the 1-forms @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in the adjusted",
    "coordinates @xmath103 such a projection simply cancels all the @xmath35 and @xmath42 tensor components , while leaving the transverse components unchanged .    in the former approach we use the latin tensor indices . in the spacetime picture",
    "we use the greek tensor indices even for the transverse tensors because in generic coordinates all components could be nontrivial . only in the adjusted",
    "coordinates all the @xmath35 and @xmath42 components of the transverse tensors vanish .",
    "therefore , in such coordinates , the expressions containing just the transverse tensors can be easily transformed to the corresponding expressions on @xmath46 just by switching from the greek indices to the latin ones .",
    "for example , for the transverse 2-form @xmath65 its scalar square can be written using only the transverse indices as @xmath104 , while the tensorial square becomes @xmath105 .",
    "the spaces of transverse tensors understood as quantities in full spacetime depend , in general , on a particular choice of gauge .",
    "contrary , the tangent space of the typical transverse manifold @xmath46 is gauge independent .",
    "clearly , the identification of these two pictures ( induced by the embedding @xmath106 ) is gauge - dependent .",
    "this dichotomy is the reason why it is useful to keep both these views of the transverse objects .",
    "the field equations will be naturally expressed in the language of quantities on the typical transverse space  @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the splitting of spacetime objects and properties of gauge transformations are easier to study employing the spacetime picture .    to reduce a general spacetime tensor to the transverse space @xmath46 , first we have to split it into its temporal and transverse parts . for that",
    ", we construct all its temporal projections on the vectors @xmath10 , @xmath48 and the 1-forms @xmath101 , @xmath102 , as well as the transverse projections using the projector  @xmath97 . in the notation without components we indicate each transverse projection using the symbol ` @xmath107 ' at the position of the projected index .",

    "the metric of such spacetimes is given by the sum of a homogeneous lorentzian on @xmath50 with a homogeneous riemannian on @xmath46 .",
    "depending on the signs of the curvatures of these components this yields vacuum ( anti-)nariai and minkowski , or electrovacuum bertotti  robinson and plebaski  hacyan spacetimes . the waves and gyratons on these backgrounds",
    "were discussed in detail in our previous work @xcite .",
    "we observe that the higher - dimensional case studied here generalizes these spacetimes in two natural ways : ( i ) it represents a direct - product spacetime with one 2-dimensional homogeneous lorentzian component and one riemannian component of a general dimension @xmath415 with the einstein geometry and vanishing magnetic field .",
    "( ii ) it is a direct - product spacetime composed from one lorentzian and several riemannian 2-dimensional homogeneous components with independent uniform magnetic fields associated with each of the spatial component . of course , we also admit a straightforward combination of both these cases .",
    "notice that the case ( i ) generalizes the particular forms of ( anti-)narai and bertotti  robinson spacetimes discussed in @xcite where @xmath416 , @xmath417 , or @xmath418 .    inspecting relation",
    "we find that the gaussian curvatures @xmath341 of the spatial 2-dimensional components @xmath320 must be greater or equal then the gaussian curvature @xmath234 of the temporal surface @xmath50 .",
    "they are equal to @xmath234 if , and only if , the electric field @xmath81 and the corresponding magnetic component @xmath330 vanish simultaneously .",
    "the richest family of spacetimes is thus obtained if the temporal surface has the anti - de  sitter geometry , @xmath265 .",
    "in such a case the spatial components can be either spheres @xmath344 , planes @xmath345 , or hyperbolic planes @xmath346 . for the flat temporal surface , @xmath260 , all spatial components must be spheres @xmath344 , except the case in which the electric and magnetic fields are missing , implying flat spatial components .",
    "indeed , for @xmath260 , all the spatial gaussian curvatures read @xmath419 . finally , for the de  sitter temporal surface , @xmath263 , the spatial components must be spheres .",
    "recall that in any dimension @xmath420 these direct - product spacetimes are of algebraic type d or are conformally flat , cf .  .",
    "an important subcase is obtained when the dimension @xmath415 is even , the exceptional zeroth component is missing , and all @xmath421 components of the background magnetic field are the same , @xmath422 with the constant @xmath423 given by @xmath424 .",
    "in such a case @xmath425 .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath65 can thus be renormalized to become a khler 2-form @xmath144 , @xmath426 compatible with the transverse metric @xmath31 given by .",
    "indeed , thanks to equation and the fact that @xmath427 , the 2-form @xmath144 equips the transverse space @xmath46 not only with an almost khler structure but also with the khler structure .",
    "notice , that the assumption implies that the trace - free stress - energy tensor vanishes , @xmath428 such a condition thus guarantees a considerable simplification of the transverse part of the einstein equations , even without assuming the direct - product structure of the transverse manifold made in .",
    "moreover , the maxwell equations imply that the 2-form provides the almost khler structure for the transverse space @xmath46 .",
    "interestingly , such solutions are analogous to expanding robinson ",
    "trautman electrovacuum spacetimes in @xmath420 @xcite .",
    "it posses an interesting open question whether there exist backgrounds outside the class discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssc : dpa ] , i.e. , those without the direct - product structure , which would still satisfy the assumption and for which it would be possible to separate the remaining field equations .",
    "the main difficulty here lies in the separation of the equation for the divergent part of the metric  @xmath30 .",
    "we presented a new large class of gyraton solutions of the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations in higher dimensions , in particular the gyratons on type d or conformally flat background spacetimes which are formed as a direct product of constant - curvature 2-spaces ( and a possible additional einstein space of an arbitrary dimension in which the magnetic field vanishes ) . in four dimensions",
    "these background spacetimes involve the famous ( anti-)nariai , bertotti  robinson , and plebaski  hacyan spacetimes .",
    "the background geometries are solutions of the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations corresponding to the uniform background electric and magnetic fields .",
    "these gyraton solutions belong to the kundt family of shearfree , twistfree and nonexpanding spacetimes .",
    "gyratons describe the gravitational field created by a stress - energy tensor of a spinning ( circularly polarized ) high - frequency beam of radiation of electromagnetic , neutrino , or any other massless fields .",
    "they also provide a good approximation for the gravitational field of a beam of ultrarelativistic particles with an intrinsic spin .",
    "the gyratons generalize standard vacuum or pure radiation pp - waves or kundt waves by admitting a nonzero angular momentum of the source .",
    "this leads to nontrivial @xmath429-components of the einstein equations , in addition to the pure radiation @xmath430-component which appears for the simplest pp - waves and kundt waves .",
    "we have shown that all the einstein ",
    "maxwell equations can be solved explicitly for any distribution of such matter sources .",
    "namely , the task has been reduced to a linear problem involving scalar green functions on separate transverse components , which are typically 2-dimensional sphere , plane or hyperboloid .",

    "the authors are grateful to valeri frolov for stimulating discussions .",
    "the construction of the transverse spaces and splitting of the metric in the form is not unique .",
    "it contains three partially ambiguous choices  gauges . the choice of the coordinate @xmath35 ( @xmath214-gauge ) , the choice of the coordinate @xmath42 ( @xmath207-gauge ) , and the choice of the flow @xmath48 ( @xmath431-gauge ) .",
    "the foliation of null hypersurfaces @xmath11 defines the coordinate @xmath35 up to a reparametrization @xmath432 with one - to - one function @xmath119 of one variable .",
    "the reparametrization has to be accompanied by rescaling of @xmath10 and @xmath42 , however , the transverse foliation @xmath46 and the temporal surfaces @xmath50 are unchanged .",
    "different quantities transform as follows : @xmath433 clearly , the @xmath35-gauge changes both derivatives along @xmath10 and  @xmath48 .    the @xmath42-gauge freedom is related to the fact that the affine parameter of the geodesic generated by @xmath10 is defined up to a constant .",
    "the coordinate function @xmath42 is thus defined up to the @xmath42-independent shift : @xmath434 such a shift changes the transverse space foliation , although the typical transverse space @xmath46 is unchanged .",
    "the thus modifies the embedding @xmath435 of @xmath46 into spacetime @xmath436 .",
    "if we additionally require that the temporal foliation @xmath50 remains unchanged , we find that the change of @xmath42 has to be accompanied by : @xmath437 where @xmath438 represents the gradient on the transverse space , i.e. , only transverse components of the spacetime gradient @xmath439 .",
    "we also see that the @xmath42-gauge changes just the derivative along @xmath48 .",
    "finally , the @xmath440-gauge leaves the transverse spaces @xmath46 unchanged but changes the identification of them for different values of the coordinate @xmath35 .",
    "when restricted to the typical transverse space @xmath46 , it can be viewed as the @xmath35-dependent ( and @xmath42-independent ) family of diffeomorphisms of @xmath46 .",
    "the generator of this family of diffeomorphisms is exactly the vector field @xmath441 by which the @xmath440-gauge modifies the flow @xmath48 @xcite : @xmath442 the corresponding changes of the metric quantities are + @xmath443 as for the @xmath42-gauge , only the @xmath35-derivative is modified .",
    "it is explained in more detail in @xcite that although both the transverse spaces @xmath46 and the temporal planes @xmath50 are not determined uniquely by the spacetime geometry , the assumption @xmath59 of the existence of the temporal planes orthogonal to the transverse spaces is independent of a specific choice of the gauge , in particular of the choices of @xmath46 .",
