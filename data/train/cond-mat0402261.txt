    "a remarkable new feature associated with the physics of dust - contaminated plasmas @xcite is the existence of strongly - coupled charged matter configurations , which even lead to the formation of dusty plasma ( dp ) wigner - type layers ( crystals ) when the inter - grain potential energy far exceeds the average kinetic energy of the dust particles .",
    "dust crystals display a variety of new phenomena , such as phase transitions ( crystallization , melting ) and lattice excitations ; a link is thus established between plasma physics and solid state physics @xcite .",
    "dust lattices , which are typically formed in the sheath region in discharge experiments and remain suspended above the negative electrode due to a balance between the external electric and gravity forces @xcite , are known to support harmonic oscillations ( acoustic modes ) in both longitudinal and transverse - shear ( horizontal - plane ) directions , as well as optical - mode - like oscillations in the vertical ( off - plane ) direction @xcite .    dust - lattice waves ( dlws )",
    "are reminiscent of waves ( ` phonons ' ) propagating in atomic chains , which are long known to be dominated by interesting nonlinear phenomena ( localized modes , instabilities ) , due to the intrinsic nonlinearities of inter - atomic interaction mechanisms and/or on - site substrate potentials @xcite .",
    "the present study is devoted to the study of one such phenomenon , namely the nonlinear amplitude modulation of weakly nonlinear oscillations with respect to longitudinal lattice oscillations . even though this mechanism , which is associated with harmonic generation due to self - interaction of the carrier waves , is today known to be of relevance in phenomena as diverse as the modulational instability and energy localization in solids , charge and information transport in biomolecules and dna strands , and coherent signal transmission in electric lines and in optical pulse propagation @xcite",
    ", it has only recently been considered in dusty plasmas @xcite with regard to the propagation of dust - acoustic and dust - ion acoustic waves @xcite in a weakly - coupled ( gas - like ) dp .",
    "as far as the nonlinear modulation of dust - lattice oscillations is concerned , our knowledge is still at a very early stage , let alone some first attempts to model the modulation of longitudinal @xcite and transverse @xcite dlws .",
    "in addition to a theoretical investigation of the occurrence of modulational instability , these studies have provided a first prediction of the possible existence of localized envelope excitations in a dust - crystal .",
    "it should be stressed that , as long known and extensively studied in solid state physics , the physics of these localized modes ( basically associated with the generation of harmonics , which was recently observed experimentally ; see in ref .",

    ", we consider the amplitude modulation of longitudinal waves propagating in dp lattices .",
    "we will derive an equation governing the evolution of the dust lattice wave envelope and will then examine its stability with respect to external perturbations .",
    "explicit conditions for the formation of different types of envelope excitations will be presented , in terms of the physical parameters involved in dp crystals and , in particular , the existence of _ asymmetric _ envelope dust - lattice solitons is predicted .",
    "this study refers to the longitudinal grain motion in an ` ideal ' one  dimensional dp crystal , i.e. a single , unidimensional , infinite - sized , dust - layer of identical ( in size , charge and mass ) dust grains situated at spatially periodic sites ( at equilibrium ) .",
    "it should however be noted that real crystals formed in the laboratory are often two or three  dimensional arrays @xcite , which may host longitudinal waves such as the ones considered herein , but also transverse ( shear ) waves @xcite as well as dissipative nonlinear structures , as observed in recent experiments @xcite .",
    "two  dimensional ( 2d ) lattices are known from solid state physics to possess an enriched profile of possible excitations , including e.g. oblique ( with respect to the principal axes ) waves , 2d breathers and vortex excitations @xcite .",
    "therefore , this work is only a first step towards the investigation of nonlinear mechanisms in dp crystals : the mechanism put forward in this paper may be generalized to higher dimensionality ; nevertheless , this is left for consideration in future work .",

    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "a quantity of importance comes out to be the ratio @xmath233 : its sign dictates the type of envelope soliton which should , in principle , propagate in the lattice , while ( the square root of ) its absolute value represents a measure of the soliton amplitude @xmath234 for a given width @xmath235 , viz . @xmath236 . in figure [ figure7 ]",

    "one draws the conclusion that for a given excitation width @xmath235 ( assumed @xmath238 , according to our approximation ) , shorter wavelength ( i.e. higher wavenumber ) carrier waves will form dark  type excitations ( pulses ) with an increased maximum displacement @xmath234 ; this picture , which is true below , say , @xmath239 , is inverted above this value ( nevertheless , there may be some doubt above the validity of results in that region , as discussed above ) .",
    "also , higher values of @xmath52 , i.e. higher lattice constant @xmath2 values for a given debye length @xmath240 , seem to favor narrower excitations ( as compared to @xmath2 ) .",
    "notice , in fig .",

    "[ figure3 ] , [ figure4 ] , in fact also limit the ( @xmath250 ) parameter pair values where bright ( dark / grey ) solutions i.e. density pulses ( holes ) may exist .",
    "furthermore , the envelope characteristics will depend on the carrier wave dispersion via @xmath129 and @xmath149 ; for instance , regions with lower values of @xmath129 ( or higher values of @xmath149 ) will support narrower excitations .",
    "admittedly , however , dust lattices will rather not favor bright  type structure formation by unstable long  wavelength ldl waves . on the other hand , such waves will mostly be stable to external perturbations , and may locally form density dips ( envelope holes ) .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the amplitude modulation of longitudinal dust - lattice waves propagating in a one - dimensional dust - crystal . by using a continuum approximation ,",
    "we have derived a nonlinear schrdinger equation governing the evolution of the ldl wave envelope .",
    "we have found that long wavelength carrier waves will generally be stable , possibly evolving towards the formation of voids , i.e. asymmetric dark / grey  type coherent envelope structures , while longer wavelengths may allow for the formation of envelope pulses ( asymmetric bright  type envelope excitations ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the total grain displacement will bear a ( weak ) constant displacement ( zeroth mode ) , due to the intrinsic third  order nonlinearity of the debye potential .",
    "it may be admitted that the former ( dark ) excitations may rather not be relevant to this idealized , infinite chain model , since they correspond to an infinite amount of energy stored in the lattice .",
    "nevertheless , they may be taken as a hint towards excitations sustained in finite - length , highly discrete , real lattices .",
    "the present study aims in making a first step towards the elucidation of the nonlinear harmonic generation mechanisms dominating weakly  nonlinear longitudinal wave packets in dust - crystals .",
    "the formation of ldlw  related structures has thus been predicted , and will hopefully be confirmed by appropriately designed experiments or by numerical simulations .",
    "in fact , through the present investigation , a link has been established towards the formalism of discreteness  related intrinsic localized modes ( discrete breathers ) widely studied recently in solid state systems @xcite .",
    "this work should , in principle , be extended by including realistic effects associated with crystal asymmetries , defects , dust charging , ion - drag and multiple dust - layer coupling @xcite .",
    "in particular , one should consider a similar effect in more realistic , e.g. 2d , geometries , as the ones observed in recent experiments with laser - excited dust lattices @xcite .",
    "concluding , this work was devoted to a nonlinear mechanism for harmonic generation and coherent structure formation .",
    "although here presented in a 1d geometry , for simplicity , this qualitative mechanism may be generalized to 2d lattices ; this possibility will be considered in future work .",
