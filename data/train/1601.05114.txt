    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is a non - abelian gauge theory that describes the strong interactions between quarks and gluons . despite the fact that gluons do not carry electric charges",
    ", they have color charge . due to this fact",
    ", they can couple to each other and form bound states called glueballs which have not been detected so far , becoming itself a great qcd quest . at high energies",
    "the qcd coupling is small and perturbative methods work well . at low energies where bound states form ( hadronization )",
    "qcd coupling is large and perturbative methods fail .",
    "various current studies deal with glueball issues from both experimental and theoretical points of view @xcite . on",
    "the theoretical side one can see several approaches such as lattice qcd , the flux tube model , mit bag model , coulomb gauge model and qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "there is also a novel approach based on holography or ads / cft or anti de sitter / conformal field theory correspondence @xcite to circumvent the difficulty of non - perturbative qcd at low energies .",
    "motivated by last ten years of efforts based on ads / cft correspondence to investigate glueball states @xcite the main objective of this work is to calculate the masses for both even and odd spin glueballs and obtain the regge trajectories related to the pomeron and the odderon .",
    "we use a dynamical holographic model , taking into account dynamical corrections to the anti de sitter ( ads ) space metric due to a quadratic dilaton field .",
    "this is the first calculation of high spin glueballs @xmath2 with a dynamical model .",
    "this allows us to solve open some questions on the regge trajectories for the pomeron and the odderon .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence or duality is a powerful tool to tackle non - perturbative yang - mill theories .",
    "this duality relates a conformal yang - mills theory with the symmetry group @xmath3 for very large @xmath4 and extended supersymmetry @xmath5 with a @xmath6 superstring theory in a curved space , known as anti de sitter space , or @xmath7 . at low energies string theory",
    "is represented by an effective supergravity theory , due to this reason the ads / cft is also known by gauge / gravity duality .    after breaking the conformal symmetry one can build phenomenological models that describe",
    "approximately qcd . these models are known as ads / qcd models .    in order to deal with conformal symmetry breaking the works @xcite have done some important progress with this issue . in these works , emerged the idea of the hardwall model , which meant that a hard cutoff was introduced at a certain value @xmath8 of the holographic coordinate @xmath9 and it was considered a slice of @xmath10 space in the region @xmath11 .    another holographic model to break the conformal invariance in the boundary theory , and make it an effective theory of qcd , is called the softwall model ( swm ) .",
    "this model introduces an exponential factor in the action related to a dilatonic filed that represents a soft ir cutoff .",
    "the swm was proposed in @xcite to study vector mesons , and subsequently extended to glueballs @xcite .",
    "one interesting property of the swm is to provide linear regge trajectories . in the ref . @xcite it was shown that swm does not work properly for calculation of scalar glueball and its radial excitation masses or higher spin glueball states . due to this",
    ", one can not find satisfactory regge trajectories for glueballs from the swm consistent with the literature .    in this work , our principal aim is to calculate regge trajectories for both even and odd higher spin glueballs using a dynamical version of the swm , i.e , imposing that the dilaton field became dynamical satisfying the einstein equations in five dimensions @xcite .",
    "the regge trajectories obtained for both even and odd spin glueballs , related to the pomeron and the odderon , respectively , are in good agreement with available data .",
    "the holographic dynamical softwall ( dsw ) model that we are going to consider has a metric structure which is consistently solved from einstein s equation . to obtain the metric solution we write a @xmath12 action for the graviton - dilaton coupling in the string frame : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the newton s constant in five dimensions , the dilaton field @xmath15 is given by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the dilatonic potential .",
    "the metric tensor in 5-dimensional space has the following form @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 diag @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "all of these parameters are in the string frame .",
    "the precise form of the metric will be defined solving the equations of motion and finding explicitly the expression for @xmath24 .",
    "actually , it is easier to solve this problem in the einstein frame .    performing a weyl rescaling , from the string frame to the einstein frame , such that @xmath25 and @xmath26",
    ", one can rewrite the action ( [ acao_corda ] ) as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 . varying this action",
    ", one can obtain the equations of motion : @xmath29 solving these equations for the quadratic dilaton @xmath16 , one finds : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ads radius .",

    "correspond to a discrete spectrum of @xmath34 masses with the identification @xmath43 .",
    "this equation was solved numerically in @xcite for the scalar glueball @xmath44 and its radial ( spin 0 ) excitations and the masses found are compatible with those from lattice qcd .    from the ads",
    "/ cft dictionary one knows how to relate the operator in the super yang - mills theory with fields in the @xmath45 space . in the case of dual higher spin fields we consider a symmetric traceless spin @xmath46 field and the relation between the conformal dimension @xmath47 and the ads mass is @xmath48 and the effective potential reads @xmath49",
    "in the perturbative approach , the pomeron is identified with the leading twist 2 trajectory @xmath50 ( see , e. g. , @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "note that for twist two operator the relation gives @xmath51 as shown in @xcite .",
    "so , let us start this study with this assumption . using the dsw model discussed in the previous section ,",
    "one obtains complex masses for the glueball states @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath52 which does not allow us to find a regge trajectory for the pomeron",
    ". however , in the non - perturbative regime higher twist operators also contribute to the scattering amplitudes related to the pomeron @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref . @xcite it was argued that the glueball state 0@xmath53 does not belong to the pomeron trajectory , but to another one with lower intercept .",
    "this does not agree with @xcite where the 0@xmath53 state is taken into account to the pomeron trajectory . in order to investigate these problems",
    ", we are going to consider trajectories including and excluding the 0@xmath53 state and with higher twist .",
    "so now we consider twist four operators for a pure super yang - mills theory defined on the 4d boundary , such that @xmath54 and compute the masses for even glueball states using eqs . and .",
    "the scalar glueball state @xmath44 is represented by the operator @xmath55 , and it can be written as @xmath56 . for higher spin glueballs we insert symmetrized covariant derivatives in a given operator with spin in order to raise the total angular momentum .",
    "then , one obtains @xmath57 , with conformal dimension @xmath58 and spin @xmath46 .    to calculate the masses for the higher spin glueball states and get the regge trajectory related to the pomeron",
    ", one has to solve the eq .",
    "( [ equ_7_new1 ] ) numerically with the effective potential .",
    "the masses found are shown in table [ t1 ] .",

    "( [ equ_7_new1 ] ) with the potential ( [ ve ] ) for @xmath61 gev@xmath62 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     regge trajectories for the odderon can be obtained using data from table [ t2 ] since they are associated with odd spin glueballs .    for the odderon ,",
    "using table [ t2 ] and @xmath61 gev@xmath62 , excluding the state @xmath63 , the regge trajectory is presented bellow : @xmath64 the errors come from the linear fit .",
    "this reege trajectory for the odderon is represented in figure [ dswodderon ] ( left panel ) and is in agreement with @xcite within the non - relativistic constituent model .",
    "choosing another set of states , for exemple , @xmath65 , from table [ t2 ] also with @xmath66 = 0.10 gev@xmath62 , one finds the following regge trajectory : @xmath67 which is compatible with @xcite within the relativistic many - body model .",
    "this reege trajectory for the odderon is represented in figure [ dswodderon ] ( right panel ) and the errors also come from the linear fit .    another set with @xmath68 , from table [ t2 ]",
    "also with @xmath66 = 0.10 gev@xmath62 gives @xmath69 which is compatible with the non - relativistic constituent model @xcite and excludes the state @xmath70 .",
    "figure [ plot3 ] ( left panel ) represents the effective potentials in the dsw model for various odd spin glueball states . for comparison ,",
    "we show in figure [ plot3 ] ( right panel ) the corresponding effective potentials for the usual swm extended for high spins @xcite .",
    "these effective potentials also increase fast for small @xmath9 , but they increase slowly for large @xmath9 , in contrast with the holographic dynamical model shown in figure [ plot3 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "we used a dynamical holographic softwall model to obtain even and odd spin glueball mass spectra and achieve the related regge trajectories associated with the pomeron and the odderon , respectively .",
    "these trajectories are in good agreement with those found in @xcite . besides , this is the first obtention of these regge trajectories through a dynamical model .    in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that the swm could not lead to the expected regge trajectories for the pomeron or the odderon .",
    "this problem is overcome in this work by the use of the dsw model .",
    "the masses obtained in this work can be compared with the ones coming from some phenomenological models .",
    "first , the masses found here from the dsw model are higher than those found from the swm @xcite , if one chooses the same value of the free parameter @xmath66 .",
    "this fact can be understood comparing the plots @xmath71 for these two models .",
    "figures [ plot1 ] and [ plot3 ] ( both left panels ) represent the effective potential for the dsw model for some even and odd spin glueball states while figures [ plot1 ] and [ plot3 ] ( both right panels ) represent the corresponding potentials for the softwall model . since the minima of the effective potentials for the dsw model are higher than those of the swm , the corresponding masses eigenstates for the dsw model are higher then those from the swm .",
    "second , the masses found from the dsw model are similar to those found in refs .",
    "@xcite within the holographic hardwall model .",
    "this fact can be understood also comparing figures [ plot1 ] and [ plot3 ] ( left panels ) for the dsw model with figures [ plot1 ] and [ plot3 ] ( right panels ) for the swm .",
    "one can see that in figures [ plot1 ] and [ plot3 ] ( let panels ) the effective potentials increase with larger slopes for each spin than those in figures [ plot1 ] and [ plot3 ] ( right panels ) .",
    "this means that the dynamical corrections of the swm produce barriers for the effective potential similar to those of the phenomenological hardwall model .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the state @xmath44 does not belong to the pomeron s regge trajectory .",
    "our results on the regge trajectories for the pomeron , showed in eqs .",
    "( [ rpsd ] ) and ( [ rpszsd ] ) are not conclusive in this regard . in eq .",
    "( [ rpsd ] ) we obtain a regge trajectory for the pomeron including the state @xmath44 which is agreement with @xcite and @xcite . on the other side , in eq .",
    "( [ rpszsd ] ) we obtain a regge trajectory for the pomeron excluding the state @xmath44 which is also compatible with experimental data @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this is our best fit for the pomeron trajectory .    in the case of the odderon , different regge trajectories were found in @xcite corresponding to a relativistic and a non - relativistic models .",
    "we found compatible results within the dsw model for both the relativistic and non - relativistic predictions for the odderon as presented in @xcite . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the state @xmath70 should not belong to the odderon regge trajectory .",
    "this conclusion is not supported by our results with the dsw model for the exclusion of the @xmath70 state , since we found good trajectories for the odderon with and without the glueball state @xmath70 .        c.  f.  qiao and l.  tang , phys .",
