    "relativistic jets accelerated from compact objects , such as neutron stars or black holes , are suspected to produce many of the observational signatures associated with high energy phenomena .",
    "objects thought to produce them include radio galaxies and quasars @xcite , microquasars @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "an important difference between jets of gamma ray bursts and the better studied radio jets of quasars or microquasars is that active quasars inject energy over extended periods of time into the jet while gamma ray burst sources are impulsive .",
    "therefore , quasar jets remain highly collimated throughout their lifetimes , while gamma ray burst jets decelerate and expand significantly once they become non relativistic @xcite .",
    "recent observations of the swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328a event @xcite and of the swift j2058.4 + 0516 event @xcite have been interpreted @xcite as evidence that relativistic jets can be triggered in quiescent massive black holes when an orbiting sun - like star , owing to the cumulative effect of encounters with other stars @xcite , gets too close to the black hole and is tidally disrupted .    because the duration of the event is determined by the timescale at which the most bound material returns to pericenter forming an accretion disk @xcite , flaring black hole candidates in nearby galaxies offer the possibility of watching the evolution of a quasar - like object through many stages of its life in a time span of few months or years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than waiting the millions of years necessary to observe changes in extragalactic objects .",
    "much of our effort in this paper is therefore dedicated to study the dynamics of jets triggered by tidal disruption .",
    "some of the questions at the forefront of our attention include the effects of the external medium and the degree to which the jet dynamics are modified by their energy injection histories .",
    "because the mass accretion rate onto a black hole that is fed by tidal disruption is far from being steady and there is not a simple prescription for the surrounding density stratification , self - similar solutions fail to provide an accurate description of the jet dynamics , and thus simulations are required .",
    "the mass accretion history onto the black hole as well as the jet lifetime are calculated in section [ sec : rates ] using detailed hydrodynamical simulations of the tidal disruption of sun - like stars .",
    "the character of the external medium responsible for shaping the evolution and morphology of the jets is reviewed in section [ sec : medium ] .",
    "detailed hydrodynamic calculations of the evolution of jets triggered by tidal disruption are presented in section [ sec : jet ] , together with a brief description of the numerical methods and the initial model . finally , a tidal disruption model for the swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328a event is presented in section [ sec : discussion ] , followed by a discussion on how the discovery of flaring candidates in nearby galaxies by _ swift _ will help elucidate the demography of the dormant black hole population .",
    "our formalism for calculating the rate of mass return to the black hole @xmath2 after the disruption is identical to the method presented in @xcite , except for the initial conditions where we take the star to be a 1 @xmath3 star described by a polytropic index @xmath4 and an adiabatic equation of state with @xmath5 .",
    "our disruption simulations are performed using the flash hydrodynamics framework @xcite , which includes an adaptive mesh refinement scheme that permits the wide range of scales necessary to resolve the star and the debris streams simultaneously . during the disruption ,",
    "the debris tails are adaptively refined based on their density relative to the maximum density in the simulation @xmath6 at each time step , with a cutoff density for the lowest refinement level of @xmath7 times the maximum density .",
    "all matter with @xmath8 is refined to the highest level .",
    "the disruption is performed in a box that is several orders of magnitude larger than the initial star s radius of @xmath9 , which is done to facilitate tracking of the tidal debris over long enough timescales for hydrodynamical effects to no longer play a major role in determining the distribution of mass as a function of binding energy .       to the black hole following a @xmath11 encounter , displayed as solid lines of decreasing thickness for increasing @xmath12 . as",
    "the time of the encounter is independent of @xmath12 at constant @xmath13 , and the forces experienced along the trajectory are nearly identical , the rate of mass return simply scales with the spread of binding energy across the debris , @xmath14 .",
    "the feeding rate rapidly converges to the predicted @xmath0 power law , as shown by the short dotted line segment .",
    "dashed lines show the eddington feeding limit @xmath15 as a function of @xmath12 , assuming an efficiency @xmath16 . the larger the mass of the black hole , the shorter the amount of time the black hole remains above a given @xmath17 .",
    "a disruption of a @xmath18 star by a @xmath19 black hole never exceeds the eddington limit . ]    to calculate the rate of mass return to the black hole @xmath2 as a function of the black hole mass @xmath12 , we performed a single simulation of the disruption of a 1 @xmath3 star by a @xmath20 black hole with impact parameter @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the tidal and the periastron radius , respectively ( see figure [ fig : tidaldis ] ) .",
    "this encounter is deep enough to leave no surviving core @xcite . to accurately model the disruption ,",
    "we perform the simulation using a cubical volume with a basic grid of @xmath24 cells ( along each cartesian coordinate axis ) , with a width of @xmath25 cm , and 16 levels of refinement , resulting in the initial diameter ( @xmath26 ) of the star being resolved by 90 grid cells .",
    "the shape of @xmath2 in the newtonian approximation for full disruptions is only affected by the degree of symmetry in the tides @xcite and the star s initial density profile @xcite . as shown in @xcite , tides are very symmetrical for black holes with @xmath27 , with the maximum force difference between the near- and far - side of the star being 6% for a @xmath11 encounter involving a @xmath28 , and even less for black holes of larger mass . assuming that the shape of @xmath2 does not vary for black holes of mass @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be related to our benchmark simulation via @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the times since disruption for a black hole of mass @xmath12 and our benchmark simulation , respectively @xcite .",
    "our simulation assumes that the typical disrupted star has a structure similar to that of the sun , but stars of different masses and ages can have different degrees of central concentrations @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that for full disruptions the star s initial density profile primarily affects @xmath2 at early times , but that all reasonable initial stellar profiles eventually lead to a power - law decay where @xmath34 at late times .",
    "therefore , we assume that a typical disruption of a 1 @xmath3 by a black hole of mass @xmath35 can be reasonably modeled by a single simulation using the above scalings , which yields the @xmath2 shown in figure [ fig : dmdedens ]",
    ".          the returning gas does not immediately produce a flare of activity from the black hole .",
    "first material must enter quasi - circular orbits and form an accretion torus @xcite",
    ". only then will viscous effects release enough binding energy to power a flare .",
    "once the torus is formed , it will evolve under the influence of viscosity and radiative cooling , although the viscosity would have to be implausibly low ( i.e. the usual viscosity dissipation time @xmath36 for a thick disk would be @xmath37 ) for the bulk of the mass to be stored for longer than @xmath38 in a reservoir at @xmath39 .",
    "after @xmath40 the mass accretion rate would continue to fade as @xmath2 .",
    "little is known about the relation between jet production in supermassive accreting black holes and the state of their constituent accretion disks .",
    "however , an association between hot thick accretion flow with the strongest jets , as observed in binary black holes , is expected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is the poloidal field protruding from the disk that is thought to drive the jet and because its strength increases with disk thickness , jets are expected to be stronger in thick disks than in thin ones @xcite . in gx 339 - 4 , for example , a jet is produced when the x - ray source is in the low / hard state . in this state ,",
    "the disk temperature is @xmath41k , suggesting a thick disk . on the other hand , when the source enters the high / soft state ( with a thin @xmath42 k disk )",
    "the jet radio emission disappears to a level at least tens of times weaker @xcite . in what follows",
    ", we make the assumption that jets will be produced only when the accretion disk is geometrically thick and hot .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : mdottime ] that most of the debris would be fed to the black hole far more rapidly than it could be accepted if the radiative efficiency was high . as the disk material advects onto black hole",

    "after emerging from the optically thick envelope , the jet is believed to move into a medium whose properties are primarily determined by the emanating stellar outflows within the nuclear cluster ( region @xmath46 ) .",
    "a jet emerging from the dense stellar core may pass through a region of steadily decreasing ambient pressure for up to several tens of parsecs ( region @xmath47 ) .",
    "jet material travels along a channel of its own making . the speed with which the head of the channel advances into the surrounding medium",
    "is obtained by balancing the momentum flux in the jet against the momentum flux of the surrounding medium . a continuous flow of relativistic fluid supplies this region with mass , momentum , energy , and magnetic flux for as long as @xmath48 .",
    "information about a sizable decrease in power supply propagates into the jet at the internal sound speed ( for @xmath49 ) , reaching the head when the jet has traveled a further distance @xmath50 .",

    "with the exception of our own galactic center and m31 where there are observational constraints on the extent of the confining gas on scales @xmath51 pc within the nucleus @xcite , little is known about the character of the medium surrounding black holes in the cores of inactive galaxies .",
    "we can thus place only somewhat model - dependent limits on the surrounding density and pressure structures .",
    "the jet s advancement would be initially impeded near @xmath22 , where the returning bound material forms a nearly hydrostatic envelope around the black hole @xcite , within which radiation pressure is dominant ( region @xmath45 in figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "after the jet has broken free from the optically thick envelope , it passes through an extended region of steadily decreasing ambient pressure , whose properties are primarily shaped by stellar wind collisions within the dense core ( region @xmath46 in figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "the most rapid drop in pressure probably occurs outside the dense core ( region @xmath47 in figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) , where mass whose gravitational field confines the ambient gas is likely to have an extended distribution , but with density rapidly decreasing outwards .",
    "an understanding of the structure and evolution of jets triggered by tidal disruption can come only through knowledge of the properties of the material through which they propagate .",

    "their results , used as initial conditions in section [ sec : jet ] , are briefly described here . during the tidal disruption process , about half of the stellar material escapes on hyperbolic orbits with speeds @xmath54 km / s , while the rest falls back onto the black hole .",
    "the bound gas , after pericenter passage , is on orbits which collide with the infalling stream near the original orbital plane at apocenter , giving rise to a shock which redistributes angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the debris raining down would , after little more than its free - fall time , settle into a disk surrounded by a radiation - dominated envelope , whose inner radius is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the structure of such an envelope is simplified by the fact that a fully ionized gas dominated by thomson opacity and radiation pressure tends to approach a uniform entropy state .",
    "assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and an equation of state dominated by radiation pressure ( @xmath58 ) , the density stratification in the optically thick envelope can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fraction of stellar material in the envelope and @xmath61 is the radius at which the envelope becomes optically thin , which for electron scattering opacity is given by @xmath62 the density distribution derived in equation ( [ eq : rho_ext ] ) is probably valid only at late times ( @xmath63 ) , as the returning gas does not immediately produce a thick disk of radiation - dominated gas .",

    "as expected , the flow is driven out by the aggregate influence of the stellar winds while interior to the cluster the gas is captured and accreted onto the central black hole .",
    "the stagnation radius , the boundary where the flow is divided between inflowing and outflowing , increases with the mass of the central black hole . as can be seen from figures [ fig : mhden ] and [ fig : mhdeneta ] , the density stratification is strongly dependent on the black hole mass but nearly independent on the power - law assumed for the distribution of the mass injection ( i.e. @xmath85 ) .",
    "the density distribution at small radii can be roughly described by @xmath92 with @xmath93 for @xmath94 respectively . in the outer regions ,",

    "realistically , we would expect the ambient medium around the supermassive black hole to have a complex multiphase structure as inferred from models of the line - emitting region @xcite .",

    "let us consider a cylindrically symmetric , relativistic jet moving through a stratified medium .",
    "as long as the flow is continuously injected , the head of the jet ( or working surface ) will have a double shock structure , composed by a forward and a reverse shock where , in the system of reference where the contact discontinuity is at rest , the ambient medium and the jet material respectively are decelerated and heated , transforming kinetic into thermal energy .",
    "the speed @xmath96 with which the head of the channel advances into the surrounding medium is obtained by balancing the momentum flux in the shocked jet material against that of the shocked surrounding medium , measured in the frame comoving with the advancing head ( e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 are the mass density , specific enthalpy , lorentz factor and pressure of the jet and ambient medium respectively , and @xmath102 is the velocity of the jet and the advancing head ( where @xmath103 is the proper fluid velocity and @xmath104 ) . if @xmath96 is supersonic with respect to the ambient gas , @xmath105 can be neglected and equation ( [ eq : vel ] ) gives @xmath106^{-1}.\\ ] ] the resulting flow pattern will depend crucially upon the jet mach number and the density ratio between the jet and the given ambient medium . when the jet density significantly exceeds the ambient density , @xmath107 .",
    "a relativistic jet emerging from the galactic core will pass through a region of steadily decreasing ambient density for up to several tens of parsecs ( figure [ fig : diagram ] ) .",
    "even if the jet is confined , this decrement in density will result in an increase in cross section , and the degree of collimation @xmath108 will either decrease or increase , depending on whether the size of the evacuated channel @xmath109 increases more or less rapidly than @xmath77 .",
    "this indicates that the dynamics of the expanding jet is expected to be modified by changes in collimation and can not be properly captured by spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "these difficulties motivate consideration of the hydrodynamical confinement in axisymmetric numerical calculations , to which we now turn our attention .          the propagation of relativistic jets triggered by the tidal disruption of stars in quiescent supermassive black holes is studied here by using the adaptive mesh refinement code _",

    "the luminosity of the jet is assumed here to follow the mass accretion rate , @xmath114 .",
    "this relation together with mass conservation determines the density of the jet , @xmath115 , at the injection boundary .",
    "given the large range in scales , the propagation of the jet in the optically thick envelope ( @xmath116 ) and its subsequent expansion through the medium shaped by the interaction of massive stellar winds ( @xmath117 ) are studied separately .",
    "the existence of a steady , spherical , optically thick envelope around the black hole should be regarded as an extreme assumption as its extension and structure will be modulated at a variable rate by fallback .",
    "the envelope starts to form when the most tightly bound debris fall back .",
    "our stellar disruption simulation ( section [ sec : rates ] ) shows that the first material returns at a time @xmath69 , with an infall rate of about @xmath118 ( figure [ fig : dmdedens ] ) .",
    "the infall rates are expected to increase , relatively steadily , for at least tens of orbital periods , before the majority of the bound material rains down at @xmath119 .",
    "once the envelope is formed , it will evolve under the influence of viscosity , radiatively cooling and time dependent mass injection from both the jetted outflow and the angular momentum redistribution region .    to study the evolution of the relativistic jet in the optically thick region , we assume , for simplicity , the envelope to be fully formed ( @xmath120 ) and accurately described by the steady , spherical hydrostatic solutions presented in section [ sec : env ] .",
    "in addition , since the jet head breaks out of the envelope after only a time @xmath121 , the jet power is assumed to be steady during this phase with @xmath122 .",
    "snapshots of detailed hydrodynamic simulations of the evolution of the jet through the optically thick envelope are presented in figure [ fig : jet_env ] , where the density maps of the expanding jet at various times after @xmath38 in its hydrodynamical evolution are plotted .",
    "initially , the low - density jet is unable to move the envelope material at a speed comparable to its own and thus is abruptly decelerated . most of the energy output during that period is deposited into a cocoon surrounding the jet , in which the energy supplied by the jet exceeds that imparted to the swept - up envelope material by a factor @xmath123 . in the cocoon region",
    "the jet and ambient medium remain separated by a contact discontinuity where shearing instabilities are prominent .",
    "the cocoon region exhibits two important dynamical effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "first , it forms a weak shock that moves laterally at the relativistic internal sound speed , and second , it acts to partially collimate the jet itself .",
    "as the jet expands further into the envelope , the drastic density drop permits the jet head to accelerate to velocities close to the speed of light ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "thus , if it is a general property that the jet becomes relativistic near the boundary of the envelope , the outer edge of the envelope is reached in a crossing time @xmath125 ) as measured by an observer along the line of sight .",
    "after the jet has broken free from the envelope region , the fraction of relativistic plasma injected into the cocoon will be much reduced as the jet accelerates and @xmath126 . the amount of energy that accumulated in the cocoon while the jet was advancing sub - relativistically is @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the envelope traversal time and @xmath129 is the average speed of the jet head .",
    "the energy accumulated in this phase is thus larger than the binding energy of the envelope , above which the majority of main sequence stars are swallowed whole . ] . at the radius @xmath130 where the head of the jet starts to advance relativistically ,",
    "the volume of the region incorporated into the cocoon is related to both the jet and cocoon expansion velocities by @xmath131 . unlike the jet",
    ", this cocoon material does not have a relativistic outward motion , although it has a relativistic internal sound speed . at first an elongated bubble ( since pressure balance may never be reached within a radiation - dominated isentropic atmosphere ) will be inflated , which can expand most rapidly along the rotation axis and will eventually unbind the envelope ( figure [ fig : jet_coc ] ) . even under the extreme assumption that the envelope is fully formed at @xmath119 ,",
    "the energy deposited by the jet is expected to eject most of the envelope material in the optically thick region .",
    "thus , passage through this region can not significantly alter the jet launching conditions or enhance collimation .      instead of assuming the jet to be a steady outflow , here",
    "we suppose that it is irregular on timescales much shorter than @xmath38 .",
    "for instance , if the lorentz factor in the outflowing collimated ejecta varied by a factor of more than 2 , then the shocks that developed when fast material overtook slower material would be internally relativistic @xcite .",
    "dissipation would then take place whenever internal shocks developed in the ejecta , which can then be reconverted into energetic particles and radiation ( the jet may also lose energy as it propagates through the photon field of the accretion disk ) .",
    "internal shocks generated either as a consequence of fluctuations at the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or arising from the development of large - amplitude instabilities provide an attractive explanation for the large scale variability seen in the swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328a event @xcite .        to illustrate the basic idea , suppose that two blobs of equal mass , but with different lorentz factors @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( with @xmath134 ) are ejected at times @xmath135 and @xmath136 , where @xmath137 .",
    "in the case of highly relativistic ejecta , the shock develops after a distance of order @xmath138 the reconversion of bulk energy can be very efficient : when the two blobs share their momentum , they move with @xmath139 , so the fraction of the energy dissipated is @xmath140 high efficiency does not , therefore , require an impact on matter at rest ; all that is needed is that the relative motions in the comoving frame be relativistic .",
    "the evolution of a non - steady relativistic jet with randomly varying lorentz factor @xmath141 ( between 2 and 20 ) over a range of timescales @xmath142s is shown in figure  [ fig : svar ] .",
    "the average parameters of the jet are chosen so that they are similar to those displayed in figure  [ fig : jet_env ] .",
    "compared to figure  [ fig : jet_env ] , significant structural differences along the evacuated channel appear when faster material catches up with slower material and a strong shock forms .",
    "an internal shock in the relativistic jet will move with a lorentz factor of up to @xmath143 , and the emitting material behind the shock will be subject to a large doppler boost .",
    "dissipation , to be most effective , must occur when the envelope is optically thin , i.e. @xmath144 ( figure  [ fig : svar ] ) .",
    "the deceleration of the working surface allows slower ejecta to catch up with the head of the jet , replenishing and reenergizing the reverse shock and boosting the momentum in the working surface .",
    "since the efficiency of converting bulk motion to radiation in an internal shock depends on the difference between @xmath141 s , the fact that the working surface is decelerating ( @xmath145 ) implies that the efficiency will be much higher than in the standard case where @xmath141 is assumed to fluctuate by a factor of a few within the jet and among blobs on a typical timescale @xmath146 s.      we now turn our attention to the evolution of the jet as it expands through the large scale environment of the galactic nuclei where the density stratification is thought to be regulated by the interaction of winds from the surrounding massive stars .",

    "the jet , unable to move the surrounding material at a speed comparable to its own , is decelerated and , as a result , most of the energy output during that period is deposited into a cocoon surrounding the jet . as a first approximation , evolution of the cocoon s shape is governed both by the advance of the head and by the cocoon s own pressure - driven sideways expansion into the surrounding medium .",
    "heavy jets therefore propagate almost ballistically and are naturally surrounded by small cocoons .",
    "light jets have large cocoons and , as seen in figure [ fig : jet - large-1 ] , can be confined by the pressure of the shocked material .",
    "the cocoon will effectively collimate the jet @xcite as long as @xmath159 where @xmath160 gives the ratio between the jet s energy density and the rest - mass energy density of the surrounding medium at the location of the head .",
    "collimation is then seen to increase with decreasing @xmath161 for @xmath162 .",
    "when @xmath95 the jet s head velocity is constant and consequently most of the energy flowing into the cocoon can not effectively counterbalance the jet s expansion .",
    "the density profile @xmath163 in the stellar wind mass injection region ( region @xmath46 in figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) varies from @xmath164 with increasing @xmath77 for a @xmath165 and , as a result , the cocoon s pressure is expected to collimate the jet and decrease its opening angle .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : jet - large-2 ] in which the results of the simulations are directly compared with the evolution of the working surface as predicted by equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) . in a jetted source like swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328a ,",
    "the expansion of the working surface within the gas on scales @xmath166 pc is clearly incompatible with that predicted on the assumption of a constant jet opening angle .    .",
    "also shown ( red line ) is the cumulative energy injected by the relativistic jet as a function of time .",
    "after rarefaction wave reaches the jet head , which occurs at similar times in both cases , the available internal energy drops although it does so more abruptly in case _ b _ where the jet power is halted at @xmath167 . ]    if the jet were suddenly to turn off ( in case _ a _ this occurs at @xmath168 while in case _ b _ at @xmath151 ) it would be preceded by the collapse of the jet channel which , suddenly evacuated , would be filled in on the transverse sound crossing time by whatever material happened to surround it .",
    "this ambient or cocoon material could be driven into the jet channel at the internal sound speed ( figure  [ fig : jet - large-1 ] ) .",
    "after the evacuated channel collapses , a cylindrical rarefaction wave will propagate along the jet channel , reaching the head at @xmath169 when the jet has traveled a much larger distance ( @xmath170 ) than when it was initially turned off .",
    "this is followed by a series of compression and rarefaction waves of decreasing amplitude . in case",
    "_ a _ , the inclusion of the @xmath171 injection phase produces only a small change in @xmath172 .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figure  [ fig : jet - large-3 ] , where we have plotted the total internal energy available at the working surface .",
    "after the rarefaction wave reaches the jet head , which is observed to take place at comparable times in both of the cases depicted in figure  [ fig : jet - large-1 ] , the available internal energy drops although it does so less abruptly in case _ a _ where the jet continues to be powered until @xmath173 .",
    "the intensity of the radiation from the radio - emitting electrons which have recently emerged from the hot spot rapidly decreases after a time @xmath174 , which corresponds to a time @xmath175 as measured by an observer along the line of sight .",
    "when the jet becomes free at @xmath176 , the necessary condition for the jet to remain in pressure balance with its surroundings is no longer satisfied and strong shocks are driven into the jet . as a result , the contact discontinuity and the forward shock are abruptly decelerated .",
    "this deceleration allows ejecta to catch up and pass through a reverse shock just inside the contact discontinuity , increasing the dissipated internal energy at the shock front ( figure  [ fig : jet - large-4 ] ) and in principle giving rise to a longer - lived afterglow than that predicted by the communication delay between the working surface and the base of the jet .     for case",

    "quiescent black holes appear to be capable of producing directed flows of relativistic matter . given the twin requirements of super eddington luminosity and short flaring timescales , the currently favored models involve the disruption of a star with the subsequently accreted debris providing the required luminosity . here",
    "we examine , within this model , the consequences of assuming a relation between jet production and the state of their constituent accretion disks . in those sources that display jets , production of the jet",
    "should only occur when the disk is in a hard accretion state and not when the disk emission is soft . testing this prediction in quiescent galactic nuclei , as argued in section [ sec : demographics ] , will require statistical studies because the typical jet production duty cycle time is expected to be thousands of years .",
    "confirmation of this effect will provide additional evidence that accretion states similar to those in binary black holes also should exist in supermassive black holes . as we show in section",
    "[ sec : swift ] , many of the observed properties the swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328a event can be understood as resulting from a hot accretion flow , driven into a previously quiescent supermassive black hole , which is then subsequently collimated into a pair of anti - parallel jets .",
    "if we were to venture a general classification scheme for tidal disruption jets , we would obviously expect the black hole mass , the rate at which the gas is supplied to the black hole , the angular momentum of the black hole , the flow velocity and the orientation relative to our line of sight to be the essential parameters .",
    "most of the radiation we receive is reprocessed by matter quite distant from the black hole .",
    "the fact that jets are detectable at all means that some re - randomization of kinetic energy and re - acceleration of particles must be occurring along their length to counteract radiation and adiabatic losses . under the assumption that these prime movers are able to form collimated , relativistic outflows , the observable effects of the two major radiating regions , the working surface and internal shocks ,",
    "are studied .",
    "this leads to a unified picture where internal shocks ( and/or external compton at the base of the jet ) can provide most of the variable , high photon energy luminosity , and where the region of greatest radio emissivity is located at the head of the jet .",
    "hot radio spots are naturally interpreted as the working surface at the end of a jet .",
    "the jet is decelerated at a strong collisionless shock where particle acceleration and field amplification can occur .",
    "the relativistic electrons and magnetic field pressure are balanced by the ram pressure of the ambient medium . because the source moves relativistically , aberration of light",
    "must be accounted for when calculating the observed radio light curve as as well as the local direction of polarization . and",
    "as the radio hot spot is unlikely to be resolved , we can only measure the average polarization over the whole image . as a result",
    ", the breaking of symmetry of the emitting region around our line of sight is required in order to produce a net polarization .",
    "statistical studies over a sample of tidal disruption jets , or time resolved polarimetry of different emission episodes within a single event , may teach us about the dominant emission mechanism , the jet structure , or the magnetic field configuration within the hotspot .",
    "it is obvious from the discussions in this paper that the dynamics of tidal disruption jets are complex , especially because of rich interactions between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "confirmation was provided of the important notion that the visibility of jets , in particular the emission emanating from the head of the jet , is determined largely by the luminosity and velocity injection history of the transient jet as well as the properties of the surrounding medium .",
    "axisymmetric hydrodynamical calculations of these jets show that the resulting dynamics are different from those predicted by one - dimensional models ; interaction with the surrounding medium can not only enhance collimation but also mediate the communication delay between the base and the head of the jet . even in the simplest case of a jet",
    "whose thrust directly scales with @xmath177 , complex behavior with multiple possible transitions in the observable part of the radio afterglow lifetime may be seen .",
    "the eventual resulting afterglow light curve depends fairly strongly on the properties of @xmath177 , especially the impact parameter @xmath13 and mass of the star and the black hole .",
    "there is a good and bad side to this . on the negative side",
    ", it implies that one can not be too specific about the times at which we expect to see transitions in the observed emission . on the positive side , if and when we do see these transitions , they can be fairly constraining on the properties of the system .",
    "the x - ray and radio flux from the swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328 event has been interpreted as being emitted by the jet produced from the super - eddington accretion of material resulting from the disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole .",
    "for the first @xmath178 days since the flare triggered the bat instrument , the object exhibited tremendous variability on @xmath179 s timescales , with isotropic equivalent flare luminosities @xmath180 ergs / s in the soft x - rays alone . beyond this first month of violent activity ,",
    "the degree of variability decreased , and appeared to follow the predicted @xmath0 power law associated with the late - time evolution of the fallback @xcite .",
    "the initial month - long light curve plateau , punctuated by periods of extreme variability , has been presumed to be associated with the phase of the event in which the accretion rate exceeds the eddington limit @xcite . however , as the eddington limit is @xmath181 times smaller than the peak accretion rate for a complete disruption by a @xmath182 black hole , only a disruption by a more massive black hole or a partial disruption , for which the peak accretion rates are comparable to the eddington rate , are capable of producing such a short period of super - eddington accretion ( figures [ fig : dmdedens ] and [ fig : mdottime ] ) .",
    "but while a partial disruption or a disruption by a heavier black hole can yield a plateau of the appropriate duration , these events peak at a much later time relative to the time of disruption , resulting in a decay slope that yields a poor match to the observed x - ray light curve .     from 2 - 10 kev for swift j1644 + 57 .",
    "the black points show the measured flux from the event , whereas the blue points show the realization from our stochastic model of jet emission from @xmath183 realizations of a flare generated by the disruption of a @xmath18 star by a @xmath20 black hole that bears the most resemblance ( i.e. , the minimum @xmath184 ) to the observed light curve .",
    "the sample times for the chosen realization are selected to be equal to the observation times of the swift event .",
    "the gray contours show the 1- and 2-@xmath185 variances from the mean luminosity @xmath186 , which is shown as the solid black curve .",
    "the black dashed vertical line shows @xmath187 , the orbital period at the tidal radius , the characteristic timescale of variation in our model .",
    "the blue vertical lines show timescales associated with the presented realization , with the thin line showing @xmath38 , whereas the thick line shows @xmath172 as calculated by equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) . ]",
    "a proposed solution to this problem is to allow the star to penetrate more deeply at pericenter @xcite , for which analytical approximations in which the binding energy distribution across the star is presumed to be `` frozen in '' at pericenter @xcite can produce shorter flare times",
    ". these shorter flares could reproduce both the month - long plateau and the observed decay rate .",
    "however , numerical simulations by @xcite have shown that an increase of @xmath13 beyond the value for which the star is completely destroyed do not result in faster transients , with the time of peak actually tending to slightly _ larger _ values with increasing @xmath13 for complete disruptions .",
    "for very deep encounters in which general relativistic effects are important , @xcite show that while @xmath38 tends to smaller values , it does not scale as sharply as predicted by the energy freezing model , and the time at which a @xmath188 and a @xmath189 encounter cross the eddington limit is almost identical .",
    "therefore , a deep encounter is incapable of reproducing the duration of the two phases exhibited by the x - ray light curve .",
    "we suggest an alternative model in which the flare is a standard full disruption of a main sequence star , but that the triggering of the bat instrument and the month - long plateau are actually artifacts of variability driven at a timescale comparable to the orbital period at the tidal radius , @xmath190 . in this model , @xmath2 exceeds eddington even during the observed @xmath0 decay phase .",
    "variability on this timescale could be driven by the interaction of the material that returns to pericenter with previously accreted material within the accretion disk .",
    "hydrodynamical studies of the fallback stream have shown that the material that returns to pericenter after a disruption passes through a small nozzle region where it is compressed violently @xcite , resulting in a rapid heating of material that may affect the nozzle dynamics or the dynamics of the accretion disk . as both the production of the jet and the seed photons emitted by the disk are dependent on the instantaneous value of @xmath2 , the variability introduced by the fallback can have non - linear feedback effects which may be able to produce the observed variations in flux , as is often seen in three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of thick accretion disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )        to model this variability , we use the method of @xcite , in which the stochastic luminosity variation is modeled as a single ornstein - uhlenbeck process with characteristic frequency @xmath191 , which is then added to the mean luminosity @xmath192 . to match the basic character of the observed light curve",
    ", we adjust the amplitude of the driving noise depending on the degree to which @xmath186 exceeds the eddington ratio , with a minimum noise amplitude chosen to match the observed variability at late times . at late times",
    ", the driving noise we have selected is within a factor of a few of what is measured for steady - state agn .",
    "figure [ fig : swift ] shows the results of this simple model in comparison to the swift event for @xmath183 random realizations of a flare generated by the disruption of a @xmath18 star by a @xmath20 black hole , along with the realization that happens to give the best overall fit .",
    "the observed power , assumed to follow @xmath193 , is amplified by two powers of the doppler factor , @xmath194 , with @xmath195 and with 10% of the luminosity assumed to be emitted in the 2  10 kev energy range .",
    "for each realization , the triggering time is set when the isotropic equivalent luminosity of @xmath196 erg / s is surpassed . in general , this occurs close to the peak luminosity for the choice of parameters we have selected , with the trigger itself being caused by the apex of one of the mini - flares associated with our variable component .",
    "this leads to an envelope shape that shows a subtle decline from the initial triggering event within a few @xmath187 , and then flatten outs over tens of days until @xmath197 a few times @xmath38 .",
    "if the light curve near @xmath38 is characterized by a large degree of variability , as our models predicts , the triggering event occurs either before or after @xmath38 with almost equal probability , and thus identifying the actual time of peak within the light curve itself would be difficult , if not impossible .    as argued in section [ sec : jetwind ] , even for the simplest assumption of @xmath192 , we found that the resulting structure and dynamics of the radio hot spots are very different from those predicted by the standard spherical solutions @xcite .",
    "this is mainly because at early stages when @xmath198 the jet evolution is governed both by the advance of the head and by the cocoon s pressure - driven sideways expansion into the ambient medium .",
    "the rapid decrease in luminosity at @xmath38 would be preceded by the collapse of the jet channel .",
    "the collapse of both the channel and the cocoon would proceed from the galactic nuclei outward . a model in which the hot spots are simply turned off",
    "is incompatible with hydrodynamical collapse of the source .",
    "the fact that information about the rapid decrease in luminosity at @xmath199 is communicated to the jet head at @xmath153 ( figure [ fig : swift ] ) provides an attractive explanation ( without the need of late time energy ejection ) for the delay between the jet power x - ray luminosity and the radio afterglow ( thought to be produced by the synchrotron emitting electrons at the jet s head ) seen in the swift 1644 + 57/grb 110328a event @xcite .",
    "the most difficult task at present is to predict @xmath172 , the time at which the intensity of the radiation from the radio - emitting electrons which have recently emerged from the hot spot starts to rapidly decrease , which corresponds to a time @xmath175 as measured by an observer along the line of sight .",
    "this is mainly because the hydrodynamical collapse of the channel depends sensitively on the initial lorentz factor and opening angle of the jet as well as on the poorly known state of the surrounding environment , from the initial density gradient created by stellar wind injection to the large - scale ambient structures transversed by the jet s head at @xmath200 .",
    "the rate of transient events coming as the result of the tidal disruption of a main sequence star is highly dependent on the population of black holes and their immediate environments .",
    "the steady - state rate of stars entering the loss cone has been estimated by many authors @xcite , but these calculated rates ignore mass segregation , the mass function of stars within the sphere of influence @xcite , the importance of black hole mergers @xcite , and interactions between the central cluster and the host galaxy @xcite , all of which may affect the rate of stellar disruption . as implied by the number of agn flares thought to result from tidal disruptions @xcite , the average rate of disruption is known to be @xmath201 , but how these events are distributed among galaxies remains an open question .",
    "given these uncertainties , we assume that the rate of disruption is not dependent on either black hole or galaxy properties for the remainder of this section .",
    "jets are thought to form in optically thick accretion flows resulting from accretion rates that are in excess of eddington @xcite .",
    "the mass function of stars around black holes may be substantially different than the standard kroupa imf function @xcite , but the average stellar mass is on the order of @xmath18 for all black holes . as a result , the peak accretion rate simply scales with the orbital period at the tidal radius , which low - mass black holes can more easily produce jets from the disruption of a star given their smaller eddington limits .",
    "this biases the production of jets to low - mass black holes , of which our census is growing @xcite but is still too small to definitively relate to galactic velocity dispersion as has been demonstrated convincingly with black holes of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "emission resulting from disks , on the other hand , is thought to extend well below the eddington rate , and thus the only requirement to produce a transient disk from the disruption of a star is that the pericenter of the orbit does not lie within the black hole s schwarzschild radius . as a result , disks are not likely to be produced by disruptions for black holes of mass @xmath202 .",
    "figure [ fig : jet_disk ] shows the fraction of the total bolometric flux received by an observer from both the jet and disk components resulting from the tidal disruptions of a @xmath18 stars .",
    "the majority of stars that are fed into the black hole originate near the black hole s sphere of influence from the _ pinhole _ regime of disruption @xcite , and thus the differential contribution of stars as a function of the impact parameter @xmath13 approximately scales as @xmath203 .",
    "the left panel shows the expected contribution of events to each emission type assuming that black holes of all masses are equally common , an assumption which is not unreasonable given the potentially flat black hole mass function at low black hole mass as measured by @xcite .",
    "if the trend of @xmath204 continued to lower black hole masses , this plot would be further biased to black holes of lower mass given the large population of low - mass galaxies . if the trend does not continue and black holes of @xmath205 are rare , both emission components are biased to black holes of larger mass , as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : jet_disk ] .",
    "the limits on the mass of the black hole associated with the transient event swift j1644 + 57 coming from the variability timescale and the @xmath204 relation @xcite agree quite well with a black hole mass function that excludes low - mass black holes , but given the associated uncertainties in the mass determination even a completely flat distribution of black hole masses can not be completely ruled out .    an additional constraint on the progenitors of events similar to swift j1644 + 57 is the time at which @xmath2 reaches its peak value , @xmath38 , and the time at which @xmath2 drops below @xmath206 , @xmath173 . under the same assumptions used to generate figure [ fig : jet_disk ] , we show in figure [ fig : timehist ] the probability @xmath207 of observing a flare with a given value of @xmath38 and @xmath173 .",
    "we find that the most probable @xmath38 is a few to tens of days , whereas the most probable @xmath208  10 years , depending on whether or not low mass central black holes are common .",
    "both distributions are consistent with the swift event , which our model suggests was caught within days of the peak , and remained above the eddington limit for @xmath209 year .",
    "+ the discovery of flaring black hole candidates in nearby galaxies by swift will continue to elucidate the demography of the quasar and agn population , while also enabling us to distinguish between various theoretical models of tidal disruption . as the feeding rate evolves dramatically over only a period of weeks to months",
    ", the powering of these formerly dead quasars offers a unique perspective into how the production of jets from black holes depends on the rate at which they are fed and the state of the environment in which they reside .",
    "these events can provide valuable insight into the physical mechanisms that operate near massive black holes that are not continually active , a prospect that is otherwise only possible through the study of the nearest few massive black holes . as the number of events increases , the range of possible models that can simultaneously explain the luminosity , variability , color , and time - evolution of these events will diminish , enabling a firm characterization of one of the dominant feeding mechanisms of massive black holes in the local universe .",
