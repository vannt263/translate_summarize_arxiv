    "[ sec : substrate ] . here",
    "no fitting of the background permittivity is performed and we use @xmath112 as the permittivity of the substrate , suitable for si@xmath3n@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the same material parameters for the ag sphere are used in both calculations  @xcite .",
    "while the substrate - based calculation shows an overall lower resonance energy for all particle sizes , both approaches show a linear tendency with a nearly identical slope .",
    "compared to a free - space environment the presence of the dielectric substrate should induce a larger blueshift in the hydrodynamic model  @xcite , and indeed it does ( comparison not shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the fitted effective background permittivity in the calculations based on the nonlocal clausius - mossotti relation is larger than that of free space , and this makes that the two theoretical curves in fig .  [ fig : fig3](b ) become almost parallel .",
    "especially for the smallest particles @xmath113 $ ] the trend is striking similar , which indicates that ( i ) only the dipole mode of the sphere is important and ( ii ) the dipole mode is not significantly altered by the presence of the substrate .",
    "however , for larger particle diameters @xmath114 $ ] the substrate alters the dipole mode , which is visible in the slight convex curvature of the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) , in contrast to the concave curvature of the dashed line .",
    "surprisingly higher order multipoles in the sphere , which are anticipated to be enhanced due to the presence of the substrate  @xcite , show no significant contribution in the optical response .",
    "this is in fact due to the large interband absorption present in ag at the resonance energies of the higher order multipoles , which heavily dampens the contribution from these modes .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) we see that the experimentally observed blueshift exceeds the theoretical blueshift predicted by the nonlocal clausius  mossotti factor . in ref .",
    "@xcite we conjectured that the presence of the substrate could induce the experimentally observed larger blueshift , but from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3](b ) we see in more detail that the substrate - based calculations do not show a larger shift in energy than the nonlocal clausius  mossotti factor .",
    "we have studied the experimentally observed blueshift of the sp resonance energy of ag nanoparticles , when the particle diameters decrease from 26  nm to 3.5  nm . to interpret the measurements we considered two different systems within the theory of the nonlocal hydrodynamic model : a metal sphere embedded in a homogeneous environment and a metal sphere situated on a dielectric substrate of finite thickness .",
    "surprisingly , we find that both systems give rise to similar - sized blueshifts with decreasing particle size , despite the presence of the symmetry - breaking substrate .",
    "both theoretical calculations are in qualitative agreement with the measurements , but the theoretically calculated blueshift is smaller than the blueshift observed in the eels measurements .",
    "thus , we conclude that the inclusion of the substrate in the theoretical calculations can not quantitatively explain the measurements .",
    "this leads us to believe that the deviation between theory and experiment are to be sought for in the intrinsic properties of silver , such as the spill - out of electrons in combination with the screening from the _ d _ electrons  @xcite and size - dependent changes in the electronic band structure  @xcite , which are not taken into account in a hydrodynamic description .",
