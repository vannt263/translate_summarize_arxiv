    "requiring that these higgs penguin contributions do not saturate the experimental upper bound @xmath184 at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite , and neglecting mass difference between ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) , the condition |(_d)_32|^2+|(_d)_23|^2 < 0.2 ^ 2 ( m_a/500gev)^4 , [ eq - bsmumubound ] is imposed on the @xmath185 mixing yukawa couplings ( @xmath186 , @xmath86 ) at the renormalization scale @xmath187 . in the approximation of neglecting the qcd running between @xmath188 and @xmath189 , and also the @xmath17-enhanced correction to the @xmath190 coupling @xmath191 , eq .",
    "( [ eq - bsmumubound ] ) implies the bound @xmath192 for @xmath116 and @xmath193 gev , which is completely negligible compared to @xmath26 .",
    "we expect that this strong constraint still holds when more rigorous estimation of @xmath3 is adopted .",
    "we have studied the flavor - changing decay @xmath0 in the mssm , at large @xmath1 and with general flavor mixing of squarks .",
    "this case is interesting since the gluino and @xmath33 loops , which are negligible at moderate value of @xmath1 and with minimal flavor violation for squarks , are enhanced and might give contributions to this decay , comparable to the standard model and chargino loop contributions .",
    "this is due to the @xmath1-enhanced su(2)@xmath78u(1 ) gauge symmetry breaking and flavor mixing in the down - type squark sector , and loop - generated effective flavor - changing couplings of the charged higgs boson to quarks and squarks .",
    "however , the contributions to @xmath0 by new physics should be constrained by experimental data for other @xmath5 processes .    in this paper , we have focused our attention to the constraints from the radiative decay @xmath2 , since both of the @xmath0 and @xmath2 decays are enhanced by the su(2)@xmath78u(1 ) symmetry breaking and flavor mixing between the second and third generations of the quarks / squarks in the loops . as a very rough estimation of the constraints by @xmath2",
    ", we have calculated the correlations between new physics contributions to the wilson coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath94 for the @xmath0 and @xmath2 decays , respectively , for each new physics sector : gluino - squark , chargino - squark , and charged higgs - quark loops .",
    "calculation has been done at the leading order , but including @xmath1-enhanced corrections to the quark yukawa couplings in the loops .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the requirement that the new physics contributions @xmath95 for each sector are smaller than @xmath194 strongly constrains the new physics contributions @xmath29 .",
    "especially , the gluino contributions @xmath125 are suppressed much below @xmath26 due to their strong correlation with @xmath195 . in contrast , although the constraints by @xmath94 are also tight for chargino and charged higgs boson contributions , there still remains a possibility that their contributions to @xmath41 become sizable , @xmath196% , while keeping contributions to @xmath94 below @xmath194 .    as an example of the constraints by other @xmath5 processes , we have also considered the higgs penguin contributions to the decay @xmath3 , which might become much larger than the standard model contribution at large @xmath1 .",
    "it has been shown that the present experimental upper bound of the decay ratio may impose strong constraints on @xmath89 , suppressing it much below @xmath26 .    for more realistic analysis of @xmath0 in the mssm and estimation of the new physics contributions ,",
    "we need to scan over wider parameter space , including correlations between different contributions to @xmath41 , main parts of the qcd corrections and hadronic effects , and constraints from other flavor - changing processes using more precise formulas of the new physics contributions .",
    "we leave such studies for future works .",
