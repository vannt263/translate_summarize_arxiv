    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmdcs ) are quasi - two - dimensional , highly anisotropic layered compounds that are of great interest in basic research as well as in applications in such areas as lubrication , catalysis , electrochemical photocells , and novel battery systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , it became possible to synthesize other forms of tmdcs such as balls and nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "tmdcs generally have the formula mx@xmath1 , where m is a transition metal , such as vanadium , titanium , tantalum , molybdenum , or others , and x is a chalcogen atom , such as sulfur , selenium , or tellurium .",
    "each layer consists of a metal sheet sandwitched between two chalcogen sheets . whereas within each layer",
    "the bonds connecting a metal atom in one sheet to the chalcogen atoms in surrounding sheets are strong covalent bonds , adjacent layers are only weakly coupled through the van der waal s interaction .",
    "two types of mx@xmath1 sandwitches occur depending on the coordination of the transition metal atom by the chalcogens . in 1t - mx@xmath1",
    "the coordination is octahedral whereas in 2h - mx@xmath1 it is trigonal prismatic .",
    "the weak coupling between adjacent layers in tmdcs makes it possible to introduce foreign species into the region between these layers , a region called the van der waal s gap .",
    "this process , known as intercalation , provides the ability to tune the electronic properties of the system by controlling the type and concentration of the intercalant .",
    "this is a general property of layered materials , and just like graphite , which has been intercalated with many kinds of atoms and molecules ,  @xcite tmdcs have been intercalated with alkali atoms , transition metal atoms , and organic and inorganic molecules  @xcite .    among the most important properties of tmdcs",
    "is that some of them undergo a phase transition to a charge density wave ( cdw ) state as the temperature is lowered  @xcite .",
    "1t - tise@xmath1 is one of the first compounds where the cdw state was observed at a temperature of 200k  @xcite .",
    "the state is associated with the formation of a commensurate ( 2x2x2 ) superlattice .",
    "it is not completely clear what mechanism drives this phase transition .",
    "possible explanations are offered in terms of an indirect jahn - teller effect ,  @xcite or by an exciton condensation mechanism  @xcite .",
    "recent angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies have not resolved whether 1t - tise@xmath1 is a semimetal with low electron and hole concentraion or a narrow - gap semiconductor in either the normal or the cdw state  @xcite .",
    "optical measurements , on the other hand , reveal that tise@xmath1 is a semimetal with low carrier density at temperatures above as well as below the cdw transition  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with band structure calculations  @xcite which reveal the presence of an electron pocket , around the l point in the brillouin zone , derived from ti 3d states , and a hole pocket around the @xmath3 point derived from se 4p states .",
    "recently it was reported  @xcite that upon controlled intercalation of tise@xmath1 with cu to yield cu@xmath0tise@xmath1 the cdw transition is continually suppressed , making way for a new superconducting state that emerges near @xmath4 , with a maximum transition temperature t@xmath5 of 4.15k ocurring at @xmath6 ; further increase in @xmath2 results in a drop of t@xmath5 .",
    "it should be noted that while superconductivity was previously observed in 2h structures , such as 2h - nbse@xmath1 , 2h - tase@xmath1 , 2h - nbs@xmath1 , and 2h - tas@xmath1 ,  @xcite the copper intercalated tise@xmath1 is the first superconducting 1t - structured tmdc .",
    "as cu atoms are intercalated , they move into the van der waal s gap separating adjacent tise@xmath1 layers . with a single electron in the outer 4s shell ,",
    "electronic charge transfer proceeds from cu to the tise@xmath1 layers , causing an increase in the number of electrons in the ti 3d bands and a reduction in the number of holes in the se 4p bands . as a result of this ,",
    "the effective screening of the electron - hole coulumb interaction is enhanced , causing a drop in the cdw transition temperature as the intercalant concentration increases , and at @xmath7 the transition is completelly supressed .",
    "the superconducting transition , on the other hand , emerges at @xmath4 .",
    "the cu@xmath0tise@xmath1 phase diagram resembles the corresponding diagram in cuprate and heavy fermion superconductors , except that there it is the antiferromagnetic spin order that competes with superconductivity , whereas in cu@xmath0tise@xmath1 it is the charge order  @xcite .",
    "recently , calculations of density of states ( dos ) and the electron phonon coupling , using linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) method within the local density approximation , were reported for the case @xmath6 by jeong and jarlborg  @xcite .",
    "the authors consider a 2x2x3 supercell , cu(tise@xmath1)@xmath8 , and conclude that charge transfer from copper raises the electronic density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "they also find a strong dependence on pressure of the dos , and consequently the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "in this paper we report band structure calculations for cu@xmath0tise@xmath1 for values of @xmath2 ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 in an attempt to study the effect of copper intercalation on the electronic structure of tise@xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we calculate the energy bands of tise@xmath1 and the compounds cu@xmath11tise@xmath1 , cu@xmath12tise@xmath1 , and cu@xmath13tise@xmath1 . in section  [",
    "sec : method ] we discuss the computational method and some relevant details , and in section  [ sec : results_and_discussion ] we discuss the results and conclusions .",
    "the first - principles calculations presented in this work were performed using the all - electron full potential linear augmented plane wave plus local orbitals ( fp - lapw+lo ) method as implemented in wen2k code  @xcite . in this method",
    "the core states are treated in a fully relativistic way but the valence states are treated at a scalar relativistic level .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential was calculated using the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) as proposed by pedrew , burke , and ernzerhof  @xcite .    in the calculations on 1t - tise@xmath1",
    "the experimentally measured lattice constants ( @xmath14 = @xmath15 = 3.534 , @xmath16 ) are employed  @xcite .",
    "the distance betwen the ti plane and either of the adjacent se planes is @xmath17 , where the value of @xmath18 is obtained by minimizing the forces on the atoms to below 2.0 mry / bohr . in calculations on the intercalated compounds",
    "cu@xmath0tise@xmath1 the lattice constants are taken to coincide with the experimental values  @xcite , but the internal structure of the unit cell is allowed to relax , subject only to the constraint that the space group remains unchanged ; again the force on each atom is reduced to below 2.0 mry / bohr . for the compound cu@xmath11tise@xmath1",
    "the structure is taken to be that of tise@xmath1 4x4 superlattice in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane , with one cu atom placed midway between one ti atom in one layer and the nearest ti atom in the adjacent layer ; the unit cell is then hexagonal with @xmath19 .",
    "accordingly , the unit cell has 1 cu atom , 16 ti atoms , and 32 se atoms , and if one ti atom is placed at the origin ( 0,0,0 ) , then the cu atom is placed at ( 0,0,@xmath20/2 ) , where @xmath20 is the lattice parameter , in the direction normal to the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane , in the intercalated systems .",
    "a similar situation holds for cu@xmath13tise@xmath1 and cu@xmath12tise@xmath1 where the corresponding superlattices in the @xmath14-@xmath15 plane are 3x3 and @xmath21x@xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the space group is p-3m1(#164 ) , the same as in tise@xmath1 , in all these structures , except in cu@xmath12tise@xmath1 , where it is p-3(#147 ) .",
    "it should be noted here that the superlattice structure employed in these calculations is not necessarily the experimental lattice structure .",
    "for example , for the case @xmath22 , we assume that the system is periodic with lattice constants in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 directions that are 4 times bigger than the corresponding values for @xmath23 , whereas the experimental crystal structure is not reported and there may well be some disorder in the system such that the cu atoms , residing between adjacent tmdc layers , do not form a perfectly periodic two - dimensional lattice .    for calculations in this work , the radii of the muffin - tin spheres for cu , ti , and se atoms were taken to be 2.5a@xmath24 , 2.5a@xmath24 , and 2.25a@xmath24 respectively , where a@xmath24 is the bohr radius .",
    "the number of k - points in the irreducible part of the brillouin zone ( bz ) were 38 , 41 , 47 , and 360 for cu@xmath11tise@xmath1 , cu@xmath12tise@xmath1 , cu@xmath13tise@xmath1 , and tise@xmath1 , respectively ; these numbers were chosen so that the density of k - points in the whole bz is roughly the same in the four cases .",
    "for all structures considered in this work we set the parameter r@xmath25k@xmath26=7 , where r@xmath25 is the smallest muffin - tin radius and k@xmath26 is a cutoff wave - vector .",
    "the valence wavefunctions inside the muffin - tin spheres are expanded in terms of spherical harmonics up to @xmath27 = 10 while in the interstitial region they are expanded in plane waves with a wave - vector cutoff k@xmath26 , and the charge density is fourier expanded up to g@xmath26=14a@xmath28 .",
    "convergence of the self consistent field calculations is attained with a total energy convergence tolerance of 0.1 mry .",
    "( color online)the unit cell of tise@xmath1 is shown in ( a ) , while the brillouin zone , and the k - path along which the energy bands are calculated , are shown in ( b ) . in ( c ) , the unit cell for cu(tise@xmath1)@xmath29 is shown.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    .[table : crystal_structure_cu]comparison of the crystal structure of cu(tise@xmath1)@xmath29 before optimization , as derived from the stucture of tise@xmath1 , with the relaxed structure obtained by minimizing the forces on the atoms .",

    "in conclusion , we have presented calculations , within the density functional theory , of the electronic energy bands and the density of state of copper intercalated tise@xmath1 . we have shown that a rigid band model describes reasonably well the effect of the intercalation on ti 3d derived bands , but not as well for se 4p derived bands . as a consequence of charge transfer from the cu atoms to the host layers , the fermi level rises ,",
    "the se 4p hole pocket gets filled ; this is the probable cause for the suppression of the charge density wave transition .",
    "this , coupled with an increase of the electronic density of states at the fermi level , is perhaps the cause of the emerging superconductivity in these novel intercalation compounds ."
