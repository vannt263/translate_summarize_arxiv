    "@xmath12 is a suitable real sequence .",
    "well known examples of refinable ripplets are the cardinal b - splines , i.e. the polynomial b - splines on integer nodes . starting from the seminal paper of goodman and micchelli ,",
    "many families of two - scale refinable ripplets were constructed ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , @xmath13-scale refinable ripplets , with dilation @xmath13 greater than 2 , were addressed in @xcite and refinable ripplets with dilation 3 were constructed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in refinable ripplets lies in the fact that they give rise to convergent subdivision algorithms for the reconstruction of curves and the limit curves they generate preserve the shape of the initial data @xcite .",
    "refinable ripplets can also be proved to solve the cardinal interpolation problem @xcite .",
    "for instance , the construction of cardinal interpolants by by means of the refinable ripplets in @xcite was addressed in @xcite .",
    "refinable ripplets have good properties not only in the context of geometric modeling and function approximation but they also enjoy some optimality properties useful in signal processing .",
    "in fact , refinable ripplets induces a multiresolution analysis in @xmath14 that allows us to generate a nested sequence of wavelet spaces .",
    "actually , it is always possible to construct compactly supported semiorthogonal wavelet bases starting from a refinable ripplet @xcite .",
    "moreover , refinable ripplets have asymptotically , i.e. when their smoothness tends to infinity , the same optimal time - frequency window achieved by the gaussian function @xcite . since the rate of convergence",
    "can be proved to be very fast for a large class of ripplets , including , for instance , the refinable ripplets introduced in @xcite , refinable ripplets can approximate the gaussian with high accuracy giving rise to efficient algorithms for signal analysis @xcite .",
    "finally , a ripplet can be seen as a discrete kernel satisfying a causality property so making the refinable ripplets particularly attractive in the scale - time analysis of signals @xcite .",

    "is referred to as a _ stationary two - scale equation_. from the point of view of signal processing this means that the same analysis and synthesis filters are used at all dyadic scales @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the use of the same set of filters at each scale does not give great flexibility in applications , especially when some preprocessing steps with different filters are required .",

    "the use of different scaling masks at different scales allows us to construct refinable functions endowed with properties that can not be achieved in the stationary setting .",
    "for instance , the nonstationary process generated by the b - spline masks of increasing support gives rise to a refinable function that is compactly supported while belongs to @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "other families of @xmath19 nonstationary refinable functions based on pseudo - spline masks were constructed in @xcite .",
    "exponential splines too can be associated to a nonstationary process @xcite .",
    "they reproduce exponential polynomials and the associated wavelet bases can be successfully used in the analysis of signals with exponential behavior @xcite .",
    "families of nonstationary refinable ripplets were introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter are highly localized in the scale - time plane , a property that is crucial in many applications .",
    "for this reason , in the present paper we focus our interest in this family of nonstationary refinable ripplets and prove that these ripplets enjoy several properties which are relevant in the context of both geometric modeling and signal processing .",
    "then , we construct the associated wavelet bases .",
    "we notice that , since the refinable ripplets we are considering are non orthogonal , compactly supported orthogonal wavelets belonging to the space generated by their translates do not exists .",
    "this motivates us to construct nonstationary _",

    "since we are interested in implementing efficient nonstationary decomposition and reconstruction algorithms for signal processing , we construct also the corresponding pairs of nonstationary filters to be used in the analysis and synthesis of a given discrete signal .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "2 we give some basic definition concerning nonstationary multiresolution analysis and wavelet spaces and recall some results about the existence of solutions of the nonstationary refinable equations ( [ nseq_int ] ) .",
    "the class of nonstationary refinable functions we are interested in is described in section  3 , while in section  4 we proved some approximation properties that were not addressed in @xcite . in section  5",
    "we construct the nonstationary prewavelet bases associated with the nonstationary refinable ripplets in the class and give an efficient algorithm to evaluate nonstationary prewavelet masks .",
    "the construction of compactly supported biorthogonal bases and filters , which give rise to efficient decomposition and reconstruction formulas for discrete signals , is addressed in section  6 . finally , in section  7 some examples of nonstationary masks and refinable bases are given and the corresponding nonstationary filters are constructed .",
    "a simple test on the analysis of a spike - like signal is also shown .",
    "wavelet spaces are usually constructed starting from a multiresolution analysis that is a sequence @xmath20 of nested subspaces which are dense in @xmath14 and enjoy the separation property .",
