    "low - dimensional or frustrated quantum magnets were revealed to exhibit exotic ground states , magnetic excitations , and quantum phase transitions ( qpts).@xcite for a particular case of the spin - gapped antiferromagnets , the external magnetic field can close the gap in the spectrum , which results in a qpt between a low - field disordered paramagnetic phase and a high - field long - range ordered one .",
    "an intriguing finding is that this ordered phase can be approximately described as a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons.@xcite many experimental investigations on the critical properties of the bec - related qpt have been carried out , including the characterizations of the magnon spectrum , the magnetization , the specific heat and the thermal transport , etc.@xcite in a recent study , the heat transport properties of a magnon bec material , nicl@xmath1-@xmath6sc(nh@xmath1)@xmath1 ( dtn ) , were found to display strong anomalies at the qpts and the heat conductivity of the bec state seemed to be much enhanced upon lowering temperatures ( approaching the absolute zero).@xcite this result shows an analogy between the magnon bec and the superfluid of @xmath7he in the aspect of the ability of transporting heat . however , one notable facet is that magnons act as heat carriers only in the direction of the spin chains of this compound , whereas they only scatter phonons in the transverse direction.@xcite so the exchange anisotropy may play the key role in the heat transport of magnetic excitations .",
    "a later experimental work confirmed the main features of transport properties of dtn , but an alternative picture based on the mass renormalization and impurity scattering effects was proposed to explain the thermal transport data.@xcite in any case , the qpts associated with the magnon bec are believed to significantly affect the heat transport properties and the low - energy magnetic excitations provide a substantial contribution to the heat transport . to get the general principals of the heat transport in the magnon bec state , we need to carry out systematic studies on more members of the magnon bec materials .",
    "ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 ( bmo ) is an @xmath8 = 1 quantum spin - dimer system exhibiting the bec of spin degrees of freedom .",
    "it crystallizes in the rhombohedral @xmath9 structure with the pairs of mn@xmath10 3@xmath11 ions ( @xmath8 = 1 ) arranged vertically on the hexagonal layers.@xcite the spins of mn@xmath10 ions of each pair are coupled antiferromagnetically to form spin dimers.@xcite neutron scattering results indicated an intradimer exchange energy @xmath12 = 1.642 mev , an interdimer coupling between mn ions in the same plane @xmath13 = 0.1136 mev , an interdimer coupling between mn ions in the adjacent planes @xmath14 mev , and the next nearest neighbor interdimer interactions between bilayers ( along the @xmath5 axis ) @xmath15 mev.@xcite the strong in - plane spin - dimer interaction results in a spin - singlet ground state , with a spin gap of 1.05 mev to the lowest triplet state and a second larger gap to the quintuplet state .",
    "bmo displays a peculiar phase diagram in magnetic field when the zeeman effect lowers the @xmath16 = 1 triplet states and the @xmath16 = 2 quintuplet states.@xcite corresponding to the closures of two spin gaps with increasing magnetic field , there are two sequential magnetically ordered states and four quantum critical fields : @xmath17 = 8.7 t , @xmath18 = 26.5 t , @xmath19 = 32.5 t , @xmath20 = 47.9 t for @xmath21.@xcite the peculiarity is that the first ordered phase for @xmath22 and the second one for @xmath23 are described as the triplet condensation and the quintuplet condensation , respectively.@xcite furthermore , bmo was found to have a weak single - ion uniaxial anisotropy , characterized by @xmath24 = 0.032 mev.@xcite the phase diagram for @xmath25 is a bit more complicated , with two phases of the triplet condensation.@xcite it was revealed that both the single - ion anisotropy and the geometry frustration play crucial roles in determining the phase diagram.@xcite    in this work , we study the thermal conductivity ( @xmath3 ) of bmo single crystal to probe the field - induced qpts and the role of magnetic excitations in the heat transport .",
    "it is found that both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are strongly suppressed in magnetic fields , particularly at the field - induced qpts , which demonstrates that at very low temperatures the magnons mainly act as phonon scatterers even in the long - range ordered state .",
    "the present results indicate that magnon - bec state may not necessarily exhibit large thermal conductivity and the ability of magnetic excitations transporting heat is determined by the magnetic structure and the anisotropic spin exchange .",
    "high - quality single crystals of ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 are grown by a slowly cooling method using naoh as a solvent.@xcite the crystals have a hexagonal - platelet - like shape with large sizes up to 5 @xmath28 5 @xmath28 2.5 mm@xmath29 .",
    "the largest surface is the @xmath4 plane and the thickness is along the @xmath5 axis , determined by using the x - ray diffraction and the laue photograph .",
    "the specific heat is measured by the relaxation method in the temperature range from 0.4 to 20 k using a commercial physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) .",
    "both the @xmath4-plane and the @xmath5-axis thermal conductivities ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) are measured using the conventional steady - state technique . particularly , the data at low temperature and in high magnetic field are taken by using a ",

    "inset : the data in a broader temperature range from 0.4 to 20 k.,width=245 ]    it is known that , in a magnetic insulator , heat can be carried by phonons and magnetic excitations , and the interaction between them usually induces scattering on heat carriers , which is a negative effect on the heat transport . to analysis the heat transport properties quantitatively ,",
    "it is necessary to know the phononic specific heat from the experiments .",
    "figure 1 shows the low-@xmath30 specific heat of the ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystal . at @xmath31 6 k",
    ", there appears a broad shoulder - like feature , which is apparently of magnetic origin .",
    "below 5 k , the specific heat decreases quickly with temperature and it does not show a @xmath32 dependence of the phonon specific heat . the same result has been reported in an earlier work.@xcite the low-@xmath30 specific heat was found to be able to described by a formula for the gapped magnetic excitations,@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number of excited states per spin dimer , @xmath35 is the gas constant , and @xmath36 is the energy gap of magnetic excitations .",

    "( [ sh ] ) can not achieve perfect fitting to the data , particulary for the subkelvin data .     and @xmath27 of ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals in zero and @xmath38 t fields .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the approximate @xmath39 and @xmath40 dependencies of the thermal conductivity at very low temperatures and at high temperatures , respectively.,width=321 ]    figure 2 shows the temperature dependencies of @xmath26 and @xmath27 of bmo single crystals in zero and 14 t fields , which are applied along either the @xmath4 plane or the @xmath5 axis .",
    "apparently , the zero - field thermal conductivities show rather weak anisotropy at high temperatures .",
    "each @xmath41 curve exhibits a phonon peak at 18 k with the peak values nearly the same for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath40 dependence of @xmath41 at high temperatures is the characteristic of phonon heat transport dominated by the phonon - phonon umklapp scattering.@xcite at sub - kelvin temperatures , both @xmath42 and @xmath43 show an approximate @xmath39 dependence , which indicates that the boundary scattering limit of phonon thermal conductivity is approached or that the microscopic scattering on phonons is negligible.@xcite besides these usual behaviors belonging to the phonon heat transport , there is a  shoulderlike \" feature in the zero - field @xmath41 at 6.5 k , which is likely due to some kind of resonant scattering on phonons.@xcite applying 14 t magnetic field leads to a strong suppression of low-@xmath30 thermal conductivity and the disappearance of the  shoulderlike \" feature .",
    "therefore , the phonon resonant scattering in zero field must be of magnetic origin .",
    "similar result has been found in another spin - gapped material , dtn.@xcite on the other hand , there is no evidence for the magnon heat transport in bmo , which is reasonable at very low temperatures considering the negligible magnon excitations due to the finite spin gap . in high magnetic field ,",
    "the strong suppression of phonon heat transport in a broad temperature range is apparently due to the enhancement of magnetic scattering , which can also be seen from the following magnetic - field dependencies of @xmath3 .",
    "another peculiar feature of 14 t @xmath41 data is the small jumps of conductivity at low temperatures , which are related to the field - induced antiferromagnetic ( af ) transitions .",
    "note that even with these increases of @xmath3 at the phase transitions , the lower-@xmath30 thermal conductivities are still much smaller than the zero - field values , indicating that the phonons are still strongly scattered by magnetic excitations in the field - induced af state .",
    "mn@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals at low temperatures.,width=321 ]    figure 3 shows the detailed magnetic field dependencies of @xmath44 and @xmath26 for both @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear that they are nearly isotropic on the field direction .",
    "the overall behavior of @xmath47 is that the magnetic field strongly suppresses thermal conductivity , but at very low temperatures , _",
    "i.e. _ , at 0.36 and 0.5 k , @xmath3 shows upturn above some critical fields . since the zero - field thermal conductivity of bmo is purely phononic , the field - induced suppression of @xmath3 is clearly a result of scattering effect on phonons by some magnetic excitations . in this regard ,",
    "the phonon scattering by paramagnetic moments , which are commonly existing as impurities or spin vacancies , is one of the unavoidable effects.@xcite however , the field dependencies of @xmath3 shown in fig .",
    "3 are rather different from the standard one of paramagnetic moments scattering.@xcite the main origin for the @xmath47 behaviors is therefore the phonon scattering by magnon excitations .",
    "the low - field quantum disordered phase has a finite spin gap , which can be weakened by the zeeman effect . at a fixed temperature , with increasing the magnetic field ,",
    "the spin gap decreases and the number of low - energy magnons increases quickly , which can strongly scatter phonons and leads to a significant suppression of @xmath3 .    a notable feature of @xmath47 isotherms is the upturn of @xmath3 in high magnetic field and at very low temperatures .",
    "this increase of @xmath3 is obviously related to the field - induced af order since the transition fields are found to be coincided with the phase boundary of high - field ordered phase , _",
    "i.e. _ , the magnon bec state .",
    "there are two possible reasons for the increase of @xmath3 in the bec state .",
    "first , the phonon scattering by magnons is weakened when the magnon bec occurs .",
    "second , the magnons in the bec state have a positive effect on @xmath3 by transporting the heat directly .",
    "if the magnons transport the energy , due to the anisotropy of the exchange and the low - dimensionality of the spin structure , the field dependence of @xmath3 should exhibit obvious anisotropy on the direction of heat current with the same field.@xcite however , it can be seen from fig .",
    "3 that the upturn behaviors actually show a weak anisotropy on the direction of magnetic field rather than on that of the heat current .",
    "this means that the upturn of thermal conductivity in the bec state is a result of the weakening of magnon - phonon scattering . in other words , although the magnon scattering on phonons are generally strong at high fields , it is more significant at the critical fields because of the strong spin fluctuations .",
    "although the above discussions are quite clear in catching the main physics of the observed heat transport properties , it is useful to try a more quantitative analysis on the experimental data . first , since the phonons are the only one type of heat carriers , the zero - field @xmath41 data are likely to be fitted by a classical debye model of phonon thermal conductivity@xcite @xmath48 in which @xmath49 is the phonon frequency , @xmath50 is dimensionless , and @xmath51 is the phonon relaxation rate . the relaxation time is determined by @xmath52 which represent the phonon scattering by the grain boundary , the point defects , the phonon - phonon umklapp scattering , and the resonant scattering , respectively.@xcite the average sound velocity @xmath53 can be calculated from the debye temperature using the formula @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the number density of atoms . for bmo",
    ", however , the debye temperature can not be simply obtained from the phonon specific - heat data , as the data in fig . 1 indicate . for an estimation ,",
    "we refer the specific - heat data of ba@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2,@xcite a nonmagnetic material having the same crystal structure as bmo .",
    "the phonon specific - heat coefficient @xmath56 j / k@xmath7mol can be easily obtained from a @xmath32-fitting to the low-@xmath30 data.@xcite with this @xmath57 value , the debye temperature and the sound velocity of bmo are calculated to be 346 k and 2900 m / s , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath58 describing the boundary scattering is the the averaged sample width of the samples .",
    "the other parameters @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 are free ones .",
    "one difficulty of getting a precise calculation using eq . ( [ kappa ] ) is the description of @xmath62 . in bmo",
    ", the magnetic excitations can strongly scatter phonons . considering the energy dispersion of magnons ,",
    "it is very difficult to get a transparent formula for @xmath62 .",
    "* for a simple analysis , one can neglect the magnon dispersion and assume that the resonant scattering of phonons occurs via a singlet - triplet excitations of dimerized states .",
    "thus , the resonant scattering rate can be expressed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a free parameter while @xmath65 describes the difference of thermal populations of the excited triplet and the ground singlet states ( the contribution of a higher - level excitations of quintuplet states is negligibly small ) .",
    "it is known that@xcite @xmath66 with @xmath67 the energy gap of magnetic spectrum , which is about 14.2 k from the specific - heat data .",
    "data ( a ) and the @xmath68 data ( b ) with the calculation results using the debye model.,width=226 ]    the zero - field thermal conductivity data are able to be fitted by using the above formula very well . as an example",
    ", the zero - field data from fig . 2(a ) and the fitting curve are displayed in fig .",
    "the best fitting parameters are @xmath59 = 1.3 @xmath28 10@xmath69 s@xmath29 , @xmath60 = 3.0 @xmath28 10@xmath70 k@xmath71s@xmath72 , @xmath61 = 6.0 , and @xmath64 = 1.6 @xmath28 10@xmath73 s@xmath71 .",
    "second , the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath3 can also be calculated using the debye model .",
    "the effect of magnetic field is to induce the zeeman splitting of the degenerate triplet states and a linear decrease of the energy gap with field , that is , @xmath74 the land factor was known to be @xmath75.@xcite a typical comparison between the @xmath47 data and the calculations is shown in fig .",
    "although there is a qualitative agreement between the experimental data and the calculation , the quantitative difference is quite large . in particular , at low fields the experimental data show much stronger suppression than the calculated result .",
    "it is expectable from the classical boltzmann distribution that the magnon excitations are negligibly weak at subkelvin temperatures when the spin gap is larger than 10 k. the experimental data suggest that the magnon excitations , which may be because of the quantum fluctuations , are much stronger than the thermal excitation produces .",
    "another reason for the significant discrepancy is likely related to the simple assumption of the resonant phonon scattering by the two - level magnetic excitations . actually , the magnon dispersions of bmo are not very weak , which makes the scattering between phonons and magnetic excitations inelastic and much more complicated . a precise calculation based on the magnon - phonon scattering calls for the details of both the phonon spectra and the magnon dispersions.@xcite",
    "it is useful to compare these results with those of dtn , in which the magnetic field along the @xmath5 axis ( the spin - chain direction ) can close the spin gap and drive the af phase transition . in dtn , the heat transport along the @xmath5 axis or perpendicular to it present remarkably anisotropic behaviors with increasing field , that is , @xmath27 show sharp peaks at @xmath17 while @xmath26 show dips at the same position.@xcite those demonstrated that magnons act as the heat carriers along the @xmath5 axis and the phonon scatterers along the @xmath4 plane , respectively.@xcite furthermore , the @xmath27 of dtn in the af state ( for @xmath76 ) keep increasing with lowering the temperature , also pointing to a potentially large heat transport in the magnon bec phase.@xcite the present @xmath47 behaviors of bmo for both @xmath26 and @xmath27 are very similar to those of @xmath68 in dtn , which suggests that the magnetic scattering on phonons are enhanced upon approaching the critical fields .",
    "in contrast to the case of dtn , the magnetic excitations of bmo do not contribute to transporting heat substantially along either the @xmath4 plane or the @xmath5 axis .",
    "therefore , whether the magnon bec state of the spin - gapped compounds can have strong ability of transporting heat is mainly dependent on such factors as the nature of the magnetic structure and the exchange anisotropy etc .",
    "the field - induced af state or magnon bec is not the sufficient condition for observable magnon transport .    .",
    "the arrows indicate the critical temperatures where @xmath3 starts to increase.,width=321 ]    the above are , however , not the whole story because there is only one transition in each @xmath47 isotherm for both @xmath77 and @xmath45 , whereas the former experiments revealed a single magnetic transition and two distinct transitions , respectively . for more precise description ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5 a series of @xmath41 curves for magnetic fields varying between 10 and 14 t. it is found that below 10 t , there is no any anomaly in the @xmath41 curves down to 0.3 k. above 10 t , a jump in @xmath41 shows up and becomes bigger with increasing field up to 14 t. from these data , we can obtain the transition points on the @xmath78 phase diagram and compare them with the boundaries of the magnetically ordered phases determined by heat capacity , magnetocaloric effect , and cantilever torque measurements,@xcite as shown in fig . 6",
    "it is interesting that the jump - like anomalies of @xmath3 occur at the boundary of phase i , that is , the thermal conductivity increases at the phase transitions to phase i from either the low - field disordered state or the antiferromagnetically ordered phase ii .",
    "this phenomenon has a good correspondence to the specific - heat data,@xcite which shows a sharp lambdalike peak and a much weaker and less divergent peak at the phase transitions from the disordered state or phase ii to phase i and the disordered state to phase ii , respectively .",
    "it is likely that the phase transition associated with lambdalike specific - heat anomaly has more significant critical fluctuations that strongly scatter phonons .",
    "curves from fig .",
    "temperature - field phase diagram , obtained by heat capacity and magnetocaloric effect measurements from ref .",
    ", is shown for comparison .",
    "i and ii indicate two different phases of the triplet condensate.@xcite , width=264 ]",
    "we study the heat transport of ba@xmath0mn@xmath1o@xmath2 single crystals at very low temperatures and in high magnetic fields to probe the field - induced magnetic phase transitions and the role of magnons in the transport properties . in zero field ,",
    "the low-@xmath30 thermal conductivity shows a purely phononic transport behavior . in applied strong field ,",
    "the spin gap is gradually diminished and the magnetic excitations are populated , which induces an enhanced magnetic scattering on phonons and an overall strong suppression of thermal conductivity with increasing field . moreover , at very low temperatures where the closure of spin gap results in a long - range ordered af state , the phonons are more significantly scattered at the phase transitions .",
