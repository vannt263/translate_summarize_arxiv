    "the main consequence of inflation is the generation of primordial cosmological perturbations @xcite and the production of long wavelength gravitational waves ( tensor perturbations )  @xcite .",
    "the predicted slightly red - tilted spectrum of the scalar perturbations is at present in excellent agreement with the measurements of the cmb fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the detection of a small deviation of the spectrum from flat together with the observation of primordial gravitational waves would make us completely confident in early - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the detection of primordial gravitational waves is not easy , but they can be seen indirectly in the b - mode of the cmb polarization ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in standard slow - roll inflationary scenarios",
    "@xcite the amplitude of the tensor perturbations can , in principle , be large enough to be discovered .",
    "however , it is only on the border of detectability in future experiments .",
    "there is no problem to modify the inflationary scenarios in a way to suppress the tensor component produced during inflation . in particular , in models such as new inflation  @xcite and hybrid inflation  @xcite , tensor perturbations are typically small  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the curvaton scenario @xcite and k - inflation @xcite , they can be suppressed completely .",
    "an interesting question is whether the gravitational waves can be significantly enhanced compared to our naive expectations .",
    "recently it was argued that the contribution of tensor perturbations to the cmb anisotropy can be much greater than expected @xcite .",
    "however , it was found in @xcite that in the models considered in bartolo:2005jg , sloth:2005yx one can not avoid the production of too large scalar perturbations and therefore they are in contradiction with observations .",
    "it is also possible to produce blue - tilted spectrum of gravitational waves in a so - called superinflation @xcite , which is , however , plagued by graceful exit problem .    at present",
    "there exists no inflationary model with graceful exit where the b - mode of polarization would exceed that predicted by simple chaotic inflation .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to show that such models can be easily constructed even within the class of simple slow - roll inflationary scenarios if we allow a nontrivial dependence of the lagrangian on the kinetic term .",
    "these models resemble k - inflation with only difference that here inflation is due to the potential term in the lagrangian .",
    "the generic action describing a scalar field interacting with the gravitational field is@xmath0 ,   \\label{1}\\]]where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar and @xmath2 is a function of the scalar field @xmath3 and its first derivatives @xmath4we use planck units , where @xmath5 in the case of the usual scalar field the @xmath6dependence of @xmath7 is trivial , namely , @xmath8 while k - inflation and k - essence k - inflation , k - essence , book are based on the non - trivial dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath9 for @xmath10 , variation of the action ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to the metric gives the energy momentum tensor for the scalar field in the form of an ideal hydrodynamical fluid :   @xmath11here the lagrangian @xmath2 plays the role of pressure , the energy density is given by @xmath12where @xmath13 and the four - velocity  is@xmath14 let us consider a spatially flat friedmann universe with small perturbations : @xmath15 dx^{i}dx^{k } ,   \\label{4}\\]]where @xmath16 is the gravitational potential characterizing scalar metric perturbations and @xmath17 is a traceless , transverse perturbations describing the gravitational waves .",
    "the scale factor @xmath18 satisfies the friedmann equation@xmath19where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time @xmath20 taking into account that for the homogeneous background scalar field @xmath21 and that the energy conservation law is @xmath22we obtain the following equation for the scalar field@xmath23where the speed of sound  is @xmath24 ^{-1 } .",
    "\\label{ss}\\]]considering small scalar metric perturbations one can show that @xmath25 is in fact the speed of propagation of the cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "the stability condition with respect to the high frequency cosmological perturbations requires @xmath26 .",
    "it follows from ( [ 3 ] ) that inflation can be realized if the condition @xmath27 is satisfied for a sufficiently long time interval .",
    "this can be done in two ways .",
    "considering the canonical scalar field with @xmath28 , one can take a flat potential @xmath29 so that @xmath30 for more than 75 e - folds .",
    "this is the standard slow - roll inflation @xcite and in this case @xmath31 the other possibility is the k - inflation @xcite , where @xmath7 is a weakly dependent function of @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 is small . here",
    "inflation is entirely based on the kinetic term and it can take place even if the field is running very fast ( @xmath34 is large ) ; typically @xmath35 for k - inflation .    in this paper we consider a slow - roll inflation with a flat potential but in theories with a nontrivial kinetic term .",
    "to best of our knowledge this possibility has been ignored in the literature until now .",
    "however such models are very interesting because , as we will see , they allow us to have @xmath36 during inflation and thus enhance the tensor - to - scalar ratio for the perturbations produced .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath37 is manifestly lorentz - invariant and a superluminal speed of cosmological perturbations does not contradicts the principles of relativity .",
    "in fact , the superluminal propagation is possible only in the presence of the time - dependent homogeneous scalar field , which determines a preferable coordinate frame . only in this frame",
    "the speed can exceed the speed of light . as a result",
    "no violation of causality is possible .    for simplicity let us consider theories with lagrangian @xmath38 in this case @xmath39and the equation for scalar field becomes",
    "@xmath40it is clear that if the slow - roll conditions @xmath41are satisfied for at least 75 e - folds then we have a successful slow - roll inflation due to the potential @xmath42 in contrast to ordinary slow - roll inflation one can arrange here practically any speed of sound @xmath43 by taking an appropriate kinetic term . for example , for@xmath44we obtain from ( [ ss])@xmath45and if @xmath46 , then @xmath47 therefore by considering nontrivial kinetic terms @xmath48 one can have , in principle , an arbitrarily large @xmath49 which thus becomes an additional free parameter of the theory .",
    "the crucial point is that the amplitude of the final scalar perturbations ( during the postinflationary , radiation - dominated epoch ) depends on @xmath25 ( see , @xcite ) : @xmath50while the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes on supercurvature scales is given by @xmath51here it is worthwhile reminding that all physical quantities on the right hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ scp ] ) and ( [ tsr ] ) have to be calculated during inflation at the moment when perturbations with wave number @xmath52 cross corresponding horizon : @xmath53 for ( [ scp ] ) and @xmath54 for ( [ tsr ] ) respectively .",
    "the amplitude of the scalar perturbations @xmath55 is a free parameter of the theory which is taken to fit the observations .",
    "therefore , in models where @xmath36 , the energy scale of inflation must be higher than in ordinary slow - roll inflation with canonical kinetic term .",
    "moreover , it follows from ( [ tsr ] ) that the tensor - to - scalar ratio can be arbitrarily enhanced in such models .",
    "as a concrete example from the class of theories with enhanced tensor contribution let us consider a simple model with lagrangian @xmath56 -\\frac{% 1}{2}m^{2}\\phi ^{2 } ,   \\label{sm1}\\]]where constant @xmath57 is a free parameter . for @xmath58",
    "one recovers the lagrangian for the usual free scalar field .",
    "the function @xmath7 is a monotonically growing concave function of @xmath59@xmath60and the corresponding energy density , @xmath61 + \\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\\phi ^{2 } ,   \\label{sm2}\\]]is always positive . the effective speed of sound,@xmath62is larger than the speed of light , approaching it as @xmath63    in the slow - roll regime and for @xmath7 given in ( [ sm1 ] ) , equations ( [ fe ] ) , ( [ esf ] ) simplify to@xmath64taking into account that @xmath65 , we infer that during inflation @xmath66 is constant and @xmath67the speed of sound @xmath68can be arbitrarily large during inflation if we take @xmath69 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath70 is necessary for the existence of the slow - roll solution .",
    "hereafter we will use @xmath71 as a parameter instead of @xmath72 .",
    "one can easily find that during the slow - roll regime @xmath73and the pressure and energy density are given by @xmath74respectively .",
    "the inflation is over when @xmath75becomes of order unity , that is , at @xmath76 after that the field @xmath3 begins to oscillate and decays .",
    "the detailed analysis of dynamics and stability of the model will be given in @xcite .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to illustration of the above analysis by a phase diagram fig .",
    "[ phase ] obtained numerically .",
    "[ bl]@xmath77 [ bl]@xmath78 [ bl]@xmath79 [ br]@xmath80 [ l]@xmath81 [ br]@xmath82    numerically obtained phase portrait for the system with the parameters @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "the field value @xmath85 corresponds to the end of acceleration when @xmath86 . ]    to determine @xmath87 we use ( [ sm8 ] ) to rewrite the first equation in ( [ sm5 ] ) as@xmath88and obtain@xmath89where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the values of the scale factor and the scalar field at the end of inflation .",
    "given a number of e - folds before the end of inflation @xmath92 we find that at this time @xmath93and , hence , @xmath94does not depend on @xmath95 thus , for a given scale , which crosses the hubble scale @xmath96 e - folds before the end of inflation , the tensor - to - scalar ratio is @xmath97it is clear that by choosing @xmath57 close to the critical value @xmath98 we can have a very large @xmath71 and consequently enhance this ratio almost arbitrarily .",
    "we have shown above that in theories where the lagrangian is a nontrivial , nonlinear function of the kinetic term , the scale of inflation can be pushed to a very high energies without coming into conflict with observations . as a result",
    ", the amount of produced gravitational waves can be much larger than is usually expected . if such a situation were realized in nature then the prospects for the future detection of the b - mode of cmb polarization are greatly improved .",
    "of course , the theories where this happens are somewhat fine - tuned .",
    "namely , the corresponding lagrangian @xmath99 must generically satisfy the condition , @xmath100 during inflation . for the particular model ( [ sm1 ] ) this means that @xmath101 .",
    "this fine - tuning of the parameters of the theory should not be confused , however , with the fine - tuning of the initial conditions .",
    "in fact , the true theory of nature is unique and , for example , lagrangian ( [ sm1 ] ) , where @xmath102 is not very different from @xmath103 looks even more attractive because it has fewer free parameters .",
    "therefore , future observations of the cmb fluctuations are extremely important since they will restrict the number of possible candidates for the inflaton .",
    "the other peculiar properties of the generalized slow - roll inflation will be considered in @xcite .",
