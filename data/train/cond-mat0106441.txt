    "impurity substitution at the cu site in  high-@xmath0 cuprates@xcite has been considered to be a test probe for the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity and the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter [ 3 - 33 ] .",
    "it has also shed light on the recent striking issue of a normal - state pseudo - gap.@xcite the most important observation was that the non - magnetic zn ion suppressed @xmath0 somewhat more than magnetic ions such as ni for all kinds of hole - doped cuprates such as ( la , sr)@xmath5cuo@xmath10,@xcite yba@xmath5cu@xmath11o@xmath12,@xcite yba@xmath5cu@xmath13o@xmath14,@xcite and bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath14@xcite . the @xmath0 reduction rate for zn substitution was @xmath15 k/% and was higher for underdoped compounds than optimally or overdoped ones .",
    "this behavior of @xmath0 is strongly contrasted with that of conventional superconductors , where the reduction of @xmath0 is stronger for magnetic ion impurities , but nearly absent for nonmagnetic ion impurities .",
    "this difference led to the theoretical formulation of an unconventional pairing mechanism and a symmetry of the order parameter forhigh - temperature superconductor [ 16 - 27 ] .",
    "substitution at the cu site in ordinary high-@xmath0 cuprates with a charge reservoir block is generally not immune to structural distortion and/or charge carrier transfer between the charge reservoir block and the conducting cuo@xmath5 planes , which could affect @xmath0 dramatically . especially , one must be very cautious about the oxygen content when comparing the amounts of @xmath0 reduction directly .",
    "another complexity is due to the existence of several substitutable sites inside a unit - cell .",
    "electron - doped infinite - layer superconductors ( sr@xmath16ln@xmath17)cuo@xmath5 ( ln = la , sm , nd , gd , etc.)@xcite  have several incomparable merits for studying the effect of substitution for cu on @xmath0 . without a charge reservoir block",
    ", it has only the back - bone structure common to all high-@xmath0 cuprates , cuo@xmath5 planes separated only by a metallic spacer layer.@xcite the structure is robust , and oxygen is very stoichiometric and stable : buckling of the cuo@xmath5 plane , o interstitials and o vacancies were reported to be nearly absent.@xcite the @xmath0 has been found to be very robust against modifications of the structure and changes in the magnetic moment due to doping various lanthanide ions at the sr sites.@xcite thus , the substitution  for cu in the infinite - layer superconductors has the least possibility of changing @xmath0 via secondary routes , and observations should reveal a more intrinsic change in the @xmath0 of cuprate superconductors .",
    "however , difficulties in synthesizing high - quality sample has prohibited intense work on these infinite - layer superconductors.@xcite moreover , no work on the cu - substitution effect has been reported .",
    "recently , we succeeded in synthesizing high - quality ( sr@xmath1la@xmath2)cuo@xmath5.@xcite here , we report the effect of substitution for cu on the @xmath0  of the electron - doped infinite - layer superconductors sr@xmath1la@xmath2cu@xmath3_r_@xmath4o@xmath5 where _ r _ = zn and ni .",
    "we found that @xmath0  was nearly constant until @xmath6  for r = zn while the superconductivity was nearly suppressed for @xmath7  with @xmath8 k/% for ni .",
    "this feature is similar to those observed in conventional superconductors .",
    "starting materials of la@xmath5o@xmath11 , srco@xmath11 , cuo , and zno ( nio ) with a nominal composition were calcined at @xmath18 @xmath19c  for 36 hours with several intermittent grindings .",
    "a pelletized precursor sandwiched between two ti oxygen - getter slabs was put in a au or pt capsule .",
    "the capsule , together with an insulating wall and a graphite - sleeve heater , was closely packed inside a high - pressure cell made of pyrophillite .",
    "details of the sintering under high pressure is found elsewhere.@xcite the masses of the homogenous samples obtained in one batch were larger than @xmath20 mg .",
    "the low - field magnetization was measured in the zero - field - cooled state by using a squid magnetometer ( mpms_xl _ , quantum design ) at @xmath21 oe .",
    "the powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was measured using a rigaku x - ray diffractometer .",
    "energy dispersive spectroscopy ( eds ) using an electron probe microanalyzer and a field emission scanning electron microscope ( jsm-6330f , jeol ) were also used .",
    "figure [ xrdmt](a ) shows the x - ray powder diffraction patterns of sr@xmath22la@xmath2cu@xmath3zn@xmath4o@xmath5 , @xmath23 , 0.01 , 0.03 , and sr@xmath1la@xmath2cu@xmath3ni@xmath4o@xmath5 , @xmath24 0.01 and 0.02 .",
    "the intensity of each pattern was normalized to the intensity of the ( 101 ) peak and offset vertically for clear comparison .",
    "these xrd patterns show that a nearly single phase with an infinite - layer structure was formed .",
    "peaks corresponding to zn oxide , ni oxide , and la oxide could not be identified within the resolution .",
    "the smaller peaks at @xmath25 33.5@xmath19 and 37.5@xmath19 were also found to exist for unsubstituted pristine sr@xmath22la@xmath2cuo@xmath5 sample with nearly the same diamagnetic signal ; thus they do not correspond to zn oxide or ni oxide .",
    "the lattice constants are @xmath26 ( 3.950 )   and @xmath27 ( 3.410)for insulating srcuo@xmath5 ( superconducting sr@xmath1la@xmath2cuo@xmath5 ) .",
    "@xcite the expansion of the @xmath28-axis lattice constant is known to be due to the transfer of electron carriers to the cuo@xmath29 planes , and the shrinking of the @xmath30-axis lattice constant is simply due to the ionic size effect.@xcite the lattice constants from the xrd patterns in fig .",
    "[ xrdmt](a ) for sr@xmath1la@xmath2cu@xmath31ni@xmath32o@xmath5 and sr@xmath1la@xmath2cu@xmath33zn@xmath34o@xmath5  are @xmath35   and @xmath36   and @xmath37   and @xmath38  , respectively .",
    "the error bars are about 0.003  .",
    "we also examined whether zn was uniformly distributed within the samples of sr@xmath1la@xmath2cu@xmath3zn@xmath4o@xmath5 with @xmath39 .",
    "the microscopic composition of the samples was measured over tens of grains , each with a smaller detecting area of @xmath40 @xmath41m@xmath42 .",
    "the average diameter of a grain was about 10 @xmath41 m , and the zn concentration in the grains was @xmath43% .",
    "the average zn concentration was also closer to the nominal value .",
    "since the entire heating process was done inside a au capsule , a net loss of metallic ions is not likely to occur for the high - pressure synthesis technique . for other samples ,",
    "the resolution of the eds was rather insufficient to determine the stoichiometry .",
    "we measured  the low - field magnetization and calculated the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath44 , to determine the effect of substitution at the cu site on @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ xrdmt](b ) shows magnetic susceptibility , @xmath44 , curves for the above samples .",
    "the data for @xmath23  were from a previous result.@xcite for ni substitution , both @xmath0 and the superconducting volume fraction drastically decrease , and superconductivity nearly vanishes for a 2% substitution with an average @xmath0 reduction rate of @xmath45 k/% .",
    "this behavior was confirmed for several samples with @xmath46 .",
    "however , for zn substitution , the change in @xmath0 was less than about 2 k until @xmath6 where the superconducting volume fraction became less than about half that of the pristine sample . for samples with @xmath47 ,",
    "growth of singl - phase samples was very difficult .",
    "though we did not confirm the uniformness of ni inside the sample due to the resolution limit of eds , the result for @xmath48 should be a lower bound on the real value .",
    "the nearly total suppression of superconductivity in sr@xmath1la@xmath2cu@xmath31ni@xmath49o@xmath5 seems not to result from the lattice effect because the lattice constants remain much closer to those for superconducting sr@xmath1la@xmath2cuo@xmath5  than those for insulating srcuo@xmath5 .",
    "this means that the reduction of the electron carrier density in the cuo@xmath5 plane does not play a dominant role in killing the superconductivity .",
    "figure [ tcreduction ] shows the reduction rate , @xmath48 , for cu - site substitution in high-@xmath0 cuprates :  bi@xmath5sr@xmath5cacu@xmath5o@xmath14 , @xcite ( la , sr)@xmath5cuo@xmath10,@xcite yba@xmath5cu@xmath11o@xmath12,@xcite ( nd , ce)@xmath50cuo@xmath10,@xcite and ( sr@xmath1,la@xmath2)cuo@xmath5 . the open and the filled symbols represent the cases of ni and zn substitution , respectively .    as noted previously , the @xmath0 reduction rate is higher for zn substitution in 2-dimensional hole - doped cuprate superconductors , which occupies the majority of high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "however , this trend was first reversed for an electron - doped superconductor such as ( nd , ce)@xmath5cuo@xmath51 , which is just one step toward a conventional superconductor in terms of charge carrier type .",
    "our finding for ( sr@xmath1,la@xmath2)cuo@xmath52 seems to be the next step .",
    "two kinds of representative n - type cuprates show similar behaviors for the substitution effect on @xmath0 , ni killing the superconductivity faster than zn .",
    "however the difference is that the substitution effect in ( sr@xmath1,la@xmath2)cuo@xmath5 is much closer to those in conventional superconductors with respect to the exact value of the @xmath0 reduction rate @xmath48 .",
    "impurity substitution effects in hole - doped cuprates and electron - doped cuprates have been discussed in terms of the superconducting gap symmetry , _ d_-wave and _ s_-wave , respectively [ 16 - 27 ] .",
    "phase - sensitive josephson tunneling or the presence of a half flux quantum at the center of the tricrystal ring@xcite could be a direct test of _ d_-wave superconductivity , but would require high - quality thin films , which have not been feasible for infinite - layer superconductors due to difficulties in film growth .",
    "in addition , the pairing symmetry of the ( nd , ce)@xmath5cuo@xmath10 compound remains to be controversial.@xcite    many experimental observations indicate that ( sr@xmath1,la@xmath2)cuo@xmath5 has properties which are the most similar to those of conventional superconductors .",
