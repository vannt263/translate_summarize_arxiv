    "the idea of the seismogenic crust as a self - organized complex system was introduced over the years as a possible explanation for the widespread occurrence of space - time long - range correlations in earthquakes dynamics , similar to those observed in critical phase transitions @xcite . in general",
    ", the term self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite refers to the intrinsic tendency of a large class of spatially extended dynamical systems to spontaneously organize into a dynamical critical state .",
    "one signature of soc is the presence of both a power law behavior in earthquakes size distributions and a finite size scaling for their cutoffs . among the great number of different soc models @xcite developed in the last years",
    ", the ofc model @xcite , introduced by olami , feder and christensen in 1992 , has played a key role in modelling earthquakes phenomenology .",
    "however the presence of criticality in the non - conservative version of this model has been controversial since its introduction @xcite and it is still debated  @xcite , also in relation with the influence of topology . in literature ,",
    "ofc models on different topologies has been investigated , in particular the 2d nearest neighbor lattice ( nnl ) model @xcite , annealed random neighbor ( arn ) graph model and the ofc model on a quenched random ( qr ) graph @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our work is to study the effects of small - world ( sw ) and scale - free ( sf ) topologies on the criticality of the non - conservative ofc model .",
    "+ the paper is organized in the following way . in section [ ofcmodel ]",
    "we review the ofc model and we point out the main reasons that have induced us to study the non - conservative ofc model on sw and sf topologies . in section [ swnetwork ]",
    "we investigate the sw ofc model : in subsection [ swsize ] we show the earthquakes size distributions for the non - conservative sw ofc model and in subsection [ swfss ] we characterize the critical behavior of the model through the finite size scaling ansatz .",
    "finally , in section [ sfmodel ] we investigate the ofc model on a scale - free network , obtained by preferential attachment procedure @xcite .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the olami - feder - christensen ( ofc ) model @xcite is defined on a discrete system of @xmath0 sites ( blocks or of fault elements ) on a square lattice , each carrying a seismogenic force ( see fig . [ stress ] ) .",
    "such a force is simulated by associating to each site a real variable @xmath1 , which initially takes a random value in the interval @xmath2 .",
    "all the forces are increased simultaneously and uniformly ( mimicking a uniform tectonic loading ) , until one of them reaches the threshold value @xmath3 and becomes unstable @xmath4 .",
    "the uniform driving is then stopped and an `` earthquake '' ( or avalanche ) starts : @xmath5 where `` nn '' denotes the set of nearest - neighbor sites of @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 controls the level of conservation of the dynamics and , in the case of a graph with fixed connectivity @xmath8 , it takes values between @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 corresponding to the conservative case ) .",
    "the toppling rule ( [ av_dyn ] ) can possibly create new unstable sites , producing a chain reaction .",
    "all sites that are above threshold at a given time step in the avalanche relax simultaneously according to ( [ av_dyn ] ) and the earthquake is over when there are no more unstable sites in the system ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) .",
    "the uniform growth then starts again .",
    "the number of topplings during an earthquake defines its size , @xmath14 , and we will be interested in the probability distribution @xmath15 . in the following the boundary conditions of the model will be `` open '' , implying that @xmath16 on the boundary sites . + at this point it is important to emphasize that the ofc model behavior strongly depends on the chosen topology .",
    "for instance , in the dissipative nnl ofc model with open boundary conditions the earthquakes size distribution is described by a power law @xcite , characterized by a universal exponent @xmath17 independent of the dissipation parameter .",
    "however , at variance with the conservative case where a full soc behavior is observed , finite size scaling appears to be violated in the pdf cutoff - region ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "[ h ]     critical stress field of a 64x64 lattice ( nnl ofc model ) in the critical state.,width=359 ]     + in arn ofc models @xcite , where each site interacts with randomly chosen sites instead of its nearest neighbors on the lattice , there is criticality only in the conservative case , where it becomes equivalent to a critical branching process .",
    "as soon as some dissipation is introduced , the earthquakes become localized although the mean earthquakes size diverges exponentially as dissipation tends to zero and there is no power law distribution ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "actually it is interesting to point out that criticality in the ofc model on a lattice has been ascribed to a mechanism of partial synchronization  @xcite . in general",
    "the system shows a tendency to self - organize into a periodic state  @xcite which is frustrated by the presence of inhomogeneities such as the boundaries .",
    "in addition , inhomogeneities induce partial synchronization of the elements of the system building up long range spatial correlations and a critical state is obtained .",
    "the mechanism of synchronization requires an underlying spatial structure and therefore can not operate in an arn model , where each site is assigned new random neighbors at each update . + in the ofc model on a qr graph , where the choice of neighbors is not annealed but quenched and all the sites have exactly the same number of nearest neighbors @xmath8 ( both for @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , the dynamics organizes into a subcritical state .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in the ofc model on a nn lattice with periodic boundary conditions , where no critical behavior is observed at all @xcite . in the qr case , in order to observe scaling in the earthquakes distribution , one has to introduce some inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has been found that it is enough to consider just two sites in the system with coordination @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "when either of these sites topple according to rule ( [ av_dyn ] ) , an extra amount @xmath21 is simply lost by the system . in such a way spatial correlations",
    "can develop , because the topology is quenched , there is power law in earthquakes size distribution and also finite size scaling is observed ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "+   + in this work we study the non - conservative ofc model on both a small - world and a scale - free topology .",
    "+ first of all we expect that the inclusion of some inhomogeneities in the sites degree is not the unique way to obtain soc .",
    "indeed , as we are going to show , an alternative way is to keep fixed the sites degree and to change the topology of the underlying network , for instance by considering a small - world graph obtained by randomizing a fraction @xmath22 of the links of the regular nn lattice .",
    "here we will use the term `` small - world '' to refer to a rewired lattice ( with fixed connectivity ) with the minimum number of rewired links such that the characteristic path length @xmath23 is almost as small as that one for the corresponding random graph @xcite . as shown in the right panel of fig . [ rewiring ] ,",
    "this is obtained already for very small values of @xmath22 ( @xmath24 ) , much before the random graph limit ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "+ a small - world topology is expected to be a more accurate description of a real system according to the most recent geophysical observations that indicate that earthquakes correlation might extend to the long range in both time and space @xcite .",
    "in fact , if a main fracture episode occurs , it may induce slow strain redistribution through the earth crust , thus triggering long - range as well as short - range seismic effects @xcite .",
    "the presence of a certain percentage of long - range connections in the network takes into account the possibility that an earthquake can trigger other earthquakes not only locally but also at long distances .",
    "+ on the other hand , one can consider a different kind of networks with a small @xmath23 , the so called `` scale - free '' networks , which differ from the small - world graphs for having a power law distribution of the site degree .",
    "scale - free networks are very common in nature and have also been used for soc models ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for sandpile dynamics on sf network ) but they have not been investigated , as far as we know , in the context of ofc models . it is known that , when the connectivity is not fixed at all but only in average ( as for a random graph in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the strength of disorder is enough to destroy critical behavior .",
    "thus we expect that for sf networks , where the connectivity has a power law distribution , synchronization will not take place and it will be not possible for the ofc model to reach a critical state . in the last part of the paper we will show that this is exactly what happens .",
    "to investigate the effects of the small - world topology on the criticality of the non - conservative ofc model , we follow the method proposed by watts and strogatz to construct a network which interpolates between a square nn lattice and a quenched random graph @xcite .",
    "we start with a two - dimensional nn square lattice in which each site is connected to its @xmath26 nearest neighbors .",
    "the links of the lattice are rewired at random with a probability @xmath22 as in the one - dimensional model of ref .",
    "@xcite . the main differences with respect to the original model",
    "is that for any value of @xmath22 we want to keep fixed the connectivity of each site .",
    "for such a reason we have implemented a rewiring procedure as in fig.[rewiring ] in which the connections are rewired in couples .",

    "we decide whether to rewire this edge or to leave it in place .",
    "if the edge has to be rewired we ( a ) choose at random a second site @xmath30 and one of its edges , for instance the edge @xmath31 connecting site @xmath30 to site @xmath32 , and ( b ) we substitute the couple of edges @xmath28 and @xmath31 with the couple @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "+ we repeat this process by moving over the entire square lattice considering each site in turn until one lap is completed . in such a way",
    "the limit case @xmath25 is a qr graph with fixed connectivity ( q ) equal to @xmath26 . in the intermediate cases",
    "@xmath35 we can investigate the effects of an increasing number of long - range connections on the criticality of the model .",
    "indeed , at a critical region of the parameter @xmath22 between the regular ( @xmath36 ) and random ( @xmath25 ) networks , the topology produced by such a method exhibits a small - world behavior , characterized by the fact that the distance between any two sites on the graph is of the order of that for a random network and , at the same time , the concept of neighborhood is preserved , as for regular lattices . for this reason",
    ", we expect to obtain soc in a small - world topology ; the introduction of a few long - range edges create short - cuts that connect sites that otherwise would be much further apart .      in our simulations",
    "the starting point for the construction of the sw network is a two - dimensional square lattice @xmath37 with three different sizes : @xmath38 and @xmath39 ; the corresponding number of sites is @xmath40 .",

    "we plot the two exponents @xmath45 and @xmath46 as a function of the rewiring probability @xmath22 . here",
    "we report also the pdf for sf ofc model ( see sec .",

    "we notice that , increasing more and more the rewiring probability , the power law is practically lost .",
    "this can be better exploited by plotting the value of the two exponents @xmath45 and @xmath46 as a function of @xmath22 in the inset in fig.[stretched ] .",
    "indeed one can expect stretching - exponential in various cases of stochastic processes where many length scales appear .",
    "we note also that , above the value @xmath24 for which @xmath46 suddenly approaches @xmath49 , the power law for the pdfs progressively disappears . in the next subsection",
    "we will show that the cut - off in the earthquakes probability distribution scales with the system size ( the so called finite size scaling ansatz ) only around this rewiring threshold .      in order to characterize the critical behavior of the dissipative sw ofc model ,",
    "a finite size scaling ( fss ) ansatz is applied , i.e. @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a suitable scaling function and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are critical exponents describing the scaling of the distribution function . in fig .",

    "let us point out that on the sw rewired topology the system behaves as in the compact square lattice , but the occurrence of a small amount of long - range links disseminate the earthquakes over the network and the biggest earthquake size scales with the lattice .",
    "on the other hand , if we increase the amount of long - range links above a certain threshold ( @xmath54 ) , the mechanism of synchronization is corrupted and the scaling behavior disappears .",
    "finally we investigate criticality of the non - conservative ofc model on a scale - free network .",
    "it is an example of network displaying a small characteristic path length and a power - law distribution @xmath61 in the node connectivity k ( degree ) . by using the preferential attachment growing procedure introduced by barabsi and albert @xcite , we start from @xmath62 all to all connected nodes and at each time step we add a new node with @xmath63 links .",
    "these @xmath63 links point to old nodes with probability @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the degree of the node @xmath6 .",
