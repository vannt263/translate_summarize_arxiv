    "<S> we propose using a nonlinear phase shift interferometric converter ( npsic ) ( a new device ) for lumped compensation of the nonlinearity in optical fibers . </S>",
    "<S> the npsic is a nonlinear analog of the mach - zehnder interferometer and provides a way to control the sign of the nonlinear phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate a potential use of npsic for compensation of the nonlinearity to make a dispersion - managed system closer to an ideal linear system . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly npsic can be used to essentially improve single channel capacity in the nonlinear regime .     </S>",

    "<S> + the recent invention  @xcite and testing  @xcite of the dispersion management technique demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach for high speed communications . </S>",
    "<S> optical pulse dynamics in fiber links with dispersion management are governed by the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) with periodic coefficients :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the propagation distance , @xmath2 is an optical pulse amplitude , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is a first order group - velocity dispersion , @xmath5 is the nonlinear coefficient , @xmath6 is the nonlinear refractive index , @xmath7 is the carrier wavelength , @xmath8 is the effective fiber area that in general case depends on @xmath1 .    on short scales , the dispersion managed ( dm ) </S>",
    "<S> system is practically linear . </S>",
    "<S> linear transmission in an optical fiber is limited by a nonlinear distance @xmath9 , which is determined by the kerr nonlinearity @xmath10 and the characteristic pulse power @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic power can not be choosen too small in order to maintain appropriate value of the signal - to - noise ratio . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to attempt to extend the scale of the applicability of the linear regime . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved through use of a new optical fiber with lower kerr nonlinearity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another obvious approach is `` nonlinearity management '' , which was considered in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the semiconductor material waveguides with negative kerr nonlinearity proposed as an element for compensation of nonlinear phase shift are currently not practical . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we consider lumped compensation of the nonlinearity , the analog of lumped compensation of the chromatic dispersion by means of chirped fiber gratings . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the use of a nonlinear phase shift interferometric converter ( npsic ) as presented in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> the npsic consists of a silica - based fiber 1 , a highly nonlinear fiber 2 ( which could be chalcogenide glass based , having a kerr coefficient about 400 times or even much more than that for silica , see e.g. reference  @xcite ) , a linear amplifier a with amplitude amplification coefficient @xmath12 , and two directional couplers 1,2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is assumed that an optical terminator is installed at the end of the fiber 2 after coupler 2 to prevent beam reflection from the end of fiber 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the incident light with amplitude @xmath13 is split by the directional coupler 1 into two beams with amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , corresponding to the fibers 1 and 2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that total power is conserved : @xmath17 but a subsequent consideration can be easily generalized to include the directional coupler s and fiber s losses . </S>",
    "<S> the extra phase @xmath18 in the second fiber is due to light spliting in the directional coupler ( see e.g. reference  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical lengths @xmath19 in fibers 1 and 2 between couplers 1 and 2 are chosen in such a way that they provide a zero phase difference at the input of coupler 2 : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are effective linear refraction indexes in fibers 1,2 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath22 are small enough so that we can neglect the influence of dispersion in both fibers and the nonlinear phase shift in fiber 1 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the amplitudes of optical beams at the input of the coupler 2 are given by @xmath14 and @xmath23 , where the nonlinear phase shift @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to the value of @xmath10 in the highly nonlinear fiber 2 . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the propagation constants are the same for symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the coupler , the coupled - wave equation describing mode evolution in directional couplers can be written as@xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 are the coordinates of coupler 2 input and output respectively ; @xmath29 is the optical beam amplitude in fiber 1 at the exit of the coupler 2 and @xmath30 is a coupling coefficient which is assumed to be real in the lossless model . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of @xmath31 shows that npsic converts the @xmath32 into the output signal @xmath33 as follows @xmath34 where @xmath35 we assume that @xmath36 and expand @xmath37 in the eq . @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> neglecting @xmath39 terms results in @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the output amplitude @xmath33 of the linear system . </S>",
    "<S> thus by changing the npsic parameters @xmath42 , one can control the sign and magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> npsic can be considered as a nonlinear version of the mach - zehnder interferometer . as a typical example </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath43 which results in @xmath44 in @xmath45 line of a silica fiber we need to use npsic with @xmath46 of a highly nonlinear fiber provided that @xmath47 ( for this value of @xmath25 the nonlinear absorption is negligible in currently available chalcogenide glasses@xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this estimate is true if the power @xmath48 is constant throughout the propagation . in practice , </S>",
    "<S> power is not constant , due to fiber chromatic dispersion and losses . therefore , nonlinearity compensators must be distributed along the fiber with a separation distance less than the dispersion length @xmath49 and loss length @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a typical pulse width . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown below that the effective length of the nonlinearity is increased as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the number of lumped npsic on the dispersion map period . </S>",
    "<S> however , we demonstrate that for short pulses corresponding to strong dispersion management this approach is efficient only at relatively large value of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , this method displays good performance in the nonlinear regime , as , for example , inserting only two compensating elements on the period of the dispersion map could increase the bit rate per channel by a factor of two .    </S>",
    "<S> consider dm system with step - wise periodical dispersion variation : @xmath54 , @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( standard monomode fiber ) and @xmath57 for @xmath58 ( dispersion compensating fiber ) . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath59 is the path - averaged dispersion , @xmath60 are the amplitudes of dispersion variation subject to a condition @xmath61 , @xmath62 is a dispersion compensation period and @xmath63 is an arbitrary integer number . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 corresponding to standard monomode and dispersion compensating fiber . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that npsic units are located inside and at the ends of a dispersion compensated fiber at points @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 . at these points </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath71 experiences jump according to the eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 ; @xmath75 and @xmath76 mean the coordinate value just before and after the jump , respectively ; the parameters @xmath42 are chosen in such a way in order to to provide @xmath77 and @xmath78 for n=1 ,  , n-1 and @xmath79 here the term @xmath80 provides the compensation of the nonlinear phase shift both in standard monomode and dispersion compensating fibers .    assuming that the nonlinearity is small @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a dispersion map period </S>",
    "<S> , one can express @xmath2 in fourier domain as a product of an exact solution of linear part of the eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 , corresponding to mean - free dispersion @xmath84 , on a slow function @xmath85 : @xmath86 ( see reference  @xcite ) , where @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath88 is a slow function of @xmath1 on a scale @xmath82 which allows to integrate the eq . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath83 over the period @xmath82 neglecting the slow dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath1 and we get by taking into account the jumps in @xmath89 : @xmath90 where @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> a kernel @xmath94 is equal to the usual kernel of the path - averaged equation  @xcite : @xmath95 while @xmath96 accounts for the jumps in @xmath89 :    @xmath97/n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    suppose that full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath51 of @xmath98 is subject to the condition @xmath99 then @xmath100 can be rewritten as :    @xmath101.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus comparing @xmath102 with the kernel @xmath103 of the usual path - averaged equation we get an extra small factor @xmath104 provided that @xmath53 is big enough to ensure the condition @xmath105 for short pulses @xmath53 should be a big number to make the system close to the linear one . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the dependence of the fwhm @xmath106 obtained after propagation of the initial zero - chirp gaussian pulse with @xmath107 over a typical transoceanic distance @xmath108 on the number of npsic units @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> this dependence is obtained by numerical intergation of the nls equation  @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse is lunched to the dm fiber at @xmath110 with the peak power @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> dm system parameters are @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the system can be approximately considered linear for @xmath113 in which case the nonlinear correction to @xmath106 is less @xmath114 .    a strong variation of @xmath106 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 for small @xmath53 is due to the attraction of the initial gaussian pulse to soliton solution @xmath115 of path - averaged eq . @xmath116 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath117 is a soliton propagation constant . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this soliton solution as the modified dm soliton ( mdm soliton ) by analogy with the dm soliton , that corresponds to the usual path - average equation ( without nonlinearity management ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath118 we recover the usual dm soliton of the path - averaged equation  @xcite where the dm soliton width @xmath119 depends on @xmath120 only for @xmath121 ( see e.g. reference  @xcite ) . for the above mentioned system parameters @xmath122 any shorter pulses experience strong distortion because of the nonlinearity for @xmath123 curve 2 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows the pulse power distribution after @xmath124 of propagation of the initial gaussian pulse with @xmath107 ( curve 1 ) . using npsic units we can control @xmath96 and thus change @xmath125 of mdm soliton . </S>",
    "<S> curve 3 shows the pulse power distribution after @xmath126 for a system with two npsic for each dm period @xmath82 located at the ends of the dispersion compensating fiber with @xmath127 , where f=3/2 . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that curve 3 is close both to the initial gaussian pulse ( curve 1 ) and to the mdm soliton ( curve 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mdm soliton was obtained by numerical iteration of the equation @xmath116 with @xmath128 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical iteration scheme is similar to the one used in reference  @xcite for usual path - averaged equation . by changing the factor </S>",
    "<S> @xmath129 one can control @xmath125 of the mdm soliton . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath130 , which corresponds to a negative average nonlinearity of the total system , the numerical iteration scheme finally diverges indicating that the mdm soliton is a rather long - lived quasi - stable structure which however serves as an attractor of the pulse dynamics on a scale @xmath131    in summary , the use of npsic elements would allow one to construct a nearly linear fiber transmission system . </S>",
    "<S> however this system requires many npsic elements . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the use of npsic elements offers the better advantages to fiber links operating in nonlinear regime . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , only a few elements per dipersion map period could dramatically reduce pulse width and potentially increase bit - rate .    </S>",
