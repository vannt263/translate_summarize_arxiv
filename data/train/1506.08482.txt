    "high mobility two dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) in gaas / algaas heterostructures have provided some of the earliest evidence for the existence of electronic nematic liquid crystals @xcite .",
    "in such a nematic , electron - electron interactions can stabilize a phase with translational invariance but spontaneous orientational order .",
    "if the orientational order is pinned by a weak symmetry - breaking field ( arising from the host crystal structure , or applied externally ) , the resistivity of the electron system becomes anisotropic , a readily observable signature . that such phases can arise out of a collection of point - like electrons , in contrast to a conventional nematic liquid crystal composed of elongated molecules ,",
    "is remarkable .    electrical transport experiments @xcite on ultra - clean gaas - based 2dess revealed that a strong anisotropy in the longitudinal resistivity develops at temperatures below about @xmath0 mk when a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath1  has positioned the fermi level near half filling of the second ( or a few higher ) excited landau level ( ll ) .",
    "this anisotropy contrasts sharply with the observed isotropy of the resistivity , in the same samples , at half filling of the ground and first - excited ll , where electron - electron interactions lead to strongly correlated phases lacking orientational order , and at zero and low magnetic field where interactions are generally weak and the 2des behaves semi - classically .",
    "these early observations are in qualitative agreement with prior theoretical work @xcite , at the hartree - fock level , which predicted the existence of charge density wave ( or `` stripe '' ) phases at half - filling of the same lls as found in experiment",
    ". additional theoretical work , incorporating quantum and thermal fluctuations , led to the prediction that static long - range stripe order was likely absent , being replaced , via a kosterlitz - thouless transition , by nematic orientational order at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "there is both experimental and additional theoretical support for this scenario @xcite .",
    "an important aspect of the experimental observations of the nematic phases in 2dess that is not understood is their consistent orientation relative to the crystalline axes of the host gaas lattice . in all but a very few cases @xcite ,",
    "the observed transport anisotropy is oriented such that the measured resistivity is large when the mean direction of the current flow is parallel to the @xmath2  crystal axis and small when the current flow is parallel to @xmath3 , thus suggesting that the stripes align parallel to @xmath3 .",
    "since the crystalline symmetry of bulk gaas provides no distinction between the orthogonal @xmath2  and @xmath3  directions , the experimental observation of just such a distinction must arise from the fact that the 2des resides not in pristine bulk gaas , but instead in a complex semiconductor heterostructure grown one atomic layer at a time . in particular , the absence of mirror symmetry across the 2des plane in such heterostructures opens the door to a distinction between @xmath2  and @xmath3 , even if it does not identify the mechanism whereby the nematic phases sense that distinction @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report on how the nematic phases respond to two types of controlled modification of heterostructure symmetry . in the first",
    ", we examine the nematic phases in a set of samples in which the 2des is confined to a single quantum well that is either doped symmetrically or asymmetrically . in this way",
    "we show that in these samples the sign of the local perpendicular electric field experienced by the 2d electrons does not alter the orientation of the nematic phases . in the second set of experiments , the distance between the 2des and the surface of the heterostructure is the controlled variable .",
    "here we find that if the 2des is confined in a quantum well , the orientation of the nematic phases in our samples is unaffected by the distance to the surface .",
    "in contrast , when the 2des is confined at a single heterointerface , we find that the stripes lie along the `` normal '' direction ( _ i.e. _ parallel to @xmath3 ) , when the surface is fairly close to the heterointerface , but along @xmath2  when the surface is more remote .",
    "we discuss these results in the context of the various symmetry - breaking mechanisms that have been proposed theoretically to be responsible for the orientation of the quantum hall nematic phases .",
    "the samples used in this work are conventional modulation - doped gaas / algaas heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) on @xmath4-oriented gaas substrates .",
    "a total of 13 independently grown samples have been examined .",
    "ten of these are single gaas quantum wells embedded in the alloy al@xmath5ga@xmath6as .",
    "silicon delta - doping layers in the alloy are set back a distance @xmath7 above and @xmath8 below the quantum well and populate it with a high mobility two - dimensional electron system .",
    "these quantum well samples comprise three groups , a , b , and c , of three samples each , ( a@xmath9 , a@xmath10 , a@xmath11 ; b@xmath9 , b@xmath10 , b@xmath11 ; and c@xmath9 , c@xmath11 , c@xmath10 ) , plus one additional sample d@xmath9 . for samples",

    "the doping asymmetry @xmath7:@xmath8 is 1:4 ( 4:1 ) in samples a@xmath10  and c@xmath10  ( a@xmath11  and c@xmath11 ) and 1:1.7 ( 1.7:1 ) in sample b@xmath10  ( b@xmath11 ) .",
    "as intended , the measured @xcite electron density in the 2des in the group a and group c samples , and in sample d@xmath9 , are nearly identical , ranging from @xmath15 to @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the density in the three group b samples ranges from @xmath18 to @xmath19 @xmath17 .",
    "the width of the quantum well is @xmath20 nm for the group a and c samples , 32 nm for the group b samples , and 28.3 nm for sample d@xmath9 .",
    "in addition to these quantum well samples , three single heterointerface samples , h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , and h@xmath23 , were examined . in these ,",
    "the 2des resides on the gaas side of an interface between a gaas and al@xmath24ga@xmath25 .",
    "a single si delta - doping layer in the algaas is positioned @xmath26 nm above the interface .",
    "the measured @xcite 2des density in these three samples ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath28 @xmath17 .",
    "for all six group a and b samples , and for samples d@xmath9  and h@xmath21 , the distance @xmath29 between the upper si delta doping layer at the sample top surface is @xmath30 nm , for the three group c samples and sample h@xmath22 , this `` cap layer '' thickness was increased ten - fold to @xmath31 nm . finally , for sample h@xmath23 , @xmath32 nm . in none of the samples was an additional doping sheet placed within the cap layer .",
    "although the low temperature electron mobility among the 13 samples varied from 6 to @xmath33 @xmath34/vs , all exhibited robust transport signatures of the fractional quantized hall effect and , most importantly , the quantum hall nematic phases at @xmath35 and 11/2 filling factor .",
    "( since the degeneracy of a single , spin - resolved ll is @xmath36 , @xmath37 corresponds to half - filling of the lower spin branch of the @xmath38 second excited ll @xcite . )",

    ". the crystallographic orientation of each sample is unambiguously established by one or more methods , including visual inspection of known surface defects @xcite .",
    "the samples are mounted on a rotation stage and thermally anchored to the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the rotation stage allows the magnetic field supplied by a superconducting solenoid to have components both perpendicular ( @xmath1 ) and , when needed , parallel ( @xmath42 ) to the 2des plane .",
    "the in - plane field @xmath42  is directed along the @xmath3  crystallographic direction .",
    "eight diffused in ( or in - sn ) ohmic contacts positioned at the corners and side midpoints of each sample enabled standard low frequency ac electrical transport measurements .",
    "excitation currents were kept small enough ( typically 10 na ) to avoid electron heating .",
    "the measurements reported here focus on the longitudinal resistances @xmath43  and @xmath44  of the nematic phase at @xmath45 , with the @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions corresponding to the @xmath2  and @xmath3  crystallographic axes , respectively . for these measurements , two opposing side midpoint",
    "ohmic contacts are used to inject and withdraw current , while the voltage difference between the two corner contacts on one side of the mean current flow axis is recorded .",
    "typically , @xmath43  and @xmath44  can differ by factors of order a few , even at high temperatures and at zero magnetic field .",
    "we attribute this to contact misalignments , inhomogeneities in the 2des density , and other mundane sources . in any case , this effect in no way interferes with the identification of the nematic phases since the latter exhibit vastly larger differences between @xmath43  and @xmath44  that are highly temperature and filling factor dependent .",

    "the temperature evolution of the resistive anisotropy at @xmath45 is displayed in fig .",
    "1b . above @xmath53 mk @xmath43  and @xmath44  are only weakly temperature dependent , with @xmath43  exceeding @xmath44  by about a factor of 3 , comparable to the difference seen around @xmath52 . in contrast , as the temperature is reduced @xmath43  grows rapidly while @xmath44  falls .",
    "this rapid onset of extreme anisotropy is characteristic of the nematic phases at half - filling of the @xmath54 landau levels .",
    "no analogous effect is seen at @xmath52 or @xmath55 in the @xmath50 ll or at @xmath56 or @xmath57 in the @xmath58 lowest ll @xcite .    as reported earlier @xcite , a relatively small in - plane field , directed along the @xmath3  axis , is sufficient to interchange the hard and easy transport directions of the nematic phases .",
    "theoretical analysis @xcite has shown that the in - plane magnetic field , through its mixing of landau levels and quantum well subbands , creates an extrinsic rotational symmetry breaking potential that competes with the native symmetry breaker responsible for the orientation of the resistive anisotropy at @xmath42=0 . indeed ,",
    "the `` critical '' in - plane magnetic field , @xmath59 , needed to reorient the anisotropy provides a measure of the strength of the native symmetry breaking potential ; @xmath601 mk per electron being typical .",
    "however , as we explain below , difficulties arise when comparing @xmath59  among samples with differing structures .",
    "to a good approximation , the density of electrons transferred from a si delta - doping layer in an algaas alloy across an interface to gaas is simply @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the distance between the doping layer and the interface , @xmath63 the conduction band edge offset at the interface , and @xmath64 the alloy dielectric constant @xcite .",
    "the validity of this approximation relies on the dopant concentration being large enough to pin the fermi level in the si layer close to the conduction band edge .",
    "we have found that it provides a highly successful design rule for a wide variety of 2d electron systems in gaas - based heterostructures .    for a single",
    "quantum well doped from both sides , the donors create a perpendicular electric field at the location of the 2des given approximately by @xmath65 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the doping setback distances .",
    "since in the same approximation the total electron density in the 2des is given by @xmath66 we have @xmath67 @xmath68 is a convenient quantitative measure of the asymmetry of the potential well confining the 2des . here and below , a _ positive _ electric field points along the mbe growth direction .",
    "the nine quantum well samples in groups a , b , and c were designed specifically to determine whether confinement asymmetry was important in determining the orientation of the quantum hall nematic phases .",
    "using eq . 1 and the doping setbacks listed in table i , the donor electric field at the 2des is @xmath69 v / m for samples a@xmath11  and c@xmath11   ( a@xmath10  and c@xmath10 ) and @xmath70 v / m for sample b@xmath11  ( b@xmath10 ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath71 for samples a@xmath9 , b@xmath9 , and c@xmath9 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath43  and @xmath44  around @xmath45 at @xmath48 mk in all six samples in groups a and b. the large transport anisotropy characteristic of the nematic phase is clearly evident in all of the samples .",
    "furthermore , in all cases @xmath43@xmath72@xmath44  at @xmath45 , demonstrating that the stripe orientation is the same in all six samples . from these data",
    "we conclude that local symmetry of the potential confining the 2des in these quantum well samples does not determine the orientation of the quantum hall nematic phase at @xmath45 . though not shown in the figure , the same conclusion applies to the group c samples , and to the nematic phase at @xmath73 in all nine samples .      dangling bonds at the physical surface of ga - based heterostructures create mid - gap states which pin the fermi level about @xmath74 mev below the gaas conduction band edge @xcite . in our samples",
    "the single si delta - doping layer between the surface and the buried quantum well ( or heterointerface ) transfers electrons both to the quantum well _ and _ to the sample surface to bring the conduction band edge down to the fermi level in the si donor layer . as a result",
    ", there is a perpendicular electric field , of magnitude @xmath75 , in the cap layer .",
    "we note that this electric field does not affect the calculated donor electric field @xmath68 discussed in the previous section .",
    "while all group a and group b quantum well samples have cap layers with thickness @xmath30 nm , the three group c quantum well samples have a cap layer that is almost ten times larger : @xmath31 nm .",
    "for the group a and b samples @xmath76 v / m , whereas for the group c samples @xmath77 v / m . in spite of this large difference",
    ", the orientation of the quantum hall nematic phase in the group c samples is the same as in groups a and b ; the hard transport direction is @xmath2 .",
    "apparently , the cap layer thickness does not affect the orientation of the nematic phases , at least in these quantum well samples .",
    "remarkably , this conclusion does not carry over to the single heterointerface samples , h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 , and h@xmath23 , that we have examined .",
    "figure 3 displays data from samples h@xmath21  and h@xmath22 . for sample h@xmath21 , @xmath30 nm , while for sample h@xmath22 , @xmath31 nm",
    "; these are the same thicknesses which distinguish the group a and b quantum wells from the group c samples .",
    "now we find that the transport hard axis at @xmath45 is along the `` usual '' direction , @xmath78 @xmath2 , in sample h@xmath21 , but along @xmath3  in sample h@xmath22 .",
    "the same finding applies to the nematic phase at @xmath73 . since the 2des density",
    ", doping setback @xmath7 , and mobility in these two samples are nearly the same , it seems that the one structural difference between the two , the cap layer thickness @xmath29 , must be responsible for the differing orientation of the nematic phase .",
    "consistent with this , the third single heterointerface sample , h@xmath23 , for which @xmath32 nm , also exhibits the hard transport axis along @xmath3 .",
    "we emphasize that beyond these two thick cap heterointerface samples ( h@xmath22  and h@xmath23 ) , there has , to our knowledge , been only one other reported example @xcite of a 2d electron system in which the hard transport axis of the @xmath45 nematic phase is along @xmath3  instead of @xmath2  ( absent a symmetry - breaking in - plane magnetic field . )      as mentioned in section iic , a small in - plane magnetic field @xmath42  directed along @xmath3  is often sufficient to interchange the hard and easy transport directions of the quantum hall nematic phases @xcite .",
    "this interchange occurs when the extrinsic symmetry - breaking potential due to the in - plane field overcomes the native potential responsible for orienting the nematic phase at @xmath42=0 .",
    "the magnitude ( and sign ) of the extrinsic @xmath42-induced potential is highly sensitive to the details of the quantum well confining the 2des @xcite .",
    "figure 4 compares the @xmath42  dependence of the resistive anisotropy in the @xmath45 nematic phase in the symmetrically doped sample a@xmath9  to that in its asymmetrically doped partner samples , a@xmath10 , and a@xmath11 .",
    "the figure reveals that the critical in - plane field @xmath59  is considerably larger in the asymmetric samples than in the symmetric sample .",
    "it therefore seems that either : a ) the native symmetry - breaking potential orienting the @xmath45 nematic phase in samples a@xmath10  and a@xmath11  is stronger than it is in sample a@xmath9 , or b ) the extrinsic symmetry - breaking potential due to the in - plane field is weaker in samples a@xmath10  and a@xmath11  than it is in sample a@xmath9 .",
    "the in - plane magnetic field creates its symmetry - breaking effect by mixing electric subbands of the confinement potential with the landau levels arising from the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the energy splitting @xmath79  between the ground and first excited electric subband is therefore crucial , with larger splittings leading to a weaker @xmath42  effect .",
    "the calculated @xcite values of this splitting are @xmath79  = 11.4 mev for the symmetric sample a@xmath9 , and @xmath79  = 13.3 mev for the asymmetric samples a@xmath10  and a@xmath11 . to investigate whether this modest difference is sufficient to explain the large discrepancy in the @xmath59  values between sample a@xmath9  and samples a@xmath10  and a@xmath11 , an additional symmetric quantum well sample was grown and studied .",
    "structurally , sample d@xmath9  differs from sample a@xmath9  only in the width of the quantum well : 28.3 nm vs. 30 nm , respectively .",
    "the two samples have very nearly the same 2des density and both clearly exhibit the quantum hall nematic phases with the hard transport axis along @xmath2 .",
    "the calculated subband splitting in sample d@xmath9  is @xmath79  = 13.1 mev ; as intended this is close to that in the two 30 nm asymmetric samples , a@xmath10  and a@xmath11 . as fig .",
    "4 shows , the interchange of the resistive anisotropy axes at @xmath45 in sample d@xmath9  occurs at @xmath59  = 0.6 t. this is much larger than the @xmath59   = 0.25 t seen in sample a@xmath9 , and not far from the values found in samples a@xmath10  and a@xmath11 .",
    "these results demonstrate the sensitivity of the in - plane field effect to the details of the 2des confinement potential and suggest caution in interpreting the magnitude of @xmath59 .",
    "figure 5 plots the observed @xmath59  values versus the calculated values of @xmath79 for all ten quantum well samples in this study @xcite .",
    "the solid circles represent the symmetrically doped samples , the open circles those asymmetric quantum wells for which @xmath14 , and the open diamonds the asymmetric wells for which @xmath13 .",
    "the symbols are blue for the group a samples , red for group b , black for group c , and green for sample d@xmath9 . not surprisingly , since the group a and c samples have the same doping profiles and nearly equal electron densities , their calculated subband splittings are very similar . the symmetrically - doped samples a@xmath9  and c@xmath9  exhibit almost identical critical fields , @xmath59  @xmath80 t. the asymmetric samples a@xmath10 , a@xmath11 , c@xmath10 , and c@xmath11  show considerable variation in the critical field ( to which we return below ) but , as already mentioned , @xmath59  is substantially larger than in the symmetric samples a@xmath9  and c@xmath9 . on average ,",
    "these asymmetric samples exhibit a @xmath59  close to that observed in sample d@xmath9 .",
    "the group b samples , with their wider quantum wells ( 32 nm _ vs. _ 30 nm ) and smaller doping asymmetries ( 1.7:1 _ vs. _ 4:1 ) , have very nearly equal calculated subband splittings @xmath79 and measured critical fields @xmath59 .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates that , as expected , @xmath59  rises quickly with @xmath79 .",
    "there have been several suggestions for the origin of native symmetry - breaking field responsible for the consistent orientation of the quantum hall nematic phases in 2d electron systems in gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "takhtamirov and volkov @xcite and rosenow and scheidl @xcite suggested that anisotropy in the conduction band effective mass , due to the asymmetric confinement field in single heterointerfaces , was responsible .",
    "fil @xcite pointed out that the piezoelectricity of gaas explains why a one - dimensional charge density modulation in the 2des prefers to lie along @xmath2  _ or _",
    "@xmath3 , as opposed to , say , @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "subsequently , fil @xcite argued that interference between the piezoelectric and deformation potential electron - phonon couplings lifts the degeneracy between @xmath2  and @xmath3  in a complicated way strongly dependent on the depth of the 2des from the surface of the heterostructure .",
    "more recently , koduvayur _ et al . _ @xcite have claimed that strain , in particular that arising from the electric field @xmath82 in the piezoelectric cap layer , explains the orientation of the nematic phases in both 2d electron and 2d hole systems @xcite . finally , sodemann and macdonald @xcite have argued that a combination of rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interactions leads to a native symmetry - breaking potential which orients the nematic phases either along @xmath2  or @xmath3  depending upon the sign of the asymmetry of the 2des confinement potential ( which controls the sign of the rashba interaction ) .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "2 clearly demonstrate that the symmetry of the confinement potential does not dominate the native symmetry - breaking potential responsible for orienting the quantum hall nematic phases @xcite .",
    "this is consisent with an earlier report which compared the orientation of the @xmath45 nematic in a symmetric quantum well sample with that found in a single heterointerface sample @xcite .",
    "thus it appears that both the anisotropic effective mass models @xcite and the recent spin - orbit model @xcite are of at most secondary importance to the native symmetry - breaker .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "5 shows that the critical field @xmath59  for interchanging the resistive anisotropy axes is larger in sample a@xmath11  than it is in sample a@xmath10 , and larger in sample c@xmath11  than in sample c@xmath10 .",
    "these four samples are asymmetrically doped quantum wells , with @xmath83 in samples a@xmath11  and c@xmath11 , but @xmath84 in samples a@xmath10  and c@xmath10 .",
    "this might imply that the symmetry - breaking potential does contain a term proportional to the sign of the asymmetric donor electric field @xmath68 .",
    "although not strong enough to determine the orientation of the nematic , this term would influence the net strength of the symmetry - breaking potential , and thereby affect @xmath59 .",
    "while appealing , we believe this conclusion is premature .",
    "first , we note that the asymmetric quantum well samples b@xmath11  and b@xmath10  exhibit essentially identical @xmath59  values .",
    "although the donor electric fields in these group b samples are a factor of 2 less than those in the asymmetric group a and c samples ( @xmath85 _ vs. _ @xmath86 v / m ) , a symmetry - breaking term proportional to @xmath68 should have shown up in samples b@xmath11  and b@xmath10 .    alternatively , the variation in @xmath59  values among the group a and c asymmetrically doped samples might be due to unintentional structural differences among these samples .",
    "for example , the doping asymmetry of samples a@xmath11  ( c@xmath11 ) and a@xmath10  ( c@xmath10 ) might not be simply opposite in sign , but also differ in magnitude .",
    "indeed , an `` upward '' diffusion of si donors during mbe growth would reduce the effective value of @xmath8 and increase that of @xmath7 .",
    "while our growth procedure is designed to minimize this effect , it is unlikely to be wholly absent . in any case ,",
    "such diffusion would increase @xmath79 in samples where @xmath14 and decrease it in samples where @xmath13 . since @xmath59  increases with @xmath79 , this diffusion mechanism might explain why @xmath59  is larger in sample a@xmath11  ( c@xmath11 ) than in sample a@xmath10  ( c@xmath10 ) . while the same diffusion effect would exist in the group b samples",
    ", it would have much less effect since the calculated subband splittings already show little sensitivity to the doping asymmetry .",
    "we turn now to our observations regarding the cap layer thickness @xmath29 .",
    "first , irrespective of its orientation , the quantum hall nematic phase is clearly observed in samples c@xmath9 , c@xmath11 , c@xmath10 , h@xmath22 , and h@xmath23 , in all of which the 2des lies more than 1 @xmath87 m below the physical surface of the heterostructure @xcite .",
    "this is an order of magntitude larger than the period @xmath88 of the charge density modulation of the `` stripe '' phases predicted by hartree - fock theory @xcite .",
    "for example , at @xmath45 , @xmath89 , with @xmath90 the magnetic length ; @xmath91 nm in our samples .",
    "this observation thus discounts orientational symmetry - breaking mechanisms which rely on a nearby physical surface @xcite .",
    "our findings also impact the recent suggestion @xcite that piezoelectric strain , created by built - in electric fields in complex gaas / algaas heterostructures , governs the native symmetry - breaking potential .",
    "for example , sample a@xmath9  and c@xmath9  are both symmetrically doped 30 nm quantum wells .",
    "their 2des densities , @xmath92 and @xmath16 @xmath17 ; subband splittings , @xmath79  = 11.4 and 11.2 mev ; and critical in - plane fields , @xmath59  = 0.25 and 0.27 t ; respectively , are all virtually identical . both exhibit strong quantum hall nematic phases , with hard transport in the usual direction : @xmath2 .",
    "however , as mentioned in section iii - b , the thickness and perpendicular electric field in the cap layer of these two samples differ by a factor of almost 10 : @xmath93 nm and @xmath94 v / m in sample a@xmath9 , but @xmath31 nm and @xmath95 v / m in sample c@xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the strain induced by the electric field @xmath82 in the cap layer is almost ten times smaller in sample c@xmath9  than it is in sample a@xmath9 .",
    "from this we conclude that piezoelectric strain in the cap layer due to fermi level pinning at the surface is not the dominant source of the native symmetry - breaking potential in our quantum well samples .",
    "in surprising contrast , the cap layer thickness strongly influences the symmetry - breaking potential in our single heterojunction samples .",
    "both thick cap samples we examined , h@xmath22  and h@xmath23 , exhibited well - developed quantum hall nematic phases with their hard transport direction along @xmath3 .",
    "these two samples , along with the unusual sample employed zhu _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , are the only reported examples of 2d electron systems in which the quantum hall nematic phases are oriented in this manner , at least in the absence of external perturbations or second subband occupation @xcite . in their experiment , zhu _ et al .",
    "_ employed a top - gated undoped single heterointerface . in this density - tunable sample , the hard axis of the @xmath45 nematic",

    "although the mechanism for this switching is unknown , it is interesting to note that the electric field @xmath82 in the cap layer of their sample was _ negative _ at all 2des densities , with the switching observed for @xmath97 v / m . in our heterointerface samples , the hard axis of the @xmath45 nematic switched from @xmath2  to @xmath3  when @xmath82 was reduced from @xmath98 to @xmath99 v / m .",
    "hence , in both experiments the switching is observed as @xmath82 is changed in the same sense .",
    "the relationship , if any , between these observations remains to be investigated .",
    "the single heterointerface results reported here suggest that the net native symmetry - breaking potential includes multiple contributions .",
    "one of these could be piezoelectric strain due to the the electric field @xmath82 in the cap layer @xcite .",
    "this would be in competition with strain arising from the oppositely directed electric field @xmath100 in the doping setback region between the si donors and the heterointerface and the average electric field @xmath68 experienced by the 2d electrons themselves .",
    "this last electric field might also contribute to the symmetry - breaking potential via the spin - orbit or effective mass anisotropy effects @xcite mentioned above .",
    "the strain due to the cap layer electric field might determine the orienation of the nematic phases in the thin cap heterointerface sample h@xmath21 , while these other effects win in the thick cap samples h@xmath22  and h@xmath23 .",
    "while appealing , this scenario conflicts with our results in the quantum well samples .",
    "for example , the two asymmetrically doped samples a@xmath10  and c@xmath10  differ only in their cap layer thicknesses : 110 nm _ vs. _",
    "1010 nm , respectively .",
    "their large doping asymmetries result in electric fields in the quantum well and the top doping setback region which are the same sign and close in magnitude to those in the single heterointerface samples h@xmath21  and h@xmath22 .",
    "nevertheless , in contrast to samples h@xmath21  and h@xmath22 , these two quantum wells both display nematic phases with hard transport axes along @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , as already mentioned , the symmetric quantum well samples a@xmath9  and c@xmath9 , in which the electric fields in the top and bottom doping setbacks cancel and the average field in the quantum well itself vanishes , show the same orientation for the nematic ( and essentially the same critical magnetic field @xmath59 ) in spite of their very different cap layer thicknesses .",
    "the different dependence upon cap layer thickness of the single heterointerface and quantum well samples presents an intriguing puzzle .",
    "it suggests , perhaps not surprisingly , that the material both above and below the 2des plays a role in the net native symmetry - breaking potential experienced by the nematic phases . in the single interface samples ,",
    "the 2des sits atop a thick ( typically @xmath101 m ) layer of gaas whereas in the quantum well samples there are relatively thick algaas alloy layers both above and below the thin gaas quantum well containing the 2des . in both kinds of samples , these structures are supported by a `` cleaning '' superlattice consisting of many alternating thin layers of gaas and algaas and a gaas buffer layer directly atop the gaas substrate .",
    "certainly , the net strain profile and detailed electronic structure in these two types of many - layered heterostructures differ in detail and could be quite challenging to model quantitatively @xcite .",
    "we have here reported on an extensive set of experiments , involving 13 distinct samples , designed to elucidate the nature of the native symmetry - breaking potential which orients the quantum hall nematic phases that emerge at low temperature and high landau level occupancy in clean 2d electron systems in gaas .",
    "although the fundamental origin of the symmetry - breaking potential has not been determined , our findings significantly constrain theoretical models of it .",
    "in particular , we have found the orientation of the quantum hall nematic to be insensitive to the sign of the perpendicular electric field @xmath68 at the location of the 2des .",
    "this electric field , through its coupling to the orbital and spin - orbital degrees of freedom of the 2des , has been suggested as responsible for the orientation of the nematic phases @xcite .",
    "in addition to the local symmetry of the 2des confinement potential , we have also examined the quantum hall nematic phases in samples with varying distances @xcite between the 2des and the physical surface of the heterostructure . increasing the cap layer thickness @xmath29 from 0.1 @xmath87 m to 1.0 @xmath87 m was observed to have no effect on the orientation of the nematic phases in our quantum well samples but , remarkably , to interchange the hard and easy transport directions in our single heterointerfaces .",
    "while these opposite findings demonstrate that the cap layer thickness is not a reliable predictor @xcite of the orientation , they do prove that a nearby surface is not essential for the robust pinning of it @xcite and , at the same time , open an interesting avenue for future research .",
    "finally , we have shown that the re - orientation of the transport anisotropy axes of the nematic phases due to an applied in - plane magnetic field @xmath42 , while fundamentally well - understood @xcite , is not well - suited as a quantitative tool for comparing the strength of the native symmetry - breaker among disparate samples . in particular ,",
    "our measurements have shown that even a small change in the energy splitting between subbands in the confinement potential can significantly alter the critical in - plane field @xmath59  needed to re - orient the nematic phase .",
