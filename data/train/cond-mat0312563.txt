    "many structures in the biological world grow so slowly that they adopt a shape that can be considered as a minimizer of some configurational energy associated solely with the _ internal _ structure .",
    "the logarithmic spiral of the nautilus shell is an example .",
    "it enlarges through a process of differential growth whereby its shape represents the accumulated history of identical events , save for scale changes  @xcite .",
    "thus , the microscopic rules of growth are essentially unchanging as the three - dimensional form develops , and the properties of the external environment do not fundamentally determine the form .",
    "environmental effects on the development of biological forms are well known .",
    "consider the formation of tendril perversions in climbing vines  @xcite .",
    "a perversion is a junction between regions of opposite helix handedness that forms as an initially straight tendril first attaches to a support structure and then , through the activation of tension - sensitive receptors , undergoes a helical instability .",
    "the constraint of fixed ends enforces the formation of a structure with zero net twist , consisting of concatenated regions of opposite chirality joined by a transition region  the perversion .",
    "thus , the interaction with the external environment fundamentally alters the pattern formation through the tension induced by a point contact .",
    "even more complex phenomena occur for those structures whose very process of growth induces an _ external _ force , as with motion through an environment that offers viscous resistance .",
    "these new forces can dramatically alter the ultimate configuration , and the present paper is a case study in such phenomena .",
    "we focus on a system in which the formation of patterns occurs through a finite - wavelength instability in which the process of growth introduces an intrinsic time dependence to the control parameters .",
    "the resulting bifurcation problem is nonautonomous and can exhibit a rich phenomenology as the intrinsic time scale of growth competes with those of the various modes of instability . this competition places the problem among the class of so - called  dynamic bifurcations , \" of which many examples are of continuing interest .",
    "these include instabilities in directional solidification in which the initial acceleration of the interface from rest provides the nonautonomous character @xcite , fingering instabilities of magnetic fluids under the influence of time - dependent magnetic fields @xcite , and separatrix crossing in hamiltonian systems viewed as models for stellar fission @xcite .",
    "motivation for this focus comes from the phenomenon of supercoiling exhibited by filamentous colonies of _ bacillus subtilis _ and other bacteria . _",
    "b. subtilis _ cells are rod - shaped bacteria , typically four microns in length and slightly over one - half micron in diameter .",
    "wild - type rod - shaped bacteria grow by extending along the cylindrical axis of symmetry , and then dividing and separating in the middle  @xcite . under certain conditions ,",
    "the cells of some mutant forms fail to separate upon replication , leading to a long chain of cells .",
    "other species have also been observed to form chains , including _ escherichia coli _",

    "helical ( or , in the jargon of dna biophysics ,  solenoidal \" ) morphologies have also been observed  @xcite . of these examples ,",
    "the supercoiled structures of _ b. subtilis _ have been studied most extensively  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental work @xcite has indicated that the cell wall of _ b. subtilis _ contains helical protein structures .",
    "these may supply the molecular imprinting responsible for this morphological development , in a manner analogous to the way microtubules control macroscopic handedness in certain plants @xcite , but as of yet no successful microscopic theory for the formation of these supercoiled structures exists .",

    "moreover , material cross - sections of the cells rotate relative to each other @xcite , so that the angle describing the relative orientation of any two material cross - sections is proportional to their exponentially increasing separation . in one of the earliest observations of supercoiling in _ b. subtilis _ ,",
    "the ends of the fiber adhered to a spore coat , prohibiting axial rotation of the ends  @xcite .",
    "mendelson supposed that this blocked rotation leads to torsional stress , eventually causing supercoiling  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ expt_loop ] ) . since this discovery",
    ", it has been shown that adhesion is not required for supercoiling @xcite , and that many different factors such as temperature , ph , and the concentration of ions such as magnesium and ammonium affect the morphology of the coils  @xcite . the evolution of the coils after the formation of the first braid is remarkable .",
    "the first plectonemic braid , essentially a filament that is two cells thick , continues to grow and eventually reaches a critical length of order 100 @xmath0 m , after which it supercoils to form another braided structure which is four cells thick .",
    "this process can repeat many times , leading to a hierarchy of braids and eventually a macroscopic object .    in this paper",
    ", we study in detail mendelson s blocked rotation mechanism of supercoiling in a growing closed loop , and focus on the formation of the initial braid . while not yet explaining the microscopic physical origin of the coiling instability , we elucidate the rich dynamics that occurs when growth competes with blocked rotation , and thereby help constrain more detailed theories .    with this focus",
    "we exploit several simplifying assumptions in our analysis .",
    "first , the chain of cells is treated as an elastic filament with uniform properties along its length .",
    "there is evidence that this assumption holds until times comparable to a few doubling times ( @xmath5 ) , but may be violated later .",
    "for example , when the chirality of nutrient molecules in the growth medium is reversed , the supercoils unwind and even begin to wrap up in the opposite handedness , but the hairpin bends from the original braid remain  @xcite .",
    "thus , some of the deformation of the growing filament becomes permanent .",
    "this phenomenon is reminiscent of the morphological development of plant tendrils , in which young and flexible tendrils age with time , becoming woody and locked in a fixed shape  @xcite . on the time scales that will concern us , @xmath6 , single fibers have been shown to behave like elastic rods , with a bending modulus @xmath7 erg - cm  @xcite , as discussed further in section  [ constit ] .",
    "a second major simplification we introduce is to treat the growth rate as constant in time , independent of stress and filament geometry .",
    "again , the permanent hairpin bends in the chirality reversal experiment show that this assumption can not hold everywhere along the filament for all times after the first braid forms .    together with the observation that viscous effects dominate inertial effects in the low reynolds number environment of the growing fibers , these assumptions lead to the model studied in this paper : an elastic ring with intrinsic twist suspended in a viscous fluid and lengthening at an exponential rate .",
    "our work is complementary to that of other investigators .",
    "for example , shelley and ueda studied the euler - like buckling of a growing liquid crystal filament , using a local drag model for the linear stability of a growing loop  @xcite , and incorporating nonlocal stokesian hydrodynamics to study the pattern formation  @xcite .",
    "drasdo studied similar patterns in the context of the growth of single - cell - layer tissue sheets  @xcite .",
    "klapper has studied inertial writhing instabilities of _ open _ rods subject to exponential growth , as well as the relaxation to equilibrium of twisted rings in the absence of growth  @xcite . goriely and",
    "tabor  @xcite introduced the idea of _ twist depletion _ as a possible mechanism driving buckling in _",
    "b. subtilis_.    our analysis begins with a generalization of the kinematics and dynamics of slender filaments to account for growth .",
    "section  [ grow_elas_loop ] treats the growing elastic loop , beginning with a qualitative discussion of the instability .",
    "the linear stability analysis is greatly simplified by the use of the natural frame , so in this section we include a self - contained summary of the properties of the natural frame .",
    "we present a quasi - analytic treatment of the linear stability of the loop , and then present numerical simulations of the full nonlinear problem .",
    "section  [ conclude ] is the conclusion .",
    "in this section we extend the standard kinematics and dynamics of elastic rods to allow for growth .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the arclength measured at time @xmath9 from one end of an open rod , or from a fixed material point for a rod closed to form a loop .",
    "then @xmath10 is the position in space of the centerline of the rod with arclength coordinate @xmath8 at time @xmath9 . since material points on the rod centerline are convected along the rod by growth , fixed values of @xmath8 do not correspond to fixed material points .",
    "we choose to label the material points of the centerline at all times by the arclength parameterization @xmath11 at a fixed time @xmath12 .",
    "we will study exponential growth , for which @xmath13 .",
    "note that the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath8 and @xmath9 commute because @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent variables : @xmath14 however , @xmath15 and @xmath16 do not commute since @xmath17 by the chain rule .",
    "the velocity of a material point is the time derivative of position at fixed @xmath11 , @xmath18 it is convenient to develop the equations of motion in terms of @xmath8 rather than @xmath11 , so that @xmath19 to avoid confusion , we will explicitly denote which variables are fixed when finding the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath9 .",

    "( [ convect1 ] ) corresponds to the velocity of the centerline in the absence of growth , and the second term arises from growth - induced convection .",
    "henceforth we will specialize to exponential growth , for which @xmath21 and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the unit tangent vector of the centerline .",
    "although the velocity of a material point may seem from eq .",

    "( [ v - eqn ] ) shows that the velocity is manifestly independent of this choice .",

    "( [ convect2 ] ) implies that @xmath24 .",
    "is tangent to the rod centerline .",
    "the other members of the orthonormal frame , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , point to material points on the rod s surface.,height=192 ]      in kirchhoff rod theory  @xcite , the configuration of a rod is completely specified by the orientation of the material orthonormal frame @xmath27 .",
    "the vectors @xmath25 and @xmath26 point to material points on the rod surface ( fig .  [ mat_frame ] ) . as the rod bends and twists , the positions of these material points change , causing the material frames to rotate  @xcite : @xmath28 the vector @xmath29 describes the bending and twisting strain at a given instant , and @xmath30 is the angular velocity of a material frame at a given material point @xmath11 . in general ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 depend on the choice of material frame .",
    "once the choice is made for a given configuration , say the stress - free state , then the choice is specified for all configurations . in the classical rod theory without growth ,",
    "it is natural to align @xmath25 and @xmath26 with the principal axes of the cross - section . if the cross - section is circular , as we henceforth assume , and if the rod is straight in the absence of stress , then there are many equivalent natural choices .",
    "for example , if the rod aligns along the @xmath31-axis when it is stress - free , then @xmath32 is natural .",
    "any uniform rotation of this frame about @xmath33 is equally convenient ; all these choices lead to @xmath34 in the absence of stress .",
    "if the rod is curved in the stress - free state , then the direction of curvature breaks the rotational symmetry of the circular cross - section and provides a natural choice for the directions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "_ e.g. _ , if the rod has a helical stress - free state , then we may take @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the unit normal and binormal of the frenet - serret frame  @xcite : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the curvature and @xmath41 the torsion . thus , @xmath42 for this frame in the absence of stress , where @xmath43 is the curvature and @xmath44 is the torsion of the helix .",

    "first , even though the ultimate microscopic mechanism for the supercoiled patterns of _ b. subtilis _ fibers is unknown , the blocked rotation mechanism we study here must play a role in the supercoiling of closed fibers .",
    "for example , since the closed loops form supercoils at lengths which are much shorter than the length at which the open fibers supercoil  @xcite , we expect that the blocked rotation mechanism dominates over whatever mechanism causes the open fibers to supercoil .",
    "thus , we can directly compare our calculations with the experiments on the supercoiling of closed filaments .",
    "recalling the parameters of section  [ buck - writhe ] , we estimate @xmath368 , so that we expect unbranched plectonemes when @xmath369 , branched plectonemes when @xmath370 , and solenoids when @xmath371 .",
    "typical observations of the filaments yield unbranched plectonemes , but branched plectonemes and solenoids also arise , depending on the growth medium . using the observed buckling radius for an unbranched plectoneme , in section  [ buck - writhe ] we were able to estimate @xmath180 cm@xmath4 , suggesting the presence of a structure in the cell wall with pitch @xmath372 cm .",
    "the observations of helical actin - like polymers in the cell wall with comparable pitch  @xcite support our estimate , and further suggests a starting point for a theory for the microscopic mechanism of the supercoiling .",
    "the second major conclusion of our work is the dynamical nature of the pattern selection . for large @xmath361 ,",
    "the plectonemes remain once growth ceases , and are qualitatively similar to the minimizers of the elastic energy , although the rate of growth plays an important role in determining the shape . for small @xmath361 ,",
    "the solenoids are transient structures which relax away when growth halts .",
    "since the curvature of the bacterial fibers can become permanent  @xcite , the solenoidal shapes may act as a template for patterns which remain in the absence of growth .",
    "this mechanism of pattern formation via the hardening of transient structures formed from the interplay of flexibility and external friction may apply to other biological systems , such as those studied in  @xcite .    to help justify , refine , or rule out our model , we suggest three basic experiments .",
    "first , the shape of a growing loop as function of time should be measured precisely enough to compare with our theory .",
    "although our numerical results ( fig .  [ energy_shapes ] ) are qualitatively similar to the experimentally observed shapes ( fig .  [ expt_loop ] ) , the lack of detailed information about the evolution in time of a single loop in  @xcite prevents a stringent test of our theory .",
    "second , the change in elastic properties with time during growth should be quantitatively measured .",
    "for example , to what degree and how long must a fiber be bent to develop a permanent curvature ? finally , the nature of the twist stress in a growing fiber with free ends should be determined .",
    "is there a twist moment on the cross sections of the growing fibers with free ends , leading to a writhing mechanism qualitatively similar to the blocked rotation mechanism for closed loops , or is the mechanism for open fibers completely different ?",
    "future progress toward understanding the pattern formation of _ b. subtilis _ , both at the microscopic level of the structure of the cell wall and the more macroscopic level treated here , depends critically on new experiments such as these .",
