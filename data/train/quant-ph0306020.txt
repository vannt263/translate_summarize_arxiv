    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) @xcite is a widespread method used for generation of entangled pairs of photons .",

    "the angular spectrum is also transferred from the pump beam to both down - converted beams , as examined , e.g. , in ref .",

    "placing linear polarizers into both hom interferometer arms enables demonstration of violation of bell s inequalities , measuring correlations of mixed signal and idler photons from the pair as a function of the two polarizer settings @xcite .",
    "franson @xcite suggested another experiment . by use of two spatially",
    "separated interferometers , one can observe a violation of bell s inequalities for position and time .",
    "first high - visibility interference experiments of this type were performed using michelson interferometer @xcite , reaching a visibility of 87% .",
    "later experiments utilized spatially separated mach - zehnder interferometers to measure nonlocal interference @xcite .",
    "interference was observed also in mixing of signal photons produced by spdc in two nonlinear crystals @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that when the optical path difference through this interferometer exceeds the coherence length , interference appears as a spectrum modulation .",
    "finally , complementarity between interference and a which - path measurement was studied for the case of down - converted light in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to study the correlations of energies of the two photons from the entangled pair directly . to achieve this goal , we place a mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer in the idler beam and set the optical - path difference larger than the coherence length of the idler photons .",
    "thus , no interference pattern is observed upon modulation of the optical - path difference on a scale of the wavelength . if a narrow frequency filter were placed in the idler beam in front of the mz interferometer , the coherence length would be effectively prolonged and the interference pattern would be observed .",
    "similarly , placing a scanning filter in front of one detector at the output of the mz interferometer , one could observe an intensity modulation of particular frequency component , because individual frequency components of the field interfere independently and the filter selects just one quasi - monochromatic portion of them .",
    "however , there is no filter in the idler - beam path containing the mz interferometer in the setup described in this paper .",
    "we place the narrow frequency filter in the signal beam and observe an effective prolongation of the coherence length in the mz interferometer and a substantial increase of visibility in a coincidence - count measurement .",
    "this prolongation is the consequence of the correlation of energies of the two beams @xcite .",
