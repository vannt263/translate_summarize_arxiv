    "the quantization of the linear automorphisms of the two - torus ( cat maps ) was first developed by hannay and berry  @xcite , who were able to determine the quantum propagators for the subgroup of @xmath2 defined by @xmath3 this set of matrices is often known as the _ theta group_. it turns out that it is possible to associate to every element of @xmath2 a propagator  @xcite , or quantum map , which is a unitary operator acting on a finite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "however , the multiplication among propagators of different cat maps can be defined only if the quantization is restricted to certain subgroups of @xmath2 , which depend on the periodicity conditions imposed on the quantum wavefunction ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it turns out that the theta group is the largest of these subgroups .",
    "an exact form of egorov s theorem characterizes the quantum cat maps , which , as a consequence , are _ multiplicative _ up to a phase factor , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the propagator , @xmath6 is a subgroup of @xmath2 and @xmath7 is the dimension of the hilbert space in which @xmath5 acts .",
    "in other words , the quantization determines a _ projective _ representation of @xmath6 , which is sometimes referred to as _",
    "representation_.    in their original paper , hannay and berry conjectured that the quantization of the cat maps is multiplicative in the theta group , i.e. it defines a proper representation .",
    "the importance of this property was emphasized by kurlberg and rudnick  @xcite , who proved that if we restrict to the congruence subgroup defined by @xmath8 for @xmath7 odd and @xmath9 for @xmath7 even , where @xmath10 denotes the @xmath11 identity matrix , then it is possible to choose the propagators so that the quantization is multiplicative .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to prove that there exists a choice of phases of the propagators @xmath5 that determines a proper representation of the whole theta group .",
    "we also give an explicit expression for these phases .",
    "the multiplicativity of the propagators is strictly related to the existence of a set of unitary operators  known as hecke operators in analogy with a similar phenomenon in the theory of modular surfaces  that commute with the map and among themselves .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that multiplicativity implies the existence of these symmetries .",
    "most of the mathematical properties of the quantum cat maps , like the degeneracy in their spectra , are due to the hecke operators .",
    "kurlberg and rudnick  @xcite proved that the set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map and of its hecke symmetries ( the hecke eigenfunctions ) become equidistributed in the semiclassical limit with respect to liouville measure .",
    "they also obtained rigorous results on the value distribution and extreme values of a particular class of hecke eigenfunctions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hecke operators are responsible for spectral statistics of a significant class of perturbations of the quantum cat maps that , although being consistent with distributions of eigenvalues of random matrices , do not belong to the universality classes expected from the symmetries of the classical dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows . in section  [ qcm ]",
    "the quantum cat maps are introduced and the main results are presented .",
    "the implications of the quantization defined in this paper on the structure of the hecke operators are described in section  [ rem ] .",
    "section  [ alpr ] is devoted to the proof of multiplicativity for the theta group . in sections  [ md2 ] and [ rmult ]",
    "we determine a choice of quantum propagators that defines a proper representation of the theta group .",
    "this will also give an alternative proof of multiplicativity .",
    "the cat maps are the linear automorphisms of the two - torus @xmath12 .",
    "their dynamics may be represented by the action of elements of the modular group @xmath2 modulo one . in other words , we consider the symplectic map @xmath13 the torus plays the role of phase space , therefore the coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 are taken to represent the position variable and its conjugate momentum .",
    "the action of @xmath16 on @xmath17 can be interpreted in terms of the discrete time evolution of a dynamical system , thus the corresponding quantum dynamics is determined by a unitary operator @xmath5 . when @xmath18 , the dynamics generated by the classical map is hyperbolic .",
    "since the phase space is compact , the hilbert space @xmath19 on which @xmath5 acts is finite dimensional and may be identified with @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the ring of congruence classes modulo @xmath7 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath19 and planck s constant are related via the condition @xmath22 .",
    "( we refer the reader to appendix  b for more details on the quantization of maps on the torus . )",
    "there are many standard ways of mapping classical observables @xmath23 into operators @xmath24 acting on @xmath19 .",
    "however , elements of @xmath2 can not be quantized using these techniques because , although they are symplectic , they can not be interpreted as a one - time flow of a hamiltonian on @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they need an _ ad hoc _ quantization procedure . since we are considering linear systems , it is natural to require that the quantum and classical evolution commute , or , more precisely , that an exact form of egorov s theorem holds : @xmath25 an alternative way of understanding   is the following . the operator @xmath24 can be expressed as a linear combination of elements of an irreducible representation @xmath26 with a given central character @xmath27 of a finite heisenberg group @xmath28 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) . because of the stone - von neumann theorem , there exists a unique isomorphism class of irreducible representations of @xmath28 with central character @xmath27 .",
    "then , @xmath29 can be projected into an automorphism of @xmath28 that fixes the centre , and thus the map @xmath30 , with @xmath31 , defines an irreducible representation @xmath32 as long as the two central characters are the same , i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "these two representations must be isomorphic . the intertwining operator @xmath34 from @xmath26 to @xmath35 is known as quantum propagator of @xmath16 . because of schur s lemma , @xmath5 is unique up to a phase factor .",
    "many approaches have been developed to determine @xmath5  @xcite , which , because of  , are all equivalent up to phase factors .",
    "the topology of the torus constrains the quantum wavefunction to be periodic up to a phase factor in both the position and momentum representations , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 elements of @xmath2 can be quantized only when @xmath39 and @xmath40 are rational numbers and , given a @xmath41 , the quantization is restricted to a certain subgroup of @xmath2 ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath42 , then the maps that can be quantized belong to @xmath1 .",
    "these restrictions are due to the constraint that the central characters @xmath27 and @xmath43 of the two irreducible representations @xmath26 and @xmath35 must be the same .",
    "the theta group has index three in @xmath2 and is the largest subgroup of @xmath2 that can be quantized once the periodicity conditions have been fixed , in the sense that when @xmath44 the quantization is restricted to groups of higher index in @xmath2 . in this article",
    "we shall consider only the case when @xmath45 , i.e. the wavefunction is exactly periodic in both position and momentum representations .",
    "it is easy to see that egorov s theorem determines a projective representation of @xmath1 .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove that it is possible to define a proper representation of @xmath1 .",
    "we have the following result .    [ th1 ] for any positive integer @xmath7 , there exists a choice of phases in the definition of the propagators @xmath5 such that @xmath46 a choice of propagators that realizes   is the following . if [ operators ] @xmath47 then the propagator is the discrete fourier transform : @xmath48(q ) : = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{q ' \\bmod n } \\rme \\left(\\frac{\\pm q q'}{n } \\right)\\phi(q ' ) , \\quad \\phi \\in { \\mathcal{h}_n}.\\ ] ] the parity matrix @xmath49 has the obvious quantization @xmath50(q):= \\phi(-q ) , \\quad \\phi \\in { \\mathcal{h}_n}.\\ ] ] if @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 then we have @xmath53(q ) : = \\rme\\left(\\frac{\\pm mq^2}{2n}\\right)\\phi(\\pm q ) , \\quad \\phi \\in { \\mathcal{h}_n}.\\ ] ] similarly , if @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 then we set @xmath56(q ) : = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } \\sum_{q ' \\bmod n }   \\rme\\left(\\frac{\\pm 1}{2n}\\left(wq^2 - 2 q q ' \\right)\\right)\\phi(q ' ) , \\quad \\phi \\in { \\mathcal{h}_n}.\\ ] ] in all the other cases we define @xmath57(q ) : = \\frac{h(a , b)}{\\sqrt{n_b } } \\sum_{q ' \\bmod n } g\\left(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma(q , q')\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ \\quad \\times \\rme\\left(\\frac{1}{2nb}\\left(dq^2 - 2 q q '   + a { q'}^2\\right)\\right)\\phi(q ' ) , \\quad \\phi \\in { \\mathcal{h}_n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are defined in equations   and   respectively .",
    "formula   needs a few words of explanation .",
    "firstly , we have @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the jacobi symbol ( see appendix a for the definition and properties of the jacobi symbol ) and @xmath62 is the sign function @xmath63 the function @xmath58 is a phase factor which distinguishes definition   from the quantization that hannay and berry introduced in their original article  @xcite . more precisely , hannay and berry s propagator is @xmath64 .",
    "the term @xmath65 is a normalized gauss sum : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the greatest common divisor of @xmath71 and @xmath7 , which we shall always take to be positive . in the previous definitions , in   and in what follows we use the notation @xmath72 the sum   is different from zero only if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are coprime integers , @xmath75 is also an integer and @xmath76 is even .",
    "@xmath59 can be explicitly computed : @xmath77 here @xmath78 denotes the inverse integer of @xmath15 modulo @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath14 are mutually prime , i.e. the only integer modulo @xmath14 such that @xmath79 moreover , the euler - fermat theorem gives @xmath80 where @xmath81 is euler s function , which is defined as the number of integers less than and mutually prime to @xmath14 .",
    "( for a detailed explanation of   and   we refer the reader to  @xcite . )",
    "it was pointed out by hannay and berry  @xcite that the gauss sum   is invariant if @xmath82 the reason is quite simple : if @xmath83 is a function defined on @xmath84 , then the sum @xmath85 is invariant if @xmath86 , where @xmath87 .",
    "the substitutions   are equivalent to replacing @xmath88 by @xmath89 in  .",
    "similarly , we have the equality @xmath90 which is proven in appendix c.    it is straightforward to check that the operators  ,  ,   and   satisfy  ; it was shown by knabe  @xcite and degli esposti  @xcite that the propagator introduced by hannay and berry  @xcite , and therefore also definition  , obeys an exact form of egorov s theorem . thus , the quantization procedure that we gave defines a projective representation of @xmath1 . in the following sections we will prove that it is proper representation . in section  [ rem ] we will show that the definitions of the propagators ( 2.3 ) depend only on the reduction of @xmath16 modulo @xmath91",
    "therefore , since the projection @xmath92 is surjective ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , formulae ( 2.3 ) also define a representation of the group @xmath93    there exist partial results in the direction of the first part of theorem  [ th1 ] .",
    "the first goes back to schur  @xcite , who proved that when @xmath15 is an odd prime , any projective representation of @xmath94 can be modified to give a representation .",
    "an analogous result was obtained in  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the same property holds for @xmath95 when @xmath96  @xcite .",
    "kurlberg and rudnick  @xcite proved that there exists a choice of propagators that defines a representation of the congruence subgroup @xmath97 similar results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the quantum cat maps are characterized by the existence of a group of commutative unitary symmetries known as hecke operators .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , these symmetries are responsible of most of the arithmetical properties of the quantum cat maps .",
    "since theorem  [ th1 ] has important consequence on the structure of such operators , we briefly introduce them and describe how they are related to the propagators defined in formulae  ( 2.3 ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ th1 ] will be presented in the following sections .",
    "if two cat maps are equivalent modulo @xmath98 , then their quantum propagators differ by a phase factor .",
    "this property was already discovered by hannay and berry  @xcite and is a direct consequence of formulae  .",
    "kurlberg and rudnick s  @xcite quantization is a map @xmath99 so by construction , if @xmath100 then @xmath101 .",
    "thus , multiplicativity implies the existence of hecke operators .",
    "in fact , suppose that @xmath102 , then we have @xmath103 i.e. @xmath104 is a symmetry of @xmath105 , even though @xmath16 and @xmath106 do not commute exactly .",
    "kurlberg and rudnick  @xcite proved that the map   can be defined in such a way that @xmath107 is a proper representation when restricted to the congruence subgroup @xmath108 .",
    "they also proved that given @xmath109 the number of elements of @xmath108 that commute with @xmath16 and among themselves is of order @xmath7 .",
    "we conclude by showing that the propagators defined in formulae ( 2.3 ) depend only on the reduction of @xmath16 modulo @xmath91 and therefore they define a proper representation of @xmath110 . as a consequence , in this case",
    "the hecke symmetries of a quantum cat map @xmath5 are those @xmath111 such that @xmath112 the order of the group of hecke symmetries of a given @xmath5 is of order @xmath7 also in this case .",
    "this follows directly from kurlberg and rudnick s result , which implies that the number of equivalence classes of matrices modulo @xmath91 in @xmath113 that commute modulo @xmath91 among themselves and with a given @xmath16 is of order @xmath7 .",
    "since @xmath114 is of finite order in @xmath1 , the same statement holds in @xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that the reduction modulo @xmath91 in this respect is essential , because the only matrices that commute exactly with @xmath115 are @xmath116 and the powers of the primitive matrix of @xmath16   is primitive if @xmath117 , @xmath118 , implies @xmath119 . ] .",
    "it also is important to point out that if there exists a choice of phases in the definition of the propagators such that @xmath120 then @xmath5 and @xmath111 commute for any choice ; this is not the case with the multiplicativity property  .",
    "finally , we have the following .",
    "[ cor1 ] the propagators @xmath5 defined in formulae ( 2.3 ) depend only on the reduction of @xmath16 modulo @xmath91 .",
    "it is trivial to see that the propagators   and   are invariant if @xmath121 and @xmath122 . now , suppose that @xmath123 and @xmath5 and @xmath111 are of the form  .",
    "we have @xmath124 where @xmath125 is a matrix with integer entries .",
    "the propagators of both sides of   are @xmath126 where @xmath127 . we know",
    "that @xmath128(q)=\\rme(\\mu)\\phi(q ) , \\quad \\phi \\in { \\mathcal{h}_n}.\\ ] ] the phase factor @xmath129 can be determined directly from   and  : @xmath130 now , since @xmath131 , from property   of the jacobi symbol we have @xmath132    more generally , using   one can show that if @xmath133 then @xmath134(q)={\\biggl(\\begin{array}{c } n \\\\ \\hline { \\left | a \\right | } \\end{array}\\biggr)}\\phi(aq ) , \\quad \\phi \\in { \\mathcal{h}_n}.\\ ] ] corollary  [ cor1 ] then follows immediately .",
    "it is also important to point out that if @xmath100 , then @xmath135 however , since @xmath136 , the jacobi symbol @xmath137 is not necessarily one .",
    "given an abstract group @xmath6 , it is always possible to choose a subset @xmath138 such that each element of @xmath6 can be written as product , or string , of a finite number of @xmath139 , i.e. @xmath140 , @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "we call @xmath144 a set of generators",
    ". the cardinality of @xmath144 may be finite or infinite ; the groups that we are concerned with are all finitely generated .",
    "it is clear that if we choose appropriately a set of generators of @xmath1 and then we understand how their propagators behave , we may be able to make some progress on the multiplicativity properties of arbitrary elements of @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , knowing a set of generators , say @xmath145 , one might be tempted to think that if the @xmath146 obey   and we define @xmath147 then multiplicativity would be automatic .",
    "this would be the case if @xmath1 were a _ free _",
    "group , i.e. if no relations existed among the generators or , in other words , if each element of @xmath1 could be written in a unique way as a finite product @xmath148 , each @xmath149 being some @xmath150 , where @xmath151 .",
    "however , in general a given @xmath152 can be written in many different ways as product of generators and one must check that such relations hold among the @xmath146 too .    the main result of this section is the following .",
    "[ th2 ] the group @xmath1 is generated by the set of matrices @xmath153 , where @xmath154 the only relations among @xmath155 are @xmath156 furthermore , if @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 are given by  , and , then the following relations hold : @xmath160    this theorem automatically gives @xmath161 once @xmath5 is defined according to  .",
    "however , @xmath5 is given implicitly as product of propagators of generators and this may be inconvenient in applications .",
    "we shall address this issue in sections  [ md2 ] and [ rmult ] .",
    "the statement that @xmath162 is a set of generators of @xmath1 with relations   is a direct consequence of well known results in the theory of modular forms ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , since it is fundamental to our work , we shall provide a complete proof .",
    "the last part of the theorem can be easily checked by direct multiplication .",
    "we begin by proving that @xmath163 and @xmath164 generate @xmath1 .",
    "then , since @xmath165 , @xmath144 is also a set of generators .",
    "the matrices @xmath166 and @xmath163 are a set of generators of @xmath1 .",
    "the proof consists of showing that by successive multiplications from the right by @xmath167 and @xmath168 an arbitrary matrix @xmath169 can be reduced to either @xmath170 or @xmath168 .",
    "let us consider first the two cases when @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "firstly , suppose that @xmath171 , i.e. @xmath173 but @xmath174 . if @xmath175 then by applying @xmath176 we obtain @xmath177 . clearly , @xmath16 can be reduced to @xmath170 by repeated multiplications from the right by @xmath178 .",
    "if , instead , @xmath179 , repeated applications of @xmath170 will reduce @xmath16 either to @xmath168 or to a matrix of the form @xmath180 by multiplying   from the right by @xmath168 , the resulting matrix will have @xmath51 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath181 .",
    "if @xmath182 , we multiply @xmath16 from the right by @xmath168 , so that @xmath183 ; next we apply appropriately @xmath170 until @xmath184 ; we then apply @xmath168 and repeatedly multiply @xmath16 by @xmath170 until @xmath182 , and so on . since the elements of @xmath16 are integers , this procedure will stop after a finite number of steps when @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath16 is of the form  .",
    "the relations   can be verified straightforwardly by matrix multiplication . to complete the proof of theorem  [ th2 ] we only have to check that no other relations independent of   exist , i.e. if @xmath185 , where either @xmath186 or @xmath187 , then @xmath188 can be mapped into the void word by repeated applications of  .",
    "let us consider the quotient group @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the centre of @xmath1 and the kernel of the homomorphism @xmath191 .",
    "let us denote @xmath192 clearly @xmath193 and @xmath194 generate @xmath195 and @xmath196 maps the relations   into @xmath197 .",
    "we now proceed in two steps : firstly , we prove that @xmath198 secondly , using  , we show that   are the only relations in @xmath1 .",
    "let us introduce the groups @xmath199 it turns out ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) that @xmath200 is a free normal subgroup of @xmath195 of index two generated by @xmath201 furthermore",
    ", we have @xmath202 because of  , proving   is equivalent to showing that @xmath203 now , we have @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , by   each word @xmath205 of the symbols @xmath206 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , @xmath151 , can be mapped by a certain set of relations in @xmath195 into a string @xmath209 where either @xmath210 is a sequence of the symbols @xmath207 and @xmath208 or a word where @xmath211 and @xmath212 is a string that does not contain @xmath213 .",
    "since @xmath200 is a free group , there are no relations between @xmath194 and @xmath214 , therefore   and   are a consequence of the following .",
    "the map @xmath215 is achieved by the relations @xmath216    using @xmath217 any word @xmath188 can be transformed into a string where @xmath193 appears only with exponent one .",
    "next , using both relations  , all the sequences of the form @xmath218 can be turned into powers of @xmath194 and @xmath214 .",
    "suppose now that only an even number of @xmath193s are left into @xmath188 .",
    "then , we break @xmath188 into strings of the form @xmath219 such sequences can be transformed into powers of @xmath194 and @xmath214 by inserting @xmath220 between each pair @xmath221 .",
    "the resulting word @xmath210 does not contain @xmath193 . instead ,",
    "if @xmath188 contains an odd number of @xmath193s , the transformation   will leave only one @xmath193 in @xmath188 .",
    "now , either @xmath193 is the first symbol , in which case we stop , or @xmath188 begins with a string of the type @xmath222 the symbol @xmath193 can then be moved in the first position by multiplying the word by @xmath220 from the left and by inserting @xmath220 between each pair @xmath223 .",
    "we now have left to show that no other relations except   exist among @xmath163 , @xmath116 and @xmath164 .",
    "since @xmath116 commutes with both @xmath163 and @xmath164 , the only other possible relations must be of the form @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are strings that contain both @xmath163 and @xmath164 but not @xmath116 .",
    "now , @xmath164 is of infinite order ; this excludes relation   because , together with @xmath227 , it would imply that @xmath166 is of finite order",
    ". relations of the type   and   are excluded because their images under the homomorphism @xmath228 would be relations in @xmath195 involving @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem  [ th2 ] .",
    "theorem  [ th2 ] says that there exists a choice of phases in the definition of the propagators such that @xmath229 the quantum map @xmath5 for arbitrary @xmath169 is then given as a product of a certain finite sequence of @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "our goal is to prove that the propagators  ( 2.3 ) are equivalent to such a product",

    "our strategy will be to prove that multiplicativity holds if any of the propagators ( 2.3 ) is multiplied either from the right or from the left by any of @xmath232 or @xmath231 .",
    "this will imply the equivalence of definitions ( 2.3 ) and  , and will provide an independent proof of  .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to check that if we multiply any of the operators , , and from the left and from the right by @xmath233 and @xmath231 , then multiplicativity holds .",
    "thus , it remains to be proved for the subset of @xmath1 such that @xmath5 is of the form  , i.e. @xmath234 the product of @xmath235 with one of the generators of @xmath1 may not belong to @xmath125 .",
    "however , it turns out that we need to check multiplicativity only if the product of @xmath16 with a given generator still belongs to @xmath125 . for example , let us suppose that @xmath236 .",
    "then we have @xmath237 which implies @xmath238    moreover , it turns out that if multiplicativity holds if @xmath16 is multiplied from the right by the generators of @xmath1 , then it also true when @xmath16 is multiplied from the left and vice versa . for example , let us consider @xmath239 .",
    "since @xmath240 and @xmath241 , which can be verified directly from definitions ( 2.3 ) , we obtain @xmath242 which implies @xmath243 an analogous argument applies to @xmath167 .    proving multiplicativity for @xmath167 is quite straightforward .",
