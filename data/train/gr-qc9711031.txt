    "riemannian geometry provides the mathematical framework for general relativity and other modern theories of gravity .",
    "one therefore expects that a non - perturbative formulation of quantum gravity would require a corresponding quantum theory of geometry , and , at the same time , provide pointers for constructing this theory .",
    "familiar riemannian geometry would then emerge only as an approximation on coarse graining of the semi - classical states . in a specific non - perturbative approach based on canonical quantization ,",
    "these expectations are being borne out in detail .",
    "the goal of this series of papers is to present the resulting quantum theory of geometry .",
    "basic techniques were developed in @xcite and applied to the problem of constructing area operators .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to carry out a similar construction of volume operators .",
    "( the volume operator we derive in the main text was introduced in @xcite . )",
    "let us begin with a brief summary . in the canonical quantization approach used here ,",
    "the configuration variable is an @xmath0 connection @xmath1 on a three - manifold @xmath2 .",
    "( indices @xmath3 refer to the tangent space of @xmath2 and indices @xmath4 are the @xmath5 lie - algebra indices . )",
    "the momentum variable is a vector density @xmath6 with values in the @xmath5 lie algebra ( or , equivalently , a ( pseudo ) two - form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the levi - civita pseudo density ) . in the quantum theory , then , one is naturally led to consider the space @xmath9 of ( suitably generalized ) connections on @xmath2 as the ( quantum ) configuration space . to obtain the hilbert space @xmath10 of quantum states and geometric operators thereon",
    ", one needs a functional calculus on @xmath9 which also does not refer to a fiducial metric ( or any other background field ) .",
    "the necessary tools were developed in a series of papers by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "( much of the motivation for this work came from the ` loop representation ' introduced earlier by rovelli and smolin @xcite . )",
    "it turns out that @xmath9 admits a natural diffeomorphism invariant measure @xmath11 and the hilbert space @xmath10 can be taken to be the space @xmath12 of square - integrable functions on @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "physically , @xmath10 represents the space of kinematic quantum states , i.e. , the quantum analog of the full phase space .",
    "using the well - developed differential geometry on @xmath9 @xcite , one can then define physically interesting operators on @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , one can introduce , in a systematic manner , operator - valued distributions @xmath13 corresponding to the triads @xcite . as in classical riemannian geometry , these are the basic objects in the quantum case . specifically , the idea is to construct geometric operators e.g .",
    ", those corresponding to area , volume and length by regularizing the appropriate products of these triad operators .",
    "as remarked above , triads being density weighted can be naturally thought of as pseudo two - forms @xmath14 . to obtain phase space functions",
    ", it is natural to smear them against lie - algebra - valued test fields @xmath15 with support on _ two - dimensional surfaces_. can the corresponding quantum operators be well - behaved ?",
    "the answer is not apriori obvious : from minkowskian quantum field theory , one would expect that well - defined operators will not result unless they are smeared in ( at least ) three dimensions .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , however , for triads the answer is in the affirmative . more generally , in this approach to quantum geometry , there is a remarkable synergy between geometry and analysis : in the regularization procedure , well - defined operators result when n - forms are integrated on n - manifolds .",
    "thus , the operators that code information in connections are holonomies @xmath16 $ ] , obtained by integrating the connection one - forms along one - dimensional curves .",
    "the two - forms triad operators are naturally regulated through a two - dimensional smearing .",
    "this feature is deeply intertwined with the underlying diffeomorphism invariance of the theory . by contrast , in the quantum theory of maxwell fields in minkowski space - time , for example , one smears both connection one - forms and electric field two - forms in three dimensions , using the geometrical structures made available by the background metric .    in @xcite ,",
    "square - roots of appropriate products of the triad operators were regularized to obtain area operators @xmath17 associated with two - dimensional surfaces @xmath18 without boundary .",
    "these are the quantum analogs of the area functions @xmath19 defined on the classical phase space .",
    "we now wish to discuss the volume operator @xmath20 associated with a three - dimensional region @xmath21 the quantum analog of the function @xmath22 on the classical phase space . since @xmath23 is a rather complicated , non - polynomial function of the triads , as one might imagine , the issue of regularization is quite subtle .",
    "indeed , the problem turns out to be considerably more complicated than that for area operators .",
    "in particular ( for the continuum theory ) it appears that , so far , no regularization scheme has appeared in the literature which has the following rather basic property : if we denote by @xmath24 the regulated version of the volume operator , then ( in the hilbert space topology ) the limit @xmath25 should exist for a dense subset of states @xmath26 .",
    "we will rectify this situation .",
    "in the process , we will also spell out the underlying assumptions and point out some other subtleties that are often overlooked .",
    "finally , in our treatment , the limit is achieved at a finite stage , i.e. , for all @xmath27 .",
    "this property makes our regularization of volume operators consistent with that of the hamiltonian constraint ; there is thus a uniform scheme that is applicable for all operators of physical interest . in the main body of the paper",
    ", we will discuss a regularization along the lines that led us to area operators in @xcite .",
    "( the final form of this volume operator was reported in @xcite and its restriction to a lattice theory was discussed by loll @xcite .",
    "the operator was also studied by thiemann in @xcite . )",
    "we will see that this operator is sensitive to the differential structure on the three - manifold @xmath2 .",
    "in the appendix , we will consider a different regularization scheme which is based on a construction given by rovelli and smolin @xcite in the loop representation .",
    "( the final closed - form expression of that operator was introduced by de pietri and rovelli in @xcite , and , in the framework discussed here , in @xcite . ) in a certain sense , this operator is not sensitive to the differential structure of @xmath2 .",
    "we will see that both operators can be constructed through systematic regularizations .",
    "they are well - defined , self - adjoint operators on @xmath10 with purely discrete spectrum .",
    "the actual expressions of the two operators are rather similar and the difference between them can be interpreted simply as a ` quantization ambiguity ' .",
    "nonetheless , in various applications , e.g. , to quantum dynamics @xcite , they can lead to important differences . to get a deeper understanding of the relation between them",
    ", one needs to further analyze their properties e.g .",
    ", their relation to the area and length @xcite operators .",
    "such a systematic analysis has begun only recently .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] is devoted to preliminaries .",
    "regularization leading to the first operator is discussed in detail in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] and , using techniques introduced by de pietri , the regularization leading to the rovelli - smolin operator is discussed in the appendix .",
    "some properties of the volume operator are discussed in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "section [ sec6 ] summarizes the main results and compares the regularization procedures .    for simplicity , in the main discussion ,",
    "we have set @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 and chosen the real connection @xmath31 to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spin connection compatible with the triad @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the extrinsic curvature . as pointed out by immirzi @xcite using earlier work of barbero @xcite , unitarily inequivalent quantum theories result if one begins with the canonical pair @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a non - zero real parameter .",
    "thus , in the main discussion , we will work with the @xmath39 sector . in section [ sec4.4 ] ,",
    "we will restore @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 and also state the main result in any immirzi sector .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the mathematical ideas that underlie the present approach to quantum riemannian geometry . this discussion will also serve to fix notation .",

    "our configuration space @xmath44 will consist of smooth connections on @xmath43 .",
    "since all @xmath0 bundles over three - manifolds are trivial , we can fix a trivialization and regard each connection @xmath45 on @xmath43 as an @xmath5-valued one - form @xmath31 on @xmath2 , where @xmath46 is the form index , and @xmath47 , the lie - algebra index .",
    "( we will not specify boundary conditions on fields because they are irrelevant for the issues we wish to discuss here . )",

    "like all other steps in the regularization procedure , averaging is of course unnecessary in the classical theory .",

    "note however that such subtleties are a common - place in quantum field theory .",
    "for example , in interacting scalar field theories in low dimensions one generally has to remove the regulators in a specific order and/or take limits keeping certain ratios of cut - offs and parameters of the theory constant . similarly , in gauge theories based on lattices , to compute expectation values of wilson loops in the continuum limit , one only allows rectangular lattices and the refinement of these lattices is often tailored to the wilson loop in question .",

    "fix a graph @xmath67 and focus on @xmath163 .",
    "the allowed refinements of the partition of the region @xmath21 will depend on the graph @xmath67 .",
    "more precisely , we will assume that ( for sufficiently small @xmath129 ) the permissible partitions @xmath123 satisfy the following three conditions ( see fig.2 ) :    * every vertex of the graph @xmath67 ( within @xmath21 ) is contained in the _ interior _ of one of the cells , say @xmath117 , and coincides with the intersection point of the triplet of two - surfaces @xmath167 assigned to @xmath117 by the partition @xmath123 ; * if a cell @xmath117 _ does _ contain a vertex , say @xmath109 , then @xmath109 is the unique isolated intersection point between the union of the three two - surfaces @xmath168 associated to @xmath117 and the range of @xmath67 ; and , * if a cell @xmath117 _ does not _",

    "however , this restriction is imposed only for simplicity of presentation . because of the averaging procedure of section [ sec4 ] , contributions from such non - generic partitions to the final result are negligible .",

    "furthermore , once a refinement satisfying these two conditions is achieved , subsequent refinements needed in the limiting procedure automatically satisfy them .",
    "nonetheless , these conditions do restrict the allowed partitions . as we will see , they ensure that the limiting operator is well - defined ; if refinements are taken arbitrarily , in general the limit fails to exist .",
    "let us now suppose that the partition @xmath123 satisfies these conditions and evaluate the action of the operator @xmath155 on an element @xmath164 in @xmath163 .",

    "the possible ` components ' of these vectors are @xmath173 and depend only on the octants defined by the two - surfaces @xmath174 which contains the edge @xmath71 .",

    "let us now focus on the non - trivial case in which @xmath117 contains a vertex @xmath109 .",
    "the action of the operator @xmath135 depends on the three two - surfaces @xmath168 _ only _ through the properties of these surfaces at @xmath109 .",

    "now , if given the space @xmath163 we used in the above construction a different graph @xmath92 whose range is the same as that of @xmath67 , the only difference is that @xmath92 may have some extra bi - valent vertices and/or some bi - valent vertices of @xmath67 may be missing in the set of vertices of @xmath92 .",
    "however , for a bi - valent vertex , the operator @xmath135 vanishes identically .",

    "hence , although the limit of the operator @xmath154 of ( [ hv1 ] ) is well - defined , it does not lead to a viable candidate for the volume operator .",

    "in particular therefore , if a graph has only bi - valent has ( at most ) tri - valent vertices , simple algebra shows that the action of the limiting operator on all _ gauge invariant _ states in @xmath166 also vanishes @xcite .",

    "vertices , the limit of the regularized operator @xmath135 annihilates all states in @xmath166 .",
    "we will see that these properties are trivially preserved by averaging and are therefore shared by the final volume operator @xmath20 we will obtain in the next section .",
    "to remove the background dependence , we need to appropriately average @xmath135 over the relevant background structures , use the resulting operator @xmath178 in place of @xmath135 in ( [ hv1],[hq1 ] ) , and then take the limit .",
    "our discussion is divided in to four parts . in the first",
    ", we spell out the basic strategy . in the second ,",
    "we show that the desired symmetries of the final volume operator and the consistency requirement on the regularization procedure fix the form of the averaged quantity @xmath179,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] and hence also of the final volume operator uniquely up to a multiplicative constant . in the third ,",
    "we establish the existence of certain measures that are needed for the averaging procedure . finally ,",
    "in the forth part , we collect results of the sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4.1 ] - [ sec4.3 ] to arrive at the desired volume operator .",
    "the background dependence in the limit of the regularized volume operator ( [ hv1],[hq42 ] ) appears only through the factors @xmath175,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] associated with cells containing a vertex of @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , let us first focus only on a single cell @xmath117 containing a vertex @xmath109 .",
    "note that @xmath175,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] depends only on the relation between the three edges and the coordinate octants _ at _ the vertex @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , while there is an infinite - dimensional freedom in the choice of the background coordinates with which we began , the ` relevant ' freedom for averaging turns out to be only finite dimensional . to see this ,",
    "let us regard two coordinate systems in @xmath117 , centered at @xmath109 , as equivalent if they yield the same @xmath175,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] for all triplets of edges of @xmath67 passing through @xmath109 .",
    "then , given two equivalence classes and a coordinate system belonging to the first , one can generically find a system in the second which is related to the first by the action of @xmath180 , the group of orientation - preserving general linear transformations at @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , the diagonal subgroup @xmath181 of @xmath180 merely re - scales the coordinates and hence leaves each @xmath172 $ ] unchanged .",
    "hence , to get rid of the background dependence , it suffices to average @xmath175,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] only on the _ finite _ dimensional coset - space @xmath182 .",
    "topologically , this space @xmath136 of ` relevant ' background structures can be identified with an open subset of @xmath183 and coordinatized by six angular coordinates , @xmath138 say , with @xmath184 .    our task is to average the operator @xmath135 over the space @xmath136 in such a way that the resulting volume operator @xmath20 is well - defined and covariant , i.e.",

    ", we can again construct a permissible partition @xmath188 of @xmath21 .",
    "denote by @xmath189 the cell in this partition containing the vertex @xmath109 .",
    "replacing @xmath117 by @xmath189 in section [ sec3.3 ] , for each @xmath190 , we obtain an operator @xmath191 on @xmath192 .",
    "we wish to average these operators with respect to a suitable probability measure on @xmath136 .",
    "now , given _ any _ normalized function @xmath144 , ( i.e. satisfying @xmath193 ) the average @xmath194 of @xmath195 is given by : [ 4.1 ] _",

    "thus , for any normalized measure @xmath196 , the averaged operators @xmath197 are well - defined . using these in place of @xmath135 in ( [ hv1 ] )",

    "it is straightforward to remove the regulator .",
    "so far , for simplicity of presentation , we have focussed on a single cell @xmath117 containing a vertex @xmath109 .",
    "however , since the coordinate systems @xmath187 were not adapted to any specific cell , ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ det3 ] ) hold for all cells .    to summarize ,",
    "the basic idea is simply to repeat the procedure of section [ sec3 ] but now using _ averaged _ operators .",
    "physical justification for this strategy comes from the fact that , as we saw in section [ sec3.1 ] , the averaging procedure does yield the correct volume functional in the classical theory .",
    "the key question then is : what measure should we use for averaging ? unfortunately , the space @xmath136 is non - compact and does not admit a canonical normalized measure .",
    "can a suitable measure be perhaps selected by examining the classical limit ? the answer is in the negative : as we saw in section [ sec3.1 ] , although the averaging procedure _ is _ applicable classically , the averaged regulated volume tends to @xmath23 for _ any _ normalized @xmath144 . in the quantum theory , on the other hand , this is not the case and we need to find @xmath144 for which the final volume operator is background independent . in section [ sec4.2 ]",
    "we will assume that such measures exist and show that the requirement of covariance of the final volume operator determines @xmath199 and hence also the final volume operator uniquely up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "existence of measures of the required type will then be established in section [ sec4.3 ] .",
    "let us suppose that there does exist a normalized measure @xmath196 on @xmath136 such that the resulting volume operator @xmath20 transforms covariantly under diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "what can we say about the corresponding @xmath200,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] ?",
    "the purpose of this sub - section is to show that , given any cell containing a vertex @xmath109 of any graph , the quantity must be of the type : [ kappa2 ] ^([e_i],[e_j],[e_k ] ) = _ ( ) ( e_i , e_j , e_k ) for some ( measure - dependent ) constant @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the orientation function which equals @xmath203 if the tangent directions$ ] at a point @xmath81 in @xmath2 defines unique oriented tangent direction at @xmath81 . ] to the three edges are linearly dependent at the vertex @xmath109 , and @xmath204 if they are linearly independent and oriented positively or negatively .",
    "( recall that @xmath2 is oriented . )",
    "thus , the measure dependence is contained in a single , overall multiplicative constant .",
    "the idea is to use symmetries of @xmath200,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] implied by ( [ det2 ] ) , ( [ det3 ] ) and the requirement that @xmath20 be diffeomorphism covariant , to constrain its form .",
    "we saw at the end of the last sub - section that @xmath205,[e_j ] , [ e_k])$ ] has two properties irrespective of the choice of a permissible partition .",
    "it is trivial to verify that these properties are preserved by averaging .",
    "thus , we have :    * @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] depends _ only _ on the germs of the edges ; and , * @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] is totally anti - symmetric in its three arguments .",
    "next , recall that a cylindrical function in @xmath166 is also cylindrical with respect to a graph @xmath92 with @xmath207 , i.e. , such that ( the range of ) @xmath67 is contained in ( the range of ) @xmath92 .",
    "since we want the volume operator @xmath20 to be well - defined at the end , its action on a state should not depend on whether we regard the state as being cylindrical with respect to the first graph or the second .",
    "this implies that    * the function @xmath208,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] defined by @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] depends only on the germs of the three edges and _ not _ on the specific graph used in the computation .",
    "thus , the averaging procedure simply provides a function from germs of ( ordered ) triplets of edges intersecting at any point @xmath81 in @xmath2 to reals .",
    "next , the assumed diffeomorphism covariance of the volume operator implies that this function must have the following property :    * given any two triplets @xmath209 and @xmath210 of edges related by an orientation preserving diffeomorphism of @xmath2 , ^([e_i],[e_j],[e_k ] ) = ^([e_i],[e_j],[e_k ] ) .",
    "the next property follows immediately from ( 2)-(4 ) .",
    "* let the triplet be such that the tangent directions they define at @xmath81 are linearly independent . then , [ det4 ] ^([e_i],[e_j],[e_k ] ) = _ ( ) ( e_i , e_j , e_k ) since this is the only diffeomorphism invariant , totally anti - symmetric function of germs of ordered triplets of edges intersecting at @xmath81 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the three tangent directions are linearly dependent , other invariants exist , which depend on higher derivatives of edges at the intersection point .",
    "apriori , these are potential candidates for @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] .",
    "however , they can be ruled out as follows .",
    "consider two triplets with same orientation , @xmath211 , [ e_2 ] , [ e_3])$ ] and @xmath211 , [ e_2 ] , [ e'_3])$ ] such that @xmath212 is tangent to @xmath213 at @xmath81 .",
    "for a point @xmath214 such that none of the corresponding two - surfaces @xmath168 passing through @xmath109 is tangent to any of the germs @xmath215 , the germs @xmath213 and @xmath212 are on the same side of each of the two - surfaces .",
    "therefore , almost everywhere on @xmath136 , we have @xmath216 .",
    "hence , whenever the three pairs of primed and unprimed germs define the same oriented tangent directions at @xmath81 , the equality  ( [ e_i ] , [ e_j ] , [ e_k ] , ) = ( [ e_i ] , [ e_j ] , [ e_k ] , ) holds almost everywhere on @xmath136 . in this case , integration with respect to a @xmath217 yields ^([e_i],[e_j],[e_k ] ) = ^([e_i],[e_j ] , [ e_k ] ) . to summarize",
    ", we have shown that    * given a point @xmath81 in @xmath2 , @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] can depend _ only _ on the oriented tangent directions at @xmath81 defined by the three germs .",
    "we can now use this property to evaluate @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] in the case when the tangent directions are linearly dependent .",
    "if two of these directions coincide , anti - symmetry immediately implies that @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] must vanish .",
    "next , note that ( [ kappa1 ] ) implies that @xmath218 = -\\k_{s_a}[-e_i]$ ] .",

    "then , modulo a possible diffeomorphism ( to ` straighten out the edges ' ) , there is a coordinate system in @xmath136 in which ( the point @xmath81 lies at the origin and ) the three germs coincide with straight lines @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "finally , there exists an orientation preserving diffeomorphism the rotation through @xmath221 along the third axis which carries @xmath211 , [ e_2 ] , [ e_3])$ ] to @xmath222 , [ e_1 ] , [ e_3])$ ] .",
    "hence , by diffeomorphism invariance and anti - symmetry , we conclude @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k ] ) = 0 $ ] in this case as well .",
    "thus , we have :    * if the three tangent directions determined by the edges @xmath223,[e_j],[e_k])$ ] at @xmath81 are linearly dependent , then @xmath206,[e_j],[e_k ] ) = 0 $ ] .",

    "in the main body of the paper we presented a regularization scheme to obtain volume operators @xmath20 associated with open regions @xmath21 of the ` spatial ' 3-manifolds @xmath2 and discussed a few properties of these operators .",
    "as in any ` quantization ' , the idea is to first express the classical observable of interest ( in our case , functions @xmath23 on the classical phase space ) in terms of ` elementary ' variables ( in our case , two - dimensionally smeared triads ) which have unambiguous quantum analogs , then promote this ` regulated ' classical expression to quantum theory and finally remove the regulators .",
    "there is considerable freedom in the first step and we chose an ` internal ' regularization in which the volume of an elementary cell is expressed in terms of triads smeared over three two - surfaces passing through the _ interior _ of the cell .",
    "it was relatively straightforward to carry over the classical expression to the quantum theory and remove the regulators .",
    "however , it turned out that the the resulting operator carries a memory of the background structures used in the regularization procedure and fails to transform covariantly under diffeomorphisms of @xmath2 .",
    "to rectify this situation , we first averaged the regulated expressions over the ` relevant ' background structures and then removed the regulators . the resulting operator @xmath224 is uniquely defined up to an overall ( @xmath21-independent ) constant @xmath228 .",

    "its spectrum is purely discrete .    the central part of the paper is contained in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] which discuss the intricacies of the regularization procedure .",
    "the overall philosophy here is the same as that used in other quantum field theories and the subtleties involved in the continuum limit are of the same nature as those encountered there . in our case , a key simplification occurs because ( a large class of ) operators on the kinematical hilbert space @xmath10 can be naturally considered as a consistent family of operators on partial hilbert spaces @xmath291 associated with graphs @xmath67 @xcite .. in the present case , in particular , we could focus on the restrictions @xmath165 of the desired operator @xmath20 to @xmath291 . in the regularization procedure , therefore , we could refer to the graph @xmath67 .",
    "the key test of the procedure comes from consistency requirement : the operators @xmath165 so regulated could have failed to be consistent .",

    "the regularization procedure could , however , be improved in some respects .",
    "first , the regulated expressions ( [ q ] , [ apprvol ] ) are not gauge invariant . however",
    ", a cosmetic change can rectify this situation without affecting our arguments or the final result : it suffices to replace the simple integration of @xmath132 in ( [ q ] ) over a two - surface with integration combined with the parallel transport along some fixed paths ending at fixed point .",
    "this additional step does not affect the result which is already gauge invariant .",
    "it would be more difficult to make the regularization procedure manifestly diffeomorphism covariant",
    ". however , this is largely an aesthetic issue since our final result does enjoy diffeomorphism covariance .",
    "next , at least at first sight , the ambiguity of a multiplicative constant @xmath228 appears to be an undesirable feature .",
    "recall however from section [ sec4.4 ] that there is another ambiguity at the kinematical level , first pointed out by immirzi @xcite using earlier work of barbero @xcite .",
    "this arises from the existence of a canonical transformation which fails to be unitarily implementable and leads to a one parameter family of unitarily inequivalent representations of the holonomy - triad operators . for volume operators ,",
    "the net effect is that there is an ambiguity of a multiplicative constant in the spectrum which can not be eliminated without additional input .",
    "therefore , from a ` practical ' viewpoint , the freedom in the choice of @xmath228 does not worsen the situation .",
    "the appendix discusses another regularization scheme , based on constructions given by rovelli , smolin and de pietri @xcite in the loop representation .",
    "this may be called an ` external ' regularization because the starting point is an expression of the volume of an elementary cell in terms of triads smeared on the _ boundary _ of the cell . in the early discussions",
    ", it was believed that this regularization is free of the subtleties we encountered in section [ sec3.2 ] while taking the continuum limit in the quantum theory .",
    "however , a careful treatment of the limit shows that this is not the case ; the assumptions needed to ensure that a well - defined limit exists are completely analogous to those introduced in section [ sec3.2 ] .",
    "the final result does differ from that presented in the main body of the paper .",
    "because of the ` external ' regularization , these regulated and hence also the final operators do not have any information about the details of the tangent vectors to the edges at vertices .",
    "hence they transform covariantly not only under diffeomorphisms but also homeomorphisms on @xmath2 in the sense spelled out in section [ sec5.3 ] .",
    "however , in simple situations such as those considered in simplicial treatments @xcite , the two operators coincide ( apart from a constant @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "although it is often not explicitly stated , the ambiguity of an overall constant exists also in the ` external ' regularization . there , it is buried in the in one s choice of ` rectangular ' cells .",
    "if one changes to tetrahedral cells , for example , the overall constant in front of that volume operator would change .",
    "indeed , the situation is parallel to that in the ` internal ' approach of the main text .",
    "there , the @xmath228-ambiguity arose because , while the limit of the classical , averaged expression is insensitive to the choice of the measure used in the averaging , the limit of the quantum operator is unique only up to an overall constant .",
    "similarly , in the ` external ' approach , while the limit of the classical , regulated expression is insensitive to the details of the geometry of elementary cells , the corresponding quantum volume operators can differ by an overall constant .    to conclude , we wish to emphasize that the existence of two distinct operators is a reflection only of quantization ambiguities . in both approaches",
    ", one begins by re - expressing the classical volume function @xmath23 in terms of two - dimensionally smeared triads and takes these ` regulated ' classical expressions over to quantum theory .",

    "these subtleties , discussed in subsections [ seca.3 ] and [ seca.4 ] below , were overlooked in @xcite .",
    "finally , as is the case for the ` internal ' regularization discussed in the main text , our ` external ' regularization is consistent with the treatment of the hamiltonian constraint in the literature @xcite .",
    "let us discuss this point in some detail .",
    "recall first that the domain of this constraint operator is the diffeomorphism invariant subspace of the algebraic dual to the hilbert space @xmath10 @xcite , or an appropriate extension thereof @xcite .",
    "the topology one uses to take the limit while removing the regulator is defined as follows .",
    "if @xmath330 denotes the regulated operator on @xmath10 ( where @xmath331 symbolizes the regulator ) and @xmath332 a dual state , then the limit @xmath333 as @xmath334 is defined via its action @xmath335 on @xmath332 by the following formula [ top ] s| : = _ 0 s| ^for every @xmath26 in the domain of @xmath336 . in the case of the volume operator now under consideration , it appears that the topology used implicitly in @xcite is inequivalent to ( [ top ] ) .",
    "( see @xcite for the discussion of that topology . ) indeed , if in the derivation presented in @xcite , or in the one proposed in @xcite , we take the final limits using the topology corresponding to ( [ top ] ) , the final result would be different from that given in @xcite ( see footnote 13 ) . in our treatment , as in the main text , we will remove the regulator using the hilbert space topology and obtain a densely defined operator @xmath20 on @xmath10 .",
    "the dual action of this operator on the dual space coincides with the action defined by ( [ top ] ) . thus , while our final answer is equivalent to that of @xcite , our regularization provides a general procedure which is ` uniformly ' applicable to the volume operator as well as the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "not only is this aesthetically pleasing but quite essential if , for example , one wishes to incorporate the cosmological constant in the hamiltonian constraint .    as before , one begins with a partition @xmath44 of the open region @xmath21 in to cells and but associates to each cell @xmath117 extra paths to parallel transport the triads @xmath132 to a fixed point .",
    "let us choose an arbitrary partition @xmath44 of @xmath21 into cells .",

    "what may be easily overlooked is that one can not get rid of cells of type _ ( iib ) _ so simply ; these contributions can be coordinate dependent and may even diverge . to see this ,",
    "suppose we just use the partition @xmath371 given by a cubic lattice of the size @xmath372 defined by the fixed coordinates system on @xmath21 .",

    "the other cell @xmath117 which shares that face is crossed by the edges @xmath318 and @xmath253 .",
    "this produces a non - zero term @xmath374 .",
    "one may , of course , choose another coordinate system such that @xmath318 and @xmath253 intersect disjoint faces of @xmath375 and do not cross the same adjacent cell .",
    "but this simply serves to bring out the ambiguity caused by the _ coordinates dependence_. shrinking of @xmath347 does not eliminate that ambiguity which is sensitive to rotations of a given @xmath373 rather than to its size .    for similar reasons , the limiting procedure produces divergences when @xmath318 and @xmath253 are tangent to each other at @xmath109 . in this case , generically , as one shrinks the maximal size of cells , the number of cells crossed simultaneously by @xmath318 and @xmath253 tends to _ infinity_. one can check that the consequence is that the norm @xmath376 diverges in the limit .    to summarize , _ to ensure convergence , as in section _",
    "[ sec3 ] , _ one has to put restrictions on how the limit is taken using the graph @xmath67 . _",
    "the choice we will make which seems to be the only natural one available is to restrict ourselves to partitions containing cells only of the types @xmath377 and @xmath378 .",
    "this restriction is very similar to that used in section [ sec3 ] .      for a partition",
    "@xmath347 satisfying the above restriction , the regulated volume operator is given by [ volada ] _",

    "note however that diffeomorphism invariant dual states @xmath332 in ( [ top ] ) are not sensitive to the shrinking of paths , so they never disappear as far as the action of such states is concerned .",
    "this means that if one wishes to use the same topology ( [ top ] ) as in the definition of the hamiltonian constraint operator , the final limit would be different from the one reported in @xcite .",

    "orthogonal to @xmath381 corresponding to any vertex @xmath382 of @xmath67 .",
    "so the problem of convergence reduces to the convergence of each @xmath380 as we shrink @xmath373 to @xmath109 separately for every vertex @xmath109 .",
    "but if we shrink @xmath373 to a cell @xmath375 containing @xmath109 then for a generic paths assignment , the norm @xmath383 is non - zero , _ independently _ of @xmath375 .",
    "the main reason is that @xmath384 has a non - zero component on a graph @xmath385 obtained from @xmath67 by introducing new vertices made at the intersection points @xmath361 with @xmath340 and adding new edges , the paths @xmath386 .",
    "the graph @xmath387 corresponding to @xmath388 is ( generically ) different then @xmath385 .",
    "moreover , the projection of @xmath388 on the space corresponding to @xmath387 is , generically , diffeomorphism equivalent to the projection of @xmath389 on the space corresponding to @xmath390 . hence shrinking",
    "does not affect the norm of the projection .",
    "all this makes the sequence of vectors @xmath391 highly non - convergent as @xmath347 is refined .",
    "these problems obviously disappear if , given a graph @xmath67 , we choose a paths assignment such that for the above graphs we have [ grpr ] _ 1  =  _1  =  . for every cell .",
    "such an assignment does exist and was pointed out to us by de pietri @xcite .",
    "it is defined as follows .",
    "denote the edges of @xmath67 that meet at @xmath109 by @xmath71 , @xmath392 , and orient them to be outgoing .",
    "denote by @xmath393 the segment of @xmath71 contained inside @xmath373 and by @xmath394 the remaining segment of @xmath71 .",
    "to each intersection point @xmath395 set @xmath396 and to a point @xmath397 which is not intersected by an edge , assign any path @xmath398 ( such that the previous regularity assumption ( [ pr ] ) is satisfied ) .",
    "with these restrictions on the partition @xmath347 , the regulator can be removed unambiguously .",
    "we will evaluate the limit in the next two sub - sections .",
    "for the present , we will just comment on the similarity between the restrictions on partitions used in the two regularization schemes : given a cell containing a vertex @xmath109 , making all the paths begin right at @xmath109 is the ` external ' regularization counter part of the ` internal ' regularization assumption that the 2-surfaces @xmath168 in @xmath117 intersect exactly at @xmath109 .    to conclude this discussion let us note that the issue of path assignments did not arise in the ` internal ' regularization because we worked not on the space @xmath399 of generalized connections modulo gauge transformations but on the space @xmath9 of generalized connections themselves . the loop representation used in @xcite , on the other hand , deals only with @xmath399 and the extra paths become necessary to ensure gauge invariance of smeared triads . in the connection representation , there is a choice : we could have avoided the issue of path dependence entirely by carrying out the ` external ' regularization on @xmath9 .",
    "we did not do so to keep as close to the treatment of @xcite as possible .",
    "let us now return to ( [ |.| ] ) and investigate the operator @xmath400 .",
    "one can show that only the terms @xmath370 contribute to the sum which is relevant for the self adjointness of the entries of @xmath401 . to see this , note that , in terms of the segments @xmath402 of @xmath67 that meet at an intersection point @xmath403 , we have : j_w_i^i  =  12(j_e^+_i^i  -  j_e^-_i^i ) .",
    "in particular , restricted to @xmath358 , the operators associated with @xmath361 commute ,  =  0 .",
    "hence the term corresponding to @xmath404 ( _ i_ju_w_iw_k_ku_w_kw_i ) j_w_k^kj_w_i^jj_w_i^i   vanishes because the trace is antisymmetric in @xmath405 .",
    "let us now suppose that the partition @xmath347 satisfies the restrictions of the last two sub - sections .",
    "using de pietri s path assignment , denote the parallel transports along @xmath71 , @xmath393 and @xmath394 by @xmath406 , @xmath407 and @xmath408 respectively .",
    "the action of @xmath409 on a cylindrical function @xmath410 is given by j_w_i^i_(a )  =  ( u_i^+(a)_i u_i^-(a))^a_b^a_b . so that eq ( [ |.| ] ) now reads [",

    "therefore , ( _ , f(z_1 ) _ , f(z_2 ) _ , f(z_3 ) )  :   ^(3 ) _ ( )  ^(0 ) _ ( ) .",
    "that means that the right hand side of ( [ | .. | ] ) is in fact a function of the entire parallel transports @xmath412 so that one may make the substitution @xmath413 and @xmath414 to derive its general form .",
