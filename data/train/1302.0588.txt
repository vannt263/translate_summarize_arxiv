    "the jaynes - cummings model ( jcm ) @xcite is one of the simplest quantum systems describing the interaction of matter with electromagnetic radiation employing a hamiltonian of a two - level atom coupled to a single bosonic mode . due to its importance in laser physics and quantum optics",
    ", this model has been the subject of many recent investigations , both theoretical and experimental @xcite .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that the temporal behavior of this system is very sensitive to the statistical properties of the radiation field in the initial state , revealing pure quantum features which have no classical counterpart , such as vacuum rabi oscillations 3a , collapse and revival phenomena @xcite and squeezing of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "these predictions have been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "the jcm has been generalized in different ways . in some cases ,",
    "the interaction between the atom and the radiation field is no longer linear in the field variables , i.e. intensity dependent coupling has been considered @xcite .",
    "other investigations relate the jc hamiltonian to @xmath1 and @xmath2 superalgebras @xcite .",
    "most of the nonlinear generalizations of the jcm are made by using appropriate @xmath3-deformed oscillators @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the application of the corresponding quantum algebras has proved useful in obtaining exactly soluble models @xcite .",
    "additional generalizations of the jcm can be found in @xcite .",
    "nonlinear phenomena are ubiquitous in quantum optics",
    ". one of the simplest phenomenon is the kerr effect , which occurs when the refractive index of a medium varies with the number of excitations of the field .",
    "quantum descriptions of optical fields propagating in a kerr medium reveal a number of interesting features , such as photon antibunching , squeezing and the formation of schrdinger cats @xcite , which have no classical analogues .",
    "the kerr medium has been recently considered in the framework of @xmath4-deformed oscillators @xcite and the moyal phase space representation @xcite .",
    "some authors have considered a system where a two - level atom is surrounded by a kerr medium using a special case of @xmath3-deformed oscillators @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use an @xmath5 spin model , which exhibits the main properties of the kerr medium @xcite , to describe an intensity dependent coupling between a two - level atom and the radiation field in the framework of the jcm .",
    "the main feature of the model is that it is formulated on a finite dimensional hilbert space , so that the number of excitations of the field is bounded from above . in the limit",
    "when the dimension of the hilbert space becomes infinite , the @xmath6 algebra of the spin operators contracts to the heisenberg - weyl algebra of boson operators and the model coincides with the usual jcm .",
    "it is well known that the heisenberg - weyl algebra can be obtained by a contraction of the @xmath6 algebra @xcite . taking this limit as a motivation ,",
    "let us start by considering the @xmath6 commutation relations @xmath7=2\\hat{s}_{3},~\\ [ \\hat{s}_{3},\\hat{s}_{\\pm } ] = \\pm \\hat{s}_{\\pm } , ~\\ \\hat{s}_{\\pm } = \\hat{s}_{1}\\pm i\\hat{s}_{2}.\\]]in a given * *  * * unitary irreducible representation @xmath8 , we introduce the operators@xmath9which act on a @xmath10-dimensional hilbert space of a particle with spin @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 algebra in this representation is thus written as@xmath11=\\hat{b},~~\\ [ \\hat{b}^{\\dag } , \\hat{n}]=-\\hat{b}% ^{\\dag } , ~~\\ [ \\hat{b},\\hat{b}^{\\dag } ] = 1-\\frac{\\hat{n}}{j } ,   \\label{alg}\\]]which allows the interpretation of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) as creation ( annihilation ) operators for the quanta labeled by the number operator @xmath14**. * * the oscillator - like * *  * * hamiltonian , in terms of the spin * *  * * @xmath8 operators , is * *  * * @xmath15the analogy of this expression with the usual optical kerr hamiltonian is evident , but the main difference is that the spin number excitation is bounded from above : @xmath16 .",
    "this is a consequence of the angular momentum condition @xmath17 , once it is written in terms of the eigenvalues of the number operator @xmath18 .",
    "clearly the energy spectrum has the twofold degeneracy @xmath19 .",
    "note that although this hamiltonian can be easily obtained in the framework of @xmath3-deformed oscillators , we use an algebraic model which possesses a physical interpretation of quantum deformation based on the fundamental @xmath20 group .",
    "the standard harmonic oscillator limit is obtained when @xmath21 , in which case @xmath22 and @xmath23 turn out to be * *  * * the usual bosonic operators acting on an infinite dimensional hilbert space , i.e. , the nonlinearity and the maximum number of excitations disappear .",
    "we observe that the relation between the number operator and the corresponding creation - annihilation operators is * *  * * @xmath24 , \\]]which leads to the usual relation @xmath25 when @xmath21 .",
    "the solution of heisenberg s equation of motion for spin operators is @xmath26 ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\hat{s}_{2}(t ) & = & e^{i\\frac{\\omega t}{2j}}[\\sin ( \\hat{\\omega}t)\\hat{s}% _ { 1}+\\cos ( \\hat{\\omega}t)\\hat{s}_{2 } ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\hat{s}_{3}(t ) & = & \\hat{s}_{3},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the time evolution of @xmath28 is a rotation around the @xmath29 axis , but the precession frequency depends on the excitation number operator .",
    "this result is in complete analogy with that obtained in the case of the kerr medium @xcite .    in molecular physics ,",
    "this model correspond to a diatomic molecule approximated by a morse potential and the eigenstates correspond to the @xmath30 symmetry - adapted basis @xcite .",
    "it was shown that this type of hamiltonian describes the interaction of a collective atomic system with the off - resonant radiation field in a dispersive cavity @xcite .",
    "nonlinear coherent states ( ncss ) have been discussed in different approaches and arriving to different states @xcite .",
    "the most representative  ones are constructed * *  * * in the framework of @xmath3-deformed oscillators 26 , in which ncss are eigenstates of the @xmath3-annihilation operator .",
    "a generalization of the @xmath5 coherent states given by a multiphoton holstein - primakoff transformation is discussed in ref.@xcite , and their physical consequences are studied in the framework of the standard jc model . here",
    "we describe the @xmath5 coherent states corresponding to the single photon case in the su(2 ) spin model and use them to study the modified jc model to be defined in the next section .",
    "the group - theoretical coherent state ( see ref.@xcite ) for the unitary irreducible representation of the @xmath0 lie algebra corresponding to eq.([defop ] ) is:@xmath31where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the ladder operators @xmath35 select the vacuum state @xmath36 from the states @xmath37 as usual : @xmath38 .",
    "the natural phase space is the sphere of radius @xmath8 ; the spin coherent states are thus represented by spots on the sphere .",
    "this dynamics leads to schrdinger cat states on the sphere 18 , i.e. , a superposition of several spots located far  from each other . in the harmonic limit",
    ", the sphere opens to the phase plane and the model coincides with the quantum harmonic oscillator or , through a renormalization , with the usual kerr medium .    using the disentangling theorem for @xmath5 operators , we can rewrite eq.([defcohsu2 ] ) in the following form@xmath39where @xmath40 .",
    "then , the photon number distribution of the field prepared in the state @xmath41 is@xmath42and the mean photon number is@xmath43this result shows that @xmath44 is bounded from above .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ fotdist ] ) in the following form@xmath45which is a binomial distribution in @xmath46 with parameter @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "evidently @xmath48 converges towards the poisson distribution if @xmath44 remains fixed when @xmath49 .",
    "one of the most interesting features of the @xmath5 coherent states is that they exhibit squeezing which depends on @xmath50 .",
    "we start with a brief review of the standard formulation of the jcm . in the dipole and rotating wave approximation , the jc hamiltonian for a system of a single atom interacting with a single mode is given by @xcite@xmath51where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the well - known energy operators for the field and atom , respectively . here",
    "@xmath54 is the field mode frequency and @xmath55 is the atomic transition frequency .",
    "the coupling between the atom and the radiation field is described by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a coupling constant .",
    "besides @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the usual bosonic creation and annihilation operators for photons in the mode , which obey the heisenberg - weyl algebra . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the usual rising and lowering operators describing the fermionic two - level atom and @xmath62 is the atomic inversion operator , which follow the standard pseudo - spin algebra .",
    "now , let us introduce the spin model discussed in sec .",
    "ii into the jc hamiltonian to describe a two - level atom surrounded by a kerr medium .",
    "this is achieved by replacing the usual bosonic creation and annihilation operators by the correspondent spin-@xmath8 operators , i.e. we now consider * *  * * @xmath63next , we will concentrate on studying the dynamics of the system .",
    "we first split the hamiltonian into two parts : @xmath64 * * ( * * the energy operator in the absence of interaction * * ) * * and @xmath65 ( the coupling interaction ) , such that @xmath66where @xmath67 in the interaction picture generated by @xmath64 , the hamiltonian of the system is@xmath68it is clear that @xmath69 and @xmath35 become time - dependent by means of the heisenberg equations of motion .",
    "then the interaction picture hamiltonian becomes @xmath70where @xmath71 * *  * * gives rise to the generalized detuning frequency , which depends on the excitation number operator .    in order to solve the equation of motion in the interaction picture",
    ", we first observe that @xmath72 describes processes where a photon in the mode is annihilated while the atom is excited , or vice versa .",
    "then , at any time @xmath73 , the state of the system @xmath74 is expanded in terms of the states @xmath75 and @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is an eigenstate of the excitation number operator and @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote the atom in the excited and ground state , respectively .",
    "thus@xmath80 .\\]]the equation of motion for the state of the system in the interaction picture , i.e. @xmath81 , gives the following simple coupled set of differential equations for the probability amplitudes@xmath82whose general solution is@xmath83 -ib_{n}\\left ( 0\\right ) \\sqrt{1-\\frac{% \\omega _ { n}^{2}}{\\gamma _ { n}^{2}}}\\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\gamma _ { n}t}{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } e^{i\\omega _ { n}t } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & b_{n}\\left ( t\\right)=\\left\\ { b_{n}\\left ( 0\\right ) \\left [ \\cos \\left (   \\frac{\\gamma _ { n}t}{2}\\right ) + i\\frac{\\omega _ { n}}{\\gamma _ { n}}\\sin \\left (   \\frac{\\gamma _ { n}t}{2}\\right ) \\right ] -ia_{n}\\left ( 0\\right ) \\sqrt{1-\\frac{% \\omega _ { n}^{2}}{\\gamma _ { n}^{2}}}\\sin \\left ( \\frac{\\gamma _ { n}t}{2}\\right ) \\right\\ } e^{-i\\omega _ { n}t } ,   \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are determined from the initial conditions of the system and @xmath86is the generalized rabi frequency .",
    "this set of equations gives us the general solution of the problem . in order to calculate some physical quantities of interest",
    ", we still need to specify the initial photon number distribution of the field .",
    "exact solutions of generalized extensions of the jcm in the schrdinger picture have been calculated in ref.@xcite . our modified algebra ( eq.alg ) is also included in this generalization with the appropriate choice of the structure functions .",
    "unlike this approach , here we use a unitary irreducible representation of the @xmath0 algebra to describe a kerr medium , taking advantage of algebraic methods .",
    "in addition , we now explore the physical consequences of the model .",
    "since the jcm is a composite system , which includes the field and the atom sectors , the quantum properties can be described using the joint density operator * *  * * @xmath87where the subscript @xmath88  and @xmath89  refers to the atom and the field contributions .",
    "the reduced density operators are then sufficient for calculating the averages of any dynamical variables that belong exclusively to one of the components .",
    "the reduced density operators are@xmath90 , ~\\ \\ \\ \\hat{\\rho}_{\\mathcal{f}}\\left ( t\\right ) = tr_{\\mathcal{a}}\\left [ \\hat{\\rho}_{\\mathcal{af}}\\left ( t\\right ) % \\right ] , \\]]with which we are able to evaluate the expectation values of any atomic operator @xmath91 ( e.g. population inversion operator @xmath92 ) and of any field operator @xmath93 ( e.g. excitation number operator @xmath18 ) using the expressions @xmath94 , ~\\ \\",
    "\\left\\langle \\mathcal{o}_{\\mathcal{f}}\\right\\rangle = tr_{\\mathcal{f}}\\left [ \\hat{\\rho}_{\\mathcal{f}}\\left ( t\\right ) \\mathcal{o}_{\\mathcal{f}}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{meanval}\\]]the matrix density of the atom has dimension two and , unlike the usual jcm , the matrix density of the field has dimension @xmath95 .",
    "many interesting atomic quantum effects have been observed in the context of the standard jcm .",
    "perhaps the most notable is the periodic transfer of population between the ground state and the excited state .",
    "these transitions constitute * *  * * the so - called collapse and revival phenomena ( cr ) .",
    "physically , cr occur because an atom within a cavity undergoes reversible spontaneous emission , as it repeatedly emits and then reabsorbs radiation @xcite .    the general expression for the atomic population inversion is@xmath96 = \\sum_{n=0}^{2j}\\left [ \\left\\vert a_{n}\\left ( t\\right ) \\right\\vert ^{2}-\\left\\vert b_{n}\\left ( t\\right ) \\right\\vert ^{2}\\right ] , \\]]where we have used  eq . ( [ meanval ] ) .",
    "we can see that the temporal evolution of @xmath97 is essentially a result of a summation of probabilities at different rabi frequencies .    in order to compare the differences between the usual treatment and the spin model ,",
    "let us consider the atom initially in the excited state and the initial photon number distribution described by the@xmath98 coherent states , i. e. @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "thus@xmath101 .",
    "\\label{cr}\\]]we observe that this solution converges towards the usual solution of jcm as @xmath50 approaches infinity , i.e. when the @xmath6 algebra contracts to the heisenberg - weyl algebra .",
    "simultaneously , the photon number distribution of the field converges towards the poisson distribution when @xmath102 remains fixed .",
    "it is well known that the system under consideration is sensitive to the statistical properties of the electromagnetic field . in the @xmath3-deformed extensions of the jcm",
    ", it is usually considered that the field is initially prepared in a @xmath3-deformed coherent state ( an eigenstate of the @xmath103-deformed annihilation operator ) . on the other hand , in ref.@xcite the field",
    "is prepared in the multipothon holstein - primakoff @xmath5 coherent state in the framework of the standard jcm . in this work",
    "we consider both situations : an @xmath5 spin model to describe an intensity dependent coupling , together with its associated coherent state as the initial photon number distribution .     in the standard jcm in the exact resonant case .",
    "the atom is initially in the excited state and the field is initially prepared in the standard coherent state with @xmath104 photons on average . ]",
    "numerical results of the atomic inversion in the exact resonant case @xmath105 , with @xmath106 photons on average and@xmath107 , are shown in fig .",
    "it can be seen that the temporal evolution exhibits periodic collapses and revivals .",
    "this phenomenon also takes place in the spin model ; however , in this case the structure is more complex due to its dependence on the maximum number of spin excitations @xmath50 . figures ( 2a ) , ( 2b ) and ( 2c ) show the temporal evolution of @xmath108 for @xmath109 photons on average and @xmath110 and@xmath111 , respectively .",
    "we observe in fig . 2a",
    "that the sequence of cr is essentially the same as in the limiting case ( fig .",
    "1 ) , but the scaled time @xmath112 needed for the largest revival of the initial value @xmath113 depends on the maximum occupation @xmath50 .",
    "an estimate of the scaled time ( @xmath114 ) in this case gives@xmath115which agrees with the numerical results",
    ". it can be seen that when @xmath50 decreases the structure starts to deteriorate ( see fig .",
    "( 2b ) and ( 2c ) ) .",
    "due to the symmetry of the photon number distribution , i.e. @xmath116 , periodic collapses and revivals also take place for any value of @xmath117 , except for the limiting case @xmath118 . in this case , which does not occur in the standard jcm , the leading term in the sum of eq.([cr ] ) is that for which @xmath119 and therefore @xmath120 , i.e. the atom remains in the excited state .",
    "+      both theoretically and experimentally , there is an interest in a variety of statistical properties of the electromagnetic field , including the distributions of possible field energies , the photon number variance and the mandel @xmath121 parameter ( normalized second factorial moment ) @xcite:@xmath122these statistical variables offer quantitative measures of how much the field differs from a classical field . in particular",
    ", the mandel @xmath121 parameter vanishes for a poissonian distribution .",
    "it provides information about the tendency of photons to arrive in bunches : when @xmath123 the photons are bunched ( super - poisson ) , while for @xmath124 the photons are antibunched ( sub - poisson ) @xcite .",
    "it is well know that a * *  * * sub - poissonian statistics is a signature of the quantum nature of the field .",
    "averages appearing in eq.([mandel ] ) can be obtained easily from eq.(meanval ) . from figure 3(a ) we can see that the photon number distribution oscillates between sub - poissonian and super - poissonian statistics when @xmath125 .",
    "figures 3(b ) and ( c ) show that as @xmath50 decreases , @xmath121 becomes negative and the photons are antibunched . from these results",
    "we infer the purely quantum regime of the spin model for the electromagnetic field .",
    "+      to analyze the squeezing properties of the radiation field we introduce two hermitian quadrature operators:@xmath126one of the consequences of the commutation relation for these operators is the uncertainty relation @xmath127 .",
    "when either of these variances is less than @xmath128 ( uncertainty associated with the coherent field , including the vacuum ) , the state is said to be squeezed @xcite . in the usual jcm ,",
    "the cavity field surrounding a two - level atom initially excited , exhibits a time - varying pattern of squeezing both in the short time regime and during the revivals @xcite .",
    "thus the dynamics of the jcm leads to the squeezing of the radiation field , although the effect is rather weak",
    ".    the variances of the quadrature operators can be expressed through the mean values of the spin operators@xmath129 \\text{% , }",

    "we observe in figure 4(a ) that @xmath130 exhibits squeezing periodically in both cases , for @xmath131 ( blue line ) and @xmath132 ( red line ) maximum number of excitations . in figure 4(b ) it can be seen that @xmath133 is larger than the minimum even at @xmath134 . on the other hand , figures 4(c ) and ( d ) show that in the longer time behavior the uncertainties remain bounded in both cases ( for @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) .",
    "however , they always remain significantly larger than the minimum value and thus the field is no longer squeezed .",
    "in this work we have introduced a spin model which exhibits the main properties of a kerr medium to describe an intensity dependent coupling between a two - level atom and the radiation field .",
    "the model is formulated in terms of spin operators acting on a finite dimensional hilbert space , so that the number of excitations of the field is bounded from above .",
