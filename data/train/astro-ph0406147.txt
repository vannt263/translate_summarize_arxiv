    "in the study of low - mass stellar objects , the presence or absence of the li i 6708     resonance line has played an important role in ascertaining whether the object is a brown dwarf .",
    "however , the use of this so - called _ lithium test _",
    "@xcite to determine substellarity has some drawbacks .",
    "l dwarfs which lie just below the bottom or at the edge of the hydrogen - burning main - sequence may have some period in their early evolution of lithium burning , depleting their lithium abundance , decreasing the strength of the li i resonance line , and thereby suggesting they are main - sequence stars .",
    "furthermore , the depletion of lithium is age dependent , which in turn can be used as a clock under the correct conditions ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the reduction of the strength of the li i resonance line can also occur in lower temperature objects ( @xmath5  k ) , near the l / t dwarf interface , due to the sequestering of lithium into molecular species such as licl , lih , and lioh @xcite . in either case",
    ", conclusions drawn from the lithium test alone ( like age determination , or substellarity in the case of l  dwarfs ) may be inaccurate .",
    "thermochemical equilibrium calculations of cool dwarf atmospheres @xcite suggest that licl is the dominant li - bearing gas over an extended domain of the temperature - pressure diagram .",
    "licl has a large dipole moment in its ground electronic state which may give rise to an intense rovibrational line spectrum in the mid - infrared near 15.8 @xmath4 m .",
    "as such , licl may give a significant absorption feature in l and t dwarf spectra as suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the feature is observable , it could be used to estimate the total lithium elemental abundance in conjunction with optical li i observations , to confirm the equilibrium lithium chemistry models , and to provide a better test of substellarity for cool objects .    in this work ,",
    "we continue our long term project to update and complete molecular opacity data @xcite . here",
    "we present a complete line list ( transition energies and oscillator strengths ) of all allowed rovibrational transitions in the electronic ground state of @xmath1li@xmath2cl .",
    "the calculations were performed using an accurate hybrid potential and the dipole moment function of @xcite .",
    "the line list was incorporated into the stellar atmosphere code phoenix @xcite to compute spectra for a range of t  dwarf models to explore the possibility of observing licl .",
    "for the present calculations , an accurate hybrid potential was constructed for the @xmath0 electronic state from the spectral inversion fit of @xcite and from the multi - reference single- and double - excitation configuration interaction ( mrsdci ) calculations of @xcite .",
    "the fit to the effective potential energy proposed by @xcite consisted of a sum of five radial functions accounting empirically for vibrational adiabatic and nonadiabatic effects .",
    "the coefficients of this expansion were determined by direct spectral inversion from the frequencies of 2577 known transitions in the infrared and microwave spectral regions for the isotopic variants @xmath6li@xmath2cl , @xmath6li@xmath7cl , @xmath1li@xmath2cl and @xmath1li@xmath7cl .",
    "the normalized standard deviation of the fit was 0.993 over the complete domain of definition of the radial functions , i.e. for internuclear distances from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "a shift in energy of @xmath10 was applied to the ogilvie fit , in addition to a shift of @xmath11 from its original equilibrium geometry , to obtain coincidence with the _ ab initio _ energy minimum at @xmath12 determined by cubic spline interpolation from the mrsdci data of @xcite . beyond the range @xmath13 , a spline fit to the _ ab initio _ data was used , connecting smoothly with the shifted ogilvie fit . for internuclear distances",
    "@xmath14 , a fit to the multi - reference potential has been performed using the usual van der waals dispersion expansion to account for the long - range interaction . to our knowledge ,",
    "no data have been reported for the van der waals coefficients of the @xmath0 state of licl , thus theoretical estimates were obtained using average values from several techniques in a similar way as in @xcite .    in order to determine the spectroscopic constants of the @xmath0 potential ,",
    "the vibrational wave functions , @xmath15 , and energy eigenvalues , @xmath16 , have been calculated by solving with numerov techniques @xcite the radial nuclear schrdinger equation , @xmath17 \\chi_{v}(r)=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the reduced mass of the system , @xmath18 is the rotational quantum number corresponding to the angular momentum of nuclear rotation , and @xmath19 is the electronic potential energy .",
    "the reduced mass adopted for @xmath20li@xmath2cl was @xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "calculations were performed on a grid with stepsize @xmath23 for the integration , over a range of internuclear distances from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "the calculations yielded for this hybrid potential an energy difference @xmath26 and a dissociation energy @xmath27 , slightly larger than the thermochemical value , @xmath28 , of @xcite or the flame photometry measurement , @xmath29 , of @xcite .",
    "the introduction of the spin - orbit interaction in our calculations would lower the dissociation asymptote of the @xmath0 state , thereby bringing the theoretical dissociation energy into closer agreement with the experimental estimates .",
    "our theoretical vibrational constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are in excellent agreement with the accurate dunham constants @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively , derived from experiment by @xcite for @xmath20li@xmath2cl .",
    "the frequency of the first band , @xmath36 , essentially reproduces the value of @xmath37 , obtained using the dunham terms given above .",
    "the line oscillator strengths , @xmath38 , from rovibrational states @xmath39 to final state @xmath40 were computed using the @xmath0 dipole moment function of @xcite for all allowed absorption transitions between the 29,370 rovibrational levels solutions of eq .",
    "( [ re ] ) , thus giving a total of 3,357,811 linesli@xmath2cl oscillator strength data is available online at the uga molecular opacity project database website http://www.physast.uga.edu/ugamop/ ] .",
    "a standard expression for the line oscillator strength can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "computed line oscillator strengths and transition energies are reported in table [ tbl1 ] , along with the high resolution measurements of @xcite , for the @xmath41-branch @xmath42 of the fundamental vibrational band @xmath43 , for @xmath44 to 4 .",
    "the agreement is excellent , with a maximum transition energy discrepancy of @xmath45 for the @xmath46 line of the @xmath47 band .    in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , representative licl opacities , absorption cross section per molecule , are presented for pressures and temperature appropriate to t dwarfs .",
    "the opacities are computed using eq .",
    "( 6 ) of @xcite , using einstein a - coefficients from the above line lists , and multiplying by a lorentzian line profile .",
    "the full width half maximum line width is estimated by only considering collisional broadening and is typically @xmath480.1 @xmath49 at 100 atm .",
    "the rovibrational levels of licl are assumed to be in equilibrium and a correction for stimulated emission is included .",
    "the fundamental and first two vibrational overtone bands , as well as a portion of the pure rotational band , are depicted .",
    "the fundamental band , with a band origin at 15.8  @xmath4 m , is the dominant licl opacity source in the mid - infrared .",
    "we note , however , that phoenix uses molecular line lists instead of pre - computed opacity tables as described below .",
    "the atmosphere models used for this work were calculated as described in @xcite . these models and their comparisons to earlier versions were the subject of a previous publication @xcite and we thus do not repeat the detailed description of the models here .",
    "however , we will briefly summarize the major physical properties .",
    "the models are based on the ames h@xmath50o and tio line lists by @xcite and @xcite and also include the line lists for feh by @xcite and for vo and crh by r. freedman ( nasa - ames , private communication ) .",
    "we try as much as possible to constantly add new opacities as they become available ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the new feh and crh opacities recently calculated in @xcite and @xcite will soon be added to our database . however , as can be seen from these references , the new line lists calculated for feh and crh have no features ( for vibrational transitions ) in the mid - ir region where the licl feature is located .",
    "although the global opacity is expected to be changed overall using these new line lists , for the purpose and wavelength window of this paper the use of the line lists of @xcite and r. freedman is appropriate .",
    "the models account for equilibrium formation of dust and condensates and include grain opacities for 40 species . in this paper",
    "we only consider the so - called `` ames - cond '' models in which the dust particles have sunk below the atmosphere from the layers in which they originally formed .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite this limiting case is appropriate for t  dwarfs which are discussed in this paper .",
    "we stress that large uncertainties persist in the water opacities for parts of the temperature range of this work @xcite .",
    "in addition to the opacity sources listed above and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) the new licl line list presented in this paper has been added to our opacity database . in order to assess the effects of the new licl line data , we compare spectra calculated with and without this opacity source . the models used in the following discussion were all iterated to convergence for the parameters indicated .",
    "the high resolution spectra which have the individual opacity sources selected are calculated on top of the models .",
    "the licl line opacity data turned out to be too weak to influence the temperature structure of the atmosphere .",
    "the models have solar abundances with the non - depleted lithium abundance of log(n@xmath51)=3.31 .",
    "we calculated models with log(g)=3.0 , 4.0 and 5.0 and effective temperatures of 900  k , 1200  k and 1500  k which are typical parameters of old @xmath52 to young @xmath53 t  dwarfs .",
    "this parameter region turned out to be the one showing the strongest licl features .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig2 ] the effect of licl is strongest for @xmath54=1200  k and log(g)=3.0 in the ir around the fundamental vibrational band origin at 15.8 @xmath4 m and the relative flux difference is typically less than 20% overall .",
    "the general strength of the licl absorption warrants inclusion in model calculations , but the lack of a distinct feature will make it hard to detect in an observed spectrum which is dominated by water absorption .",
    "however , the model parameters @xmath54=1200  k and log(g)=3.0 are particularly interesting since these are parameters typical for very young ( and hence very bright ) mid to early t  dwarfs .",
    "using an accurate hybrid potential and fully quantum - mechanical techniques , we have constructed a comprehensive and complete theoretical line list of spectroscopic accuracy for the @xmath0 electronic ground state of @xmath1li@xmath2cl .",
    "although licl appears to be a dominant li - bearing gas over an extended domain of the @xmath55 diagram in cool dwarf atmospheres , synthetic spectra calculations with the stellar atmosphere code phoenix suggest that flux differences resulting from the incorporation of this new line list are less than 20% for parameters typical of young to old t  dwarfs . the strongest signature of licl for @xmath54=1200  k and log(g)=3.0 appears in the vicinity of the fundamental vibrational band origin at 15.8 @xmath4 m , where the spectrum is dominated by water absorption .",
    "the current results suggest that it will be difficult to measure the full inventory of elemental lithium in t  dwarfs after it is reposited into molecular species .",
