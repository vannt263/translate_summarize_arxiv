    "relativistic heavy - ion collisions provide us the methods to create and explore strongly interacting matter at high energy densities where the deconfined quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is expected to form .",
    "the properties of matter governed by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) have been studied at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "measurements performed at rhic in au + au collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath0 gev per nucleon pair and at lhc in pb + pb collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath1 tev per nucleon pair have revealed several unusual properties of this hot , dense , matter ( _ e.g. _ , its very low shear viscosity  @xcite , and its high opacity for energetic jets  @xcite ) .    due to the fast , oppositely directed , motion of two colliding ions , off - central heavy - ion collisions can create strong transient magnetic fields  @xcite . as estimated by kharzeev , mclerran , and warringa  @xcite , the magnetic fields generated in off - central au + au collision at rhic can reach @xmath2 g , which is @xmath3 times larger than the strongest man - made steady magnetic field in the laboratory . the magnetic field generated at lhc energy",
    "can be @xmath4 times larger than that at rhic  @xcite .",
    "thus , heavy - ion collisions provide a unique terrestrial environment to study qcd in strong magnetic fields .",
    "it has been shown that a strong magnetic field can convert topological charge fluctuations in the qcd vacuum into global electric charge separation with respect to the reaction plane  @xcite .",
    "this so - called _ chiral magnetic effect _ may serve as a sign of the local p and cp violation of qcd .",
    "experimentally , the star  @xcite , phenix  @xcite , and alice  @xcite collaborations have reported the measurements of the two - particle correlations of charged particles with respect to the reaction plane , which are qualitatively consistent with the chiral magnetic effect , although there are still some debates  @xcite .",
    "besides the chiral magnetic effect , there can be other effects caused by the strong magnetic fields including the catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , the possible splitting of chiral and deconfinement phase transitions  @xcite , the spontaneous electromagnetic superconductivity of qcd vacuum  @xcite , the possible enhancement of elliptic flow of charged particles  @xcite , the energy loss due to the synchrotron radiation of quarks  @xcite , the emergence of anisotropic viscosities  @xcite , the induction of the electric quadrupole moment of the qgp  @xcite , _",
    "etc_.    the key quantity of all these effects are the strength of the magnetic fields .",
    "most of the previous works estimated the magnetic - field strength based on the averaging over many events  @xcite , thus , due to the mirror symmetry of the collision geometry , only the @xmath5-component of the magnetic field remains sizable , @xmath6 , while other components are @xmath7 .",
    "hereafter , we use the angle bracket to denote event average .",
    "we choose the @xmath8 axis along the beam direction of the projectile , @xmath9 axis along the impact parameter @xmath10 from the target to the projectile , and @xmath5 axis perpendicular to the reaction plane , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ collision ] .    .",
    "here  t \" for target and  p \" for projectile.,width=264 ]    however , in many cases , the final hadronic signals are measured on the event - by - event basis .",
    "thus , it is important to study how the magnetic fields are generated on the event - by - event basis .",
    "such a study was recently initiated by bzdak and skokov  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the @xmath9-component of the magnetic field can be as strong as the @xmath5 component on the event - by - event basis , due to the fluctuation of the proton positions in the colliding nuclei .",
    "besides , they also found that the event - by - event generated electric field can be comparable to the magnetic field .",
    "the aim of our work is to give a detailed study of the space - time structure of the event - by - event generated electromagnetic fields in the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "we perform our calculation by using the heavy ion jet interaction generator ( hijing ) model  @xcite .",
    "hijing is a monte - carlo event generator for hadron productions in high energy p + p , p + a , and a + a collisions .",
    "it is essentially a two - component model , which describes the production of hard parton jets and the soft interaction between nucleon remnants . in hijing ,",
    "the hard jets production is controlled by perturbative qcd , and the interaction of nucleon remnants via soft gluon exchanges is described by the string model @xcite .",

    ". the participants will exchange their momenta and energies , and become _ remnants _ after collision . differently from the spectators and the participants",
    ", the remnants can have finite transverse momenta . in our calculation",
    ", we find that although the spectators and participants are the main sources of fields at @xmath35 , remnants can give important contributions at @xmath36 . in the hijing model",
    ", we neglect the back reaction of the electromagnetic field on the motions of the the charged particles .",

    "after collision , many partons may be produced and the hot , dense , qgp may form . as the qgp is nearly neutral ,",
    "we neglect the contributions from the produced partons to the generation of the electromagnetic field .",
    "however , if the electric conductivity of the qgp is large , the qgp can have significant response to the change of the external electromagnetic field .",

    "although the @xmath9-component of the magnetic field as well as the @xmath9- and @xmath5-components of the electric field vanish after averaging over many events , their magnitudes in each event can be huge due to the fluctuations of the proton positions in the nuclei .",

    "@xcite .    first , as we expected , the longitudinal fields @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 are much smaller than the transverse fields .",
    "second , the event - averaged fields @xmath73 and @xmath74 distribute similarly with the fields generated by two uniformly charged , oppositely moving , discs .",
    "third , the spatial distribution of the magnetic fields is very different from that of the electric fields on the event - by - event basis . for central collisions , both @xmath75 and @xmath76 distribute circularly and concentrate at @xmath37 , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 peak around @xmath79 and @xmath80 with @xmath54 the radius of the nucleus .",

    "although we used the event - averaged absolute values @xmath44 and @xmath43 to characterize the event - by - event fluctuations of the electromagnetic fields , it would have more practical relevance to see the probability distribution of the magnetic field , defined as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the number of events .",

    "we take into account the contributions from charged particles in spectators , participants , and remnants . around @xmath31",

    "these remnants can essentially slow down the decay of the transverse fields , as seen from fig .",
    "[ tdepe ] .",
    "another evident effect of the remnants is the substantial enhancements of the longitudinal magnetic and electric fields caused by the position fluctuation of the remnants , which have non - zero transverse momenta .",

    "thus it is expected that the qgp can have non - trivial electromagnetic response .",
    "such electromagnetic response can substantially influence the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields in the qgp .    to have an estimation of the electromagnetic response of qgp",
