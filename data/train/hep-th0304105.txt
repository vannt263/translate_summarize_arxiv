    "the natural appearance of noncommutativity of the canonical type in string theory @xcite  has been motivating an intensive investigation of its implications for quantum field theory and quantum mechanics @xcite .",

    "are nonlocality and ir - uv mixing @xcite , new physics at very short distances @xcite , and the possible implications of lorentz violation @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    ", a great deal of  effort has been devoted to the search for evidence of possible manifestations of noncommutative effects in cosmology and high - energy and low - energy experiments  @xcite .",
    "noncommutative quantum mechanics ( ncqm ) has also been an issue of great interest ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "in addition to its possible phenomenological relevance @xcite , the study of ncqm is motivated by the opportunity it gives us  to understand problems that are present in noncommutative quantum field theory ( ncqft ) , and perhaps in string theory , in a framework easy to handle @xcite-@xcite .    in previous work",
    "@xcite , a new interpretation for the canonical commutation relation consideration,@xmath0=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu},\\label{1}\\ ] ] was proposed .",
    "according to the point of view exposed there , it is possible to interpret the commutation relation ( [ 1 ] ) as a property of the particle coordinate observables , rather than of the  spacetime coordinates .",
    "this fact was shown to have implications for the way of performing the calculations of ncqft and enforced a reinterpretation of the meaning of the wave function in ncqm .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of developing a bohmian interpretation @xcite for ncqm .",
    "we shall benefit from the ideas presented in @xcite to develop a deterministic theory of hidden variables that exhibit canonical noncommutativity ( [ 1 ] ) between the particle position observables .",
    "presently , there are several motivations for the reconsideration of hidden - variable theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we are now sure that the copenhagen interpretation is not the unique framework where quantum phenomena can be described .",
    "many theoreticians consider it more as a provisory set of rules than as the fundamental theory of quantum physics .",
    "alternative points of view have been proposed that claim to solve some alleged difficulties of the copenhagen interpretation @xcite .",
    "it is a result of bell @xcite that any hidden - variables model that leads to the same results predicted by quantum theory must itself be nonlocal . historically , the possibility that a measurement process at one point can have an immediate effect at a point separated in space was uncomfortable for physicists , and totally abhorrent to einstein in particular @xcite . for long time ,",
    "local models were by far the preferred ones , but nowadays there is no fundamental reason for that .",
    "noncommutative theories , as well as string theory , have been shown not to be local , at least in the usual sense @xcite .",
    "thus , as long as one considers a noncommutative theory , the ( historical ) objection against hidden - variables models for their nonlocal character is clearly senseless . in reality , the study of noncommutative theories using hidden variables is strongly motivated by the detailed information such a description can  provide us if compared to the one of the  copenhagen interpretation .",
    "currently , however , there is a lack of investigation in this direction , and we are aware of just one work combining noncommutative geometry with a hidden - variables  model @xcite , where stochastic quantization is employed .    among the hidden - variables theories , the bohmian one occupies a distinguished position .",
    "it has been an object of intensive investigation and application in a wide range of branches of physics ,  like quantum field theory @xcite , the phenomenology of high - energy physics @xcite , condensed matter and atomic - molecular physics @xcite , among others @xcite .",
    "the enormous resurgence of interest in the bohmian interpretation comes from multiple directions . from the experimental point of view",

    "techniques using ion traps may allow information on the behavior of individual particles to be obtained @xcite .",
    "this makes the bohmian formulation using particle trajectories especially attractive for investigation , since it allows the description of individual systems .",
    "moreover ,  the applicability of this interpretation transcends the discussion of the foundations of quantum theory , since the bohmian formalism can be adopted for `` non - bohmian '' physicists as a tool to get intuition about the nature of quantum phenomena by the detailed description of the underlying dynamics it provides ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the theoretical framework , there is a large number of phenomena that do not fit comfortably within the standard operator quantum formalism of the orthodox copenhagen interpretation . among them",
    ", we quote dwell and tunneling times @xcite , escape times and escape positions @xcite , and scattering theory @xcite .",
    "they are easily handled by bohm s ontological approach @xcite .",
    "the main motivation to develop a  bohmian interpretation for ncqm in this work is the variety of evidence indicating that noncommutativity must , in some way , be related to a quantum theory of gravitation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; consequently , it may have implications for quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "the inadequacy of the application of the copenhagen interpretation for quantum cosmology has been stressed for a long time by many prominent physicists , like feynman  @xcite ( a review of the subject may be found in @xcite ) . as an alternative to the copenhagen interpretation ,",
    "the bohmian one is employed in several works of quantum cosmology ( see @xcite and references therein ) . thus , it is important to investigate , having in mind future applications for this area , if canonical noncommutativity is compatible with the bohmian interpretation of quantum theory .",

    "finally , in sec.iv , we end up with a general discussion and  a summary of the main results .",
    "the essential ncqm necessary for this work ( for details see @xcite )  is summarized in what follows . according to the weyl quantization procedure @xcite , the realization of the commutation relation ( [ 1 ] ) between position observables is given by the moyal star product defined as below :",

    "the bohmian approach to quantum theory is founded on the assumption that the complete characterization of a quantum system can not be provided by a wave function alone .",

    "the impossibility of simultaneously determining the position and momentum of a particle is attributed to the perturbation introduced on @xmath69 by the evolution of the wave function during the measurement process @xcite .",

    "( [ 38 ] ) , one finds @xmath149 . since @xmath150  one still has noncommutative effects in the corresponding orbit , but they have a  genuinely quantum nature .",
    "the minimum value allowed for @xmath127 occurs when @xmath151 for both @xmath142 and @xmath143 states .",
    "its value is@xmath152  for @xmath142 , and @xmath153 for @xmath143 .",
    "there is an interesting property of the noncommutative harmonic oscillator that is rendered evident by its bohmian description .",
    "observe in fig . 1 that , for each value of@xmath136",
    "there correspond two values of @xmath137 , one smaller than @xmath154 and the  other larger .",
    "the smallest values of @xmath137  contained in the interval @xmath155",
    "@xmath156 have as their partners exactly the largest ones in the interval @xmath157 . in the ordinary commutative  bohmian interpretation",
    ", there is a contextual character in the information provided by the wave function to guide the particle motion ( for details see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the information for the particle to move , however , is extracted by the particle from the part of the wave function that is spread over the spatial points which cover the particle position and a small neighborhood around it .",
    "what we find in the noncommutative bohmian harmonic oscillator is a new and interesting property , over and above the contextuality of ordinary bohmian mechanics . for the case where the system has a large physical radius",
    ", it may be receiving information from part of the wave function that is concentrated in a small region far beyond the position where the particle is located .",
    "this property is similar to the ir - uv mixing that occurs in field theory @xcite and is a manifestation of the specific kind of nonlocality found in ncqm due to the `` shift '' in the interaction point in eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "in this work we carried out an investigation of the possibility of developing a bohmian interpretation for ncqm . the theory was proposed to be based on a commutative spacetime containing point particles , whose position observables should satisfy the canonical relation ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "such a realization of noncommutativity only between particle position observables means that , although the particles are point like , their complete localization in a process of measurement is forbidden by the disturbances caused by the measurement apparatus interacting with the quantum system .",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty of the particle localization during a measurement process must be faced on the same footing as the one forbidding the simultaneous determination of the momentum and the position of the particle in ordinary bohmian  theory .    in the manner",
    "it was constructed , bncqm was conceived  to reproduce the same statistical predictions of ncqm in the copenhagen interpretation with a continuous evolution law for particle motion . as a result of  our investigation of the possibility for this to occur , we found that , when linear and quadratic potentials are considered in the hamiltonian , the theory in its present form is certainly statistically equivalent to ncqm in the copenhagen interpretation .",
    "the same may also occur for other specific potential terms or physical states where eqs .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 31.5 ] ) do match .",
    "when this is not the case , for the theories predictions to agree , it is necessary to modify the particle evolution law .",
    "one interesting way this may be done is by considering a `` hybrid '' evolution law constituted of a continuous part governed by a differential equation added to a stochastic piece , which allows the particles to jump , along the lines adopted in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 31.5 ] ) in this case should be understood as a probability transport equation of a piecewise - deterministic jump process .    among the physical systems of interest where bncqm with a continuous particle motion is able to reproduce the copenhagen interpretation results",
    "is the harmonic oscillator .",
    "although very specific , the harmonic potential is of great relevance for physics , which justifies the enormous variety of work on ncqm devoted to it ( see @xcite and references therein ) . indeed , in this work , the harmonic oscillator proved to be useful to illustrate essential properties of ncqm in the spirit of the bohmian interpretation . in its fine description of the harmonic oscillator ,",
    "bncqm revealed the interesting possibility that the small - scale physics can influence the large - scale phenomena in the quantum - mechanical context , in close similarity to the ir - uv mixing that appears in field theory .",
    "another important contribution of the bohmian interpretation comes from its capability to give well - defined predictions in situations where the copenhagen interpretation is vague , as discussed in sec .",
    "an interesting environment where the predictions of the bohmian interpretation may be confronted in future with experimentation is that of quantum cosmology .",
    "recently , noncommutativity at early times of the universe was introduced by deforming the commutation relation among the minisuperspace variables  in a cosmological model based on the kantowski - sachs metric @xcite , originating a noncommutative wheeler - dewitt equation . since in the formalism of minisuperspace",
    "the wheeler - dewitt equation is essentially quantum mechanical , the application of the bohmian interpretation developed in this work for models like the one of @xcite is almost immediate @xcite .",
    "it may reveal unknown features or unexpected results , since it will allow a description of the primordial quantum universe following a well - defined `` trajectory '' in minisuperpace . in  the  case of conceiving a quantum cosmology based on the canonical noncommutativity of the spatial coordinates ( [ 1 ] ) , for example",
    ", the ideas presented in this work may also be a good starting point .",
    "since the ontological interpretations have variants and are still under construction , this work should not be considered a closed structure .",
    "many of the rules stated  here are open and may be subject to reformulation after further discussion .",
    "in addition to the interesting possibility for a bohmian description with stochastic particle jumps to shed light on the interpretation of all terms in eq .",
    "( [ 31.5 ] ) , which compels us to carry on an extension of the theory presented here , there are many open questions to be exploited in the formulation . among them",
    ", we quote the extension of the theory to incorporate a many - body approach , where some care must be taken when considering charged particles @xcite , for example .",
    "the authors are greatly indebted to jos helayel - neto and roderich tumulka  for relevant comments and for all the  corrections  to earlier versions of the manuscript .",
