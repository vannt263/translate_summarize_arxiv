    "the pervasive use of wireless networks and the miniaturization have lead to the existence of wbans .",
    "a person wears low power and cost sensor devices forms a star topology wban coordinated by single coordinator c. these sensors may be implanted inside or attached on human body .",
    "they can be used in various applications such as health monitoring , ubiquitous healthcare , sports and military .",
    "wbans mainly monitor physical activities and capture vital signs as glucose percentage in blood , heart beats , respiration , body temperature and/or can record electrocardiography ( ecg ) @xcite .",
    "recently , the ieee 802.15.6 working group has defined new phy and mac layer proposals for wbans .",
    "the standard requires the whole system to maintain proper function when up to 10 wbans are co - located within a transmission range of 3 meters @xcite .",
    "it has also adopted the two - hop communication scheme in the standard .",
    "thus , adopting relay transmission is a very promising solution for co - channel interference reduction , energy efficiency and high reliable communications @xcite .",
    "the unpredictable nature of wbans and the high mobility make the coordination very hard .",
    "due to the broadcast nature in wbans , the nodes concurrently transmitting suffer from co - channel interference as acive periods can overlap .",
    "co - channel interference problem motivates for the stringent requirements of interference avoidance schemes and protocols for reliable and energy efficient operation of wbans . on the other hand , due to the constrained nature of wbans ( in terms of energy , size and cost )",
    ", advanced antenna techniques can not be used for interference avoidance as well as power control mechanisms used in cellular networks are not applicable to wbans @xcite .",
    "however , in this work , we focus our attention on problems related to co - channel interference and energy savings of a single wban . thus , novel methods and schemes are required for intra - wban interference avoidance / mitigation .",

    "recent studies show multi - hop schemes have a lower power consumption in comparison to one - hop scheme",
    ". however , using relays reduces the wban interference and consequently the power consumption .",
    "authors of @xcite propose a single - relay cooperative scheme where the best relay is selected in a distributed fashion .",
    "also , authors of @xcite propose a prediction - based dynamic relay transmission scheme through which the problem of `` when to relay '' and `` who to relay '' are decided in an optimal way .",

    "authors of @xcite investigate the problem of coexistence of multiple non coordinated wbans .",
    "this study provides better co - channel interference mitigation .",
    "however , more recent works conducted in @xcite propose a scheme for joint two - hop relay - assisted cooperative communication integrated with transmit power control .",
    "this scheme can reduce co - channel interference and extend the lifetime .",
    "on the other hand , other works prove that tdma scheme is an attractive solution to avoid interference within an intra - wban .",
    "authors of @xcite enables two or three coexisting wbans to agree on a common tdma schedule to reduce the interference .",
    "the work in @xcite adopts a tdma polling - based scheme for traffic coordination inside a wban and a carrier sensing ( cs ) mechanism to deal with inter - wban interference .",

    "they evaluate the performance in terms of bit error rate , throughput and lifetime which have been improved by adoption of an optimized time hopping code assignment strategy .",
    "works in @xcite consider a wban where coordinator periodically queries sensors to transmit data .",
    "the network adopts the csma / ca and the nodes adopt link adaptation to select the modulation scheme according to the experienced channel quality .",
    "the research work of @xcite solves the problem of inter - wban scheduling and interference by the adoption of a qos based mac preemptive priority scheduling approach .",

    "since tdma is the most widely used protocol inside wbans .",
    "most of the recent works do not address problems related to interference minimization and energy maximization inside a wban .",

    ", we propose a distributed scheme ( iaa ) for interference avoidance inside a wban .",
    "the proposed scheme enables low interfering nodes to use base channel for transmitting to relays .",

    "we define @xmath41 as the probabilistic approach deployment probability that a sensor node of wban doubles its contention window is then : @xmath42 which is greater than @xmath43 = @xmath44 .",
    "we have considered a static wban consisting of n = 12 source nodes and a set of relay nodes r = 4 located in an area of 2@xmath452 @xmath46 .",
    "all the nodes operate in a half - duplex mode and use the same transmission power at 0 dbm . in this simulation , we focus our attention on the performance of three important metrics ; minimum sinr , outage probability and wban energy residue . for brevity , the rest of simulation parameters are listed in table [ tab : title ] above .",
    ".simulation parameters [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      we have chosen the most common metric sinr to evaluate the interference level and show how better our proposed iaa scheme mitigates the interference than other schemes .",
    "the minimum sinr ( @xmath47 ) of the wban versus time for iaa scheme is compared to the cooperative communication integrated with transmit power control ( pc ) @xcite and csma / ca with opportunistic relaying ( or ) @xcite schemes . as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ iaasinr ] , iaa scheme achieves a higher @xmath47 ( 12db improvement ) than pc and or schemes .",
    "pc provides a higher @xmath47 ( 7db improvement ) than or scheme since the former adopts the power control mechanism where the nodes ( sources and relays ) dynamically adjust their power level . accordingly",
    ", controlling power reduces the interference at other nodes of wban and hence improving their @xmath47 .",
    "when some nodes experience high interference , they have to wait the channel to become free and then retry .",
    "however , instead of waiting , in the proposed iaa scheme , these high interfering nodes extend the cw and probably switch to reserved channel for avoiding interference and so their corresponding @xmath47s are increased .",
    "furthermore , only iaa use flexible tdma to communicate to c for avoiding the interference . as a result",
    ", our proposed iaa scheme avoids the wban interference through increasing the minimum sinr .",
    "we have evaluated the average sinr @xmath0 of the wban versus the sinr threshold @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ op ] , where a higher @xmath0 which corresponds to a lower outage probability is obtained when the interference threshold is increased .",
    "this figure compares the average @xmath0 for the proposed iaa scheme and that for the or scheme .",
    "as can be clearly seen in this figure , the proposed iaa scheme achieves a higher average @xmath0 for all sinr interference thresholds greater than -45 db which is quite efficient in the case of wbans .",
    "thus , increasing sinr interference thresholds puts more sensors in the interference set .",
    "these sensors will use cw extension mechanism and probably the reserved channel to avoid the interference and hence improving their sinrs .",
    "in addition , it is evident to see , when the interference threshold reaches -45 db , the proposed iaa scheme approaches the or scheme in terms of average @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is important to note that the interference threshold can be adaptively selected according to the interference level .          in order to evaluate our proposed iaa scheme",
    "how better extends the energy lifetime of the wban than other schemes .",
    "we have chosen energy residue which is linearly related to the most stringent factor ( energy ) in wbans .",
    "we define wban energy residue ( er ) at time t as the sum of remaining energies in the battery of each sensor of the wban .",
    "er versus time for three different schemes is compared and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] .",
    "as can be clearly seen in this figure , er of iaa scheme outperforms and is always higher than er of or and pc schemes .",
    "er of iaa decreases slightly whilst in the other schemes decreases sharply .",
    "this ensures a longer wban energy lifetime .",
    "however , with the proposed iaa scheme , the packet collisions and retransmissions are also minimized because all the interfering nodes dynamically use the cw extension mechanism and probably the channel switching technique . in pc scheme , a power control mechanism adjusts dynamically the power level at sources and relays and hence reducing the energy consumption in the whole wban . on the other hand ,",
    "the absence of power control from or scheme increases the energy consumption at the sources and relays and thus shortening the energy lifetime of the whole wban . as a result",
    ", our proposed iaa scheme outperforms other schemes and better extends the wban s energy lifetime .",
    "furthermore , adopting a flexible tdma ( pc and or do not adopt ) in our proposed scheme to avoid interference decreases also the whole wban energy consumption .",
    "in this paper , we propose a distributed cooperative multi - hop scheme ( iaa ) adopts contention window extension mechanism integrated with channel switching technique to avoid co - channel interference of a single wban .",
    "we also propose a flexible tdma between relays and coordinator .",
    "our proposal aims to avoid co - channel interference and extends the wban energy lifetime .",
    "furthermore , our proposed iaa scheme has been evaluated by simulation and compared with other schemes showing 12db improvement in the minimum sinr and significantly extends the wban energy lifetime .",
    "additionally , theoretical analysis validated our approach .",
    "thus , we propose a probabilistic approach and prove the outage probability is reduced to the minimal . as a future work ,",
