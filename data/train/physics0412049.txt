    "it is well known that if very fast , rapidly oscillating signals propagate in a real medium , they undergo the dispersion phenomenon . various frequency components of a signal",
    "propagate with different phase velocities , and they are differently dumped . as a result ,",
    "the shape of the signal is distorted during propagation the signal in the medium .",
    "naturally , this phenomenon is practically important only at very short times and very high frequencies ( of the order of @xmath0 hz and above in the assumed model ) . in now classical works sommerfeld @xcite and brillouin @xcite have shown that in the lorentz model of a dispersive medium , apart of the main signal two small precursors are formed . in the asymptotic description of the total field",
    "these precursors are interpreted as contributions to the field resulting from two different pairs of saddle points . for the sommerfeld precursor pertinent simple saddle points vary outside some disc in a complex frequency plane . as the space - time",
    "coordinate @xmath1 , to be defined later , takes the initial value equal unity , those points merge at infinity to form one saddle point of infinite order .",
    "as @xmath1 grows up to infinity , they separate into two simple saddle points that move symmetrically with respect to the imaginary axis towards corresponding branch points located in the left and the right half - plane , respectively . in the case of brillouin precursor ,",
    "two other simple saddle points vary inside a smaller disc . as the coordinate @xmath1 grows from unity , they move toward each other along the imaginary axis , coalesce into one saddle point of the second order on the axis , and then again split into simple saddle points that depart from the axis and move , symmetrically with respect to this axis , towards corresponding branch points in the left and the right half - plane , respectively .",
    "the location of the saddle points affects local oscillations and dumping of the precursor .",
    "it depends on the space - time coordinate @xmath1 and is governed by the saddle point equation .    in this paper",
    "we confine our attention to the brillouin precursor , also called a second precursor ( as opposed to the first , sommerfeld precursor ) . fundamental work on this precursor is due to brillouin @xcite . because of limitations of asymptotic methods then available ( now referred to as non - uniform methods )",
    ", brillouin could not correctly describe the precursor s dynamics for values of @xmath1 corresponding to the coalescence of simple saddle points into one saddle point of a higher order . with the development of advanced , uniform asymptotic techniques , complete description of the precursor now got feasible ( kelbert and sazonov @xcite , and oughstun and sherman @xcite ) . in the latter monograph , in addition to the delta function pulse , the unit step - function modulated signal and the rectangular modulated signal , the authors also studied an initial signal with finite rate of growth . in their model , however , the envelope of the initial signal is described by everywhere smooth function of time , tending to zero as time goes to minus infinity ( @xcite , sec .",
    "4.3.4 ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider more realistic excitation which is caused by an abruptly switched modulated sine signal , vanishing identically for time @xmath2 and being non - zero for @xmath3 . at @xmath4 the derivative of the signal s envelope suffers a step discontinuity . as @xmath5 increases , the envelope grows with a finite speed , asymptotically tending to its maximum value . in the following sections we construct uniform asymptotic representation for the brillouin precursor resulting from this sort of excitation , and show how the speed of growth in the initial signal affects the form of the precursor .",
    "we also illustrate the results with numerical examples .",
    "we consider a one dimensional electromagnetic problem of propagation in a lorentz medium .",
    "the medium is characterized by the frequency - dependent complex index of refraction @xmath6 where @xmath7",
    "is so called plasma frequency of the medium , @xmath8 is a damping constant and @xmath9 is a characteristic frequency .",
    "any electromagnetic field in the medium satisfies the maxwell equations @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a real function and @xmath12 is a real constant ( hereafter assumed to be equal 1 ) . by fourier transforming the equations with respect to @xmath5 and assuming that the fields depend on one spatial coordinate @xmath13 only , we obtain the following equations for transforms of the respected fields @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the unit vector directed along @xmath13-axis and @xmath16 is the fourier transform of @xmath17 .",
    "it then follows that @xmath15 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are mutually perpendicular .",
    "moreover , if @xmath18 is known then @xmath19 is also known , and vice versa .",
    "it is also true for the electromagnetic field components , which are the inverse fourier transforms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "the technique is also conveniently described in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "they coalesce to form a second order saddle point at @xmath50 .",
    "finally , as @xmath1 tends to infinity they depart from the axis and symmetrically approach the points @xmath51 in the right and in the left complex @xmath30 half plane , respectively . if @xmath52 is eliminated from ( [ e8 ] ) then the equation can be represented in the form of an eighth degree polynomial in @xmath30 on its left hand side , and zero on its right hand side .",

    "we shall employ the solution to ( [ e8 ] ) which was obtained numerically .",

    "for relatively small @xmath25 the term proportional to @xmath162 dominates over the term proportional to @xmath163 . in this case",
    "the ratio of both terms remains unchanged in a wide interval of @xmath25 variation .",

    "the contribution from @xmath162 decreases to another constant level and is very small compared to the other term . at this stage",

    "is plotted against the parameter @xmath25 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is seen again that after fast growth of the envelope magnitude at relatively small values of @xmath25 , which occurs with approximately the same rate for all @xmath1 , the magnitude reaches a saturation level at higher values of @xmath25 . since the saturation appears earlier at larger values of @xmath1 , the precursor envelope has a tendency to become narrower with growing @xmath25 .",
    "additionally , one observes that with growing @xmath25 the first extremum moves towards larger values of @xmath1 . this is a direct consequence of the fact that the first extremum of the airy function is shifted towards negative values of its argument as compared to the first extremum of the derivative of the airy function .",
    "it has an additional effect on narrowing the precursor shape .",
    "in this paper we have derived the uniform and non - uniform asymptotic representations for the brillouin precursor in a lorentz medium , excited by an incident signal of finite rise time , and well defined , startup time . with the use of these representations we analyzed the effect of the speed parameter @xmath25 on the form and magnitude of the precursor .",
    "the results obtained can be helpful e.g.  in applications involving triggering devices that work with signal amplitudes close to the noise level . in this paper",
