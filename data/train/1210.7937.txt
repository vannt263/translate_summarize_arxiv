    "the formalism of the linear response ( lr ) theory has been presented in a recent series of articles written by the nesq collaboration  @xcite for the case of a general skyrme functional  @xcite including spin - orbit and tensor interactions .",
    "such a formalism can be adopted as a useful tool to detect instabilities that plague skyrme functionals  @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we present an improved fitting protocol to build skyrme functionals , that , for the first time , includes the stability of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) up to a given density as an additional constraint .",
    "such method is more powerful than the standard constraints on the landau parameters , since the latter are only valid in the so called _ long - wavelength _ limit and are therefore not able to detect finite - size instabilities .",
    "an example of this kind of instabilities has been revealed by lesinski _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and was shown to be related to large values of @xmath0 , the coupling constant of the term @xmath1 in the skyrme functional  @xcite .",
    "this coupling constant , if not properly constrained during the fitting procedure , can drive the merit function @xmath2 used to adjust the parameters of the interaction in a region of matter fluctuations that give unphysical properties for the ground state of some nuclei . since this gradient term does not contribute to the landau parameters , this kind of instabilities is only detectable trough the lr method .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section  [ edf ] we recall the main properties of a skyrme functional and in section  [ lr : theory ] we briefly remind the lr formalism ; in section  [ results ] we present the results of our new fitting method and finally we give our conclusions in section  [ concl ] .",
    "the density - dependent skyrme interaction considered in the present article has the standard form @xmath3\\nonumber\\\\ & + t_{2}(1+x_{2}\\hat{p}_{\\sigma } ) \\mathbf{k}'\\cdot   \\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{k}\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\mathrm{i}\\,w_{0}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol\\sigma}_{1 } + \\hat{\\boldsymbol\\sigma}_{2 } ) \\cdot \\left [ \\mathbf{k}'\\times \\delta(\\mathbf{r})\\mathbf{k}\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath4 and @xmath5 for the relative and center of mass coordinates , respectively .",
    "we also defined @xmath6 the spin exchange operator , while @xmath7 is the relative momentum acting on the right and @xmath8 its complex conjugate acting on the left .",
    "finally @xmath9 is the scalar - isoscalar density of the system .",
    "the energy density functional ( edf ) is derived by keeping all the terms except the coulomb exchange one which is treated using the slater approximation .",
    "the center of mass correction is approximated by its one - body part .",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) response function in each channel @xmath10 ( spin , projection of the spin and isospin ) is obtained by solving the bethe - salpeter equations for the correlated green functions @xmath11 written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the unperturbed _ particle - hole _",
    "propagator , and @xmath14 is the residual interaction obtained through second functional derivative techniques .",
    "we refer to articles  @xcite for more details . once eqs .",
    "( [ bethesalpeter ] ) are solved , we can calculate the response function of the system with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transferred energy and @xmath17 is the transferred momentum . as usual we chose the momentum @xmath17 oriented along the @xmath18axis of the reference frame .",
    "we also use natural units @xmath19 to simplify the notations .",
    "when an instability appears in the infinite system , it manifests itself by a pole in the response function @xmath20 at zero energy .    in figure",
    "[ critical : skp ] we show the positions of the poles in snm for the skyrme skp  @xcite functional .",
    "we observe that in the channel @xmath21 , there is a pole for @xmath22  @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xmath25 .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that such functional is not stable : performing high precision hartree - fock calculations ( hf ) using a sufficient number of iterations , the code converges to a solution where protons and neutrons are separated in clusters .",
    "the same conclusion was found for other skyrme functionals , for example the lns  @xcite one .",
    "such unphysical configurations were discovered to be related to an excessive contribution of the term proportional to @xmath1 in the functional .    performing extensive hf calculations for even - even  @xcite and odd - even nuclei  @xcite",
    ", we have found that there exists a relation between the position of the poles of the response function in snm and the instabilities in finite nuclei . to guarantee that a nucleus will not manifest finite - size instabilities we have imposed the empirical constraint @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the saturation density of snm .",
    "such relation has to be satisfied for all the spin / isospin channels .",
    "the only instability that we allow to exist in the density region @xmath28 is the spinodal instability , that manifests in the @xmath29 channel at low densities and low transferred momenta and characterizes the liquid - gas phase transition of nuclear matter . using such criterion allows to quickly test large sets of skyrme functionals .",
    "this is a great advantage compared to self consistent cranking calculations  @xcite and systematic quasi - particle blocking calculations  @xcite used to reveal the instabilities in spin channels .",
    "usually , the time - odd terms of the functional are not directly constrained to observables .",
    "indirect constraints may come from the fact that some functionals have been constructed with the requirements that the time odd terms lead to landau parameters satisfying the conditions @xmath30 for @xmath31 and equivalent ones for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these conditions are used to prevent the appearance of global spin and/or isospin instabilities , but do not prevent the formation of finite size instabilities due to the gradient terms such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 for isospin @xmath36 .",
    "+    an example of such spin instability has been found with the sly5  @xcite functional . in figure",
    "[ critical ] we show the position of the poles of the response function in snm .",
    "we notice that there is a pole in the channel @xmath37 close to saturation density that does not respect the criterium given in eq .",
    "( [ crit : stability ] ) . performing time - dependent - hartree - fock ( tdhf ) calculations , fracasso _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the functional sly5 is indeed unstable against spin - dipole excitations .",
    "using the results discussed in the previous section , we now present a new fitting protocol to build stable skyrme functionals .",
    "we use a modern version of the saclay - lyon fitting protocol similar to the one presented in the recent article of washiyama _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . on top of such protocol",
    "we add the constraint given by eq  ( [ crit : stability ] ) .",
    "this constraint is enforced at each iteration of the fit and does not significantly change the execution time since , as already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , since the expressions of the response functions are analytical .    using the sly5 functional as a starting point",
    ", we decided to build a new functional with similar properties , but without instabilities in the spin channel . the resulting functional has been called sly5 * and its coupling constants",
    "are reported in table  [ tab : forces ] . in the same table",
    "we compare nuclear matter properties at the saturation point for the new sly5 * and the original sly5 , showing that they all are essentially equals but the thomas - reiche - kuhn enhancement factor @xmath38 which is larger with sly5*. the value obtained with sly5 * is in agreement with the empirical value  @xcite close to @xmath39 .",
    ".parameters of the skyrme functionals used in the article . in the last lines we give the main snm properties around saturation for these functionals : binding energy per nucleon @xmath40 , saturation density @xmath27 , isoscalar effective mass @xmath41 , incompressibility @xmath42 , symmetry energy coefficient @xmath43 and the thomas - reiche - kuhn enhancement factor @xmath38 . [ cols= \" < , > , < , > , < \" , ]      in order to compare the isoscalar and isovector properties of the functionals sly5 and sly5",
    "* we have calculated the equation of state ( eos ) of snm and pnm as well as the neutron effective mass in these to extreme media .    in the upper panel of figure  [ eos ]",
    ", we show the equations of state for snm and pure neutron matter ( pnm ) . we observe a very good agreement between the results given by two functionals . in snm",
    "the two curves stay on top of each other and in pnm this is the case up to 2 to 3 times saturation density .    in the lower panel of the same figure",
    ", we report the evolution of the neutron effective mass in snm and pnm . in snm , the curves that give the neutron effective mass @xmath44 as a function of the density stay on top of each and can not be distinguished . in the pnm case ,",
    "the neutron effective mass obtained from sly5 is systematically lower than the effective mass in snm .",
    "one can also observe that sly5 * almost gives the same evolution for the neutron effective mass in snm and in pnm .",
    "the origin of this property can be clarified by writing the expressions for the neutron effective masse in the two media in terms of coupling constants  @xcite @xmath45 these coupling constants are @xmath46  mev@xmath47 and @xmath48  mev@xmath47 for the new sly5 * and @xmath49  mev@xmath47 and @xmath50  mev@xmath47 for the original sly5 . we observe that while the two isoscalar coupling constants are very similar the isovector one are very different .",
    "this , according to eq .",
    "( [ eff : mass ] ) , explains the difference between the effective masses predicted by sly5 and sly5 * as seen in figure  [ eos ] .",
    "the fact that sly5 * gives similar effective mass for the neutron in snm and pnm is due to the very small value of @xmath51 obtained with this interaction .      to further test the quality of the new sly5 * interaction , we calculated the binding energies of a set of semi - magic nuclei using the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) method .",
    "for the _ particle - hole _ channel we use the two functionals sly5 and sly5 * while for the _ particle - particle _ channel we used a contact pairing interaction surface - type .    with such choice",
    "we obtain an average pairing gap  @xcite @xmath52  mev for sly5 and @xmath53  mev for sly5*. we compare the resulting binding energies with the experimental ones given by audi _",
    "et al . _",
    "we observe that there is no significant qualitative difference between the two functionals for this set of nuclei .",
    "the binding energies predicted with sly5 * are in average slightly smaller than with sly5 but both functional compare with the experimental data with the same average deviation .",
    "+   +      in fig.[cradii ] we compare the charge radii obtained with the two functionals against the experimental results taken from the unedf web page  .",
    "once again , we observe that sly5 and sly5 * show the same behavior and the agreement between theory and experiment is of the same level .",
    "+      following the work done in ref.@xcite , we tested the stability of the new force sly5 * in self - consistent cranking calculations . for this purpose , we calculated a high - spin state of the ground super - deformed band of of @xmath54hg , that is at @xmath55 ( natural units ) , going up to several thousands iterations .",
    "we observe that sly5 * is perfectly stable and does not display the problems detected with sly5 , which typically leads to systematic non - convergence within few iterations .",
    "we have shown that , with the inclusion of the lr method into the fitting protocol , it is possible to build functionals that do not present instabilities . as a first example",
    ", we used this improved protocol to cure the spin instability present in sly5 .",
    "the resulting functional has a comparable level of accuracy as the original one for the prediction of relevant observables as binding energies and charge radii for the set of semi - magic nuclei considered here , moreover most of the relevant infinite nuclear matter properties are unchanged only the thomas - reiche - kuhn enhancement factor is significantly larger .",
