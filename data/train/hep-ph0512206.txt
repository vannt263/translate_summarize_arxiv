    "there have been major breakthroughs in understanding high - density qcd evolution recently .",
    "several important observations have been made : ( i ) gluon number fluctuations have a big effect on the evolution towards gluon saturation  @xcite , ( ii ) a connection between high - energy qcd evolution and statistical physics models of reaction - diffusion type was found  @xcite which has clarified the interpretation of fluctuations in an event - by - event picture , and ( iii ) it was realized that the relevant fluctuations are missed  @xcite by the existing balitsky - jimwlk equations  balitsky:1995ub+x , jalilian - marian:1997jx+x .",
    "these observations have led to the creation of new qcd evolution equations which include gluon number fluctuations or pomeron loops  mueller:2005ut , iancu:2005nj , kovner:2005nq , hatta:2005rn .",
    "the new equations describe the usual bfkl evolution , pomeron splittings and pomeron mergings and , thus , through iterations , pomeron loops .",
    "a lot is known about the structure of the new equations  kovner:2005en+x , blaizot:2005vf+x , marquet:2005hu , levin:2005au , enberg:2005cb , however , because of their complexity , little about their solutions .",
    "so far , analytical results for the energy dependence of the saturation momentum and for the scaling behavior of the @xmath1-matrix at asymptotic energies  mueller:2004se , iancu:2004iy and some numerical simulations of approximations to the exact equations  @xcite are available . solutions to the new equations in the range of collider energies are desired .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a toy model which has a structure similar to that of the new qcd evolution equations , but which has no transverse dimensions .",
    "this simplification allows an exact solution of the evolution equations .",
    "the particle - particle scattering amplitude is calculated .",
    "the effects of saturation and unitarity , or pomeronloops which are the characteristics of the new evolution equations , are investigated .",
    "a decade ago , mueller  @xcite studied a similar toy model without transverse dimensions which was motivated by the qcd dipole model  @xcite",
    ". he has been able to solve the toy model exactly and calculate the @xmath2-matrix .",
    "observations made by studying this toy model ( e.g. the one that fluctuations in particle numbers lead to a divergent multiple scattering series ) have been shown numerically  salam:1995uy , salam:1995zd to be valid also in the four - dimensional qcd .",
    "the hope that some of the results obtained in the toy model discussed in this paper may also apply in four - dimensional qcd is one of the motivations for this work .    in the toy model proposed by mueller  @xcite ,",
    "particle - particle scattering in the center - of - mass frame at total rapidity @xmath3 was considered . in this model",
    ", each particle evolves to a dense system through particle branching ( splitting ) .",
    "unitarity effects ( at leading order accuracy ) are correctly described due to the multiple scatterings between the dense systems .",
    "there are no particle mergings in the wavefunctions of the particles in this model , therefore , the model fails to describe saturation effects in the wavefunctions of the particles which become important at very high rapidities @xmath4 . in the language of loops , only the loops stretching over the rapidity interval greater than @xmath5 ( large  loops ) shown e.g. in fig .",
    "[ reggeon]b are included ( at leading - order accuracy and for @xmath6 ) .",
    "large  loops are created by matching the evolution ( pomeron  splittings ) of both particle s wavefunctions at @xmath5 . however , there are no loops inside the particle s wavefunctions ( small  loops ) where the pomeron  splits and merges , as shown e.g. in fig .",
    "[ reggeon]c(see , e.g. ref.@xcite ) , within the rapidity interval @xmath5 .",
    "the above limitations of the toy model are , of course , properties of the qcd dipole model  @xcite as well and are well - known .",
    "mueller s toy model breaks down at @xmath7 . in a later work mueller and salam",
    "@xcite did include saturation effects by imposing boost invariance on the small-@xmath8 evolution in a toy model , getting an expression for the @xmath2-matrix which is valid also for @xmath9 .",
    "the effect of saturation was an extension of the validity region of the result obtained for @xmath10 in  @xcite also to the region where @xmath9 .",
    "our toy model which is inspired by the new qcd evolution equations  mueller:2005ut , iancu:2005nj , kovner:2005nq , hatta:2005rn allows us to study unitarity effects as well as saturation effects in a more refined and systematic way .",
    "we calculate the leading order ( lo ) and the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) loop contributions to the particle - particle scattering amplitude .",
    "the lo result , which is the lo contribution of the large  loops , agrees with the results from  @xcite .",
    "our nlo result consisting of the nlo contribution of the large  loops and the lo contribution of the small  loops is new .",
    "the nlo correction with respect to the lo result is of order @xmath11 .",
    "this is the main result of the paper .",
    "it tells us that the nlo contribution is negligible as compared with the lo contribution up to rapidities @xmath12 .",
    "our lo result agrees with the result derived within mueller s toy model up to @xmath7 . beyond",
    "@xmath13 mueller s toy model fails to include saturation effects .",
    "the result in  @xcite which involves saturation effects is the same as our lo result until @xmath14 which is parametrically much larger than @xmath13 . however , beyond @xmath14 the nlo corrections become important which are not taken into account in mueller and salam s toy model  @xcite .",
    "presumably our toy model reveals the properties of the four - dimensional qcd evolution to some extent .",
    "in fact , its behavior is a heuristic sign that the nlo contribution can be neglected in the qcd evolution as well as long as @xmath15 .",
    "such a nlo correction seems to appear also in real qcd .",
    "considering the one - loop diagram for example , the lo contribution in qcd is @xmath16 which comes from varying the size of the loop from @xmath17 to @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "the nlo contribution @xmath20 comes from changing the location of a fixed zero - size loop from @xmath21 to @xmath18 .",
    "the suppression of the nlo contribution by the factor @xmath22 directly leads to the general correction @xmath23 ( the same happens in our toy model ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_the_toy_model ] , we show the toy model .",
    "two methods are developed in order to solve the toy model and some discussion is provided on the consequences of the nlo corrections .",
    "they are explained in sec .",
    "[ solution_tm ] . in the appendices we show the lorentz - invariance of the toy model and give the solution to another commonly used zero - dimensional model .",
    "finally , we discuss the results and give the conclusions .",
    "in this section , we consider a toy model without transverse dimensions which has a structure similar to that of the recently found four - dimensional qcd evolution equation  mueller:2005ut , iancu:2005nj , kovner:2005nq , hatta:2005rn .",
    "the toy model describes the rapidity evolution of the particle number @xmath24 of a system .",

    "( [ langevin ] ) is obvious : the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "represents the growing of the particles , the second term describes particle recombinations which limit the growth at a maximum occupancy , and the third term describes the particle number fluctuations .",

    "( [ langevin ] , [ h1 ] ) can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the solution to another widely discussed langevin equation is shown in appendix  other_langevin_equation .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) is quite complicated since @xmath36 is coupled with @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the evolution , i.e. , eq .",
    "( h1 ) is just a particular equation within an infinity hierarchy of coupled equations .",
    "however , the following observation helps to solve eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) : one can neglect the recombination term if one starts with a dilute object at the beginning of rapidity evolution , on the other hand , one can see that @xmath39 is an approximate fixed point of eq .",
    "( h1 ) in extremely high rapidity and @xmath40 limit .",
    "this will be more clear if one thinks about this in terms of the evolution equation of @xmath41(one can define @xmath42 . ) : @xmath43 \\ , $ ] in which it is easy to find @xmath44 . therefore ,",
    "if one starts with a dilute object at @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , then one can consider the evolution equation without the recombination term at the early stages of the evolution , and turn on the recombination term as a perturbation at the end of the evolution which forms the pomeron  loops .",
    "following this philosophy , we have found two different methods to solve eq .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) which we will present in the following subsections . before entering the calculations",
    ", we should state that we always work in a parametrical limit in which @xmath47 and @xmath48 , but @xmath49 is fixed and finite .",
    "( [ h1 ] ) without the recombination term , @xmath50 can be solved exactly if given some physically chosen initial conditions . in this paper",

( [ s ] ) is the usual bfkl term , and the second term corresponds to the one - loop diagram with the right intrinsic minus sign .",
    "one can also see that @xmath57 is the nlo contribution in the parametrical limit we mentioned above .    to get the lo two - loop diagram shown in fig .",

    "[ reggeon ]  b.    in order to calculate the nlo two - loop diagram shown in fig .",

    "( [ s ] ) after the inverse laplace transformation .",
