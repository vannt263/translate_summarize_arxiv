    "the dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) possess combined semiconducting and magnetic properties , hence their potential application in spintronics have been extensively investigated over past 30-years @xcite . a prototype dms used to explain a mechanism of the ferromagnetic order in this class of magnetic materials is ( ga , mn)as .",
    "it is a half - metal , with a metallic phase in majority - spin band , and with a spin - polarized hole introduced to the host gaas by a substitution of ga with mn .",
    "the nature of this hole rules magnetic and transport properties .",
    "therefore , deep understanding of a type and localization of empty states near the fermi level and within the energy gap is a subject of hot debate .    in the pioneering work ,",
    "dietl et al .",
    "@xcite assumed the extended - hole scenario , with a hdf delocalized within the valence band , and applied the p - d zener model to successfully explain high curie temperature , reaching 110  k , in gaas with 5@xmath0 of mn . since then , many papers based on this model have been written and very intensive ab - initio studies on the ( ga , mn)as system have been performed ( see a review @xcite ) .",
    "however , perfect consensus about this system is not achieved , and very low dopings were not studied in detail by means of first - principles methods , while there are many experimental papers considering this type of systems @xcite .",
    "it is also stated in a few works that some impurity states at low dopings appear within the energy gap .",
    "their character is believed to be of valence band origin and spin - polarized and the @xmath3-type .",
    "in contrast to those investigations , we have found that the gap states close to 1@xmath0 doping originate from the conduction band and their character is spin - unpolarized and the @xmath2-type .    in our studies , we have employed the following two additional methods beyond standard implementations of dft ( like gga ) , which have not been previously applied to the hole localization problem at very low concentrations :    1 .",
    "psic scheme @xcite , which corrects the electronic self - interaction problem for all atomic shells , giving a more balanced treatment than just the @xmath3-shell correlations included in the dft+u approach 2 .",
    "mlwfs analysis @xcite    these two methods complete the hdf localization description in the real - space manifold of localized functions centred at atoms or bonds .",
    "we have focused on two mn concentrations of 1@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 , showing that , at some co - doping with donors , the samples may exhibit different magnetic and conducting properties .",
    "next in the scope of this work , we have listed earlier studies on the hdf localization in ( ga , mn)as in section 2 , given details of our calculations in section 3 , presented our results in section 4 , and drawn conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the earlier dft and dft+u calculations for ( ga , mn)as at dopings of 6@xmath0 and 12@xmath0 already have shown that the highest contribution to the hdf originates from the as - neighbours of mn @xcite , and this result was confirmed in the system with 3@xmath0 of mn @xcite .",
    "further studies for concentrations 3 - 12@xmath0 showed that the hdf extends beyond the second as neighbours of the impurity @xcite .",
    "first application of the psic method to this system for dopings of 6 - 12@xmath0 presented the contribution of the 4@xmath4-mn states to the top of the valence band @xcite .",
    "other self - interaction corrected scheme , namely sic - lsd , has been applied to ( ga , mn)as at 3 - 25@xmath0 of mn , and only the majority - spin @xmath3-states have been treated with this method , beyond standard dft @xcite . that work , however , focuses on critical temperature and a comparison of ( ga , mn)as to mn doped gap and gan , showing the total density of states ( dos ) and the @xmath3-projected dos of mn only .",
    "the standard dft calculations for lower mn doping of 2@xmath0 have been also performed @xcite .",
    "none of the publications mention the gap states , since the considered dopings were too high to find them .",
    "those works did not focus on the chemical character of a hole , as it was considered in previous study @xcite for a different system : mn in ge .",
    "very detailed investigations of chemical character of the 3@xmath3-mn states in work @xcite do not consider explicitly a contribution of the 4@xmath4-mn states to the hdf .",
    "we found these states dominating over the t@xmath5-mn contribution when the psic scheme was applied .    nevertheless , all listed above publications agree about the hdf delocalization scenario , which leads to justification of the p - d zener model for t@xmath6 in ( ga , mn)as @xcite .",
    "our results presented here support this model too .",
    "recently , a contradicting hypothesis , with the fermi level localized within the 3@xmath3-mn impurity states , is discussed by the experimental group @xcite , and followed by a theoretical work @xcite with similar conclusions to earlier publication @xcite .",
    "these works examine the double - exchange mechanism as possible in ( ga , mn)as .    as for the gap states at lower dopings , some publications imply that the origin of these states is from the valence band and their spin - polarization is of the @xmath3-type @xcite .",
    "we have found that these states are spin - unpolarized and of the @xmath2-type , and they are formed by a separation from the conduction band .",
    "we have started performing the calculations within the density functional theory framework @xcite , employing the quantum espresso code @xcite , with the pseudopotentials ( pps ) and the plane - wave basis .",
    "for the exchange - correlation functional , we have chosen the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by means of the perdew - burk - erzenhof parametrization @xcite .",
    "we have used the ultrasoft pseudopotentials @xcite with the semicore 3@xmath2- and 3@xmath4-shell of mn and the 3@xmath3-shell of ga included in the valence bands , and with nonlinear core correction for the ga and the as pps .",
    "the energy cutoffs of 35 ry and 350 ry were set for the plane - waves and the density , respectively .",
    "the calculations were done for two mn concentrations : 1@xmath0 with one mn atom in the 216-atoms cell and 3@xmath0 with a single impurity in the 64-atoms cell .",
    "dense k - point grids of ( 6,6,6 ) and ( 12,12,12 ) points generated according to the monkhorst and pack scheme @xcite were used , for these dopings respectively . for a quadrature over the brillouin zone ,",
    "the metallic - smearing technique @xcite close to the fermi surface was used with the gaussian broadening of 0.01 ry .",
    "the experimental lattice constant of 5.65  @xmath7 was fixed for all calculations , and the atomic positions in the cells were optimized .",
    "the largest relaxation , found close to the mn impurity , was smaller than 0.6@xmath0 of the ga - as bond length .",
    "the psic scheme @xcite results were compared to the gga results .",
    "the self - interaction corrections have been applied to all atomic shells of all atoms in the calculated cells and to both spins .    to imagine a character of the hole",
    ", we performed the detailed analysis of the projected density of states onto the atomic shells .",
    "the hole occupation numbers @xmath8 were obtained from a quadrature of the projected dos , @xmath9 , in a range from the fermi level @xmath10 to the energy at which the dos vanish first time for the unoccupied states : @xmath11    the shape of hdf and the degree of localization in the real space have been examined using the maximally - localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) @xcite for which calculations are made with the aid of the wannier code @xcite .",
    "the electronic localization degree can be estimated from the mlwfs spreads , @xmath12 , defined as @xcite : @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 being the wannier function with number @xmath17 and centered in the original cell with the direct - lattice vector @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the real - space position operator .",
    "the sum of above defined quantities @xmath20 is minimized in the mlwfs - finding procedure @xcite .    to get a closer insight into the mn - as bonds , we calculated the mlwfs on the gga and the psic bloch - functions obtained for the 64-atoms cell .",
    "for minimization of the total spread , we have chosen the 133- and 128-band space in the spin up and down , respectively .",
    "bottom of the energy window was set within the gap between the localized 3@xmath3-ga derived bands and the delocalized @xmath21-bands of ( ga , mn)as . top of the energy window was fixed just above the 133-rd band counted for the spin up from the bottom of the energy window . from this band - manifold , we obtained 133 and 128 mlwfs in the spin up and down , respectively .    in analogy to the hole occupation numbers obtained from the dos , @xmath8 , we analyse contributions of the hdw from the mlwfs , @xmath22 , defined via the mlwfs occupations as @xmath23 .",
    "concept of the wannier occupations has been introduced recently for proper symmetries of some systems , which need a few unoccupied states ( usually the anti - bonding counterparts to the valence states ) in the manifold of bloch functions to be used for the mlwfs construction @xcite .",
    "these occupation numbers @xmath24 are defined with the use of two unitary transformation matrices @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where the first acts in the disentangling procedure to obtain the optimal subspace of bloch - like functions possessing proper symmetries and the second is obtained during the mlwfs optimization process .",
    "thus the occupation matrix is as follows : @xmath27 where win runs over all states in the outer window ( including some unoccupied states ) and occ runs over states up to the fermi level .",
    "since the off - diagonal occupations sum to zero in the whole system , we use only the diagonal occupations ( @xmath28 ) in the definition of mlwfs contributions to the hdf .",
    "the mn impurity , replacing ga in the gaas host , offers two electrons from the 4@xmath2-shell and five electrons from the 3@xmath3-shell instead of the ga configuration 4@xmath293@xmath304@xmath31 .",
    "since the valence of as is 5 and that of ga is 3 , the substitution of ga with mn creates a hole in the valence band , because five 3@xmath3 electrons of mn almost do not take a part in binding with the as neighbours .    in figure  [ dos ] ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) , projected on the t@xmath5 , e@xmath32 and 4@xmath4 mn - orbitals , is presented .",
    "the fermi level cuts through the valence band top , for two concentrations and both theoretical methods applied .",
    "the dos centre of mass , for the t@xmath5 and e@xmath32 states , moves in the psic scheme energetically downwards in comparison to the gga . also , the number of states at the fermi level decreases in the psic .",
    "these results are consistent with the previous psic @xcite and sic @xcite and the lda+u @xcite calculations .",
    "the e@xmath32-shell in spin up ( @xmath33 ) is fully occupied , and the t@xmath5 ( @xmath33 ) states are almost completely filled , with lwdin s occupation analysis @xcite giving range of values 2.74 - 2.85 . the spin - down ( @xmath34 ) states are quite empty for the mn-3@xmath3 states , with lwdin s occupations of 0.52 - 0.72 for the t@xmath5 .",

    "<S> the dilute magnetic semiconductor ( ga , mn)as is ferromagnetic in accordance with the p - d zener model . </S>",
    "<S> hole density function ( hdf ) localization has been previously studied by means of the density functional theory ( dft ) and non - standard dft methods ; however not for dopings near 1@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we have revised ( ga , mn)as using the dft with the pseudopotential self - interaction correction ( psic ) and maximally - localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) , which show the @xmath1 character of a hdf . nature of hdf is extended - for low dopings and the psic , 70@xmath0 of the hdf is located within the inter - impurities region , and contribution of the 3d - mn states is 3 - 5@xmath0 for 1 - 3@xmath0 of mn with the psic , and 11@xmath0 with the dft . </S>",
    "<S> we found that for dopings below 1@xmath0 , the spin - unpolarized @xmath2-type impurity states segregate from the conduction band to the energy gap - in contrast to earlier publications . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that donor co - doped dilute samples would be both insulating and nonmagnetic . </S>"
