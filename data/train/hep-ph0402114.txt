    "in the past few years , there has been much theoretical effort  @xcite to study the so called  zero - mode \"  @xcite contribution to the elastic and weak form factors for spin-0 and 1 systems in light - front dynamics(lfd ) . the zero - mode is closely related to the off - diagonal elements in the fock state expansion of the current matrix . in particular",
    ", the zero - mode contribution to the form factor @xmath6 can be characterized by the nonvanishing contribution from the off - diagonal elements in the @xmath7 limit , where @xmath8 is the longitudinal component of the momentum transfer @xmath9 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) . in the absence of zero - mode , however , the hadron form factors can be expressed as the convolution of the initial and final lf wave functions ; namely , the physical result can be obtained by taking into account only the valence contribution or the diagonal elements in the fock state expansion .    in this work",
    ", we analyze the zero - mode contribution to the elastic form factors of the @xmath0 meson using the lf constituent quark model ( or lfqm in short )  @xcite , which has been quite successful in predicting various electroweak properties of light and heavy mesons compared to the available data . in our previous lfd analysis  @xcite of spin-1 electromanetic form factors , we have shown that the zero - mode complication can exist even in the matrix element of the plus component of the current . using a covariant model of spin-1 system with the polarization vectors obtained from the lf gauge(@xmath12 ) , we found that only the helicity zero - to - zero amplitude , i.e. @xmath13 , can be contaminated by the zero - mode contribution .",
    "however , our conclusion in  @xcite was based on the use of a rather simple vector meson vertex @xmath14 .",
    "the aim of the present work is to explore our findings in the more phenomenologically accessible @xmath0 meson vertex(see eq .",

    "this includes the case of the @xmath0 meson vertex obtained by the melosh transformation frequently used in the lfqm .",
    "recently , jaus  @xcite proposed a covariant light - front approach that developes a way of including the zero - mode contribution and removing spurious form factors proportional to the lightlike vector @xmath15 . using the lfqm vector meson vertex that we include in this work , the author in  @xcite concluded the existence of a zero - mode in the form factor @xmath16 of a spin-1 meson .",
    "although his calculation was performed in a covariant way not using the helicity components , the form factor @xmath17 is related with the matrix element of @xmath18-component of the current(see eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) in  @xcite ) as well as @xmath13 component .",
