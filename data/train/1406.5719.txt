    "recently , quaternion - valued signal processing has been introduced to solve problems related to three or four - dimensional signals , such as vector - sensor array signal processing  @xcite , and wind profile prediction  @xcite . in many of the cases , the traditional complex - valued adaptive filtering operation needs to be extended to the quaternion domain to derive the corresponding adaptive algorithms . one key operation involved in derivation of quaternion - valued adaptive algorithms",
    "is the gradient operator .",
    "although there have been some derivations of this operator in literature with different level of details , it is still not fully clear how this operator can be derived in the most general case and how it can be applied to various signal processing problems .    in this work",
    ", we will give a general derivation of the quaternion - valued gradient operator and then implement this into two different applications .",
    "one case is to combine with the classic computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) approach in wind profile prediction .",
    "wind profile prediction is a classical signal prediction problem , and we can try to solve it using traditional linear and nonlinear ( neural networks ) prediction techniques .",
    "on the other hand , wind / atmospheric flow analysis is also a traditional problem in cfd , which employs conservation laws , various physical models and numerical methods to predict wind signals .",
    "it might be more accurate compared to other approaches , but not without disadvantages .",
    "for example , it is time - consuming with high computational complexity , and it also contains uncertainties / errors in initial / boundary conditions as well as models .",
    "therefore , we intend to combine the two approaches in a way that retains the efficiency of the former and the accuracy of the latter . as a preliminary study , we will apply a quaternion - valued linear predictor to the data generated by the cfd method to show the feasibility of the combined approach .",
    "another application of quaternion is the adaptive beamforming problem in vector sensor arrays .",
    "adaptive beamforming has been studied extensively in the past for traditional sensor array systems  @xcite . with the introduction of vector sensor arrays , such as those consisting of crossed - dipoles and tripoles ,",
    "adaptive beamforming has been extended to this area too  @xcite .",
    "a reference signal based adaptive beamformer will be set up employing the derived quaternion - valued least mean square ( lms ) algorithm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the general quaternion - valued gradient operator is derived and then applied to develop the quaternion - valued lms ( qlms ) as well as the augmented qlms ( aqlms ) algorithms in section [ sec : qlms and aqlms ] .",
    "application of the algorithms to the data generated by cfd is provided in section [ sec : cfd ] , and their application in adaptive beamforming is studied in section [ sec : vector_sensor ] .",
