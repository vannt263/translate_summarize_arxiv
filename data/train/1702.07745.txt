    "today s widespread incidences of cyber - attacks ( e.g. , most recently of the us democratic party and at companies such as sony , verizon , yahoo , target , jp morgan , office of personnel management , ashley madison ) , each more audacious than earlier ones , makes them perhaps the primary threat faced by individuals , organizations , and nations alike . consequences and implications of cyber - attacks include monetary losses , threats to critical infrastructure and national security , disruptions to daily life , a potential to cause loss of life and physical property , and data leaks exposing sensitive personal information about users and their activities .",
    "the largely quasi - static and unadaptable nature of existing cyber - defenses makes them vulnerable to rapidly evolving attack mechanisms , and thus engender not just a ` warning deficit ' but also a ` detection deficit ' , i.e. , an increase in the mean time between the time of an attack and its discovery .",
    "it has been well argued that , because news about an organization s compromise sometimes originates _ outside _ the organization , one could use open source indicators ( e.g. , news and social media ) as indicators of a cyber - attack . social media , in particular , turns users into social sensors empowering them to participate in an online ecosystem of event detection for happenings such as disease outbreaks  @xcite , civil unrest  @xcite , and earthquakes  @xcite . while the use of social media can not fully supplant the need for internal telemetry for certain types of attacks ( e.g. , use of network flow data to detect malicious network behavior  @xcite ) , analysis of such online media can provide insight into a broader range of cyber - attacks such as data breaches , account hijacking and newer ones as they emerge .    at the same time it is non - trivial to harness social media to identify cyber - attacks . *",
    "our objective is to detect a range of different cyber - attacks as early as possible , determine their characteristics ( e.g. , the target , the type of attack ) , in an unsupervised manner . *",
    "prior work ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) relies on weak supervision techniques which will be unable to capture the dynamically evolving nature of cyber - attacks over time and are also unable to encode characteristics of detected events , as we aim to do here .",
    "our main contributions are :    * * a framework for cybersecurity event detection based on online social media . *",
    "our dynamic event trigger expansion ( dete ) approach uses a limited , fixed , set of general seed event triggers and learns to map them to specific event - related expansions and thus provide situational awareness into cyber - events in an unsupervised manner . * * a novel query expansion strategy based on dependency tree patterns . * to model typical reporting structure in how cyber - attacks are described in social media ,",
    "we propose a dynamic event trigger expansion method based on convolution kernels and dependency parses .",
    "the proposed approach also employs a word embedding strategy to capture similarities between event triggers and candidate event reports . * * extensive empirical evaluation for three kinds of cyber - attacks*. we manually catalog ground truth for three event classes  distributed denial of service ( ddos ) attacks , data breaches , and account hijacking  and demonstrate that our approach consistently identifies and encodes events outperforming existing methods .",
    "the input to our methodology is a collection of time - ordered tweets @xmath0 organized along @xmath1 time slots .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the tweet space corresponding to a subcollection @xmath3 , let @xmath4 denote the target tweet subspace ( in our case , comprising cyber - attack events ) , and let @xmath5 denote the rest of the tweets in the considered tweet space .    * typed dependency query * : a * _ typed dependency query _ * is a linguistic structure that characterizes a semantically coherent event related topic .",
    "different from n - grams , terms contained in a * _ typed dependency query _ * share both syntactic and semantic relationships .",
    "mathematically , a * _ typed dependency query _ * is formulated as a tree structure @xmath6 , where node @xmath7 can be either a unigram , user mention , or a hashtag and @xmath8 represents a syntactic relation between two nodes .    * seed query * : a * _ seed query _ * is a manually selected typed dependency query targeted for a certain type of event .",
    "for instance , `` hacked account '' can be defined as a potential * _ seed query _ * for an account hijacking event .",
    "* expanded query * : an * _ expanded query _ * is a typed dependency query which is automatically generated by the dete algorithm based on a set of seed queries and a given tweet collection @xmath2 . * _ expanded query _ * and its seed query can be two different descriptions of the same subject . more commonly , an * _ expanded query _ * can be more specific than its seed query .",
    "for instance , `` prime minister dmitry medvedev twitter account hack '' , an expanded query from `` hacked account '' , denotes the message of an account hijacking event related with dmitry medvedev .",
    "* event representation * : an event @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the set of event - related expanded queries , @xmath12 denotes when the event happens , and @xmath13 refers to the category of the cyber - attack event ( i.e. , ddos , account hijacking , or data breach ) .",
    "here @xmath11 is a defined as a set because , in general , a cyber - attack event can be presented and retrieved by multiple query templates .",
    "for instance , among online discussion and report about event `` fashola s account , website hacked '' , the query template most used are `` fashola twitter account hack '' , `` fashola n78 m website twitter account hack '' and `` hack account '' .    given the above definitions , the major tasks underlying the cyber - attack event detection problem are defined as follows :    * task 1 : * * target domain generation : * given a tweet subcollection @xmath2 , * _ target domain generation _ * is the task of identifying the set of target related tweets @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath14 contains critical target related information based on which the expanded query can be mined .",
    "* task 2 : * * expanded query extraction : * given target domain @xmath14 , the task of * _ expanded query extraction _ * is to generate a set of expanded queries @xmath15 which represents the generic concept delivered by @xmath14 . thus set @xmath16 can be used to retrieve event related information from other collection sets .",
    "* task 3 : * * dynamic typed query expansion : * given a small set of seed queries @xmath17 and a twitter collection @xmath2 , the task of * _ dynamic typed query expansion _ * is to iteratively expand @xmath18 and @xmath19 until all the target related messages are included .",
    "in traditional information extraction ( ie ) , a large corpus of text must first be annotated to train extractors for event triggers , defined as main keywords indicating an event occurrence  @xcite . however , in our scenario using online social media , a manually annotated label set is impractical due to the huge volume of online media and the generally noisy characteristics of the text . in this section ,",
    "we propose a novel method to automatically mine query templates over which the event tracking is performed .      in this subsection",
    ", we propose the method of target domain generation , which serves as the source of social indicators for the detection of ongoing cyber - attack events . given a query and a collection of tweets @xmath2 , the typical way to retrieve query - related documentation is based on a bag of words model  @xcite which comes with its attendant disadvantages . consider the following two tweets : `` has riseups servers been compromised or * data leaked * ? '' and `` @o2 you completely screwed me over ! my phones back on , still * leaking data * and you are so unhelpful # cancellingcontract # bye '' . though the important indicator `` leak data '' for data breach attack is involved in both tweets , the second tweet is complaining about a phone carrier and is unexpected noise in our case . to address this problem ,",
    "syntactically bound information and semantic similarity constraints are jointly considered in our proposed method .    more specifically , each tweet in @xmath2 is first converted into its dependency tree form .",
    "thus for a given seed query @xmath20 , the target domain @xmath21 can be generated by collecting all tweets which are both syntactically and semantically similar to the seed query @xmath20 .",
    "mathematically , given two dependency trees @xmath20 and @xmath22 , a convolution tree kernel  @xcite is adopted to measure the similarity using shared longest common paths : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two nodes from two trees @xmath20 and @xmath22 respectively , @xmath26 represents set of positive real numbers , @xmath27 is the indicator function and @xmath28 counts the number of common paths between the two trees which peak at @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which can be calculated by an efficient algorithm proposed by kate et al .",
    "@xcite , as described in algorithm  [ alg : cpp ] .",
    "set @xmath29 set @xmath30 set @xmath31 @xmath32    in algorithm  [ alg : cpp ] , @xmath33 is the number of common paths between the two trees which originate from @xmath25 and @xmath24 , and can be recursively defined as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the set of children node . in both algorithm  [ alg : cpp ] and equation  [ equ : cdp ] , we use the semantic similarity operator @xmath36 , introduced to consider the semantic similarity of tree structre .",
    "this semantic similarity is computed by considering cosine similarity of word embeddings vector generated from the word2vec algorithm .",
    "this model considers the common paths which are linguistically meaningful , which reduces the noise introduced by coincidentally matched word chains .",
    "in addition , long - range dependencies between words , which decreases the performance , are avoided because functionally related words are always directly linked in a dependency tree .      in this subsection",
    ", we propose a way to dynamically mine an expanded query given a small collect of seed query , as shown in table  [ tab : seedquery ] . by providing a small set of seed queries ( unigrams ) , zhao et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a dynamic query expansion ( dqe ) method which is able to iteratively expand the seed query set from currently selected target tweet subspace until convergence . looking beyond the simple unigrams based expansion , by introducing dependency - based tree structure extraction",
    ", we build a dynamic expanded query generation model for the cyber - attack detection task .    .seed",
    "queries for cyber - attack events . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     0.40     0.58           we comprehensively show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dqestreamgraph2014 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dqestreamgraph2016 ] , the wide range of events that our system is able to detect .",
    "notice , the clear burst in twitter activity that our query expansion algorithm is able to pick . through the following case studies we highlight some of the interesting cases for each of three cyber attack types , that our system detected .",
    "* targeted ddos attacks on sony and dyn * : in late , november 2014 , a hacker group calling itself `` the guardians of peace '' hacked their way into sony pictures , leaving the sony network crippled for days , allegedly perpertrated by north korea .",
    "we capture 12 separate events of ddos attacks including four in last week of august 2014 , starting with the first on august 24th . further in 2015 , more ensuing attacks are captured one highlighted by the data breach of their movie production house , on december 12th and then a massively crippling targeted , ddos attack on their playstation network in late december , 2015 .",
    "another noteworthy case of ddos attacks in 2016 , is the multiple distributed denial - of - service attack on dns provider `` dyn '' from october 21st through 31st in 2016 , that almost caused an worldwide internet outage .",
    "our system detects generates several query expansions , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dyndns ] which clearly characterizes the nature of these ddos attacks where the hackers turned a large number of internet - connected devices around the world in to botnets executing a distributed attack .    *",
    "ashley madison website data breach : * in july 2015 , a group calling itself `` the impact team '' stole the user data of ashley madison , an adult dating website billed as enabling extramarital affairs .",
    "the hackers stole the website all customer data and threatened to release the personally identifying information if the site was not immediately shut down . on 18 and 20",
    "august , the group leaked more than 25 gigabytes of company data , including user details .",
    "we are able to detect this data breach on july 20 , 2015 .",
    "the word clouds in fig .",
    "[ fig : ashleymadison ] clearly show how our method iteratively expands from the seed queries to the expanded queries in the last , iteration 3 capturing a very rich semantic aspect of the breach .",
    "after the initial burst as seen in the figure , we also see a second corresponding burst a month later , on august 20 when the user data is released anot now the top query expansion captured characterized by the mentions of user data leak of the same website .",
    "* twitter account hijackings * : we were also able to detect with very high date accuracy , several high profile cases of account hijackings of social media accounts of known personalities and government institutions including the twitter account for u.s .",
    "central command which was hacked by isis sympathizers on january 12 , 2015 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : uscentcom ] that our method not only identifies the victim ( `` central command twitter account hack '' ) but also the actor who perpetrated the hacking ( `` isis hack twitter account '' ) .",
    "[ sub : case_studies ]",
    "* cyberattack detection and characterization . * detecting and characterizing cyber attacks is highly challenging due to the constant - involving nature of cyber criminals .",
    "recent proposals cover a large range of different methods , and table  [ tab : related_work ] lists representative works in this space .",
    "earlier work primarily focuses on mining network traffic data for intrusion detection .",
    "specific techniques range from classifying malicious network flows  @xcite to anomaly detection in graphs to detect malicious servers and connections  @xcite .",
    "more recently , researchers seek to move ahead to predict cyber attacks before they happened for early notifications  @xcite . for example , liu et al .  leverage various network data associated to an organization to look for indicators of attacks  @xcite . by extracting signals from mis - configured dns and bgp networks as well as spam and phishing activities ,",
    "they build classifiers to predict if an organization is ( or will be ) under attack . similarly , soska et al .",
    "apply supervised classifiers to network traffic data to detect vulnerable websites , and predict their chances of turning malicious in the future  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", online media such as blogs and social networks become another promising data source of security intelligence  @xcite .",
    "most existing work focuses on technology blogs and tweets from _ security professionals _ to extract useful information  @xcite .",
    "for example , liao et al .  builds text mining tools to extract key attack identifiers ( ip , md5 hashes ) from security tech blogs  @xcite .",
    "sabottke et al .",
    "leverage twitter data to estimate the level of interest in existing cve vulnerabilities , and predict their chance of being exploited in practice  @xcite .",
    "our work differs from existing literature since we focus on crowdsourced data from the much broader user populations who are likely the _ victims _ of security attacks .",
    "the most related work to ours is  @xcite which uses weakly supervised learning to detect security related tweets .",
    "however , this technique is unable to capture the dynamically evolving nature of attacks and is unable to encode characteristics of detected events .",
    "* event extraction and forecasting on twitter . * another body of related work focuses on twitter to extract various events such as trending news  @xcite , natural disasters  @xcite , criminal incidents  @xcite and population migrations  @xcite .",
    "common event extraction methods include simple keyword matching and clustering , and topic modeling with temporal and geolocation constrains  @xcite .",
    "event forecasting , on the other hand , aims to predict future evens based on early signals extracted from tweets .",
    "example applications include detecting activity planning  @xcite and forecasting future events such as civil unrest  @xcite and upcoming threats to national airports  @xcite . in our work ,",
    "we follow a similar intuition to detect signals for major security attacks .",
    "the key novelty in our approach , different from these works , is the need for a typed query expansion strategy that provides both focused results and aids in extracting key indicators underlying the cyber - attack .",

    "we have demonstrated an unsupervised approach to extract and encode cyber - attacks reported and discussed in social media .",
    "we have motivated the need for a careful template - driven query expansion strategy , and how the use of dependency parse trees and word embeddings supports event extraction . given",
    "the widespread prevalence of cyber - attacks , tools such as presented here are crucial to providing situational awareness on an ongoing basis .",
    "future work is aimed at broadening the class of attacks that the system is geared to as well as at modeling sequential dependencies in cyber - attacks .",
