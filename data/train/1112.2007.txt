    "low - energy anti - neutrinos from nuclear reactors are well suited to determine the neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 , which is important for the search of cp violation in the leptonic sector ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the double - chooz  @xcite , daya bay  @xcite , and reno collaborations  @xcite are aiming to measure @xmath2 with very high precision with the use of @xmath3 s produced in nuclear reactors . the present upper bound to this quantity reported by the chooz  @xcite and minos  @xcite collaborations is : @xmath4 .",
    "the double - chooz , daya bay and reno experiments monitor the inverse beta - decay reaction on a hydrogen target |_e + p e^+ + n [ dcdb ] [ eq : reaction ] for a known anti - neutrino energy flux .",
    "the positron yield is measured as a function of the positron energy .",
    "an accurate extraction of the mixing angle @xmath2 from an analysis of the measured positron yield requires a precise knowledge of the radiative corrections ( rcs ) . in earlier papers  @xcite",
    ", the relevant rcs were evaluated in the theoretical framework developed by sirlin and marciano  @xcite . in this framework , to be referred to as the s - m approach , the rcs of order @xmath1 are decomposed into so - called outer and inner corrections .",
    "the outer correction is a universal function of the lepton energy and is independent of the details of hadron physics , whereas the inner correction is influenced by short - distance physics and the hadron structure .",
    "the inner corrections coming from @xmath5 and weak - boson loop diagrams are divided into high - momentum and low - momentum parts .",
    "the former is evaluated in the current - quark picture , while the latter is computed with the use of the phenomenological electroweak - interaction form factors of the nucleon .",
    "although the estimates of inner corrections in the s - m formalism are considered to be reliable to the level of accuracy quoted in the literature , the possibility that these estimates may involve some degree of model dependence is not totally excluded .",
    "we present here a calculation of the rcs to order @xmath1 based on effective field theory ( eft ) .",
    "we use heavy - baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath6pt ) , which is an effective low - energy theory of qcd , see e.g. ref  @xcite . in hb@xmath6pt",
    "the short distance hadronic and electroweak processes are subsumed into a well - defined set of _ low - energy constants _ ( lecs ) .",
    "in other words , these lecs systematically parameterize the inner corrections of the s - m approach .",
    "therefore , insofar as there are enough sources of information to determine the values of these lecs , hb@xmath6pt leads to model - independent results with systematic estimates of higher - order corrections .",
    "the use of hb@xmath6pt to calculate electroweak transition amplitudes for the nucleon and few - nucleon systems were pioneered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and subsequently there have been many important developments . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we presented the first ever eft - based calculation of rcs for the neutron @xmath7-decay process , @xmath8 .",
    "because in hb@xmath6pt the nucleons are treated as point - like , it is expected on general grounds that the order-@xmath1 rcs are common between neutron @xmath7-decay and inverse @xmath7-decay .",
    "meanwhile , it should be mentioned that , in the counting scheme adopted here and in ref.@xcite , the order-@xmath1 rcs are of the same order as the @xmath9 nucleon - recoil corrections including the  weak magnetism \" contributions , and hence a consistent eft calculation should include these recoil corrections simultaneously .",
    "we present here such an eft calculation , taking advantage of the fact that the @xmath9-expansion is a natural part of our counting scheme and thus dictates how to incorporate recoil corrections order by order ( see later in the text ) .",
    "since exactly the same lecs are involved in the eft calculations of inverse @xmath7-decay and neutron @xmath7-decay , we can in principle use the existing neutron @xmath7-decay data to determine those lecs and make a model - independent estimation of rcs for the inverse @xmath7-decay , the @xmath9 recoil corrections are properly taken into account . in this connection , we note that an attempt has been made in the literature  @xcite to directly relate the neutron decay rate with the inverse @xmath7-decay cross section , assuming that the order-@xmath1 corrections ( rcs and recoil corrections combined ) are common between these processes .",
    "as mentioned , this assumption is justified as far as the genuine rcs of order @xmath1 is concerned .",
    "however , as described later in the text , our calculation shows differences between the @xmath9 corrections for inverse @xmath7-decay , eq .",
