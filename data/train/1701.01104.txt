    "modeling physical phenomena via the coupling of two - level systems ( qubits ) to quantized harmonic oscillators has historically been of great interest in diverse fields ranging from quantum optics @xcite and solid - state physics @xcite to quantum biology @xcite .",
    "this approach has become frequent in modern physics since fully quantum - mechanical descriptions may reveal phenomena not covered by classical or semiclassical approaches .",
    "as well - known examples , one has the study of dissipation and decoherence of a qubit via the spin - boson model @xcite or the presence of collapses and revivals of the atomic population inversion in the atom - field interaction @xcite .    for the latter case ,",
    "the simplest quantum description is given by the exactly solvable jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model @xcite , which considers a two - level atom weakly coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field .",
    "usually , the  energy non - conserving terms in the atom - field interaction hamiltonian are neglected through the so - called rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) .",
    "however , the use of the rwa in this problem may not describe dynamical properties of the model correctly when the atom - field interaction becomes sufficiently strong @xcite .",
    "other studies have addressed the limitations of the rwa in diverse configurations @xcite .",
    "only recently it has been shown that the non - rwa atom - field hamiltonian possesses a symmetry rendering the model integrable @xcite . however , due to the lack of closed form expressions for the eigenstates , one usually has to appeal to different effective approaches to treat the problem without the rwa .",
    "this includes the use perturbation series for path - integrals @xcite or particular regimes such as far - from - resonance cases ( dispersive limit ) @xcite .",
    "recently , the fabrication of artificial atoms with superconducting circuits @xcite has favored the control of qubit - oscillator interactions , and thus regimes where the rwa breaks down can be explored experimentally . in circuit",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( circuit qed ) a qubit or two - level system can be produced , for instance , by using a thin insulator between two superconducting materials [ josephson junction ( jj ) ] , and controlling either the number of cooper pairs that tunnel from one side to the other ( charge qubit ) or the phase of their wavefunctions ( phase qubit ) .",
    "also , by adding one or more jj in a superconducting loop [ superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) ] , a qubit can be produced by controlling the external magnetic flux through the squid ( flux qubit ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a quantum harmonic oscillator naturally represents a single electromagnetic mode trapped in a transmission line @xcite .    giving all these developments in the control of simple systems consisting of qubits and bosonic modes ,",
    "it is natural to search for configurations which allow us to further understand the limits of the usually taken rwa .",
    "we explore the validity of the rwa in a setup comprised of two identical qubit - oscillator systems that are coupled through their harmonic coordinates .",
    "this setup is amenable to implementation in superconducting circuits as discussed in @xcite , where non - markovian features are discussed within the rwa .",
    "the present work is organized as follows .",
    "we analytically diagonalize the full non - rwa hamiltonian in ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : diag ] ) and then solve the master equation which includes dephasing for the qubits ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : dyn ] ) .",
    "predictions contrasting our full treatment with the rwa model in @xcite are then presented , in particular for the two - qubit subsystem for which purity ( sec .",
    "[ subsec : pur ] ) and entanglement dynamics ( sec .  [ subsec : ent ] ) are investigated . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in this work , we are interested in the setup depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "it consists of two groups of subsystems ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) , each comprising a qubit and a bosonic mode .",
    "these groups will interact through the modes . inside each group ,",
    "the local interaction takes the usual spin - boson form with no transverse field ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 are the pauli matrices for the qubits ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the corresponding bosonic modes , @xmath7 is a coupling constant , and @xmath8 is the identity operator acting on the corresponding qubit state space . the @xmath9-terms naturally appear in some circuit qed architectures when working out of the so - called degeneracy point @xcite , so that , for completeness , they are included here .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "( color online ) two subsystems @xmath10 and @xmath11 , each formed by a qubit and a bosonic mode , interact through the modes ( coupling strength @xmath12 ) .",
    "each qubit is also subjected to dephasing at rate @xmath13 . inside each subsystem , the qubit and the mode interact with each other ( coupling strength @xmath7 ) . ]",
    "the total energy of the full setup reads @xmath14 with the free hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the resonance frequency of the qubits and @xmath17 is the angular frequency of the modes .",
    "the index @xmath18 defines the form of the interaction mechanism between the modes which can be either @xmath19 or @xmath20 with @xmath12 being a coupling constant . in the first approach ( @xmath21 ) , the spatial coordinates of each oscillator are coupled in a kind of quadrature - quadrature form . in circuit qed , this can be induced by coupling the two transmission lines to an auxiliary qubit that mediates a geometric second - order interaction @xcite , while in cavity qed this can be done by placing a partially reflecting mirror between two optical cavities @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the second approach ( @xmath22 ) arises from the rwa performed on @xmath23 so that its oscillating terms are neglected in the interaction picture . for the interaction of a two - level atom with an electromagnetic mode , which in the rwa gives rise to the jc hamiltonian",
    ", one can only compare the rwa and non - rwa hamiltonians through successive approximations or numerics . here",
    ", we will be able to perform such investigation in a fully analytic manner by exactly solving @xmath24+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\left(\\sigma_{z_a}\\rho_j\\sigma_{z_a}+\\sigma_{z_b}\\rho_j\\sigma_{z_b}-2\\rho_j\\right ) , \\label{eq : msteq}\\ ] ] for initial states of interest . in eq.([eq :",
    "msteq ] ) , @xmath13 is the rate of pure dephasing caused by independent markovian baths acting on the qubits .",
    "this is by far the most relevant noise when working outside the degeneracy point @xcite .",
    "energy relaxation of qubits or the transmission lines ( bosonic modes ) , as well as dephasing on the latter , can be made negligible compared to dephasing in the qubits @xcite .",
    "these experimental facts provide us a backgound to leave aside noise mechanisms besides qubit dephasing as a first approximation .",
    "this is especially convenient in our case because our goal is to provide analytical expressions that evidence inadequacy of the rwa in certain regimes .",
    "those neglected noise mechanisms would render the problem unsuitable to analytic treatment and can be numerically investigated elsewhere .",
    "in order to analytically solve eq . , we start by diagonalizing the hamiltonians @xmath25 .",
    "this is achieved by the unitary transformation @xmath26 given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the displacement operator with @xmath29 , @xmath30 corresponds to a beam - splitter operation , @xmath31 is a squeezing operator with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is a polaron transformation @xcite and @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the operation @xmath36 reduces to the identity for @xmath22 .",
    "this is so because this transformation is responsible for the elimination of terms with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , not present in eq .  .",
    "it is important to realize that the application of @xmath39 requires @xmath40 , so that the frequencies of the normal modes are real numbers .",
    "values of @xmath12 close to such limit have been associated to quantum chaos in nonlinear oscillators @xcite .    with the help of these transformations ,",
    "we obtain the diagonal hamiltonian @xmath41 that reads @xmath42 with shifted qubit frequencies @xmath43 and normal mode frequencies @xmath44 the hamiltonian ( [ eq : diaghj ] ) is an interesting physical result .",
    "it implies that , in spite of the model ( @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) , the modes decouple from the qubits , and the latter interact through an ising - type hamiltonian with @xmath45 for uncoupled modes ( @xmath46 ) , no effective coupling between the qubits is observed ( @xmath47 ) . for finite @xmath12 , we can already spot the fundamental differences in the non - rwa ( @xmath21 ) and rwa ( @xmath22 ) descriptions . this can be seen from the plots in fig .",

    ", they have not yet been traced out .",
    "what happens is that they are _ frozen _ in this interaction picture and were completely decoupled from the qubits due to the transformation @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , we can solve eq .   in the qubits subspace and tensor the result with the initial state of the modes .",
    "the transformations back to the original picture will then restore the time evolution of the whole system , entangling modes and qubits . by denoting @xmath57 as just @xmath58",
    ", we then solve eq .   in the standard basis @xmath59 , in which @xmath60 stands for the excited ( ground ) state of a single qubit . in our case , we do not have to move the system state entirely back to the original picture because we are interested in the dynamics of the qubits .",
    "the polaron operation @xmath61 is the only one required as the other unitary transformations employed to diagonalize eq .",

    "more important to us , they both depend on the whole density matrix and not only on its diagonal elements",
    ". quantities such as occupation probabilities of the bare states would depend only on diagonal density matrix elements .",
    "for all these reasons , entropy and entanglement are then very good candidates to spot the differences between the full model and its rwa version .",
    "we consider the qubits to be initially prepared in the eigenstate of the pauli matrix @xmath63 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 on the other hand , the modes are initially set in the product of coherent states , @xmath66 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are complex amplitudes , and @xmath67 is the two - mode fock state . solving eq .   for the initial state @xmath68 and using eq .",

    "explicit expressions for @xmath76 and details about @xmath77 can be found in the appendix .",
    "in general , quantum information processing requires that pure states , like superposition states , remain pure during time evolution .",

    "evidently , the purity is maximum at @xmath90 as the initial state of the qubits is @xmath91 and not entangled with the modes .",
    "the first thing to be noticed is that there is a clear competition between the markovian dynamics induced by the dephasing baths and the non - markovian dynamics induced by the mode - mode interaction @xcite . to be more precise ,",
    "the oscillations appear as the result of the latter while the envelop ( purity damping ) is caused by the baths .",

    "purities for both the complete and the rwa models turned out to be independent on the initial coherent states of the modes .",
    "this is so because @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be eliminated from the dynamics via a time - independent unitary transformation on the modes ( basis transformation ) .",
    "let us now closely examine the dependence of the two - qubit purity on mode - mode coupling strength @xmath12 . from fig .",
    "[ fg : purab ] , we can see that , for moderate couplings ( @xmath94 ) , the predictions of the rwa and non - rwa models already disagree considerably .",
    "although they both have similar orders of magnitude , the oscillations are not in phase anymore ( compared to small @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the deviations in @xmath50 caused essentially by the squeezing parameter @xmath95 .",
    "in addition , as @xmath12 becomes larger ( approaching the limit @xmath96 ) , the rwa model fails miserably to predict the correct phases and amplitudes .",
    "it is noticeable that in the full non - rwa model the amplitude of purity oscillation is much larger than the rwa prediction .",
    "this can be attributed to content of the square brackets in eq .  .",

    "we now turn our analysis to the two - qubit entanglement generation in the studied setup .",
    "some quantum information tasks , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , need the handling of large amounts of entanglement to be performed properly , so that it is essential to determine how entangled a certain system is . in this work ,",
    "we use the concept of entanglement of formation of an arbitrary two - qubit mixed state @xcite .",
    "first , one defines the so - called concurrence function @xmath103 , where @xmath104s are the eigenvalues in decreasing order of @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the complex conjugate of @xmath78 , and @xmath107 the @xmath108-pauli matrix .",
    "then , the entanglement of formation of @xmath78 can be defined as @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "both concurrence and entanglement of formation are equal to zero ( unity ) for a separable ( maximally entangled ) state .",
    "figure  [ fg : entab ] compares the dynamics of @xmath111 $ ] for different values of qubit dephasing rates @xmath13 and mode coupling strengths @xmath12 .",
    "as expected , @xmath112 starts from zero as the initial state is separable .",
    "then @xmath112 oscillates and reaches its maximum values for the conditions taken in the uppermost panels ( @xmath113 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the state of the two - qubit system periodically changes from separable to maximally entangled states in the absence of dephasing . in the bottom panels , on the other hand , such oscillations are damped due to the non - null dephasing rate ( @xmath114 ) , and the capability of producing higher peaks of @xmath112 is enhanced in the strong coupling regime .",
    "thus , the non - markovian aspect of the dynamics acts as an entanglement generator , whereas the markovian part tends to destroy it over long times .",
    "another feature present in fig .",
    "[ fg : entab ] is that the frequency of oscillation of @xmath112 increases with @xmath12 , independently of the model .",
    "however , for the full model , the generation of entanglement is evidently faster than in the rwa .",
    "this might be interesting for a scenario where entanglement needs to be preserved in the presence of strong dephasing .",
    "fast generation of entanglement has recently attracted interest of the community and has already been proposed in other setups @xcite .    as a final and important remark for the purposes of this work",
    ", the appearing of maximal entanglement takes longer times than time span considered in the plots of purity in fig .",
    "[ fg : purab ] .",
    "since what justifies the rwa is precisely first order perturbation theory @xcite , valid for short times , we expect the rwa to fail already for weak values of the coupling constant @xmath12 .",
    "this failure is evident in the plots in fig .",
    "[ fg : entab ] .",
    "we have provided an illustrative example where the inadequacy of the rwa for strong couplings or long times can be analytically investigated .",
    "the system is composed of quantum two - level systems and harmonic oscillators , both ubiquitous in controlled quantum systems such as trapped ions or circuit qed .",
    "in particular , we have focused on a model comprised of two qubit - mode subsystems which are brought into interaction through their harmonic coordinates .",
    "we have performed exact diagonalization of the full model and its rwa version , and analytically solved the master equation for initial states of interest .",
    "we then have shown that the modes coupling strength @xmath12 plays a fundamental role on the variety of responses of the qubits as displayed by state purity and entanglement .",
    "the predictions of the complete model and the rwa model for short times and small @xmath12 agree well .",
    "however , even for short times , as soon as @xmath12 increases , the rwa starts to fail .",
    "this was clearly spotted by purity dynamics . at longer times , when two - qubit entanglement is fully generated , the rwa fails even for small @xmath12 .",
    "our study also showed that , the stronger the modes are coupled , the larger the reduction of the degree of purity at short time scale and the faster generation of entanglement .",
    "moreover , we verified the competition between markovian dephasing on the qubits and non - markovianity induced by the modes coupling constant in conformity with ref .",
