    "lithium was created in the big bang at a concentration of about 0.5 parts per billion @xcite . since then , many of the universe s li nuclei have been destroyed in nuclear burning because li is susceptible to proton capture at relatively low temperatures ( @xmath3  k ) .",
    "li burning occurs in the centers of stars , but their surfaces are cool enough to preserve li .",
    "therefore , li is observable only in stars with outer envelopes that have never been fully mixed down to high temperatures .",
    "the atmospheres of most old , metal - poor stars on the main sequence display the same amount of li @xcite .",
    "this value , @xmath4 , is called the spite plateau . , where @xmath5 is the number density of li atoms and @xmath6 is the number density of h atoms .",
    "] however , the plateau is significantly below the primordial value , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "although the factor of 24 drop in li abundance from the primordial value to the spite plateau has been attributed to atomic diffusion and turbulent transport below the convection zone on the main sequence @xcite and convective overshoot on the pre - main sequence @xcite , models of rotationally induced mixing ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) offer an explanation with less fine tuning .",
    "@xcite showed that calibrating mixing parameters to the sun also explains li depletion in other stars , including the mean and dispersion of the li abundance on the spite plateau .",
    "in addition , the rotation models also explain the behavior of other light elements , like be and b @xcite .    in metal - rich stars , mixing more efficiently depletes surface lithium than in metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , novae can generate li for metal - rich , population  i stars @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the spite plateau breaks down at @xmath8 } \\gtrsim -1.2 $ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the constancy of li on the spite plateau makes li anomalies in metal - poor stars readily apparent .",
    "for example , some carbon - rich stars show deficiencies in li that can be explained by mass transfer from a binary , li - depleted companion @xcite .    however , it is more difficult to explain stars that are anomalous for being _ enhanced _ in li .",
    "this is especially true for giant stars .",
    "stars at the main sequence turn - off experience a rapid drop in li abundance @xcite .",
    "as a low - mass star evolves on to the red giant branch ( rgb ) , its surface convection zone deepens enough to dredge up material that has been processed through nuclear fusion , including li burning . although those regions are no longer hot enough to burn li , they were once hot enough to do so",
    ". hence , the dredge - up brings up li - depleted material while li on the surface is subducted into the star .",
    "the dredge - up dilutes the surface li abundance to 510% of its original value .",
    "models of dilution caused by the dredge - up @xcite explain the surface abundance of li as a function of the subgiant s increasing luminosity or decreasing temperature .",
    "when the star reaches a luminosity of @xmath9 , the hydrogen - burning shell expands beyond the molecular weight boundary established by the first dredge - up @xcite .",
    "`` extra '' mixing  possibly thermohaline mixing @xcite  beyond the canonical stellar model changes the surface composition for stars at the rgb bump .",
    "this mixing rapidly destroys any li remaining in the red giant s atmosphere .",
    "nonetheless , some giants are li - rich ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested a mechanism ( the `` cameron  fowler conveyor '' ) for producing excess li in the atmospheres of giant stars .",
    "the central nuclear processes for the conveyor comprise the @xmath10-ii chain of hydrogen burning .",
    "@xmath11    reaction  [ eq : ppii ] is very active ( compared to the @xmath10-i chain ) at temperatures around @xmath12  k. li destruction , reaction  [ eq : li ] , is very efficient at @xmath13  k. hence , @xmath14 will be destroyed as soon as it is created in reaction  [ eq : be ] unless @xmath15 can be brought to cooler temperatures before it captures an electron .",
    "although the half - life for reaction  [ eq : be ] is 53 days under terrestrial conditions , @xcite theorized that the scarcity of bound k - shell electrons available for reaction  [ eq : be ] at @xmath16  k , where @xmath15 is almost entirely ionized , extends the half - life to 50100 years .",
    "the mixing that accompanies thermal pulses in intermediate - mass stars on the second - ascent asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) is deep enough to reach the @xmath10-ii burning zone . as a result , the cameron ",
    "fowler conveyor is a plausible explanation for li - rich agb stars in the mass range 47  @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in fact , li - rich agb stars are not uncommon @xcite",
    ". however , the convective envelopes of first - ascent rgb stars and less massive agb stars are not deep enough to activate the conveyor .",
    "any excess li in rgb stars must be a result of processes outside of `` standard '' stellar evolution of single stars with ordinary rotation rates .",
    "@xcite called this non - standard phenomenon extra deep mixing combined with `` cool bottom processing . ''",
    "the mechanism for the mixing remains elusive .",
    "nonetheless , li - rich red giants do exist .",
    "@xcite discovered a luminous red giant with @xmath18 in the globular cluster ( gc ) m3 .",
    "the star is unremarkable except for having over 1000 times more li than it should have , based on its position on the rgb .",
    "other gcs with li - rich giants include m5 ( in a post - agb cepheid , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ngc  362 @xcite , and m68 @xcite . @xcite and @xcite found over a dozen li - rich field k giants around solar metallicity .",
    "they also found tentative evidence for clustering of li - rich giants around the red clump , or horizontal branch ( hb ) , where stars burn helium in their cores after the he core flash at the tip of the rgb . the idea that the he core flash could activate the cameron ",
    "fowler conveyor was bolstered by @xcite s ( @xcite ) discovery of a li - rich hb star whose he core burning was confirmed by asteroseismological measurements from the kepler spacecraft @xcite .",
    "@xcite also discovered a li - rich , hb star in the open cluster trumpler  5 , and @xcite found a li - rich giant in the open cluster ngc  6819 that is too faint to be on the hb or agb .",
    "this star is particularly interesting for showing asteroseismic anomalies that could indicate rotationally induced mixing , which in turn could generate li ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , @xcite found that the star is rotating rapidly for a red giant , but puzzlingly , they did not find any additional evidence for deep mixing .",
    "metal - rich stars can have a complicated evolution of li , as illustrated by the @xmath19  dex scatter in li abundance  even at fixed effective temperature  in @xcite s ( @xcite ) survey of lithium in open clusters .",
    "surveys for li enhancement among metal - poor stars can be easier to interpret .",
    "inspired by @xcite s ( @xcite ) discovery of a li - rich giant in a metal - poor gc , @xcite surveyed 261 giants in four metal - poor gcs , but they found no li - rich giants .",
    "therefore , the frequency of li - rich red giants in gcs is less than 0.4% .",
    "@xcite also surveyed red giants in gcs and found one li - rich giant out of about 350 giants , corresponding to a li - rich frequency of @xmath20 .",
    "@xcite searched for li - rich giants in the milky way ( mw ) halo in the radial velocity experiment ( rave , * ? ? ?",
    "they found eight li - rich giants out of 700 metal - poor field giants .",
    "they also found one li - rich giant in the gc m68 . @xcite and @xcite also found 15 li - rich giants in mw dwarf satellite galaxies .",
    "however , the mw field and dwarf galaxies are not amenable to easily distinguishing between the agb and upper rgb .",
    "in fact , many of the li - rich giants discovered by @xcite and @xcite could be agb stars .    explanations for li - rich rgb stars fall into three categories : engulfment of a substellar companion , self - generation , and mass transfer . in the engulfment scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a red giant expands into the orbit of a rocky planet , a hot jupiter , or a companion brown dwarf .",
    "the destroyed companion could potentially enrich the star with li and other volatile elements that concentrate in planets @xcite .",
    "even if the engulfed companion does not donate li to its host star , it would provide angular momentum . the resulting increase in rotation rate",
    "could itself inspire deep mixing that activates the cameron ",
    "fowler conveyor @xcite .    in the self - generation scenario , stars can experience deep mixing events that dredge li to the stellar surface , where it is observable .",
    "rotationally induced mixing is one example . indeed , some li - rich giants are rapid rotators @xcite , but others are not @xcite . other possible causes are mixing at the rgb luminosity function bump @xcite or deep mixing inspired by he core flashes at the tip of the rgb or on the hb @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite found a li - rich giant in the gc ngc  362 that may be either at the rgb bump ( hydrogen shell burning ) or on the red clump ( helium core burning ) . on the other hand , @xcite s ( @xcite )",
    "li - rich giant in ngc  6819 is one counter - example below the rgb bump .",
    "the chemical analysis of that star by @xcite found no evidence for deep mixing in any element other than li .",
    "furthermore , most deep mixing scenarios predict that the li - rich giants would cluster at a specific evolutionary phase ( luminosity )",
    ". however , @xcite found no luminosity clustering of li - rich red giants .",
    "finally , stars can alter their surface compositions through binary mass transfer .",
    "agb stars are known to generate carbon and neutron - capture elements , like barium @xcite .",
    "hence , binary companions to agb stars or former agb stars can be enhanced in those elements @xcite .",
    "intermediate - mass agb stars can also dredge up li in the cameron ",
    "fowler conveyor .",
    "even less massive agb stars might be able to generate li with the help of thermohaline mixing @xcite .",
    "if the star transferred mass to a companion during a phase of li dredge - up , then that companion would be enhanced in li .",
    "this is a possible explanation for a li - rich turn - off star in the gc ngc  6397 @xcite .",
    "that star will remain enhanced in li until the first dredge - up .",
    "assuming that the dredge - up dilutes a fixed percentage of li for all stars of similar mass and composition , then the star would still appear li - enhanced relative to other post - dredge - up stars in the cluster .",
    "gcs are the best environments to study low - mass stellar evolution .",
    "the common distance to all the member stars makes it easy to determine stellar luminosity .",
    "the common age and small abundance dispersion in most elements implies a similar evolution for all stars .",
    "to first order , a gc is a snapshot of stellar evolution over a sequence of stellar masses at fixed age and mostly fixed metallicity . with reasonably attainable photometric uncertainty , the agb and rgb can be distinguished with a color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) except for the brightest giants , where the agb nearly merges with the rgb .",
    "we exploited the controlled stellar populations of gcs to study the phenomenon of li - rich giants .",
    "we searched for li - rich giants and classified them photometrically as rgb or agb .",
    "section  [ sec : obs ] describes our observations , and section  [ sec : meas ] details the measurement of li and other spectroscopic properties . in section  [ sec : li ] , we define what it means to be `` li - rich '' and quantify the statistics of li - rich giants in gcs .",
    "we address the possible origins of li enhancement in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    "we corrected the observed magnitudes for extinction according to the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "we designed the slitmasks with a minimum slit length of @xmath27 and separation between slits of @xmath28 .",
    "these choices allowed just enough separation between stars to ( 1 ) avoid overlapping spectra and ( 2 ) permit sky subtraction from the empty portions of the slits",
    ". however , these restrictions also forced us to choose among the many stars in the dense gcs .",
    "although several hundred gc giants might have been visible in a single deimos pointing , the slitmask would allow only about 150 targets at most .",
    "we developed target selection strategies to pick out likely giant members of the gcs .    because the 75  slitmasks were designed for different projects over many years , the target selection strategy was not uniform .",

    "in general , selection along the rgb was performed by defining selection regions in the cmd . in some cases ,",
    "where the rgb was well - defined and distinct from the foreground , we drew an irregular polygon around the rgb and selected stars inside of it .",

    "the target selection favored first - ascent rgb stars rather than helium - burning stars on the hb or agb .",

    "these stars did not live long enough to survive in gcs until today .",
    "however , an intermediate - mass agb star could donate its li to a binary companion .",
    "if the companion has a mass less than 0.8  @xmath17 , it would still be visible in the cluster now .",
    "the li would have been transferred while the recipient was still a dwarf star .",
    "this is a favorable configuration for mass transfer because the recipient has a much higher surface gravity than the donor .",
    "although the first dredge - up would deplete some of the li as the recipient evolved onto the rgb , the dredge - up should deplete the same fraction of surface li in all stars .",
    "thus , a star enriched in li before the dredge - up would still appear enriched in li after the dredge - up when compared to stars at the same evolutionary stage .",
    "the abundance of li in the atmosphere of an intermediate - mass agb star can reach up to @xmath187 @xcite , and even higher li abundances have been observed @xcite . if the dwarf star acquires that li abundance early in its life , it could still have @xmath188even more than the value we observed in our four li - rich rgb stars  after it passes through the first dredge - up .",
    "the binary frequency in gcs is around 510% , but it could have been a factor of two higher before dynamical interactions destroyed binary systems @xcite . assuming that the binary mass ratio distribution is flat @xcite and that the initial binary frequency was 20% , about 1.7% of 47  @xmath17 stars would have had companions of 0.8  @xmath17 . in a @xcite initial mass function , 1.3% of 0.08100",
    "@xmath17 stars lie in the mass range 47  @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , about @xmath189 of 0.8  @xmath17 stars once had a companion of 47  @xmath17 .",
    "this frequency is an order of magnitude lower than the li - rich rgb frequency that we observed .",
    "thus , standard hot bottom burning combined with mass transfer could explain about 10% of li - rich red giants .",
    "the majority of li - rich giants need to be produced by a different mechanism . the recent discoveries of li - rich , post - he flash stars @xcite present another possibility for forming li - rich giants on the lower rgb .",
    "these stars are not as li - rich as the predictions from hot bottom burning in intermediate - mass agb stars .",
    "if these post - he flash stars were to be the source of li for stars on the lower rgb , they need to have donated the li after the recipient completed most of its first dredge - up .",
    "suppose that all low - mass , metal - poor giants experience one or more short - lived phases of li enhancement during or after the he core flash .",
    "further suppose that all such giants with companions on the lower rgb will transfer mass to that companion .",
    "a 13  gyr , @xmath190 yonsei - yale isochrone @xcite predicts that a turn - off star had an initial mass of 0.803  @xmath17 and a star at the rgb bump had an initial mass of 0.812  @xmath17 .",
    "a star at the tip of the rgb experiencing its first he core flash had an initial mass of 0.813  @xmath17 . if we again adopt a flat binary mass ratio distribution but reduce the binary fraction to 10% ( the present rather than the initial value ) , then about 0.1% of stars at the he core flash should have a binary companion on the lower rgb between the turn - off and the bump .",
    "this number is at the lower range of the confidence interval that we measured .",
    "the two main suppositions in this scenario deserve scrutiny .",
    "first , we supposed that all gc stars must produce li on the hb or the agb .",
    "although this seems like a severe requirement , it circumvents the puzzle of why some giants appear li - rich and others do not .",
    "instead , all giants experience li enhancement , but the enhancement is short - lived .",
    "this idea  that li enhancement is rare because it is short - lived  has been suggested several times before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if we take our observation of the frequency of li - rich agb stars , @xmath191 , as representative of all post - he flash stars , then this frequency is equal to the duty cycle of li enhancement .",
    "the post - rgb ( hb and agb ) lifetime of a 13  gyr , @xmath190 star is about 130  myr @xcite . in our scenario , all such stars spend 2  myr in a state of li enhancement .",
    "second , we supposed that all post - rgb stars with companions on the lower rgb will transfer mass .",
    "the lower rgb stars have higher surface gravities than the hb and agb stars . therefore ,",
    "if mass transfer occurs , the hb or agb star will be the donor .",
    "mass transfer becomes less favorable as the mass difference between the two stars becomes smaller because the secondary star will have a lower surface gravity .",
    "after the first dredge - up and before the rgb bump , the mass of the convective envelope in the recipient star is 0.230.40  @xmath17 @xcite . in order to enrich the star to @xmath192 , a typical value for the li - rich rgb stars",
    "we observed , the star would need to acquire @xmath193 of li .",
    "this could be accomplished , for example , by accreting 0.03  @xmath17 of the envelope of an hb or agb star that enriched itself to @xmath194 .",
    "this amount of mass transfer is not unreasonable .",
    "in fact , a single 0.8  @xmath17 agb star with @xmath195 can lose one quarter of its mass in thermal pulses @xcite .",
    "however , we also note that low - mass , low - metallicity agb stars are expected to generate @xmath196-process elements , like barium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the ba@xmath36ii@xmath356496  line is apparent ( but blended ) in the spectra of all of the li - rich stars we observed .",
    "the line does not appear any stronger than it appears in the li - normal stars of similar stellar parameters .",
    "thus , it does not seem that either the li - rich agb stars or the li - rich rgb stars are very enhanced in the @xmath196-process .",
    "the lack of @xmath196-process enrichment in li - rich gc giants is consistent with metal - rich , li - rich giants @xcite .",
    "these observations demand that the li be created in the agb star and/or transferred to the rgb companion before thermal pulses can dredge up large amounts of @xmath196-process material .    in our scenario ,",
    "the donor star is no longer visible because it has evolved past the agb into a white dwarf , too faint to be observed .",
    "however , the recipient rgb star is still in orbit around the white dwarf .",
    "we predict that li - rich red giants should show radial velocity variations .",
    "our prediction warrants multi - epoch spectroscopy for those red giants that we found to be li - rich .",
    "we also note that hb or agb stars that generate li themselves need not have a binary companion .",
    "in fact , only @xmath197 of those stars should have a companion @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not worrisome that @xcite did not find radial velocity variations around the li - rich hb star they discovered in trumpler  5 .",
    "although giant stars should deplete li , some li - rich giants exist .",
    "some of these giants have li abundances in excess of the primordial value of the universe , which indicates that the li is being created , not merely saved from destruction .",
    "we examined several proposals for li enrichment : engulfment of a substellar companion , self - generation , and binary mass transfer .",
    "a gc is the best site to study stellar evolution because it is a single - age , nearly mono - metallic stellar population at a uniform distance . in a survey similar to that of @xcite",
    ", we searched for li - rich giants in gcs .",
    "the primary difference between our studies is that our sample size was seven times larger , thanks to the multiplexing of keck / deimos .",
    "we measured li abundances or useful upper limits in 1827  giants across 25  gcs .",
    "we defined a luminosity - dependent criterion for li - richness , and we found that six stars satisfied that criterion .",
    "the overall frequency for li - richness in gcs is @xmath177 .",
    "some of the proposed scenarios for li enrichment predict different frequencies of li - rich giants at different evolutionary states .",
    "although many non - asteroseismological studies can not confidently disentangle the rgb and agb for field stars , we exploited the simplicity of gc stellar populations to assign rgb or agb identities to each star in our sample .",
    "we found that the frequency of li - richness is @xmath0 on the rgb and @xmath1 on the agb .",
    "a poisson rate ratio test returns an 88% probability that these two frequencies differ .",
    "we found no correlation between the li - rich frequency and any property of the gcs , including metallicity .",
    "the fact that we found li - rich giants in extremely metal - poor gcs disfavors exoplanet engulfment as the origin of the li because exoplanets are not expected to form around extremely metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , searches for transiting exoplanets in gcs have found none @xcite .",
    "our observations also disfavor self - generation of li on the rgb .",
    "all four of the li - rich rgb stars we found are on the lower rgb , less luminous than the rgb luminosity function bump .",
    "li - rich rgb stars in gcs have also been found above the bump @xcite .",
    "most of the proposed explanations for li self - generation predict that it will occur at the bump or after the he core flash ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one exception is rotationally induced mixing @xcite , but one study with the spectral resolution to measure rotation rates in metal - poor , li - rich field giants @xcite found normal rotation rates .",
    "our discovery of four new low - luminosity , li - rich giants adds to the growing evidence that li - rich giants can be found at any evolutionary stage ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the wide luminosity range of li - rich giants rules out most of the proposed scenarios for li self - generation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found li - rich giants on the hb , where stars have recently experienced a he core flash .",
    "@xcite  supported the identification of their star as a he core - burning , hb star with kepler asteroseismology .",
    "these discoveries could suggest that the he core flash could incite extra deep mixing that activates the cameron ",
    "fowler conveyor .",
    "this explanation applies only to stars on the hb or agb , not the rgb .",
    "however , a post - flash , li - rich star could transfer li to a binary companion on the rgb .",
    "if all post - rgb stars experience brief phases of li enhancement and all such stars in binaries transfer mass to their companions , then we expect 0.1% of stars on the lower rgb to be li - rich .",
    "this frequency is consistent with our observations , but it is at the low end of our confidence interval .",
    "our proposed scenario for explaining li - rich giants requires the acceptance of several stringent assumptions , but it solves several nagging problems .",
    "first , low - luminosity li - rich giants in gcs do not need to be `` special '' compared to other li - normal stars .",
    "they merely need to be in a mass transfer binary with a li - enhanced star .",
    "second , the rarity of the luminous li - rich giants can be explained by a fast duty cycle of li enhancement .",
    "these stars are `` special '' only because we happened to observe them during a li - rich phase .",
    "finally , the li enhancement does not require the accretion of a exoplanet , whose existence is disfavored in gcs @xcite .",

    "<S> globular clusters are the best sites to examine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership in the cluster and to identify the evolutionary state of each star . in 72  hours of keck / deimos exposures in 25  clusters , we found four li - rich rgb and two li - rich agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> there were 1696  rgb and 125  agb stars with measurements or upper limits consistent with normal abundances of li . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the frequency of li - richness in globular clusters is @xmath0 for the rgb , @xmath1 for the agb , and @xmath2 for all giants . because the li - rich rgb stars are on the lower rgb , li self - generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the luminosity function bump or he core flash can not explain these four lower rgb stars . </S>",
    "<S> we propose the following origin for li enrichment : ( 1 ) all luminous giants experience a brief phase of li enrichment at the he core flash . ( 2 ) all post - rgb stars with binary companions on the lower rgb will engage in mass transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario predicts that 0.1% of lower rgb stars will appear li - rich due to mass transfer from a recently li - enhanced companion . </S>",
