    "a standard scheme to transfer population in an atom or molecule from one ground state to another through an excited state employs a sequence of laser pulses that first connects the _ final _ state with the intermediate one , and only then the initial state @xcite .",
    "if this process is executed adiabatically , the atom stays in a ( field - dependent ) superposition of ground states , and ideally the intermediate state is never populated , thus strongly suppressing decays out of the usually unstable excited state , while still achieving population transfer with almost 100% efficiency . in quantum communication one attempts to transfer quantum information from one location to another over a usually noisy channel . if one could similarly avoid populating the intermediate noisy state , this would be useful both for distributed quantum computing and for quantum cryptography , as losses due to photon absorption could be partially avoided this way , and as an eavesdropper would not be able to use eavesdropping techniques that rely on the actual presence of the photon .",
    "although the two situations are different , the mathematical descriptions are sufficiently similar to suggest that the effect should exist in quantum communication as well . here",
    "we investigate this idea in a realistic physical setup .    in @xcite",
    "a physical implementation for communication in a quantum network has been proposed , based on high - q cavity qed : atoms inside cavities store quantum information while photons , produced by laser manipulation of the atoms , are the data buses , carrying information from one cavity to another . in that proposal ,",
    "laser pulses were designed in such a way that one atom - cavity systemproduces a time - symmetric photon wave packet , so that the seemingly unavoidable reflection of the photon wave packet from the almost perfectly reflecting mirror of a second distant cavity is prevented . in the same setup ,",
    "a different idea @xcite is to use adiabatic passage to accomplish the coherent transfer of quantum information through a dark cavity state : ideally there is never a photon inside the cavity .",
    "it is the latter scheme that forms the inspiration for the present work : is it possible to communicate between two cavities using a dark `` fiber '' state and thus diminish losses inside the fiber that connects the cavities ? or , stated somewhat differently , can one do without a photon altogether ?",
    "although error correction schemes have been designed specifically for photon absorption errors @xcite , it would be even better to avoid the error .",
    "the physical system under consideration consists of two high - q optical cavities connected by a quantum channel ( which can be an optical fiber for longer distances , or just the vacuum for shorter distances ) , which will be called the `` fiber '' from now on .",
    "we choose the optical frequency domain because thermal optical photons are practically absent at room temperature .",
    "there are ( at least ) two ways of describing the electromagnetic field modes in the presence of the cavities and fiber .",
    "one description defines cavity modes and fiber modes separately , each mode being represented by creation and annihilation operators that satisfy the standard commutation relations .",
    "there is a linear coupling arising from the fact that the cavity mirrors are not perfect and transmit a small fraction of the incident light from cavity to fiber and _ vice versa_. this description has an obvious interpretation , but the definition of cavity and fiber modes is valid in principle only for high - finesse systems , for time scales long compared to the roundtrip time , and for operation close to resonance ( for instance , only then standard commutation rules are satisfied @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , although we will use the terminology corresponding to the picture of cavity and fiber modes , in the calculations we will instead employ a different , rigorous description in terms of second - quantized fields in the complete system consisting of 2 cavities placed at a distance @xmath0 .",
    "one goal of this paper is to extend the analysis of @xcite , which used the simpler description .    for each longitudinal field mode",
    "there are in principle infinitely many transverse modes . however , the spherical mirrors of the cavity lift the degeneracy of those transverse modes by such a large amount that only one mode is nonnegligibly coupled to an atom inside the cavity .",
    "this single transverse mode in turn couples only to a single transverse mode outside the cavity @xcite .",
    "this situation justifies , for our purposes , using a 1-dimensional model where each mode is characterized by a single wave number @xmath1 .",
    "we thus model the two cavities of length @xmath2 at distance @xmath0 by two perfect mirrors located at @xmath3 and two highly reflecting ( but not perfect ) mirrors located at @xmath4 .",
    "the transmission coefficients of these imperfect mirrors are taken to be identical and equal to @xmath5 with @xmath6 real , and the reflectivity is then @xmath7 .",
    "this model for a mirror corresponds to that of a dielectric with thickness @xmath8 and dielectric constant @xmath9 in the limit @xmath10 and @xmath11 constant .",
    "a photon inside such a cavity leaks out through the partially transparent mirror at a rate @xmath12 .      the normal modes @xmath13 and @xmath14 for a system consisting of just the two imperfect mirrors located at @xmath4 have been calculated in @xcite ( eqs .",
    "( 11 ) and ( 12 ) ) .",
    "we need certain combinations of these modes , denoted by @xmath15 , that satisfy additional boundary conditions @xmath16 at @xmath3 .",
    "there are two types of such modes , which we refer to as even and odd modes resp . , which can be written as @xmath17,\\ ] ] for each @xmath1 that is a solution of @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are reflection and transmission coefficients as defined in eqs .",
    "( 1519 ) of @xcite . inside the two cavities ,",
    "the mode functions take the simple form @xmath22\\,\\,\\,{\\rm for}\\,\\,\\ , z<-z+l,\\nonumber\\\\ u_k(z)\\mp u'_k(z)&=&\\mp 2 \\sin [ k(z - z)]\\,\\,\\,{\\rm for } \\,\\,\\ , z > z - l,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the boundary conditions are indeed fulfilled .",
    "the normalization factors are @xmath23 where @xmath24 give the cavity and fiber contributions , @xmath25\\frac{|t|^2}{|1\\pm r\\exp(ikl)|^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq ] ) has been solved numerically , and typical results for the case we are interested in , with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "from now on we will for convenience denote the modes by the index @xmath28 .      inside each of the 2 cavities we have one atom , denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , that we use to store qubits . both atoms",
    "are assumed to possess 2 ground states , denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the field modes @xmath33 couple state @xmath31 to an excited state @xmath34 with coupling strengths @xmath35 , which depend on the positions of the atoms : for an atom at position @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( i.e. inside one of the two cavities ) we have @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the area of the light beam and @xmath8 and @xmath40 are the dipole moment and resonance frequency of the atom .",
    "the phase factor @xmath41 with @xmath42 even for the even modes and odd for the odd modes arises from the corresponding phase factor in the mode functions inside the two cavities ( cf .",
    "( [ inside ] ) ) .",
    "as expected , an atom inside one of the cavities couples mainly to the modes with a large `` cavity mode '' content , for which @xmath43 and thereby @xmath44 becomes small .",
    "the state @xmath34 in turn is coupled to state @xmath32 by a laser field of different polarization at frequency @xmath45 with a rabi frequency @xmath46 . in order to diminish the effects of spontaneous emission from the excited state @xmath34 ( at a rate @xmath47 ) the laser detuning from that state",
    "is taken to be much larger than all other rates in the problem .",
    "in particular we take @xmath48 , and henceforth we neglect @xmath47 .    the same condition on @xmath49 justifies eliminating the upper state adiabatically , and the hamiltonian describing the interaction between the two ground states and the field modes is then ( in a frame rotating at the laser frequency ) @xmath50 , \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the summation is over all modes @xmath33 , @xmath51 is the ac - stark shift due to the laser field , @xmath35 is the coupling constant with mode @xmath33 , as given in ( [ gi ] ) , and the effective coupling between the two ground states through mode @xmath33 is @xmath52 . as in @xcite , the laser phase @xmath53 can be chosen to compensate for the time - dependent shift @xmath54 of @xmath32 .",
    "the total hamiltonian then consists of the sum of the free ( effective ) hamiltonian for the field modes , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the detuning from mode @xmath33 , and terms like ( [ h ] ) for atoms @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the quantities @xmath57 are determined by numerical solution of ( [ eq ] ) . the easiest way to describe",
    "the evolution of our system is in the schrdinger picture , as in the case of our interest the number of excitations is always at most 1 .",
    "thus we can conveniently denote by @xmath58 the state where all field modes are empty except for mode @xmath33 which has one photon , and by @xmath59 the vacuum state of the field .",
    "the initial state @xmath60 is coupled to a set of intermediate states where one photon is in one of the modes @xmath33 , @xmath61 , which in turn are coupled to the desired final state , where the excitation has been transferred to atom @xmath30 : @xmath62 .",
    "the evolution equations in the interaction picture for the corresponding amplitudes @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are given by @xmath66 where the index @xmath67 refers to the atoms @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the ac - stark shifts due to the atomic coupling @xmath35 to the modes @xmath33 have been absorbed into the amplitudes @xmath64 , and similarly the phases @xmath68 have been absorbed into the amplitudes @xmath63 and @xmath65 , respectively . note that there is no delay time @xmath69 appearing explicitly in these equations ; nevertheless , since the whole mode structure derived from maxwell s equations is present , this delay is incorporated implicitly , and hence causality will not be violated .",
    "finally , let us return to the phase factor @xmath41 in the coupling coefficients ( [ gi ] ) .",
    "the alternating sign of the coupling is not harmless .",
    "in fact , it prevents the existence of a perfect dark state in this multimode system : a superposition of ground states not coupled to the even modes , is coupled to the odd modes , and _",
    "vice versa_. we can compare this situation with that of population transfer in an atom : we recall that population transfer through a _",
    "single _ continuum of intermediate states is very well possible ( in fact , in a simple model case the transfer is found to be complete @xcite , but in reality there inevitably are effects which will reduce the benefits of adiabatic passage through a continuum @xcite ) .",
    "however , the situation at hand is , at least for large intercavity distances , like that of an atom with _ two _ independent continua ( corresponding to the odd and even modes , resp . ) , where any beneficial interference effects are canceled out .",
    "thus for large @xmath0 ( a condition to be made more precise below ) , where the mode structure approaches that of a continuum , we do not expect to be able to avoid losses to any degree , irrespective of whether the losses are inside the fiber or the cavity .      as losses , especially due to photon absorption ,",
    "are inevitable , the important question will be what the influence of losses is on the transfer of quantum information .",
    "there are essentially two types of losses : _",
    "( i ) _ photons are irreversibly lost inside the cavity ( this includes photons leaking out of the other side of the cavity ) at a rate @xmath70 .",
    "thus , a fraction @xmath71 of the photons is lost in each of the two cavities ( the remaining fraction @xmath72 going from cavity to fiber ) . _",
    "( ii ) _ photons inside the fiber are absorbed at a rate @xmath73 in terms of the absorption coefficient @xmath74 of the fiber .",
    "the fraction of photons surviving travel through a fiber of length @xmath0 is @xmath75 .    in terms of the modes",
    "@xmath33 , which are mixed cavity / fiber modes , the losses are taken into account by a decay rate @xmath76 of each mode , which is just a weighted average of the fiber and cavity loss rates , @xmath77 where the normalization factors were defined in ( [ norms ] ) .",
    "this relation can be derived from modeling the losses as due to a large set of absorbers ( atoms ) inside cavities and fiber off - resonantly coupled to the modes @xmath33 .",
    "namely , in that case each field mode effectively couples to a continuum , which introduces both a decay @xmath76 and an energy shift @xmath78 according to @xmath79 where the sum is over different types of atoms or atomic levels @xmath80 involved , @xmath81 is the coupling constant to level @xmath80 , @xmath82 the detuning of mode @xmath33 from level @xmath80 , which we approximate to be independent of @xmath33 , @xmath83 the decay rate of level @xmath80 , while @xmath84 gives the number density of atoms with levels @xmath80 at position @xmath85 .",
    "the result ( [ weight ] ) follows from ( [ ci ] ) if we assume the densities @xmath84 to be piecewise constant inside the fiber and inside the two cavities .",
    "we may neglect the shifts @xmath78 if we assume @xmath86 to take both positive and negative values .",
    "in addition to the decay rates , cross couplings between different modes @xmath33 and @xmath87 exist as well , given by @xmath88 we may again neglect the real part of @xmath89 , but the imaginary part is nonzero , and can in fact be related to @xmath90 and @xmath70 : using that @xmath26 we have @xmath91 for modes with the same parity , and @xmath92 for modes of opposite parity .",
    "here we used the orthogonality of the modes @xmath33 : for instance , for @xmath93 we have @xmath94 for all modes , as follows directly from ( [ cii ] ) and the orthogonality relations .",
    "we note that with the assumption of a constant absorber density in the fiber , the number of atoms involved in fiber decay increases linearly with the fiber length @xmath0 .",
    "since at the same time the coupling to each atom goes down with @xmath95 the decay rate of each `` fiber '' mode is indeed independent of @xmath0 , as we already tacitly assumed . for simplicity , we take decay due to losses through the outside mirrors at @xmath96 into account by the same equation ( [ weight ] ) for @xmath76 , as the respective normalization factors can be interpreted as the probabilities of finding a photon from mode @xmath33 in the fiber or inside the cavity , and since it is only the cavity mode that decays through the outside mirrors .    in the presence of losses , the equations ( [ set ] ) for @xmath63 and @xmath65 are still valid , but the third equation is replaced by @xmath97",
    "we numerically solve the equations ( [ set ] ) and ( [ loss ] ) .",
    "the number of modes @xmath33 to be included depends on the fiber length @xmath0 . for each calculation",
    "we have verified that our results have converged with respect to the number of modes included .",
    "we assume that the laser pulses @xmath98 are gaussian in shape , and that the laser pulse in the first cavity is effectively delayed by a time @xmath99 compared to the second pulse , i.e. in real time we have @xmath100 .",
    "thus for @xmath101 the second pulse is actually turned on first .",
    "the optimum delay time turns out to be @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the width of the pulses ( which here is defined by @xmath104 ) . for optimum transfer @xmath103",
    "has to be larger than @xmath105 and much larger than the inverse rabi frequencies so as to satisfy adiabaticity requirements : we took @xmath106 ( except for larger @xmath0 ( @xmath107 ) where we chose @xmath108 ) . given @xmath103",
    ", we then optimize the strength of the laser coupling and laser detuning to find the best possible probability @xmath109 to transfer a qubit from atom @xmath29 to atom @xmath30 .",
    "the parameters chosen in all subsequent analysis correspond to present - day technology @xcite .",
    "we take a wavelength around @xmath110 nm corresponding to the d2 line in cs .",
    "we take @xmath111 for @xmath112 , which implies @xmath113 ; we take a cavity of size @xmath114 m , so that the cavity decay rate equals @xmath115 mhz .",
    "the ( maximum ) coupling between atom and the pure `` cavity mode '' is taken to be @xmath116 mhz , and the detuning is @xmath117 mhz .",
    "we first examine to which extent one needs to populate the intermediate states containing one photon to transmit one qubit in the lossless case ( i.e. @xmath118 ) . as is typical for the adiabatic passage scheme , the total population in the intermediate states",
    "can easily be less than @xmath119 at any time during the entire transmission .",
    "the relevant quantity , however , is not the maximum population , which can be made smaller by simply increasing @xmath103 .",
    "instead one has to consider also the total time that that population is present .",
    "we therefore consider the following . in the picture",
    "that a photon wave packet is produced inside a cavity and subsequently travels through the fiber , we expect the process to take a total time of @xmath120 : the time spent by one photon inside the fiber is @xmath69 , while the time spent inside each cavity is @xmath105 on average .",
    "hence , if we integrate the population in fiber / cavity modes over time , and divide by the amount of population transferred from @xmath121 to @xmath122 in atom @xmath30 and by @xmath120 , we expect this number , @xmath123 to be larger than or equal to 1 .",
    "2 shows , however , that this number may be below unity , and only around a value of @xmath124 m , does this number increase from near 0 to 1 . at this length ,",
    "the effective number of modes coupled to the cavity becomes larger than 1 , and the same threshold will be found in the presence of losses . for smaller @xmath0 , the fact that @xmath125 is smaller than 1 is a manifestation of a dark state and shows that the intermediate states do not have to be fully populated .",
    "we also note that the ratio ( [ ratio ] ) is minimized for maximum transfer of information ( in fact  @xmath126 in all cases ) .",
    "we now turn to the question of how losses affect the transfer of information , in particular , whether the fact that the intermediate states do not have to be fully populated can be exploited to reduce losses .",
    "the probability of sending one photon from one cavity to the other is at most equal to the probability @xmath75 of sending a photon through the fiber multiplied by the probability @xmath127 that the photon leaves the first cavity and enters the second one .",
    "that is , we expect @xmath128 , defined in ( [ p ] ) , to be at most @xmath129 while multiple reflections between the two cavities will reduce this number .",
    "however , as we will show below , it turns out that the losses in transmission of information can be limited to less than indicated by these numbers : in particular , if the cavity losses are dominant that probability can be strictly larger than @xmath127 . in the more general situation where @xmath130 , the probability to transmit a qubit can be strictly larger than @xmath131 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the fiber losses become dominant , the optimum probability of transmitting a qubit over this lossy channel will not be larger than @xmath132 .",
    "the lowest value for the unwanted cavity loss rate was reported in @xcite to be @xmath133s@xmath134 .",
    "the relation @xmath135 has the interpretation that 1 out of 9 cavity photons is lost . at the best wavelength of 1.55 @xmath6 the loss rate in a fused silica optical fiber is only @xmath136s@xmath134 . even at the wavelength of interest here , @xmath110 nm , the fiber loss rate @xmath137s@xmath134 is still much smaller than the cavity loss rate . in this case",
    "the relevant question would be whether one can avoid losses inside the cavity .",
    "indeed , by tuning on resonance with the mode @xmath33 that is most cavity - like the optimum transfer is clearly better than @xmath138 ( this corresponds to using the dark cavity state as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . even better , however , is to tune to the next mode of the same parity : that mode is still strongly coupled to the atoms , but has a smaller cavity mode content and hence decays at a lower rate .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 .    in order to investigate the intermediate regime , where @xmath93 , we show in fig .  4",
    "that the optimum transfer also in that case is better than @xmath139 for not too long fibers : this again is a manifestation of the ( imperfect ) dark state . for long fibers @xmath140 one",
    "reaches @xmath139 as a limit .    on the other hand , for the case where the fiber losses are dominant , our numerical results for @xmath141 ( not shown here ) indicate one can not improve upon the standard exponential loss inside the fiber , even if there is never more than , say , @xmath119 probability to actually find a photon inside the fiber at any time during the transmission .",
    "in conclusion , quantum information can be transferred from one atom to the next by using `` phantom photons '' : the intermediate states where the quantum bit is carried by a photon inside a cavity or inside a fiber need not be fully populated .",
    "neither energy conservation nor causality are violated .",
    "losses due to photon absorption inside the cavities can be diminished this way .",
    "this effect can be viewed as resulting from the fact that one can restrict the number of reflections of the light field inside the cavity to below the number of reflections expected , @xmath142 . on the other hand ,",
    "our results indicate that losses inside the fiber can not be overcome .",
    "the main reason for this @xcite is as follows : in the absence of losses all modes are non degenerate and can in principle be selectively excited . in particular , one can couple the atom to a mode that has only a small amplitude inside the fiber , but has appreciable amplitudes in both cavities . by using those nonlocal modes one can `` skip '' the fiber . in the presence of losses ,",
    "however , the modes become more and more degenerate with increasing absorption due to the cross coupling between the different modes . consequently",
    ", the atom couples to combinations of degenerate odd and even modes that are increasingly localized , i.e. the modes live in either one of the cavities , but not in both . in that case",
    "it would seem the fiber can no longer be skipped . for future research",
    "we suggest here a possibility that perhaps allows one to escape this conclusion : by tayloring laser pulses such that its fourier spectrum contains peaks only at desired mode frequencies one might still be able to prevent fiber losses to some extent , although the argument that the modes become more and more degenerate still applies .",
    "the suppression of losses for present technical capabilities is most efficient on smaller scales , and therefore most useful for distributed quantum computing , as for instance in the setup consisting of micro - fabricated elliptical ion trap arrays proposed in @xcite .",
    "namely , losses can be partially avoided until too many modes are coupled to the cavity modes , i.e. , until @xmath143 , as has been confirmed numerically ; for the parameters used here , pertaining to a cs atom inside a high - finesse fabry - perot cavity , this corresponds to @xmath144 m. this restriction is determined by the quality of the cavity through @xmath145 .",
    "larger quality factors and correspondingly lower decay rates @xmath145 and @xmath70 have been measured for fused silica microspheres @xcite , which would increase the length @xmath146 by at least one order of magnitude . since ,",
    "moreover , such microspheres at a wavelength of @xmath147 would have the same low loss rate @xmath70 as fibers , they in principle are even better candidates for implementing quantum communication or distributed quantum computing , with or without phantom photons .",
