    "the spurious state appears at excitation energy 0.15 mev . for this state ,",
    "the squared modulus of the backward amplitude , @xmath126 , is 15.0 .",
    "this means the forward amplitude , @xmath127 .",
    "in contrast , the lowest - energy physical state appears at 0.75 mev and its @xmath128 is 0.042 .",
    "therefore , the present rpa calculation does not break down for the low - lying @xmath1 modes .",
    "we calculate isoscalar dipole strength ( i.e. , spurious component ) and confirm that the spurious state is well separated from the physical states .",
    "the isoscalar dipole strength is calculated by eq .",
    "( [ db / dw ] ) but for an isoscalar dipole operator @xmath129 .",
    "the isoscalar dipole strength for the low - lying peak is satisfactorily small , @xmath130 e@xmath131@xmath86 , which is about 1 % of the corresponding @xmath1 strength .",
    "therefore , numerical calculation of the spurious state is not serious in the present calculation .",
    "it is worthy to note that the low - lying @xmath1 strengths smeared by lorentzians ( [ fam_smearing ] ) with @xmath120 mev is underestimated compared with those calculated by the diagonalization method which corresponds to a limit of @xmath132 mev .",
    "for example , summations of the @xmath1 strengths below 5 mev , calculated by the diagonalization method and the response function with @xmath120 mev , are 2.366 and 1.809 @xmath123 , respectively , for @xmath121 40 fm .",
    "such underestimation is noticeable for low - lying @xmath1 strengths but not for the gdr region .",
    "small @xmath94 is obviously better but requires large calculation space for obtaining converged @xmath1 strength distribution .",
    "thus we employ the @xmath120 mev in this paper .",
    "in addition , we do not take into account the pairing correlation in the present calculations .",
    "the pairing correlation does not change the qualitative nature of the @xmath1 strength distribution @xcite , but , may enhance the low - energy @xmath1 strength .",
    "therefore , the calculated low - lying @xmath1 strength may become even larger in more realistic calculations .",
    "we have studied the ground state properties and the low - lying @xmath1 strength of @xmath0c using the mean - field approach which does not assume the @xmath2c core .",
    "since the original skyrme interactions we chose do not give a consistent description of the observed ground state properties such as the nuclear size , we adjusted the central part of the skyrme potential .",
    "when we set the neutron fermi level @xmath84 mev , the obtained total reaction cross section reasonably agrees with the measured value . with @xmath133 mev ,",
    "the calculation predicts the low - lying @xmath1 strength comparable with that of the giant dipole resonance . the energy weighted cluster sum rule assuming a @xmath2c core is tested .",
    "the cumulative @xmath1 strength exceeds the sum rule at very low energy due to the contribution of the `` core '' excitation .",
    "such large low - lying @xmath1 strength consists mainly of the excitations from @xmath42 and @xmath4 orbits to the continuum states .",
    "as the excitation energy increases , the contribution of @xmath4 orbit to the low - lying @xmath1 strength develops and could become comparable to that of @xmath42 orbit .",
    "a precise measurement of the low - lying @xmath1 strength and a careful analysis of the neutron orbits , e.g. , the momentum distribution of @xmath2c fragment of @xmath0c breakup  @xcite , are desired to clarify the role of the core excitation in @xmath0c .",
