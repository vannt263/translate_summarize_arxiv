    "the entanglement properties of many - particle quantum states have been the topic of many studies in recent years @xcite .",
    "this holds in particular for the ground state of free fermionic systems .",
    "these are slater determinants , and in this case the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) for some portion of the total system has the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is again a free - particle hamiltonian , see @xcite .",
    "its single - particle eigenfunctions @xmath2 and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath3 can be determined either from the one - particle correlation functions @xcite or from the overlap of the occupied states in the subsystem @xcite .",
    "their properties for the most studied case , namely a segment in a chain of free fermions , are relatively well - known .",
    "thus the low - lying @xmath4 vary roughly linearly with @xmath5 and the slope is proportional to @xmath6 if the subsystem has length @xmath7 and @xmath8 is large .",
    "this leads to a logarithmic variation @xmath9 of the entanglement entropy @xmath10 which is characteristic for critical systems and follows from conformal invariance , see @xcite .",
    "the law was first obtained from an asymptotic analysis of the correlation matrix using the fisher - hartwig conjecture @xcite , and further subleading terms have been derived in the same way @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath2 are largest near the boundaries for small @xmath4 and concentrated in the interior of the subsystem for large @xmath4 .",
    "this can be seen easily from numerical calculations . for a half - filled system ,",
    "there are also analytical expressions in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "altogether , a picture emerges , where the ( entanglement ) hamiltonian @xmath1 has both bulk and boundary - like states with the latter dominating the entanglement .",
    "given the relatively simple form of the correlations ( or the overlap ) , one wonders whether a complete analytical treatment of the problem is possible .",
    "this is , in fact , the case and it turns out that it was done a long time ago by slepian in the analysis of time and band limited signals @xcite .",
    "a good account of the background can be found in his 1982 john von neumann lecture @xcite .",
    "the work has received a large number of citations in very different areas .",
    "the analogy to the entanglement problem , where one deals with limited regions in momentum space ( the fermi sea ) and in real space ( the subsystem ) , was pointed out already by gioev and klich @xcite .",
    "however , while they derived a formula for @xmath10 in higher dimensions , we focus here on the eigenvalue problem .",
    "it turns out that the eigenfunctions @xmath2 , or their fourier transforms , are the ( prolate ) spheroidal functions which appear if one separates the helmholtz equation in elliptical coordinates , or generalizations of them .",
    "they enter in the continuum case because the integral kernel of the entanglement problem commutes with the corresponding differential operator .",
    "those concentrated in the interior of the subsystem are quite familiar objects , namely oscillator functions .",
    "they become more complicated once they touch the boundary . in any case",
    ", the machinery of solving differential equations can be used to obtain their form and also the eigenvalues @xmath3 . in particular ,",
    "an asymptotic analysis is possible and gives the low - lying ones for the case of a large subsystem .",
    "this leads to exactly the same density of states as found in the fisher - hartwig approach @xcite .",
    "if either momenta or positions become discrete , the situation is still similar . working with the other , continuous quantity",
    ", one has a commuting differential operator and can discuss its eigenfunctions .",
    "one should mention that a lot of this material also appears in random matrix theory , because in the gaussian unitary ensemble the same integral kernel enters and the eigenvalues @xmath3 determine the functions of interest , see @xcite .",
    "the connection to this field was pointed out by keating and mezzadri @xcite and also used in @xcite , but again with the focus on the entropy .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the results described above , because they complement the usual approaches and put the entanglement problem into a broader context .",
    "our own contribution is mainly the collection and the presentation , including a number of figures . in section 2",
    "we give a brief general outline of the determination of @xmath2 via correlation and overlap matrices . in section 3",
    "we discuss the case of an infinite continuum system , where the simple sine kernel and the usual spheroidal functions appear , of which we show some examples .",
    "section 4 treats the case of a finite continuum system , where the correlations still lead to an integral equation .",
    "section 5 deals with an infinite lattice where the same equation appears in momentum space . in this case",
    "we also discuss the matrix which commutes with the correlation matrix , as well as the dispersion relation of the @xmath3 .",
    "finally , section 6 contains remarks on semi - infinite systems and higher dimensions and a brief conclusion is given in section 7 .",
    "the structure of the problem is best seen from the formulae for a general lattice system with a discrete set of orthonormal single - particle functions @xmath11 .",
    "a many - particle state @xmath12 in which a set @xmath13 of these is occupied ( the fermi sea ) then is @xmath14 where @xmath15 are creation operators and @xmath16 is the vacuum . with @xmath17",
    "the correlation matrix in state @xmath12 becomes @xmath18 and the rdm in a subsystem @xmath10 is determined by the eigenvalue problem @xmath19 if @xmath10 consists of @xmath7 sites , ( [ corr2 ] ) gives @xmath7 single - particle eigenfunctions @xmath2 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath20 with @xmath21 are their non - integer occupation numbers and related to the @xmath3 via @xmath22 these quantities can also be obtained by constructing the schmidt decomposition of @xmath12 directly @xcite . in this case , one forms new orthonormal functions @xmath23 from the occupied @xmath24 which are orthogonal also in the subsystem ( and in the remainder @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is done by calculating the overlap matrix @xmath26 and solving the eigenvalue problem @xmath27 then @xmath28 satisfies ( [ corr2 ] ) when restricted to @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , its restriction to @xmath25 satisfies the analogue of ( [ corr2 ] ) with eigenvalue @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , it has norm @xmath20 in @xmath10 and norm @xmath30 in @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath2 is normalized in @xmath10 , one has @xmath31 which gives the pair of relations @xmath32 the normalization properties allow to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath20 solely from the @xmath23 if these can be found by some other means ( as will be the case below )",
    ". if one arranges the @xmath20 in decreasing order , the corresponding @xmath23 are less and less concentrated in @xmath10 . for @xmath7 sites in the subsystem , ( [ overlap2 ] ) can have only @xmath7 non - trivial solutions . if the particle number , i.e. the number of states in @xmath13 , exceeds @xmath7 , the remaining @xmath23 have no components in the subsystem and @xmath33 .    in the following we apply these formulae to the case of plane waves , @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "the two eigenvalue problems ( [ corr2 ] ) and ( [ overlap2 ] ) then correspond to working in real space and in momentum space , respectively .",
    "moreover , the state @xmath12 will be a normal fermi sea ( @xmath36 ) and the subsystem @xmath10 a single segment .",
    "the two functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 are then related by a fourier transform limited to a window in @xmath39 space and in real space .",
    "we now consider free fermions on an infinite line with all momentum states @xmath36 filled .",
    "the system then has average density @xmath40 and the correlation matrix is @xmath41 choosing the subsystem @xmath10 as the segment @xmath42 , the eigenvalue problem ( [ corr2 ] ) becomes @xmath43 or in reduced variables @xmath44 with @xmath45 @xmath46 with the _ sine kernel _",
    "@xmath47 similarly , the overlap matrix is @xmath48 and with @xmath49 the eigenvalue problem ( [ overlap2 ] ) becomes @xmath50 thus the equations in real space and in momentum space are identical . in the following",
    ", we will work in real space .",
    "the sine kernel is the `` square '' of another , even simpler symmetric kernel @xmath51 @xmath52 therefore , the eigenvalues @xmath20 of the sine kernel follow from the eigenvalues @xmath53 of @xmath54 via @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 commutes with the second - order _ differential operator _",
    "@xcite @xmath56 provided the functions one operates on are regular at @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the ( real ) eigenfunctions of @xmath54 and @xmath58 can be obtained from @xmath59 this equation has continuous and bounded solutions for all @xmath60 only for a discrete set of values @xmath61 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath62 are the prolate spheroidal wave functions of the first kind and order @xmath63 . in the notation of @xcite these",
    "are called angular functions @xmath64 for @xmath65 and radial functions @xmath66 for @xmath67 ( which fits with our notations of subsystem and remainder ) . both are normalized separately and connected by joining formulae .",
    "their properties have been investigated in great detail , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "studying the solution of ( [ diff_eigen ] ) for _ all _ @xmath60 gives the quantity @xmath23 of ( [ overlap3 ] ) .",
    "of particular interest is the case where the subsystem contains many particles .",
    "since the average number is @xmath68 this corresponds to large @xmath69 .",
    "a qualitative picture of the spheroidal functions can be obtained by observing that for small @xmath60 the operator @xmath70 reduces to @xmath71 and thus to the hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath72 .",
    "the oscillator functions @xmath73 with the hermite polynomials @xmath74 have a spatial extension @xmath75 ( using the classical turning point ) and therefore `` fit '' into the subsystem as long as @xmath76 . under this condition",
    "the exact spheroidal functions resemble them closely , in particular those concentrated fully in the interior .",
    "a picture gallery is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spheroids ] , where we plotted the first 15 spheroidal and oscillator functions for @xmath77 ( @xmath78 . both are normalized to @xmath79 in @xmath80 .",
    "the function @xmath64 has exactly @xmath5 zeros there and is alternatingly even and odd .",
    "one sees that up to @xmath81 the differences are rather small . as @xmath5 increases further ,",
    "the oscillator functions deviate more and have zeros outside the subsystem , while the oscillation of @xmath64 becomes faster near the boundaries . for large @xmath69 , it is logarithmic up to a distance @xmath82 from @xmath83 , i.e. besides @xmath60 the variable @xmath84 $ ] enters , as also found in a continuum approximation for a half - filled lattice system @xcite .",
    "the nature of the eigenfunctions is reflected directly in the occupation numbers @xmath20 which are close to 1 for small @xmath5 and close to zero for large @xmath5",
    ". as discussed below , the transition takes place at @xmath85 .",
    "if one continues @xmath62 to @xmath67 , one finds the eigenfunctions in the remainder @xmath25 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath30 .",
    "these are a kind of mirror image of those in @xmath10 . for small @xmath5",
    ", they are oscillating rapidly near the boundary but have very small amplitudes ( the phenomenon has been termed superoscillation @xcite ) , while for large @xmath5 the behaviour is smooth there and only later an oscillation sets in .",

    "[ fig : spheroidr ] where the @xmath66 are shown for a number of @xmath5 values up to @xmath86 . note that due to the normalization conventions the functions @xmath64 and @xmath66 do not match at @xmath87 the form for @xmath88 can be obtained from @xmath70 by writing @xmath89 which leads to the operator @xmath90 and gives approximately wave - like solutions @xmath91 .",

    "there exists a tridiagonal matrix @xmath190 with the property @xmath191=0 $ ] and it is just the right half of the matrix @xmath156 @xcite .    returning to closed systems , one should mention that a finite ring of @xmath140 lattice sites filled with @xmath117 particles leads to the correlation matrix ( [ corr_cont_fin1 ] ) with @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "for a segment of @xmath7 sites , one can then also find a commuting tridiagonal matrix @xcite which is a generalization of @xmath156 and leads to another discrete version of the spheroidal functions .",
    "the parabolic form of the @xmath194 and @xmath166 is then replaced by trigonometric expressions .",
    "for example @xmath195 , and for @xmath196 one reobtains ( [ tridiagonal2 ] )",
    ".    another generalization concerns higher dimensions .",
    "the case of an infinite continuum with spherical fermi surface and a spherical subsystem has also been studied in detail @xcite . due to the rotational symmetry ,",
    "the eigenfunctions are products of an angular and a radial factor . for the latter",
    ", one finds an integral equation with a bessel function as kernel . again a commuting differential operator exists and is closely related to @xmath70 . for @xmath197 and with @xmath198 @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the azimuthal quantum number .",
    "physically , the additional term can be viewed as a centrifugal potential . as a result",
    ", the eigenfunctions have to vanish at the origin .",
    "they were called _ generalized spheroidal functions _ and",
    "some are shown in @xcite .",
    "for the eigenvalues @xmath201 for fixed @xmath202 one finds very similar results as in one dimension .",
    "we have considered the ground state of free fermions and discussed an approach which determines the reduced density matrix directly via its single - particle eigenfunctions .",
    "it circumvents the original matrices or integral kernels and works instead with differential operators . in the continuum case , this leads to spheroidal functions which are well known in mathematics and appear in various other areas .",
    "physically , they have the character of either bulk or boundary - like states , and it is amusing that , in the first instance , they are close to harmonic oscillator functions . in hindsight , however , one could have guessed that from the appearance of their lattice counterparts . in the lattice case ,",
    "the asymptotic results for the single - particle eigenvalues bridge a gap between the numerical calculations and the fisher - hartwig determinantal formulae which only give a density of states .",
    "we have demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dispersion ] how well the results match .    on the technical level , the approach is rather tedious and inferior to fisher - hartwig calculations .",
    "however , the concept of a commuting operator is interesting and reminiscent of transfer matrix problems in integrable classical lattice models .",
    "it is also interesting that this feature carries over to higher dimensions for spherical subsystems . as to the one - dimensional problem",
    ", one has now an almost complete overview over the properties of the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath1 , but an explicit form is still lacking .",
