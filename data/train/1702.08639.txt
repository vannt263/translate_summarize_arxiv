    "the sts measurements , with the tunneling differential conductance @xmath98 proportional to dos , could serve as very efficient methods to identify the dimension - enriched special structures in dos .",
    "they have verified the diverse electronic properties in sp@xmath99-bonding carbon - related systems .",
    "the measured doss show the splitting @xmath36 and @xmath100 peaks and a finite value near @xmath47 characteristic of the semi - metallic behavior in graphite @xcite , a linear e - dependence vanishing at the dirac point in monolayer graphene , the asymmetry - created peak structures in bilayer graphene @xcite , a prominent peak at @xmath47 arising from partially flat bands in tri - layer and penta - layer abc - stacked graphene @xcite ; the geometry - dependent energy gaps and the asymmetric peaks of 1d parabolic bands in carbon nanotubes @xcite and gnrs . the sts and spin - resolved sts could be utilized to examine five kinds of low - lying doss in f - absorbed gnrs , covering the finite value at @xmath47 , energy gap and spin - polarized peak structures . in short , geometric structures ,",
    "electronic properties and magnetic configurations are enriched by the multi - orbital hybridizations in strong chemical bondings and the spin arrangements .",
    "the interactions of atomic orbitals present 2p@xmath87 - 2p@xmath87 and ( 2p@xmath38,2p@xmath39)-(2p@xmath38,2p@xmath39 ) in c - c bonds , ( 2p@xmath38,2p@xmath39,2p@xmath87)-(2p@xmath38,2p@xmath39,2p@xmath87 ) in f - c bonds , and ( 2p@xmath38,2p@xmath39)-(2p@xmath38,2p@xmath39 ) in f - f bonds .",
    "the geometric structures , electronic and magnetic properties of f - adsorbed gnrs are investigated using the first - principles calculations . the atom - dominated band structure , the spatial charge density , the spin arrangement , and the orbital - projected dos are useful in exploring the orbital- and spin - dependent essential properties . for example ,",
    "band structure , free carrier density , magnetism and dos are determined by which kinds of orbital hybridizations and spin configurations .",
    "the similar analyses could be further generalized to the emergent layered materials , with nanoscale thickness and unique lattice symmetries , covering silicene , germanene , tinene , phosphorene , mos@xmath1 and so on .",

    "each f - absorbed gnr presents an obvious buckling , in which the adatom height and the change of c - c bond length are mainly determined by the very strong fluorination .",
    "the multi - orbital hybridizations in f - c , c - c and f - f bonds , and the edge - dependent spin distributions are responsible for five kinds of electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "the metallic behavior is revealed at certain f - distributions below @xmath101 concentration .",
    "agnrs could create one or two holes per unit cell , respectively , corresponding to the spin - split and spin - degenerate @xmath36-electronic energy bands ( non - magnetism and ferromagnetism ) .",
    "however , zgnrs only exhibit the lower carrier - density case .",
    "on the other hand , the semiconducting systems could survive at various f - adsorptions except for single adatom .",
    "the @xmath36 bonding predominates the essential properties , including the gap - dependent parabolic bands with spin degeneracy ( non - magnetism ) and partially flat bands in the absence / presence of spin splitting ( anti - ferromagnetism ) . under high adatom concentrations , non - magnetic parabolic bands , with an energy gap",
    "are determined by the ( 2p@xmath38,2p@xmath39 ) orbitals of f and c. the 1d energy dispersions are reflected in dos as many anti - symmetric and symmetric peaks .",
    "there exist five kinds of low - lying peak structures characteristic of the main features of essential properties .",
    "the predicted geometric structures , energy bands and doss , could be verified by stm , arpes and sts , respectively , especially for the latter two tools with spin resolution .",
