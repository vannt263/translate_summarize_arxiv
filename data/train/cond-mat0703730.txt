    "even though half a century has passed since the development of a microscopic theory of superconductivity @xcite , it is still not possible to reliably calculate values of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 for a given material ; in fact , one is not even able to reliably predict which materials become superconducting and which do not .",
    "one strategy to make progress in this situation is to establish systematics in @xmath1 as a function of composition across alloy and compound series and then test whether a particular theoretical approach is able to account for these systematics .",
    "a related strategy is to look for systematics in the dependence of @xmath1 on high pressure in a particular class of materials @xcite .",
    "this latter high - pressure  approach has the advantage of being able to track changes in @xmath1 on a single sample , but often has the disadvantage of being able to generate only relatively modest changes in @xmath1 .",
    "the use of the diamond - anvil cell alleviates this problem since , by extending the pressure range to the multi - megabar region , it is capable of generating sizeable changes in the superconducting properties .",
    "the @xmath0 systematics in the simple - metal superconductors like al , in , sn and pb , where the conduction electrons possess @xmath5-character , are very simple , namely , @xmath1 always decreases under pressure , i.e. the superconductivity is weakened @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that the pressure - induced changes in the lattice vibrations dominate over those in the electronic system , leading to a decrease in @xmath1 as the lattice stiffens under pressure . in such simple - metal systems",
    "it is an interesting physics question to explore the manner in which @xmath1 approaches 0 k as the pressure in increased ; pioneering studies in this direction were carried out in the 1970 s by gubser and webb @xcite on superconducting al by combining diamond - anvil cell , dilution refrigeration , and squid detection technology @xcite .",
    "such high - pressure investigations at mk and sub - mk temperatures , however , are extraordinarily difficult and require that the materials studied be highly purified to contain only trace concentrations of magnetic impurities .    rather than use high pressures to _ destroy _ superconductivity , as in the simple metals ,",
    "an alternative approach with perhaps greater promise is to use high pressure to _ create _ superconductivity , i.e. to focus investigations on nonsuperconducting materials which require high pressures to become superconducting . in such studies not only",
    "can the behavior of superconductivity near 0 k be studied , but also the maximum attainable value of @xmath1 for a given class of materials can be explored . of the 52 known superconducting elements , fully 23 only become superconducting if sufficient pressure is applied @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting in this regard are the alkali and noble metals , none of which superconduct at ambient pressure . since they are simple metals , pressure would be expected to weaken the pairing interaction , so they should never become superconducting , no matter how high the pressure . and",
    "yet both cs @xcite and li @xcite do superconduct at sufficiently high pressures , @xmath1 for li even reaching 15 - 20 k. neaton and ashcroft have shown that the electronic structure of li @xcite and na @xcite becomes increasingly non - free - electron - like as the volume available to the conduction electrons outside the ion cores rapidly diminishes under very high pressures .",
    "cs , in fact , becomes a transition metal above @xmath6 3 gpa as its 5@xmath3-band begins to fill through @xmath4 transfer @xcite .",
    "similar considerations are expected to apply to the electronic structure of many simple - metal  materials @xcite . in transition metal and rare earth systems",
    "it has been appreciated for some time that the @xmath3-electron concentration @xmath7 generally increases under pressure and is mainly responsible for the systematic progression of crystal structures under pressure exhibited by both systems @xcite .",
    "superconductivity is most likely to occur in those materials containing one or more nonmagnetic transition metal ( or @xmath3-electron ) elements , notable exceptions being the trivalent metals lu , y , and sc .",
    "why are these three elements not superconducting at ambient pressure , whereas isoelectronic la is ?",
    "the answer may lie in the fact that they simply do nt have a sufficient number of @xmath3 electrons to support superconductivity ; la , on the other hand , has more @xmath3 electrons due to its significantly larger ion core @xcite .",
    "the assertion that lu , y , and sc have an insufficient @xmath3-electron count for superconductivity is supported by the fact that all 3@xmath3- , 4@xmath3- , 5@xmath3-transition metals in columns iv and v do superconduct at ambient pressure , and those in column v with their greater @xmath3-electron count have values of @xmath1 roughly @xmath8 higher .",
    "increasing the @xmath3-electron concentration in lu , y , and sc by applying high pressure would be expected , therefore , to promote superconductivity . indeed ,",
    "_  et al . _",
    "_ were the first to show this to be true for lu @xcite , y @xcite , and sc @xcite .",
    "whereas in la @xmath0 passes through a maximum near 13 k @xcite , that for y continues to increase to the highest pressure applied ( @xmath9 k at 1.2 mbar ) .",
    "@xmath1 for lu @xcite and sc @xcite also increases under pressure , but only reaches values of 2.5 k _ _  _ _ and 0.35 k at 22 gpa and 21.5 gpa , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we extend the earlier studies @xcite on elemental sc to much higher pressures .",
    "@xmath1 increases monotonically with pressure , reaching 8.2 k at 74.2 gpa . to help illuminate the nature of the superconductivity for all four trivalent metals sc , y , lu , and",
    "la , we search for systematics in the dependence of @xmath1 on the free volume fraction available to the conduction electrons .",
    "the diamond anvil cell used contains two opposing 1/6-carat , type ia diamond anvils with 0.4 mm diameter culets .",
    "a miniature sc sample ( @xmath6 70 @xmath10 m diameter @xmath11 35 @xmath10 m thick ) is cut from a high - purity ingot ( 99.98% metals basis ) obtained from the materials preparation center of the ames laboratory @xcite and placed in a 180 @xmath10 m diameter hole electro - spark drilled through the center of a gold - sputtered nimo gasket 3 mm in diameter by 250 @xmath10 m thick and preindented to 45 @xmath10 m thickness .",
    "tiny ruby spheres @xcite are placed next to the sc sample to allow the determination of the pressure _ in situ _ at 20 k with resolution @xmath12 0.2 gpa .",
    "we use the revised ruby pressure scale of chijioke _ et al .",
    "the r1 ruby fluorescence line remains sharp up to the highest pressures confirming the near hydrostaticity of the pressure environment in the present experiment .    at the beginning of the experiment ,",
    "the sc sample and ruby spheres are placed in the gasket hole . the pressure cell",
    "is then placed in a continuous flow cryostat ( oxford instruments ) and submerged in liquid helium . to insure that no bubbles of gaseous he are trapped inside the gasket , the helium is cooled below the lambda point before sealing the high pressure volume by pressing the diamonds into the gasket . at the highest pressures the sc sample remained completely surrounded by the nearly hydrostatic dense helium pressure medium . to reduce the possibility of he diffusion into the diamond anvils",
    ", the temperature was kept below 180 k during the entire experiment . following the initial compression at 1.6 k",
    ", the pressure was only changed between 100 k and 180 k.    the superconducting transition is detected inductively using a balanced primary / secondary coil system connected to a stanford research sr830 digital lock - in amplifier via a sr554 transformer preamplifier ; the excitation field for the ac susceptibility studies is 3 oe r.m.s . at 1023 hz . to facilitate the recognition of the superconducting transition ,",
    "a temperature - dependent background signal @xmath13 is subtracted from the measured susceptibility data ; @xmath13 is obtained by measuring at pressures too low to induce superconductivity .",
    "a relatively low noise level is achieved by using the transformer preamplifier to ensure good impedance matching , varying the temperature very slowly ( 100  mk / min ) at low temperatures , using a long time constant ( 30 s ) on the lock - in amplifier , and averaging over 2 - 3 measurements .",
    "further experimental details of the high pressure and ac susceptibility techniques are published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in fig .  1 we show the results of the present ac susceptibility measurements for nearly hydrostatic pressures from 54.3 to 74.2 gpa .",
    "the real part of the ac susceptibility @xmath14 decreases abruptly by 3 - 4 nv upon cooling through the superconducting transition .",
    "@xmath1 is seen to increase monotonically with pressure .",
    "signal fluctuations arising from the @xmath15he boiling point and superfluid transition prevented the acquisition of reliable data below 4 k. the shift in @xmath16 8.2 k under an applied dc magnetic field up to 500 oe was less than the experimental resolution , implying that @xmath17 mk / oe . since values of @xmath18 at low fields for type i superconductors are typically a few mk / oe , the superconductivity in sc is likely type ii , as in la and y. for an y sample with @xmath19 9.7 k at 46.6 gpa @xcite , @xmath1 was found to decrease under magnetic fields to 500 oe at the rate @xmath20 mk / oe .    in fig .",
    "2 the dependence of @xmath1 on pressure for sc is shown from the present experiment to 74.2 gpa and compared with the previous quasihydrostatic pressure results of wittig _ et al_. @xcite to  21.5 gpa .",
    "it is worth noting that , in contrast to the results for y , the dependence of @xmath1 on pressure for sc exhibits an upward ( positive ) curvature , in spite of the fact that its compressibility _ decreases _ with increasing pressure @xcite .",
    "the accelerating increase in @xmath1 with pressure in sc gives hope that much higher values of @xmath1 can be reached in future experiments in the multi - megabar pressure range .",
    "we now compare the change in @xmath1 under pressure from all known high - pressure experiments on sc , y , la , and lu . instead of simply plotting @xmath1 versus pressure , we plot in fig .",
    "3 @xmath1 versus the ratio @xmath21 of the wigner - seitz radius @xmath22 to the ion core radius @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this ratio is directly related to the free volume available to the conduction electrons outside the ion cores ; the relative decrease in this free volume under pressure is particularly rapid as the ion cores draw close together and begin to overlap . johansson and rosengren @xcite were the first to recognize that the ratio @xmath21 appears to play an important role in characterizing the pressure dependence of @xmath1 in y , la , lu and la - y , and la - lu alloys as well as in the equilibrium crystal structure sequence across the rare - earth series . duthie and pettifor @xcite subsequently demonstrated for la and lu that the correlations in the structure sequence are a consequence of the fact that the @xmath3-band occupancy @xmath7 increases under pressure due to @xmath4 transfer as the equilibrium atomic volume decreases .",
    "although differing in detail , the @xmath1 versus @xmath21 data in fig .  3 for y , la , sc , and lu have important features in common , namely , that as @xmath21 decreases under pressure , @xmath1 initially rises rapidly , reaching @xmath6 3 - 4 k for values of @xmath21 between 1.9 and 2.1 .",
    "the fact that superconductivity in sc initiates at the relatively large ratio @xmath24 fueled our interest in this metal since it suggested to us that sufficient pressure might yield relatively high values of @xmath1 . with the exception of sc , the similarities in the pressure dependences of @xmath1 in fig .",
    "3 are matched by the similarities in the pressure - induced changes in crystal structure @xcite which fit in quite well with the well - known hcp @xmath25 sm - type @xmath25 dhcp @xmath25 fcc structure sequence characteristic for the rare - earth metals .",
    "this is not surprising since , with the exception of eu and yb , all rare earths are also trivalent @xmath3-electron metals .",
    "sc falls somewhat out of line since it transforms at @xmath6 23 gpa from the hcp to an incommensurate host - guest structure @xcite instead of to the canonical sm - type structure .",
    "in fact , recent x - ray diffraction experiments on sc to 297 gpa reveal four successive structure changes , the final being to a new helical chain structure above 240 gpa @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the differences between sc and the other trivalent @xmath3-electron metals may arise at least in part from the changes in electronic structure associated with the complete absence of @xmath3-electrons in sc s ionic core , thus allowing its 3@xmath3 valence electrons to penetrate further into the core region ( no orthogonality condition ) and thus to assume a higher degree of localization @xcite .",
    "the slow monotonic increase in the @xmath26 vibration mode and the @xmath27 elastic shear modulus of sc under pressure are also anomalous @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 it is seen that the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath21  for sc matches rather well that for la but lies above those for y and lu . that the @xmath1 versus @xmath21 dependences for these four trivalent @xmath3-metals do nt map on top of each other is not surprising . a more relevant parameter for superconductivity than the ratio",
    "@xmath21 might be the number of @xmath3-electrons per atom in the conduction band @xmath7 . for la and lu under ambient conditions , for example , duthie and pettifor @xcite estimate that @xmath28 and 1.9 , respectively .",
    "were the @xmath0 versus @xmath29 dependences for these four elemental metals to fall closely together , this would suggest that the simple @xmath3-electron count has a particularly close tie to the superconductivity .",
    "it is , of course , clear that a detailed understanding of @xmath0 must necessarily take into account pressure - induced changes in crystal structure . however , if we have learned anything in the field of superconductivity , it is that real progress often entails searching for and identifying overriding systematics .",
    "the available data from experiment and theory are not yet sufficiently complete that a possible correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath7 can be properly identified . still needed for this purpose",
    "are :  ( 1 ) further @xmath0 data on y , lu , and sc to much higher pressures , and ( 2 ) an accurate estimate of @xmath29 for all four trivalent @xmath3-elements from a unified electronic structure calculation .    acknowledgments .",
