    "future large scale survey projects such as panstarrs and lsst are expected to generate automated rapid turnaround transient alerts for objects such as supernovae , active galactic nuclei , asteroids , kuiper belt objects , and variable stars .",
    "they will do this by comparing new images to coadded stacks of reference images taken previously .",
    "repeat observations of the same field will occur over timescales of minutes , hours , days , months , and years .",
    "robust rejection of spurious non - astrophysical objects will be crucial to avoid excessive false positive alerts .",
    "a major difficulty of current optical transient programs is the huge number of false positive objects which are difficult to reject while maintaining high selection efficiency for the real objects of interest .",
    "for example , the 2005 sloan digital sky survey ii ( sdss - ii ) supernova program @xcite required objects to be detected within 0.6 arcsec in at least two filters with signal - to - noise greater than 3 , yet this generated @xmath04,000 objects per night which needed to be visually checked by humans for verification .",
    "their 2006 search drastically reduced this scanning load by requiring that all but the brightest objects be identified at the same location on multiple nights before they are passed to a human for verification . although this reduced their scanning load , this method is not applicable to the real - time transient alert pipelines of panstarrs and lsst . a `` 60-second transient alert",
    "'' would be meaningless if it really meant `` @xmath1 days plus 60 seconds after the first positive identification . ''",
    "although panstarrs and lsst will have multiple exposures of a field in the same night , this is equivalent to the multiple - filter requirement of the sdss 2005 program which was still swamped by false positives .",
    "this problem of false positives is not unique to nearby transient searches ; it arises whenever a large number of objects are imaged , either from a wide - field survey or a deep narrow survey . the essence @xcite and snls @xcite canadian pipeline supernova searches both result in 100200 objects to scan per night of data .",
    "although this is a manageable load for a current experiment , it would not scale to future surveys which will image thousands of square degrees per night .",
    "square degree per night , sdss covers 150 square degrees per night , and snfactory covers 350 to 850 square degrees per night . ]",
    "if current methods were used , the projects would need to drastically reduce their signal efficiency in order to maintain a manageable false - positive rate .",
    "the snls french pipeline uses multi - night data and an artificial neural net to select candidates for verification , but as noted above , using multi - night information is not applicable to rapid turnaround transient alert pipelines which intend to produce alerts within a minute of the first positive detection .",
    "false positives arise from a variety of sources including diffraction spikes , saturated stars , optical ghosts , star halos , cosmic rays , satellite trails , ccd amplifier glow , other ccd artifacts , and image processing artifacts . in principle",
    "all of these effects are best identified and either fixed or masked at the image level . in practice there will always be effects which produce spurious detections .",
    "this problem is especially bad at the start of a search when covering new areas of sky , before consistent problems can be identified and masked .",
    "the goal of a classifier is to identify the real candidates of interest ( signal events ) while rejecting the spurious objects ( background events ) .    in some cases ,",
    "real astrophysical variable objects are the background events for other analyses .",
    "for example , asteroids , variable stars , and active galactic nuclei form a background for nearby supernova searches , yet they are the core science for other programs .",
    "this paper is written from the context of a nearby supernova search and thus these other astrophysical events are treated as background to reject , but the methods presented here are generally applicable to many object classification problems .",
    "this paper presents the results of applying modern machine learning techniques to the supernova search pipeline of the nearby supernova factory @xcite . ",
    "[ sec : methods ] presents a variety of machine learning techniques . ",
    "[ sec : snfactory ] describes the nearby supernova factory search , and  ",
    "[ sec : training ] and [ sec : software ] present the training data and classification software used . ",
    "[ sec : comparison ] compares the various methods .",
    "we find that methods such as boosted trees , random forests , and support vector machines perform dramatically better than the threshold cuts which are typically used by supernova search programs .",
    "classification methods identify signal _ vs. _  background events based upon a set of features ( also called variables , attributes , or scores ) which describe the events .",
    "for example , objects in photometric images can be described by their magnitude , signal - to - noise , and shape parameters such as width and ellipticity .",
    "these features can be used to distinguish stars from galaxies , cosmic rays , or imaging artifacts .",
    "the optimum separation of two classes of events is application dependent , depending upon the desired tradeoff between purity ( the fraction of selected events which are real signal ) , completeness ( the fraction of real signal events which are selected ) , and the total sample size selected .",
    "for example , a measurement which depends upon a statistical fit to both signal and background events might optimize the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the number of real signal and background events which the classifier selects for the fit . a supernova search algorithm , on the other hand , might maximize the purity with the constraint that the completeness remain above 90% .",
    "some methods , such as threshold cuts (  [ sec : cuts ] ) , produce a boolean signal / background decision and the cuts themselves must be adjusted to optimize the separation .",
    "other methods have an automated training procedure and produce a single statistic which rates how signal - like or background - like a new event is .",
    "the user may then cut on that statistic to optimize the desired figure of merit .",
    "classifier parameters are tuned using a training dataset of known signal and background events to optimize the separation power .",
    "since the results are influenced by the particular statistical fluctuations of the training dataset , the separation power on the training data itself can not be used as a fair measure of the power of a classifier . instead",
    ", a separate validation set is used to assess the performance .",
    "if enough training data is available , one uses one dataset to train a variety of classifiers with different parameters , a second dataset to select which set of parameters produces the best classifier , and a third dataset to validate the final performance . ideally one trains and validates using real data ; in practice simulated data are often used for training and validation before applying the classifier to real data .",
    "it is important to note that the quality and power of any classifier will be affected by the accuracy of the training sample . one must be careful to minimize and measure any biases introduced through a simulated training sample which does not completely reflect real data .",
    "automated supernova searches have typically operated by applying simple threshold cuts to the features describing objects .",
    "for example , a supernova search might keep objects which have a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath5 , astrometric positions that agree to within 1 arcsec on 2 or more images , and a width consistent with stars on the images ( _ e.g. _ , within a factor of 2 of the median width of stars ) .",
    "if an object fails any of these cuts , it is rejected .",
    "these cuts are easy to understand but do not reflect the subtleties of a multidimensional space .",
    "an object which just barely fails one of the cuts is still rejected the same as an object which fails many cuts .",
    "it also does not naturally handle correlations between the variables , _",
    "e.g. , _ between the @xmath6 and the astrometric accuracy . and astrometric positions to form an uncorrelated variable ; accomplishing this in the general case for a large number of variables is non - trivial . ] to use threshold cuts",
    ", one must find uncorrelated variables without significant outliers such that every cut maintains a high signal efficiency while rejecting background .    compared to curved boundary selections ,",
    "threshold cuts are also an inefficient way to select a subset of a hyperspace as the number of dimensions grows large @xcite , even for dimensions as few as 5 .",
    "_ e.g. _ , for 3 dimensions , the volume ratio of a cube to its embedded sphere is 1.9 ; for 5 dimensions it is 6.1 , and for 10 dimensions it is 401.5 .",
    "this ratio goes to infinity as the number of dimensions increases .",
    "thus if a set of signal events is distributed as an ellipsoid in some feature space , an ellipsoid shaped selection contains much less volume ( and thus likely much less background ) than the equivalently dimensioned hypercube .",
    "although commonly used in supernova searches , threshold cuts are widely recognized as being a non - optimal method for signal / background separation problems .",
    "the following sections describe a variety of more powerful techniques for identifying supernovae in difference images .      a more sophisticated approach models the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the signal and the background for each of the features .",
    "the combined probability of all of the feature values for an object is used to make the signal / background decision .",
    "this improves over threshold cuts by eliminating rejections based upon a slightly marginal value of a single feature , but it requires a detailed modeling of the pdf of each feature , including all correlations and outliers in the distributions .",
    "this suffers from the `` curse of dimensionality '' @xcite : since the volume of a hyperspace grows exponentially with the number of dimensions , the size of a training sample must also grow exponentially to adequately determine the pdfs .",
    "if the signal and background features are gaussian distributed with only linear correlations , fisher discriminant analysis @xcite finds the best linear combination of features to maximize the separation of the two classes .",
    "figure [ fig : fisher ] shows a toy example of data which would be well separated using fisher discriminant analysis .",
    "the two classes of events ( blue triangles and red squares ) are not well separated by either feature @xmath7 or @xmath4 , but their correlation is such that the combination @xmath8 provides very good separation of the two classes .    more generally , if a set of events @xmath9 in some feature space have means @xmath10 and covariances @xmath11 for classes 0 and 1 , then a linear combination @xmath12 will have means @xmath13 and covariances @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a set of coefficients defining a linear combination of the features .",
    "the separation of the two classes may be defined as @xmath16 _",
    "i.e. _ , the separation of the means is measured in units of the variances .",
    "fisher showed that the maximum separation is achieved when @xmath17 the means and covariances of the signal ( 1 ) and background ( 0 ) classes may be estimated from a training sample , and thus the calculation of the best linear combination for separating the classes is simply a matrix inversion .",
    "this method breaks down when there are non - linear correlations or when there are significant outliers or otherwise non - gaussian variances such that a simple mean and covariance is not a good descriptor of the feature distributions for the two classes . in practice ,",
    "fisher discriminant analysis is most often used to combine several linearly correlated features into a single feature to reduce the dimensionality of a problem before applying another classification method .",
    "decision trees @xcite separate signal from background events by making a cascading set of event splits as shown in figure [ fig : decisiontree ] .",
    "this forms a generalization of threshold cuts by selecting many hypercubes in the multi - dimensional feature space rather than a single hypercube of cuts .",
    "the training procedure described below automatically selects the features and cut values to generate a tree with maximal separation of signal and background events .",
    "the training procedure begins with a sample of training events and considers all features and cut values to form two subsets with the best separation of signal and background .",
    "the procedure is recursively applied to each of the subsets to form further branches .",
    "the recursion is stopped when some condition is met , _",
    "e.g. _ , the subset is entirely signal or background , or the subset has reached a minimum allowed size ( a minimum size requirement prevents overtraining on statistical fluctuations of small samples ) .",
    "the terminal nodes which are not further split are called leaves , and are assigned as either signal or background leaves depending upon the training events which ended up on those leaves .",
    "there are a variety of ways to define the best separation at each split ; for this study we used the gini parameter @xcite , which is widely used and provides robust performance .",
    "define the purity of a sample of training events as @xmath18 where the sums are over the signal events @xmath3 and background events @xmath4 and @xmath19 are a set of event weights .",
    "typically all of the weights are the same and their absolute normalization is arbitrary . if needed , relative weights may be used to increase the influence of an underrepresented subsample of the training data .",
    "the role of weights will be more important in the boosted trees method described in  [ sec : boostedtrees ] .",
    "note that @xmath20 for a sample of pure signal events , @xmath21 for a sample of pure background events , and @xmath22 for a sample which is either purely signal or purely background .",
    "define @xmath23 where the sum is over all events in that sample . at each node",
    ", the training procedure considers all possible features and cut values to minimize the quantity @xmath24 to find the best separation of events . if this split would not increase the overall quality of the tree ,",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 then the node is left as a leaf node , assigning it as a signal leaf if @xmath26 and a background leaf otherwise .",
    "if the split would increase the overall quality of the tree , the events are split into two nodes and the procedure is recursively applied to each of those nodes until the stopping conditions are met ( _ e.g. _ , minimum leaf sizes ) or no splits can be found which would improve the overall quality of the tree .",
    "decision trees are a generalization of threshold cuts and thus have more flexibility to optimally select a set of signal events within a feature space .",
    "however , single decision trees tend to be unstably dependent upon the details of the training set .",
    "a small change in the training set can produce a considerably different tree and thus a considerably different performance on the validation set .",
    "boosting algorithms improve the performance of a classifier by giving greater weight to events which are hardest to classify . in the case of decision trees ,",
    "a tree is trained on a set of data , misclassified events are identified and their weights are increased , and the process is repeated to form new trees .",
    "this iteratively produces a set of increasing quality decision trees .",
    "the final classifier uses the weighted ensemble average of all of the trees to make a classification decision .",
    "the boosting provides decision trees with better separation power , and the ensemble average washes out the training instabilities associated with single decision trees . in applications with @xmath020 or more input features , boosted decision trees can provide significantly better results than artificial neural networks @xcite ; see also  [ sec : ann ] .",
    "there are a variety of boosting algorithms used to increase the weights of misclassified events @xcite .",
    "we describe here the commonly used discrete adaboost method @xcite .",
    "define the error rate for tree @xmath27 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 if event @xmath30 is correctly classified and @xmath31 if it is incorrectly classified .",
    "typically the first tree is trained with the same weight for all events . then adjust each of the event weights using @xmath32      \\\\ w_i & \\to & w_i \\times e^{\\alpha_m i_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "this increases the weights of misclassified events ; the weights are increased more when the tree has a low error rate .",
    "these new weights are then used to generate a new decision tree .",
    "the standard adaboost algorithm uses @xmath33 but",
    "this can be adjusted to vary how quickly the weights are updated with each iteration .    after generating @xmath34 individual trees with weights @xmath35 , the final classifier answer for an event described by a set of features",
    "@xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the result for tree @xmath27 : 0 if @xmath36 lands on a background leaf and + 1 for a signal leaf .",
    "the absolute normalization of @xmath39 is arbitrary ; we chose to renormalize the @xmath35 weights such that @xmath40 .",
    "random forests @xcite also generate multiple decision trees for a given training set and use a weighted average of the trees as the final decision metric .",
    "when training a tree , at each branch the training cycle only considers a random subset of the possible features available to use .",
    "this has the effect of washing out the typical training instabilities of decision trees and produces a classifier which is fast to train and robust against outliers .",
    "the support vector machine ( svm ) algorithm is a classification method that has successfully been applied to many pattern recognition problems and is founded on principles of statistical learning theory  @xcite .",
    "it nonlinearly maps data points from the original input space to a higher - dimensional feature space in which an optimal hyperplane parameterized by a normal vector @xmath15 and offset @xmath41 is computed such that the separation between events in different classes is maximized .",
    "the linear decision boundary is defined as @xmath42 , where @xmath36 is a vector in the feature space which describes objects and @xmath43 is a mapping which embeds the problem into a higher - dimensional space in which classes are more easily separable than in the original feature space .",
    "an optimization problem is constructed to find the unknown hyperplane parameters , and the optimal hyperplane normal @xmath15 is found to be entirely determined by the subset of events nearest to the optimal decision boundary ( also called support vectors , @xmath44 ) as follows : @xmath45 , where the coefficients @xmath46 are the lagrange multipliers used in solving the nonlinear optimization and are a byproduct of the optimization .",
    "the hyperplane parameters are solved by maximizing the margin ( the distance between the hyperplane and the example events in each class ) , which is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem , where the constraints enforce that examples from different classes lie on opposite sides of the hyperplane .",
    "the objective function to be minimized is convex , _",
    "i.e. _ , it is guaranteed to have a global minimum and no local minima .",
    "the linear decision boundary corresponds to a nonlinear ( and possibly disjoint ) decision boundary in the original feature space .",
    "once the hyperplane is found , a set of features @xmath36 is typically classified into one of the two classes by applying a threshold cut to @xmath47 .    rather than calculating @xmath48 explicitly while evaluating @xmath49 , the actual embedding is achieved through a kernel function defining an inner product in the embedding space , @xmath50 .",
    "this `` kernel trick '' makes class prediction easy to implement and fast to compute .",
    "several common kernel mappings are given in @xcite .",
    "in practice , the kernel function is typically chosen empirically via training and testing , and the simplest function giving the desired performance is used . the gaussian kernel used in this analysis @xmath51",
    "is commonly used because it only has one free parameter to be tuned ( @xmath52 ) and empirically performs as well as , if not better than , more complex kernels which may overfit the data .    for this analysis we used a soft - boundary svm method called @xmath53-svm , which handles noisy data with high class overlap by adding a regularization term to the objective function",
    "this term allows but penalizes training points lying on the wrong side of the decision boundary .",
    "the regularization parameter , @xmath53 , controls the trade - off between maximizing the separation and allowing some amount of training error while finding the hyperplane which maximally separates signal from background .",
    "the advantages of svms include the existence of a unique solution , the simple geometric interpretation of the margin maximization function , the capacity to compute arbitrary nonlinear decision boundaries while controlling over - fitting with soft margins , the low number of parameters to be tuned ( as few as two , depending on the choice of kernel ) , and the dependence of the solution on only a small number of data points ( the support vectors ) which define the boundary of the class separation hypersurface . for svm",
    "implementation details , see @xcite .",
    "artificial neural networks ( anns ) are a broad category of classification methods originally inspired by the interconnected structure of neurons and synapses in the brain .",
    "these methods map a set of input variables to one or more output results via one or more `` hidden layers '' of intermediate nodes . for a supernova search",
    ", the inputs would be the features describing each object and the desired output would be 1(0 ) for signal  ( background ) .",
    "for an overview of these methods , see @xcite .",
    "anns can be powerful classifiers and have been used in many applications , though they are slow to train and require some experimentation to optimize the number of hidden layers and nodes to match a given problem .",
    "they also do not scale well with an increasing number of input features , and their results become unstable when there are significant outliers or otherwise irrelevant input data .",
    "for these reasons , anns were not deemed to be an appropriate classification method for our dataset and this method was not pursued for this study .",
    "the nearby supernova factory @xcite search uses data from the near earth asteroid tracking ( neat ) program and the palomar quest consortium using the 112 ccd quest - ii camera @xcite on the palomar oschin 1.2-m telescope .",
    "the neat observing pattern obtains triplets of 60-second exposures spread over a time period of @xmath01 hour using a single rg610 filter , which is a long pass filter redward of 610 nm .",
    "this allows the search to distinguish between asteroids , whose motion is typically detectable on that timescale , and spatially static objects such as supernovae .",
    "the quest data are obtained in 4 filters in driftscan mode ; our search uses the two filters which cover the best quality ccds ( either bessel @xmath54 and @xmath55 or gunn @xmath56 and @xmath30 depending upon camera configuration ) .",
    "the quest data cover less area and tend to be cosmetically cleaner than the neat data , resulting in fewer spurious detections overall . since the false positive background events are much worse in the neat data , our study of alternative classification methods has focused on the neat dataset .",
    "coadded stacks of images taken from 2000 to 2003 are used as references .",
    "the new and reference images are convolved to match their point - spread - functions ( psfs ) , the fluxes are normalized by matching stars , and the reference is subtracted from the new images .",
    "objects in the subtraction are identified based upon contiguous pixels with @xmath57 with at least one pixel with @xmath5 .",
    "objects are described by features such as position , full - width - half - max ( fwhm ) in @xmath58 and @xmath59 , aperture photometry and associated uncertainties in 3 apertures , distance to nearest object in the reference coadd , and measures of the roundness and irregularity of the object contour based upon fourier descriptors @xcite .",
    "additional features are formed as combinations of features from the same object observed on multiple images .",
    "combined features include the object motion between two images and the consistency of the statistical significance of the measurements in different images .",
    "the features are used by a classification method ( originally threshold cuts , more recently boosted decision trees ) to select supernova candidates of interest which are then visually scanned by humans to select the best candidates for spectroscopic confirmation and followup by the supernova integral field spectrometer ( snifs ) @xcite , on the university of hawaii 2.2-m telescope on mauna kea .",
    "to generate signal events for training , fake supernovae were introduced into the images by moving real stars of a desired magnitude to locations distributed about known galaxies on the snfactory search images . by using real stars from the same images as the galaxies , we realistically model the point - spread - function , noise , and possible image artifacts present in that image .",
    "these images with fake supernovae were processed with the same data analysis pipeline as real images to identify objects and measure their features for classification .",
    "the stars are sampled in a circular region of 20 pixels in diameter .",
    "the typical fwhm of stars on these images is about 3 pixels , so this samples the psf out to @xmath60 .",
    "the average sky level of the image is subtracted from the sampled pixels before they are added in the new location , which implicitely assumes that the sky level is uniform over the image .",
    "this is valid in most cases , and it is simple to reject fakes created from cases that violate this assumption . typically these fakes will have a fwhm that differs very significantly from the average ( @xmath020 pixels vs. @xmath03 ) .",
    "most stars are sufficiently isolated that they do not bring along portions of other objects , and we identify and reject cases where this does happen .",
    "the spatial variation of the psf is minimal compared to the night - to - night variations which much be addressed by the image subtraction pipeline , thus this fake supernova generation procedure does not attempt to correct for the small spatial variations of the psf across the ccd .",
    "background events were randomly selected from 4.1 million other objects identified on the subtractions with fake supernovae .",
    "these subtractions covered a month of data taking including bright and dark times and a variety of seeing conditions .",
    "objects within 20 pixels of a fake supernova were excluded to avoid any artifacts which might be introduced through an ill - formed fake .",
    "these background events form a randomly selected subset of the genuine backgrounds faced by the supernova search in the real data , and thus represent the real fractions of each type of background event faced .",
    "the signal and background samples were split into training and validation subsets .",
    "several training sets were formed with 5,000 signal and 5,000 background events each .",
    "the final validation was performed using 20,000 signal and 200,000 background events .",
    "the training dataset for the support vector machine method was augmented with real supernova discoveries in an attempt to improve its overall performance .",
    "the original training set used 19 features ; an additional 13 features were then added which improved the performance of the boosted trees and random forests but decreased the performance of the svm .",
    "the results shown in  [ sec : comparison ] are for the best performance achieved for each classifier ( _ i.e. _ , using 19 features for svm and 32 features for the other methods ) .",
    "for fisher discriminant analysis , boosted trees , and random forests , we used the open - source c++ software package statpatternrecognition . training a set of 200 boosted trees using 10,000 training events with 19 features each with a minimum leaf size of 15 events . ]",
    "takes @xmath03 minutes ( wallclock ) on a 2 ghz amd opteron cpu .",
    "training with 32 features takes @xmath045 minutes .",
    "once the trees are trained , it takes approximately 0.6 ms ( wallclock ) to evaluate the results for an object .",
    "random forests took less than 2 minutes to train on the dataset with 32 features , using the same parameters as above .",

    "evaluating the svm on a new data point takes approximately 0.6 ms ( wallclock ) .",
    "in the end , most classification methods produce a single classification statistic with arbitrary normalization which rates how signal - like or how background - like the candidate is . a threshold cut on this statistic",
    "can be used to select a subsample of events with desired signal _ vs. _  background purity . a useful way to visualize",
    "the power of a classifier is to plot the fraction of false positives ( _ i.e. _ , background events incorrectly classified as signal ) _",
    "vs_.  fraction of true positives ( _ i.e. _ , signal events correctly identified ) for various selection values on the classification statistic .",
    "figure [ fig : eff ] shows the performance of several classification methods applied to the snfactory dataset .",
    "the red square shows the performance of the original threshold cuts upon which we were working to improve .",
    "the curves show that svm , random forests , and boosted trees all performed dramatically better than the threshold cuts across a wide range of signal and background efficiencies .",
    "the object features in our data have significant outliers which prevented fisher discriminant analysis from being a useful classification method .",
    "the overall best performance was obtained using boosted decision trees , with random forests providing nearly as good performance with faster training and evaluation times .",
    "although svm performed considerably better than threshold cuts , it was not as successful as random forests or boosted trees .",
    "a possible explanation is that the svm proved to be more sensitive to signal events that lie close to background events in the feature space , and could not strike a balance between modeling such events _",
    "vs_.  overfitting to noise .",
    "for example , a dim young supernova on a bright galaxy can be very similar to a statistical fluctuation or a modest subtraction error in the images .",
    "robustness against overfitting is a known strength of boosted classifiers @xcite , and the issue of overfitting noisy data is an area of active research within the machine learning community .",
    "further details of applying svm to the snfactory dataset are described in @xcite .    boosted trees , random forests , and svm successfully reduced the false - positive rate for all types of background events in our data .",
    "the three most common remaining background types are faint optical ghosts from scattered light , fluctuations in charge trails from bright stars due to ccd charge transfer inefficiency , and leftover dipoles from subtracting astrometrically misaligned objects",
    ". the optical ghosts can be genuinely difficult to distinguish from dim supernovae near our detection threshold .",
    "the charge trails and dipoles are easy to distinguish by eye but we currently do not have specific features which directly address these two backgrounds , thus all classification methods have difficulty with them , given the input features currently available .",
    "these backgrounds are somewhat described by a roundness feature and comparison of the flux in small _",
    "vs_.  large apertures .",
    "adding features to directly address these backgrounds would improve the power of any classification method .",
    "projects with higher quality ccds and optical designs to minimize scattered light will naturally have fewer backgrounds as well .",
    "the optimum selection criterion is dependent upon the tradeoff between true positive selection efficiency ( horizontal axis ) and the false positive selection efficiency ( vertical axis ) . at the snfactory",
    "we seek to maximize our signal efficiency within the realistic constraints of the personnel and telescope time available to vet false positives . for the fall 2006 search ,",
    "we used boosted decision trees and choose a point with 10 times less background than we had previously faced .",
    "this corresponds to an average efficiency of @xmath078% for identification of a supernova with a single filter and one night of imaging .      since boosted trees provided the best classification performance",
    ", we describe here how the performance changed with various input parameters to the boosted tree training .",
    "the performance of boosted trees depends upon the number of trees generated and the amount of branching which is done before finishing each tree .    for controlling the amount of branching per tree",
    ", the statpatternrecognition package has an adjustable limit on minimum number of events per leaf in the final tree .",
    "our training sample contained 5,000 signal and 5,000 background events .",
    "we found the best performance with a minimum leaf size of 15 events , which results in a set of boosted trees with 250300 leaves each .",
    "figure [ fig : nperleaf ] shows the relative performance of 200 trees with a mininum leaf size of @xmath61 relative to the @xmath62 case .",
    "figure [ fig : ntree ] shows the relative performance of @xmath63 trees in comparison to the @xmath64 case , using a minimum leaf size of 50 events . for the fall 2006 snfactory supernova search we choose to use 200 trees with a minimum of 15 events per leaf out of the 10,000 training events .",
    "as expected , the various methods provided correlated output ; _ i.e. _ , events ranked highly by one classifier tended to be ranked highly by another . but even through boosted trees provided the best classification performance overall , there were good signal events which were found by svm which were missed by the boosted trees ( for a given set of thresholds on the svm and boosted tree outputs ) .",
    "we attempted to recover these events by combining the output of these two methods .",
    "several combinations were tried :    * keep events which passed thresholds for either classifier . *",
    "perform fisher discriminant analysis on the output of the two classifiers .",
    "* split the svm _ vs. _  boosted tree output space into sub - regions of signal and background .",
    "this is conceptually similar to forming a decision tree in this 2d space and accounts for non - linear correlations in the svm _ vs. _",
    "boosted tree output .",
    "* use the output of svm as an additional feature input for boosted trees .",
    "none of these methods produced results which outperformed the boosted trees alone .",
    "although the combined classifiers could identify signal events which would have been missed by just one classifier , the combination also brought in an increased number of background events such that the overall performance was the same or worse than the boosted trees alone .",
    "this result is not generally true , however .",
    "in other contexts , multiple classifiers have been successfully combined to produce overall more powerful results @xcite .",
    "this work has shown a variety of object classification methods which provide significantly better performance than is possible with the method of threshold cuts used by most current supernova searches .",
    "the implementations studied here used common defaults , such as using the gini parameter for optimizing boosted decision trees and the gaussian kernel for svm .",
    "there are many variations of these methods , some of which might provide further improved performance . but even these `` out of the box '' implementations with minimal tuning provided much better performance than threshold cuts .",
    "any classifier will be limited by the quality and power of the input features provided . in practice , after an initial round of training and validation , one should study the misclassified events and introduce additional features that distinguish these .",
    "such iterations are helpful regardless of which classification method is used ; the main point of this work is to point to new classification methods which will maximize the classification power possible given a set of features .    as with any analysis , there is no substitute for clean data and a well understood detector .",
    "problems which arise from false - positive detections should first be addressed at the level of the detector and data processing pipeline .",
    "future projects will hopefully have the resources to address spurious detections at this level to make the process easier for their object classifiers .",
    "but even high quality , well understood detectors and advanced image processing pipelines such as sdss will face signal _ vs_.  background classification problems , and",
    "this is where the methods described in this paper come into play .",
    "in addition to improved background rejection power , these new methods also have the advantage of generating a single number which ranks the quality of an object rather than a boolean pass / fail decision .",
    "one may then adjust a threshold cut on that single number to tune the desired tradeoff between purity and completeness .",
    "future surveys may publish transient alerts using relatively loose quality requirements ; subscribers to these alerts can then place their own cuts on this quality rank to adjust the purity , completeness , and input data rate as needed .    boosted trees , random forests , and support vector machines all provide much better object classification performance than traditional threshold cuts . when applied to the snfactory supernova search pipeline , boosted trees enabled us to find more supernovae with less work : our efficiency for finding real supernovae increased while our workload for scanning non - supernova objects dramatically decreased .",
    "methods such as these will be crucial for maintaining reasonable false positive rates at the automated transient alert pipelines of upcoming projects such as panstarrs and lsst .",
