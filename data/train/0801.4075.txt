    "nowadays , there is a large amount of theoretical and experimental work , studying new phases of strongly correlated fermionic systems that spontaneously break rotational and/or translational symmetry .",
    "these electronic states were called _ quantum liquids crystals_@xcite because they are anisotropic metals sharing the same symmetry properties as usual liquid crystals . today , we have several examples of smectic@xcite and nematic@xcite quantum liquid phases .",
    "it is interesting that , at mesoscopic scale , we can understand the basic physics of these phases just on symmetry grounds , without relying on the detailed microscopic description . of course , the final fate of the phase depends on thermal and/or quantum fluctuations , and on dimensionality .",
    "the quantum nematic state is probably the best candidate@xcite to explain the anisotropies observed in 2deg at half filled landau levels@xcite .",
    "this state is also expected to appear in other strongly correlated systems like high @xmath0 superconductors@xcite and in heavy fermion compounds@xcite .",
    "the first consistent description of the quantum nematic state was done in ref . , and its nonperturbative one - particle properties were studied in ref . .",
    "several important results were obtained in the case of the two - dimensional isotropic - nematic quantum phase transition@xcite . at criticality ,",
    "the low energy properties are ruled by a dissipative collective cubic mode @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling of this mode with fermions wipes off the quasi - particle pole in the spectral functions ( except for some symmetrical points ) , implying that the isotropic - nematic transition , from the electronic point of view , is a fermi / non - fermi liquid phase transition .",
    "these calculations , initially done in hartree - fock approximation@xcite , were confirmed with a nonperturbative treatment of the pomeranchuk instability , using multidimensional bosonization , @xcite and with the more usual landau theory of fermi liquids@xcite .    in recent years",
    ", there was an increasing interest on pomeranchuk instabilities@xcite not only in continuous models but also in the lattice@xcite .",
    "concerning quantum hall samples at moderate magnetic fields , there is experimental evidence@xcite and theoretical proposals@xcite pointing to the idea that a huge number of phases are present , which depend on the filling factor and temperature , that is , a rich and delicate competition between several liquid states ( metallic ) and crystal states ( insulators ) .",
    "very near integer filling factor , a wigner crystal state is by now well established@xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuations of this state could melt the crystal into an hexatic phase , which is homogeneous and anisotropic , with the residual symmetry of the wigner triangular lattice .",
    "increasing fluctuations would produce more disorder , leading to an hexatic / isotropic transition .",
    "there is a clear region in the phase diagram where the isotropic , nematic and hexatic phases compete very closely@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to characterize this quantum phase transition as a first step to understand real hall liquids .    in order to simplify ,",
    "we study a version of landau theory for spinless fermi liquids@xcite , where we consider the effect of the curvature of the fermionic dispersion relation@xcite around the fermi surface and possibly four - body interactions .",
    "in particular , we analyze quantum fluctuations in a region where the landau parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 are very near the pomeranchuk instability .",
    "the main results are depicted in figure ( [ figbp ] ) , where we draw a mean field phase diagram for the fermi liquid in terms of the landau parameters .",
    "we clearly see two second order lines , corresponding to the isotropic / nematic and the isotropic / hexatic phase transitions .",
    "these transitions meet together at a bi - critical point where a first order nematic / hexatic transition emerges .    along the two second order lines ,",
    "the nematic and hexatic order parameters are weakly coupled and we expect a similar behavior of these two phases .",
    "however , very near the bi - critical point the coupling is very strong and it is not possible to distinguish between nematic and hexatic fluctuations .",
    "we find that the critical theory _ at the bicritical point _ is governed by a low lying collective mode with dynamical exponent @xmath4 .",
    "we also found that , in the symmetry broken phase , the orientations of the nematic and hexatic principal axes are not independent , they differ by specific angles dictated by symmetry . in the two ordered phases ,",
    "the goldstone mode associated with the angle fluctuation is also a dissipative cubic mode , retaining the criticality of the theory deep inside the two symmetry broken phases . near the bicritical point , they are separated by a discontinuous transition and the dynamics in this region is related with metastability .    in the next sections we show the details of the model and the main reasoning leading to the above mentioned results .",

    "in order to simplify , we have considered the same @xmath15 for the quartic terms associated with both order parameters , however , we could allow different values without changing any substantial physics .",

    ", the free energy is very similar to that occurring in several antiferromagnetic systems with weak anisotropy@xcite and presents in general multicritical points .",

    "when @xmath40 switch to negative values , different types of solutions emerge , depending on the other parameters of the model .",
    "for instance , for @xmath41 , and for any value of @xmath17 , we find the solution @xmath42 , @xmath43 . on the other hand , if @xmath44 , for any value of @xmath18 , the solution is @xmath45 , @xmath46 .",
    "these solutions determine two second order phase transitions : isotropic / nematic and isotropic / hexatic , in the @xmath47 , @xmath39 and @xmath38 , @xmath48 semi - axis , respectively , see figs .",
    "[ figtp ] and [ figbp ]",
    ".    if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are negative , there are in addition new solutions where both order parameters are different from zero , @xmath49 which of all these extrema are absolute minima depends essentially on the relative values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath52 , the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ mix1 ] ) and ( [ mix2 ] ) are valid in the region @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , the straight lines @xmath54 and @xmath55 determine the two second order phase transitions shown in fig .",
    "[ figtp ] . inside this region , the pure nematic and the pure hexatic solutions become unstable , leading to a coexistence phase , where the two order parameters are different from zero .",
    "this region is possible due to the @xmath21 symmetry , which makes the phases of the two order parameters independent .",
    "notice that the region of coexistence is controlled by the coupling @xmath51 between the two order parameters .",
    "if @xmath56 , they decouple and this region covers the complete third quadrant , as it should be . for higher @xmath51 , the region is stretched between the two lines shown in fig .",
    "[ figtp ] , and for the limiting value @xmath57 , the area of coexistence shrinks to zero , and the second order transition collapses into a first order one , valid in the case of @xmath58 , this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ figbp ] .    if @xmath59 , the solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ mix1 ] ) and ( [ mix2 ] ) ( valid now in the region @xmath60 ) are unstable , and the true ground state is the pure nematic and the pure hexatic solution , separated by a first order line ( see fig . [ figbp ] ) .",
    "now , let us analyze the @xmath61 case . if @xmath19 is large enough , the system will present unstable directions in the @xmath62 plane , invalidating the quartic expansion of the free energy . moreover , it is not difficult to realize that there is a critical value @xmath63 bellow which the theory is stable , in the case of having @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "as we mentioned , an important effect of the @xmath19 term is to reduce the symmetry of the model from @xmath23 establishing a relationship between the relative phases of the two order parameters ; a direct consequence is that the coexisting phase of fig .",
    "[ figtp ] is now a nematic one , since we can not freely change the phases independently . on the other hand ,",
    "the term @xmath66 does not change the character of the phase transition we have described .",
    "therefore , in fig . [ figtp ] , the lines remain as second order transitions , except that we should consider now the coexisting phase as a nematic one .",
    "in the case @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "[ figbp ] ) , we will still have two second order lines , and a first order line between the nematic and hexatic phases .",
    "the explicit solutions can be evaluated pertubatively in @xmath19 .    to be more precise , for the case @xmath58 ,",
    "the isotropic and hexatic phases are the same as those we have described for @xmath20 . however , when @xmath44 and @xmath39 , @xmath27 assumes a value of order @xmath19 given by , @xmath67 we are tempted to interpret this as a coexisting phase , however , as stated before , we are not allowed to change the phases of the two order parameters independently .",
    "then , the residual symmetry is the nematic one and the global phase is nematic with higher harmonics .",
    "this solution remains the global minimum deep inside the @xmath41 region , when it finds the first order line depicted in fig .",
    "[ figbp ] , and jumps discontinuously to the pure hexatic phase .",
    "therefore , the main effect of the @xmath19 term is to slightly modify the first order line @xmath68 and to add higher harmonics to the nematic solution .",
    "as we have discussed , this term is also responsible for the relative alignment between the principal axes of the nematic and hexatic phases .",
    "of course , this analysis is only valid very near the multicritical point where the order parameters are small .",
    "note that the different phases are separated by straight lines just because we are calculating at leading order in the order parameters .",
    "we expect that higher order corrections , as well as fluctuations , will curve this lines as occurs when studying multicritical behavior in anisotropic antiferromagnets@xcite . however , the character of the phase transitions will not change .    an important point to discuss",
    "is whether this mean field phase diagram survives fluctuations or not . in the case of classical systems",
    ", thermal fluctuations will turn the second order phase transitions into kosterlitz - thouless@xcite type ones .",
    "the reason is that the angular correlations have logarithmic divergences that destroy the real order of the phase , keeping a quasi - long - range - order in the correlations@xcite .",
    "we expect that the first - oder transition will be more robust against fluctuations , keeping its discontinuous character or possibly becoming slightly rounded .    at @xmath69 ,",
    "quantum fluctuations depend on the dynamics of the goldstone modes associated with the spontaneously broken symmetry . in the case of fermi liquids",
    ", we will show in the next sections that fluctuations of the nematic and hexatic order parameters provide a dynamical exponent @xmath4 , implying an effective dimension equal to five , above the upper critical dimension .",
    "therefore , the order of the transitions studied at mean field is expected to be valid in the quantum case .",
    "we consider a spinless fermi liquid with an initially circular fermi surface@xcite .",
    "interactions between quasi - particles can be written in terms of an effective action of the form , @xmath70 here , @xmath71 is the density of states at the fermi surface , @xmath72 and @xmath73 label patches defined by coarse graining the fermi surface , and the density fluctuations of quasi - particles in each patch is given by @xmath74 .",

    "that means that in the isotropic phase , where the quadratic part is positive definite , the quartic term will not influence the asymptotic correlation functions ( besides renormalization of the parameters of the model ) , obtaining the usual correlations associated with landau fermi liquids .",
    "however , near a pomeranchuk instability , the quartic term is responsible for the stabilization of the anisotropic phases discussed in this article@xcite .",

    "on the broken symmetry side of the transition the theory continues to be critical due to dissipative cubic goldstone modes .",
    "these modes are proportional to the `` range '' @xmath130 of the non - local landau parameters .",
    "therefore , even though the ordered phases exist for local interactions , they have zero stiffness , making them pathological . in this sense , although the non - locality of the two - body coupling is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , it must be taken into account to correctly compute fluctuations .",
