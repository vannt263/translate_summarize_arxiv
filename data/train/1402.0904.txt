    "in this section we briefly describe an improved and simplified version of the arguments from @xcite and compare the resulting improved estimates to the ones from the previous section . following the general approach we employ in this work , the arguments are presented for general centrally  symmetric convex bodies , and",
    "this in fact further simplifies the exposition of @xcite .        for the proof of theorem [ th : projzq - main ] , we use a sort of converse to carl s theorem ( [ eq : carl ] ) on the diameter of sections of a convex body satisfying @xmath193-regular entropy estimates , which is due to v. milman @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",

    "consequently , a significantly improved estimate is obtained by employing lemma [ lem : milman - m*-covering ] ( and the subsequent remark ) which exploits this regularity : @xmath324 even with this improvement , note that this is where the current approach incurs some unnecessary logarithmic price with respect to the approach in the previous sections : instead of using ( [ eq : compare1 ] ) directly , one uses ( [ eq : compare2 ] ) which pisier obtains from ( [ eq : compare1 ] ) by applying carl s theorem , and then uses the converse to carl s theorem ( lemma [ lem : milman - m*-covering ] ) to pass back to gelfand number estimates .      the rest of the proof is identical to that of theorem [ thm : main - s ] . for the ellipsoid @xmath327",

    "having obtained a rather regular estimate on the gelfand numbers , the next goal is to obtain an entropy estimate . to this end",
    ", one can use carl s theorem ( [ eq : carl ] ) or ( [ eq : carl2 ] ) , as we do in section [ sec : diam ] .",
    "the approach in @xcite proceeds by employing an entropy extension theorem of litvak , v. milman , pajor and tomczak - jaegermann @xcite .",
    "we remark that this too may be avoided , by employing the following elementary covering estimate ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 9 ) ) :    [ lem:6.5.3 ] let @xmath0 be a symmetric convex body in @xmath55 and assume that @xmath334 for some @xmath335 .",
