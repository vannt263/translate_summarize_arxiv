    "in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the higgs field @xcite provides the mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking and the origin of masses of the fundamental particles , but until recently the higgs boson itself left no signal in high - energy collider experiments .",
    "the situation has clearly changed , however , as both the atlas @xcite and cms @xcite collaborations have announced observation of a bosonic particle at about the @xmath2 significance level .",
    "the excess is driven by the two channels with the highest mass resolution @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the equally sensitive but low resolution @xmath5 channel . assuming the boson spin is shown to be zero",
    ", these results will provide conclusive evidence for the discovery of a higgs - like scalar particle with mass @xmath6 for atlas and @xmath7 for cms .",
    "the discovery points to a favored mass range : @xmath8 , which is in agreement with the indirect detections from the electroweak precision constraints , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it fixes the one remaining free parameter in the sm : the higgs self - coupling @xmath10 .. ] however , this low higgs mass immediately leads to the problem of the sm higgs vacuum stability which requires @xmath10 remain positive at all scales @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath10 becomes negative at some scale , the potential is either unbounded from below and has no state of minimum energy or has a vacuum with lower energy for the case where @xmath10 may run positive again at an even higher scale . given @xmath12 , the higgs self - coupling @xmath10 may run negative at a scale below the planck scale  @xcite , necessitating new physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that absolute vacuum stability requires a higgs mass @xmath13 , by using a partial two - loop matching and three - loop renormalization group running procedure and taking into account the existing @xmath14 experimental uncertainties in the mass of the top quark and @xmath15 .",
    "a very similar conclusion was given in ref .",
    "additionally , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the two - loop qcd and yukawa corrections to the relation between the higgs quartic coupling and the higgs mass so as to reduce the uncertainty in the determination of the higgs mass from @xmath16 .",
    "the authors claimed that while @xmath10 at the planck scale is zero , the absolute stability of the sm higgs potential is excluded at @xmath17 c.l . for @xmath18 .",
    "thus a @xmath19124 - 126  gev higgs strongly points to new physics in the desert between the fermi and planck scales .",
    "supersymmetry and extra dimension models may provide solutions to this problem , but up to now no clear signals of such new physics have emerged from collider searches . therefore it is instructive to consider alternative simple extensions of the sm that can alleviate the vacuum stability problem .    despite the absence of collider bsm signals , definitive evidence of new physics beyond the sm comes from several additional sources , including neutrino masses and dark matter .",
    "the solar , atmospheric , reactor , and accelerator neutrino experiments have provided convincing evidence that neutrinos are massive and lepton flavors are mixed @xcite .",
    "precise cosmological observations have confirmed the existence of non - baryonic cold dark matter with an abundance of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "these two important discoveries can not be accommodated in the sm without introducing extra ingredients .",
    "doing so can affect the stability of the electroweak vacuum _ via _ one or more of the following interactions : ( 1 ) additional quartic scalar interactions associated with new scalar degrees of freedom ; ( 2 ) yukawa interactions associated with neutrino mass generation ; ( 3 ) modified or extended gauge interactions appearing in neutrino mass and/or dark matter models .    in this work ,",
    "we study examples of all three . in particular , to understand the origin of the neutrino masses , one may extend the sm with heavy majorana neutrinos so that light neutrino masses can be generated through the so - called seesaw mechanism .",
    "there are three types of tree - level seesaw mechanisms , categorized according to the particle content of their extension to the sm : heavy majorana neutrinos ( type - i @xcite ) plus either a @xmath21 higgs triplet ( type - ii @xcite ) or a @xmath22 fermion triplet ( type - iii @xcite ) ( @xmath23 is the sm hypercharge quantum number ) . in the context of type - i models ,",
    "the impact of heavy right - handed neutrinos , @xmath24 , on the sm higgs vacuum stability and metastability scales was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , with the result that the @xmath25 decrease the higgs vacuum stability scale . in this paper",
    "we will study the effect of a tev scale type - ii seesaw model on the higgs vacuum stability .",
    "our result shows that the the sm higgs vacuum can remain stable up to the planck scale for certain chosen parameters of the type - ii seesaw model .",
    "we also study how to keep the sm higgs vacuum stable by making changes only to the gauge interactions . in the context of the sm gauge groups , stability up to the planck scale",
    "can be restored by introducing a series of new electroweak multiplets , the neutral component of which may serve as the cold dark matter candidate . the presence of these multiplets may significantly alter the renormalization group ( rg ) evolution of the gauge coupling coefficients and thus indirectly keep the sm higgs vacuum stable up to the planck scale .",
    "we also study the implications of the sm higgs vacuum stability for a new gauge symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that there are only flavor - dependent anomaly - free gauged @xmath1 symmetries in the minimal sm . in the sm with three right - handed neutrinos and a scalar singlet , there is another well - known anomaly - free gauged @xmath1 symmetry : @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "however , the sm higgs boson carries no new @xmath1 charge in both cases .",
    "the presence of these new @xmath1 symmetries only affects the running behavior of the yukawa couplings ( most notably that of the top quark ) . in this paper , we study the effect of a new type of @xmath1 gauge symmetry in which the sm higgs boson carries non - zero charge .",

    "we summarize in section v. expressions for the relevant @xmath27-functions appear in the appendix .",

    "this bound is essentially equivalent to the requirement that the quartic higgs coupling @xmath16 never becomes negative at any scale @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the scale of new physics . in this paper",
    "we will study numerically the impact of representative simple bsm scenarios on the vacuum stability of a @xmath19124 - 126 gev sm higgs . as a sm baseline",

    "contributions of bsm physics are considered at the one - loop level .",
    "the resulting stability requirements for a given bsm scenario are likely to be overly conservative , since the three - loop analyses tend to alleviate the tension of a 124 - 126 gev higgs with stability . however , since we do not presently have in hand the two - loop running for the bsm scenarios , it may not make sense to consider the sm at the three - loop and the bsm at the one - loop .",

    "the horizontal band is the currently measured value of the higgs mass .",
    "it is evident from the figure that the sm higgs vacuum stability predicts that @xmath132 should be roughly larger than @xmath91 in this specific model , though a smaller value could also be viable if the impact of the singlet scalar - higgs coupling is included .",

    "a detailed analysis of the collider signatures of the model will be presented in future work .",
    "if the observed @xmath153 gev boson is , indeed , the higgs boson , then stability of the sm electroweak vacuum up to the planck scale may require that some bsm degrees of freedom become active at scales @xmath154 1 tev .",
    "the presence of these degrees of freedom can modify the rg evolution of the higgs quartic self - interaction that may otherwise run negative below the planck scale .",
    "in general , three ingredients may change the running behavior of the higgs self - coupling : four - scalar interactions , yukawa interactions , and gauge interactions . in this paper , we have studied the sm higgs vacuum stability problem in representative minimal extensions of the sm that also address other phenomenological problems , accounting for the neutrino masses , dark matter from ew multiplets , and a new gauge symmetry .",
    "we find that vacuum stability of a @xmath19124 - 126  gev higgs up to the planck scale could point to the existence of new scalars , which might be a tev scale higgs triplet in the type - ii seesaw model , whose coupling @xmath74 with the sm higgs should be in the rather restricted range @xmath155 .",
    "alternatively , stability could be achieved through existence of a series of tev - scale ew multiplets , which can be gauge - portal dark matter candidates , or to a new @xmath122 gauge symmetry , in which the sm higgs carries non - zero charge . in the former case",
    ", the number of new particles should be relatively large , _",

    "if the new @xmath1 symmetry is broken at the @xmath156 scale , then the sm higgs vacuum stability implies that @xmath132 can not be arbitrarily small unless the couplings of the associated sm singlets to the higgs doublet , the number of singlets , or the singlet @xmath122 charge is sufficiently large .",
