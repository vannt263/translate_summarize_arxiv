    "in 1964 , j.s . bell proved the result now known as bell s theorem : any physical theory of a certain type must make predictions ( for a certain class of experiment ) which respect a so - called bell inequality .",
    "quantum mechanics ( qm ) predicts violations of the inequality , and subsequent experiments establish convincingly ( though not without loopholes ) that the quantum mechanical predictions are correct ",
    "i.e. , the experiments establish that the type of theory bell showed must respect the inequality , can not be empirically viable , i.e. , can not be true .",
    "but the question ( which has given rise to an enormous literature ) remains : what type of theory is it , exactly , that bell s theorem ( combined with the associated experiments ) refutes ?",
    "bell s own view , expressed already in the opening lines of his 1964 paper and subsequently clarified and defended in virtually all of his later writings , was that `` it is the requirement of locality ... that creates the essential difficulty . ''",
    "( bell , 1964 , p. 14 ) by `` locality '' bell here means the prohibition , usually taken to be an implication of special relativity ( sr ) , of super - luminal ( faster than light ) causation .",
    "bell thus took his own theorem to establish a troubling conflict between ( the empirically verified predictions of ) qm ( i.e. , between _ experiment _ ) and sr :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` for me then this is the real problem with quantum theory : the apparently essential conflict between any sharp formulation and fundamental relativity .",

    "most practicing physicists , however , ( and most philosophers of physics ) have disagreed with bell and continued to believe in the unproblematic consistency of qm and sr . where do they think bell went wrong ?    one can divide reasons for disagreement ( with bell s own interpretation of the significance of his theorem ) into two classes . first , there are those who assert that the derivation of a bell inequality relies not just on the premise of locality , but on some additional premises as well .",
    "the usual suspects here include realism , hidden variables , determinism , and counter - factual - definiteness .",
    "( note that the items on this list are highly overlapping , and often commentators use them interchangeably . )",
    "the idea is then that , since it is only the _ conjunction _ of locality with some other premise which is in conflict with experiment , and since locality is so strongly motivated by sr , we should reject the other premise . hence the widespread reports that bell s theorem finally refutes the hidden variables program , the principle of determinism , the philosophical notion of realism , etc .    here",
    "is how bell responded to this first class of disagreement :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` my own first paper on this subject ... starts with a summary of the epr argument _ from locality to _ deterministic hidden variables .",
    "but the commentators have almost universally reported that it begins with deterministic hidden variables . ''",
    "( bell , 1981 , p. 157 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    here ( a footnote , but also in the main text of the article in question ) bell goes out of his way to stress the overall logical structure of his _ two - part _ argument : first , an argument _ from _ locality and certain predictions of qm ( namely , perfect anti - correlation for parallel spin measurements on a pair of spin 1/2 particles in the spin singlet state ) _ to _ the existence of deterministic local hidden variables ; and then second , from such variables to the inequality , i.e. , to a disagreement with certain other predictions of qm .",
    "this whole first class of disagreement with bell , then , rests on a simple confusion about bell s argument .",
    "the more interesting and more subtle second class of disagreement includes those who accept that the empirically - violated bell inequality can be derived from bell s locality condition alone , but who argue that this locality condition is _ too strong _ ,",
    "i.e. , that it smuggles in some extra requirements beyond those minimally necessary to respect sr s prohibition on superluminal causation . at the head of this class",
    "is jon jarrett , whose 1983 phd thesis and subsequent 1984 paper argued that bell s own local causality condition ( which jarrett calls `` strong locality '' ) is logically equivalent to the conjunction of two subsidiary conditions , which jarrett described respectively as `` locality '' and `` completeness . ''    roughly speaking , jarrett s `` locality '' is the requirement that the outcome of a measurement on one particle be independent of the type of measurement performed ( at spacelike separation ) on a second particle ( which , in the interesting sorts of cases , is described by qm as being entangled with the first particle ) . jarrett s `` completeness '' on the other hand requires the outcome of the first measurement to be independent of the outcome of the second , spacelike separated measurement .",
    "he then argues that a violation of `` locality '' would entail the ability to send superluminal signals ( alice could learn something about the setting of bob s measurement device by examining the outcome of her own experiment ) which would allow bob to transmit a signal across a spacelike interval , something clearly forbidden by sr .",
    "by contrast , a violation of `` completeness '' indicates no conflict with sr .",
    "thus , jarrett argues , in the face of the empirical data conflicting with `` strong locality '' we may reject `` completeness '' and thereby achieve  contra bell  a kind of peaceful coexistence between qm and sr .",
    "jarrett s project has been widely hailed and widely discussed .",
    "it was the immediate stimulus for almost everything in the `` bell literature '' for about a decade after its appearance , and continues to set a broadly influential context for much ongoing work in this area .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to critically assess jarrett s analysis and the conclusions it led him to , by comparing his project side - by - side with bell s own discussions of the relevant issues . in particular",
    ", i will claim that jarrett simply missed a crucial aspect ( having something to do with `` completeness '' ) of bell s formulation of local causality ; this turns out to be the heart of the thinking behind jarrett s ( _ prima facie _ rather puzzling ) terminology for his two sub - conditions , as well as his central claim that violations of his `` completeness '' criterion indicate no conflict with special relativistic local causality .",
    "the main conclusion is thus that , contrary to jarrett and his followers , bell s own local causality criterion is in no sense `` too strong . '' and this of course undermines the attempt to establish the peaceful coexistence of qm and sr , i.e. , it supports bell s own interpretation of the meaning of his theorem .",
    "the following two sections present , respectively , bell s own ( final and most careful ) formulation of the locality premise , and then jarrett s analysis .",
    "section iv includes some comparative discussion , highlighting especially the relation of jarrett s thinking to the epr argument .",
    "a brief final section then summarizes and concludes .    before launching into this , however , it is appropriate to briefly survey earlier criticisms of jarrett s analysis of bell s locality concept . to my knowledge ,",
    "the fullest critical discussion of jarrett s project is in maudlin s book .",
    "maudlin s main points _ vis - a - vis _ jarrett are as follows : ( a ) jarrett s identification of his `` locality '' sub - condition with the prohibition on superluminal signals is wrong ; ( b ) jarrett s identification of superluminal signaling with superluminal causation is wrong ; ( c ) jarrett s claim that a violation of his `` completeness '' condition does not entail any nonlocal causation is wrong .    the arguments for ( a ) and ( b ) are made clearly and compellingly by maudlin , who thus really demolishes jarrett s erroneous identification of his `` locality '' with the relevant requirements of sr .",
    "but the case for ( c ) is made only indirectly , essentially by dismissing jarrett and re - asserting bell s claim to the contrary .",
    "so , to be a bit more precise about the goal of the present paper , the aim is to fill this gap by exploring in detail how jarrett s `` completeness '' condition relates to bell s local causality criterion and how jarrett s misunderstanding of the latter led him to the various erroneous conclusions .",
    "i should note at the outset , however , that the view to be presented here as jarrett s is almost certainly a bit misleading as to his ( or those i consider his followers ) fully - considered views .",
    "jarrett does actually say all the things i attribute to him , but my gloss will perhaps minimize the extent to which jarrett ( i would argue , inconsistently ) also acknowledges points in conflict with the views i will attribute to him .",
    "it is probably best , therefore , to understand the `` jarrett '' discussed here as a rhetorically clarifying construct , which may or may not correspond to the views of the actual jon jarrett .",

    "we will here essentially follow that discussion , supplementing it occasionally with things from his earlier papers .",
    "bell first introduces what he calls the `` principle of local causality '' as follows : `` the direct causes ( and effects ) of events are near by , and even the indirect causes ( and effects ) are no further away than permitted by the velocity of light . ''",
    "then , referencing what has been reproduced here as figure 1 , bell elaborates : `` thus , for events in a space - time region 1 ... we would look for causes in the backward light cone , and for effects in the future light cone . in a region like 2 ,",

    "of course this does not mean that events in 1 and 2 might not be correlated ...

    "see , for example , the region labeled @xmath5 in figure 3 .",

    "and there is therefore the possibility that specification of events from 2 could allow one to infer something about x from which one could in turn infer _ more _ about goings - on in 1 than one could have inferred originally from just the full specification of beables in @xmath5 . in other words",
    "( bell s ) : `` the traces in region 2 of causes [ such as our x ] of events in 1 could well supplement whatever else was being used for calculating probabilities about 1 . ''",
    "this mechanism for producing violations of equation [ eq : loc ] without any superluminal causation , however , will clearly not be available so long as `` region 3 completely shields off from 1 the overlap of the backward light cones of 1 and 2 . ''",
    "similar to figure 2 , except that region @xmath5 ( unlike region 3 of figure 2 ) fails to shield off region 1 from the overlapping backward light cones of regions 1 and 2 .",
    "thus , ( following the language of figure 2 s caption ) even full specification of what happens in @xmath5 _ does not necessarily make _ events in 2 irrelevant for predictions about 1 in a locally causal theory .",
    ", width=316 ]    bell s other clarification is also crucial .",
    "suppose that events in region 3 of figure 2 are _ not _ specified completely .",
    "we may denote such an incomplete description by @xmath9 . then does a violation of equation [ eq : loc ] ( but with @xmath10 )",
    "necessarily imply the existence of any nonlocal causation ?",
    "no , for it would then be possible that some event x ( again in the overlapping past light cones of 1 and 2 ) influences both 1 and 2 such that information about 2 could tell us something about x which in turn could tell us something about 1 which we could nt infer from @xmath9 . we only need stipulate that the beables in region 3 which `` carry '' the causal influence from x to 1 are ( among ) those omitted by @xmath9 .",
    "but since there is , by definition , no such omission in the _ complete _ specification @xmath11 , this eventuality can not arise , and a violation of equation [ eq : loc ] _ must _ indicate the existence of some nonlocal causation , i.e. , causal influences not respecting bell s original `` principle of local causality '' ( as displayed in figure 1 ) . ] in [ our equation [ eq : loc ] ] does not contain a complete record of events ... it can be usefully supplemented by information from region 2 .",

    "this is especially relevant since we will eventually criticize jarrett for failing to appreciate ( in his 1984 paper ) this particular aspect .",
    "so it should nt be thought that we are criticizing him for something bell only understood and clarified later .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that there are some interesting differences between bell s 1975 and 1990 formulations of local causality ; these will be explored elsewhere , though , since they do not bear on jarrett s analysis . ]",
    "it is worth noting that we can not necessarily infer , from a violation of equation [ eq : loc ] , that @xmath14 exerts any direct or indirect causal influence on @xmath15 .",
    "it might be , for example , that a violation of equation [ eq : loc ] is produced by some x - like event lying in the future of region 3 , which causally influences both 1 and 2 .",
    "but in order to exert a _ local _ causal influence on 1 , such an x would have to lie _ outside _ the past light cone of 2  and vice versa .",
    "what is ensured by a violation of equation [ eq : loc ] is thus only that _ some _ violation of local causality ( as sketched in figure 1 ) is being posited somewhere by the theory in question . whether something in 2 is exerting a causal influence on 1 ( or vice versa , or neither ) the mere violation of equation [ eq : loc ] does nt permit us to say .    note that everything in the above discussion refers to some particular candidate physical theory .",
    "for example , there is a tendency for misplaced skepticism to arise from bell s use of the concept of `` beables '' in the formulation of local causality .",
    "this term strikes the ears of those influenced by orthodox quantum philosophy as having a metaphysical character and/or possibly committing one ( already , in the very definition of what it means for a theory to respect relativistic local causality ) to something unorthodox like `` realism '' or `` hidden variables .",
    "'' such concerns , however , are based on the failure to appreciate that the concept `` beable '' is theory - relative .",
    "`` beable '' refers not to what _ is _ physically real , but to what some candidate theory _ posits _ as being physically real .",
    "bell writes : `` i use the term ` beable ' rather than some more committed term like ` being ' or ` beer ' to recall the essentially tentative nature of any physical theory .",
    "such a theory is at best a _ candidate _ for the description of nature .",
    "terms like ` being ' , ` beer ' , ` existent ' , etc . , would seem to me lacking in humility .",
    "in fact ` beable ' is short for ` maybe - able ' . ''",
    "( 1984 , p. 174 )    similar considerations apply to the notion of `` completeness '' that is , as stressed above , essential to bell s formulation .",
    "a complete specification of beables in some spacetime region simply means a specification of everything ( relevant ) that is posited by the candidate theory in question .",
    "there is no presumption that such a full specification actually correspond to what _ really exists _ in the relevant spacetime region , i.e. , no presumption that the candidate theory in question is _ true_. and the same goes for the probabilities in equation [ eq : loc ] that bell s locality criterion is formulated in terms of .",
    "these should be read not as empirical frequencies or subjective measures of expectation , but as the fundamental dynamical probabilities described by the candidate theory in question ( which we assume , without loss of generality , to be irreducibly stochastic ) .",
    "since all the crucial aspects of bell s formulation of locality are thus meaningful only relative to some candidate theory , it is perhaps puzzling how bell thought we could say anything about the locally causal character of nature .",

    "we simply do not have [ equation [ eq : loc ] ] . ''",
    "( 1975 , p. 55 ) of course , one might contemplate an alternative theory in which the relevant complete specification of beables included something else in addition to ( or instead of ) the qm wave function ; such an alternative may or may not exhibit any nonlocal causation .",
    "this illustrates the point made earlier : what we diagnose as `` nonlocal '' by applying bell s criterion is some particular candidate theory ( as opposed to immediately inferring , from either the empirical predictions of a theory or a given set of empirical observations , that some non - local causation is occuring in nature . )",
    "the point here is that orthodox qm s account of the `` einstein s boxes '' scenario involves non - local causation ; whether any nonlocality in fact occurs in nature when one performs the indicated experiment involving an @xmath16-particle , however , is a very different question .",
    "if , for example , bohmian mechanics ( rather than orthodox qm ) is true , the answer would be no . ]    for ease of future reference and to fix some terminology , it will be helpful to lay out here a bit more explicitly the type of setup involved in the bell experiments , and to indicate precisely how one gets from locality as formulated by bell to the somewhat different - looking mathematical condition ( sometimes called `` factorizability '' ) from which standard derivations of bell s inequality proceed .",
    "the setup relevant to bell s theorem involves a particle source which emits pairs of spin - correlated particles , and two spatially separated devices each of which allows measurement of one of several spin components on the respective incident particle .",
    "( in actual experiments , the particles are typically photons with polarization playing the role of `` spin . '' ) two experimenters , traditionally alice and bob , man the two devices .",
    "we use the symbols @xmath17 and @xmath18 to refer , respectively , to the `` settings '' of alice s and bob s apparatus ( one usually thinks here of an axis in space along which the polarizer or stern - gerlach magnetic field is oriented ) , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 to refer to the `` outcomes '' of their respective spin - component measurements .",
    "finally , we will use the symbol @xmath21 to refer to the `` state of the particle pair . ''",
    "the scare - quotes around the various terms here are an advertisement for the following discussion .",
    "first , note that all of the symbols just introduced refer to _ beables_. there is a tendency in the literature for all of these things ( the apparatus settings , the outcomes , and the physical state of the particle pair ) to remain needlessly abstract .",
    "but all of these things are perfectly concrete , at least relative to some particular candidate theory .",
    "the setting of alice s apparatus , for example , refers to something like the spatial orientation of a stern - gerlach device , or some sort of knob or lever on some more black - box - ish device .",
    "thus , this `` setting '' ultimately comes down to the spatial configuration of some physically real matter , i.e. , it must be reflected somehow in the beables posited by any serious candidate theory .",
    "likewise , the outcome of alice s experiment is not some ethereal event taking place in alice s consciousness or some other place about which serious candidate physical theories fail to speak directly .",
    "rather , the outcome should be thought of as being displayed in the post - measurement position of a pointer ( or the arrangement of some ink on a piece of paper , etc . )  in short , the outcome too is just a convenient way of referring to some physically real and directly observable configuration of matter , and so will necessarily be reflected in the beables posited by any serious candidate theory . the case with @xmath21 is a little different , because this is not something to which we have any sort of direct observational access .",
    "but this only means there is significantly more freedom about what sort of beables @xmath21 might refer to in various different candidate theories .",
    "space - time diagram illustrating the various beables of relevance for a discussion of factorization . separated observers alice and bob make spin - component measurements ( using apparatus characterized by variables @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively ) of a pair of entangled spin-1/2 particles .",
    "the state of the particles ( and/or any other appropriately associated beables ) is denoted @xmath21 , and the outcomes of the two measurements are represented by the beables @xmath19 ( in region 1 ) and @xmath20 ( in region 2 ) .",
    "note that @xmath21 and @xmath17 jointly constitute a complete specification of beables in space - time region @xmath22 , which shields off region 1 from the overlap of the past light cones of 1 and 2 .",

    "thus the joint specification of @xmath21 and @xmath17 will  in a locally causal theory  make @xmath18 and @xmath20 redundant for a theory s predictions about @xmath19 ( and likewise , specification of @xmath21 and @xmath18 will render @xmath17 and @xmath19 redundant for predictions about @xmath20 ) .",
    ", width=316 ]    the basic space - time structure of the setup in question is sketched in figure 4 , and the overall logic is explained in the caption . the idea is simply to apply bell s locality condition to the two measurement outcomes @xmath19 and @xmath20 in order to assert that the probability assigned to a given outcome ( by a locally causal candidate theory ) should be independent of both the setting and outcome of the distant experiment .",
    "that is , in a locally causal theory , we must have @xmath24 and @xmath25 it is then trivial to apply the definition of conditional probability to arrive at the conclusion that the joint probability ( for outcomes @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) _ factorizes _ :",
    "@xmath26 bell writes : `` very often such factorizability is taken as the starting point of the analysis .",
    "here we have preferred to see it not as the _ formulation _ of ` local causality ' , but as a consequence thereof . ''",
    "( 1990 , p. 243 )    it is also important that the apparatus settings @xmath17 and @xmath18 are in some sense `` free . ''",
    "this is often discussed in terms of alice and bob making literal last - minute free - will choices about how to orient their devices .",
    "what is actually required for the proof is merely the assumption that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are ( stochastically ) independent of the particle pair state @xmath21 .",
    "this comes up in the course of the derivation of bell s inequality when we write an expression for predicted empirical frequency of a certain joint outcome as a weighted average over the candidate theory s predictions for a given @xmath21  that is , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the probability that a given particle pair state @xmath21 is produced by the preparation procedure used at the source .    if the probability distribution @xmath28 actually depended on @xmath17 or @xmath18  as one would expect if the particle pair exerted some causal influence on the settings ( or vice versa ! ) or if the particle pair and the settings were mutually causally influenced in some non - trivial way by events farther back in the past  then the above expression for the empirical frequency would be invalid and the derivation of the bell inequality would nt go through .    this might seem like cause for concern , especially considering that ( as displayed in figure 4 ) the past light cones of @xmath17 and @xmath18 overlap with the region containing @xmath21  and @xmath21 by definition is supposed to contain a _",
    "complete _ specification of beables in this region . given all that",
    ", one wonders how @xmath17 and @xmath18 could possibly _ not _ be causally influenced by @xmath21 ( in a locally causal theory ) .",
    "here we see the reason for another aspect of bell s carefully - phrased formulation of locality , which requires that beables in ( the relevant ) `` region 3 '' ( which will of course be two different regions for the two measurements ) be `` sufficiently specified , for example by a full specification ... '' here there is the implication that a specification could be sufficient _ without _ being complete .",
    "for example , some candidate theory ( and this is actually true of every serious extant candidate theory ) might provide a specification of the state of the particle pair which is sufficient in the relevant sense , even though it leaves out some fact ( say , the millionth digit of the energy of some relic microwave background photon that happens to fly into the detection region just prior to the measurement ) which actually exists in the relevant spacetime region .",
    "such a fact could then be allowed to determine the setting @xmath17 without introducing even the slightest evidence for the problematic sort of correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , this is just an exaggerated version of what happens in the actual experiments , where carefully - isolated and independent pseudo - random - number generators are used to produce the settings at the two stations .    finally , as shimony , horne , and clauser",

    "what is important is that equation [ eq : factor ] ( along with the `` freedom '' or `` no conspiracies '' assumption just discussed ) entails the bell inequality .",
    "the derivation is standard and will not be repeated here .",
    "we will instead simply note that ( starting in 1975 ) bell almost always referred to the empirically testable inequality as the `` locality inequality . ''",
    "one can hopefully now appreciate why .    one final caveat .",
    "there is a sense in which our verbal description of the meanings of the relevant beables ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) is potentially confusing .",
    "for example , there is no sense in which bell makes some dubious `` extra assumption '' that , e.g. , _",
    "particles _ fly from the `` particle source '' to the measurement devices .",
    "a theory which posits no particle beables , but only ( say ) waves or a wave function or _",
    "whatever _ is perfectly fine and the formal locality criterion will apply to it just the same way .",
    "only the words would need to change .",
    "relatedly , many papers in the bell literature raise issues about hidden variables associated not with the particle pair , but with the measurement devices .",
    "have we excluded such variables , since our @xmath17 refers only to some knob setting on alice s device and @xmath21 refers only to the state of the particle pair ?",
    "the only important distinction here is that @xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to beables which are `` free '' ( or `` random '' ) in the above sense , while the variables @xmath21 are somehow set by past events .",
    "this is no doubt a fuzzy distinction , but nothing important hinges on it .",
    "the point is that any microscopic features of alice s device ( hidden or not )  or anything else relevant to the candidate theory s predictions for the probabilities in question  can be included under the `` setting '' variables ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) _ or _ the `` particle state '' variables ( @xmath21 ) , whichever seems more natural . in short ,",
    "bell s formulation of locality is significantly more general than might otherwise be suggested by some of the words used to describe it .",
    "jon jarrett s influential analysis of bell s locality criterion begins with equations [ eq : bla ] and [ eq : blb ] , which he dubs `` strong locality . ''",
    "( of course , we are innocuously changing  and occasionally simplifying ",
    "jarrett s notation to make it consistent with that introduced above . ) for simplicity , let us focus the discussion on equation [ eq : bla ] .",
    "jarrett defines two sub - conditions which , he subsequently proves , are jointly equivalent to this `` strong locality . ''",
    "the first sub - condition jarrett dubs `` locality . ''",
    "( it is also sometimes referred to as `` simple locality '' or `` parameter independence '' or `` remote context independence '' in the literature . ) @xmath29 as jarrett explains , `` locality requires that the probability for the outcome [ @xmath19 ] ... be determined ` locally ' ; i.e. , that it depend only on the state @xmath21 ... of the two - particle system and on the state [ @xmath17 ] of the measuring device .",
    "in particular , that probability must be independent of which ( if any ) component of spin the distant measuring device is set to measure . ''",
    "jarrett s second sub - condition , which he dubs `` completeness '' ( and is also known as `` predictive completeness , '' `` outcome independence , '' `` remote outcome independence '' and `` conditional outcome independence '' ) is the following : @xmath32 which `` asserts the stochastic independence of the two outcomes in each pair of spin measurements . ''",
    "it is easy to see that , indeed , `` locality '' and `` completeness '' are jointly equivalent to bell s locality condition as expressed in equation [ eq : bla ] .",
    "first , @xmath33 is , under the assumption of `` completeness , '' equal to @xmath34 . and this , in turn , is equal to @xmath35 under the assumption of `` locality '' .",
    "so `` locality '' and `` completeness '' jointly entail `` strong locality . '' and likewise `` strong locality '' clearly entails both `` locality '' and `` completeness . ''",
    "so the two sub - conditions are , indeed , equivalent to equation [ eq : bla ] .",
    "the alleged significance of this decomposition , however , emerges only from jarrett s discussion of the physical interpretation of his two sub - conditions .",
    "first , jarrett argues that `` locality '' is equivalent to the prohibition of superluminal signaling , and hence expresses just what relativity requires of other theories .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , both steps of this argument have been found wanting .",
    "first , it is only in combination with some assumptions about the _ controllability _ of various beables ( notably @xmath21 ) that jarrett s `` locality '' is equivalent to the prohibition on superluminal signaling .",
    "there is at least one extant , empirically viable theory ( bohmian mechanics ) which violates jarrett s `` locality '' condition and yet does nt permit the possibility of superluminal signaling , precisely because the relevant states can not ( as a matter of principle , as predicted by the theory ) be sufficiently controlled . and second , it is dubious to claim that the prohibition of superluminal _ signals _ adequately captures relativity s fundamental speed limit .",
    "this would , for example , render bohmian mechanics consistent with sr despite its need to postulate a dynamically privileged reference frame  a `` gross violation of relativistic causality '' according to bell .",
    "( 1984 , p. 171 ) but since these problems have been discussed elsewhere in the literature , we leave them aside here and focus instead on jarrett s physical interpretation of his second sub - condition , `` completeness . ''",

    "is determined exclusively by factors ( namely @xmath17 and @xmath54 ) which are present at her location . no nonlocal causal influence exists .",
    "instead , the violation of equation [ eq : jc ] indicates only that we were dealing with _",
    "incomplete state descriptions _",
    ", such that bob s outcome provides some _ information _",
    "( usefully supplementing what was already contained in @xmath21 ) which warrants an updating of probabilities .    on the basis of this example",
    ", jarrett thus urges the following physical interpretation of his two sub - conditions : a violation of `` locality '' would allow the possibility of sending superluminal signals , and hence indicates clearly the existence of some relativity - violating superluminal causal influences ; on the other hand , a violation of `` completeness '' does not indicate the existence of any relativity - violating influences , but instead suggests only that the state descriptions of the theory in question are not complete .",
    "it is clear that these physical interpretations of the two conditions were the basis for jarrett s decision to name them `` locality '' and `` completeness '' respectively .    here",
    "is jarrett s summary of the cash value of this decomposition _ vis - a - vis _ bell s theorem and the associated experiments : these together provide very strong evidence `` that strong locality can not be satisfied by any empirically adequate theory . since locality is contravened only on pain of a serious conflict with relativity theory ( which is extraordinarily well - confirmed independently ) , it is appropriate to assign the blame to the completeness condition . ...",
    "[ o]ne must conclude that certain phenomena simply can not be adequately represented by any theory which ascribes properties to the entities it posits in such a way that no measurement on the system may yield information which is both non - redundant ( not deducible from the state descriptions ) and predictively relevant for distant measurements . that ` information ' is not ( neither explicitly nor implicitly ) contained in the ` incomplete ' state description . ''",
    "the fundamental origin of the disagreement between bell and jarrett should now be clear : the two authors do not understand ( e.g. ) equation [ eq : bla ] in the same way . for bell ,",
    "the variables @xmath21 in this formula ( together with @xmath17 as per the previous discussion ) constitute a _",
    "complete _ ( or perhaps merely sufficient ) specification of beables in some space - time region that has the same relation to alice s experiment that region 3 ( of figure 1 ) had to region 1 .",
    "jarrett , by contrast , is agnostic about the completeness of the description afforded by @xmath21 .",
    "strictly speaking , therefore , jarrett s decomposition of equation [ eq : bla ] is not a decomposition of bell s locality condition , but , rather , a decomposition of some sort of no - correlation condition @xmath55 which is analogous to equation [ eq : loc ] , except that , following the notation of section ii , the variables @xmath9 are _ not _ assumed to provide a complete specification of beables in the relevant spacetime region . but as we have already discussed in section ii , and as bell was perfectly aware , a violation of equation [ eq : nocorr ] does not necessarily indicate the presence of any nonlocal causation in the candidate theory in question . indeed , it is precisely to close off the avenue eventually taken by jarrett ( that is , blaming a violation of this `` no - correlation '' condition on the incompleteness of the specified beables ) that bell specifically stresses the importance that `` events in [ the relevant region ] be specified completely . ''",
    "( 1990 , p. 240 )    this confusion  this departure from bell s actual locality criterion  is the ultimate basis for jarrett s choice of terminology , and also for any initial plausibility of his project of establishing `` peaceful coexistence '' by showing that a violation of the locality criterion needed for bell s inequality ( in particular , a violation of his `` completeness '' sub - condition ) need not indicate any conflict with relativistic local causality .    of course , one could simply apply jarrett s decomposition strategy to bell s actual locality condition .",
    "that is , it is true that , as jarrett claimed to have shown , bell s locality condition can be decomposed into two jarrett - like sub - conditions  namely , our equations [ eq : jl ] and [ eq : jc ] but now with the requirement ( inherited from bell s actual locality condition ) that @xmath21 provide a complete ( or sufficient ) specification of relevant beables ( as posited by some candidate theory whose locality is being assessed by the locality condition ) . but _ this _ decomposition fails to have any of the physical implications urged by jarrett . in particular , a violation of the ( strengthened ) `` completeness '' condition @xmath56 ( formally equivalent to jarrett s `` completeness '' sub - condition , but now , with bell but contra jarrett , with the insistence that @xmath21 and @xmath17 jointly provide a complete description of beables in some spacetime region through the past of @xmath19 which divides @xmath19 off completely from the overlap of the past light cones of @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) has absolutely nothing to do with the completeness of state descriptions , but instead indicates the presence of some nonlocal causation ( in violation of the causal structure outlined in figure 1 ) in the candidate theory in question .",
    "the most that could be said to distinguish the two sub - conditions is that , since @xmath18 is ( by definition ) controllable and @xmath20 ( most likely ) is nt , a violation of [ eq : jl ] is ( all other things being equal ) more likely to yield the possibility of superluminal _ signaling _ than a violation of [ eq : jc ] . but that only matters if we drop what bell calls `` fundamental relativity '' and instead read sr instrumentally , as prohibiting superluminal signalling but allowing in principle superluminal causation ( so long as it ca nt be harnessed by humans to transmit messages ) .",
    "that is , at best , a dubious and controversial reading of sr , as already mentioned .",
    "it is sometimes suggested that the relation between bell and jarrett on this point is one of basic agreement , since both held that the validity of equation [ eq : jc ] has something to do with the completeness of the physical theory in question .",
    "this is doubly incorrect .",
    "first , the mathematical condition in question is , for jarrett , a _ formulation _ of completeness ; it is , for bell , ( part of ) a formulation of local causality which functions appropriately as such _ only if the relevant symbols in the formula stand for a complete specification of the relevant beables_. according to jarrett , equation [ eq : jc ] is supposed to tell us whether completeness holds . for bell ,",
    "on the other hand , the equation ( correctly understood ) already presupposes that completeness holds .",
    "( if it does nt hold , the condition is useless for his purposes , and states only that the two outcomes are uncorrelated . ) and second , where jarrett ( and most subsequent commentators ) regard the `` completeness '' in question as a property of _ theories _ , bell regards his `` completeness '' as a property of a certain _ specification of beables _ relative to some candidate theory . in this context , the separate question of whether the theory itself is complete ( i.e. , whether its posited beables capture everything that really exists ) simply does nt come up .    note also that , even on his own terms , i.e. , even leaving aside his departure from bell s actual locality criterion , jarrett s formulation of completeness actually fails as a criterion for assessing the completeness of the relevant physical state descriptions .    consider again equation [ eq : jc ] where for the moment we follow jarrett and interpret @xmath21 here as providing some kind of state description , but not necessarily a complete one .",
    "jarrett has shown ( with the example discussed in section iii ) that a violation of this condition can sometimes be blamed on the use of incomplete state descriptions , with no implication of any superluminal causation .",
    "but it is equally easy to display an example in which violation of jarrett s condition _ can not _ be blamed on incomplete state descriptions , but instead indicates the presence of superluminal causation .",
    "consider a toy model discussed by maudlin , in which each particle in the pair is indeterminate ( in regard to its spin along any particular direction ) until one of the particles encounters a spin - measurement apparatus ; at this point , this `` first '' particle flips a coin to decide whether to emerge from the @xmath37 or the @xmath39 port of the apparatus , and sends an instantaneous tachyon signal to the other particle in the pair , instructing it as to how it should behave in order to give rise to the correct quantum mechanical joint outcomes .",
    "assuming , as before , that @xmath57 , and that bob s particle arrives at its detector first with the result @xmath46 , this model makes the same predictions , equations [ eq : comp1 ] and [ eq : comp2 ] , as the local deterministic model discussed by jarrett .",
    "and so this model , like jarrett s , violates jarrett s `` completeness '' condition . and",
    "yet clearly with this model there is no blaming that violation on the use of incomplete state descriptions  instead here it is obvious ( by construction ) that the violation is due to the presence of superluminal causal influences ( in the particular form of `` tachyon signals '' ) .",
    "this should not be surprising .",
    "we have already argued that , if one follows bell in requiring @xmath21 to constitute a complete state description , then a violation of jarrett s `` completeness '' can _ only _ be understood as indicating the presence of nonlocal causation .",
    "the point here is that , even if we follow jarrett in remaining agnostic about the completeness of the description afforded by @xmath21 , we can not _ necessarily _ say that a violation of `` completeness '' is compatible with relativity s prohibition on superluminal causation",
    ". it might be ( as shown by jarrett s model ) .",
    "but it might not be ( as shown by maudlin s ) .",
    "the correct conclusion is therefore as follows : a violation of jarrett s `` completeness '' condition ( where we are openly agnostic about the completeness of the state description @xmath21 ) means _ either _ that we have relativity - violating nonlocal causation , _ or _ that we were dealing with incomplete state descriptions . and",
    "_ this _ dilemma is precisely that posed already in 1935 by einstein , podolsky , and rosen : _ either _ we concede bohr s claim that the qm description of states is complete and accept the reality of the nonlocal causation present in that theory ; _ or _ we reject the completeness claim and adopt a different ( `` hidden variables '' ) theory which ( the authors thought ) could restore locality .",
    "jarrett also sees a similarity between his conclusion and that of epr ( namely that qm is not complete ) .",
    "but where epr considered this a defect to be corrected in some alternative `` hidden variable '' theory ( which they hoped would also restore local causality ) , jarrett argues that incompleteness is not a defect of orthodox qm , but , rather , a fact of nature :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` by separating out the relativistic component of the strong locality condition ... there emerges a clarification of that class of theories excluded by the bell arguments : the class of theories which satisfy completeness . although the term ` incompleteness ' may connote a defect ( as if , as was the case for the model discussed [ above ] , all incomplete theories may be ` complet_ed _ ' ) , incomplete theories ( e.g. , quantum mechanics ) are by no means _ ipso facto _ defective . on the contrary ,",
    "when the result of bell - type experiments are taken into account , the truly remarkable implication of bell s theorem is that incompleteness , in some sense , is a genuine feature of the world itself . ''",

    "( this occurs in the context of their agreeing with epr that qm is incomplete , which they establish by arguing that , since the correct conclusion from bell / experiment is that jarrett s `` completeness '' condition fails , then the stronger epr completeness condition must also fail , just as the epr authors claimed . ) but this association is mistaken , since the argument ballentine and jarrett display sneaks in the additional premise of ( epr s version of ) local causality . , since the @xmath58 device is at spacelike separation from it ... ''",
    "this mistake was also noted by andrew elby , harvey r. brown , and sara foster in `` what makes a theory physically complete ? '' _ found .",
    "_ 23(7 ) , 971 - 985 ( 1993 ) .",
    "note also that this error leads ballentine and jarrett to remark , in passing , that epr s concept of completeness entails determinism all by itself , which is surely a misrepresentation of the worries of einstein and his followers .",
    "see section 1 of bell s 1981 , pp .",
    "139 - 145 , and the important footnote 10  already partially quoted in the introduction  on p. 157 . ] and this is the premise that does ( literally ) all the work in the epr argument .",
    "there is thus no apparent sense at all in which epr s completeness has anything to do with jarrett s , except that it was precisely in the face of qm s violation of jarrett s `` completeness '' that epr argued ( correctly ) that qm was a non - local theory which , perhaps , could be replaced by a locally causal alternative theory by adding hidden variables ( or jettisoning the description in terms of wave functions entirely ) . indeed , at the end of the day",
    ", it is pretty clear that jarrett s condition has nothing to do with the completeness of physical state descriptions . in concluding ( from bell s theorem and the associated experiments ) that reality itself is `` in some sense '' incomplete , jarrett makes clear that he is no longer using the term with anything like its ordinary meaning ",
    "namely , a description which leaves nothing ( relevant ) out . by what standard , exactly , could `` the world itself '' be supposed to have left something out ?",
    "it is worth stepping back , therefore , and clarifying what , if anything , one can say about `` completeness . ''",
    "there are two related senses on the table .",
    "first of all , a theory may be said to be `` complete '' or `` incomplete '' in relation to external physical reality . in this sense ,",
    "a theory is complete if and only if it captures or describes everything ( relevant ) that in fact really exists .",
    "this is of course just the sense of completeness of interest to epr .",
    "their argument , in essence , was that relativistic local causality ( which they simply took for granted ) combined with certain empirical predictions of qm entailed the existence of some `` elements of reality '' which had no counterpart in the qm description of reality .",
    "that is , the qm description left something out ; it was hence an incomplete theory .",
    "since this usage of `` completeness '' involves a comparison between theories and external reality ( to which our best access is precisely through theories ! ) , there is a tendency for it to be regarded as `` metaphysical '' .",
    "perhaps this apparently metaphysical flavor is responsible for jarrett s suppression of bell s requirement that @xmath21 contain a complete specification of the relevant beables . since there d be no way to verify whether a given specification was or was nt complete in this sense",
    ", one might think , bell s requirement is meaningless and might as well just be dropped .",
    "but this attitude fails to appreciate one of bell s important advances ",
    "namely , that his formulation of local causality is a criterion for assessing the locality of _ candidate theories_. as already discussed in section ii , bell s `` complete specification of beables '' simply does not mean a specification that captures everything which in fact really exists ; rather , it means a specification which captures everything which is _ posited _ to exist _ by some candidate theory_. there is thus nothing the least bit metaphysical or obscure about bell s requirement .",
    "for any unambiguously formulated candidate theory , there should be no question about what is being posited to exist .",
    "and so there will be no ambiguity about what a complete description of relevant beables should consist of , and hence no ambiguity about the status ",
    "_ vis - a - vis _ local causality  of a given well - formulated theory .",
    "there will of course still be difficult questions about how to decide whether a given candidate theory is _ true _ , and hence whether the particular _ sort _ of non - local causation contained in it accurately describes some aspect of nature .",
    "but the miracle of bell s argument is that we need not know which theory is true , in order to know that the true theory ( whatever it turns out to be ) will have to exhibit non - local , super - luminal causation .",
    "there is thus no escaping bell s conclusion that some sort of non - local causation ( in violation of the structure displayed in figure 1 ) exists in nature  in apparent conflict with what most physicists take to be the requirements of sr .",
    "in the previous section , we interpreted jarrett as claiming that a violation of his `` completeness '' condition in no way implied the presence of non - local causation , but instead only implied that the state descriptions used in the test had been incomplete .",
    "this is both fair and unfair  fair because jarrett does hang his entire case for the plausibility of his terminology and his physical interpretation of the two sub - conditions on precisely this view , but also unfair because jarrett also later seems to acknowledge that , ultimately , his `` completeness '' condition has to be understood very differently .",
    "for example , he remarks in a footnote that `` completeness , too , has the character of a ` locality ' condition . '' and the trend in the bell literature since jarrett s paper has certainly been to concede that a violation of jarrett s `` completeness '' can not be quite so trivially written off ( as involving a mere updating of information in the face of having previously used incomplete state descriptions ) , but rather must be understood as indicating _ some _ sort of non - locality or `` holism '' or `` non - separability '' or non - causal `` passion at a distance . ''",
    "we do not , therefore , wish to claim that jarrett ( and those who follow him in thinking his decomposition is in some way or other helpful in understanding bell s locality condition and/or in establishing the peaceful coexistence of sr and qm ) fully commits precisely the mistake presented ( through the stark contrast to bell s views ) in the previous section .",
    "rather , we intend only the weaker claim that jarrett _",
    "et al . _ have been led , by jarrett s initial analysis , down a path which is _ obviously untenable _ once one clearly understands bell s own formulation of local causality ( including especially the parallel status ",
    "namely , both are _ beables _  of `` settings '' and `` outcomes , '' and the crucial distinction between superluminal causation and superluminal signaling ) .",
    "it turns out to be a rather subtle question whether or not sr genuinely requires local causality in the sense of figure 1 .",
    "but if one grants this ( and virtually all physicists and commentators _ do _ ) , then it really is possible to establish an    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` essential conflict between any sharp formulation [ of qm ] and fundamental relativity . that is to say , we have an apparent incompatibility , at the deepest level , between the two fundamental pillars of contemporary theory ...

    "i.e. , the claims that instead bell s theorem refutes only some already - dubious , dogmatic , philosophically - motivated program to restore `` determinism '' or `` classicality '' or `` realism '' ( and i mean here both classes of such claims mentioned in the introduction )  turn out inevitably to have their roots in a failure to appreciate some aspect of bell s own arguments .    there is , in particular , a tendency for a relatively superficial focus on the relatively formal aspects of bell s arguments , to lead commentators astray .",
    "for example , how many commentators have too - quickly breezed through the prosaic first section of bell s 1964 paper ( p. 14",
    "- 21 )  where his reliance on the epr argument `` _ _ from locality to _ _ deterministic hidden variables '' is made clear  and simply jumped ahead to section 2 s equation 1 ( p. 15 ) , hence erroneously inferring ( and subsequently reporting to other physicists and ultimately teaching to students ) that the derivation `` begins with deterministic hidden variables '' ? ( 1981 , p. 157 ) likewise , we have here explored in detail a similar case of too - quickly accepting some formal version of a premise used in bell s derivation ( such as `` factorizability '' ) while failing to appreciate the rich conceptual context that gives it the precise meaning bell intended .",
    "our final conclusion , therefore , is a plea  directed at physicists in general , but commentators on bell s theorem , textbook writers , and students in particular  to simply read ( and not just read , but _ read _ ) bell s writings .",
    "they are truly a model of clarity and physical insight , and almost always convey the essential ideas much more lucidly and tersely than anything in the secondary bell literature .",
    "( i have no doubt this applies even to the current essay ! )",
    "bell himself , in the preface to the first edition of his compiled papers ( _ speakable and unspeakable in quantum mechanics _ ) suggests that `` even quantum experts might begin with [ chapter ] 16 , ` bertlmann s socks and the nature of reality ' , not skipping the slightly more technical material at the end . ''",
    "it is hard to disagree with that advice , although a strong case could be made also for bell s 1990 essay ( written after the first edition of the book , and hence included only in the more recent second edition ) ` la nouvelle cuisine , ' in which the central importance and meaning of `` local causality '' is emphasized in lucid detail .    if more physicists would only study bell s papers instead of relying on dubious secondary reports , they would , i think , come to appreciate that there really is here a serious inconsistency to worry about .",
    "a much higher - level inconsistency between quantum theory and ( general ) relativity has been the impetus , in recent decades , for enormous efforts spent pursuing ( what bell once referred to as ) `` presently fashionable ` string theories ' of ` everything ' . '' ( 1990 , p. 235 ) how might a resolution of the more basic inconsistency identified by bell shed light on ( or radically alter the motivation and context for ) attempts to quantize gravity ?",
    "we ca nt possibly know until ( perhaps long after ) we face up squarely to bell s important insights ."
