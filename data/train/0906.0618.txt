    "the layered cobalt oxide na@xmath1coo@xmath0 has been intensively investigated as a promising thermoelectric material due to the large thermoelectric power ( tep ) together with the low resistivity for @xmath7@xcite .",
    "in addition to the large tep , this compound shows rich physical properties . for @xmath8",
    ", a weak magnetic order appear below @xmath9k@xcite , where the ferromagnetic ordered coo@xmath0 planes couple antiferromagnetically with each other .",
    "for @xmath10 , the anomalous metallic behavior is observed , where the temperature dependence of the uniform spin susceptibility is curie - weiss - like@xcite and the thermoelectric power @xmath11 , the resistivity @xmath12 and the electronic specific coefficient @xmath13 increase with increasing @xmath5 towards the magnetic ordered region@xcite .",
    "some theoretical studies on na@xmath1coo@xmath0 in na - rich region have been performed .",
    "for example , koshibae _",
    "et al_. studied the tep in the atomic limit by using the heikes formula focusing on the large spin - orbital degeneracy of co@xmath14 and co@xmath15@xcite .",
    "effects of the band structure , however , are not considered there .",
    "et al_. investigated the transport properties based on the single band hubbard model and found that the peculiar shape of the band structure called `` pudding mold '' plays important roles on the tep together with the low resistivity .",
    "effects of the electron correlation , however , are not explicitly taken into account@xcite . therefore , the microscopic theory including both effects of the band structure and the electron correlation is highly desired .    in the present study",
    ", we investigate the electronic states and the transport properties of the coo@xmath0 plane in na@xmath1coo@xmath0 by using the multi - orbital formula of the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation@xcite on the basis of the two - dimensional triangular lattice 11-band @xmath2-@xmath3 model@xcite .",
    "our model includes @xmath16 orbitals ( @xmath17 ) of co atoms on the two - dimensional triangular lattice and @xmath18 orbitals ( @xmath19 ) of o atoms which lie on the upper and the lower plane of the co plane , and is given by the following hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the annihilation operator for a co-@xmath16 electron with spin @xmath22 in the orbital @xmath23 at site @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the annihilation operator for a o-@xmath18 electron with spin @xmath22 in the orbital @xmath26 at site @xmath24 . in eq .",
    "( [ d - p ] ) , the transfer integrals @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the atomic energies @xmath30 , @xmath31 are determined so as to fit the energy bands obtained from the tight - binding approximation to those from the band calculation@xcite and are listed in ref .",
    "the band calculation predicted the large hole fermi surface around the @xmath32-point and the six small hole pockets near the @xmath33-points@xcite .",
    "however , the six small hole pockets have not been observed in the arpes measurements@xcite .",
    "thus , we introduce the change in the crystal field energy @xmath34 and then set @xmath35ev to sink those below the fermi level in the present study@xcite .",
    "@xmath36 is the hamiltonian of the coulomb interaction between the @xmath4 electrons on the co atom and characterized by the following parameters : the intra ( inter)-orbital direct terms @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , the hund s rule coupling @xmath39 and the pair transfer @xmath40@xcite . in the flex approximation , the spin ( charge - orbital ) susceptibility @xmath41 ( @xmath42 )",
    "is given as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 . in the above , @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "are the matrices whose components are given by @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the noninteracting green s function .",
    "the self - energy @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where the effective interaction is @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 we solve the above equations ( 2)-(5 ) self - consistently to obtain @xmath57 and @xmath42 , and then calculate @xmath12 and @xmath11 based on the linear response theory , where we neglect the vertex corrections .",
    "for simplicity , we assume @xmath58 , @xmath59 and set @xmath60ev , @xmath61ev in the present study . in the numerical calculation",
    ", we use the @xmath62 @xmath63-points and 256 matsubara frequencies .",
    "we show the temperature dependence of the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath64 in figure [ chis ] . for @xmath8",
    ", @xmath65 shows the curie - weiss - like behavior , while for @xmath66 , it shows the weak pseudogap like behavior at low temperatures . at the low temperature",
    ", @xmath65 increases with the doping @xmath5 due to the effect of the flat dispersion near the @xmath32-point ( @xmath63=(0,0 ) ) which approaches the fermi level with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "figure 2 shows the doping dependence of the effective mass of quasiparticles , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the retarded self - energy in the band basis which is obtained by the unitary transformation and the numerical analytic continuation of @xmath69 from the upper half plane to the real axis with use of the pad approximation . in the present paper , all of the numerical calculations",
    "are performed for @xmath70 .",
    "then , we obtain the extrapolated value of @xmath71 at @xmath72 from the data at @xmath73 by using the third order polynomial fit . for @xmath74",
    ", @xmath75 increases with increasing @xmath5 , as observed in experiments@xcite .",
    "the increase in @xmath75 with the doping @xmath5 is considered due to the effect of the ferromagnetic fluctuations as shown in @xmath65 at the low temperature .",
    "finally , we turn to the transport properties .",
    "( a ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "we find that @xmath12 increases with increasing @xmath5 , and shows concave downward temperature dependence for @xmath76 .",
    "( b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath11 is always positive and increases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the increases in both @xmath12 and @xmath11 with the doping @xmath5 are qualitatively consistent with experiments@xcite .",

    "we have investigated the electronic states and the transport properties of the coo@xmath0 plane in na@xmath1coo@xmath0 on the basis of the two - dimensional triangular lattice 11-band @xmath2-@xmath3 model by using the flex approximation .",
    "it has been found that the temperature dependence of @xmath65 shows the curie - weiss - like behavior for @xmath8 and @xmath75 , @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath65 increase with increasing @xmath5 for @xmath74 due to the effects of the ferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "these results are qualitatively consistent with experimental results@xcite .    however , we failed to reproduce the hump in the temperature dependence of @xmath11 experimentally observed at @xmath77@xcite .",
    "in addition , the absolute value of @xmath11 obtained from our calculation is less than a half of that from experiments@xcite .",
    "these results seem to be caused by underestimation of the ferromagnetic fluctuations in the flex approximation .",
    "the effects of the mode - mode coupling due to the vertex corrections , which are considered to play crucial roles for the nearly ferromagnetic metals as shown in the self - consistent renormalization theory@xcite , are neglected in the flex approximation and will be discussed in the subsequent paper .",
