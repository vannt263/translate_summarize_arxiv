    "modeling the propagation of information ( innovations , virus , fads , etc ) on a network is receiving a lot of interest because of the many applications and of the interesting problems that can be posed @xcite . in the formalization of this problem",
    ", the state of a node can be in two states , either informed or not .",
    "the information diffusion properties depend on ( i ) the microscopic model linking the state of a node with the state of its neighbors and ( ii ) the structure of the network .",
    "concerning the first aspect , a general and successful approach @xcite has been to assume that the state of a node changes and becomes informed when more than a certain fraction of the neighbors are also informed .",
    "this means that the dynamics of the process is clearly non - linear due to the presence of the threshold @xcite .",
    "since the model depends linearly on the threshold parameter , this model is termed the linear threshold model ( ltm ) .",
    "ltm was originally proposed to study collective social behavior , incorporating the idea of social reinforcement . in economic terms , this class of problems is known as _ binary decisions with externalities _",
    "the externalityrepresents the fact that one agent cares about the opinion of the others agents in order to take decisions .",
    "both the detailed mechanisms involved in binary decision problems , and also the origins of the externalities can vary widely across specific problems .",
    "ltm finds a lot of applications in economics @xcite , sociology @xcite and neural networks @xcite .",
    "concerning the structure of the network , the dynamics of ltm has been extensively studied on random graphs of erds - rnyi type .",
    "the model exhibits various critical behaviors .",
    "there is a critical threshold parameter at which a single active node can trigger a macroscopic cascade @xcite .",
    "moreover , if the threshold parameter is held fixed , there exists another sharp transition from an inactive state where no diffusion occurs to an active state with global diffusion , and the transition is triggered at a critical fraction of the initially active nodes @xcite .",
    "also the presence of hubs and the role of degree distribution in these random graph models have been studied extensively @xcite    real networks often display a structure that is not compatible with random graphs .",
    "the presence of communities has been documented in many real ( social ) networks and this has of course consequences on the propagation of information @xcite .",
    "generically , community structure within a network can facilitate information spread to a larger extent than a homogeneous random network @xcite .",
    "the impact of a community structure on the information diffusion according to the ltm has been theoretically studied very recently for the first time by nematzadeh et al .",
    "they considered a network described by two homogeneous modules , i.e. the internal connectivity of the two communities is the same , and the set of initially informed nodes is located in one of the two communities .",
    "the main result is that the global diffusion can be reached when the network is not homogeneous , i.e. the presence of modules facilitates the diffusion of information from one community to the other .",
    "nematzadeh et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of _ optimal modularity _ : the homogeneous random graph is not optimal in order to have global informative cascades , but there exists a range of values of the modularity such that the extent of the cascade is maximal .",
    "however the ( symmetric ) modular structure is only one of the possible community structures that a network can have . a more flexible way of modeling a group structure in a network is by using the stochastic block model ( sbm ) @xcite .",
    "as detailed below , in an sbm the probability of a link depends only on the groups the two considered nodes belong to .",
    "one of the advantages of the sbm is that it describes not only the symmetric modular case , but also core - periphery @xcite , assortative , and disassortative networks .",
    "in this paper we study the ltm dynamics on a sbm .",
    "thus one of the objectives of the present work is to extend the analysis performed by nematzadeh et al . to networks described by structures richer than the symmetric modular one .",
    "specifically we consider networks described by the sbm and for simplicity we consider a network described by two equally sized communities .",
    "we introduce the concept of _ optimal structure _ ,",
    "i.e. the parameters of the sbm which allows a global cascade .",
    "more specifically , in the following we consider two related optimization problems . given a value of the threshold parameter , let @xmath0 be the @xmath1 affinity matrix of the sbm and let us assume that a fraction @xmath2 of nodes in the first group is initially informed , while @xmath3 .",
    "moreover let @xmath4/2 $ ] be the fraction of informed nodes at time @xmath5 in the network .",
    "the first optimization problem we study is @xmath6 i.e. finding the sbm model with fixed mean degree @xmath7 and initial fraction @xmath8 of informed nodes which _ maximizes _ the fraction of informed nodes in the network at the end of the cascade .",
    "we find that the optimal structures include the modular one ( in agreement with @xcite ) but also include other assortative , core - periphery , and even disassortative structures .",
    "the second optimization problem considers the costof informing the initial set and considers the problem @xmath9 i.e. finding the sbm model with fixed mean degree @xmath7 for which a global cascade is asymptotically obtained and for which the fraction of initially informed nodes is _ minimal_. in this case we find that the optimal structure is in the assortative regime but very close to core periphery structures , i.e. where the probability of links between the two communities is the same or slightly smaller than the one inside the initially uninformed community .",
    "our analysis shows the presence of tipping points similar to those observed by singh et al .",
    "@xcite for homogeneous random networks .",
    "the presence of tipping points of the global density of informed nodes has also been observed by nematzadeh et al .",
    "@xcite for modular networks .",
    "however our analysis differs from the last one because we study separately the density of informed nodes belonging to different communities , in order to show how the information diffuses from an informed community to an uniformed one .",
    "we find that the presence of tipping points is almost ubiquitous , independently from the various network structures .",
    "however the value of the critical initial density , defining the tipping point , is strongly dependent from the network structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : network dynamics ]",
    "we summarize the threshold model , the stochastic block modeling approach , and how to analyze theoretically the density of informed nodes . in section [ sec : cascade phase diagram ] we study the onset of global cascades as a function of the network structure by means of numerical simulations and theoretical analysis . in section",
    "[ sec : critical points ] we analyze the presence of tipping points as a function of the network structure and in section [ sec : opt ] we identify the optimal network structures .",
    "finally in section [ sec : conclusions ] we draw some conclusions and perspectives of the present work .",
    "let us recap the linear threshold model @xcite . consider a set of @xmath10 nodes ( agents ) connected by undirected edges of a network .",
    "the state of an agent @xmath11 at time @xmath5 is described by a binary variable @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents the active state and @xmath14 the inactive one . at time @xmath15 a fraction @xmath16 of randomly selected agents , or seeds , is initialized in the active state . at each time step , every agent s state is updated synchronously @xcite , according to the following rule @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the adjacency matrix of the network , @xmath19 is the threshold parameter , and @xmath20 is the degree of the node @xmath11 .",
    "the asymptotic dynamics of this process is described by a fixed point @xcite .",
    "the linearity of the model derives from the functional dependence on the threshold parameter , but the dynamics of the process is clearly non - linear .    in this work",
    "we study the dynamics of ltm on a network generated by a sbm .",
    "the sbm was first studied in mathematical sociology by holland et al .",
    "@xcite and by wang and wong @xcite . in the simplest sbm (",
    "several more complicated variants have been proposed , see @xcite ) , each of @xmath10 vertices is assigned to one of @xmath21 blocks ( or groups ) and undirected edges are placed independently between vertex pairs , with probabilities that are a function only of the group membership of the vertices . if we denote by @xmath22 the group to which vertex @xmath11 belongs , then the @xmath23 affinity matrix @xmath0 is such that the matrix element @xmath24 is the probability of an edge between vertices @xmath11 and @xmath25 .",
    "the vertex assignment is a mapping between integers @xmath26 . in the following we use the integers @xmath27 for a node pair , @xmath28 for a block pair .",
    "@xmath29 denotes the size of block @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "when @xmath32 for all pairs @xmath28 , the sbm reduces to the erds - rnyi random graph model @xmath33 @xcite . if the elements of @xmath0 are not all the same , then the sbm generates erds - rnyi random graphs within each community @xmath30 , with an internal link density given by @xmath34 , and random bipartite graphs between pairs of communities @xmath30 and @xmath35 with link density given by @xmath36 .    in this paper",
    "we study the propagation of information according to the ltm on a network generated by the sbm described by two communities , i.e @xmath37 .",
    "the affinity matrix @xmath0 is thus described by three independent probabilities , since @xmath38 .",
    "the sbm can describe three different network structures : assortative network , disassortative network and core - periphery network . in terms of the affinity matrix ,",
    "the different cases are : @xmath39 the assortative case corresponds to a modular structure where the two blocks are internally strongly connected and in the symmetric case ( @xmath40 ) it is the model considered in @xcite .",
    "the dissasortative structure is approximately bipartite and the majority of connections are between members of different blocks .",
    "finally the in the core - periphery structure one densely connected block is connected with the other group , which internally is very weakly connected    we choose the two communities of the same size , i.e. @xmath41 . the propagation of the information starts at time @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the initial set of informed nodes is located in the community @xmath13 with density @xmath42 , while @xmath43 . the total density of informed nodes of the network",
    "is defined by @xmath44 .",
    "we are interested to study the asymptotic state of the network state , i.e. @xmath45 , for a fixed value of the mean network degree @xmath46 . in the sbm",
    "this constraint is @xmath47      in order to compute the asymptotic densities , we use two approximations : the mean field and the tree - like approximation .",
    "the mean field approach ( mf ) @xcite is a first approximation to study theoretically the asymptotic state of the density of informed nodes on the network .",
    "it makes use only of the information on the degree distribution , assuming that the network is otherwise random . in the case under exam",
    "the nodes of the network are split into two groups with probabilities @xmath48 . in the model considered here",
    "the two communities have the same size @xmath49 , thus @xmath50 .",
    "following daudin et al .",
    "@xcite , the conditional distribution of the degree of a node , given its group label , is binomial ( approximately poisson ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the mean field equations for the asymptotic densities of the informed nodes are @xmath54 @xmath55    the second , more sophisticated but more accurate , approximation is the tree like approximation @xcite .",
    "gleeson et al .",
    "@xcite have derived a class of recursive equations approximating the random network by a tree structure .",
    "the approximation is valid only if the graph is sparse enough , i.e. the network structure is locally a tree because the presence of cycles is unlikely .",
    "the top level of the tree is a single node of degree @xmath8 , this is connected to its @xmath8 neighbors at the next lower level of the tree .",
    "each of these nodes is in turn connected to @xmath56 neighbors at the next lower level , where @xmath20 is the degree of node @xmath11 , and so on .",
    "the degree distribution of the nodes in the tree is a modification of the original @xmath57 , i.e. it is given by @xmath58 . to find the final density @xmath59 of active nodes , we label the levels of the tree from @xmath60 at the bottom , with the top node at an infinitely high level @xmath61 .",
    "the probability @xmath62 that a random node at level @xmath21 of the tree is active is given by @xmath63 @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "this system of equations allows to find the probability that the top node , i.e. that corresponding to @xmath61 , is active .",
    "this probability is used as the probability of having an active node as neighbor of a given node of degree @xmath8 .",
    "this implies different equations for @xmath66 with respect to eq .",
    "[ eq:1.5.0 ] .",
    "the asymptotic densities of informed nodes are given by @xmath67 the nonlinear systems of equations [ eq:1.5.0 ] and [ eq:1.6.0 ] are solved numerically searching for a fixed point in order to find a stable solution .",
    "in this section we investigate the presence of global cascades in the sbm for fixed @xmath68 .",
    "the sbm considered here is characterized by the three parameters of the affinity matrix .",
    "one of them is fixed by the constraint on @xmath46 of eq .",
    "[ eq:1.3 ] , thus the phase space can be represented on the parametric plane @xmath69 .",
    "we use @xmath70 rather than @xmath71 in order to obtain values independent from the network size in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the different network structures described by eq . [ eq:1.2 ] and the constraint on @xmath46 imply a division of the phase space ( plane ) into four regions @xmath74 the conditions on the right of the @xmath75 correspond to @xmath76 , which implies @xmath77 .",

    "[ fig : phase_tot_theta_04_new_2 ] shows the mean value and the standard error of the asymptotic density @xmath88 computed on the different realizations of the same sbm network .",
    "we observe that the phase space is divided in three phases : the first one ( light brown ) is characterized by @xmath89 describes the case when the cascade does not propagate neither in group 1 nor in group 2 .",
    "the second one ( dark brown ) corresponds to @xmath90 describing the case when the cascade invades all the initially informed group 1 , but does not propagate into group 2 ( @xmath91 ) .",

    "the separation between the phases is sharp and fluctuation analysis ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_tot_theta_04_new_2 ] ) indicates that results are very stable with the expected exception of large fluctuations very close to the boundaries between phases .",

    "we have introduced the concept of _ optimal network structure _ as those structures that can lead to global cascades . for a fixed fraction of initially informed nodes ,",

    "the common behavior is described by a sharp transition of the information density , in terms of the density of initiators in the informed community , from an initial uniformed state to a global informed state .",
    "the behavior of the value of critical densities is analyzed as a function of the two dimensional parametric space described above .",
    "both phenomena are described coherently by simulations and analytic approaches , i.e. mean field and tree - like approximations .",
    "the analysis of tipping points is useful to identify optimal structures as those where a minimal number of initially informed nodes is needed to have a global cascade .",
    "we have found that the solution of this optimization are network structures with assortative mixing but very close to a core - periphery structure .",
    "such results can be useful to analyze the diffusion of information in networks described by different communities .",
