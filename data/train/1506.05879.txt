    "majorana bound states ( mbs)@xcite are recently attracting increasing interest both theoretically and experimentally . these have been predicted to exist in artificial structures , such as nanowires with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) in proximity to a superconductor,@xcite ferromagnetic atom chains on top of a superconductor,@xcite topological insulator / superconductor hybrid structures,@xcite and superconducting circuits.@xcite recently , possible signatures of mbs have been reported in nanowires,@xcite atom chains,@xcite and topological insulator / superconductor structures.@xcite the mbs attract considerable attention partly due to their hypothetical non - abelian anyonic statistics , which might allow the realization of topologically - protected quantum information manipulation.@xcite in parallel to the ongoing search of some unambiguous confirmation of mbs,@xcite there are also numerous theoretical studies on how to efficiently exploit these mbs .    one promising application of mbs is to construct majorana qubits.@xcite it has been suggested that majorana qubits might be robust against local perturbations and are hence promising to store quantum information.@xcite ( note that majorana qubits are not totally protected from decoherence , as studied in , e.g. , refs .  . ) furthermore , majorana qubits could be rotated by topologically - protected braiding operations.@xcite therefore , among various realizations of qubits,@xcite majorana qubits are considered to be promising candidates for building blocks of quantum information processors .",
    "the braiding operations alone are insufficient to realize a universal quantum gate based on a majorana qubit.@xcite for the implementation of arbitrary qubit rotations , other non - topological operations are required .",
    "several schemes of such non - topological operations assisted by , e.g. , phase gates,@xcite quantum dots,@xcite flux qubits,@xcite or microwave cavities,@xcite have been proposed in the literature .",
    "nanomechanical resonators@xcite could also be used to study non - topological operations of a majorana qubit .",

    "this work aims to contribute to this field . in this paper , we propose another majorana qubit - nanomechanical resonator hybrid system in the framework of the spin - boson model,@xcite based on a semiconductor nanowire in proximity to an s - wave superconductor . we show that a strong coupling between a nanomechanical resonator and a majorana qubit can be achieved , allowing an efficient transfer of quantum information between these two quantum systems .",

    ", we consider the case with @xmath10 , where @xmath6 is the chemical potential in the nanowire .",

    "this is because @xmath116 .",
    "therefore , the dashed curves in fig .  4 , representing the time evolution of the phonon number , also supply information on the change of the oscillation amplitude of the resonator due to its coupling with the qubit .",

    "specifically , in ref .  5 , a certain equilibrium angle ( @xmath119 there ) of the vibrating cantilever has to be established . in our opinion , exactly solving this angle and then adjusting the experimental setup correspondingly@xcite are challenging",
    ". however , in order to neglect the constant off - diagonal term in our case , the experimental setup must be mirror - symmetric about the middle point of the fm2 gate , i.e. , @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , we think that our model is more easily accessible by experiments and hence more advantageous .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a hybrid system composed of a majorana qubit and a mechanical resonator , implemented by a semiconductor nanowire in proximity to an s - wave superconductor . in this proposal ,",
    "three ferromagnetic gates are placed on top of and along the nanowire ; the two outer gates are static and the inner one is free to oscillate harmonically as a mechanical resonator .",
    "these ferromagnetic gates induce a local zeeman splitting and give rise to four majorana bound states , constituting a majorana qubit in the nanowire .",
    "the dynamical hybridization of the majorana bound states , arising from the motion of the oscillating gate , results in a coherent coupling between the majorana qubit and the mechanical resonator .",
    "this hybrid system can be adjusted to be in resonance , e.g. , with the assistance of a gate voltage on the ferromagnetic gates , which controls the rashba soc locally in the nanowire .",
    "our study reveals that under resonance , a strong coupling between the qubit and the resonator can be achieved .",
    "consequently , quantum information can be effectively transferred from the majorana qubit to the oscillator and then back to the qubit .",
    "this quantum information transfer can manifest itself in modulating the motion of the oscillator , which may conversely signify the presence of the majorana qubit .",

    "<S> the ferromagnetic gates induce majorana bound states in the nanowire , which hybridize and constitute a majorana qubit . due to the oscillation of one of these gates , the majorana qubit can be coherently rotated . by tuning the gate voltage to modulate the local spin - orbit coupling , it is possible to reach the resonance of the qubit - oscillator system for relatively strong couplings . </S>"
