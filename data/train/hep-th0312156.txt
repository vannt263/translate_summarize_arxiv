    "ads backgrounds of string theory are often fruitful arenas for studying holographic dualities and for constructing sigma models with r - r fluxes , among other things . ads backgrounds of type 0a string theory should be no exception . in particular , the recent discovery of a matrix quantum mechanics dual to two - dimensional type 0a string theory @xcite suggests a promising direction for understanding ads@xmath0/cft@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "also , two - dimensional ads presents one of the simplest backgrounds in which to study sigma models in r - r flux .    as a first step in these pursuits ,",
    "we present here a two - parameter family of ads@xmath0 solutions to the two - dimensional type 0a effective action .",
    "one of the parameters is the tachyon vev @xmath2 ( equivalently , the ratio of dualized r - r field strengths , @xmath3 ) .",
    "the other parameter is the string coupling @xmath4 ( equivalently , the magnitude of the field strength @xmath5 ) . in these solutions ,",
    "string loops can be suppressed by reducing the string coupling , but the high curvature of the spaces makes higher order @xmath6 corrections important .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly review the 2d 0a string theory . in section 3",
    ", we present our family of ads@xmath0 solutions . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss possible corrections to our solutions from higher order terms in the effective action .",
    "the ten - dimensional type 0a string theory is given by the same worldsheet action as the type iia string , but with a gso projection onto the closed string sectors @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the eigenvalue of the worldsheet fermion number operator @xmath10 . in ten dimensions ,",
    "each of these sectors contains a tower of states corresponding to the possible transverse oscillations . in two dimensions ,",
    "however , there is no room for transverse oscillations , so the situation is much simpler .",
    "we have the graviton @xmath11 and dilaton @xmath12 in the ( ns@xmath8,ns@xmath8 ) sector , the tachyon @xmath2 in the ( ns@xmath9,ns@xmath9 ) sector , and two gauge fields @xmath13 from the r - r sectors that give rise to two field strengths , @xmath14 . an allowed background for this theory",
    "is the two - dimensional linear dilaton vacuum ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) with an exponential tachyon wall ( @xmath17 ) and zero field strengths ( @xmath18 ) . the worldsheet action for this string theory is the action of @xmath19 super liouville theory plus the action for a free scalar superfield .",
    "the action for @xmath20 super liouville theory can be written in superfield formalism for both the liouville superfield and the background dilaton . ] as @xmath21 where @xmath12 is the scalar superfield @xmath22 and the covariant derivatives are given by @xmath23 in the case @xmath24 , this yields a theory with central charge @xmath25 . when combined with the @xmath26 theory of a free scalar superfield @xmath27 with action @xmath28 we get a critical scft with central charge @xmath29 .",
    "this is the worldsheet action for two - dimensional type 0a in the linear dilaton vacuum .",
    "the effective spacetime action was calculated in @xcite and was found to be @xmath30\\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the first few terms in a taylor expansion of the @xmath31 functions are @xmath32 there is evidence that the exact expression for @xmath33 is @xmath34 @xcite , and we will use this form for @xmath35 in our calculations .",
    "to simplify the action ( [ spacetimeaction ] ) , we will dualize the r - r field strengths : @xmath36 in the second line , we have introduced an auxiliary field @xmath37 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath37 is @xmath38 which , when substituted in , gives the original action . in the third line , we have integrated out @xmath39 which constrains @xmath37 to be a constant . therefore",
    ", in the third line , the fields @xmath39 and @xmath37 are no longer functionally integrated . the full action can now be written as @xmath40 \\ , .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    varying with respect to the metric @xmath11 , dilaton @xmath12 , and tachyon @xmath2 gives the equations of motion @xmath41 \\\\",

    "this implies that higher order @xmath6 terms in the effective action will be important .",
    "this will be addressed in section 4 .",
    "also , note that we are free to tune the string coupling to zero by ramping up the strength of the r - r flux .    in this case",
    ", the `` tachyon '' is massive for all values of @xmath54 .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the @xmath55 equation of motion , to first order in @xmath2 , gives us @xmath56 the @xmath57 equation of motion , to zero order in @xmath2 , tells us that @xmath58 and , when substituted into the linearized @xmath55 equation , gives us @xmath59 finally , substituting our background expressions for @xmath12 and @xmath60 , we get @xmath61 so that the tachyon mass is @xmath62 .",
    "the authors of @xcite noted that , in ten dimensions , r - r flux could stabilize the tachyon potential . in our two - dimensional case",
    ", we see that the r - r flux makes the otherwise - massless tachyon massive .",
    "solutions to the wave equation in ads@xmath0 are most readily attained in poincare coordinates , in which @xmath63 in these coordinates , the wave equation takes the form @xmath64 using separation of variables , we can write the general time - dependent , positive - frequency solution as @xmath65 . the normalizable solution is readily obtained in terms of a bessel function as @xmath66 where @xmath67 .",
    "the static solutions are obtained by noting that the wave equation @xmath68 implies that @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the general static solution is @xmath71 note that , although these static solutions are non - normalizable , they may make an appearance as approximate solutions in regions of spacetime that are ads - like .",
    "solutions to the wave equation in global coordinates are a little more difficult to come by , but they have been worked out in @xcite . in",
    "the global coordinates @xmath72 the normalized positive - frequency solutions are @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 is the gegenbauer polynomial , and @xmath76 is once again related to @xmath77 by @xmath78 . note that , unlike in poincare coordinates , the spectrum in global coordinates is discrete .",
    "the solution given in the previous section can be deformed by moving the constant value of @xmath2 away from zero .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 again , it is clear that , for all solutions in this family , we can send the string coupling to zero while holding fixed both the tachyon vev @xmath2 and the ads radius @xmath83 .",
    "this is accomplished by sending @xmath84 and @xmath85 to infinity while holding the ratio @xmath86 fixed .",
    "it is not evident from these equations whether or not there exists an ads@xmath0 solution with one of the @xmath54 s , say @xmath87 , set to zero .",
    "setting @xmath88 would require a @xmath2 of order 1 , but to understand such large values of @xmath2 would require a more complete knowledge of @xmath89 .",
    "specifically , @xmath88 would require that @xmath90 and it is not known whether this equation has solutions .",
    "it should be noted that the ads spaces presented here are solutions to the first few terms in the effective action . since the ads radius is of order the string length ,",
    "we expect higher order terms in @xmath6 to change some of the quantitative features of the solutions , such as the exact value of the ads radius or the true mass of the tachyon . however , as we shall discuss here , the qualitative features of the ads solutions are rather generic and are not expected to be changed by the higher order @xmath6 terms",
    ".    we can ask what other terms might make contributions to the equations of motion , and , therefore , might change features of the ads solution . for simplicity ,",
    "let us concentrate on the @xmath50 solution found in section 3.3 .",
    "since we seek a solution with @xmath12 constant and @xmath2 zero , any terms linear or higher order in @xmath91 or @xmath2 will make no contribution to the @xmath92 or @xmath57 equation of motion . therefore , the only higher order ns - ns terms that will contribute are contractions of the riemann tensor .",
    "since we are in two dimensions , the riemann tensor is related to the ricci scalar as @xmath93 as a result , any scalar combination of @xmath94 riemann tensors can be rewritten as @xmath95 for some constant @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we may consider replacing @xmath60 in the effective action with @xmath97 . in our @xmath50 solution",
    ", these terms will change equation ( [ radiusequation ] ) to @xmath98 so long as there are real roots to this equation , then there will exist an ads solution with the corresponding radius .",
    "the equation ( [ dilatonequation ] ) for the string coupling is modified to @xmath99 once again , it is clear that the string coupling may be taken to zero by making @xmath100 large .",
    "the @xmath55 equation of motion is , of course , unaffected by these @xmath101 terms . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath55 equation will be affected by terms in the action that are linear in @xmath2 . however , there are no ns - ns terms involving odd powers of @xmath2 @xcite",
    ". terms with odd powers of @xmath2 are possible when they also involve r - r fields , for example , the @xmath102 terms",
    ". however , the proposed symmetry @xcite of the theory under @xmath103 and @xmath104 would imply that setting @xmath105 makes such terms zero",
    ".    we may also ask how the tachyon mass would be altered by the terms higher order in @xmath6 . for example , ns - ns terms of the form @xmath106 would change the tachyon mass . in fact , we fully expect the value of the tachyon mass to be corrected by higher order terms .",
    "it is clear that the form of the ads solutions are rather generic and are not likely to be dramatically changed by terms higher order in @xmath6 .",
    "this fact motivates a search for the corresponding worldsheet sigma model describing type 0a strings propagating in these ads@xmath0 spaces . because of the existence of nonzero r - r fluxes",
    ", the correct sigma model will most likely not be found using the nsr formalism .",
    "fortunately , several other worldsheet formalisms have been developed that have allowed for quantization of the string in r - r backgrounds .",
    "for example , the hybrid formalism has been used to study superstring quantization in ads@xmath107 @xmath108 s@xmath109 @xcite , ads@xmath0 @xmath108 s@xmath110 backgrounds @xcite , and curved 2d backgrounds @xcite .",
