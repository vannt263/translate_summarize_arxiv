    "the c , mg , and ca abundances can be attributed to a low energy pop iii sne and measurement of the oxygen abundance , in particular , offers an important test of this scenario .",
    "to measure the oxygen abundance in ultra - metal poor k stars , however , it is necessary to work in the ultra - violet and observe the oh lines that persist well after the [ oi ] @xmath18 line has become undetectable .",
    "in order to measure the oh ( and ch ) lines between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and obtain better detection limits on n , na , v , co , ni , fe , and cu , we used uves ( ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph ; @xcite ) on the vlt ( eso very large telescope ) at paranal in chile . between september 2013 and september 2014 ,",
    "31 exposures totalling @xmath21 hours of on - source integration were obtained . the uves uv spectrum extended from @xmath1 to @xmath22 and the two red spectra from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",

    "one of us ( rc ) generated a 3d time - dependent hydrodynamic model atmosphere of a red giant star with stellar parameters very similar to the ones of sm0313@xmath06708 using a custom version of the stagger code @xcite as well as a 1d model atmosphere corresponding to the same parameters and relying on the same micro - physics and opacity data .",

    "the poorer fit of the deep oh and ch lines in fig .",
    "[ fig:3110 ] is likely due to limitations with the adopted 1d model atmosphere .",
    "our computations of ch , nh , and oh lines have been carried out in lte , but in low - density atmospheres it is possible that non - lte processes may be important for cooling the outer stellar layers @xcite and for affecting the strength of molecular bands . as no study of non - lte ch , nh , and oh line formation is available in the literature , however , we are unable to quantify non - lte effects on cno abundances derived from these molecular bands .      in order to put limits on the @xmath52 ratio we used two regions of the spectrum where the @xmath35ch and @xmath36ch lines are well separated and free from blending .",
    "there were five strong lines in the b - x region and nine in the a - x region .",
    "sections of spectrum centered on each of the lines were extracted and summed in both the observed spectrum and the synthetic spectra .",
    "the summed observed and synthetic @xmath35ch lines were in good agreement but no @xmath36ch feature was evident in the summed spectrum .",
    "this allows us to place a three sigma lower limit of about @xmath53 for the @xmath52 ratio .",
    "this low value of @xmath36c is consistent with massive population iii star yields with no or little primary nitrogen production @xcite .",
    "two of the fei transitions with the largest @xmath54 values in the observed spectral range are located within the highest s / n portion of the uv spectrum , at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "the non - detection of lines of sc , ti , v , co , ni , and cu in the uves spectrum in the range from @xmath58   to @xmath59   provided revised lower upper limits for many elements given in table  [ tab : abu ] ( frebel et al .",

    "the non - detection of the sii line at @xmath60 in the blue mike spectrum indicates an upper limit of @xmath61 .",
    "the uves red spectrum was in good agreement with the mike spectrum for the mgi lines and the lii line , but the better s / n and weaker telluric lines in the uves red spectrum indicates that the na limit could be lowered to about @xmath62 .",
    "table  [ tab : abu ] lists the current best estimates for the chemical abundances of sm0313@xmath06708 .",
    "@xcite have followed the evolution and explosion of metal - free stars with masses @xmath63 to @xmath64 and determined their nucleosynthetic yields , light curves , and remnant masses .",
    "such stars would have been the first to form after the big bang and could have left a distinctive imprint on the composition of the early universe .",
    "the evolution of these stars may be affected in several ways by their zero - metallicity primordial composition . because these stars suffered little mass - loss during their pre - explosive lifetimes , their masses at their deaths were larger than more metal - rich stars .",
    "the models produces some carbon , but for masses less than about @xmath65 primary production of nitrogen is suppressed .",
    "these stars ended their lives as compact blue supergiants making their envelope more tightly bound , with two interesting consequences : _",
    "i ) _ the more compact envelope increases the amount of mass that falls back after the explosion , meaning that they were more likely to collapse to black holes at lower masses compared to modern stars , trapping most of the heavy elements ; _ ii ) _ mixing by the rayleigh - taylor instabilities is suppressed in these compact stars , so it is mainly unmixed material that escapes in the explosion . @xcite fitted their predicted nucleosynthetic yields to several examples of metal - poor stars and found that the best fits were obtained from relatively low energy explosions of @xmath66 ( @xmath67erg ) as compared to hypernova models @xcite .",
    "overall , the large sample of metal - poor stars in @xcite was well fit with a normal salpeter imf including all stars from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ( but with a preference for stars lighter than @xmath68 ) , a small amount of fallback and with reduced mixing of @xmath69 of the helium core mass ( for reference , the default mixing value adopted to solar metallicity stars is @xmath70 of the helium core mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "for the two ultra - iron - poor , but high @xmath71 , stars he 0107@xmath05240 @xcite and he 1327@xmath02326 @xcite , the best fits were for similar low energy explosions , a lower upper mass range ( @xmath63 to less than @xmath72 ) , small fallback and an even lower mixing of @xmath73 .",
    "the abundances of sm0313@xmath06708 are much more extreme than the @xcite emp stars or the two c - rich ultra - emp stars .",
    "the biggest difference are the large carbon , oxygen and magnesium overabundances relative to calcium , and the non - detection of all other metals .",

    "the fraction of the c and o layers that are ejected varies strongly for a given explosion energy and is rather sensitive to mass and explosion energy .",

    "the new lower value of @xmath81 $ ] derived here strengthens the constraint _ not _ to eject iron group elements from the inner core of the progenitor star .",
    "this limits the explosion energy and the magnitude of mixing due to raleigh - taylor instabilities during the sn explosion . @xcite",

    "their best - fit models assume that the explosions undergo extensive matter mixing and fallback , leaving behind a black hole remnant . in these models ,",
    "ca is produced by static / explosive o burning and incomplete si burning in the population iii supernova / hypernova , in contrast to our suggestion that the ca originates from the hot - cno cycle during pre - supernova evolution , which is , remarkably , consistent with the present data .",
    "although @xcite well fits the observed abundances , their modelling uses several independent free parameters .",
    "for example , their models require significantly more mixing than is consistent with hydrodynamical simulations of population iii stars @xcite and the fallback is adjusted independently of the explosion energy . jetted or asymmetric explosions may be a possibility",
    ", however , this is another free parameter . in the @xcite models",
    "the mixing is consistent with hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite and the fallback is computed self - consistently with the explosion energy .",
    "fuller discussion of the abundances of sm0313 - 6708 and sn modelling will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the ultraviolet spectrum of sm0313@xmath06708 is dominated by the lines of the oh a - x band which are noticeably stronger than the ch c - x lines .",
    "the new line lists of masseron fit the oh and ch lines very well in both wavelength and strength . we could detect no lines of @xmath36ch , which places a limit of more than @xmath53 on @xmath52 , and no lines of nh putting nitrogen at least two orders of magnitude less than c and o. this supports there having been no mixing from the h - burning shell to the surface within sm0313@xmath06708 and there being little nitrogen relative to c and o in the material from which sm0313@xmath06708 formed .",
    "the clear lack of any metal lines apart from mgi in the uves ultraviolet spectrum also enabled us to lower the abundance limits for those elements whose strong lines are normally seen in this region , including fei , for which we now derive an @xmath4}}}}$ ] upper limit of @xmath87 ( @xmath5 ) from @xmath88 lte analysis .",
    "we derived an [ @xmath2 ratio of @xmath49 with a @xmath89 uncertainty of @xmath50 for sm0313@xmath06708 , updated abundances measurements for mg and ca , and derived new upper limits for nitrogen , the fe - group elements and some of the alpha - elements .",
    "these abundances remain consistent with a single massive population iii progenitor in the mass range @xmath75 , low mixing , and modest explosion energies ; the ca production remains consistent with an origin from hydrostatic hydrogen burning . improved upper limits on intermediate - mass elements , in particular na and al , will further help constrain the models in the future .",
