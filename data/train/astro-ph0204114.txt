    "substellar dwarfs or brown dwarfs are objects whose masses are too low to burn hydrogen at their cores .",
    "the mass could range between 0.075m@xmath1 to 0.002m@xmath1 ( late m , l and t type stars , see for eg : kirkpatrick & mccarthy 1994 , burrows et .",
    "1997 , kirkpatrick et .",
    "1999a , basri 2000 ) . in the last few years",
    "ultracool dwarfs have discovered from the 2mass , sloan and denis surveys ( kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1999a , 2000 , strauss et al . 1999 , fan et al . 2000 , and delfosse et al .",
    "these extensive works helped in establishing spectral signatures of ultracool dwarfs and classifications of m , l and t spectral types ( also see reid et al . 2001 and leggett et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , determining the intrinsic properties of brown dwarfs is difficult because their luminosity and effective temperatures are function of age and mass ( burrows et al .",
    "1997 , baraffe et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore ,",
    "finding such objects in binary systems containing a main sequence star would be of great interest because both these parameters can be determined reasonably accurately .",
    "indeed , the first discovered undisputed brown dwarf is a companion to m1v star gl229 ( nakajima et al .",
    "1995 ) . also , the coronographic palomar survey ( oppenheimer et al . 2001 ) which goes 4 absolute magnitudes fainter than gl229b , discovered at least seven new faint companions of nearby stars .",
    "we have started a high angular resolution (= 030 ) search for faint companions at nir wavelengths around g or k type stars in the solar neighborhood , as well as in the nearby young star clusters like mbm12 and mbm20 ( hearty et al .",
    "2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "the list consisted of stars with ages from 100 myrs to a few gyrs using ground based telescope equipped with adaptive optics . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of two faint companions to main sequence stars : hd190067 and hip13855 .",
    "this is a result of our first limited survey done using the 100 inch ( 2.5 m ) telescope of mt.wilson .",
    "the h and k photometric observations were performed in october 2001 at the 100 inch telescope of mt.wilson using its natural star adaptive optics ( ao ) system ( shelton et al .",
    "1995 ) and the penn state ir imager and spectrograph ( piris , ge et al .",
    "the detector is a 256@xmath2256 picnic array with pixel size of 40 microns .",
    "the gain and the read noise of the camera are 4.0 @xmath3 and 20 electrons respectively .",
    "the plate scale was 0082 per pixel providing a field of view of 210 .",
    "the filters used were standard astronomical h & k filters . a cold pupil mask located in the pupil plane inside",
    "the dewar reduces the thermal background particularly in the k band .",
    "the camera will soon be equipped for nir spectroscopy with @xmath4 by commercially available fused silica grisms and high @xmath5 using silicon grisms developed at penn state ( ge et al .",
    "2000 , ge et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "we observed six young solar analogs from gaidos et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , a couple of main sequence stars with faint companions ( turner et al .",
    "2001 ) and six main sequence stars towards the mbm12 star forming cloud ( hearty et al .",
    "2000a&b ) .",
    "the observations were done under photometric condition with sub arcsec seeing .",
    "the average fwhm of the point spread function ( psf ) was 030 after the ao correction .",
    "we report here the observations of two stars hd190067 ( spectral type g8 , duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) and hip13855 ( spectral type g0 , hearty et al .",
    "2000b ) which are associated with faint companions ( hd190067b and hip13855b ) .",
    "we discuss the nature of these faint companions and determine their possibility of being substellar , transition or late m dwrafs close to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "the total integration in @xmath6 and @xmath7 bands for hd190067 was of 20 s ( 5 co - added 4 s exposures ) and 50 s ( 5 co - added 10 s exposures ) for hip13855 .",
    "an appropriate number of sky frames ( 5 ) were observed immediately after the object observations for proper sky subtraction .",
    "flats were made by combining several ( 15 ) sky frames .",
    "two standard stars hd225023 and sao056596 , were observed from the ukirt standard star list and hunt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) respectively for determining the zero point of the camera in each filter before or after the observation of the program stars .",
    "each frame was sky subtracted and flat fielded before co - adding .",
    "photometry was performed on both individual frames as well as in the total co - added frames to estimate the total photometric error .",
    "photometric analysis was carried out using the standard daophot routine of iraf . while primarily we",
    "did aperture photometry after determining the width of the psf using phot task , we also performed photometry of the faint companion hip13855b after subtracting the psf fitted bright primary hip13855a using psf and allstar tasks .",
    "this procedure was necessary because the separation between a and b components of hip13855 is only 05 .",
    "a gaussian psf was constructed considering an isolated bright star .",
    "the photon noise correspond to an error of @xmath80.02 mag in the individual images .",
    "however , we estimated the maximum error by computing the magnitudes from five different frames to be @xmath80.1 mag and the mean magnitude from five frames is the same as the magnitude estimated from the co - added frames .",
    "this relatively high error could be due to the ao system and in the present work we will limit the uncertainty to @xmath80.1 mag .",
    "table 1 gives the value of magnitudes estimated from the co - added frames .",
    "we note that the source seen as a faint companion to hip13855 with a separation of 05 is real and not an artifact like ghost .",
    "other stars observed under similar conditions including the standard stars do not show any such point source which is 5 magnitude fainter than the primary .",
    "we compared our @xmath6 and @xmath7 photometry of hip13855a with that given in the 2mass point source catalogue .",
    "the 2mass h and ks magnitudes of hip13855 ( a+b ) is 7.29 and 7.25 respectively .",
    "we find that if we consider a larger aperture ( 3 arcsec ) comparable to the 2mass psf , then we do get similar values in h and k bands ( 7.4 and 7.3 respectively ) within the our photometric errors stated earlier .",
    "the photometric results of hd190067 , hip13855 and their respective companions are presented in table 1 .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of the faint companions are calculated assuming the distances given in the hipparcos catalogue .",
    "a@xmath9 values towards these sources from the literature are negligible compared to the overall photometric error ( @xmath80.1 mag ) and hence are not considered for absolute magnitude estimation .",
    "the @xmath10 values were estimated from the @xmath11 values found in the literature for hip13855 ( luhman 2001 ) ; for hd190067 mean extinction in the galaxy was considered for a distance of 19 pc ( glass 1999 ) , and using the relation @xmath12 = 0.142 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "thus the estimated @xmath10 values for hip13855 and hd190067 were 0.028 and 0.01 magnitudes .",
    "figures 1 & 2 show h and k images of hd190067 and hip13855 along with their faint companions respectively .",
    "hip13855 is at a distance of 74 pc ( hipparcos catalogue ) a foreground star towards the star forming cloud mbm12 , whose distance is estimated to be somewhere between 90 pc to 275 pc ( luhman 2001 ) .",
    "mbm 12 cloud contain very young stars with ages 10 to 100 myrs ( hearty et al .",
    "some members of the mbm12 cluster , however , are much closer ; for example , hd17332 is at a distance of 33 pc ( hipparcos catalogue ) .",
    "hd17332 is a young g1v star , since lithium is detected in its spectrum ( hearty et al .",
    "we qualitatively argue on the basis of its proximity that hip13855 could be associated with the mbm12 cluster ; however , there is no record of lithium detection in its spectrum .",
    "so we assume a lower limit for the age of hip13855 could be 100 myrs ( hearty et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) developed models for young substellar dwarfs of various ages that show a similar trend of absolute magnitudes vs nir infrared colors for young substellar dwarfs that are less than 1.0 gyrs .",
    "similar models of evolution of brown dwarfs and low mass stars with a time scale from less than 100 myrs to 10 gyrs have shown that the hydrogen burning limit is somewhere between 0.072 to 0.075@xmath0 and the corresponding spectral type varies with age ( m6.5 at 100 myrs to l4 at 10gyrs ( baraffe et al . 1998 and 2001 , kirkpatrick 1999b , basri 2000 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows such evolution model curves from baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 and 2001 ) and overlaying on it are the results of the present work .",
    "we discuss below the nature of the newly discovered companion based on their ages and absolute @xmath6 magnitude .",
    "hd190067 is at a distance of 19 pc ( hipparcos catalogue ) .",
    "the possible binary nature was first reported by turner et al .",
    ". however , they could not confirm it due to lack of information on common proper motion .",
    "we detect the binary component hd190067b at a separation of 290 which is 004 more than previous observed separation in 1996 by turner et al .",
    "hd190067 should have moved by 051 between these two set of observations due to its proper motion alone .",
    "thus , it appears that hd190067 and its faint companion has similar proper motion and establish that hd190067b is a physical binary .",
    "however , the observed pa in 1996 was 82 degrees while in 2001 ( present work ) we find it to be 75 degrees ( see table 1 )",
    ". this difference could be due to the orbital motion of the secondary .",
    "we will need more such observations to determine the orbital period and the mass of the secondary .",
    "we estimate the absolute h magnitude m@xmath13 = 9.3@xmath80.1 and a @xmath14 color of 1.1@xmath80.2 .",
    "kirkpatrick & mccarthy ( 1994 ) showed from @xmath15 photometry and optical spectroscopy that young stars ( less than 0.5 gyrs ) of spectral type m6.5 and later can not burn hydrogen in their core .",
    "these measurements suggest that hd190067b could be a transition candidate if it is young ( less than 0.5 gyrs ) . however , if it is older , then it is a low mass star close to the hydrogen burning limit . from figure 3",
    "the mass of hd190067b may be 0.08@xmath0 to 0.1@xmath0(also see figure 3 ) .",
    "the high h - k color ( 1.1@xmath80.2 ) is intriguing .",
    "a high h - k color is common for late l type substellar dwarfs reid et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but a late l type source is expected to be more than a magnitude fainter in @xmath16 ( kirkpatrick et al . 2000 ) .",
    "nir spectroscopic observations will be necessary to accurately determine the spectral type .",
    "we find a faint companion of hip13855 with a separation of 05 whose h and k magnitudes are 12.6 and 12.6 respectively .",
    "these yield @xmath17 to be 8.3@xmath80.1 for the hip13855b .",
    "figure 3 shows that the companion could have mass in the range of 0.1@xmath0 to 0.2@xmath0 .",
    "we find the @xmath14 color of hip13855b to be 0.0@xmath80.2 mag .",
    "therefore , if the system is a physical binary ( common proper motion yet to be confirmed ) then hip13855b is a young late m dwarf .",
    "spectroscopic observations will be helpful to probe further into its nature .",
