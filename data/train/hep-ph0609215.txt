    "the unusual properties of @xmath0 state , recently discovered in the decay @xmath5 , invited some speculations regarding its possible non-@xmath6 nature  @xcite . since its mass lies tantalizingly close to the @xmath7 threshold of 3871.3  mev , it is tempting to interpret @xmath0 as a @xmath7 molecule with @xmath8 quantum numbers@xcite .",
    "such molecular states can be studied using techniques of effective field theories ( eft ) .",
    "this study is possible due to the multitude of scales present in qcd .",
    "the extreme smallness of the binding energy , @xmath9 , suggests that this state can play the role of the `` deuteron ''  @xcite in meson - antimeson interactions .",
    "this fact allows us to use methods similar to those developed for the description of the deuteron@xcite , with the added benefit of heavy - quark symmetry .",
    "a suitable effective lagrangian describing such a system contains only heavy - meson degrees of freedom with interactions approximated by local four - boson terms constrained only by the symmetries of the theory . while the predictive power of this approach is somewhat limited , several model - independent statements can be made .",
    "for instance , possible existence of a molecular state in @xmath7 channel does not imply a molecular state in @xmath10 or @xmath3 channels .",
    "the tiny binding energy of this molecular state introduces an energy scale which is much smaller than the mass of the lightest particle , the pion , whose exchange can provide binding .",
    "this fact presents a problem with a straightforward eft analysis of this bound state , which can be illustrated in the following example .",
    "consider a low - energy s - wave scattering amplitude @xmath11 of two heavy mesons with momentum @xmath12 ( ignore spin for a moment ) , [ scatamp ] a(k ) = = , where @xmath13 is a scattering length , which is related to the binding energy @xmath14 of a meson - antimeson bound state as @xmath15 .",
    "naturally , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass of exchanged particle that provides binding .",
    "scattering amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ scatamp ] ) can be obtained from an effective lagrangian expressed in terms of only heavy - meson degrees of freedom as a power series in momentum @xmath12 , [ expscatamp ] a(k ) = _",
    "k^n = - , where @xmath18 are the coefficients of that effective lagrangian .",
    "a problem with a simple application of eft is apparent , as @xmath19 for @xmath20 , making the series convergence in eq .",
    "( [ expscatamp ] ) problematic . indeed , @xmath21",
    "mev@xmath22 for x(3872 ) , which is much larger than the inverse masses of possible exchange particles , @xmath23  mev@xmath22 , @xmath24  mev@xmath22 , etc .",
    "this implies that all - order resummation of @xmath25 series is required . in eft language",
    "this would imply resummation of a class of `` bubble '' graphs , whose vertices are defined by @xmath18 .",
    "the general effective lagrangian required for description of @xmath7 molecular state and consistent with heavy - quark spin and chiral symmetries can be written as@xcite [ lagr ] l = l_1+l_2 , where the two - body piece @xmath26 describes the interactions between heavy meson degrees of freedom .",
    "the one - body piece @xmath27 describes strong interactions of the heavy mesons @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) containing one heavy quark @xmath31 and is well known@xcite : [ lagr2 ] l_1 = - + + ... where the ellipsis denotes higher - order terms in chiral expansion , or describing pion-@xmath32 interactions and antimeson degrees of freedom @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "a superfield describing the doublet of pseudoscalar heavy - meson fields @xmath35 and their vector counterparts with @xmath36 , is defined as @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the second term in eq .  ( [ lagr2 ] ) accounts for the @xmath38 mass difference @xmath39 .",
    "the two - body piece is@xcite [ lagr4 ] l_2=&- & + & - & .",
    "heavy - quark spin symmetry implies that the same lagrangian governs the four - boson interactions of _ all _ @xmath40 states .",
    "indeed , not all of these states are bound . here",
    "we shall concentrate on @xmath0 , which we assume to be a bound state of two _ neutral _ bosons , @xmath41@xcite . evaluating the traces yields for the @xmath42 sector [ locallagr ] l_2,dd^",
    "* = & - & c_1 d^(c ) d^(c ) d^*()_d^ * ( ) - c_1 d^*(c)_d^*(c ) d^ ( ) d^ ( ) + & + & c_2 d^(c ) d^*(c)_d^ * ( ) d^ ( ) + c_2 d^ * ( c)_d^(c ) d^ ( ) d^ * ( ) +  as we show later , the resulting binding energy depends on a _ linear combination _ of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "similarly , one obtains the component lagrangian governing the interactions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , [ locallagrpp ] l_2,dd = c_1 d^(c ) d^(c ) d^ ( ) d^ ( ) .",
    "clearly , one can not relate the existence of the bound state in the @xmath42 and @xmath47 channels , as the properties of the latter will depend only on @xmath43 .",
    "the lowest - energy bound state of @xmath45 and @xmath48 is an eigenstate of charge conjugation , [ eigenstate ] |x_=. to find the bound - state energy of @xmath0 with @xmath8 , we shall look for a pole of the transition amplitude @xmath49 . defining @xmath50-@xmath50 transition amplitudes , [ ts ] t_11&=&d^ * | t | d^ * , t_12=d^ * | t | d ^ * , + t_21&=&d ^*| t | d^ * , t_22=d ^*| t | d ^ * , we also have to include a `` bubble '' resummation of loop contributions , as existence of a bound state is related to a breakdown of perturbative expansion@xcite .",
    "these amplitudes satisfy a system of lippmann - schwinger equations@xcite . in an algebraic matrix form , [ lsematrix ] (    c t_11 + t_12 + t_21 + t_22    ) = (    c -c_1 + c_2 + c_2 + -c_1    ) + i (    cccc -c_1 & c_2 & 0 & 0 + c_2 & -c_1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & -c_1 & c_2 + 0 & 0 & c_2 & -c_1    ) (    c t_11 + t_12 + t_21 + t_22    ) .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ lsematrix ] ) produces the @xmath51 amplitude , [ solution ] t_++= ( t_11+t_12+t_21+t_22 ) = , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is a ( divergent ) integral [ integral ] = 2 ^_dd^ * + = - ^_dd^ * || .",
    "here @xmath54 , with @xmath55 being the reduced mass of the @xmath50 system . the divergence of the integral of eq .  ( [ integral ] )",
    "is removed by renormalization .",
    "we chose to define a renormalized @xmath56 within the @xmath57 subtraction scheme in dimensional regularization , which does not introduce any new dimensionfull scales into the problem . in this scheme",
    "the integral @xmath53 is finite , which corresponds to an implicit subtraction of power divergences in eq .",
    "( [ integral ] ) .",
    "this implies for the transition amplitude [ finamp ] t_++= .",
    "the position of the pole of the molecular state on the energy scale can be read off eq .",
    "( [ finamp ] ) , [ pole ] e_pole=- . recalling the definition of binding energy @xmath14 and that @xmath58 = @xmath59 + @xmath60 , we infer [ binding ] e_b=. assuming @xmath14 = 0.5 mev , which is one sigma below the central value  @xcite , and the experimental values for the masses  @xcite , we obtain @xmath61 .",
    "similar considerations apply to @xmath62 state , in which case the starting point is the lagrangian term in eq .",
    "( [ locallagrpp ] ) .",
    "since it involves only a single term , the calculations are actually easier and involve only one lippmann - schwinger equation .",
    "the resulting binding energy is then@xcite [ bindingc ] e_b=. examining eq .",
    "( [ bindingc ] ) we immediately notice that the existence of a bound state in the @xmath63 channel does not dictate the properties of a possible bound state in the @xmath62 or @xmath64 channels , since @xmath43 and @xmath44 are generally not related to each other .    if we assume that the orthogonal state with @xmath65 is not bound , which is consistent with all the existing experimental observations , we can place some separate constraints on the renormalized values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the amplitude orthogonal to @xmath51 , [ ortho ] t_=x_-|t|x_-= ( t_11-t_12+t_21-t_22 ) = , with @xmath66 , does not have a pole that corresponds to a bound state if @xmath67 .",
    "the exclusion of the @xmath68 state together with the assumption of the existence of the @xmath69 state limits the ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) parameter space as shown in fig .",
    "we introduced an effective field theory approach in the analysis of the likely molecular state @xmath0 .",
    "we described its binding interaction with contact terms in a heavy - quark symmetric lagrangian .",
    "the flexibility of this description allows us to ignore the details of the interaction and to concentrate on its effects , namely a shallow bound state and a large scattering length .",
    "we found that the existence of the bound state in the @xmath63 channel does not in general exclude a possibility of a bound state in the @xmath62 system , but does not require it .",
    "future experimental studies of this state are interesting@xcite and should provide lots of new information about properties of qcd bound states .        for a review of properties of x(3872 ) , see e.  s.  swanson , phys .",
