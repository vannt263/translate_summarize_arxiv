    "in 1988 , kaplan and manohar  @xcite showed that information about the contribution of sea quarks to ground state nucleon properties , such as spin , charge and magnetic moments , could be learned using neutral weak probes of the nucleon such as neutrino - nucleon scattering . soon after ,",
    "mckeown  @xcite and beck  @xcite outlined a possible program of experiments in parity - violating electron scattering that , when combined with existing measurements of nucleon electromagnetic form factors , would allow the identification of possible strange quark contributions to the proton s charge and magnetism .",
    "experiments were proposed at the mit - bates laboratory , jefferson lab , and the mainz microtron to accomplish this goal . in the decade or so",
    "since , many theoretical models of the strange quark components of these neutral weak matrix elements , have appeared in the literature , and the first quantitative information from experiments is becoming available . here",
    "i will provide a summary of the recent measurements , along with expected progress in the short term .    while the expectation is that strange quark contributions should be small",
    ", they occupy a special place in nucleon structure because their presence would be exclusively in the nucleon s @xmath2 sea .",
    "evidence to date suggests that they have a sizeable contribution to the nucleon s unpolarized quark momentum distribution in the nucleon  @xcite , as well as to the nucleon s mass  @xcite , although the latter has some degree of uncertainty due to both experimental and theoretical extrapolations required to obtain the result .",
    "a decade of precise spin - dependent deep - inelastic scattering experiments has led to the conclusion that strange quarks contribute significantly to the ( small ) fraction of the proton s spin carried by quark spins  @xcite , although again assumptions about su(3 ) symmetry are required in order to extract a result .",
    "parity - violating electron scattering is primarily sensitive to the matrix element @xmath3 , which provides information about the @xmath4 contributions to the nucleon s charge and magnetization distributions .",
    "the neutral weak nucleon current as probed through pv @xmath0-@xmath1 scattering is @xmath5 u \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath6 are the neutral weak equivalents of the nucleon s dirac and pauli form factors @xmath7 . at low momentum transfer , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are more often expressed as the sachs form factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which can be directly related to the nucleon s charge and magnetization distributions , respectively , and which have the normalizations @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "corresponding definitions can be made for the vector weak form factors @xmath6 . because the nw form factors are derived from the same matrix element @xmath16 as their em counterparts",
    ", they can be re - expressed in terms of the measured em form factors , with an explicit remainder coming from strange quarks , assuming only that neutrons and protons differ by an interchange of @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks . @xmath19",
    "the @xmath20 thus provide a third degree of freedom to disentangle the flavor structure of the proton s charge and magnetism .",
    "the radiative corrections @xmath21 represent contributions from higher order processes and have been computed  @xcite to be @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the axial form factor @xmath24 is related to the same matrix element as that defining the nucleon s spin , @xmath25 , and its isoscalar component explicitly contains the @xmath26-quark contribution , @xmath27 .",
    "its isovector @xmath28 component , to which pv @xmath0-@xmath29 scattering is primarily sensitive , can be expressed in terms of the neutron @xmath30-decay constant @xmath31 , but also contains higher order corrections that can come from , for example , an electromagnetic @xmath0-@xmath29 interaction coupled with a weak exchange between quarks , or from @xmath32-@xmath33 box diagrams .",
    "the effective axial form factor is @xmath34 where @xmath35=+(@xmath36)1 for protons(neutrons ) , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are due to the higher order terms .",
    "experimentally , parity - violating @xmath0-@xmath29 scattering results in an asymmetry in the detected yield for a longitudinally polarized beam on an unpolarized target : @xmath39}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 are kinematic factors and the @xmath32 index refers to nucleon em form factors .",
    "a single measurement typically involves at least two of the above terms , so a complete separation of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 involves at least three experiments .",
    "quasielastic scattering from deuterium can be used to constrain @xmath46 since it carries similar sensitivity to the axial term but is relatively insensitive to the strange vector form factors .",
    "a program of experiments has been carried out at mit - bates and jefferson laboratories and new experiments are underway at jlab and also at the mainz microtron .    on the theoretical front",
    ", a wide variety of models have been used to estimate the magnitude of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , including a few predictions for their behavior with @xmath49 . at @xmath49=0 , @xmath47",
    "is constrained to be 0 since the proton has no net strangeness , but @xmath48 is not so constrained and is defined through the expression @xmath50 the low energy behavior of each is characterized by a radius parameter that can be written in a dimensionless form as @xmath51 .",
    "the wide variety of predictions precludes extensive discussion here , but reviews can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : models ] shows a sampling of many of the models : a notable feature is that while many predict @xmath52 to be @xmath53 , predictions for the electric strangeness @xmath54 vary widely and do not even agree on the sign .",
    "it is of interest to note one recent calculation  @xcite , where @xmath48 and @xmath55 were analyzed within the framework of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it was first thought that the slope of @xmath48 could be determined analytically , and with constraints coming from the first results from sample and happex , limits on the @xmath49 behavior could be predicted  @xcite , which resulted in opposite signs for the two form factors .",
    "it was , however , recently shown in  @xcite that the slope of @xmath48 is sensitive to an unknown low energy constant that enters at @xmath56 due cancellations at lower order , so both the magnitude and sign of @xmath48 at low @xmath49 are still unconstrained by theory .     and the electric strangeness radius parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the horizontal axis refers to a particular calculation : see   for a recent summary . for scale , the equivalent radius parameter for the neutron s charge form factor is also shown.,width=288 ]    [ fig : models ]",
    "in the sample experiment  @xcite , pv electron scattering was measured in the backward direction , from both hydrogen and deuterium targets , in order to determine @xmath48 and @xmath46 at @xmath57  ( gev / c)@xmath58 .",
    "a 200  mev , 40  @xmath59a polarized beam was scattered from a 40  cm liquid hydrogen target .",
    "cerenkov light from scattered electrons was detected in an array of ten mirror - phototube pairs arranged symmetrically about the beam axis covering angles between 130@xmath60 and 170@xmath60 .",
    "the scattered electron rate was integrated over the 25  @xmath59sec beam pulse and sorted by beam helicity state , which was flipped pseudo - randomly at 600  hz .",
    "results from the 200  mev running were published in  @xcite and  @xcite , where the latter included data from quasielastic scattering from deuterium .",
    "it was found that while @xmath48 is likely small , there was an approximately 1.5@xmath61 discrepancy between the extracted value of @xmath46 and that expected assuming a value for the weak radiative corrections as computed by zhu  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "this led to theoretical investigations of the nuclear contributions in the deuterium data as well as a more detailed look at the extraction of @xmath46 from the data .    in a simple static approximation ,",
    "the pv asymmetry in deuterium is an incoherent sum of that of the neutron and proton , and the contributions from @xmath48 largely cancel , and the sensitivity to @xmath46 is approximately the same as for a proton target .",
    "nuclear corrections can potentially modify the asymmetry , both through parity - conserving  @xcite , and parity - violating  @xcite two - body effects . at the sample kinematics the pc terms",
    "modify the asymmetry by 1 - 3% , and the pv terms are negligible .",
    "the sample apparatus also has contributions from threshold breakup and elastic @xmath0-@xmath18 scattering which modify the asymmetry by a few percent .",
    "an improved analysis of the sample deuterium data now brings the extracted value of @xmath46 into reasonable agreement with  @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : sample ] , but has a relatively small impact on @xmath48 .",
    "the new results include a complete geant model of the detector , a revision to the electromagnetic radiative corrections and a dilution correction for coherent @xmath62 production in the experimental yield which was previously neglected .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of  @xcite was used to model the physics asymmetry .",
    "these combined theoretical and experimental efforts lead to better confidence that the higher order contributions to @xmath45 are now under control .",
    "results from the third sample measurement , at lower momentum transfer , also agree with expectations from theory  @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen results were also revised  @xcite , resulting an experimental asymmetry of , after all dilution corrections , @xmath63  ppm . combining this result with the theoretical value of @xmath45 results  @xcite results in the more upright ellipse in figure  [ fig : sample ] .",
    "while this result is consistent with little or no strange quark effects , it suggests a positive value for @xmath48 whereas most calculations predict a @xmath64 value near @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : sample ]",
    "the first measurements of parity - violating electron scattering at jefferson laboratory  @xcite were carried out by the happex collaboration , who used a 3.3  gev polarized beam on a 15  cm hydrogen target and detected the scattered electrons using the pair of high resolution spectrometers ( hrs ) in hall a at 12.5@xmath60 .",
    "the measured asymmetry , at @xmath49=0.48  ( gev / c)@xmath58 , is sensitive to the combination @xmath66 .",
    "the counting rate of approximately 1  mhz per spectrometer required the use of integrating techniques , and a set of pb - scintillator total absorption counters was used instead of the standard tracking detector package .",
    "the happex experiment was the first to use a strained gaas crystal in the polarized electron source , which produces beam polarization in excess of 70% .",
    "such sources can have an analyzing power for linear polarization in the incident laser light that could potentially result in significant helicity correlated position differences of the beam on the experimental target .",
    "such effects were , however , kept to a negligible level by insertion of a rotatable half - wave plate in the laser beam and with a feedback system nulling any helicity - correlated intensity asymmetry .",
    "the experimentally determined asymmetry from the happex experiment is @xmath67  ppm , corresponding to @xmath68 where the latter uncertainty is due to knowledge of the nucleon em form factors .",
    "happex thus for the most part precludes the parameter space in which @xmath47 and @xmath48 have the same sign .",
    "the future program for happex includes a forward angle measurement at @xmath49=0.1 ( gev / c)@xmath58 on hydrogen  @xcite , as well as the first measurement of the pv asymmetry in elastic electron scattering from helium  @xcite . due to the fact that @xmath69he is a spin-0 , isospin-0 , target , only a single weak form factor exists and",
    "it can be directly related to @xmath47 with a good model of the @xmath69he nucleus .",
    "theoretical expectations are that contributions to the asymmetry from many - body effects in the helium are negligible  @xcite at low momentum transfer .",
    "the combined measurements , or the new hydrogen measurement combined with the sample result , will result in a determination of @xmath47 .",
    "the pva4 collaboration at mainz has taken a different experimental approach , with a detector with sufficient segmentation and specialized electronics that counting the scattered particles is feasible despite high rates .",
    "a 20  @xmath59a beam of polarized electrons was incident on a 10  cm target .",
    "scattered electrons are detected at 35@xmath60 with a pbf@xmath70 erenkov shower calorimeter .",
    "the detector design includes 1022 pbf@xmath70 crystals arranged in 7 rings , and processed in 3x3 modules with self - triggering and histogramming electronics : for the first two measurements approximately half of the detector was instrumented .",
    "the energy resolution of the detectors must be sufficient to separate the 10  mhz of elastically scattered electrons from the 90  mhz of inelastic electrons coming from threshold pion and resonance production .",
    "the achieved energy resolution was 4%/@xmath71  @xcite .",
    "the first pva4 measurement was at a beam energy of 855  mev , corresponding to @xmath49=0.23  ( gev / c)@xmath58 and a sensitivity to the combination @xmath72 .",
    "the experimental asymmetry after all dilution corrections is @xmath73  ppm , corresponding to an approximately 1@xmath61 deviation of the asymmetry from that expected with no strange quarks , but again hinting that @xmath47 and @xmath48 are either both small or have opposite sign .",
    "additional data have already been taken , the run concluding in june 2003 , at 570  mev beam energy , corresponding to @xmath49=0.1  ( gev / c)@xmath58 . again by combining these data with the results from sample will allow the first experimental limits on @xmath47 .",
    "future plans involve reversing the detector for backward angle measurements at @xmath49=0.23 and 0.48  ( gev / c)@xmath58 to combine with the existing happex and pva4 data .",
    "although the kinematic sensitivities of each of the experiments is somewhat different , the results from each of the three above @xmath0-@xmath29 measurements can be shown , as in figure  [ fig : asym - dev ] , as a deviation from the asymmetry expected with no strange quarks . while any single measurement is consistent with little or no strange quark contribution , the trend in all three experiments suggests an @xmath26-quark contribution that is slightly positive .",
    "it should be noted that , in addition to the parity - violation results , both the pva4 and sample experiments have measured a `` beam spin asymmetry '' resulting from scattering from a purely transversely polarized beam  @xcite .",
    "to lowest order , the asymmetry , which results in a variation of the cross section in azimuthal angle with respect to the beam axis , is to lowest order the result of two - photon processes .",
    "such processes have recently become of interest because they may help explain the discrepancy in the determination of the proton charge form factor at high momentum transfer from polarization and cross section data  @xcite , and they are related to the virtual compton scattering process which provide information about nucleon polarizabilities  @xcite .",
    "-@xmath29 scattering , shown as the fractional deviation of the measurement from the asymmetry expected if @xmath48=@xmath47=0 at all momentum transfers .",
    "overlaid are the expected uncertainties coming from the first phase of the g0 experiment , scheduled to run in early 2004.,height=288 ]    [ fig : asym - dev ]",
    "the g0 experiment at jlab is a dedicated to determining @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath45 from a single experimental apparatus over a broad @xmath49 range .",
    "the detector consists of a superconducting toroidal spectrometer with an array of scintillators along the focal plane to determine the pv asymmetry at both forward and backward scattered electron angles .",
    "polarized electrons are scattered from a 20  cm liquid hydrogen target . in the forward configuration",
    ", the recoil protons are detected and sorted by @xmath49 covering the range @xmath74  ( gev / c)@xmath58 . in the backward configuration the apparatus is reversed and electrons scattered at 108@xmath60 will be detected with three dedicated magnet settings corresponding to @xmath49 = 0.25 , 0.5 and 0.8  ( gev / c)@xmath58 . in the forward mode ,",
    "the protons are identified and separated from pions via time - of - flight from the target to detector , which is about 20  ns . in the backward mode",
    "the detector package requires an augmentation with another array of scintillators ( cryostat exit detectors ) and aerogel erenkov counters to eliminate negative pions from the trigger .",
    "data will also be acquired with a deuterium target to experimentally determine the @xmath49-dependence of @xmath45 .",
    "the first engineering run of the experiment , in its forward mode , was carried out in late 2002 during which a few days of asymmetry data were collected . while the statistical uncertainties are too large to draw physics conclusions from these data , the measured asymmetry of approximately 5  ppm is consistent with expectation , has a reasonable @xmath49 behavior , and reverses appropriately with manual reversal of the sign of the beam polarization .",
    "after a second engineering run , the g0 collaboration will carry out its forward mode physics measurement .",
    "while a definitive determination of the relative signs and/or magnitude of @xmath48 and @xmath47 will require the backward angle measurements as well , this first set of data will both extend the kinematic reach and improve the precision of the data shown in figure  [ fig : asym - dev ] .",
    "additional details of the g0 experiment can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "improvements in polarized beam technology in the last decade have made precise measurements of parity - violating electron scattering possible , and the next generation of experiments , which move beyond studies of hadron structure to other physics are now being considered .",
    "one direction is to use parity - violating electron scattering as a precise probe of neutron distributions in heavy nuclei  @xcite , which may have relevance in understanding the structure of neutron stars .",
    "another direction is to carry out precision tests of the standard model at relatively low momentum transfer where sensitivity to additional @xmath33-bosons , for example , is greatly enhanced .",
    "the latter is of particular interest in light of the recent results from the nutev collaboration in which a 3@xmath61 deviation from expectation in @xmath75 was measured  @xcite .",
    "the latter direction is being pursued by the qweak collaboration at jlab , and further details can be found in  @xcite in these proceedings .",
    "since the earliest measurements of parity - violating electron scattering at slac  @xcite in which the weak mixing angle was first measured , the basic techniques of parity - violating electron scattering have remained more or less the same .",
    "but the achievable precision has greatly improved as a result of new high intensity electron beams , advances in polarized beam technology , and technical advances in the feedback and laser systems that are needed for polarized beam delivery .",
    "new physics directions also emerged and the results are beginning to become available from the first experiments to use pv electron scattering as a probe of hadron structure .",
    "we can look forward to more new results in the near future with the next phases of happex and pva4 and the first results from the g0 experiment , all of which should further our understanding of the role of sea quarks in the nucleon s ground state structure .      9 d.  kaplan and a.v .",
