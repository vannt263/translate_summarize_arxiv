    "we are entering the era of precision stellar astrophysics .",
    "large surveys are yielding data with unprecedented quality and quantity , and even more ambitious programs are on the near horizon .",
    "this advance is not merely a matter of much larger samples of measurements than were possible before ; there are also fundamentally new observables arising from the advent of asteroseismology as a practical stellar population tool .",
    "these new observables are particularly powerful diagnostics when complemented with data from more traditional approaches . in this paper",
    "we present the first release of the joint apokasc asteroseismic and spectroscopic survey for targets with both high - resolution apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) spectra analyzed by members of the third sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) and asteroseismic data obtained by the _",
    "kepler _ mission and analyzed by members of the _ kepler _ asteroseismology science consortium ( kasc ) . when completed we anticipate of order 8,000 red giants and 600 dwarfs and subgiants with asteroseismic data and high - resolution spectra . in this initial paper",
    "we catalog the properties of 1916 red giants observed as part of the sloan digital sky survey data release 10 @xcite",
    ". a catalog for the less - evolved stars will be presented in a separate publication ( serenelli et al .",
    "2014 , in prep . )",
    "large spectroscopic surveys in the milky way galaxy are now a reality , and a variety of sampling strategies and resolutions have been employed .",
    "low- to medium - resolution surveys such as segue @xcite , rave @xcite , and lamost @xcite provide stellar properties for large samples of stars .",
    "high - resolution programs are complementary , with more detailed abundance mixtures and more precise measurements for still - substantial samples .",
    "galah @xcite and gaia - eso @xcite are optical surveys ; apogee @xcite is instead focusing on the infrared .",
    "infrared spectroscopy is attractive for milky way studies because it is less sensitive to extinction ; it also has different systematic error sources than traditional optical spectroscopy ( garca prez 2014 , in prep . )",
    "these surveys permit detailed stellar population reconstructions using chemical tagging , kinematic data , effective temperature , and surface gravities ; see for example , @xcite for segue , @xcite for gaia - eso , or @xcite for rave .",
    "spectroscopic properties can be complemented by photometric parameter estimation , and the gaia mission @xcite should add critical measurements of distances and proper motions .",
    "standing alone , however , there are intrinsic limitations in the information from spectroscopic studies of stellar populations .",
    "the fundamental stellar properties of mass and age are only indirectly inferred from spectra . in the case of red giants , their hr diagram position yields relatively weak constraints on either mass or age .",
    "chemical tagging _ - _ for example , using high [ @xmath4/fe ] as a marker of old populations @xcite _ - _ is a valuable method , but the absolute time scale is uncertain @xcite and the chemical evolution rates in different systems need not have been the same . large surveys also require automated pipeline estimation of stellar parameters , and it can be difficult to calibrate these pipelines .",
    "these issue reflect the underlying problem that the dependence of absorption line strength on stellar atmosphere properties is not completely understood .",
    "this is in part due to incomplete and inaccurate atomic data , but there are also important physical effects that are challenging to model .",
    "traditional atmosphere analysis uses one - dimensional plane - parallel atmospheres , treats line broading with an ad hoc microturbulence , and assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "spherical effects , more realistic turbulence modeling from three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , and departures from lte can strongly impact the interpretation of the spectrum ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the difficulty of modeling the outermost layers , where real atmospheres transition to a chromosphere , can also play a role in complicating spectroscopic inferences .",
    "therefore , stellar parameter determinations for large samples require calibration against standards whose properties are known by other means , or whose membership in a cluster demands that they have similar composition .",
    "independently , there have been exciting advances in asteroseismology driven largely by data from space missions . in an important breakthrough , the corot @xcite and _ kepler _",
    "@xcite missions have discovered that virtually all red giants are non - radial oscillators .",
    "red giant asteroseismology is revolutionizing our understanding of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "global properties of the oscillations , such as the large frequency spacing @xmath5 and frequency of maximum oscillation power @xmath6 , are naturally related to the stellar mean density and surface gravity , respectively @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "basic pulsation data , combined with measured effective temperatures , permit estimation of stellar masses and radii in a domain where these crucial stellar properties have been notoriously uncertain .",
    "access to large numbers of stellar mass measurements has profound implications for stellar population studies @xcite .",
    "seismology also yields completely new observables for red giants because of a fortunate coincidence : their physical structure permits coupling between waves that propagate primarily in the core and those which propagate primarily in the envelope .",
    "the net result is oscillations of mixed character which carry information about the structure of both the core and envelope .",
    "we can therefore use the detailed pattern of observed oscillation frequencies to distinguish between first - ascent giants ( with h - shell burning only ) and red clump stars ( with he - core and h - shell burning ) @xcite .",
    "asymptotic red giant stars , with two shell sources , would appear with a pattern similar , but not identical , to first - ascent giants ; however , most work to date has focused on lower luminosities where such stars are not expected to be found . rapid rotation in the cores of red giants has been discovered ( @xcite ) .",
    "time - series data from _ kepler _ can also measure the surface rotation rates of stars through starspot modulation of their light curves @xcite .",
    "mapping the angular momentum evolution of giants as a function of mass is another new frontier with rich astrophysical rewards .",
    "asteroseismology alone , however , has important limitations on the information that it can provide .",
    "effective temperatures are required to infer mass and radius separately , and stellar ages depend on both mass and composition .",
    "for example , it was possible to use the kepler input catalog ( kic ) data of @xcite to define a sequence of solar - mass asteroseismic targets from the main sequence to the giant branch , but abundances are essential for finding true solar analogs @xcite . in the corot fields",
    "@xcite were able to infer mean stellar mass differences between populations along different sightlines , but interpreting these measurements in terms of age would require spectroscopic data on metallicity and the mixture of heavy elements .",
    "the scarcity of abundance data for stars in the _ kepler _ field is therefore a major limitation ; the sheer volume of data ( roughly 21,000 red giants ) has made traditional spectroscopic studies infeasible .",
    "fortunately , there is a new spectroscopic survey ideally suited for large samples of red giants .",
    "the multi - fiber , high - resolution h - band spectrograph from apogee on the sdss 2.5 m telescope @xcite , is ideally suited to observing _",
    "targets because it is well matched to the target density of the fields observed by the mission with 230 science fibers available over a 7 square degree field .",
    "the @xmath7 spectra were designed to produce temperatures , [ fe / h ] and [ x / fe ] with accuracies of @xmath8 , 0.1 dex , and 0.1 dex respectively @xcite .",
    "actual performance , as reported by @xcite , is close to these goals .",
    "there is no other spectroscopic sample of this size and quality available for _ kepler _ red giants .",
    ", which corresponds to the metallicity [ fe / h ] ( see section 3.1 . ) future apogee data releases will provide abundance measurements of 15 elements , including o , mg , and fe . ]    here we report the first apokasc data release , which includes red giants whose spectra were released in the sdss - iii date release 10 ( dr10 ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we describe our sample selection in section 2 .",
    "our spectroscopic data calibration is described and compared with photometric temperatures and asteroseismic surface gravities in section 3 .",
    "the asteroseismic analysis is discussed in section 4 .",
    "we present the catalog and compare it to the kic in section 5 .",
    "a look ahead to the full catalog and a discussion is presented in section 6 .",
    "our goal is to obtain data for a combined asteroseismic and spectroscopic sample of a large number of astrophysically interesting targets in the _ kepler _ fields . understanding the selection effects in our sample is important for interpreting our results .",
    "selection effects in our sample enter at several distinct levels : the match between the oscillation frequencies and the time sampling , the selection of which stars to study for oscillations , and the selection of targets for spectroscopic observation .",
    "the oscillation frequencies span a broad range , from five minutes for the sun to tens of days for luminous giants .",
    "a single observing strategy will therefore not work across the entire domain .",
    "fortunately , _ kepler _ has two observing modes : one minute ( short - cadence ) and thirty minute ( long - cadence ) .",
    "long - cadence targets are typically observed in 90 day cycles , hereafter referred to as quarters .",
    "the short - cadence mode is ideal for asteroseismic studies of dwarfs and subgiants ; however , there are a limited number of such targets that _ kepler _ was able to observe .",
    "@xcite detected oscillations in @xmath9 600 of the @xmath9 2,000 targets observed in short - cadence mode for at least 30 days .",
    "the long - cadence mode is ideal for measuring oscillations in red giants , and a large number were observed for at least one quarter by the satellite .",
    "more than 70% of the long - cadence red giants were detected as solar - like oscillators even with the first three months of data @xcite , with the non - detections primarily in luminous stars requiring a longer time sequence .",
    "furthermore , the most precise measurements derived from ir spectra are those for cool and evolved stars , so there is a natural pairing between apogee spectra and asteroseismology of red giants .",
    "the bulk of our sample is therefore composed of red giants , with smaller , separate designated dwarf and subgiant cohorts , and the duration of the mission and time sampling should not introduce signficant biases in our sample .    however , there are more bright red giants in the _ kepler _ fields than were observed in long - cadence mode , and there are more long - cadence targets than the number for which it was practical to obtain spectra .",
    "there are therefore two distinct selection criteria important for this sample : the criteria for being observed by _",
    "kepler _ and the criteria for being observed spectroscopically by apogee .",
    "furthermore , the initial dr10 sample is a subset of the overall apokasc sample , and the properties of these fields need not be representative for the sample as a whole .",
    "we therefore begin with a summary of the _ kepler _ short and long - cadence target selection procedures .",
    "we then describe how we used preliminary asteroseismic data to identify populations for spectroscopic observation .",
    "we then discuss special populations which we targeted for observing , describe our main sample grid , and how we filled the remaining fibers for the campaign .",
    "we end with a brief discussion of the properties of the first dataset being released in this paper .",
    "we included 400 of the asteroseismically - detected subgiants and dwarfs reported in @xcite from short - cadence observations .",
    "this sample is smaller than that of @xcite because hotter dwarfs did not fit our global criteria for apogee observations .",
    "the selection process of targets from the long - cadence sample is more complex than that for the short - cadence sample .",
    "the kepler mission was designed to search for transits of host stars by extrasolar planets , with a focus on solar analogs .",
    "however , giants are much more numerous than dwarfs in a sample with the _ kepler _ magnitude limit , which was designed for stars brighter than kepler magnitude _ @xmath10 _ = 16 .",
    "the kepler input catalog ( kic ; @xcite ) was therefore constructed to separate dwarfs and giants and to define the planet candidate target list .",
    "there were multiple criteria used to select giants for long - cadence observations .",
    "for our purposes there are two important samples : the kasc giants , defined below , and the full sample ( hereafter referred to as the public giants ) .",
    "a pre - launch list of 1,006 targets was chosen using only information available from the kic , and with the express purpose of providing a uniformly spaced set of stars over the focal plane serving as low proper motion , small parallax , astrometric controls .",
    "as such they were selected on the basis of a metric that was a combination of : ( a ) large distance , ( b ) bright , but not expected to saturate the detector to allow precise centroiding , ( c ) uncrowded  also to support precise centroiding , and ( d ) spread over the focal plane to give 11 to 12 red giant controls for each of _ kepler s _ 84 channels .",
    "there was also a sample of @xmath9 800 giants for asteroseismic monitoring that was assembled from pre - launch proposals submitted by kasc working groups .",
    "the initial red giant asteroseimology results were based on the combination of these two datasets ; hereafter we refer to these targets as the kasc giants .",
    "@xcite described how the basic seismic parameters were measured ; @xcite provided the stellar parameters , such as mass and radius ; and @xcite compared different analysis techniques .",
    "however , the derived stellar parameters did not include high - resolution spectroscopic metallicities and effective temperature estimates independent of the kic , which apogee can now provide .    characterizing",
    "the full public red giant sample is surprisingly challenging .",
    "the target list varied from observing quarter to quarter , as the giants candidates were deprioritized relative to the dwarfs for planet searches . using data from the first sixteen quarters in the q1-q16 star properties catalog ,",
    "@xcite combined the kic and published literature information to obtain a total of 21,427 stars with @xmath1 @xmath11 and @xmath12 that were observed for at least one quarter during the _ kepler _ mission .",
    "this sample does not include stars observed during commissioning ( q0 ) only .",
    "the majority of the @xcite sample , of order 15,000 red giants , were selected as planet search candidates using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "a total of 5282 red giants brighter than _ @xmath10 _ = 14 were included in the highest priority planet search cohort of 150,000 stars .",
    "the remaining red giants were selected from a much larger secondary target list of 57,010 giants , including a large number ( 11,057 ) brighter than _ @xmath10 _ = 14 . in practice this criterion favored brighter targets that were classifed as smaller red giants ; this is roughly equivalent to a sample with magnitude and surface gravity cuts .",
    "the mission also supplemented the target list with a cohort of 12,000 brighter targets , including stars without kic classification ; @xmath9 3,300 of these unclassfied stars proved to be cool or luminous giants @xcite .",
    "approximately 1,000 giant targets were also added in the go program , including @xmath9 300 that were observed in quarters 14 - 16 as part of a dedicated apokasc go proposal @xmath13 as described below .",
    "there are also an unknown number of stars classified as dwarfs in the kic that could be giants , and vice versa .",
    "an asteroseismic luminosity classification of all cool dwarfs is planned and should yield a complete census of giant stars in 2014 .      observing the entire _ kepler _",
    "red giant sample with apogee was not feasible , so apokasc had to develop an independent spectroscopic target selection process .",
    "there are high - priority categories of targets where we attempted to be as complete as possible _ - _ for example , rare but astrophysically interesting metal - poor stars or open cluster members .",
    "we also wanted uniform spectroscopic data for the stars with the highest quality _ kepler _ light curves , as these could serve as precise calibrators for stellar population and asteroseismic studies .",
    "another survey goal was to extend the range of surface gravity and metallicity relative to prior spectroscopic studies .",
    "finally , ages can be inferred from masses for first - ascent red giants , so it was important to have estimates of evolutionary state to preferentially target such stars over the more common core - he burning stars where mass loss complicates the mapping from mass to age .    our procedures for creating the final target list is described below . for a further discussion of apogee and apokasc targeting , see @xcite .",
    "for all targets we adopted limits on the magnitude ( @xmath14 ) and effective temperature ( @xmath15 k ) that were necessary for apogee , and we required that the targets fit within the apogee field of view .",
    "the magnitude limits guarded against overexposure and ensured a high signal - to - noise ratio in 1 hour observations ; the temperature cut was designed to avoid hot stars with uninformative ir spectra .",
    "we performed a uniform analysis of the _ kepler _ light curves to check for evolutionary diagnostics , rotation , or unusual asteroseismic properties .",
    "we added in external information for interesting populations .",
    "we then defined a reference set of red giants and red clump stars sampling a wide range of surface gravities , prioritizing stars with more complete time coverage .",
    "these datasets left us with free fibers that we could fill from the remainder of the available giant sample .",
    "we employed asteroseismic diagnostics for the full _ kepler _ red giant sample observed in long - cadence mode to infer their evolutionary state and to identify stars with unusual pulsational properties .",
    "we discuss the methods used for extracting the basic asteroseismic observables for the catalog in section 4 .",
    "our automated methodology for evolutionary state classification is described in @xcite and summarized here .",
    "the key tasks are identifying the frequencies of the dipole ( angular degree @xmath16 ) oscillation modes and inferring whether the pattern is characteristic of a core he - burning star or one with a degenerate and inert he core . to obtain the frequencies we detrended the time series from the public q1 to q8 data by removing discontinuities and applying a high - pass filter .",
    "the syd pipeline @xcite was used to derive the large frequency separation , and we implemented a simple peak bagging approach using different degrees of smoothing to identify all significant peaks in the power spectra .",
    "we associate a degree @xmath17 to each extracted frequency based on a method similar to that provided by @xcite . for the purpose of measuring period spacings of the dipole modes , which is important for this classification step ,",
    "we remove the radial and quadrupole modes .",
    "we only kept stars for which we detected at least five @xmath16 modes in order to obtain a more robust result in the following step .",
    "there are more than 8,000 stars that pass this criterion . for each star",
    "we measure the pairwise period spacing , @xmath18 , between successive peaks , and take the median of @xmath18 as the representative period spacing ( the median proved to be the most robust quantity compared to a simple mean or the moment ) .",
    "this method produced our best diagnostic of evolutionary state .",
    "we complemented this approach with a double - check using the methodology of @xcite .",
    "a subset of our targets ( 3128 ) could be unambiguously assigned to either the red clump or the first - ascent red giant branch .",
    "limited frequency resolution and other backgrounds , such as rotation , made automated classification ambiguous for the remainder of the sample .",
    "this evolutionary state information was used only for target selection purposes , as our procedure was not designed to provide complete information for the entire sample .",
    "we began our program by defining the highest - priority targets .",
    "the kasc giants described above are the best studied stars with the highest quality datasets , so we ensured that all of them would be included as targets . all subgiants and dwarfs from @xcite with kic @xmath19 and asteroseismic",
    "detections were targeted . known members of the open clusters ngc 6811 , 6819 , and 6791 bright enough for apogee and with asteroseismic detections",
    "were also all included @xcite .",
    "we also developed criteria to preferentially select metal - poor giants , rapid rotators , and luminous giants for spectroscopic observation .",
    "observing oscillations in metal - poor giants is critical for both stellar physics ( e.g. , scaling relations as a function of metallicity ; see @xcite ) and stellar populations questions , such as the age of the halo .",
    "a simulation of the stellar populations in the _ kepler _ fields with the trilegal code @xcite indicated that only 0.6% of giants are expected to have @xmath20 < -2.0 $ ] , for a predicted total of @xmath21 in the entire public giant database .",
    "efficient targeting of these stars is therefore essential , and we employed several methods to identify candidates .",
    "a total of 23 targets were selected by having kinematics consistent with the halo , defined here as follows : a proper motion greater than 0.01 arcsec @xmath22 and a transverse velocity greater than 200 km @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "an additional 41 targets were chosen from low - resolution spectra obtained by the sdss - iii collaboration for marvels target pre - selection in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "these spectra are similar to the spectra for the segue and segue2 surveys and were processed by the segue stellar parameter pipeline , which has been shown to measure [ fe / h ] with an uncertainty of 0.25 dex @xcite and to successfully identify even metal - poor giants @xcite , which are challenging to study at low resolution .",
    "finally , 67 metal - poor candidates were selected on the basis of washington photometry , which has the strongest metallicity sensitivity of any broadband system @xcite . in combination with ddo51",
    ", these filters can reliably identify metal - poor giants .",
    "we therefore selected a total of 128 candidates , of which 27 were new objects added to the _ kepler _ lc sample in apokasc go proposal @xmath13 ; there was some overlap in the lists of potential metal poor targets generated with the criteria above .",
    "the process for generating the metal - poor star candidate list and the yields from the various methods are described in harding et al .",
    "( 2014 , in prep ) .",
    "candidates in any of these three categories are referred to as `` halo '' in the targeting flags .",
    "rapidly rotating giants ( counted as `` rapid rotators '' in table 1 ) are relatively rare and may represent interesting stages of stellar evolution , such as recent mergers ; we therefore screened the long - cadence sample for signatures of rotational modulation .",
    "we found 162 targets with such a signature in the sample .",
    "intrinsically luminous giants ( defined here as stars with @xmath1 @xmath24 ) are under - represented in the public giant sample relative to the field population because they were specifically selected against in the _ kepelr _ planet transit survey design .",
    "these stars are important targets for both stellar population and stellar physics studies because they extend the dynamic range in gravity for testing both asteroseismic scaling relationships and the seismic properties of giants .",
    "more luminous giants in a magnitude - limited sample will be more distant from both earth and the galactic plane than less luminous ones , making the former more likely to be metal - poor . for our spectroscopic program we therefore selected all long - cadence targets with kic @xmath1 @xmath25 , including 43 m giants and 122 other giants .",
    "we also included all long - cadence giants with more than 8 quarters of data and @xmath1 between 1.6 and 2.2 , adding 175 additional targets .",
    "we also proposed new targets for long - cadence observations in a go program that had 4 quarters of data ( q14-q17 ) that were screened as likely high - luminosity targets which met our magnitude and temperature cuts for apogee observation , using kic properties as a basis .",
    "this dataset included all stars with kic @xmath1 between 0.1 and 1.1 and 20 stars randomly selected per 0.1 dex bin in @xmath1 between @xmath1 of 1.1 and 2 .",
    "this selection process added 253 new high - luminosity targets in total to the apogee sample .",
    "all candidates satisfying these criteria were counted as `` luminous giants '' in table 1 .      some stars , for poorly understood reasons ,",
    "have unusually low @xmath26 mode amplitudes ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a discussion ) , and spectroscopy of such targets is valuable .",
    "we included 37 such targets .",
    "there are 122 stars with good time coverage and unusually large @xmath18 , and 15 such targets with unusually small @xmath18 . included in our program",
    "are 90 stars whose @xmath18 values are intermediate between those expected for red clump and red giant branch stars , which is a possible signature of post - he flash stars @xcite .",
    "all of these targets were prioritized for spectroscopic observation .",
    "our initial target list included all of the stars in the special categories described above .",
    "we then defined a reference sample of stars with the highest possible quality of data : this included an accurate classification of evolutionary state and at most one quarter of data missing .",
    "we were left with 683 first - ascent giants ; they comprise the bulk of the sample .",
    "we randomly selected 150 red clump and 50 secondary clump stars from a larger pool ( 1684 ) of available candidates of comparable quality .",
    "we supplemented this list with a secondary priority set ( from the _ kepler _ go program ) of targets which otherwise fit our criteria but had less data available .",
    "this added 39 first - ascent giants , 58 stars with detected rotation or unusual pulsation properties , 105 secondary red clump , and 227 red clump stars .",
    "the remainder of the list was filled by public red giants ( with or without data on their evolutionary state ) and known red clump stars , identified as such by the diagnostics discussed in the previous section .",
    "the stars with ambigious evolutionary classification were divided into groups based on their asteroseismically - determined @xmath1 .",
    "public red giants with ambiguous evolutionary state measurements were considered possible red clump stars with @xmath27 and possible first - ascent red giant branch stars otherwise .",
    "we allocated 210 slots for red clump stars in 21 pointings .",
    "if there were fewer than 10 known red clump stars in a given target apogee pointing , the remainder was filled with possible red clump stars .",
    "we then selected all of the possible first - ascent red giant branch stars .",
    "these were prioritized first by the number of quarters observed and then randomized among stars with the same length of observations .",
    "then , public giants that appeared as asteroseismic outliers were prioritized by h - band magnitude .",
    "this was followed by the rest of the known red clump stars , prioritized by brightness .",
    "lastly , the public red giants identified as possible red clump stars were prioritized first by the number of quarters observed and then randomized among stars with the same length of observations .",
    "we illustrate the net effect of our sample selection in figure  [ fig : sample ] .    our final sample is described in table 1 .",
    "some stars are included in more than one category ( for example , luminous and halo ) ; and there are 1916 in total .",
    "`` gold '' refers to the targets used as calibrators for the spectroscopic surface gravity measurements in apogee .",
    "the full set of targeting flags are included in our main catalog table ( see section 5 ) . in this table",
    "we merge the two different labels of seismic interest and seismic outlier into one category , as both classes were targeted because of unusual features in their measursed pulsation properties .",
    "stars in the luminous giant category do not have direct targeting flags in subsequent tables , but can be identified by their kic surface gravity measurements . the targeting flags for each of the other categories are indicated in parens in the category column .",
    "there are two particularly important aspects of this sample worth noting .",
    "first , a diverse set of objects can be studied with this dataset ; second , the overall sample is far from being a simple representation of the underlying stellar population .",
    "basic statistics , such as the ratio of core he - burning to shell h - burning targets , are biased relative to the underlying populations .",
    "not all stars targeted as members of a class are true members . as a concrete example , only a portion of prospective halo giants satisfied our high - resolution abundance criteria .",
    "we therefore urge that care be employed when using our data for stellar population studies .",
    "the full dr12 sample is both more comprehensive and , arguably , less customized to individual projects ; we defer a full discussion of the impact on population studies to the release of the second dataset . for completeness , there are three other samples selected in this process and observed in apogee that will be released separately because they are either outside of the _ kepler _ fields or do not involve red giants .",
    "we observed all _ kepler _ objects of interest , or kois , that fit our magnitude and color cuts , all dwarfs within our magnitude range that had @xmath28 k , and selected targets observed by the corot satellite @xcite .",

    "the apogee stellar parameters and chemical abundances pipeline ( aspcap ) was employed to infer six atmospheric parameters from the observed spectra : effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) , metallicity ( [ m / h ] ) , surface gravity ( @xmath29 ) , carbon ( [ c / m ] ) , nitrogen ( [ n / m ] ) , and @xmath4 ( [ @xmath4/m ] ) abundance ratios .",

    "finally , the aspcap calibration procedure derived independent corrections to the three major spectroscopic parameters considered here . in principle , one could instead have imposed an external prior on one or more of them , and then searched for a refined spectroscopic solution .",
    "because we have precise asteroseismic surface gravities , we quantify here how our metallicities and temperatures would have been impacted if we had adopted them as a prior rather than independently calibrating all three .",
    "a detailed comparison of the full sample results with the kic and optical spectroscopy , which were not used to calibrate our measurements , is presented in section 5 .",
    "the aspcap spectroscopic effective temperatures were compared with photometric ones using calibrations by @xcite , hereafter ghb09 , using 2mass @xmath30 colors @xcite .",
    "@xcite found systematic differences in the range of 100 k to 200 k between the raw aspcap and those derived using the ghb09 scale and literature extinction estimates for star clusters .",
    "aspcap @xmath0 values were found to be consistent with literature values from optical spectroscopy , in mild tension with the photometric values .",
    "@xcite recommended calibrating the aspcap @xmath0 to conform with the photometric scale , because it is closer to the fundamental definition of the effective temperature than the spectroscopic studies ; however , the purely spectroscopic scale is defensible , and the difference between the two serves as a measure of plausible system zero - point shifts .",
    "the aspcap temperatures were corrected between 3500 k and 5500 k using an equation derived from the comparison with the ghb09 scale .",
    "the ghb09 calibration was chosen as a calibrator because it is explicitly designed for red giants .",
    "it is within @xmath31 k of the recent dwarf - only infrared flux method ( irfm ) temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "photometry provides precise relative temperatures for cluster members , and the rms differences between the aspcap and photometric temperatures for such stars were used by @xcite as a measure of random spectroscopic temperature uncertainties .",
    "random uncertainties ranged from @xmath32 k for metal - poor stars to @xmath21 k for metal - rich ones .",
    "the majority of the cluster stars used for the calibration are metal poor , while our sample has a mean metallicity close to solar .",
    "it is therefore possible that there could be metallicity trends in the temperature differences , a topic that we explore below when we compare photometric and spectroscopic temperatures in the _ kepler _ fields .",
    "the [ m / h ] dimension in aspcap was constructed by varying the solar - scaled abundances of all elements except c , n , and the @xmath4-capture elements o , mg , ca , si , ti . therefore , the best - fix [ m / h ] represents a line - weighted fit to the iron peak and light odd - z elements . in practice ,",
    "as discussed below , [ m / h ] correlates well with [ fe / h ] , and we will treat them as being functionally equivalent in this paper . the aspcap metallicity was compared with individual values from high - resolution observations from the literature , and with average cluster values .",
    "the derived metallicities from aspcap are close to literature values around solar metallicity .",
    "the difference in cluster averages between aspcap and literature becomes larger than 0.1 dex only below [ m / h ] @xmath33 , and this discrepancy increases with decreasing metallicity , reaching @xmath34 dex around [ m / h]@xmath35 and lower .",
    "an offset of comparable magnitude ( @xmath36 dex ) was found above [ m / h ] @xmath37 .",
    "@xcite therefore derived a calibration to bring the raw metallicities into agreement with the literature cluster averages .",
    "the metallicity uncertainty was derived from the standard deviation of individual cluster member metallicities around the cluster averages .",
    "this scatter can be as high as 0.14  dex for the lowest metallicity globular clusters , but it improves significantly ( similarly to @xmath0 ) for high metallicities .",
    "for open clusters around solar metallicity , the largest scatter is only 0.07  dex .",
    "we compare our metallicities with those derived from optical spectroscopy and from the kic in section 5 .",
    "surface gravities can be estimated from isochrones for red giants in star clusters if the distances , extinctions , and ages of the systems are known .",
    "@xcite found significant zero - point offsets between the raw spectroscopic values and those derived from cluster isochrones , motivating an empirical correction .",
    "the cluster - based surface gravity calibration was supplemented with a preliminary apokasc sample of asteroseismic gravities .",
    "the _ kepler _ targets are concentrated around solar metallicity , while the cluster sample is predominantly composed of metal - poor systems .",
    "we therefore adopted a hybrid empirical calibration that was solely a function of metallicity and solely based on the gold standard asteroseismic surface gravities for stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath38 .",
    "this gold standard sample had to be defined prior to the full analysis , and we briefly describe how this sample was assembled and analyzed below .",
    "the candidates were selected to be those with the most complete time coverage ; see @xcite for a discussion of the criteria .",
    "we then computed the mean asteroseismic parameters using the @xcite methodology .",
    "we adopted effective temperatures based on the _ griz _ sdss filters @xcite from @xcite , using the kic extinction map .",
    "grid modeling was performed using basti models and adopting the kic metallicities .",
    "we added 0.007 dex in quadrature to the formal uncertainties to account for systematic errors ; see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "a total of 286 stars from this list were observed in dr10 and used as calibrators ; see @xcite for a more complete discussion .",
    "we present the asteroseismic properties used for this calibrating sample in table 2 .",
    "we assess the validity of this approach using the full asteroseismic surface gravity from our data below .",
    "table 2 lists the surface gravities derived for the gold standard candidates .",
    "these were used to calibrate the aspcap spectroscopic surface gravities , and are included so that the results of @xcite can be replicated .",
    "the first column contains the kic i d .",
    "the second is the effective temperature inferred from sdss photometry in @xcite .",

    "we therefore conclude that our calibration based on the limited preliminary dataset yielded reasonable results on average for the full sample ( in the sense that the typical differences between our calibrators and spectroscopic values were similar to the same differences for stars not used as calibrators ) . however , there are interesting underlying trends in the differences between asteroseismic and spectroscopic @xmath1 , present in both the gold and full samples , which are illustrated as a function of @xmath1 and teff in figure  [ fig : deltagvsg ]",
    ".    we can obtain further insight into the origin of these differences by adding information on evolutionary state .",
    "when we do so , a clear division in mean difference emerges between core he - burning , or red clump , stars and first - ascent red giant branch stars ( see figure  [ fig : evstatecompare ] ) . some of these differences can be traced to the temperature and surface gravity trends illustrated above , but the differences persist even between members of the same star cluster .",
    "we are currently investigating the origin of the gravity offsets between red clump and red giant branch stars . small differential offsets",
    "( at the @xmath40 level ) between asteroseismic radius estimates for red clump and red giant branch stars were found in ngc 6791 @xcite and traced to differences in the sound crossing time at fixed large frequency spacing .",
    "however , the impact of the miglio corrections on the relative radii are too small to explain the observed surface gravity discrepancy , and the differential offset in surface gravity is likely to be at the 0.05 dex level or smaller because of correlations between asteroseismic masses and radii . an offset between the structures of model atmospheres in stars with similar hr diagram position but with different evolutionary states ( and thus differences in mass , helium , or cno )",
    "is in principle possible ; however , such effects are expected to be small .",
    "we conclude that this offset is an interesting clue that may shed light on both model atmospheres and asteroseismology , but that the mean values of the corrected asteroseismic and spectroscopic gravities are in good agreement .",
    "we can also check on the internal consistency of the spectroscopic temperature scale by comparing our spectroscopic effective temperatures with those that we would have derived using the kic extinction map and the ghb09 irfm color - temperature relationship employed in the global spectroscopic calibration .",
    "our results using the kic extinction map are compared with those in the zero - extinction limit in figure  [ fig : deltatkic ] .",
    "the dispersion is reasonable at @xmath41 k , but there is a significant zero - point offset of @xmath42 k in the former case .",
    "the bulk of the calibrating sample was in metal - poor globular cluster stars , so this feature could reflect a metallicity - dependent offset in the temperature scale ; the apokasc sample is predominantly close to solar abundance .",
    "another possibility is an error in the adopted extinction corrections ; as shown above , a zero - extinction case has an average offset of @xmath43 k. we view this as an unrealistic limit , but the difference between the two certainly highlights the need for an independent re - assessment of the kic extinction map .",
    "fortunately , a more extensive multi - wavelength dataset , especially at longer wavelengths , has been developed since the time the kic was constructed .",
    "@xcite used new stroemgren filter data in a stripe within the _ kepler _ fields , along with an extensive set of literature photometry , to derive systematically smaller extinction values than those in the kic . adopting their extinction map",
    "would imply a smaller ( but real ) temperature offset .",
    "@xcite used 2mass , irac , and wise data to infer extinctions when developing the apogee target list , using the rjce method @xcite ; work on a related approach for _ kepler _ targets is in progress . @xcite",
    "employ a related method of sed fitting and confirm a lower extinction estimate than that obtained from the kic alone . adopting the latter extinction values",
    "implies a @xmath0 difference of 74 k between the corrected aspcap and ghb irfm scale for solar abundance stars .",
    "finally , we have derived independent calibrations of temperature , metallicity , and surface gravity , applied after the aspcap parameter solution was obtained . an alternate method that has been successfully used for dwarfs in the _ kepler _ fields is to to search for the best solution adopting the asteroseismic surface gravity as a prior @xcite .",
    "this approach is similar in philosophy to using isochrone fits to surface gravities in star cluster dwarfs rather than searching for less precise spectroscopic values for warm dwarfs . as a test of adopting this approach , we used the aspcap pipeline for all parameters except surface gravity , for which we supplied the asteroseismic values .",
    "the chi - squared metric for the best fit was visibly degraded , as expected .",
    "however , the resulting metallicities and effective temperatures were also offset from the values obtained from our independent calibration checks .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure  [ fig : corr_fix ] where we compare the values that we would have obtained with an asteroseismic gravity prior with the actual calibrated values .",
    "the sense of the difference in temperature is expected from boltzmann - saha balance considerations , and the corrected values using this approach are actually in worse agreement than the raw ones when compared with independent measurements .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xcite approach of independent calibrations for each of the spectroscopic parameters is more accurate for our purposes than adopting an asteroseismic surface gravity prior .    in summary , our raw spectroscopic parameters",
    "have been derived using a homogeneous analysis method .",
    "comparisons with independent measurements motivated us to define modest correction terms for metallicity and effective temperature and more substantial ones for the spectroscopic surface gravities . at the metal - rich end",
    ", the spectroscopic surface gravities were tied to an asteroseismic reference scale using a limited sample of gold standard targets . with the full dr10 sample of spectroscopic and asteroseismic data we revisited the spectroscopic surface gravity calibration with a much larger sample of asteroseismic surface gravities .",
    "the larger asteroseismic sample is in good mean agreement with the @xcite calibration , but there are modest ( but real ) systematic offsets at the @xmath36 dex level between the asteroseismic and spectroscopic scales as functions of effective temperature , gravity , and evolutionary state .",
    "further work is needed to identify the origin of these effects ( in terms of systematics in either the asteroseismic or spectroscopic surface gravities ) .",
    "we also compared our spectroscopic effective temperatures for _ kepler _ field red giants against @xmath0 derived from the same photometric temperature calibration that was used in star clusters .",
    "there is also an offset of 193 k between the spectroscopic @xmath0 scale and the irfm photometric @xmath0 scale if the kic extinction map is adopted ; however , there is independent evidence that the kic extinctions are overestimated , so this result should be treated as an upper bound on systematic @xmath0 errors for our sample . with the extinction map of @xcite we can quantify the zero - point shift more precisely ( and it is at the 74 k level ) .",
    "if this offset is confirmed , it implies a metallicity - dependent temperature correction that was not captured in the original calibration .",
    "we view these temperature and gravity comparisons as fair indicators of potential systematic uncertainties in these properties .",
    "neither of these comparisons directly address the accuracy and precision of our metallicity estimates , which we discuss in section 5 when comparing our final catalog values with the kic and optical spectroscopy .",
    "our goal for the asteroseismic sample was to provide masses , radii , and surface gravities for all of our red giants .",
    "this is a complex task with multiple stages , and we discuss our methodology below ; we begin with a brief summary .    we processed and corrected the raw light curves to extract the oscillation frequencies .",
    "we then identified the modes , and distilled the information from the observed oscillation pattern down to two global asteroseismic parameters : the frequency of maximum power and the average large frequency spacing , whose interpretation is discussed below .",
    "these parameters , combined with the effective temperature , could in principle be used to solve for the asteroseismic masses and radii with the aid of scaling relations .",
    "we took the additional step of combining information from stellar models with the global asteroseismic parameters , and used this grid modeling effort to both identify outliers and to refine our estimates . in all cases we employed multiple methods and made an attempt to assess random and systematic uncertainties .",
    "we release asteroseismically determined stellar parameter estimates for two distinct spectroscopic inputs , corresponding to the raw and corrected scales discussed above .",
    "preparation of _ kepler _ long - cadence data @xcite for asteroseismic analysis was handled in three cohorts .",
    "we used pdc - sap ( pre - search data conditioning simple aperture photometry ) light cuves @xcite for a cohort of 2067 field stars .",
    "these data were prepared for asteroseismic analysis in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "_ kepler _ data for quarters q0 through q8 were used for these targets . a second cohort of 657 field stars had pixel - level data available from _ kepler _ observing quarters q0 through q12 inclusive .",
    "aperture photometry was performed on these data ( mathur , bloemen et al . in prep ) , producing light curves that were more stable at longer time scales than the pdc - map data .",
    "this improvement was at the expense of having slightly elevated high - frequency noise .",
    "finally , raw q0 through q11 data were prepared for 34 stars in the open cluster ngc6819 , again using the procedures described in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "a total of 581 stars had data available in both the pixel and the public sets described above ( a point we return to briefly at the end of section  [ sec : cat ] ) .",
    "in total , five data analysis methods - @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite - were used to extract independent estimates of two global asteroseismic parameters from the frequency - power spectrum of the lightcurves .",
    "some of the analysis methods were not applied to every dataset .",
    "one parameter was the average large frequency separation , @xmath44 , the mean spacing between consecutive overtones of the same angular degree , @xmath17 .",
    "the average large separation scales to very good approximation as @xmath45 , @xmath46 being the mean density of a star having mass @xmath47 and surface radius @xmath48 ( e.g. , see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . the dependence of @xmath44 on the mean stellar density may be used as a scaling relation normalized by solar properties and parameters , i.e. , @xmath49 the second global parameter is @xmath6 , the frequency of maximum oscillation power .",
    "it has been shown to scale to good approximation as @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the surface gravity and @xmath0 is the effective temperature of the star .",
    "the following scaling relation may therefore be adopted : @xmath52    the completeness of the results ( i.e. , the fraction of stars with returned estimates ) varied , since some pipelines are better suited to analysing different ranges in .",
    "we selected one data analysis method , oct@xcite , to provide the catalog global asteroseismic parameters of the stars in all three cohorts .",
    "this selection was based on the returned @xmath6 values .",
    "the hekker et al .",
    "method had the highest completeness fraction , and results that were consistent with those given by the other pipelines .",
    "this approach ensured we obtained a homogenous set of global asteroseismic parameters , which were then used to estimate the fundamental stellar properties ( see section  [ sec : griddling ] below ) .    for outlier rejection we selected a reference method for each cohort , this being the one whose @xmath6 estimates lay closest to the median over all stars in that cohort ( mosser et al .",
    "for the pixel and public cohorts ; and kallinger et al .",
    "for the cluster cohort ) . if the hekker et al .",
    "@xmath6 differed from the reference @xmath6 by more than 10% , we rejected the asteroseismic parameters for that star .",
    "this procedure removed 28 stars from the pixel cohort , 167 stars from the public cohort , and 1 star from the cluster cohort .",
    "uncertainties on the final @xmath44 and @xmath6 of each star were obtained by adding , in quadrature , the formal uncertainty returned by the hekker et al .",
    "method to the standard deviation of the values returned by all methods .",
    "we also allowed for known systematic errors in equation  [ eq : dnu ] ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite ) , by including an additional systematic contribution of 1.5% ( also added in quadrature ) . because @xmath44 is usually determined more precisely than @xmath6 , we also added the same systematic contribution to the @xmath6 uncertainties .",
    "this is essentially the approach adopted by @xcite in their analysis of asteroseismic _ kepler _ objects of interest .",
    "for each star we used the two global asteroseismic parameters , @xmath44 and @xmath6 , together with the estimates of effective temperature @xmath0 and metallicity [ fe / h ] , as input to `` grid - based '' estimation of the fundamental stellar properties .",
    "this approach matches the set of observables to theoretical sets calculated for each model in an evolutionary grid of tracks or isochrones .",
    "the fundamental properties of the models ( i.e. , @xmath48 , @xmath47 and @xmath0 ) were used as inputs to the scaling relations ( equations  [ eq : dnu ] and  [ eq : numax ] ) to calculate theoretical values of @xmath44 and @xmath6 for matching with the observations .",

    "the uncertainties in @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) were accounted for by increasing the uncertainties in the @xmath44 and @xmath6 data of each star , using simple error propagation .",
    "further details on grid modeling using asteroseismic data may be found in , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopted a grid - based analysis that coupled six pipeline codes to eleven model grids , comprising a selection of widely used sets of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones that have a range of commonly adopted input physics . in applying several grid - pipeline combinations ,",
    "we capture implicitly in our final results the impact of model dependencies from adopting different commonly - used grids , and differences in the detail of the pipeline codes themselves .",
    "grid - based estimates of the stellar properties were returned by the following pipeline codes :    * the yale - birmingham ( yb ) @xcite ; * the bellaterra stellar properties pipeline ( bespp ) ( @xcite extended for asteroseismic analysis ) ; * param @xcite ; * radius @xcite ; * ams @xcite ; and * the stellar fundamental parameters ( sfp ) pipeline @xcite .",
    "the yb pipeline was used with 5 different grids : models from the dartmouth group @xcite and the padova group @xcite , the set of yy isochrones @xcite , a grid constructed using the yale stellar evolution code ( yrec ; @xcite ) and described by @xcite ( we refer to this set as yrec ) , and another set of models constructed with a newer version of yrec with updated input physics ( we refer to this grid as yrec2 ) that has been described by basu et al .",

    "the bespp pipeline was run with two grids .",
    "the first grid is comprised of models constructed with the garstec code @xcite and the parameters of the grid are described in @xcite .",
    "the second grid is comprised of the basti models of @xcite , computed for use in asteroseismic studies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "both grids include rc models .",
    "radius was coupled to a grid constructed with the astec code ( christensen - dalsgaard et al .",
    "2008 ) , as described in @xcite and @xcite , which does not include rc models .",
    "the codes above were all employed in the grid - based analysis of solar - type _ kepler _ targets described in @xcite , where summary details of the physics employed in the grids may also be found .",
    "param was run using a grid comprising models of the padova group @xcite , again including rc stars ; further details may be found in @xcite .",
    "ams is based on an independent implementation of the yb pipeline , and was run using the basti models of @xcite .",
    "the sfp pipeline was also coupled to basti models .",
    "these grids include rc models .",
    "for this first analysis of the apokasc red giants an asteroseismic classification ( i.e. , rgb or rc ) was not available for many of the stars .",
    "therefore , no _ a priori _ categorisation information was used in the grid - based searches .",
    "although the cohort evidently contains many rc stars , we nevertheless obtained some results using grids comprised of only rgb models , to test the impact of neglecting the red clump .",
    "however , as explained below , our final results are produced using only those grids that included rc models .",
    "[ fig : diff1 ] is an example of the typical differences we see in the estimated properties returned by different grid - pipeline combinations , here those between yb / dotter and bespp / basti ( the latter chosen as the reference ) .",
    "both sets comprise results from grids that included rc models .",
    "results are plotted from stars in the public data cohort , with , @xmath6 , the revised aspcap @xmath0 , and [ fe / h ] values used as inputs .",
    "we plot fractional differences in @xmath48 , @xmath47 and @xmath59 and absolute differences in @xmath1 .",
    "gray lines mark envelopes corresponding to the median of the @xmath60 uncertainties returned by all grid pipelines .",
    "medians were calculated in 10-target batches sorted on .",
    "these lines are included to help judge the _ typical _ precision only ; uncertainties in the results of individual targets may of course be slightly different . similar trends to those present here are seen in results on the pixel and cluster target cohorts , and in results from using the raw aspcap @xmath0 and [ fe / h ] scales as inputs .    on the whole , the differences lie within the median formal uncertainty envelopes , which is encouraging , i.e. , the scatter between different grid - pipeline combinations tends to be smaller than the typical intrinsic , formal uncertainties returned by those pipelines .",
    "however , we do see clear excess scatter centered on @xmath61 , which corresponds to the location of rc stars .",
    "a significant fraction of our target sample lies in this region .",
    "further analysis presented below suggests that this is genuine extra scatter , and not a sampling effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fin2a_1 ] in section  [ sec : cat ] and accompanying discussion ) .",
    "the presence of this scatter evidently reflects the difficulty of discriminating between rc and rgb models when no _ a priori _ categorisation is used as input , as was the case here .",
    "differences with respect to the reference results of bespp / basti tend , not surprisingly , to be more pronounced for grids which did not include rc models .",
    "grid - pipeline combinations with no rc models appear to compensate for the absence of the clump by the inclusion of high - mass ( lower - age ) rgb solutions , which are not present in the rc sets .",
    "although at the lowest masses the results for grids with and without rc models are similar , the mapping to age is of course different : grid - pipeline combinations with no rc models yield older solutions at the _ same _ mass .",
    "the lack of _ a priori _ information on the evolutionary state has significant implications for our ability to return not only robust estimates of the absolute ages , but even accurate measures of the relative ages of the cohort , i.e. , the relative chronology will be scrambled if an rc star is incorrectly matched to a model of an rgb star , or vice versa . indeed , the problem is even more subtle .",
    "the grid - based codes compute a likelihood for every model that is a reasonable match ( within several sigma ) to the observables .",
    "estimated properties are returned from the distributions formed by these likelihoods , i.e. , the analysis is probabilistic in nature . without information on the evolutionary state , the distribution functions",
    "may be comprised of a mix of rc and rgb information .",
    "that is why , for now , we do not provide ages explicitly in the catalog ( although the reader may compute their own ages from the masses and metallicities provided ) .",
    "@xcite noted that the oscillation spectra of the giants can be used to distinguish between rc and rgb stars , and we discussed methods earlier in the text that could provide automated estimation of evolutionary state for many targets in the sample .",
    "unfortunately , our initial screening procedure only produced evolutionary state diagnostics for @xmath62 of the targets .",
    "we are in the process of developing more efficient tools that will provide measurements for an even larger fraction of the sample .",
    "thus although we do not have the information now , the desired evolutionary information will be available to help construct the next version of the catalog .",

    "results for the pixel and cluster cohorts show similar trends .",

    "the lines follow the median @xmath60 envelopes of the uncertainties .",
    "the top right - hand panel presents the corrected aspcap [ fe / h ] minus the raw aspcap [ fe / h ] .",

    "the relations imply that , all other things being equal , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , while the seismic estimates of @xmath59 are not affected by the change to @xmath0 . the plotted property differences are thus seen to reflect , to good approximation , the trend in @xmath0 ,",
    "although this clearly does not explain all the differences , i.e. , there is also the impact of the changes in [ fe / h ] to consider ( which are for example apparent in the small differences seen in the estimates of @xmath59 ) .",
    "we provide tables of estimated properties for each of the raw aspcap and corrected aspcap scales ( see tables 4 and 5 below ) . for both sets of inputs ,",
    "the properties in the catalog are those that were returned by bespp / basti .",

    "we instead opted to reflect those differences in the quoted final uncertainties , by taking into account the scatter between results returned by the different grid - pipeline combinations .",

    "moreover , both the scatter _ and _ the formal uncertainties are larger at the @xmath44 where we find rc stars .",
    "this result again emphasizes the extra challenges posed for the grid searches in this part of the parameter space in the absence of an _ a priori _ categorisation .",

    "the most striking aspect of all the histograms is their gaussian - like appearance ( see similar results for solar - type stars in @xcite ) .",
    "our median final uncertainties are approximately 12% in mass , 5% in radius , 0.01dex in @xmath67 , and 3% in density .",

    "estimated properties for the cluster stars all came from analyses of the cluster data .",
    "a question that might be legitimately be asked is why should we resort to grid - based modeling , which makes our results model dependent , when the direct use of equation  [ eq : dnu ] and equation  [ eq : numax ] could , in principle , produce model - independent results .",
    "the issue is that the scaling relations assume that all values of @xmath0 are possible for a star of a given mass and radius and are unconstrained by the equations of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "thus it is quite possible that observational errors in @xmath0 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 can produce estimated values of mass and radius inconsistent with the theory of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the grid - based method takes this constraint into account implicitly , as well as including metallicity information not used in the scaling relations .",
    "properties of asteroseismic grid - modeling results have been studied in detail by gai et al .",
    "they showed that propagated errors are in general smaller in grid - based results than those inferred from propagating scaling relations .",
    "the gai et al .",

    "[ fig : simradius ] we show histograms of the fractional difference between the true and inferred radius and mass for these stars obtained with both the scaling relations and through a grid - based search . in both cases , the distribution of the deviation between the true and the inferred properties is sharper for the grid - based method .",
    "although differences between the distributions are not as large as in the case of main - sequence or subgiant stars , the difference , particularly in mass , is large enough that it is worth performing grid modeling for our sample to reduce our random uncertainties . as discussed above , grid modeling is more challenging in the @xmath1 regime where both the rgb and rc are present , and rc models and stars are not included in this comparison .",
    "we present our data in three tables .",
    "table 3 contains basic information on the stars , and our asteroseismic parameters for the raw and corrected temperature scale are given in tables 4 and 5 .",
    "we begin in table 3 with the information in common for both sets of spectroscopic inputs .",
    "we begin with star identifiers and positional information : the kic ( first column ) and 2mass ( second column ) ids of the targets ; ra and dec ( j2000 ) , galactic longitude l and latitude b ( all in degrees ) are presented in columns 3 - 6 .",
    "we present two different @xmath0 measurements ( in k ) estimates using the ghb09 methodology in columns 7 and 8 : one with the kic extinction and the other with zero extinction .",
    "the uncertainties reflect random errors in the @xmath70 color used for the temperature estimates .",
    "this is distinct from the published effective temperatures presented in @xcite , which used either sdss filters or the @xcite irfm temperatures from 2mass colors . for each star that passed our internal consistency checks ,",
    "we then provide the mean asteroseismic properties @xmath5 and @xmath71 ( in @xmath72hz ) and their uncertainties in columns 9 and 10 .",
    "the final column includes the targeting flags used to select the stars for apogee observations .",
    "stars included in go proposal @xmath13 are labelled go ; stars targeted as public giants are public ( note that this includes almost all targets not newly observed for the go program . )",
    "a small number of asteroseismic  dwarfs  with long cadence frequency measurements are labeled as seis dwarf .",
    "our detection efficiency was a function of surface gravity , which reflects physical and sampling effects that make obtaining reliable results more challenging for some targets than for others .",
    "the highest gravity stars had oscillation frequencies close to the nyquist frequency , which can create model - dependent results .",
    "low gravity stars have fewer modes and their interpretation is also more model dependent .",
    "the stars for which we did not obtain consistent results were clustered around these two categories . for the analysis of the full dr12 catalog we intend to reanalyze and report results for all targets with detections , but we did not proceed with the full analysis of such objects in our initial run .",

    "the scatter around the kic [ fe / h]-corrected aspcap [ m / h ] relationship increases toward lower metallicity stars ; this result is not surprising for a photometric system , which tends to lose sensitivity for more metal - poor objects .",

    "those of @xcite for stars in common between the two samples indicates that there is no global @xmath1 offset between the two spectroscopic methods .",
    "because our sample is large and the uncertainties in the asteroseismic gravities are small , our mean offset of -0.175 dex between the kic and asteroseismic scales is highly statistically significant , which differs from the -0.05 dex offset reported by @xcite .",
    "since the two methods agree in their results for the stars in common , the origin of this difference is likely to be in sampling effects ( e.g. our sample includes stars where the asteroseismic and kic surface gravities simply disagree more on average than a typical star in the smaller thygesen sample ) .",
    "the zero point offset between the corrected spectroscopic temperatures and those of thygesen is comparable in magnitude and sign with that inferred relative to the photometric ghb09 scale . the temperature zero - point offsets , however , appear to have minimal impact on the metallicities or surface gravities .",

    "however , with the addition of asteroseismic surface gravities , fine structure can clearly be seen in a field population without parallax data . both the red clump and the secondary red clump can be clearly distinguished , and the red giant branch bump ( typically detected only in star clusters ) is clearly visible .",
    "we can also examine trends in mass at fixed metallicity ( illustrated in figure  [ fig : fehtrends ] ) and in metallicity at fixed mass ( illustrated in figure  [ fig : masstrends ] ) .",
    "the overall trends predicted by stellar models are clearly seen , with metal - poor stars being systematically hotter at fixed @xmath1 and mass than metal - rich ones .",
    "similarly , higher mass stars , as expected , are systematically hotter at fixed metallicity than lower mass stars .",
    "the agreement between theory and data degrades for the lowest mass stars , which could imply a mass - dependent shift in the locus of the giant branch .",
    "however , this may simply be a stellar population effect : the limited age of the disk places a hard lower bound on the true mass of evolved red giants .",
    "stars with formal mass estimates at or close to this value are likely to be higher mass stars scattered to a low apparent mass by errors in their data , and they will thus appear offset relative to expectations . for the yrec models",
    "there is good agreement at low metallicity but there appears to be an offset in the temperature locus between the metal - rich track and the metal - rich data .",
    "this result is more robust than that in the mass plane and is tentative evidence for a metallicity - dependent offset between the expected and observed hr diagram position at fixed mass .",

    "we now have a dataset measured in the natural co - ordinate for stellar evolution calculations , namely mass .",
    "this permits direct tests of stellar evolution tracks using isolated field stars , as opposed to relying on membership in well - studied binary systems or star clusters .",
    "asteroseismic data is particularly precise and accurate for surface gravities , which is a stringent test of model atmospheres theory .",
    "our combined data delineate stellar populations in the field with a precision usually associated with star clusters , and asteroseismic evolutionary state diagnostics confirm the assignments ( such as red clump , secondary red clump , or red giant branch ) that would have been expected from the hr diagram positions of the stars .",
    "differential mass trends ( at fixed metallicity ) and metallicity trends ( at fixed mass ) are in the expected sense , which is a powerful confirmation of expectations from stellar interiors theory . at a deeper level ,",
    "interesting trends in the differences between theory and data for both atmospheres and interiors models are clearly present and worthy of further exploration .",
    "typical uncertainties in our catalog are of order 80 k in @xmath0 , 0.06 dex in [ m / h ] , 0.014 dex in @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 in mass and radius , respectively .",
    "there are additional systematic error sources that could be important and which should be explored .",
    "for example , a zero - point shift in the @xmath0 scale is plausible given the differences between photometric and spectroscopic inferences for our targets , which would induce correlated changes in the mass and radius values .",

    "the accurate stellar properties and distances available in the apokasc sample in the _ kepler _ field are also useful for calibrating stellar - population tracers , such that the power of the apokasc sample can be leveraged to the large galactic volume covered by the full apogee survey . as an example of this potential",
    ", @xcite recently developed a new method for selecting rc stars from spectro - photometric data that is calibrated using the precise seismic @xmath1 and evolutionary - state classifications in the apokasc catalog .",
    "the distances to stars in the resulting apogee - rc catalog are accurate to @xmath132 , allowing for a detailed mapping of the structure of the galactic disk .",
    "the seismic data are also useful to check for systematic errors in the rc distance scale , which is calibrated using _ hipparcos _ parallaxes : the direct seismic distances for 593 rc stars in common between the apogee - rc catalog and the rodrigues et al .",
    "( 2014 ) distance catalog agree to better than @xmath133 .    at the same time",
    ", there are important factors that should be accounted for when interpreting and using the data .",
    "there are significant sample selection effects , imposed by the target selection process for both _",
    "kepler _ and apogee .",
    "these selection effects are not simple ones ( for example , magnitude or color cuts ) , and they reflect the fact that the asteroseismic data was obtained from a survey designed for a very different purpose ( detecting extrasolar planets . ) direct stellar populations inferences from our targets therefore require careful population modeling , which is outside the scope of our paper .",
    "the availability of stellar masses is especially valuable for red giant stars , as the natural process of stellar evolution channels stars of very different masses and ages into similar locations on the hr diagram .",
    "the two major methods for inferring stellar masses also have significant limitations when applied to evolved stars , making an additional mass diagnostic even more important .",
    "direct mass measurements from binary stars are uncommon for physically large red giant stars .",
    "indirect mass estimates for red giants in star clusters are subject to significant systematic uncertainties in cluster ages , distances , extinctions , and the mapping from turnoff properties to stellar mass . by the same token , however , our asteroseismic masses have only a limited set of calibrators .",
    "our radii are based on the same scaling relations used in @xcite and @xcite , which reported good agreement with independent tests using stars with measured parallaxes and interferometric angular size measurements , particularly at solar metallicity .",
    "however , data at higher and lower metallicity are more limited , and there could be metallicity - dependent offsets in the mass scale .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that the masses derived from scaling relations for metal - poor stars were consistently higher than those expected from other astrophysical constraints .",
    "@xcite found evolutionary - state dependent differences between the radii inferred for red clump and red giant branch stars in the metal - rich open cluster ngc 6791 . as a result",
    ", there could be systematic trends in our inferred masses and radii not captured in our analysis .",
    "there are systematic differences between the spectroscopic and asteroseismic surface gravities that appear to be a function of evolutionary state as well .",
    "calibration of the asteroseismic masses and radii , and understanding the origin of the trends that have been identified , is ongoing .",
    "work is in progress on the next combined dataset , which will feature much larger numbers of targets and considerably broader phase space coverage in metallicity and surface gravity .",
    "our asteroseismic uncertainties reflect a combination of systematic and random error sources , and work is in progress to assess both separately .",
    "we also adopted separate external calibrators for each of our spectroscopic parameters ; in the next version of the catalog we will explore the consequences of iterating between the asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters and exploring the impact of adopting an asteroseismic gravity prior for the spectroscopic solution . in the current paper we employed a conservative concordance criterion for our asteroseismic sample ( see section 4.1 ) , reporting results only in cases where different analysis methods applied to the same dataset yielded similar asteroseismic parameters .",
    "this approach had the net effect of removing most of the highest and lowest gravity targets from our sample , as their data is the most subject to systematic offsets .",
    "including these in the next catalog , which will substantially increase our dynamic range in surface gravity , is another priority .",

    "<S> asteroseismic surface gravities are substantially more precise and accurate than spectroscopic ones , and we find good agreement between their mean values and the calibrated spectroscopic surface gravities . </S>",
    "<S> there are , however , systematic underlying trends with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> our effective temperature scale is between 0 - 200 k cooler than that expected from the infrared flux method , depending on the adopted extinction map , which provides evidence for a lower value on average than that inferred for the kepler input catalog ( kic ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find a reasonable correspondence between the photometric kic and spectroscopic apokasc metallicity scales , with increased dispersion in kic metallicities as the absolute metal abundance decreases , and offsets in @xmath0 and @xmath1 consistent with those derived in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we present mean fitting relations between apokasc and kic observables and discuss future prospects , strengths , and limitations of the catalog data . </S>"
