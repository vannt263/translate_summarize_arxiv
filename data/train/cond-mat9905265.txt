    "the quantum hall effect ( qhe)@xcite , i.e. the quantization of hall conductance of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in high magnetic fields at certain filling factors @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the number of single particle states in a ll per electron ) , signals the appearance of ( incompressible ) nondegenerate ground states ( gs s ) separated from the continuum of excited states by a finite gap . at integer @xmath2 ,",
    "2   ( iqhe ) , the excitation gap is the single particle cyclotron gap , while at fractional @xmath3 , 1/5 , 2/5    ( fqhe ) electrons partially fill a degenerate ( lowest ) ll and the formation of incompressible gs s is a many body phenomenon revealing the unique properties of coulomb interaction of electrons in the lowest ll @xcite .    in the mean field ( mf )",
    "composite fermion ( cf ) picture@xcite , in a 2deg of density @xmath4 at a strong magnetic field @xmath5 , each electron binds an even number @xmath6 of magnetic flux quanta @xmath7 ( in form of an infinitely thin flux tube ) forming a cf . because of the pauli exclusion principle",
    ", the magnetic field confined into a flux tube within one cf has no effect on the motion of other cf s , and the average effective magnetic field @xmath8 seen by cf s is reduced , @xmath9 . because @xmath10 , the relation between the electron and cf filling factors is @xmath11 since the low band of energy levels of the original ( interacting ) 2deg has similar structure to that of the noninteracting cf s in a uniform effective field @xmath8 , it was proposed@xcite that the coulomb charge - charge and chern  simons ( cs ) charge - flux interactions beyond the mf largely cancel one another , and the original strongly interacting system of electrons is converted into one of weakly interacting cf s .",
    "consequently , the fqhe of electrons was interpreted as the iqhe of cf s .",
    "although the mfcf picture correctly predicts the structure of low energy spectra of fqh systems , the energy scale it uses ( the cf cyclotron energy @xmath12 ) is totally irrelevant .",
    "moreover , since the characteristic energies of cs ( @xmath13 ) and coulomb ( @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the magnetic length ) interactions between fluctuations beyond mf scale differently with the magnetic field , the reason for its success can not be found in originally suggested cancellation between those interactions .",
    "since the mfcf picture is commonly used to interpret various numerical and experimental results , it is very important to understand why and under what conditions it is correct .    in this paper",
    ", we use the pseudopotential formalism@xcite to study the fqh systems .",
    "it is shown that the form of the pseudopotential @xmath16 [ pair energy vs. pair angular momentum ] rather than of the interaction potential @xmath17 , is responsible for the incompressibility of fqh states .",
    "the idea of fractional parentage@xcite is used to characterize many body states by the ability of electrons to avoid pair states with largest repulsion .",
    "the condition on the form of @xmath16 necessary for the occurrence of fqh states is given , which defines the class of sr pseudopotentials to which mfcf picture can be applied . as an example",
    ", we explain the success or failure of mfcf predictions for the systems of electrons in the lowest and excited ll s , laughlin quasiparticles ( qp s ) in the hierarchy picture of fqh states @xcite , and charged excitons in a 2d electron - hole plasma@xcite .",
    "because of the ll degeneracy , the electron - electron interaction in the fqh states can not be treated perturbatively , and the exact ( numerical ) diagonalization techniques have been commonly used . in order to model an infinite 2deg by a finite ( small ) system that can be handled numerically , it is very convenient to confine @xmath18 electrons to a surface of a ( haldane ) sphere of radius @xmath19 , with the normal magnetic field @xmath5 produced by a magnetic monopole of integer strength @xmath20 ( total flux of @xmath21 ) in the center@xcite .",
    "the obvious advantages of such geometry is the absence of an edge and preserving full 2d symmetry of a 2deg ( good quantum numbers are the total angular momentum @xmath22 and its projection @xmath23 ) .",
    "the numerical experiments in this geometry have shown that even relatively small systems that can be solved exactly on a small computer behave in many ways like an infinite 2deg , and a number of parameters of a 2deg ( e.g. characteristic excitation energies ) can be obtained from such small scale calculations .",
    "the single particle states on a haldane sphere ( monopole harmonics ) are labeled by angular momentum @xmath24 and its projection @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the energies , @xmath26/2s$ ] , fall into degenerate shells and the @xmath4th shell ( @xmath27 , 1 ,  ) corresponds to the @xmath4th ll . for the fqh states at filling factor @xmath28 , only the lowest ,",
    "spin polarized ll need be considered .",
    "the object of numerical studies is to diagonalize the electron - electron interaction hamiltonian @xmath29 in the space of degenerate antisymmetric @xmath18 electron states of a given ( lowest ) ll .",
    "although matrix @xmath29 is easily block diagonalized into blocks with specified @xmath23 , the exact diagonalization becomes difficult ( matrix dimension over @xmath30 ) for @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( @xmath3)@xcite .",
    "typical results for ten electrons at filling factors near @xmath3 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "energy @xmath33 , plotted as a function of @xmath22 in the magnetic units , includes shift @xmath34 due to charge compensating background .",
    "there is always one or more @xmath22 multiplets ( marked with open circles ) forming a low energy band separated from the continuum by a gap . if the lowest band consists of a single @xmath35 gs ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]d ) , it is expected to be incompressible in the thermodynamic limit ( for @xmath36 at the same @xmath0 ) and an infinite 2deg at this filling factor is expected to exhibit the fqhe .",
    "the mfcf interpretation of the spectra in fig .  [ fig1 ] is the following .",
    "the effective magnetic monopole strength seen by cf s is@xcite @xmath37 and the angular momenta of lowest cf shells ( cf ll s ) are @xmath38 @xcite . at @xmath39 , @xmath40 and ten",
    "cf s fill completely the lowest cf shell ( @xmath35 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the excitations of the @xmath41 cf gs involve an excitation of at least one cf to a higher cf ll , and thus ( if the cf - cf interaction is weak on the scale of @xmath12 ) the @xmath41 gs is incompressible and so is laughlin@xcite @xmath3 gs of underlying electrons .",
    "the lowest lying excited states contain a pair of qp s : a quasihole ( qh ) with @xmath42 in the lowest cf ll and a quasielectron ( qe ) with @xmath43 in the first excited one .",
    "the allowed angular momenta of such pair are @xmath44 , 2 ,  , 10 .",
    "the @xmath44 state usually has high energy and the states with @xmath45 form a well defined band with a magnetoroton minimum at a finite value of @xmath22 .",
    "the lowest cf states at @xmath46 and 28 contain a single qe and a single qh , respectively ( in the @xmath41 cf state , i.e. the @xmath3 electron state ) , both with @xmath47 , and the excited states will contain additional qe - qh pairs . at @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    "the lowest bands correspond to a pair of qp s , and the values of energy within those bands define the qp - qp interaction pseudopotential @xmath50 . at @xmath48",
    "there are two qe s each with @xmath51 and the allowed angular momenta ( of two identical fermions ) are @xmath35 , 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 , while at @xmath52 there are two qh s each with @xmath53 and @xmath35 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , and 10 .",
    "finally , at @xmath54 , the lowest band contains three qe s each with @xmath55 in the laughlin @xmath3 state , ( in the fermi liquid picture , interacting with one another through @xmath56@xcite ) and @xmath44 , @xmath57 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and 9 .",
    "the two body interaction hamiltonian @xmath29 can be expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath16 is the interaction pseudopotential@xcite and @xmath59 projects onto the subspace with angular momentum of pair @xmath60 equal to @xmath61 . for electrons confined to a ll",
    ", @xmath61 measures the average squared distance @xmath62@xcite , @xmath63 and larger @xmath61 corresponds to smaller separation . due to the confinement of electrons to one ( lowest ) ll , interaction potential @xmath17 enters hamiltonian @xmath29 only through a small number of pseudopotential parameters @xmath64 , where @xmath65 , relative pair angular momentum , is an odd integer .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare coulomb pseudopotentials @xmath16 calculated for a pair of electrons on the haldane sphere each with @xmath66 , 15/2 , 10 , and 25/2 , in the lowest and first excited ll .    for the reason that will become clear later , @xmath16",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath67 .",
    "all pseudopotentials in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] increase with increasing @xmath61 .",
    "if @xmath16 increased very quickly with increasing @xmath61 ( we define ideal sr repulsion as : @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) , the low lying many body states would be the ones maximally avoiding pair states with largest @xmath61@xcite . at filling factor @xmath70",
    "( @xmath25 is odd ) the many body hilbert space contains exactly one multiplet in which all pairs completely avoid states with @xmath71 .",
    "this multiplet is the @xmath35 incompressible laughlin state@xcite and it is an exact gs of @xmath72 .",
    "the ability of electrons in a given many body state to avoid strongly repulsive pair states can be conveniently described using the idea of fractional parentage@xcite .",
    "an antisymmetric state @xmath73 of @xmath18 electrons each with angular momentum @xmath24 that are combined to give total angular momentum @xmath22 can be written as @xmath74 here , @xmath75 denote product states in which @xmath76 are added to obtain @xmath61 , @xmath77 are added to obtain @xmath78 ( different @xmath78 multiplets are distinguished by a label @xmath79 ) , and finally @xmath61 is added to @xmath78 to obtain @xmath22 . the state @xmath73 is totally antisymmetric , and states @xmath75",
    "are antisymmetric under interchange of particles 1 and 2 , and under interchange of any pair of particles 3 , 4 , ",
    "the factor @xmath80 is called the coefficient of fractional grandparentage ( cfgp ) .",
    "the two particle interaction matrix element expressed through cfgp s is @xmath81 and expectation value of energy is @xmath82 where the coefficient @xmath83 gives the probability that pair @xmath60 is in the state with @xmath61 .",
    "the very good description of actual gs s of a 2deg at fillings @xmath70 by the laughlin wavefunction ( overlaps typically larger that 0.99 ) and the success of the mfcf picture at @xmath28 both rely on the fact that pseudopotential of coulomb repulsion in the lowest ll falls into the same class of sr pseudopotentials as @xmath72 . due to a huge difference between all parameters @xmath84 ,",
    "the corresponding many body hamiltonian has the following hidden symmetry : the hilbert space @xmath85 contains eigensubspaces @xmath86 of states with @xmath87 for @xmath88 , i.e. with @xmath89 .",
    "hence , @xmath85 splits into subspaces @xmath90 , containing states that do not have grandparentage from @xmath88 , but have some grandparentage from @xmath91 , @xmath92 the subspace @xmath93 is not empty ( some states with @xmath89 can be constructed ) at filling factors @xmath94 .",
    "since the energy of states from each subspace @xmath93 is measured on a different scale of @xmath95 , the energy spectrum splits into bands corresponding to those subspaces .",
    "the energy gap between the @xmath96th and @xmath97st bands is of the order of @xmath98 , and hence the largest gap is that between the 0th band and the 1st band , the next largest is that between the 1st band and 2nd band , etc .",
    "[ fig3 ] demonstrates on the example of four electrons to what extent this hidden symmetry holds for the coulomb pseudopotential in the lowest ll .",
    "the subspaces @xmath86 are identified by calculating cfgp s of all states .",
    "they are not exact eigenspaces of the coulomb interaction , but the mixing between different @xmath86 is weak and the coefficients @xmath99 for @xmath88 ( which vanish exactly in exact subspaces @xmath86 ) are indeed much smaller in states marked with a given @xmath96 than in all other states .",
    "for example , for @xmath100 , @xmath101 for states marked with full circled , and @xmath102 for all other states ( squares ) .",
    "note that the set of angular momentum multiplets which form subspace @xmath93 of @xmath18 electrons each with angular momentum @xmath24 is always the same as the set of multiplets in subspace @xmath103 of @xmath18 electrons each with angular momentum @xmath104 .",
    "when @xmath24 is increased by @xmath105 , an additional band appears at high energy , but the structure of the low energy part of the spectrum is completely unchanged .",
    "for example , all three allowed multiplets for @xmath106 ( @xmath35 , 2 , and 4 ) form the lowest energy band for @xmath107 , 17/2 , and 23/2 , where they span the @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 subspace , respectively . similarly",
    ", the first excited band for @xmath107 is repeated for @xmath111 and 23/2 , where it corresponds to @xmath108 and @xmath112 subspace , respectively .",
    "let us stress that the fact that identical sets of multiplets occur in subspace @xmath93 for a given @xmath24 and in subspace @xmath113 for @xmath24 replaced by @xmath104 , does not depend on the form of interaction , and follows solely from the rules of addition of angular momenta of identical fermions .",
    "however , if the interaction pseudopotential has sr , then : ( i ) @xmath93 are interaction eigensubspaces ; ( ii ) energy bands corresponding to @xmath93 with higher @xmath96 lie below those of lower @xmath96 ; ( iii ) spacing between neighboring bands is governed by a difference between appropriate pseudopotential coefficients ; and ( iv ) wavefunctions and structure of energy levels within each band are insensitive to the details of interaction . replacing @xmath72 by a pseudopotential that increases more slowly with",
    "increasing @xmath61 leads to : ( v ) coupling between subspaces @xmath93 ; ( vi ) mixing , overlap , or even order reversal of bands ; ( vii ) deviation of wavefunctions and the structure of energy levels within bands from those of the hard core repulsion ( and thus their dependence on details of the interaction pseudopotential ) .",
    "the numerical calculations for the coulomb pseudopotential in the lowest ll show ( to a large extent ) all sr properties ( i)(iv ) , and virtually no effects ( v)(vii ) , characteristic of non sr pseudopotentials .",
    "the reoccurrence of @xmath22 multiplets forming the low energy band when @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath114 has the following crucial implication . in the lowest ll ,",
    "the lowest energy ( @xmath96th ) band of the @xmath18 electron spectrum at the monopole strength @xmath20 contains @xmath22 multiplets which are all the allowed @xmath18 electron multiplets at @xmath115 . but @xmath115 is just @xmath116 , the effective monopole strength of cf s ! the mfcs transformation which binds @xmath6 fluxes ( vortices ) to each electron selects the same @xmath22 multiplets from the entire spectrum as does the introduction of a hard core , which forbids a pair of electrons to be in a state with @xmath88 .",
    "a useful operator identity relates total ( @xmath22 ) and pair ( @xmath117 ) angular momenta@xcite @xmath118 it implies that interaction given by a pseudopotential @xmath16 that is linear in @xmath119 ( e.g. the harmonic repulsion within each ll ; see eq .",
    "( [ eqharm ] ) ) is degenerate within each @xmath22 subspace and its energy is a linear function of @xmath120 .",
    "the many body gs has the lowest available @xmath22 and is usually degenerate , while the state with maximum @xmath22 has the largest energy .",
    "note that this result is opposite to the hund rule valid for spherical harmonics , due to the opposite behavior of @xmath16 for the fqh ( @xmath121 and @xmath122 ) and atomic ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) systems .",
    "deviations of @xmath16 from a linear function of @xmath67 lead to the level repulsion within each @xmath22 subspace , and the gs is no longer necessarily the state with minimum @xmath22 .",
    "rather , it is the state at a low @xmath22 whose multiplicity @xmath125 ( number of different @xmath22 multiplets ) is large .",
    "it interesting to observe that the @xmath22 subspaces with relatively high @xmath125 coincide with the mfcf prediction .",
    "in particular , for a given @xmath18 , they reoccur at the same @xmath22 s when @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath114 , and the set of allowed @xmath22 s at a given @xmath24 is always a subset of the set at @xmath104 .    as we said earlier ,",
    "if @xmath16 has sr , the lowest energy states within each @xmath22 subspace are those maximally avoiding large @xmath61 , and the lowest band ( separated from higher states by a gap ) contains states in which a number of largest values of @xmath61 is avoided altogether .",
    "this property is valid for all pseudopotentials which increase more quickly than linearly as a function of @xmath67 . for @xmath126^\\beta$ ] ,",
    "exponent @xmath127 defines the class of sr pseudopotentials , to which the mfcf picture can be applied . within this class ,",
    "the structure of low lying energy spectrum and the corresponding wavefunctions very weakly depend on @xmath128 and converge to those of @xmath72 for @xmath129 .",
    "the extension of the sr definition to @xmath16 that are not strictly in the form of @xmath130 is straightforward .",
    "if @xmath131 for @xmath71 and @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath16 increases more quickly than linearly as a function of @xmath67 in the vicinity of @xmath134 , then pseudopotential @xmath16 behaves like a sr one at filling factors near @xmath70 .",
    "it follows from fig .  [ fig2]a that the coulomb pseudopotential in the lowest ll satisfies the sr condition in the entire range of @xmath61 ; this is what validates the mfcf picture for filling factors @xmath135 .",
    "it also explains the formation of incompressible states of charged magneto - excitons ( @xmath136 ) formed in the electron - hole plasma@xcite .",
    "however , in a higher , @xmath4th ll this is only true for @xmath137 ( see fig .  [ fig2]b for @xmath138 ) and the mfcf picture is valid only for @xmath139 ( filling factor in the @xmath4th ll ) around and below @xmath140 .",
    "indeed , the mfcf features in the ten electron energy spectra around @xmath3 ( in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) are absent for the same fillings of the @xmath138 ll @xcite .",
    "one consequence of this is that the mfcf picture or laughlin like wavefunction can not be used to describe the reported@xcite incompressible state at @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "the correlations in the @xmath143 gs are different than at @xmath3 ; the origin of ( apparent ) incompressibility can not be attributed to the formation of a laughlin like @xmath142 state ( in which pair states with smallest average separation @xmath62 are avoided ) on top of the @xmath144 state and connection between the excitation gap and the pseudopotential parameters is different .",
    "this is clearly visible in the dependence of the excitation gap @xmath145 on the electron number @xmath18 , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for @xmath3 and 1/5 fillings of the lowest and first excited ll .",
    "the gaps for @xmath146 behave very similarly as a function of @xmath18 in both ll s , while it is not even possible to make a conclusive statement about degeneracy or incompressibility of the @xmath143 state based on our data for up to eleven electrons .",
    "the sr criterion can be applied to the qp pseudopotentials to understand why qp s do not form incompressible states at all laughlin filling factors @xmath147 in the hierarchy picture@xcite of fqh states .",
    "lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b and f mark @xmath56 and @xmath148 for the laughlin @xmath3 state of ten electrons .",
    "clearly , the incompressible states with a large gap will be formed by qh s at @xmath149 and by qe s at @xmath150 , explaining strong fqhe of the underlying electron system at jain @xmath151 and 2/5 fractions , respectively . on the other hand , there is no fqhe at @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) or @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) , and the gap above possibly incompressible @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) and @xmath158 ( @xmath159 ) states should be very small , which agrees very well with exact few electron calculations .",
    "we believe that taking into account the behavior of involved qp pseudopotentials on all levels of hierarchy should explain all observed odd denominator fqh fillings and allow prediction of their relative stability ( without using trial wavefunctions involving multiple ll s and projections onto the lowest ll needed in the jain@xcite picture ) .",
    "using the pseudopotential formalism , we have described the fqh states in terms of the ability of electrons to avoid strongly repulsive pair states .",
    "we have defined the class of sr pseudopotentials leading to the formation of incompressible fqh states .",
    "we argue that the mfcf picture is justified for the sr interactions and fails for others .",
    "the pseudopotentials of the coulomb interaction in excited ll s and of laughlin qp s in the @xmath3 state are shown to belong to the sr class only at certain filling factors .",
