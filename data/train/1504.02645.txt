    "an intriguing alternative about the nature of dark energy , which was also intensively investigated in the literature , is the possibility that it could be described by a vector field , which can be at the origin of the present stage of cosmic acceleration . in its simplest formulation",

    "<S> based on the analogy with superconductor physics we consider a scalar - vector - tensor gravitational model , in which the dark energy action is described by a gauge invariant electromagnetic type functional . by assuming that the ground state of the dark energy is in a form of a condensate with the u(1 ) symmetry spontaneously broken , the gauge invariant electromagnetic dark energy can be described in terms of the combination of a vector and of a scalar field ( corresponding to the goldstone boson ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational field equations are obtained by also assuming the possibility of a non - minimal coupling between the cosmological mass current and the superconducting dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological implications of the dark energy model are investigated for a friedmann - robertson - walker homogeneous and isotropic geometry for two particular choices of the electromagnetic type potential , corresponding to a pure electric type field , and to a pure magnetic field , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolutions of the scale factor , matter energy density and deceleration parameter are obtained for both cases , and it is shown that in the presence of the superconducting dark energy the universe ends its evolution in an exponentially accelerating vacuum de sitter state . by using the formalism of the irreversible thermodynamic processes for open systems we interpret the generalized conservation equations in the superconducting dark energy model as describing matter creation . </S>",
    "<S> the particle production rates , the creation pressure and the entropy evolution are explicitly obtained . </S>"
