    "the answer can be found using the knowledge in the physics of nonlinear processes in relativistic laser plasmas .",

    "the nonlinear character of this interaction results in the formation of electron density modulations , including dense electron bunches and/or thin electron layers moving with relativistic velocity .",
    "an interaction of the same or another electromagnetic wave with these relativistic objects can be reduced to the wave reflection from relativistic mirrors , which is accompanied by the relativistic frequency shift and change of the reflected wave amplitude .",

    "<S> relativistic flying mirrors in plasmas are realized as thin dense electron ( or electron - ion ) layers accelerated by high - intensity electromagnetic waves to velocities close to the speed of light in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection of an electromagnetic wave from the relativistic mirror results in its energy and frequency changing . in a counter - propagation configuration , the frequency of the reflected wave </S>",
    "<S> is multiplied by the factor proportional to the lorentz factor squared . </S>",
    "<S> this scientific area promises the development of sources of ultrashort x - ray pulses in the attosecond range . the expected intensity will reach the level at which the effects predicted by nonlinear quantum electrodynamics start to play a key role </S>"
