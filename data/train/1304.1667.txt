    "optical and near - infrared observations indicate that nearly @xmath7 of disc galaxies in the local universe are strongly barred @xcite .",
    "however , the fraction of barred disc galaxies might have significantly increased from high redshift until the present day . whereas some studies indicate that it is nearly constant up to @xmath8 @xcite other studies indicate a decrease in bar fraction towards higher redshift to values as low as @xmath9% at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a common message from these observational studies is that bars can form in their host stellar discs , embedded in diverse environments , and survive through @xmath11  gyrs of look - back time",
    ".    the formation mechanisms of a bar have been mostly studied with n - body simulations .",
    "they can either form as a result of swing - amplification of gravitationally unstable @xmath12 modes in a stellar disc @xcite , triggered by galaxy interactions and mergers @xcite or through the cooperation of orbital streams which eventually lead to formation of a bar @xcite .",
    "interaction with dark matter halo substructures @xcite as well as the resonant gravitational interaction with the surrounding dark matter particles has been shown to promote bar formation @xcite . without interactions or in otherwise isolated environments ,",
    "the formation and evolution of bars in disc galaxies strongly depends on the properties of the surrounding dark matter halo .",
    "it has been known for a long time that a dynamically hot halo component is required to stabilize an otherwise gravitationally unstable rotating self - gravitating disc against bar formation . according to @xcite",
    ", a stellar disc will go bar unstable if the ratio of total rotational kinetic energy to the potential energy exceeds @xmath13 . if the disc is embedded in a non - rotating dark matter halo , the potential energy increases and the disc is stabilized against bar formation @xcite .",
    "this finding was again confirmed by @xcite and quantified in terms of observable parameters like disc scale length and circular velocity .",
    "however , a study by @xcite indicated that strong bars can form in cold discs embedded in massive dark matter halos casting doubts on the general applicability of the above criteria @xcite .",
    "traditionally , the dark matter halo was treated as a rigid component which does not respond to the dynamics of the disc stars . however , live dark matter halos enhance the growth of bars in model galaxies by resonant interactions of disc stars with halo particles taking away the disc s angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the exchange of angular momentum between the disc and halo has been a subject of active research over the last two decades and our understanding of the bar instability has improved significantly .",
    "most studies focused on the formation of bars in kinematically cold discs ( which easily form bars ) embedded in close to spherical non - rotating dark matter halos .",
    "the evolution of systems , especially dynamically hot discs which might even be dark matter dominated was left unexplored , mainly because such systems were not expected to form bars at all .",
    "however , such systems exist . low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies are generally isolated , without nearby companions and are dominated by dark matter at all radii @xcite .",
    "the evolution of such galaxies is expected to depend entirely on internal processes and it remains unclear how their discs become bar unstable @xcite , as @xmath14 of lsb galaxies reported in the sample of @xcite are barred .",
    "the study of @xcite indicates , that hot stellar discs inside a massive non - rotating halo are stable against the formation of strong bars ; they can form only weak bars over several gyrs . in this paper , we test the hypothesis that halo rotation - in accordance with standard cosmological models - can promote the formation of strong bars even in the presence of massive dark matter halos .",
    "one of the definite predictions from large scale dark matter simulations with @xmath15cdm cosmological models is that dark matter halos acquire a certain amount of spin due to the cosmic shear and mergers @xcite and they are hardly non - rotating .",
    "their spin distribution peaks at a value @xmath16 with a tail towards halos with even higher @xmath17-values .",
    "it has been suggested that rotating halos could enhance the growth of a bar @xcite as these halos have a higher fraction of dark matter particles on prograde orbits which can absorb disc angular momentum even more efficiently .",
    "we conduct a systematic investigation of the effect of halo spin on the evolution of a hot stellar disc embedded in a massive dark matter halo .",
    "the effect is tested with a galaxy model which is expected to be stable ( or weakly unstable ) against bar formation according to most of the conventional criteria of bar instability .",
    "we find that the spin of a dark matter halo has substantial effect on the bar instability and thereby on the galaxy evolution and carry out a detailed investigation using - cosmologically motivated - spinning dark matter halos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : modelsetup ] describes the construction of initial galaxy models with different halo spins and the basics of the simulation set up .",
    "section  [ sec : instability ] outlines different conventional criteria of bar instability .",
    "bar evolution and the morphology of the disc is presented in section  [ sec : evol ] .",
    "section  [ sec : opspin ] and section  [ sec : bulge ] discuss the effect of halo spin on the ostriker - peebles criteria and bulge formation respectively .",
    "section  [ sec : tam ] is devoted to angular momentum transfer and density wakes in the halo .",
    "section  [ sec : reso ] describes the resonances in the system .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "we construct @xmath5 equilibrium models of galaxy with initially spinning dark matter halos ( hereafter , isdm ) using the self - consistent method of @xcite .",
    "each galaxy model consists of a live disc , a dark matter halo , and a classical bulge .",
    "flattened models of isdms are constructed by reversing the velocities of halo particles with negative angular momenta perpendicular to the disc plane , which remains a valid solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite . in this way",
    ", we have constructed one model with a non - rotating halo ( a+00 ) , three models with co - rotating halos with spin parameters @xmath18 0.03 , 0.05 , and 0.07 ( b+03 , c+05 , d+07 ) and one model with a counter - rotating halo ( e-05 ) with a spin parameter of @xmath18 0.05 , similar to model c+05 but the halo is rotating in the opposite direction of the disc . for the definition of the spin parameter ( @xmath17 ) of the dark matter halos we follow @xcite ,",
    "@xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the mass , radius and velocity of a dark matter particle ; @xmath23 denotes the circular velocity at the virial radius ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath17 are shown in table  [ tab : paratab ] and reasonably cover the range of spin distributions of dark matter halos from cosmological simulations .",
    "an analysis of the millennium simulation @xcite indicates that the halo spin parameter only weakly depends on halo mass and shape @xcite .",
    "therefore , we changed only the halo spin parameter keeping its mass and shape unchanged to single - out the effect of halo angular momentum on the disc evolution .",
    "the disc has an exponentially declining surface density with a scale - length @xmath25 , a constant scale - height @xmath26 and mass @xmath27 . the outer radius of the disc is truncated at @xmath28 with a truncation width of @xmath29 within which the stellar density smoothly drops to zero",

    "the softening lengths for the disc , bulge and halo are @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47  pc , respectively , following @xcite .",
    "all simulations were performed using the gadget code @xcite with an opening angle of @xmath48 for the tree code performance and evolved all the models for about @xmath49  gyr . the half - mass rotation period ( dynamical time - scale ) at @xmath50 is @xmath51  myr ( @xmath52  myr ) . at the end of the simulation",
    "the total energy was conserved to about @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vcdbh ] , we show the circular velocity curve for the galaxy model constructed as described above .",
    "the model is dominated by dark matter ( and a spheroidal bulge component ) right from the central region , similar to some giant lsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "the initial stellar disc is kinematically hot and stable against local gravitational instability as can be seen from the initial radial profile of the toomre q @xcite parameter ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : toomreq ] ) , defined as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath56 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath57 is the surface density of stars .",
    ".initial spin of the dark matter halos , values of ostriker - peebles parameter and properties of bar at @xmath5  gyr .",
    "the unit of pattern speed @xmath58 is in km s@xmath59kpc@xmath59 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      @xmath60 is the length of the bar measured based on the phase angle variation .",
    "rest of the symbols are explained in table  [ tab : paratab ] .",
    "[ tab : paratab2 ]    next , we calculate the locations of the resonances in the stellar disc to see whether spinning halos preferentially create slow bars . observations and simulations",
    "( without halo rotation ) by @xcite already indicated that systems dominated by dark matter can only develop slow bars .",
    "[ fig : reso ] shows the location of co - rotation resonances when the bar has just formed in the disc and towards the end of the simulation .",
    "we have checked that there was no ilr in the stellar disc initially . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pattspd ] , we know that the nascent bar in model d+07 rotates faster than all others ( open red circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : reso ] ) with cr at @xmath3  kpc .",
    "the slowest rotating bar in model e-05 ( couter - rotating halo , open cyan circle ) pushes cr to @xmath61  kpc . comparing , the bar sizes and cr radii we find that @xmath62 which is larger than @xmath63 for all models , i.e. above the limit for fast bars .",
    "this property does not change with time .",
    "after @xmath5  gyrs of evolution the bars are in the range @xmath64 .",
    "the values for bar sizes , cr radii and pattern speeds after @xmath5  gyrs are quoted in table  [ tab : paratab ] .",
    "we conclude that all bars in the galaxy models presented here form as slow bars and they remain slow bars as the galaxy evolves .",
    "the transformation of a slow bar to fast is unlikely .",
    "increasing the spin of a halo ( to more unlikely values ) could possibly reduce the ratio @xmath65 close to @xmath63 leading to the possibility of harboring a fast bar in a dark matter dominated galaxy .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that bars in early - type galaxies are generally fast , while they could either be slow or fast in late - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have demonstrated that spinning dark matter halos promote the formation of stellar bars , the most common and most intriguing non - axisymmetric feature in galaxies .",
    "even dark matter dominated hot stellar discs , which are expected to be stable against bar formation according to traditional criteria ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* however , see @xcite ) , can form strong bars depending on the spin of their co - rotating host halos .",
    "stellar discs embedded in faster spinning halos - we have tested halos in the range @xmath66 - develop their bars up to @xmath1  gyrs earlier with a higher ( @xmath67 ) fourier amplitude ( up to peak @xmath68 ) and the final bars are longer ( up to a factor of @xmath69 ) .",
    "the essence of effect has been suggested by @xcite and is caused by more efficient angular momentum transfer from the disc to the spinning dark matter halos due to resonant interactions between disc stars and co - rotating halo particles .",
    "we have demonstrated that dynamical friction between a bar and a halo is stronger when the halo is co - rotating with the disc leading to significant transfer of angular momentum to the dark matter particles which form a bar - like structure in the inner region . as a result ,",
    "a higher local density of dark matter particles can be expected wherever the stellar bar is located .",
    "this effect is weakest in counter - rotating halos ( we have tested one model ) which thus appear to suppress the formation of bars .",
    "the presence of counter - rotating halos could plausibly explain why some of the observed massive and cold stellar discs did not form any bar at all @xcite .",
    "the dynamical friction between a rotating bar and spinning halo requires that the halo is composed of particles not just a rotating potential .",
    "hence the effect would be visible when the dark matter halo is live i.e. , is able to interact with the disk stars .",
    "in other words , rigid halos might not show the same dramatic effect .",
    "not all bars in our models form boxy / peanut - shaped ( pseudo- ) bulges in the end @xcite . although the @xmath12 peak amplitudes of all the bars are nearly the same after @xmath5  gyr , only the discs embedded in co - rotating halos with spin parameters @xmath70 went through a buckling instability phase .",
    "discs embedded in faster spinning halos develop stronger bars and appear more box - shaped in the end .",
    "the impact of halo spin on bar formation in the idealized model discs discussed here is unambiguous and might have important consequences for the formation and evolution of disc galaxies in @xmath15cdm cosmologies . as discussed in section  [ sec : introduc ] , the rotation of dark matter halos is a definite prediction from large scale dark matter simulations with @xmath15cdm cosmological models @xcite .",
    "as most of the stellar discs are expected to co - rotate with their host halos ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the formation of bars might be promoted in general .",
    "it has been shown by a number of studies that systems with already massive and dynamically cold stellar discs become bar unstable easily @xcite and a rotating halo might only accelerate the instability in those systems .",
    "more interesting is the effect on systems which traditionally were not expected to be bar unstable but are observed to have bars . in particular ,",
    "present day low - mass galaxies which are , in general , observed to be dark matter dominated @xcite and - in the @xmath15cdm framework - are expected to have converted only a very small fraction of the available baryons into stars @xcite .",
    "another class of galaxies for which the above effect might be very relevant are low surface brightness galaxies ( lsb ) .",
    "they are dark matter dominated , their stellar discs are relatively hot at a very low level of star formation despite having a similar amount of gas as in their high surface brightness ( hsb ) counterparts .",
    "lsb galaxies are generally found in isolated environments which excludes the possibility of strong tidal interaction yet bars are found in these galaxies @xcite .",
    "previous n - body simulations by @xcite showed that lsb stellar discs embedded in cdm halos are generally stable against bar formation .",
    "our study with spinning halos sheds new light on the prospect of bar formation in lsb galaxies .",
    "another interesting ( but definitely more speculative ) regime for this process to become important is at high redshift ( @xmath71 ) where star forming galaxies have hot disc components @xcite and a significant fraction of the baryons is still in the form of gas @xcite . here",
    "rotating halos might promote the early and rapid formation of bars with important consequences for instability driven bulge evolution models @xcite and , eventually , the formation and early growth of supermassive black holes @xcite .    [ lastpage ]",
