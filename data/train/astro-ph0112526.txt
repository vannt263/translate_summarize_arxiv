    "measurements of type ia supernovae have shown that the expansion of the universe is accelerating @xcite , suggesting that most of the energy density of the universe consists of some form of dark energy with negative pressure @xcite . combining measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy and observations of large - scale structure provides important corroborating evidence.@xcite two candidates for the dark energy are a cosmological constant ( or vacuum density ) and quintessence,@xcite a time - varying , spatially inhomogeneous component . in a previous paper @xcite ( paper i ) , we addressed the question of whether supernova measurements can be used to measure the equation of state ( eos ) of the negative pressure component , the ratio @xmath0 of the pressure to the energy density .",
    "the issue is important because @xmath6 for a cosmological constant whereas @xmath0 takes on different values and can be significantly time - varying in the case of quintessence.@xcite under the assumption that @xmath0 is constant , its value can be determined to better than 5 per cent by measuring several thousand supernovae distributed equally between red shift @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , we showed that a degeneracy opens up if @xmath0 is time - dependent which makes it impossible to determine accurately the current value of @xmath0 or its time - derivative .",
    "the cause of the degeneracy is that supernovae measure luminosity distance , which is related by a multi - integral expression to the eos as a function of red shift , @xmath9 .",
    "widely different @xmath9 can have the same multi - integral value .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore some pitfalls and challenges in determining the eos and its time variation using supernovae .",
    "for example , we shall show how the standard practice of considering only models with @xmath10 or only models with constant @xmath0 when doing likelihood analyses can lead to grossly incorrect results .",
    "for example , we will illustrate cases where the standard practice will suggest that @xmath0 is near -1 or much more negative than @xmath1 when , in fact , @xmath0 is significantly greater than -1 and rapidly time varying .",
    "we shall show that a non - zero value of @xmath11 is more easily detected if @xmath12 than if @xmath13 .",
    "we shall also contrast measuring @xmath0 for the negative pressure component alone ( @xmath14 ) versus the mean value for the total energy density ( including ordinary and dark matter ) , @xmath15 .",
    "the degeneracy problem is less severe for @xmath15 , but this parameter provides less useful information .",
    "we consider possibilities of breaking the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath16 by combining supernovae results with either cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements and/or the alcock - paczynski test .",
    "we shall show that neither additional test significantly improves the measurement of the time - variation of @xmath0 , although optimistic assumptions about the alcock - paczynski test suggest that the current value of @xmath0 can be measured to within 20 percent or so .",
    "we conclude that a new , yet to be found test has to be devised to resolve well the cosmic eos and its time variation . we stress that with current data it is possible to determine the eos to about a factor of two . for a future experiment to significantly enhance the determination of the eos , and enable the distinction between a constant eos and a time - dependent one",
    ", it needs to resolve the equation of state at the 10% level or better .",
    "the results of our analysis agree with many other analyses @xcite , although not always with their interpretation , and can be used to explain why some other analyses seem to indicate a superior resolving power of sn measurements alone @xcite , or in combination with other measurements @xcite .",
    "some of the latter analyses implicitly assume unrealistic accuracy in independent determination of cosmological parameters , by not including self - consistently the uncertainty in @xmath9 in all measurements .",
    "for example , assume a reported resolution of matter energy density which was based on assuming @xmath17 .",
    "type ia supernovae have intrinsic variability of about 0.15 in absolute magnitude , but currently the errors in measuring distant sn are above this .",
    "there are ongoing programs to extend the search to deeper redshifts and improve measurement quality .",
    "the proposed snap satellite plans to measure 2000 sn per year , mostly in the range of redshifts @xmath18 , and some as far as @xmath19.@xcite the anticipated error in individual magnitudes is @xmath20 statistical and 0.02 systematic error , which yields about 1% relative error in luminosity distance @xmath21 .    for our numerical estimates",
    ", we have generated 50 sn magnitudes randomly chosen from a uniform distribution in @xmath22 values , between @xmath23 and @xmath8 .",
    "magnitudes were generated from a gaussian distribution with mean value @xmath24 calculated using fiducial models .",
    "we have used our 50 points to simulate approximately 2000 sn by reducing their magnitude error by a factor @xmath25 to 0.03 from the minimal 0.15 magnitude .",
    "thus each generated point corresponds to 40 snap - like points , binned together .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath26 relative error in @xmath21 .",
    "hence , our analysis is based on a sn search more extensive than the actual snap proposal . to obtain a quantitative estimate of how well models are resolved",
    ", we use one of two procedures .",
    "first , we can find the maximum likelihood contours of the various models for each of the fiducial models and explore the degeneracy in parameter space .",
    "alternatively , we can assume that all models which predict @xmath27 within 1% of the fiducial cosmological model for all @xmath22 between 0 and 2 are deemed indistinguishable .",
    "we find that both approaches give comparable results .",
    "that is , the @xmath28 cl likelihood contours using the first procedure are roughly equivalent to the indistinguishability region of the second .",

    "( [ dl1 ] ) , but it is pedagogically useful in demonstrating that @xmath21 is sensitive only to a weighted average of @xmath15 or @xmath14 and not to their detailed time dependence .",
    "based on the previous sections , a number of lessons can be learned about measuring the eos .",
    "first , the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath21 in ( [ eight ] ) involves an integral , so we do expect some degeneracy in the determination of @xmath52 from sn measurements . to determine the eos of the dark energy itself , @xmath14 ,",
    "the total energy density must be resolved into a matter component and a dark energy component .",
    "hence , if @xmath53 and @xmath54 are not known from independent measurements , determining @xmath14 entails an additional uncertainty . for example , consider a flat universe with @xmath55 .",
    "since the matter eos is @xmath56 , it follows that @xmath57 .",
    "two models with different values of @xmath14 may produce the same value of @xmath15 and , consequently , @xmath21 , due to offsetting differences in the value of @xmath53 .",
    "the more negative @xmath15 is , the faster is the expansion .",
    "therefore , a more negative ( positive ) @xmath15 will make @xmath21 larger ( smaller ) .",
    "in addition , light from earlier times ( emitted at higher @xmath22 values ) must pass through the low @xmath22 universe to reach us .",
    "this means that changes in @xmath15 at lower @xmath22 affect @xmath21 at higher @xmath22 .",
    "the converse is not true .",
    "changes in @xmath15 at high @xmath22 do not affect @xmath21 at lower @xmath22 .",
    "= 3.3 in    consequently , it is not surprising that sn measurements of @xmath21 provide stronger constraints on @xmath52 at low @xmath22 than at high @xmath22 . in particular , if all cosmic parameters other than @xmath58 are fixed , there is a particular , relatively low value of @xmath59 for which @xmath52 is most tightly constrained .",
    "this value of @xmath60 is clearly seen in our numerical results and was noted independently by @xcite .",
    "for example , figure  [ qln8tot ] shows the eos @xmath52 for three models each of which is obtained by best fit to @xmath27 for a fiducial model @xmath61 using one of three fitting assumptions : ( 1 ) that the dark eos is constant ; ( 2 ) that the dark eos is linear @xmath62 ; and , ( 3 ) that the total eos is quadratic @xmath63 .",
    "while the real degeneracy is stronger than what is seen in the figure , we have chosen three examples to illustrate the existence of @xmath64 and @xmath60 .",
    "as can be seen , the fits disagree significantly for @xmath22 far from @xmath65 , but all fits agree near @xmath60 .",
    "= 3.3 in    unfortunately , the resolution of @xmath66 , the quantity which most interests us , is degraded when we do not fix @xmath53 but , instead , allow for the current uncertainty in its value . in fig .  [ evolution ] , we show some linear fits to simulated data generated from the fiducial model @xmath67 .",
    "the fits are representative examples which fit the fiducial model to within the 95% confidence region .",
    "the upper plot shows that @xmath52 ( with @xmath53 fixed at 0.3 ) is relatively well resolved , and particularly well resolved at around redshift @xmath68 .",
    "the resolution is not that sharp in the middle plot which shows the corresponding @xmath14 , but a special point of enhanced resolution around @xmath69 is still clearly seen . if one lets @xmath53 vary in the realistic range of @xmath70 , then @xmath14 becomes poorly resolved and the spread at @xmath60 increases significantly .",
    "similarly the spread in @xmath71 and @xmath60 increases significantly if more general functional forms of the eos are considered .",
    "we would like to stress that the constant or linear forms of @xmath14 that we use are not meant to be anything more than simple concrete examples to highlight the fact that we are dealing with a degenerate parameter space . showing that if one assumes a linear @xmath58 , then it can be resolved to , say",
    ", 50% does not logically mean that it can be measured to 50% accuracy generally since @xmath58 is resolved with different accuracy depending on its functional form .",
    "this can be illustrated with the following examples . in fig .",
    "[ sciam ] , the difference in magnitude ( @xmath72 ) for models with various eos is shown .",
    "there are three clusters of points , each of which corresponds to a simulation of sn data for pair of different models .",
    "each pair consists of a constant and linear @xmath14 .",
    "each pair can be clearly separated from other pairs but the constant and linear  members \" of a pair can not be distinguished by sn data .",
    "the examples chosen for fig .  [ sciam ] have unrealistic large derivatives ( of order unity ) and therefore start to diverge from their constant partners for large @xmath22 .",
    "more realistic examples with smaller derivatives or oscillatory behaviour will be much harder to distinguish from a constant eos .    clearly",
    "the treatment of the sn analysis is important .",
    "if it is assumed that @xmath14 is constant , the figure shows that different values can be resolved to high accuracy , but if the assumption of constancy is relaxed and a linear @xmath22 dependence is allowed it becomes clear that the data can determine well only a single relation between @xmath73 and @xmath74 and that @xmath58 is poorly resolved .",
    "= 3.3 in    the degree of degeneracy exhibited in the @xmath75 fits depends on whether @xmath14 is positive or negative .",
    "recall that if different models yield a total eos @xmath76 that is approximately equal , they are degenerate , and therefore changes in @xmath14 can be compensated by changes in @xmath54 ( or equivalently , in @xmath53 ) .",
    "the difference between the case where @xmath14 is positive is due to the specific way in which this compensation mechanism operates .",
    "if @xmath14 is positive , the curvature of degeneracy lines in @xmath77 plane is positive , as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ qc5qc ] for a fiducial model with @xmath78 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath14 is negative , the curvature of the degeneracy line in @xmath77 plane is negative , as demonstrated in the left panel of figure  [ qc5qc ] .",
    "we have found that this result is unaffected by the value of the derivative of @xmath14 , even if it is quiet large .",
    "the previous section ( and paper i ) show that the determination of @xmath58 from sn data is a more delicate process than it would seem .",
    "if we know _ a priori _ that @xmath14 is constant , then its value can be determined quite accurately .",
    "however , without this assumption , @xmath14 is poorly determined , and matters much get much worse if @xmath53 is uncertain .",
    "the analysis can be further confounded if certain common practices are followed .",
    "for example , many analyses assume that @xmath14 is constant and presume that , even if @xmath14 is time - varying , the constant- @xmath14 fit will provide the mean value over recent epochs . another common practice is to impose the condition that @xmath58 be limited to @xmath79 , based on the positivity and stability conditions that apply to most ( but not all ) forms of dark energy .",
    "we shall see that both practices can produce enormous distortions of the likelihood surface that lead to grossly incorrect conclusions .",
    "for example , we have tried to fit data generated from a fiducial model with @xmath80 , and @xmath81 over a redshift range @xmath82 .",
    "note that the fiducial model has @xmath83 for all @xmath22 . yet , if we do a best - fit assuming the prior that @xmath14 is constant , we find it to be @xmath84 .",
    "not only does the best - fit have @xmath85 , but the whole 95% confidence contour lies in a region where @xmath85 .",
    "the results are the elongated contours in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ cutqlp8 ] .",
    "the reason for such a strange result can be understood from the functional dependence of @xmath21 and @xmath14 . assuming that @xmath86 , the energy density of the dark component is given in eq.([four ] ) , @xmath87 , \\label{rhoq}\\ ] ] so increasing @xmath74 and decreasing @xmath73 have opposite and compensating effects , which tend to cancel each other s influence on @xmath21 .",
    "the exponential factor determines the quantitative details of this compensation since changes in @xmath73 need to compensate also for changes in the exponential factor .",
    "it is therefore clear that the compensation can not be perfect over a range of @xmath22 s .",
    "if we insist on the prior of constant eos ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath88 ) , the fitting procedure will pick out a value of @xmath73 which is much more negative than the fiducial value . in the figure we have picked a fiducial with a large positive derivative to illustrate our point , but it is clear from our discussion that the same problem arises when time dependence is weaker , or in cases that the eos has a more general functional form .    introducing a prior that @xmath83 can give a very misleading impression of how well @xmath73 is resolved .",
    "for example , suppose that we assume the priors that @xmath14 is constant and @xmath83 , as is standard practice .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ cutqlp8 ] , the small contours truncated at @xmath17 .",
    "they seem to suggest that the data supports the conclusion that @xmath17 with a high level of confidence .",
    "the best fit is @xmath89 . yet , this is not related in any obvious way to the fiducial model , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the values of @xmath92 per degree of freedom for the best fit models of fig .",
    "[ cutqlp8 ] are reasonable , .95 for the unconstrained fit , and 1.39 for the constrained fit .",
    "so , what appears to be a compelling result is actually a total distortion .",
    "of course , it is also conceivable that the actual @xmath58 is less than @xmath1 , in which case the same procedure of introducing a prior would falsely suggest that @xmath6 fits well .",
    "an eos in which @xmath9 has a large positive time derivative is easier to detect than one which has a large negative time derivative . in either case",
    ", the derivative must be large to be detected , as pointed out in paper i , but here we are demonstrating that the challenge is asymmetric .",
    "the point is illustrated in fig .",
    "the middle panel shows a fiducial model with a modest value of @xmath93 , and , as can be seen , this case can not be distinguished from a model in which @xmath88 .",
    "that is , the 95% cl contours overlap the line @xmath88 , corresponding to no time variation .",
    "the left and right panels show cases in which @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "the contours for the @xmath94 case ( left ) lie far from the @xmath88 line , so the time variation is detectable in this example . on the other hand , the contours for the @xmath96 case ( right ) overlay the @xmath88 ,",
    "so the time - variation is not resolved .",
    "this effect can be explained by considering the variation of the total average eos @xmath15 with respect to @xmath74 , @xmath97 : @xmath98 .",
    "\\label{erreq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we consider @xmath15 because the measurements of @xmath21 are directly sensitive to @xmath15 , so that models can only be distinguished if they have different @xmath15 . as can be seen from eq.([erreq ] ) , @xmath15 is much less sensitive to changes in @xmath74 when it is negative than when it is positive , mainly due to the value of @xmath54 being larger for positive values of @xmath74 , we conclude that , in order to detect that @xmath14 is time - dependent , it must be that the time - variation is large , roughly @xmath99 , and it helps if @xmath74 is positive .",
    "this corresponds to the case where acceleration is becoming stronger as time evolves .",
    "measurements to determine the eos of the dark energy can be direct or indirect . direct methods , such as snia observations , the alcock - paczynski ( ap ) test @xcite , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) attempt to measure the hubble parameter @xmath35 , its derivative @xmath100 and @xmath53 , or some function of them .",
    "indirect methods , such as structure formation aspects of the cmb and measurements of large scale structure ( lss ) try to infer @xmath58 from its effects on structure evolution .",
    "= 4.0 in    an example of a complementary observation is the the alcock - pazcynski ( ap ) test .",

    "the physical radial size is @xmath104 . for a population of spherical objects ,",
    "the ap test is given by equating the transverse and radial sizes : @xmath105    the ap test on its own is not expected to improve the resolution of the dark eos since it has a more complex dependence on @xmath14 than @xmath21 .",
    "what does seem promising , as pointed out by mcdonald @xcite , is that the ap test can further constrain the range of @xmath53 .",
    "[ contour ] shows the likelihood contours assuming optimistic anticipated errors over a continuous range between @xmath7 and @xmath8 of 1.4% for @xmath21 , and , for the ap test , 50 bins between redshift @xmath106 and @xmath107 measured with 3% error per bin.@xcite both simulations represent highly optimistic assumptions about future measurements .",
    "the results are interesting .",
    "the better constraint on @xmath53 from the ap test reduces the uncertainty in @xmath73 , but does not significantly change the uncertainty in the time - variation , @xmath74 .",
    "this is not surprising since even a perfect determination of @xmath53 would leave a considerable uncertainty in @xmath74 , as shown in paper i. to be sure , the alcock - paczynski test is useful and worth pursuing , and a highly precise measurement combined with a highly precise measurement of sne could determine the present value of @xmath0 to within 15 or 20 percent .",
    "however , it does not help significantly with the particular problem of pinning down the time - variation of the equation - of - state .",
    "measurements of the cmb anisotropy provide an additional probe of @xmath9 .",
    "this probe also suffers from a degeneracy problem , even in the case where @xmath0 is constant .",
    "the positions of the acoustic peaks in the temperature anisotropy power spectrum depend on the angular distance ( @xmath102 ) to the last scattering surface which , just like the luminosity distance for supernovae , depends on a multi - integral over @xmath9 , @xmath108 .",
    "in addition , the heights of the peaks depend on @xmath54 and the hubble parameter , @xmath109 . when all effects are considered , then , as shown by huey , et al .",

    ", measurements can only constrain these parameters to a thin two - dimensional surface in this three - dimensional parameter subspace .",
    "the reason why one might be optimistic about combining cmb anisotropy and sn measurements is that the degeneracy surface for the cmb anisotropy measurements is nearly orthogonal to the degeneracy surface for the sn measurements for the case of constant @xmath0 .",
    "figure  8 illustrates the small overlap between the sn and cmb degeneracy regions in the @xmath53-@xmath0 plane .",
    "other authors have considered adding the cmb contribution@xcite but they have not included the degeneracy aspect . as we shall show below , introducing time - varying @xmath9 introduces additional degeneracy that spoils the resolution even when the sn and cmb anisotropy measurements are combined .",
    "= 4 in    rather than do another complete survey , which is a major technical challenge on its own , we illustrate the degeneracy in parameter space with a simple example in which we consider the family of @xmath9 of the form : @xmath111 this form was chosen to allow significant time variation recently when @xmath112 is large and , in particular , to be similar to the models considered in paper i for @xmath113 . for @xmath113 , the degeneracy problem with respect to sn data",

    "it is clear , then , that the two measurements produce two degeneracy surfaces which intersect along a degenerate curve which passes through a range of models with varying values for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , that remain degenerate under the combined observations . for more complicated functional forms of @xmath58",
    "the degeneracy curve becomes a more complicated higher dimensional surface , and the range of degeneracy in parameter space ( say , for @xmath73 ) increases .    the complications in the process of extracting the eos from both measurements are further illustrated in fig .",

    "if @xmath141 is larger than 1/6 for our particular form of @xmath9 , we find that there is no overlap between the degeneracy curve picked out by cmb measurements and the degeneracy contour picked out by sn measurements ( where both fits assuming @xmath0 is constant ) .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "10 . in the case of negative ( positive ) @xmath74",
    "the cmb measurements that fit best suggest low ( high ) @xmath53 whereas the sn measurements suggest high ( low ) @xmath53 .",
    "if this absence of overlap were to be found in the real data , an interpretation to pursue is that @xmath0 is rapidly time - varying .",
    "yet such an extreme scenario is not favoured by most theoretical models , most of which predict a moderately time - varying @xmath0 . for the more likely case , in which the two measurements do overlap ,",
    "combining them reduces degeneracy by only a modest amount , generally not even enough to decide whether the dark energy in the universe has a time varying equation of state or not .",
    "co - adding the cmb to the sn data represents an improvement in the sense that @xmath74 and @xmath73 are more constrained than with sn data alone based on our earlier analysis or in paper i. the improvement is by a factor of four or so _ assuming a linear form for @xmath9 _ , which is significant .",
    "however , there remains a large uncertainty in the eos .",
    "furthermore , we would stress once again that the accuracy in determining @xmath0 strongly depends on its assumed functional form .",
    "the range of degeneracy obtained for @xmath74 ( a bit more than @xmath142 ) in our example underestimates the degeneracy for general @xmath9 .",
    "for example , for parabolic forms , the uncertainty in @xmath74 blows up to @xmath143 .",
    "given the extraordinarily precise data that has been brought to bear , the allowed variation in @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath53 is disappointing .",
    "an important challenge for observational cosmology is to measure the equation of state of the dark energy , @xmath58 .",
    "this can provide important information about the fundamental physics that is responsible for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "measurements of the distance - red shift relation using supernovae , perhaps combined with other direct methods such as the alcock - paczyinski test or the cosmic microwave background , would appear to be promising methods .",
    "indeed , analyses based on the _ a priori _ assumption that @xmath58 is constant suggest that @xmath14 can be resolved to 5% accuracy or better .    in this paper and paper i ,",
    "though , we have uncovered a number of problems and pitfalls that arise when trying to determine @xmath58 without making prior assumptions .",
    "our lessons may be summarized as follows :    * because measures of luminosity or angular distance depend on integrals over @xmath58 , a first degeneracy problem arises in which neither the current value and nor its time - variation can be resolved to any useful accuracy .",
    "ii ) * since the effect of dark energy on the luminosity distance depends on the combination @xmath144 rather than @xmath14 itself , a second degeneracy problem arises in which @xmath14 and @xmath54 are changed simultaneously so as to keep @xmath144 fixed .",
    "iii ) * although sn measurements may extend to @xmath8 , they are most sensitive to the behavior of @xmath58 at a modest value of @xmath145 .",
    "iii ) * consequently , if there were only the first degeneracy problem , @xmath58 could be well - resolved at @xmath59 even though it is not well - resolved for other values of @xmath22 .",
    "unfortunately , the resolution of @xmath66 is totally degraded when one includes uncertainty in @xmath54 and the second degeneracy problem .",
    "iii , especially fig .",
    "2 ) * the common practice of fitting data assuming that @xmath58 is constant can lead to grossly distorted results . similarly , the common practice of assuming @xmath146 can lead to grossly distorted results .",
    "5 shows a dramatic example in which these practices lead to the conclusion that @xmath17 and is well - resolved when , in reality , @xmath83 and rapidly increasing .",
    "iv ) * time - variation of @xmath14 is more easily detected if @xmath58 is an increasing function of @xmath22 rather than decreasing .",
    "v ) * to resolve @xmath58 with supernova data , an additional test is needed .",
    "given optimistic estimates of experimental uncertainties , the alcock - paczynski test combined with the supernovae measurements can constraint the current value of @xmath0 to within 20 percent or so .",
    "however , neither the alcock - paczynski test nor microwave background anisotropy measurements provide the needed resolution to constrain the time - variation .",
    "vi )    our principal conclusion is that a new test is required to achieve the goal of measuring @xmath58 . in devising a new test",
    ", the two considerations must be precision and model dependence .",
    "thus far , among the measurements that we have considered , the measurements which are precise give constraints on @xmath14 that are highly model dependent , leading to degeneracy problems .",
    "tests which are not model dependent turn out to be difficult to measure precisely .",
    "so , there lies the challenge .    in considering alternatives",
    ", it is critical to include practical estimates of their uncertainties .",
    "furthermore , one must consider how the new tests , themselves , depend on @xmath58 .",
    "for example , claims have been made that @xmath53 and @xmath54 have been or will be measured very accurately by measurements of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "however , those estimates are based on assuming that @xmath17 . making no prior assumption about @xmath58 , a degeneracy problem once again arises@xcite that spoils the resolution of @xmath54 and @xmath58 , as discussed in sec .",
    "vi .    while trying to devise a new test to determine @xmath14 , it is worth mentioning that a precise measurement of @xmath100 will be extremely useful .",
    "the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath35 , @xmath100 ( prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath147 ) and @xmath53 is given by @xmath148 a good measurement of @xmath100 is clearly crucial to the resolution of @xmath14 , but current tests do not probe @xmath100 directly . the next best option is to measure @xmath149 , and then estimate @xmath100 by calculating its derivative .",
    "obviously , this worsens the resolution for @xmath100 and increases the uncertainty in @xmath14 .",
    "three additional approaches that we have not tried yet are measuring the time dependence of structure growth on @xmath9;@xcite gravitational lensing ; and direct measurements of @xmath150 ( to be discussed elsewhere@xcite ) .",
