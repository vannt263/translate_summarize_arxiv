    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) are very peculiar star systems with mass in the range @xmath3 - @xmath4 m@xmath5 ( @xcite ) and relatively poor in stars .",
    "consequently they result very faint and difficult to be detected and studied in details . in the past decades",
    ", the interest in dsphs has rapidly grown up . indeed , until 2001 , only 9 milky way ( mw ) dwarf satellites ( at distance between 16 and 250 kpc ) were known ( @xcite ) while , recently , @xcite listed over 100 nearby galaxies in and around the local group , along with their relevant physical properties .",
    "if dsphs orbit close enough to the galactic center , they may lose mass and be disrupted by the tidal forces due to the galactic potential .",
    "tidal effects can be easily revealed in the sagittarius dsph which has a peculiar shape characterized by stellar debris along its orbit ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "tidal extension signatures for carina and ursa minor dsphs were also detected by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , @xcite showed that there is no evidence for the existence of a tail - like extension of the draco dsph star population beyond its tidal radius .",
    "dsph are characterized by large mass - to - light ratios .",
    "this leads scientists to infer that they are dark matter ( dm ) dominated objects ( see e.g. @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "performed a comparison between different dsph formation scenarios using a sample of dm profiles and argued that no particular model is significantly preferred among others .",
    "moreover , some authors suggest different dsph growing processes , without contemplating dm content . in this respect ,",
    "@xcite , by using numerical simulations , claim that a merger in m31 , occurred 8.5 gyr ago , could have ejected a tidal - tail toward our direction .",
    "so that , dsph could be generated from the interaction between the low - mass tidal dwarf galaxies and our mw .",
    "as far as the origin and evolution of dsphs , they can be either remnants of bigger systems , disrupted by tidal forces or affected by supernova winds that take out the overwhelming majority of gas ( @xcite ) , or small mass systems since their origin . in the latter case",
    ", they could be the building blocks of large galaxies ( with mass in the range @xmath6 - @xmath7 m@xmath5 ) while , in the absence of interaction ( merging or disruption ) , they can survive until now . to address these issues ,",
    "dsphs are nowadays intensively studied by numerical simulations to infer their formation and evolution ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , as globular clusters , dsphs host old stellar populations and , consequently , x - ray sources are expected to be most likely low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) or cataclysmic variables ( cvs )",
    ". however , one fundamental difference between globular clusters and dsphs is their central stellar density that can be at least two order of magnitude smaller in dsphs ( @xcite ) .",
    "then , at variance with globular clusters where it is thought that the high stellar density forms a nursery for lmxb through capture , in the case of dsphs any x - ray binary should be primordial .",
    "however , due to the old stellar population , lmxbs would turn off in a few hundred million years , making unlikely finding these systems in dsphs .",
    "the lower stellar density of dsph offers a contrasting environment with respect to that in globular clusters and a comparison of the x - ray source populations in the two cases may help testing the lmxb formation scenario .",
    "this is exactly the case of the sculptor dsph which was studied by @xcite who found five x - ray sources ( likely x - ray binaries with a newutron star or a black hole primary ) with @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 associated to the galaxy .",
    "this discovery , from one side proves that lmxbs can exist in a old stellar environment with low stellar encounters . from the other side",
    ", it is clearly challenging for the lmxb formation theory .",
    "hence , one of the goals of this paper is to attempt a classification of the x - ray sources identified towards our dsph sample and pinpoint local ( or candidate local ) sources . detecting x - ray sources in dsph can , moreover , help in the investigation of the dark matter component in these objects . indeed , when neutron stars form in sn ii explosions they get large kick velocities ( @xmath10 km s@xmath9 , @xcite ) exceeding the escape local velocity ( a few km s@xmath9 ) due to the stellar component of the dsph .",
    "however , if dsphs have a dark matter halo , lmxbs ( and even isolated millisecond pulsars which are direct descendant of lmxbs ) can be retained within the galaxy @xcite .",
    "dsphs are also the best candidates to host intermediate mass black holes ( hereinafter imbhs ) in their gravitational cores .",
    "this clue derives by extrapolating fundamental @xmath11 relation ( see e.g. @xcite , for the super massive bh case ) down to the typical dsph masses .",
    "in particular , imbh masses can be evaluated either via dynamical considerations or using the fundamental plane relation at radio and x - ray wavelengths ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we also mention that , within the galaxy hierarchy scenario , imbhs may be the ground seeds for the formation of super massive bhs hosted in the center of galaxies .",
    "searches for imbhs in dsphs have been attempted recently . in a",
    "very interesting paper , @xcite have anlayzed a sample of @xmath12 dsph galaxies detected by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with redshift @xmath13 and stellar mass content @xmath14 m@xmath5 . by a cross - correlation with the chandra source catalogue",
    ", it was found that 19 galaxies have at least a detectable hard x - ray source within three half light radii .",
    "moreover , for about half of this sample , there is the evidence that the x - ray source ( possibly a massive black hole candidate ) is associated to the optical nucleus of the dsph .",
    "of course , as pointed out by the authors , follow - up observations are necessary to disentangle between stellar - mass x - ray binaries and the existence of active galactic nuclei with an accreting bh as central engine .",
    "on the basis of these results , we also searched in the selected dsphs for x - ray sources with the typical signatures of accreting imbhs .",
    "although the statistics at hand is low , it is interesting that we find fraction of galaxies in our sample that appear hosting a central x - ray source is similar to that observed by @xcite .",
    "also in our case , only dedicated follow - up observations may allow to unveil the source nature .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we briefly describe the sample of objects used in our study .",
    "section 3 presents the procedure used to analyze the  data .",
    "the results for the high - energy study of dsphs are reported in section 4 and , finally , in section 5 we address our conclusions .",
    "our study is concerned with the high - energy characterization of dsphs .",
    "we select the dsph sample for which  archival data are available .",
    "we did not consider the fornax dsph galaxy since it was already studied in details by @xcite and @xcite . here",
    ", we remind that these authors found an x - ray source possibly associated to a variable star belonging to the galaxy and two more sources at the boundaries of the fornax globular clusters gc 3 and gc 4 . furthermore",
    ", following @xcite who predicted the existence of a central imbh with mass @xmath15 m@xmath5 , @xcite searched also for x - ray targets at the galaxy center . in the particular case of one of the possible gravitational centers reported in @xcite , the authors found a close x - ray source .",
    "the source unabsorbed @xmath16 kev flux is @xmath17 erg s@xmath9 @xmath18 corresponding to an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath19 erg s@xmath9 ( assuming a galaxy distance of 138 kpc ) : in the imbh hypothesis ( and assuming a bondi spherycal accretion or in the context of a keplerian thin disk model ) , the compact object seems to accrete very inefficiently .    in this paper , we focus our attention on four galaxies : draco , leo i , ursa major ii and ursa minor ( hereafter uma ii and umi , respectively ) .",
    "the draco dsph ( at j2000 coordinates ra = 17@xmath20 20@xmath21 12.4@xmath22 and dec = 57@xmath23 54@xmath24 55@xmath25 ) is a mw companion galaxy . since its discovery ( @xcite ) this galaxy became target of many observational campaigns .",
    "@xcite first derived the distance to the galaxy to be about 99 kpc through the identification of variable stars .",
    "in addition , others studies on draco variables were made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a survey with the photometry of different kind of sources ( 270 rr lyrae stars , 9 anomalous cepheids , 2 eclipsing binaries , 12 slow irregular red variables , 30 background qsos and 26 probable double - mode rr lyrae stars ) .",
    "other photometric studies were performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "draco seems to host a single stellar population older than @xmath26 10 gyr ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "according to @xcite , the draco luminosity ( @xmath27 l@xmath5 ) is comparable to that of the faintest luminous systems .    by ned",
    "we get not only the galaxy coordinates but also other interesting quantities such as the mean distance of about 82 kpc and the physical major and minor axes of 1.19 kpc and 0.72 kpc , respectively .",
    "@xcite reports a position angle of @xmath28 . for our study ks and @xmath29 ks , respectively .",
    "only four detectors were on during the observations thus limiting the coverage of the draco galaxy .",
    "the event files were reprocessed using the most updated calibration files and the ciao tool suite ( version 4.6 ) .",
    "then , we searched for x - ray sources in the @xmath30 kev by using the _ celldetect _ code choosing a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath31 for the source detection . after eliminating a few sources",
    "not recognized as such by eye , we were left with @xmath32 x - ray targets indicated by yellow diamonds in figure [ images ] we remind that the background corrected rates and fluxes of the identified sources are consistent within the errors with those estimated by using  . ]",
    "we used five  observations ( ids @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ) made in the august 2009 for a total exposure time of about 90 ks .      as far as leo i ( at j2000 coordinates ra = 10@xmath20 08@xmath21 28.1@xmath22 and dec = 12@xmath23 18@xmath24 23@xmath25 ) is concerned , ned database gives a mean distance of @xmath26 246 kpc ( thus it is one of the furthest mw companions ) , positional angle of 80@xmath23 , physical major and minor axis of 0.86 kpc and 0.64 kpc , respectively .",
    "@xcite analized this gas poor galaxy whose type ii star population and elliptical shape suggested a similarity with the sculptor system .",
    "the large distance from the mw and the high radial velocity , confirmed by @xcite , suggest that leo i is an isolated dsph , not currently affected by galactic tidal forces .",
    "however , the presence of stars beyond the object tidal radius confirms the hypotesis that some dsphs may be perturbed at least in their outermost regions by the existence of a huge amount of dark matter at large distances .",
    "recently @xcite re - analyzed the star population content of this dwarf galaxy and determined the galaxy star formation rate as a function of time .",
    "in particular , they found that leo i has a stellar population older than previously believed and older than that of the irregular leo a galaxy , although both systems have continuously formed stars . the evidence of a radial age gradient in the red giant branch ( rgb ) stellar population was shown by @xcite who estimated the stellar ages , while    @xcite analyzed the existence of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) variables .",
    "+ in our work we use the  observation ( i d @xmath38 ) of about 90 ks made on 2008 - 11 - 24 , the same being previously analyzed by @xcite .",
    "these authors cross - correlated their sample of x - ray detected sources with the catalogue of carbon rich agb stars in leo i @xcite finding no association .",
    "as claimed by @xcite , a few x - ray sources correlate in position with rgb stars ( most symbiotic binary systems have red giant companions ) .",
    "this is consistent with our results ( see section 3 ) .",
    "uma ii dsph ( with j2000 coordinates ra = 08@xmath20 51@xmath21 30@xmath22 and dec = 63@xmath23 07@xmath24 48@xmath25 ) was discovered by @xcite analyzing sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "they noted its irregular and distorted shape , probably due to a tidal disruption process .",
    "evidences supporting this scenario are found in morphological studies made by @xcite and @xcite to which we refer for more details . in spite of the dominant dark matter contribution scenario , @xcite demonstrated , via n - body simulations , that the observed properties can be well reproduced , in absence of dm , by tidal mass loss processes .",
    "so the presence / absence of dark matter in uma ii is a not yet settled issue .",
    "another still open point is related to the star population of this dwarf galaxy .",
    "@xcite revealed hints , although not statistically significant , of two distinct stellar populations , with different age and metallicity .",
    "they also detected a rr lyrae star in uma ii and evaluated a distance of about 34.7 kpc .",
    "we use a distance of 34 kpc , as reported by ned , in the analysis of  data ( i d @xmath39 ) obtained on 2011 - 04 - 21 with an exposure time of about 34 ks .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the galaxy half light radius is @xmath40 kpc and a position angle of @xmath41 .",
    "the fourth target of our sample is umi dsph at j2000 coordinates ra = 15@xmath20 09@xmath21 10.2@xmath22 and dec = 67@xmath23 12@xmath24 52@xmath25 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this dsph is one of the first mw companions revealed in the past century ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite analized the stellar velocity dispersion profiles of some dsphs , among which umi , observing that it remains approximately constant with the galactocenter distance .",
    "the authors also noted that the observed profiles were well fitted by models of luminous stars systems immersed into a dm halo .",
    "regarding the star formation history , umi shows a predominantly old ( with age of about 10 gyr ) stellar population ( @xcite ) . in that work ,",
    "the authors studied also the stellar metallicity claiming the absence of a metallicity radial gradient throughout the galaxy . according to ned",
    ", umi has a mean distance of 73 kpc , positional angle of 69@xmath23 , physical major and minor axis of 0.85 kpc and 0.53 kpc , respectively .",
    "+ we analyzed two  observations ( i d @xmath42 , and @xmath43 ) made between the end of august and the beginning of september 2005 for a total exposure time of @xmath2627 ks .",
    "@xcite analyzed the x - ray data acquired by the chandra satellite towards this galaxy and found an x - ray source spatially coincident ( within a few arcseconds ) with a radio one . assuming that the target is an accreting imbh , the authors evaluated the bh mass , which resulted to be @xmath44 m@xmath5 .",
    "however , the detection algorithm used did not allow to exclude that one false detection per ccd occurred . here ,",
    "to confirm the previous result , here we used  observations ( see the next section ) .",
    "we used the _ xmm_-science analysis system ( sas version see : http://xmm.esa.int/sas/ ) , with the most recent calibration files , to process the observation data files ( odfs ) .",
    "we obtained the event lists by processing the raw data via the standard _",
    "emchain _ and _ epchain _ tools , and following the standard procedures in screening the data provided by the three european photon imaging cameras ( mos 1 , mos 2 and pn ) on - board  satellite .",
    "we applied the analysis procedure described in @xcite .",
    "here we only remind that , in accordance with the 2xmm catalogue of serendipitous x - ray sources ( @xcite ) , we divided each epic camera event list into 5 energy bands , i.e. : @xmath45 kev , @xmath46 kev , @xmath47 kev , @xmath48 kev , and @xmath49 kev , producing one image for each energy band , plus a mosaic image in the 0.2 - 12.0 kev energy band ( for inspection purposes only ) , and carried out the source detection using the sas task _",
    "edetect@xmath50chain_. + the exposure map has been evaluated with the _ eexpmap _ task , for each camera and input image , taking into account the calibration information on spatial quantum efficiency , filter transmission and vignetting .",

    "moreover , for umi dsph we examined the catalogue of quasar candidates from non - parametric bayes classifier kernel density estimate ( j / apjs/180/67 , @xcite ) and the atlas of radio / x - ray associations ( v/134/arxa , @xcite ) .    for details about the limiting magnitude of the used catalogues we remind to the relevant publications",

    "in fact , dsph galaxies , as globular clusters , host mainly old star populations but , due to the much lower central stellar density in dsphs , x - ray sources ( either lmxbs or cvs ) are expected to be primordial objects and not formed by capture encounters . however , these x - ray sources , should already turned off making unlikely to being found in dsphs . finding x - ray sources in dsphs represent therefore a puzzling problem and in any case",
    "may allow to test the formation theories of these objects in a contrasting environment with respect to that in globular clusters ..    by extrapolating the fundamental @xmath11 relation to the dsph realm , one sees that these galaxies are expected to contain imbhs in their gravitational centers .",
    "we thus searched for x - ray sources located within the core radius of the dsphs of our sample .",
    "however , for draco , leo , and uma we did not identify any high - energy ( and radio ) sources nearby the galactic centers . then , we can only put upper limits to the mass and luminosity of the putative central imbhs .    on the contrary",
    ", it is interesting that the umi center hosts an x - ray source src 3 which correlates in position with a radio object . in the imbh hypothesis , the fundamental plane relation of eq .",
    "( 5 ) allows us to get an estimate of the mass ( a few 10@xmath165 ) of the accreting black hole possible hosted in the galaxy .",
    "we remind that the source was already detected by chandra in the past but only at the poor @xmath128 confidence level , thus leaving the possibility that the chandra source was a mere fake detection .    our analysis , based on independent _",
    "xmm_-newton data , confirms however src 3 as a possible x - ray counterpart of an accreting imbh .",
