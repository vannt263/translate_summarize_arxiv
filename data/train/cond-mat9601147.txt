[ spinstiff ]    for the final evaluation of the correlator @xmath235 we have to calculate @xmath236 . for longitudinal correlator @xmath237 in which case @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "this means that the decay of @xmath240 is governed by smaller eigenvalues and , therefore , @xmath240 is massive even for @xmath36 , which is to be compared with eq .",
    "( [ corrsorder ] ) . on the other hand , for goldstone modes we have @xmath241 and for the transverse correlator we finally have g_ij^t(r ) = _ ij a^2( ) ( m_max)^r = ( - r ) .",
    "[ tcorr ]    note that again , as before , in the replica limit our equations ( [ a ] ) , ( [ spinstiff ] ) and ( [ tcorr ] ) exactly correspond to the results of refs .",
    "in this paper , we have solved the non - compact @xmath0 model on the bethe lattice for arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "the analytical continuation procedure allows us to consider @xmath3 as being an arbitrary positive number .",
    "we find that for @xmath242 the symmetry of the model is always broken , so that the system is ordered and the order parameter has a finite value .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the system was shown to be ordered for @xmath243 and @xmath244 above two dimensions .",
    "( note that the bethe lattice is effectively infinite dimensional ) .",
    "however , for @xmath91 we find a transition from the ordered to disordered phase , when the coupling strength @xmath133 decreases . in the replica limit @xmath2",
    ", our solution reproduces exactly that for the supersymmetric version of the model .",
    "the latter is nothing but the hyperbolic superplane introduced by zirnbauer @xcite as a toy model for the anderson localization transition . in the whole region @xmath245 the qualitative picture of the transition and the critical behavior are analogous to those of the supersymmetric model of zirnbauer , which shows in turn all the essential features of the anderson transition on bethe lattice studied in refs .",
    "the success of the replica trick may seem surprising , since we know @xcite that it gives wrong result in the case of the level correlation problem .",
    "the crucial difference is that near the anderson transition only the non - compact sector of the supersymmetric @xmath104models is essential , whereas for the level correlation problem both compact and non - compact sectors are equally important .",
    "the similar reason explains the agreement between the replica trick renormalization group calculation of asymptotics of various distributions @xcite and the recent study of these asymptotics via the supersymmetry method @xcite .",
    "when the manuscript was in preparation , we learnt about the work by t. dupr @xcite who studied the supersymmetric model of zirnbauer @xcite in 3d and found the critical behavior analogous to that expected for the anderson localization transition .",
