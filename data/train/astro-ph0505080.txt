    "a variety of absorption line studies at wavelengths from radio to optical over the past three decades have found au - scale optical depth variations in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the first 21 cm evidence for changes in opacity over small scales was provided by @xcite using a single baseline vlbi observation of 3c  147 .",
    "these results were confirmed by @xcite and the first images of the small scale in the direction of 3c  138 and 3c  147 were made by @xcite using the merlin array .",
    "these results were extended to higher resolution by @xcite and @xcite using the newly completed vlba with the phased vla to image opacities with an angular resolution of @xmath620 mas or @xmath610 au ( see below ) .",
    "significant variations were detected in the direction of 3c  138 and 3c  147 while no significant variations in opacity were found in the direction of five other compact radio sources .",
    "thus far small scale absorption studies toward quasars have lacked temporal data on such variations .",
    "many pulsars have been observed to move with transverse speeds greater than 100 km s@xmath7 .",
    "thus , observations spaced over a several year period will sample different lines of sight .",
    "the pulsar data have presented conflicting results .",
    "@xcite used the arecibo telescope over a period of 1.7 years and found opacity changes in six of seven objects .",
    "@xcite observed two pulsars and find marginal evidence for opacity in the direction of one pulsar ( psr 1557 - 50 ) over a four year period . @xcite",
    "have re - observed psr 1557 - 50 and find significant changes in the opacity over a 2.5 year period .",
    "@xcite have re - observed three of the pulsars in the sample of @xcite , using the arecibo telescope over time scales of 9@xmath810 years , or spatial scales of 10@xmath820 and 70@xmath885 au .",
    "no significant opacity changes were observed and @xcite suggest that au sized structures in the ism may be quite rare . as we will show in  4.2 , the one - dimensional nature of the pulsar sampling",
    "may mean that small scale structures in the ism with low filling factors could be missed in many cases .",
    "optical fine structure absorption lines from ionized and neutral atoms show pronounced spatial variations toward binary stars with separations of a few 100s of au ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "in a few recent studies , temporal variations have also been observed over timescales of a few years @xcite .",
    "observations of the optical lines of interstellar molecules such as those of ch by @xcite , have also shown variations as a function of time . additionally , radio observations of interstellar h@xmath9co using the vla have shown time variations @xcite consistent with the optical observations of ch . however , @xcite point out that the variations of the interstellar lines in the direction of the @xmath10 crucis binary system are only prominent in the rarer ionization states .",
    "for example , the predominant ionization state shows little variation , while the d line from rarer neutral sodium shows prominent variations .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that the observed variations are due to small differences in the physical properties of the ism such as temperature , or ionization state , rather than being the result of distinct physical entities .",
    "a number of theoretical studies of the nature of small scale galactic structure have been made in the last few decades in order to understand this puzzling phenomenon .",
    "if the changes in opacity are interpreted in terms of roughly spherical entities with a constant spin temperature ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the diameter of the feature ) , then small ( @xmath6 10 au ) dense ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) features are implied .",
    "numerous authors such as @xcite , have discussed the implied overpressure and short time scale problems that such structures would have .",
    "several attempts have been made in recent years in order to alleviate these problems .",
    "@xcite proposed that the tsas ( tiny - scale atomic structure ) might be explained by a combination of lower spin temperatures and geometry ; for example , the features could be elongated cylinders or sheets with the long axis parallel to the line of sight , thus increasing the path length along the line of sight and reducing the required density .",
    "in contrast , @xcite has used one of the power spectra derived by @xcite for the size scales of galactic to suggest that the opacity variations are not physical entities , but are simply a manifestation of random fluctuations contributed by the entire range of spatial scales in the `` red '' ( i.e. noise that increases with larger spatial frequencies ) power spectrum . however , the vla data toward casa used to construct the @xcite power spectrum has a resolution of @xmath16 , and thus probes linear dimensions in the range 0.07 to 3 pc , compared to the @xmath0 au size scales ( @xmath17 pc ) probed by the vlba observations . despite the large difference between the physical size scales that were actually measured , this extrapolation of the casa data from a few thousand au to scales of tens of au predicts fluctuations at the level of @xmath18 0.1 in opacity , which is consistent with many , but not all , of the vlba results of @xcite and @xcite .    the extragalactic source 3c  138",
    "was selected to continue investigation into small scale structure in neutral opacities for a variety of reasons .",
    "the size and brightness of 3c  138 makes it a favorable candidate for an absorption study .",
    "in addition , among the seven sources examined by @xcite and @xcite , 3c  138 shows the most significant spatial variations in optical depth .",
    "thus it is the most promising candidate to re - examine both the level of spatial variations , as well to probe for the first time temporal variations .",
    "additionally , the high signal to noise absorption spectra afforded by such a strong continuum source can be used to measure the line of sight magnetic field strength in the small scale neutral gas via the zeeman effect .",
    "an upper limit on distance to the gas is 500 pc , based on the galactic latitude of the source ( _ b _ = @xmath19 ) and the assumption that the cold atomic layer is no thicker than 100 pc @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present new vlba plus the phased vla images of the absorption in the direction of 3c  138 for two epochs taken in 1999 and 2002 .",
    "these data are compared to the first epoch of 3c  138 vlba data taken in 1995 and presented in @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : a description of the new observations and their data reduction are presented in  2 .",
    "the opacity results are presented in  3 including the time variations observed in a comparison of the three epochs over a seven year period .",
    "a discussion of our results is presented in  4 .",
    "our conclusions follow in  5 .",
    "we have observed the galactic absorption ( near @xmath20 km s@xmath7 ) toward the extragalactic source 3c  138 for three separate epochs taken in 1995 ( epoch i ) , 1999 ( epoch ii ) , and 2002 ( epoch iii ) .",
    "the results from epoch i have been previously published in @xcite , while preliminary results from epoch ii were presented in @xcite .",
    "table 1 summarizes the basic observing parameters for all three epochs . for each epoch",
    "the data were obtained using the ten antennas of the vlba combined with the 27 antennas of the phased vla .",
    "the gbt and arecibo were also included in the 2002 data , but were later removed due to technical problems at both telescopes during the observation .",
    "each observation lasted for 12 hours ( including time spent on calibration sources ) .",
    "the proximity of the vla to the vlba antenna at pie town , new mexico significantly increases our sensitivity to large scale structures .",
    "note that given the different rise times of 3c  138 at the different vlba stations , the more distant ( from the vla ) antennas : st .",
    "croix , hancock , and mauna kea were not on source throughout the 12 hours of the observations .",
    "for example , the st .",
    "croix antenna was typically only included for @xmath6  60% of the total observing period , and was lost completely during the epoch i observations .",
    "henceforth , reference to `` vlba '' will refer to the combined vlba plus phased vla .",
    "the shortest baseline included in these data is @xmath21 km ( pt - phased vla ) so that structures larger than @xmath22 mas are resolved out .    in order to obtain high spectral resolution at the velocities of galactic absorption ( @xmath20 km s@xmath7 ) and good continuum sensitivity uncontaminated by absorption for calibration purposes , data were obtained in four separate ifs with center velocities of @xmath23 , 5 , 105 , 200 km s@xmath7 for epoch i and @xmath24 km s@xmath7 for epochs ii and iii .",
    "both right and left circular polarizations were recorded for each if .",
    "a summary of the different bandwidths and spectral resolutions used in each epoch is given in table 1 .",
    "the data reduction and imaging for all three epochs were performed using the nrao aips software package .",
    "the initial amplitude calibration was applied in the usual manner using the calibration tables supplied by the vlba .",
    "the delays were measured by fringe fitting on the strong continuum source 3c  84 .",
    "bandpass calibration was also determined from observations of 3c  84 .",
    "corrections for delay tracking were then applied using the task cvel .",
    "a number of steps were subsequently taken to ensure uniformity in the 3c  138 data reduction from epoch to epoch as small changes in the continuum or line images resulting from differences in calibration could mimic optical depth changes . first ,",
    "the published 3c  138 continuum image from the 1995 epoch i data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was used as the input model in fring to solve for improved delays and the rates for the 2002 epoch iii 3c  138 data . for this step ,",
    "an average of all four ifs was used in the fring solution for maximum signal - to - noise .",
    "after fring , several iterations of phase self - calibration were carried out on the 2002 4if 3c  138 `` continuum '' dataset .",
    "these corrections were applied and if 3 ( with galactic absorption ) was split off .",
    "a final 2002 continuum image was then created from the line - free channels of if 3 , which then underwent a final round of amplitude and phase self - calibration .",
    "these corrections were also applied to the if 3 continuum subtracted line data .",
    "after this procedure , the 2002 continuum image was clearly superior to the @xcite 1995 image .",
    "thus , the 2002 continuum image was used as the initial model for both the 3c  138 4if fring and the 1st round of 4if phase - only self calibration for the reduction of the 1999 epoch ii data and a re - reduction of the 1995 epoch i data .    beyond ensuring a consistent continuum model",
    ", this procedure also ensures that the three epochs will have self - consistent positions , as absolute position information is lost when self - calibration is employed . during the imaging process",
    "the data were essentially naturally weighted with small adjustments to the robustness parameter in order to create images with an east - west resolution close to 20 mas .",
    "this was necessary to account for small differences in flagging between the three epochs .",
    "the resulting clean beams ( which are quite similar ) are listed in table 1 for reference .",
    "both the continuum images and continuum subtracted line cubes from all three epochs were then convolved to exactly 20 mas in both dimensions .",
    "this convolution should minimize the effects of any remaining differences in the @xmath25 coverage of the three datasets .",
    "the data were hanning smoothed during the imaging process , so while the channel separation is 0.41 km s@xmath7 , the velocity resolution is 0.82 km s@xmath7 .",
    "each channel in the line datasets were cleaned down to the same final flux level of 30 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "the final rms noise characteristics of the three epochs are listed in table 1 .",
    "we have achieved a significant improvement ( a factor of @xmath26 ) in the rms noise of the epoch i data over that presented in @xcite , primarily due to improvements in the imaging and cleaning software , as well as , the iterative continuum modeling procedure described above .",
    "optical depth cubes were calculated from the if 3 continuum images and continuum subtracted line cubes for each epoch using the relation @xmath27ln(@xmath28 ) , where t@xmath29 is negative . before calculating the optical depths ,",
    "the continuum images were conservatively masked wherever the flux density is below 60 mjy beam@xmath7 ( @xmath30 of the peak value ) . at 500 pc ( see  1 ) , 20 mas @xmath31 au .",
    "note that since the gas is likely outside of the local bubble , a minimum distance is @xmath32 pc , implying 20 mas @xmath33 au .",
    "we will assume the far distance and a linear scale of 10 au in the remainder of the paper , but the fact that some of the gas likely lies at smaller distances ( and thus a smaller size scale is probed ) should be borne in mind .",
    "the 21 cm continuum image of 3c  138 from the epoch iii ( 2002 ) data is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the resolution of this image is 20 mas and the rms noise is 0.95 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "the brighter parts of the continuum morphology are in fair agreement with that presented in @xcite , given that the current image has four times better s / n . the low surface brightness 21 cm ( 1.42 ghz )",
    "continuum morphology of figure 1 is in excellent agreement with the 15 @xmath34 5  mas resolution , 1.7  ghz vlbi image presented by @xcite .",
    "based on @xcite the component just to the sw of image center is the core , while the linear structure to the northeast is the approaching part of the jet .",
    "the low surface brightness component in the sw corner of the image is the receding jet .",
    "these authors also review previous observations of 3c  138 and find that the source as a whole is not significantly variable .",
    "( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) used high resolution multi - epoch vlba data at 5ghz to demonstrate that the core components change by a few tens of mjy beam@xmath7 on timescales of @xmath35 years ( note that the multiple core components detected by cotton are unresolved at 20 mas resolution ) .    in order to test for variability in our 21 cm vlba data , we constructed difference maps between the continuum images of each epoch .",
    "these maps show that indeed the `` core '' changes from epoch to epoch by @xmath2 mjy beam@xmath7 , while the rest of the source is constant to within @xmath0 mjy beam@xmath7 .",
    "note that variability will not impact our optical depth calculations since : ( 1 ) the continuum appropriate for each epoch was used in the optical depth calculations ; ( 2 ) no amplitude self - calibration was transfered from epoch to epoch ; and ( 3 ) the intrinsic continuum morphology at 20 mas resolution does not change from epoch to epoch ( according to * ? ? ?",
    "* positional changes in the core components over eight years only amounts to @xmath36 mas , and these components are themselves not resolved by our 20 mas resolution data ) .",
    "it is notable that our continuum peak flux densities for all three epochs of @xmath37 mjy beam@xmath7 ( see table 1 ) are about @xmath38 lower than that reported by @xcite ( the images have the same resolution ) . the integrated flux of our data ( including the re - reduction of the epoch i data ) is also low : @xmath39 jy compared to 8.5 jy reported in @xcite .",
    "it is most likely that the previous data reduction is in error , given that the vla 1.4 ghz flux density of 3c  138 is @xmath40 jy ( vla calibrator manual ) , and it is very unlikely that a vlba image could recover so much of the flux of such an extended source .",
    "indeed , @xcite also recover @xmath41 or ( 5.4 jy ) of the expected vla flux in their 1.7 ghz vlba image .",
    "we suspect that the use of a point source model in fring during the earlier data reduction @xcite coupled with details of the self - calibration are to blame for these discrepancies .",
    "we are confident that the current method of data reduction is valid , and in any case this difference will not affect the optical depths presented below since the continuum was extracted from the line free parts of the data , and all three of our epochs ( including re - reduction of 1995 data ) agree within a few percent .",
    "figure 2 shows the average epoch iii ( 2002 ) optical depth profile along with the difference between the average epoch iii and epoch ii spectra .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the spectrum is rich and complex toward 3c  138 despite its high latitude ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "overall , the average spectra are quite similar with significant deviations only occurring in the narrow velocity component near 6 km s@xmath7 and in a broader component near @xmath43 km s@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite recently completed the `` millennium arecibo 21 cm absorption line survey '' toward 79 continuum sources , including 3c  138 .",
    "as part of their study these authors have made detailed gaussian fits to the arecibo data , being careful to separate galactic emission from absorption . since 3c  138",
    "is significantly smaller than the arecibo beam at 21 cm ( @xmath44 ) , the effective resolution is equal to the size of 3c  138",
    ". thus comparison of our 20 mas resolution data to the arecibo spectrum provides an interesting check on whether or not the physical conditions of the gas change on scales of order @xmath45 mas ( see for example merlin image in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for example , a change in the spin temperature should be apparent in the line widths .",
    "to first order , the heiles & troland arecibo absorption spectrum is quite similar to our vlba spectra .",
    "therefore , we have used their results as the initial guesses for our own gaussian analysis .",
    "the center velocities were initially held fixed at the @xcite values , and then varied slightly to improve the residuals .",
    "the maximum residual in our optical depth fit occurs near @xmath46 km s@xmath7 and has a value of 0.04 .",
    "table  2 shows the results of our analysis for the spectra at the continuum peak of the epoch iii data along with the arecibo results for comparison @xcite .",
    "a gaussian analysis for spectra of this complexity is unlikely to be unique , although , our results are in very good agreement with those obtained by heiles & troland for the four strongest components .",
    "however , although @xcite were able to adequately fit their spectrum with 6 gaussians , a seventh component at @xmath47 km s@xmath7 was needed to fit the vlba spectrum .",
    "interestingly , this is also one of the two regions where there is a significant deviation between the average epoch iii and epoch ii vlba spectra ( see fig .",
    "the arecibo data were taken closest in time to the epoch ii data , and the @xmath47 km s@xmath7 was indeed less noticeable then .",
    "although we have included it in our fit in order to directly compare with the heiles & troland results , the reality of the broad , weak component near @xmath48 km s@xmath7 is rather dubious .",
    "overall , the agreement between the vlba data and arecibo is quite impressive in center velocity , line width , and @xmath49 .",
    "although we only present gaussian fitting results from the 2002 continuum peak , neither the center velocity or line width changes significantly as a function of position or epoch .",
    "that is , only the optical depth varies significantly from position to position and across epochs ( these variations are described in more detail in  3.4 ) .    using the average spin temperature derived by @xcite for the 3c  138 absorption components of @xmath2",
    "k , we find that the average 2002 vlba total column density is @xmath50 @xmath51 . for this computation we have ignored the broad @xmath52 km s@xmath7 component mentioned above ( also see table 2 ) since its reality seems doubtful . for comparison",
    "the column density observed in emission in the arecibo data is @xmath53 @xmath51 .",
    "interestingly , given the normal assumption that @xmath54 and using @xmath55 toward 3c  138 ( ned database ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is clear that much of the total hydrogen column toward 3c  138 is atomic since the combined warm plus cold column density can account for most of the total hydrogen column . indeed , since 3c  138 is optically visible @xcite , @xmath55 is likely an upper limit to the extinction strengthening this conclusion .      from the high s / n 1999 and 2002 data obtained in this study , we have also attempted to measure the zeeman effect .",
    "that is , stokes v = rcp - lcp ; stokes i= rcp+lcp and in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath56 , where z=2.8 hz @xmath10g@xmath7 , and @xmath57 is the line of sight field strength . after careful inspection of the stokes v cubes for both epochs , we do not find any convincing zeeman signatures that meet both of the following criteria : ( 1 ) stokes v larger than @xmath58 simultaneously in @xmath59 epochs ; and ( 2 ) stokes v more than @xmath58 over more than one beam width .",
    "the stokes v spectral line rms noise levels are the same as those given in table 1 for stokes i.    near the continuum peak for the component with highest s / n at @xmath60 km s@xmath7 , we find @xmath61 upper limits for both epochs to @xmath57 of @xmath62 @xmath10 g per pixel , with similar upper limits near the core ( see fig .",
    "this upper limit is similar to the @xmath63 limit reported by @xcite , but on a pixel by pixel basis rather than for an averaged profile .",
    "if instead we use profiles that have been averaged for pixels with absorption deeper than @xmath64 mjy beam@xmath7 , we find an average @xmath61 upper limit of 20 @xmath10 g .",
    "using the `` millennium arecibo 21 cm absorption line survey '' data described in @xmath65 , @xcite find @xmath57@xmath66 @xmath10 g for the @xmath67 km s@xmath7 component , consistent with our averaged upper limit .",
    "a number of recent vla and vlba zeeman results suggest that the observed magnetic field strength often increases with higher resolution due to blending of spectral components at poorer resolution and beam dilution ( i.e. higher fields averaged together with lower field regions or oppositely directed fields averaged within the beam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results presented here suggest that the arecibo magnetic field results are not strongly affected by spectral blending ( as already implied by the close agreement between the spectral profiles presented in  3.2 ) or beam dilution effects .",
    "speculation on the significance of these low magnetic field detections and upper limits is provided in  4.3.3 .      for the remaining analysis of the small scale structure ,",
    "we focus our attention on the 0.9 , 6.2 , and 9.1 km s@xmath7 velocity channels , since they are representative of the four strongest velocity features ( see fig . 2 and table  2 ) .",
    "a position - velocity image for the epoch iii ( 2002 ) data along the cross - cut labeled ( a ) in figure 1 is shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is clear from this image that there are discrete regions of higher and lower optical depth at constant velocities .",
    "optical depth velocity channel maps are presented in figure 4 for three different velocities : 0.9 , 6.2 , and 9.1 km s@xmath7 for all three epochs . _",
    "the average value of the 2002 optical depth ( for each channel ) has been subtracted from the channel maps displayed in figure 4_. the difference in regions of higher and lower optical depth from epoch to epoch in these images is striking . to aid in assessing",
    "the significance of the optical depth variations presented in figures 3 and 4 , table 3 lists the average @xmath49 , along with the minimum , maximum , and mean values of the optical depth @xmath68 for each epoch for the 0.9 , 6.2 , and 9.1 km s@xmath7 channels . as with any optical depth map ,",
    "the uncertainty in the optical depths shown in these figures is a non - linear function that is inversely proportional to the continuum brightness and proportional to the depth of the absorption .",
    "the minimum s / n ratio of the optical depths displayed in figures 3 and 4 is 7 ( which occurs near edges of the continuum ) , while near the continuum peak the s / n is more than 100 .",
    "figure 5 shows an example of both spatial and temporal opacity variations across 3c  138 at 0.9 and 6.2 km s@xmath7 , along the position angle indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "1 marked ( a ) .",
    "the width of the shaded region indicates the @xmath69 uncertainty in the optical depth measurements .",
    "a number of optical depth `` clumps '' vary from the mean by more than @xmath58 .",
    "the typical linear distance between significant variations is @xmath2  mas .",
    "the temporal variations between the three epochs are also striking along this cross cut .",
    "the variations along cross - cut ( a ) are particularly significant since it avoids the edges of the continuum where the optical depth uncertainties are greatest .",
    "for comparison , figure 6 shows a cross cut along the position angle marked ( b ) in figure 1 .",
    "clearly in this direction there are no significant spatial or temporal variations .    since the weighting , @xmath25 coverage , and self - calibration for the line and continuum data for a given epoch are the same , the enhancements of the optical depths within a a given epoch ( above the noise threshold ) are almost certainly real .",
    "for example , if the line data were actually spatially smooth and the optical depth enhancements within a given epoch were dominated by subtle differences between the cleaning of the line and continuum images for the same epoch , the enhancements should look the same at each velocity within a given epoch and they do not ( note that each channel of the line cubes was cleaned to the same flux level ) .    the possibility for `` technical issues '' ( i.e. small changes in the @xmath25 coverage , flux , or imaging ) to affect the appearance of the optical depth maps from epoch to epoch are greater (",
    "although the data reduction steps described in  2 should minimize these effects ) .",
    "however , if small changes in the continuum morphology from epoch to epoch were responsible for the temporal changes , the variations with time should mimic the continuum difference maps described in  2 and they do not . as a specific example",
    ", there is a 50 mjy beam@xmath7 difference between the continuum flux density at the peak of the ` core ' component ( see fig .",
    "1 ) due to intrinsic variability @xcite between the 1999 and 2002 data , yet the optical depth channel maps shown in figure 4 for all three velocities at the location of the core are very similar between these two epochs ( to within the stated @xmath70 noise levels ) .",
    "also , apart from the core component , the 2002 continuum is consistently higher than the 1999 continuum ( although the difference is not consistent with a simple zero point offset ) .",
    "however , for all three velocity components , the optical depths are not at all consistent with this trend ( i.e. 1999 @xmath49 consistently higher than 2002 ; figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "indeed , difference maps of the 2002 and 1999 _ optical depths _ look nothing like the continuum difference maps , and are instead very well correlated with the spectral line difference maps .",
    "these comparisons demonstrate that the line to continuum ratios and hence optical depths are insensitive to changes in the continuum , as expected ( i.e. the line changes commensurately , except where there is a real enhancement ) .",
    "assessment of the effect of small changes in the @xmath25 coverage or imaging on the line data _ independent from those apparent in the continuum images _ from epoch to epoch is more difficult .",
    "however , there is no reason to believe that these effects would be _ greater _ than those described for the continuum data .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the temporal variations are real .",
    "current theoretical interpretations of the nature of the tsas predict different values for the filling factor of such gas .",
    "@xcite predicts that , essentially independent of the geometry of the small - scale structures , their volume filling factor would be approximately 3% .",
    "consequently , one would expect a comparable fraction of lines of sight to show opacity variations .",
    "on the basis of simulations of the power spectrum , @xcite predicts that optical depth variations of order 0.2 over transverse scales of @xmath32  au would be expected approximately 10% of the time .",
    "given the extended nature of 3c  138 and high signal to noise of the data presented in this work , it is possible to observationally constrain the covering fraction of the tsas .",
    "we use the term ` covering fraction ' to indicate that we can not directly estimate the volume filling factor , only the fraction of 3c138 covered by tsas along the line of sight . for the epoch ii and iii data",
    "we have estimated the fraction of pixels exhibiting significant opacity variations for the 0.9 and 6.2 km s@xmath7 channels .",
    "we define a significant opacity change as @xmath71 . in this relation @xmath49",
    "is the measured opacity at each pixel and @xmath72 is the mean opacity over the source .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath73 is estimated from adding in quadrature the average rms uncertainty of @xmath49 and the uncertainty in calculating the mean : @xmath72 .",
    "the total uncertainty is , of course , dominated by the average rms uncertainty in @xmath49 .",
    "table 3 lists these uncertainties for the 0.9 and 6.2 km s@xmath7 channels for epochs ii and iii .",
    "figure 7 shows histograms of the number of pixels as a function of @xmath73 for the 0.9 and 6.2 km s@xmath7 channels for epochs ii and iii . for each histogram ,",

    "although we can not similarly measure the ( volume ) filling factor it must necessarily be significantly less than the covering fraction of @xmath5 .",
    "the range of plane - of - sky physical sizes for the clumps of tsas range from 5 to 25 au ( for distances between 100 to 500 pc (  2 ) ; and a typical angular size of 50 mas ) .",
    "thus , even for aspect ratios of @xmath79 a single tsas enhancement only spans @xmath80 of the total line of sight .",
    "however , the tsas is likely contained within the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) which itself only occupies a small fraction of the total line of sight . recall that since 3c  138 is optically visible (  3.2 ) , most of the cnm is comprised of along this line of sight , and thus the aricebo column density likely traces the bulk of the cnm in this direction . if we assume that the average density of the large scale cold is 56 @xmath15 ( i.e. as also assumed by",
    "* based on pressure arguments ) and use the total cold column density toward 3c  138 of @xmath81 @xmath51 (  3.2 ) , then _ all _ of the large size scale cold gas toward 3c  138 only occupies @xmath82 pc along the line of sight ( compared to 500 pc extent of the galactic disk in this direction )",
    ". the line of sight depth of a single velocity component will be even less ( assuming its density is equal to or higher than 56 @xmath15 ) .",
    "since tsas is observed in all of the velocity components with sufficient signal to noise to detect it , it seems reasonable to divide the cnm path length by the number of velocity components ( seven ) . from these numbers",
    "a lower limit to the filling factor of tsas in the cnm along the line of sight to 3c  138 is @xmath83 .",
    "thus , while we emphasize that we can not measure this value directly , a tsas filling factor in the cnm of @xmath84 is plausible .",
    "as described in  1 , contradictory results have been obtained from attempts to probe the galactic tsas with pulsars .",
    "these observations have prompted descriptions of small - scale structure ranging from potentially a relatively `` rare phenomenon ''",
    "@xcite to `` a general property of the [ interstellar medium ] '' @xcite . however , one difficulty with the pulsar observations is that although they have been sampled on timescales similar to that presented in this study toward 3c  138 ( timescales of a couple of years ) , as well as significantly shorter timescales of a few months , they probe only discrete lines of sight . as a simple example , consider a pulsar moving behind a discrete clump . with",
    "`` poorly chosen '' epochs of observation , the pulsar lines of sight could bracket the clump and display little or no change in the optical depth .",
    "our observations cover a continuous range of angular scales from 20 to 300  mas , which includes the scales sampled typically by pulsar observations . since the typical size scale of significant opacity variations toward 3c  138 is @xmath2 mas ( see figures 4 and 5 ) we use this value as the fiducial transverse sample scale",
    ". using this typical separation we can assess the extent to which multi - epoch pulsar observations produce `` typical '' optical depth variations .    a single pulsar `` trial '' is simulated by forming the optical depth difference @xmath73 for two points separated by  50  mas along a cross - cut parallel to the long axis of 3c138 ( see figures  1 and 5 ) .",
    "the angular extent of the long axis is sufficiently long that multiple `` trials '' can be simulated along the cross cut ; the trials are made independent by moving the endpoints at least 20  mas ( 1 beam width ) along the cross cut .",
    "moreover , 3c138 is sufficiently wide along its short axis ( se / nw direction ) that multiple , independent ( i.e. , offset by at least 20  mas from each other ) cross cuts parallel to the long axis can be formed .",
    "finally , we conducted pulsar simulation trials at all three velocities , 0.9 , 6.2 , and  9.0  km s@xmath7 . in total , we were able to simulate 120 pulsar observation trials .",
    "figure  8 shows the resulting histogram of @xmath73 values for all independent pulsar simulations .",
    "it is apparent that the most probable value for  @xmath73 is 0 , but that there is a tail to large values , @xmath85",
    ". based on these limited simulations , we expect that @xmath86 in @xmath87 of pulsar observations .",
    "our simulated results are in reasonable agreement with the recent observational results by @xcite and @xcite who find that few pulsars show measurable @xmath73 changes .",
    "moreover , the rapid temporal variations implied by our data toward 3c  138 will further reduce the probability of detecting variations with pulsar observations .",
    "thus , drawing conclusions from pulsar observations about the fraction of the neutral ism in small - scale structures is difficult due to the low probability that the observing epochs will be exactly matched to the size scale ( and timing ) of an appreciable variation in @xmath73 .",
    "two of the most notable aspects of the absorption toward  is the relatively large amplitude of opacity variations observed and that observed variations have a fairly uniform typical sizescale of 50 mas ( @xmath88 au ) . while opacity variations are observed toward other sources @xcite in many cases , these opacity variations are much smaller in amplitude . to",
    "what extent is the line of sight to  typical of other lines of sight through the ?",
    "table  4 summarizes the absorption observations in the literature that have made use of vlbi imaging .",
    "there is a clear bimodal distribution for the sizes of sources that have been studied , with only  and probing length scales larger than 100  .",
    "in contrast , from figure 5 , it is clear that for the case of the typical size scale for significant changes is @xmath2 mas .",
    "there are of course uncertainties in converting between the observed angular scales and the equivalent linear scales , as in many cases the galactic rotation curve is of limited utility in determining the distance to the absorbing gas .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that only two sources ,  and , are both large enough and have a high enough surface brightness to make the detection of these opacity variations significant .    we conclude that the the large amplitude opacity variations that are observed toward  and are likely to be a selection effect .",
    "much like the case of the pulsar observations (  4.2 ) , the typical equivalent linear scales probed by the lines of sight to most sources are too small to have a large probability of displaying a significant opacity variation .",
    "there are two main explanations for the small scale gas : ( 1 ) the variations are caused by changes in the physical properties of small parcels of gas ; or ( 2 ) the variations are merely the manifestation of random fluctuations contributed by the entire range of spatial scales in the `` red '' power spectrum .    in the past , the main argument against a `` physical entity '' interpretation for the small scale structure has been the difficulty in reconciling the pressure that such `` clumps '' would exert on the surrounding medium . @xcite has attempted to ameliorate the pressure problem by suggesting that the temperature of the small scale features is low compared to the average ism , and that they have a filamentary or sheet like structure , so that the density is also lower than implied by the transverse size .",
    "however , we have shown in  3.2 that there is little difference between the line widths of the vlba spectra and that obtained by @xcite using the arecibo telescope toward 3c  138 . indeed , the vlba line widths are slightly _ wider _ than their arecibo counterparts ( see table 3 ) .",
    "this comparison seems to exclude the possibility that the small scale features have significantly lower temperatures .",
    "for example , @xcite estimate from comparison of the arecibo absorption and emission spectra that the spin temperatures of the four strongest 3c  138 velocity components range from 40 to 55 k. these spin temperatures translate into thermal line widths of 1.3 to 1.6 km s@xmath7 ( using @xmath89 ) .",
    "the difference between the observed line width and the thermal width is presumably due to turbulent motions in the gas .",
    "if the spin temperature dropped to @xmath90 k in the small scale structures as suggested by @xcite , we would expect to see a _",
    "decrease _ in the vlba line widths of @xmath91 to 0.8 km s@xmath7 compared to the arecibo spectrum .",
    "such changes are well within the sensitivity of the gaussian fitting for the strong components , and are not observed .",
    "it is possible that a drop in spin temperature is exactly countered by a large increase in the turbulent width , but this seems unlikely .",
    "thus , the absence of line - width decreases in the vlba data indicates that the dominant cause of the opacity variations is likely to be density fluctuations , possibly accompanied by a small increase ( @xmath92 km s@xmath7 ) in the thermal or turbulent contributions to the line widths .",
    "such an increase in the thermal or turbulent widths would account for the somewhat greater widths of the stronger vlba lines compared to the arecibo data ( table 2 ) .",
    "@xcite have carried out a comprehensive survey of the uv lines of in the directions of 21 early type stars near longitudes of @xmath93 and @xmath94 with distances in the range of 1 to 3.7 kpc .",
    "the lines arise from the three fine - structure levels of the ground electronic state . based on ratios of the two excited levels , it is possible to derive the pressures in the interstellar medium . a small fraction of the sight lines probed by @xcite show evidence for significantly enhanced pressures .",
    "@xcite has summarized these results and suggests that rapid changes in pressure may arise from the cascade of mechanical energy to small scales from larger scales .",
    "the pressure changes occur over time scales much shorter than the time required for thermal equilibrium to be established .",
    "@xcite suggest that one of the motivations for @xcite to attribute the small scale structure to lower temperature sheets or filaments viewed edge - on can be eliminated .",
    "that is , the objection to small scale structures based on excessive h@xmath95 formation and thus excessive extinction can be avoided with time scale considerations ; h@xmath95 molecular formation does not have time to occur .",
    "thus the overpressure problem , which was the main impetus for heiles suggestions , is solved precisely because these structures are not in equilibrium and their lifetime is short .",
    "the volume filling factor of the over pressured ism , as determined from the lines , is a few percent at most ( @xmath96 * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comparable to the low filling factors of enhanced optical depth implied by the low covering fraction of such gas toward 3c  138 ( see  4.1 ) . to summarize ,",
    "only a small fraction of the total mass is located in these fluctuations , which is consistent with various other analysis such as that by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "these density fluctuations are almost certainly far from equilibrium and short - lived .",
    "currently , only @xcite has attempted the difficult task of extending the power spectrum down to size scales relevant to the vlba opacity variations described here .",
    "unfortunately , there are a number of unresolved issues regarding the @xcite extrapolation that call into question its direct applicability to the current observational data .",
    "foremost among these issues is that the observed power spectrum used in the @xcite study ( toward casa ) only covers one decade in spatial scale , while the extrapolation is over four decades of spatial scales .",
    "as also pointed out by @xcite , the extrapolation is very sensitive to the assumed spectral index .",
    "indeed , the casa model with a slope of @xmath97 @xcite predicts peak optical depth variations that are @xmath26 times less than we observe ( 0.5 ) toward 3c  138 .",
    "moreover , @xcite observed significantly different power law indices for the line of sight toward cas  a and one of the two clouds toward cygnus  a , suggesting that the power spectrum may depend on direction ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these observed differences are potentially crucial given that according to @xcite , a change of just 0.1 in the power law spectral index would imply a change in the expected opacity variations on au scales by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "also , if the neutral ism is dominated by filamentary or sheet - like structures ( as one might expect if the density fluctuations are transient features arising from shocks ) , the effective spectrum of the density fluctuations could be significantly different than assumed .",
    "further detailed investigation into these issues on small scales will have to await analysis of the _ observed _ power spectrum toward 3c  138 down to scales of at least 10 au .",
    "it is entirely possible that using the appropriate power spectrum for 3c  138 , the @xcite model could produce results that are in agreement with the level of opacity fluctuations described in this paper .",
    "it is notable that the power law slope determined by @xcite and assumed by @xcite : @xmath98 is quite shallow compared to that expected from pure kolmogorov turbulence of @xmath99 .",
    "recent theoretical work by @xcite suggests that if the velocity , as well as the density structure of the gas are properly taken into account , the kolmogorov slope is modified to shallower values ( between @xmath100 to @xmath101 ) depending on whether velocity or density fluctuations dominate the power spectrum .",
    "the shallowest values correspond to the velocity dominated case .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggest that as the velocity averaging of data is increased , the effect of velocity will be reduced and the slope should steepen . for",
    "observed in emission , @xcite ( in the galaxy ) and @xcite ( in the smc ) do find evidence of this effect , i.e. the power spectrum slope steepens as the velocity averaging of the data is increased .",
    "however , @xcite do not see evidence of this effect in their absorption data .",
    "@xcite also find that the degree of steepening as a function of velocity averaging is much less for the cooler components in their emission line data compared to the hotter gas .",
    "these observational results are in general agreement with @xcite who find that opacity effects can play a role in the resulting power spectrum slope , beyond the effects of velocity or density dominance .",
    "thus , overall it seems likely that all current power spectrum analysis from both emission and absorption data ( including * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are consistent with a modified kolmogorov like turbulence .",
    "the fundamental difference between the jenkins and deshpande pictures is that the latter ascribes the small scale fluctuations to `` red '' noise ( noise that increases at larger spatial scales ) in the power spectrum with contributions from _ all _ spatial scales ( i.e. optical depth changes are statistical and not due to physical changes in the gas ) , while the former suggests that a cascade of mechanical energy creates short lived small physical regions with high pressures .",
    "our detections of 2-d optical depth enhancements or `` clumps '' ( see figs . 4 , 5 for example ) makes the deshpande picture seem less likely .",
    "note that this argument would be stronger , even definitive if the clumps with typical sizes of @xmath2 mas were more significantly larger than the beam size of 20 mas .",
    "future , higher resolution observations and simulations may help to resolve this issue .",
    "currently , a paradigm based on a kolmogorov like turbulent or mechanical cascade which produces regions of enhanced pressure does seem favorable based on the recent theoretical and optical work , in addition to our new optical depth data , although it is quite possible that both phenomena contribute to the observed opacity differences .",

    "obviously it is impossible with only three epochs of data separated in time by a few years to answer this question . from figure 5 , it is clear that the small scale structures certainly do change on timescales of @xmath119 years .",

    "<S> several recent studies of galactic absorption toward background quasars and pulsars have provided evidence that there are opacity changes in the neutral galactic interstellar medium on size scales as small as a few au . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of these opacity variations has remained a matter of debate , but could reflect a variety of physical processes , including changes in the spin temperature or gas density . </S>",
    "<S> we present three epochs of vlba observations of galactic absorption toward the quasar 3c  138 with resolutions of 20 mas ( @xmath0 au ) . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis includes vlba data from observations in 1999 and 2002 along with a reexamination of the 1995 vlba data , reported by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> improved data reduction and imaging techniques have led to an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to previous work . with these new data </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the previously detected milliarcsecond scale spatial variations in the opacity at the level of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the typical size scale of the optical depth variations is @xmath2 mas or 25 au . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , for the first time we see clear evidence for temporal variations in the opacity over the seven year time span of our three epochs of data . </S>",
    "<S> we also attempted to detect the magnetic field strength in the gas using the zeeman effect . from this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we have been able to place a 3 @xmath3  upper limit on the magnetic field strength per pixel of @xmath4 g . </S>",
    "<S> we have also been able to calculate for the first time the plane of sky covering fraction of the small scale gas of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this small covering fraction suggests that the filling factor of such gas is quite low in agreement with recent optical observations . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the line widths of the milliarcsecond sizescale features are comparable to those determined from previous single dish measurements toward 3c  138 , suggesting that the opacity variations can not be due to changes in the spin temperature . from these results </S>",
    "<S> we favor a density enhancement interpretation for the small scale structures , although these enhancements appear to be of short duration and are unlikely to be in equilibrium . </S>"
