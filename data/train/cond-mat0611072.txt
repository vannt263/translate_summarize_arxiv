    "the computational effort required to simulate the one - component model is relatively modest and actually diminishes with increasing macroion valence and concentration , as decreasing the screening length shortens the range of effective pair interactions .",
    "the one - component model thus offers insight into bulk phase behavior in parameter regimes that may be computationally prohibitive for more explicit models .",

    "the resulting phase diagrams exhibit coexistence of macroion - rich and macroion - poor fluid phases in excellent agreement with previous predictions and qualitatively consistent with observed thermodynamic anomalies .",
    "the phase instability predicted by theory , and now confirmed by simulations of the same model , occurs in a parameter regime that appears to border the threshold for saturation of the effective macroion charge .",
    "future work will address this open issue by incorporating charge renormalization into the one - component model  @xcite .",
