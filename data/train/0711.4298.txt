    "whenever the energies of two discrete quantum states cross when plotted against some parameter , e.g. time , the transition probability is traditionally estimated by the famous landau - zener ( lz ) formula @xcite .",

    "linearly changing energies and a constant interaction of infinite duration , when applied to real physical systems with more sophisticated time dependences the lz model often provides more accurate results than expected .",
    "this feature ( which has not been fully understood yet ) , and the extreme simplicity of the lz transition probability , have determined the vast popularity of the lz model , despite the availability of more sophisticated exactly soluble level - crossing models , e.g. the demkov - kunike model @xcite and its special case , the allen - eberly - hioe model @xcite .",

    "the other four probabilities @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 exhibit oscillations , in agreement with the analytic prediction , due to the existence of two alternative paths of different length from the initial to the final state ( see fig .",

    "it is noteworthy that these oscillations , due to path interference , are not particularly pronounced , which might be a little surprising at first glance .",

    "the change @xmath141 is equivalent to the exchange of the indices 1 and 3 .",
    "the observed additional symmetry , @xmath142 and @xmath143 , is a consequence from the assumptions of equal rabi frequencies and equal ( in magnitude ) slopes of the energies of states @xmath26 and @xmath30 .",
    "the figure also shows that , with the exception of the survival probabilities @xmath137 @xmath144 , all other probabilities are asymmetric vs the chirp rate @xmath24 , unlike the two - state level - crossing case . for @xmath105 , as for @xmath104 in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] , a varying control parameter changes , besides the relative phase of the interfering paths , also the probabilities @xmath131 and @xmath132 , which eventually acquire their asymptotic values of 0 or 1 ; in these limits the oscillations vanish .",

    "we have developed an approximate analytical model that describes the time - dependent dynamics of a quantum system with three states , which have linearly changing energies of different slopes and are coupled with pulse - shaped interactions .",
    "our approach is based upon the two - state lz model , i.e. we assume independent pairwise transitions between neighboring states , described by the lz model .",
    "we have performed detailed comparison of our analytic approximation with numerical simulations , versus all possible interaction parameters and for all nine transition probabilities , which has revealed a remarkable accuracy , not only in smooth features , but also in describing detailed interference features .",
    "this accuracy shows that indeed , the physical mechanism of the three - state dynamics is dominated by separated pairwise lz transitions , even when the crossings are too close to each other .",
    "we have derived the _ formal _ conditions of validity of our lz approach , eqs . , using the concept of transition time . however , a comparison with numeric simulations has revealed that our approximation is valid well beyond the formal ranges of validity .",
    "one of the reasons is that for two of the survival probabilities , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , our lz approximation produces the exact results .",
    "we have found that even in the extreme case of vanishing static detuning , where our approach _ should not be valid _ because the three crossings coalesce into a triply degenerate bowtie single crossing , it still produces remarkably accurate results because of nearly correct asymptotic behaviors of the transition probabilities .",
    "one of the useful and interesting features of the `` triangle '' linkage pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) is the presence of intrinsic interference effects .",
    "our `` sandwich '' approach , with its implementation in the adiabatic interaction representation , allows for an easy incorporation of different evolution paths in hilbert space between a particular pair of states .",
    "path interferences _ are identified in only four of the nine probabilities .",
    "another source of interferences could be nonadiabatic transitions in the wings of the gaussian pulses , where the nonadiabatic couplings possess local maxima ; these interferences would be visible in all nine probabilities .",
    "we have found , however , that only the path interferences are clearly identified .    a substantial contribution to the path interferences",
    "is played by the lz phases @xmath177 . the lz phase is often neglected in applications of the lz model to multiple crossings , in the so - called `` independent crossing '' approximation , where only probabilities are accounted for .",
    "although such an approach occasionally works , miraculously , as in the exactly soluble demkov - osherov @xcite and demkov - ostrovsky @xcite models , the present simple , but very instructive model , demonstrates that in general , the lz phase , as well the dynamical adiabatic phases , has to be properly accounted for , which is achieved best in an evolution - matrix approach , preferably in the adiabatic - interaction representation @xcite .    in order to be closer to experimental reality ,",
    "in the examples we have assumed pulsed interactions , specifically of gaussian time dependence .",
    "this proved to be no hindrance for the accuracy of the model , which is remarkable because we have applied the lz model ( which presumes constant couplings ) at crossings ( the first and the last ones ) situated at the wings of the gaussian - shaped couplings where the latter change rapidly .",
    "this robustness of the approach can be traced to the use of the adiabatic basis where the pulse - shape details are accounted for in the adiabatic phases .",
    "we have used the analytic results to derive some useful features of the dynamics , for instance , we have found explicitly the parameter values for which certain probabilities reach the 50% level , and for which a maximally coherent superposition is created of all three states @xmath159 .    in the specific derivations we have assumed for the sake of simplicity equal couplings for the two transitions and slopes of different signs but equal magnitudes for two of the energies .",
    "these assumptions simplify considerably the ensuing expressions for the probabilities ; moreover , they are actually present in some important applications ( quantum rotors , zeeman sublevels in magnetic field and spin - spin entanglement ) . the formalism is readily extended to the general case , of unequal couplings and different slopes , and we have verified that the resulting lz - based approximation is very accurate again .",
    "to conclude , the present work demonstrates that , once again , the lz model outperforms expectations when applied to multistate dynamics , with multiple level crossings and a multitude of evolution paths .",
