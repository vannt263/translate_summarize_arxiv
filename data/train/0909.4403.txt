    "numerical simulations of non - linear structure formation in a broad class of cosmological models , even with different types of power spectra for the dark - matter ( dm hereafter ) density fluctuations , reveal a typical shape for the density profile of dm haloes . as far as the numerical resolution allows this statement , the density profile begins with at least a mild singularity in the core , then falls off with a relatively flat slope out to a characteristic radius where it gently steepens towards an asymptotic behaviour @xmath5 far away from the core .",
    "do real haloes behave in the same way as theory predicts ?",
    "gravitational lensing should in principle be able to give the cleanest answer to this question .",
    "density profiles in galaxy - sized objects are expected to be modified on small scales by baryonic physics , where they are likely to approach the isothermal density slope @xmath6 instead of the generic dm behaviour . on the mass scale of galaxy groups or clusters ,",
    "however , baryonic physics should be constrained to the innermost region , leaving the dm density profile almost intact .",
    "galaxy - galaxy lensing seems to show tentative evidence for this expectation @xcite : while the shear profile around low - mass haloes is consistent with an isothermal density profile , it seems to flatten towards the theoretical expectation for dm haloes around high - mass haloes .",
    "the question is important because it aims at a central prediction of non - linear cosmological structure formation .",
    "answering it is complicated by the angular resolution limit of @xmath7 of weak gravitational lensing , set by the number density of background galaxies , and by the high non - linearity of strong gravitational lensing .",
    "in fact , claims that strong gravitational lensing , when combined with stellar dynamics , requires flat halo cores have been made @xcite and doubted",
    ". in particular @xcite showed how the measurement of the inner slope can be systematically underestimated if halo s substructure are not taken into account .",
    "a weak lensing analysis , even if observationally more challenging , has the advantage to be almost insensitive to cluster s substructures because of the instrinsic nature of the signal .",
    "previous studies based on weak lensing have followed an approach where a shear profile was first measured and then fit to the shear profile expected from certain three - dimensional density profiles , thus indirectly constraining the density - profile models . given the sparseness of lensing information near the core of galaxy groups and clusters ,",
    "we develop a different approach here . instead of constraining the shear profile ,",
    "we only wish to derive a single number from the shear data , namely the slope @xmath0 of the density profile within the characteristic radius , assuming that the asymptotic outer slope is @xmath8 .",
    "we pursue this approach with two linear filtering techniques .",
    "one of them is specifically constructed below to return @xmath0 as its only result .",
    "it is thus made to combine all available information into its estimate and should thus optimise the significance of the measurement .",
    "the other varies the inner slope of the density profile until it finds the maximum signal - to - noise ratio in a given sample of haloes .",
    "we proceed as follows . in sect .  2",
    ", we introduce the weak - lensing properties of the generalised nfw density profile .",
    "we develop our linear filters in sect .",
    ", we also discuss the degeneracy between the central density slope and the concentration parameter of the halo and use the fisher matrix to find a linear parameter combination which is best constrained by shear measurements .",
    "the sensitivity of our method and its limitations are shown and discussed in sects .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "section  6 presents our conclusions .",
    "in the last decade a large effort has been devoted to predict the density profile of dm haloes in @xmath9 cosmologies .",
    "thanks to increasing resolution of numerical simulations there is now a common agreement @xcite , that dm density profiles can be accurately described by the generalized nfw profile @xmath10 with the scale radius @xmath11 , the inner slope @xmath0 and the scale density @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a hypergeometric function and @xmath14 is the radius enclosing 200 times the critical density of the universe @xmath15 .",
    "the halo concentration is defined as @xmath16 following @xcite we interpret the scale radius as the radius where the density profile reaches slope @xmath17 , i.e.  @xmath18 . for the profile of equation [ eq : nfwgen ] @xmath19 and thus @xmath20 for @xmath21",
    "this formula reduces to the standard nfw case @xcite .",
    "the profile is fully characterized when the mass , the redshift , the concentration and the inner slope of the halo are specified .",
    "however not all of these parameters are independent .",
    "numerical simulations show that it is possible to define fitting formulae relating the concentration with the mass and the redshift of the halo . in the following",
    "we will use the prescription proposed by @xcite for this purpose .",
    "they also found that for a fixed value of mass and redshift , the concentration approximately follows a log - normal distribution @xmath22d\\ln c \\;\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the 1-@xmath24 deviation of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this section summarises the basic weak - lensing concepts that will be used later . for a complete overview",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "an isolated lens with surface mass density @xmath26 has the lensing potential @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gravitational constant , @xmath2 is the speed of light , and @xmath29 are the angular diameter distances between the observer and the lens , the observer and the source and the lens and the source respectively .    due to the presence of the lens a light ray",
    "is deflected by the angle @xmath30 a source located at the angular position @xmath31 in the sky is seen by the observer at an angular position @xmath32 which are related by the lens equation @xmath33 if the source s angular extent is much smaller than the angular scale on which the lens properties change , the lens mapping can be locally linearised and the image distortion is given by the following jacobian matrix @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the _ convergence _",
    ", i.e.  the surface mass density scaled by the _ critical surface mass density _ @xmath36 and @xmath37[eq : shearcomp ] are the two components of the complex shear @xmath38 .",
    "the net result is a distortion and a magnification of the background sources due to the lens gravitational field .",
    "for an axially - symmetric lens , outside critical curves , the distortion is tangential to the line connecting the source and the lens so that the tangential shear is given by @xmath39[eq : tanshear ] and the shear modulus can be derived from the convergence , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the mean surface mass density inside a circle of radius @xmath42 centered on the lens and @xmath43 is the convergence at radius @xmath42 . if @xmath44 it is not possible to find an analytic expression for the shear profile and therefore equation [ eq : gamma_sym ] has to be computed numerically .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : genshear ] the shear profile for three values of @xmath0 ( 0.5,1.0,1.5 ) .",
    "the inner shear profile depends sensitively on the inner slope @xmath0 . in the case",
    "@xmath45 the shear is logarithmically divergent for small values of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the divergence is more pronounced for steeper profiles , while the shear profile decreases for @xmath46 and tends to converge to a finite value even if it is undefined for @xmath47 .",
    "the shear profile depends on the two parameters of the density profile , of which the concentration depends mildly on the halo redshift .",
    "an additional and stronger dependence on halo and source redshifts is introduced through the geometry of the lens system .",
    "the observable lensing signal is the ellipticity of the background galaxies , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is their intrinsic ellipticity , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the major and minor axes , respectively , @xmath52 is the orientation angle , @xmath53 is the _ reduced shear _ @xmath54 and @xmath55 is its complex conjugate . in the weak - lensing regime ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 . in the following , we will exclusively use the reduced shear since we want to explore scales where the approximation @xmath58 does not hold .",
    "nonetheless , we shall denote it by @xmath59 throughout for simplicity of notation .",
    "in this section we describe two methods , based on optimal linear filters @xcite , to estimate the inner slope of dm haloes using weak - lensing observations .",
    "the advantage of linear filtering as opposed to standard profile fitting is that filters can be constructed such as to minimise noise caused by intervening structures along the line - of - sight .      for a generic optimal linear filter",
    ", the data @xmath60 is modelled as the sum of the signal to be measured and the noise @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the signal amplitude and @xmath64 is a model for its angular shape . in our application ,",
    "the signal is the lensing shear of the intervening dm halo and the noise is given by the intrinsic ellipticity of the background galaxies , their finite number and the contamination due to large - scale structures .",
    "the noise components are assumed to be gaussian , random with zero mean and isotropic since their statistical properties are independent of the position in the sky ( for further detail see @xcite ) .",
    "we now define a linear filter @xmath65 which , when convolved with the data , yields an estimate for the amplitude of the signal at the position @xmath32 : @xmath66 which is unbiased @xmath67=0 \\,\\label{bias_fltr}\\ ] ] and whose variance @xmath68 @xmath69 , \\label{var_flt}\\ ] ] is minimal .",
    "the filter @xmath70 satisfying these two conditions minimises the lagrangian @xmath71 .",
    "it reads @xmath72 ^ 2 \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}({\\bmath{k}},\\alpha,{\\bmath{w}})}{p_{n}(k)}.\\label{eq : fltr}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the fourier transforms of the filter and the signal shape , respectively .",
    "note that we have assumed in the previous derivation that the mean values of the halo parameters ( @xmath76 ) are well known .",
    "this is an idealising assumption and we refer to sect .",
    "[ sec : mod_sens ] for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the filter depends only on the angular shape of the signal @xmath77 and the noise power spectrum @xmath78 .",
    "in particular it is most sensitive to those spatial frequencies for which the signal @xmath79 is large and the noise power spectrum is small .",
    "this filter is optimal in the sense that it maximises the signal - to - noise ratio for the a given assumed signal shape .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : filter_shape ] shows the filter s shape calculated using three different values of the inner slope , @xmath80 .",
    "cc      the filter described in the previous section can be used to measure quantities which appear linearly in eq .",
    "[ eq : data ] ( e.g.  the amplitude of the shear signal ) .",
    "this is not the case for the inner slope @xmath0 breaking the main assumption on which the linear filter is based on .",
    "however , if we expand the halo s shear profile around a fiducial value of the inner slope , @xmath81 , @xmath82 eq .",
    "[ eq : data ] reads @xmath83 such that @xmath84 appears linearly and the linear filtering scheme can be applied .",
    "the shear derivative with respect to @xmath0 plays the role of the signal shape , @xmath79 , and @xmath84 that of the amplitude @xmath63 to be measured .",
    "this allows the definition of the following estimator for the inner slope , @xmath85[eq : p1_aest ] where @xmath86    the approximation applied in eq .",
    "[ eq : linder ] implies that @xmath87 is a good estimator of the inner slope only when @xmath81 is close to the real value of @xmath0 .",
    "if this is not the case , the value of the inner slope tends to be overestimated as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : lin_alpha ] .",
    "if a single halo is considered , the error bars associated to @xmath88 are so large that the overestimation can be neglected for a large range of @xmath89 . however ,",
    "if several haloes are stacked , the error bars shrink and the overestimation becomes important . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "more measurements of the same halo have to be carried out sequentially : the first measurement starting with an arbitrary value of @xmath81 , and the second using the estimate @xmath87 found previously as a fiducial value .",
    "we tested that , for a reasonable guess of the first fiducial value , 2 - 3 measurements suffice to recover the correct slope .",
    "the linear expansion used in the previous section can be avoided by defining a scale - adaptive filter .",
    "such a filter is defined similarly as the linear filter from sect .",
    "[ sec : lf ] with an additional constraint on the amplitude of the signal @xmath90 which must be maximised when the adopted inner slope fits the data best , @xmath91 the minimisation of @xmath92 leads to the filter @xmath93 \\ , \\label{matched_fltr}\\ ] ] with the constants @xmath94",
    "@xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97    its defining property is thus to maximise the signal - to - noise ratio when the correct inner slope is adopted .",
    "this implies that the inner slope can only be determined indirectly from a sequence of measurements of the shear amplitude @xmath90 , searching for that value of @xmath0 that maximises @xmath90 .",
    "the filter shape is plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : filter_shape ] .      the two methods presented in sects .",
    "[ sec : lf ] and [ sec : sa ] assume a cluster model with known mass , redshift and concentration .",
    "in a realistic situation , we can assume to have sufficiently precise redshifts .",
    "mass estimates would have to be obtained from optical richness , kinematics of the cluster galaxies or x - ray scaling relations .",
    "then , estimates for the concentration could be derived from the mass - concentration relation found in numerical simulations , albeit with a considerable scatter .",
    "the concentration depends only very weakly on the mass , hence uncertainties in the mass estimate do not strongly affect the concentration estimate , and thus the mass does not need to be precisely known . however , numerical simulations suggest a log - normal distribution of the concentration around its mean with a standard deviation of @xmath98 , which implies that concentration parameters of real clusters can only be very poorly guessed .    moreover",
    ", the inner slope , as the parameter we are aiming to measure , is degenerate with the concentration .",
    "in fact , it is possible to describe a halo with high central density with a large value of @xmath0 and a small value of @xmath2 or vice versa , and so the problem is not well defined @xcite .",
    "thus , any attempt at measuring the profile s inner slope depends critically on the assumed halo concentration , which is uncertain in reality .    to cope with this problem , it is convenient to re - parametrise the profile accounting for this model degeneracy , defining new parameters which can be more precisely measured . in short ,",
    "the logic behind the procedure described below is as follows . in a realistic situation , we have no chance to break the degeneracy between @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "rather , we can rotate the parameter space such that one of its axes becomes parallel to the degeneracy direction and the other perpendicular to it .",
    "the latter will define a new parameter as a linear combination of @xmath2 and @xmath0 which observations can constrain best . comparisons with theory should then be performed on the basis of this parameter rather than through @xmath2 and @xmath0 separately .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "starting from the question how the central density profiles of group or cluster - sized , dm haloes can best be constrained and compared to observations , we have developed two methods based on linear filtering of gravitational - shear data that aim at returning a single number , i.e.  an estimate of the inner slope @xmath0 of density profile .",
    "one filter is constructed to directly return this number , the other searches for the maximum of the signal - to - noise ratio as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "our results are as follows :    * when applied to a single halo of @xmath99 near @xmath100 , the inner slope of the density profile can be estimated with a 1-@xmath24 accuracy of @xmath101 with the linear filter and @xmath102 with the scale - adaptive filter , provided the halo concentration is known .",
    "even though this situation is unrealistically idealised , it is promising because it is based on a single halo only . *",
    "taking the considerable uncertainty in halo concentrations into account increases the 1-@xmath24 error to between @xmath103 . * in reality",
    ", the halo concentration is at best roughly known .",
    "based on real data , there is an almost perfect degeneracy between @xmath0 and the halo - concentration parameter @xmath2 : if @xmath2 is assumed to be too large , @xmath0 will be underestimated and vice versa . based on lensing data only",
    ", this degeneracy can not be lifted . * to address this problem , we search for that combination of the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath2 that can best be constrained by observations .",
    "we set up the fisher matrix , rotate the two - dimensional parameter space to diagonalise it and identify its smaller eigenvalue as that best - constrained parameter , called @xmath4 .",
    "we find @xmath104 for the linear filter and @xmath105 for the scale - adaptive filter . *",
    "this parameter @xmath4 is now constrained with a 1-@xmath24 relative accuracy of @xmath106 both with the linear and the scale - adaptive filters and the measurement is almost insensitive to the value of the other parameter @xmath107 .",
    "while these results seem highly promising , in particular when applications to cluster samples rather than individual clusters are envisaged , we consider our study as a first step .",
    "while we have taken into account that image ellipticities measure the reduced gravitational shear rather than the shear itself , measuring the reduced shear near the centres of galaxy groups or clusters is severely hampered by the cluster galaxies themselves .",
    "it thus appears necessary to stack the signal from several or many clusters to arrive at a reliable estimate for @xmath0 .",
    "then , clusters with different masses , redshifts and concentration parameters will inevitably be combined , with the tendency to blur the signal . however , the results derived and presented above indicate that the principle of our approach is promising , which consists in combining all available information into a single number , which is thus well constrained .",
    "further studies are required to address the issue of stacking data in this context .",
