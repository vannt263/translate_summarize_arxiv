    "computing is an emerging field of research in which the rules of quantum physics are used to solve certain computing problems more efficiently than any classical algorithm @xcite .",
    "a quantum circuit is employed to process quantum bits ( qubit ) , where a qubit is the unit of quantum information .",
    "it can be typically realized as a particular spin state of an electron , or a certain polarization state of a photon . while the two possible spin states of an electron are @xmath0 @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xmath3 , the two polarization states of a photon are @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "such states are denoted by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "a qubit can also represent any superposition state @xmath10 = @xmath11 + @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the standard dirac notation @xcite for quantum states , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the complex amplitudes representing the probabilities of state @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively satisfying the condition @xmath16 .",
    "although a single qubit can theoretically be in infinite number of superposed states corresponding to all possible pair of values for the amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath15 , in reality equal amplitudes for the two basis states lead to the observation that @xmath17 qubits can represent at most @xmath18 possible superposed states",
    "n_-qubit quantum state can be represented as _ @xmath19 _ , where _ i _ is written in binary representation and @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to the concept of a quantum register @xcite with _ n _ qubits holding @xmath18 simultaneous values .",
    "massive parallelism in quantum computing can occur if an operation is performed on the contents of a register , all possible values are operated on simultaneously . in practice",
    "however , the property of quantum de - coherence @xcite has to be tackled in order to achieve this sort of parallelism .",
    "quantum circuits or gate networks realizing boolean functions are termed as quantum boolean circuits ( qbcs ) .",
    "formally , a qbc is a quantum system of _ n _ qubits specified by @xmath21 , and a number of reversible quantum gates .",
    "the quantum gates such as not , controlled - not ( cnot ) , swap , which implement specific unitary operations manifest the logic operations .    younnes and miller",
    "@xcite raised the issue that only the interaction ( coupling ) between physically adjacent qubits is desired for practical implementation of quantum boolean circuits ( qbcs ) .",
    "this is termed as the _ linear nearest - neighbor ( lnn ) _ configuration .",
    "the requirement of nearest neighbor relationship between the control and the target qubits is truly justified due to the limitation of the j - coupling force @xcite required to perform multi - qubit logic operations and this works effectively only between the adjacent qubits . in a qbc , pairs of swap gates play a key role in bringing the control and the target qubits of any quantum gate to adjacent lines . but",
    "this increases the gate cost .",
    "hence , the aim in lnn synthesis of minimizing the number of additional swap gates has been addressed in this paper .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "the next section is a review of existing synthesis approaches including methods for cost reduction . in section iii , the proposed lnn synthesis approach and related convention for multi - controlled gate decompositions are discussed . in section iv , the graph partitioning based lnn synthesis method is presented .",
    "experimental results appear next and concluding remarks in section vi .",
    "one of the major challenges in hardware implementation by any technology is to minimize power dissipation .",
    "landauer @xcite showed that irreversible circuits must dissipate certain energy irrespective of the technology used .",
    "bennett @xcite in his work clearly established that the most effective way of implementing reversible circuits to avoid this situation is to employ quantum technology .",
    "furthermore , using quantum technology certain computational tasks can be performed exponentially faster @xcite than by the hardware of existing irreversible technologies .    in the implementation of quantum circuits , optimization of circuit levels",
    "as well gate count in a quantum boolean network needs to be done . for a small circuit , this can be done easily , but for the larger ones , we need to find a proper algorithmic approach for minimizing quantum cost in the circuit . here",
    ", quantum cost means the cost in implementing a given quantum circuit using a suitable technology .",
    "synthesis of quantum boolean network is an emerging research area and some fine works @xcite have been done on reversible circuit synthesis in recent years .",
    "local optimization methods have been proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "other models on reversible logic synthesis have also been proposed by many authors @xcite .",
    "but from a practical viewpoint there are other drawbacks with these approaches .",
    "each gate must be realized in a linear nearest neighbor architecture .",
    "@xcite have discussed in detail about the cost metrics and the need for lnn optimization .",
    "@xcite discusses the schemes for permuting the qubits for achieving the lnn configuration .",
    "it carries out the optimization in the number of swap gates by carrying out the search for each gate individually , a sort of local ordering .",
    "it is not shown how this can lead to the optimization in the number of swap gates considering the whole circuit .",
    "related works can also be found in @xcite .",
    "most of these methods are built for linear nearest neighbor ( lnn ) architecture where only adjacent qubits can interact . in most of the articles ,",
    "the authors aim at minimizing nearest neighbor cost to achieve nnc optimality .",
    "@xcite showed that achieving nnc optimality by introducing additional swap gates increases quantum cost .",
    "they aim optimality by decomposing a toffoli gate to basic gates , e.g , not , cnot , controlled - v and controlled - v^+^ and then reordered the circuit lines by means of local and global reordering . this results in nnc optimality and reduced quantum cost .",
    "maslov @xcite presents a theoretical study on quantum circuit placement in physical hardware by means of a graph theoretic approach .",
    "a toffoli network synthesis using template matching has also been proposed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new approach for inserting pairs of swap gates , and reordering the qubit lines based on a graph partitioning approach .",
    "this gives better results compared to those by the earlier ones including @xcite .",
    "our work is based on reordering the qubit lines so that the interacting qubits are adjacent to each other , i.e. , the distance between target and control lines are minimized ( this is termed as nearest neighbor cost ( nnc ) in @xcite ) . without loss of generality , it may be assumed that a given qbc is not in nearest neighbor form .",
    "swap gates are inserted appropirately to convert the qbc to a corresponding lnn architecture . it may be noted that for 1-qubit and 2-qubit gates , lnn architecture can be obtained without any additional swap gates .",
    "hence , the multi - qubit gates need special attention in lnn synthesis to reduce the number of extra swap gates required ,    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , a toffoli or @xmath22not quantum gate is shown which is not in the nearest neighbor architecture .",
    "insertion of swap gates for lnn without reordering the qubit lines is shown to be non - optimal in fig .",
    "1(b ) , whereas the optimal synthesis after reordering as in fig .",
    "1(c ) requires no swap gates .        in this example of fig . 1",
    ", we have considered a single gate where the reordering can be done easily . the pertinent question is how to solve this for large benchmark qbc circuits with many qubit lines .",
    "furthermore , an optimal solution with minimum nnc is the desideratum .    for ease of handling , we further sub - divide the lnn synthesis problem for qbcs as one for not , cnot and toffoli ( nct ) and another for multiple controlled toffoli ( mct ) gates . in the next two subsections we discuss these two types of synthesis separately .      for the realization of quantum circuits in hardware technology we have to introduce swap gates or a chain of basic quantum gates in the circuit to make it a lnn circuit . for introducing swap gates in a toffoli network to make a lnn architecture , an algorithm for counting the required swap gate pairs",
    "is introduced here .    for a simple not gate ,",
    "the number of swap pair required is zero . for a cnot gate ,",
    "the number of swap pairs is simply the number of intermediate qubit lines between top and bottom control lines .",
    "there may be two variations of a cnot gate as shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) .        for a toffoli gate",
    "the scenario is somewhat complex .",
    "there may be three variations of a toffoli gate corresponding to the positions of its target qubit .",
    "all the variations of cnot and toffoli are shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , ( d ) , ( e ) .",
    "we now formally present the rule for counting the additional swap gates needed to convert a non - lnn gate to the corresponding lnn .",
    "let @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 denote the two control qubit lines and the target output qubit line of a toffoli gate .",
    "the input qubit lines have consecutive integer indices starting with @xmath26 for the topmost qubit line .",
    "the control qubit line having lower index value is denoted by @xmath23 and the other control qubit line by @xmath24 .",
    "* rules for counting swap pairs *    * case 1 : * = @xmath27 + = * if * @xmath28 , then required swap pair is + = @xmath29 where @xmath30 and + = @xmath31 + = * else if * @xmath32 , then required swap pair + = is @xmath33 where @xmath34 + * case 2 : * = @xmath35 + = * if * @xmath36 , then required swap pair is + = @xmath33 where @xmath37 , otherwise no + = swap pair is needed + = * if * @xmath38 , then required swap pair is + = @xmath33 where @xmath39 , otherwise no + = swap pair is needed + * case 3 : * = @xmath40 + = * if * @xmath41 , then required swap pair is + = @xmath29 where @xmath42 and + = @xmath43 + = * else if * @xmath32 , then required swap pair + = is @xmath33 where @xmath34 +      another side of the problem is to decompose each mct gate in the reversible circuit into an equivalent nct network .",
    "after then the nearest neighbor synthesis is to be done for the entire circuit . consider the mct gate in fig .",
    "3 .    , @xmath44,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    here , the original circuit is a multiple controlled toffoli .",
    "using standard decomposition @xcite the gate is converted to equivalent toffoli . as a result , gate count and quantum cost has increased .",
    "two extra ancillary qubits have come into the scenario and the circuit is not in nearest neighbor condition .    as far as we are focussing the hardware implementation of quantum circuits , the decomposition of an arbitrary circuit ( multiple controlled toffoli ) is necessary .",
    "@xcite states the necessity of decomposition and introduction of ancillary qubits .",
    "@xcite showed some decomposition leading to increased quantum cost by adding swap gates whenever a non - adjacent quantum gate appears .",
    "in our approach we have taken circuit files from _ revlib _ @xcite and written a c program to parse it into an equivalent toffoli network .",
    "it can be shown that for decomposition of a single @xmath22not gate , the number of toffoli required is @xmath45 and number of ancillary qubits required is @xmath46 @xcite . using this formula",
    "we have simply reconstructed the decomposed circuit .",
    "the resultant circuit contains only not , cnot and toffoli gates .",
    "in this section , we propose a graph partitioning based approach to get the ordering of qubit lines to achieve lnn architecture .",
    "any non - lnn circuit can be converted to lnn one by introducing additional swap gates .",
    "but the linear ordering of the qubit lines will make the difference in number of swap gates required in making the lnn circuit . on a practical quantum computer ,",
    "a number of swap operations is necessary to emulate the behavior of a quantum circuit running on an ideal machine @xcite .",
    "some works on toffoli network synthesis can be found in @xcite .",
    "some authors focused on logic synthesis by permutation of qubit lines @xcite also . very recently",
    "lnn synthesis by means of line reordering has presented by saeedi _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "however , in this section we propose a balanced graph partitioning approach through which reordering can be achieved with less overhead producing better result than the existing ones . although graph partitioning problem is np - complete , many algorithms exist that result a reasonably good partition .",
    "we first formulate the graph partitioning problem mathematically and then introduce the method how we have exploited the problem in nn synthesis .",
    "we define an undirected weighted _ qubit line adjacency graph _",
    "@xmath47 for a given qbc @xmath48 where each vertex @xmath49 represents an input qubit line .",
    "there is an edge between two vertices @xmath50 and @xmath49 if the corresponding qubit lines appear as the control and target qubit lines of a single gate in @xmath48 .",
    "thus , for a not gate there is no edge ; for a cnot gate there is an edge between its control and target qubit lines ; for a toffoli@xmath51 gate there are two edges namely ( @xmath23,@xmath25 ) and ( @xmath52 ) . the weight @xmath53 of an edge @xmath54 between the vertices @xmath50 and @xmath49 is the number of times the pair of qubit lines corresponding to @xmath50 and @xmath49 appear as the control and target qubit of any quantum gate in the given qbc . it may noted that for a qbc with a single output , this graph is connected .",
    "4 illustrates a qbc of nct gate library and its qubit line adjacency graph .",
    "we have used _ pmetis _",
    "@xcite graph partitioning tool for partitioning .",
    "this tool is developed using multilevel partitioning algorithm ( coarsening , partitioning and uncoarsening phases ) and produce good quality of partition with less execution time .",
    "the complexity of the algorithm used in _ pmetis",
    "_ is approximately @xmath58 where @xmath17 is the number of nodes , @xmath59 is the number of edges and @xmath60 is the number of partitions .",
    "we have written a c program to parse the circuit description of a toffoli network to the graph description format required for _ pmetis _ input .",
    "the output is a linear ordering of the partitions that are returned by _",
    "pmetis_. but in most of the cases the ordering returned by _ pmetis",
    "_ there are fewer non - empty partitions than the required number of partitions .",
    "hence , more than one vertices may present in a single partition . to resolve this problem ,",
    "we have made a linear ordering of the partition order .",
    "for example , if the input qubit lines are 0 through 5 and the partitioning order is : @xmath61 , we will reorder these as : @xmath62 .        from the reordered qubit lines we have again reconstructed the nct network .",
    "then the required number of swap pair is calculated in both cases using the rule presented in the previous section .",
    "figure 5 demonstrates the synthesis of the circuit _",
    "4mod5-bdd_287 _ from _ revlib_. the original circuit is represented in fig.5(a ) , which is not in nn architecture .",
    "the number of swap gates required to make this circuit lnn is 15 .",
    "fig.5(b ) is the graph formed from reordered circuit in ( d ) and 5(c ) are the partition numbers returned by _",
    "pmetis _ after the partitioning .",
    "fig.5(d ) is the reconstructed circuit after the reordering , which clearly shows that number of swap gate requirement has come down to @xmath63 to make it an lnn circuit .",
    "the experimental results are shown in table .",
    "the first column is the list of benchmark circuits used in our experiment , next three columns are the number of qubit lines ( n ) , gate count ( gc ) and quantum cost ( qc ) in the original circuit .",
    "swap cost and total quantum cost ( qc ) of the decomposed circuit before ordering are shown in the next two columns , followed by swap cost and qc after ordering .",
    "then the percentage reduction of quantum cost after reordering the qubit lines are shown .",
    "next column denotes the results reported by wille _",
    "the percentage decrease in quantum cost over @xcite is shown in the last column .    regarding the quantum cost of various gates , cost of not , cnot and swap gates",
    "are taken as @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively @xcite .",
    "when two qubits of a particular gate are adjacent , then there is no need to introduce swap between them , when two qubit lines are adjacent then only the notion of introducing swap gates comes into the scenario .",
    "we have taken 54 benchmark circuits from _ revlib _ , out of which the results for 20 circuits are also reported in @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that using our method we can reduce the number of swap gates and therefore the total quantum cost by 17.5% in average compared to @xcite , except for a few of the cases in which ordering of the qubit lines have worsened the situation .",
    "the execution times of the algorithm are also negligible .",
    "the percentage decrease in quantum cost due to the reordering of qubit lines , considering all the circuits as given in table i is about 47% .",
    "+    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in this work , we have focussed on linear nearest neighbor architecture where swap gates are introduced between the qubit lines whenever it is not in nn architecture .",
    "the method proposed reduces the swap gate count significantly for the revlib benchmark circuits .",
    "it has also led to an appreciable decrease in the overall quantum cost for most of the benchmark circuits compared to the related works , and by 47% on an average .",
