    "mobile devices can establish opportunistic networks  a flavour of delay - tolerant networks ( dtns ) @xcite  among each other in a self - organising manner and facilitate communication without the need for network infrastructure .",
    "the capabilities of today s smart mobile devices yield substantial computing and storage resources and means for creating , viewing , archiving , manipulating , and sharing content .",
    "in addition , content downloaded from internet is recommended to be cached at the handset  @xcite .",
    "this yields a huge reserve of data stored in mobile devices , which users may be willing to share .",
    "while this is typically done using internet - based services , opportunistic networks enable content sharing among users in close proximity of each other .    in this paper , we focus on a human - centric dtn , where nodes search for information stored in some of the nodes .",
    "the nodes lack a global view of the network , i.e. , there is no service that could index the stored content and assist a searching node in finding content ( or indicate that the sought information does not exist ) .",
    "this means that operations are decentralized and , as mobile nodes have resource constraints ( e.g. , energy ) , we need to control the spread of the messages when searching .",
    "one such control mechanism is imposing the maximum number of hops a message can travel .",
    "we call a search scheme that limits the message s path to maximum @xmath0 hops as @xmath0-hop search .",
    "_ hop - limited search _",
    "@xcite is of our interest as it is a lightweight scheme that does not require intensive information collection about the nodes or the content items .",
    "however , determining the optimal @xmath0 is not straightforward .",
    "although a large @xmath0 tends to increase replication , it also increases the chance of finding the desirable target ( content or searching node ) , thereby decreasing replication .",
    "while many works in the literature apply hop limitations  @xcite , mostly two - hop such as @xcite , to the designed routing protocols , the motivation behind setting a particular hop value is not clear . in @xcite",
    ", we analyze the effect of hop limit on the routing performance by modelling the optimal hop limited routing as _ all hops optimal path _ problem  @xcite .",
    "however , opportunistic search necessitates considering the availability of the sought content as well as routing of the response to the searching node . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we analytically modelled the search utility and derived the optimal hop count for a linear network , e.g. , search flows through a single path and response messages follow the same path . in this paper , we provide an elaborate analysis of hop - limited search in a mobile opportunistic network considering the search success , completion time , and the cost .",
    "search is a two - phase process .",
    "we refer to the first phase in which query is routed towards the content providers as _ forward path _ and the second phase in which response is routed towards the searching node as _",
    "return path_. first , we present an analysis on the forward path via an analytical model .",
    "we show the interplay between tolerated waiting time ( how long the searching node can wait for the forward path ) , content availability , and the hop count providing the maximum search success ratio for a specific setting .",
    "next , we verify our analysis of the forward path and elaborate also on the return path via simulations .",
    "our results suggest the following :    * generally speaking , search performance increases with increasing @xmath0 especially for scarcely available content .",
    "however , the highest improvement is often achieved at the second hop .",
    "after that , the improvements become smaller and practically diminish when @xmath1 . *",
    "we observe that return path requires on average longer hops / time compared to the forward path , which may imply that optimal settings for the forward path does not yield the optimal performance on the return path .",
    "* we show that the search cost first increases and after several hops ( @xmath2 ) it tends to stabilise .",
    "this is due to the small diameter of the network ; even if @xmath0 is large letting the nodes replicate a message to other nodes , each node gets informed about the search status quickly so that replication of obsolete messages is stopped .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sysmodel ] introduces the considered system model followed by section  [ sec : hoplimited ] introducing the hop - limited search .",
    "section  [ sec : numericalanalysis ] numerically analyzes the forward path , while section  [ sec : sims ] focuses on the whole search process .",
    "section  [ sec : related ] overviews the related work and highlights the points that distinguish our work from the others .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a mobile opportunistic network of @xmath3 nodes as in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "nodes move according to a mobility model which results in i.i.d .",
    "meeting rates between any two nodes .",
    "we use the following terminology : * searching node ( @xmath4 ) * is a node that initiates the search for a content item . we assume that content items are equally likely to be sought , i.e. , uniform _",
    "content popularity_. in reality , content items have diverse popularities ; e.g. , youtube video popularity follows a zipf distribution  @xcite .",
    "we choose uniform distribution to avoid a bias toward the `` easy '' searches .",
    "* tagged node * is a node that holds a copy of the sought content .",
    "only a fraction @xmath5 of the nodes are tagged , where @xmath5 is referred to as the _ content availability_. although it is expected that search dynamics such as caching changes @xmath6 , we assume that it does not change over time .",
    "the sets of all and tagged nodes are denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and their sizes @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . the number of tagged nodes is @xmath11 .",
    "every node is equally likely to be a tagged node .",
    "* forward path and return path : * in the first step of the search , a query is disseminated in the network to find a tagged node . in case",
    "the first step is completed , a response generated by a content provider is routed back towards @xmath4 in the second step .",
    "we refer to the former as the _ forward _ or _ query path _ and to the latter as the _ return _ or _ response path_. * tolerated waiting time ( @xmath12 ) * is the maximum duration to find the content  ( excluding the return path ) . note that total tolerated waiting time is @xmath13 if we assume the same delay restriction for the return path .",
    "to describe the basic operation of hop - limited search , assume that @xmath4 creates a query that includes information about its search at time @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath4 encounters another node that does not have this query , @xmath4 replicates the query to it to reach a tagged node faster .",
    "a node acquiring a copy of the message becomes a _",
    "discovered node_. the discovered node also starts to search and replicate the query to _",
    "undiscovered nodes_. each message contains a header , referred to as _ hop count _ , representing the number of nodes that forwarded this message so far .",
    "messages at @xmath4 are 0-hop messages ; those received directly from @xmath4 are @xmath15-hop messages .",
    "we refer to a search scheme as @xmath0-hop search if a search message can travel at most @xmath0 hops .",
    "hence , when a node has @xmath0-hop message , it does not forward it further .",
    "we also call a node with a @xmath16-hop message as the @xmath16-hop node for that particular message . in @xmath0-hop search , when an @xmath16-hop and @xmath17-hop node meet ( without loss of generality we assume @xmath18 ) , the state of @xmath17-hop node is updated to @xmath19-hop if @xmath20 .",
    "the forward path completes when a copy of the query reaches a tagged node .",
    "let us first consider a search scheme that does not put any hop limitation but instead limits the total number of replications on the forward path and the return path to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . for a content item with availability @xmath6 , we can calculate the forward success ratio of this search scheme as : @xmath23 similarly , we calculate the search success ratio , i.e. , both steps are completed , as : @xmath24 we can expand the above formulation which leads to : @xmath25 let @xmath26 , i.e. , the probability that a response reaches @xmath4 . after replacing @xmath27 into ( [ eq : ps ] ) ,",

    "the results are for equal number of replications for the forward and return path , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the figure shows that to ensure a desirable level of success , search has to cover certain fraction of nodes , which depends on the content availability . in hop - limited search",
    ", there is no explicit restriction on number of replications @xmath21 , but rather it is implicitly set by @xmath0 and @xmath12 .",

    "can also be explained by `` _ _ shrinking diameter _ _ '' phenomenon , which states that the average distance between two nodes decreases over time as networks grow  @xcite .",

    "this result may be conflicting with the intuition that the information found in nearby / far - away will also be routed back quickly / slowly . however , search process is more complicated due to the intertwined effects of mobility and restrictions on the total search time .",
    "for example , consider a forward path with a very large number of hops . due to the remaining short time before the tolerated waiting time expires , search can only go a few hops towards the searching node .",
    "this leads to a long forward path with a very short return path which challenges the above - mentioned intuition . with higher content availability",
    ", the required number of forward hops decreases whereas the return path length seems to be barely affected .",
    "hence , the corresponding @xmath117 and @xmath118 increase . for all scenarios ,",
    "return path is on the average longer than the forward path .",
    "using this observation , a tagged node receiving a query can set the time - to - live field of its response message longer than the received query s forward path time .      obviously , increasing hop count increases the neighborhood which in turn increases the chance of finding the sought content .",
    "however , the larger neighborhood should also be interpreted as larger number of replication , i.e. , higher search cost . in fact , the neighborhood size represents the upper bound of number of replications for a search message if no other search stopping algorithm is in effect . in this section",
    ", we evaluate the cost of search considering two simple mechanisms that aim to keep replication much below the upper bound set by @xmath102 .",
    "we consider three cases : ( i ) oracle : there is a central entity from which a node retrieves the global state of a message in its buffer and can ignore it if outdated , e.g. a completed search or a query already reaching a tagged node , ( ii ) exch : upon encounter , nodes exchange their local knowledge about search activities in the network , ( iii ) local : nodes exchange their knowledge _ only _ on the shared messages .",
    "note that an oracle can be an entity in the cellular network and nodes can access it via a control channel .",
    "in fact , this communication with the cellular network is more costly  ( e.g. , energy ) compared to the opportunistic communication .",
    "nevertheless , this scenario serves as an optimal benchmark to assess the performance of the other scenarios .",
    "exch pro - actively spreads information about existing queries to all nodes opportunistically , which may be considered as leaking information to nodes not involved in search .",
    "local circumvents this by only using its local knowledge and sharing information with peers only about queries that the other node has already seen .",
    "[ fig : costoraclevsnooracle ] shows _ query spread ratio _ which is defined as i.e. , the fraction of nodes that have seen this query , and search time .",
    "first , we should note that the resulting search success ( not plotted ) is almost the same under all schemes .",
    "second , note the non - increasing query spread ratio for @xmath1 .",
    "this result confirms that the network is a small - world network where all nodes get informed quickly about the search status and drop the outdated messages timely .",
    "hence , even for larger @xmath0 , nodes detect the outdated messages via local and shared knowledge . in fig .",
    "[ fig : queryspreadratio15_600_015 ] , we observe that exch maintains the same performance as oracle , whereas local results in more replication as fewer nodes are informed about the completed queries / responses . nevertheless , because of the small network diameter , a higher @xmath0 does not result in an explosion of query spread in the network .",
    "regarding search time , we observe substantial decrease in search time also for @xmath119 and @xmath120 in contrast to the vanishing benefits after second hop derived from our analytical model  ( table  [ tab : searchtime_markovchain ] ) .",
    "search time tends to stabilise after @xmath121 .",
    "hence , although several hops are sufficient in terms of search success , further hops ( e.g. , @xmath2 ) can be considered for faster search .",
    "our analysis shows that the two factors affecting the optimal hop count are the content availability ( @xmath5 ) and the product of meeting rate and tolerated waiting time ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the latter is the number of meetings before tolerated waiting time expires where @xmath81 depends on network density and mobility model .",
    "if both @xmath5 and @xmath122 are low ( scarce content and very few contacts due to network sparsity or short search time ) , search performance is expected to be low .",
    "however , it increases with increase in either of these factors . if one of these factors is large , it is sufficient to have a low hop count limit ( e.g. , two or three ) to obtain good performance .",
    "that is , when @xmath123 is large relative to the expected number of tagged nodes met during the search time , limiting the search to a few hops still achieves good results . as @xmath123 decreases , the required hop limit to maintain good search performance is larger .",
    "this allows devising adaptation when issuing search queries .",
    "nodes can monitor the request and response rate for certain ( types of ) content items and thus infer popularity and availability in their area .",
    "they can also assess the regional node density and meeting rate @xmath81 and thus determine the required hop count @xmath0 given @xmath12 or vice versa .",
    "moreover , nodes can monitor search performance and determine how well their ( region in a ) network operates . to improve performance",
    ", nodes can decide to increase the availability of selected contents via active replication of the scarce content , obviously trading off storage capacity and link capacity for availability .",
    "such decision could be based entirely upon local observations , but could also consider limited information exchange with other nodes .",
    "we believe that with the guidance of our analysis , a node can decide on the best hop count depending on the network density and the content availability that can both be derived from past observations by the node .",
    "although we show that search cost stops increasing after a few hops , keeping @xmath0 low may be desirable if we interpret it as a measure of the social relation between two nodes ( e.g. , one hop as friends ; two hop as friend - of - friend ) . in other words , lower",
    "@xmath0 can be interpreted as more _ trustworthy _ operation .",
    "moreover , protocols involving lower number of relays are more scalable and energy - efficient  @xcite .",
    "while the dtn literature has many proposals for message dissemination , which exploit the information about the network such as ( estimated ) pairwise node contact rates , node centrality , communities , and social ties , efficient mechanisms for content search remain largely unexplored . in a sense , this is reasonable as search can be considered as a two - step message delivery : query routing on the forward path and the response routing on the return path .",
    "the forward path is less certain as the content providers are unknown . in this regard ,",
    "the return path is less challenging as the target node ( and a recent path to reach it ) is already known .",
    "however , routing the response looks for a particular node , whereas the forward search is for a _ subset of nodes _ whose cardinality is proportional to the content availability .",
    "thus , search requires special treatment rather than being an extension of the message dissemination .",
    "two questions for an efficient search are ( i ) which nodes may have the content  @xcite and ( ii ) when to stop a search  @xcite",
    ". the former question requires assessment of each node in terms of its potential of being a provider for the sought content .",
    "for example , _ seeker assisted search _ ( sas )  @xcite estimates the nodes in the same community to have higher likelihood of holding the content as people in the same community might have already retrieved the content .",
    "given that people sharing a common interest come together at a certain  space \" ( e.g. , office , gyms ) , @xcite defines _ geo - community _ concept and matches each query with a particular geo - community .",
    "hence , the first question boils down to selecting relays with high probability of visiting the target geo - community . as @xcite aims to keep the search cost minimal , searching node employs two - hop routing and determines the relays , which thereby reduces the issue of when to stop the search .",
    "deciding when to stop search is nontrivial as the search follows several paths and whether the searching node has already discovered a response is not known by the relaying nodes .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite model the expected search utility with increasing hop count and then finds the optimal hop , while @xcite estimates the number of nodes having received a query and possible responses by using the node degrees . in our work",
    ", we showed that simple schemes via information sharing can stop search timely and maintain similar performance to that of an oracle due to the small world nature of the studied networks .",
    "different from all these above works , main focus of our paper is more on a fundamental question : _ how does the hop limitation affect the search performance ? _",
    "while this question has been explored in general networking context , content - centricity and the time constraints require a better understanding of flooding in the context of search .",
    "therefore , we first provided insights on search on a simplified setting and next analyzed the effect of various parameters , e.g. , time and real mobility traces , via extensive simulations .",
    "in the literature , several works focus on two - hop forwarding in which the source node replicates the message to any relay and the relays can deliver the message only to the final destination  @xcite .",
    "et al . _ in their seminal work  @xcite show that two hops are sufficient to achieve the maximum throughput capacity in an ideal network with nodes moving randomly .",
    "the capacity increase is facilitated by the reduced interference on the links from source to relay and relay to the destination .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite assess this two - hop forwarding scheme in a dtn scenario with power - law inter - contact times and employ an _ oblivious forwarding algorithm _",
    "( e.g. , memoryless routers that do not use any context information such as contact history ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite focuses on a dtn with power - law distributed inter - contact times and derives the conditions ( i.e. range of pareto shape parameter ) under which message delivery has a finite delay bound for both two - hop and multi - hop oblivious algorithms .",
    "the authors show that `` _ _ as long as the convergence of message delivery delay is the only concern , paths longer than two - hops do not help convergence _ _ '' as two hops are sufficient to explore the relaying diversity of the network  @xcite .",
    "another work supporting two - hop schemes is @xcite which shows that two - hop search is favourable for opportunistic networks a resource - scarce setting , as ",
    "_ one - hop neighbors are able to cover the most of the network in a reasonable time _ \" in a network with _",
    "sufficiently many _ mobile nodes . in our work",
    ", we include those cases when longer paths still yield ( some ) performance improvement .",
    "finally , our work supports the conclusion of @xcite , which theoretically proves the _ small - world _ in human mobile networks .",
    "our work is closely related to the @xmath124-hop flooding @xcite which models the spread of flooded messages in a random graph .",
    "unlike @xcite , we focus on content search in a realistic setting , and using real mobility traces  ( both a human contact network and a vehicular network ) we provide insights on the effect of increasing hop count on the search success , delay , and cost under various content availability and tolerated waiting time settings . despite the differences , it is worthwhile noting that our results agree with the basic conclusions of @xcite .",
    "given the volume of the content created , downloaded , and stored in the mobile devices , efficient opportunistic search is paramount to make the remote content accessible to a mobile user .",
    "current schemes mostly rely on routing based on hop limitations . to provide insights about the basics of such a generic search scheme",
    ", we focused on a hop - limited search in mobile opportunistic networks . first , by modelling only the forward path , we showed that ( i ) the second hop and following few hops bring the highest gains in terms of forward path success ratio and ( ii ) compared to single - hop delivery , increase in hop count leads to shorter search time and after a few hops search time tends to stabilize .",
    "next , we revisited these findings via simulations of the entire search process .",
    "while simulations validated our claim for the forward path , we observed that return path on average requires longer time and more hops .",
    "moreover , our results do not indicate strong correlation between the return and forward paths .",
    "finally , we showed that search completes in less than five hops in most cases .",
    "this is attributed to the small diameter of the human contact network which has also a positive impact on search cost ; nodes are informed about search state quickly and stop propagation of obsolete messages .",
    "our simulations validated that increasing hop count to several hops accelerates the search and later search completion time stabilizes .",
    "as future work , we will design a search scheme that adapts the hop count of query and response paths based on the observed content availability and popularity .",
    "moreover , we believe that content - centric approaches should be paid more attention to implement efficient search schemes in mobile opportunistic networks .",
