    "measuring supermassive black hole masses ( @xmath13 ) as a function of galaxy mass and cosmic time is one of the great challenges in observational astrophysics . a vital technique for measuring @xmath13",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "reverberation mapping traces the time lag between variable continuum emission from the accretion disk and the larger gas clouds that this emission photoionizes .",
    "this results in broad emission line variability lagging behind the continuum emission .",
    "the lag time provides a distance scale due to the light travel time between the continuum source and the broad line region ( blr ) , while the broad line doppler width provides a velocity . from these , and assumptions about the geometry and kinematics of the blr , one can infer @xmath14 .",
    "reverberation mapping has been applied to dozens of nearby agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resulting @xmath15 relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is the basis for the `` single - epoch '' virial mass methods employed to track the growth history and redshift evolution of supermassive black holes ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "reverberation mapping campaigns are labor intensive and expensive in terms of telescope time and human effort .",
    "they often require telescope time allocations over multiple periods with classically scheduled facilities .",
    "a potentially transformative facility for reverberation mapping , and time domain studies , is the las cumbres observatory global telescope network ( lcogt ; * ? ? ?",
    "lcogt is currently composed of nine 1-m imaging telescopes at sites around the globe and two 2-m faulkes telescopes , equipped with imagers and the floyds robotic spectrographs .",
    "lcogt is completely robotic , from the scheduling of the telescopes to the placement of targets onto spectrograph slits .",
    "facilities such as lcogt are ideally suited to conduct intensive reverberation mapping campaigns , as well as persistent multi - season efforts on luminous or higher redshift agn .    the agn key project ( pi : k. horne ) has been allocated substantial resources on the lcogt network to conduct several agn studies , including reverberation mapping of both local and high - redshift objects . here",
    "we report our first results  an intensive @xmath0200 day long reverberation mapping campaign of the well - studied , local seyfert 1 galaxy arp  151 ( also known as mrk 40 ) .",
    "arp  151 was selected as part of an initial sample of low - redshift agns at lcogt based on its strong variability in past campaigns @xcite .",
    "our all - robotic observations show a clear velocity - resolved reverberation lag .",
    "these data allow us to investigate the time variability of the blr over a time much longer than the lag and to infer the black hole mass in arp 151 .",
    "we verify the virial product remains constant independent of an agn luminosity change , and demonstrate the promise of agn studies with the lcogt network .",
    "we obtained high signal to noise ratio @xmath1-band imaging of arp  151 from 11 november 2014 to 4 july 2015 with near - daily cadence .",
    "observations were carried out with the 1-m telescope at mcdonald observatory and the 2-m faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) at haleakala , hawaii .",
    "the mcdonald 1 m telescope was fitted out with a sbig stx-16803 ccd with a 158@xmath16158 field of view , sampled with 0464 pixels .",
    "the ftn observations were taken with the spectral camera , with a 105@xmath16105 field of view and a binned pixel scale of 030 .",
    "typical exposure times were 2@xmath16120 s per visit .",
    "initial photometric data reduction , including overscan subtraction and flat fielding , was done via the lcogt data pipeline @xcite .",
    "after this , the images were cleaned of cosmic rays using the l.a .",
    "cosmic algorithm @xcite .",
    "in order to register the celestial coordinates across the set of images , we used the _",
    "software package @xcite .",
    "aperture photometry was applied using the automated idl procedures described by @xcite , using four comparison stars to construct a relative light curve .",
    "an aperture radius of 5  and sky annulus radii of 1530   were used throughout .",
    "photometry measurements from images taken within 6 hours of each other were combined to produce a weighted average magnitude for the final light curve .",
    "no attempt was made to remove host - galaxy light from the agn photometry .",
    "we then used the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to flux calibrate the data .",
    "the final @xmath1-band light curve of 119 data points exhibits a sharp flux peak with amplitude @xmath00.3 mag , ideal for measurement of broad - line reverberation ( figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) .",
    "floyds robotic spectroscopic observations of arp  151 were carried out between 2014 december 6 and 2015 june 5 .",
    "all observations were taken at the parallactic angle with a 16@xmath1630  slit and an exposure time of 3600 s. in all , 55 spectra of arp  151 contribute to our emission line light curve analysis .",
    "the floyds spectrographs are a pair of nearly identical instruments at the faulkes telescopes north and south ( arp  151 spectra , however , were all observed with ftn ) .",
    "they operate totally robotically , drastically lowering the human effort necessary to conduct long and intensive reverberation mapping campaigns .",
    "targets are automatically placed in the slit using an acquisition camera and a fast cross correlation algorithm to recognize the field and place the science object in the slit .",
    "floyds uses a low dispersion grating ( 235 lines mm@xmath17 ) and a cross - dispersed prism to work in first and second order simultaneously , giving a single - shot wavelength coverage of @xmath03200 to 10000 .",
    "first order wavelength coverage extends over @xmath04800 to 10000    with a pixel scale of 3.51    pixel@xmath17 ( resolution 13 ) , while second order covers 3200 to 5900    at 1.74   pixel@xmath17 ( resolution 7 )  for convenience , we will refer to these as the red and blue side , respectively .",
    "the significant order overlap allows the h@xmath2 emission line to be observed in both orders simultaneously , providing a check on our systematic uncertainties related to emission line measurements .",
    "the median continuum s / n per pixel is 22.5 at 4600   on the blue side and 61.2 at 6400   on the red side .    the spectroscopic data were batch reduced with a modified version of the floyds data reduction pipeline called agnfloyds , written in a pyraf / python framework .",
    "briefly , agnfloyds performs standard image detrending ( overscan subtraction , flat fielding and defringing ) , cosmic ray rejection ( via the l.a .",
    "cosmic algorithm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , order rectification , spectral extraction , and flux and wavelength calibration .",
    "each spectral order is processed separately .",
    "we utilize a fixed , unweighted extraction aperture of 88 to minimize the effect of varying seeing conditions throughout the campaign .",
    "error spectra were produced and propagated forward for the emission line light curve measurements .",
    "all spectra were reduced without human intervention .",
    "emission line measurements were carried out on the floyds spectra in a similar way as the recent lick agn monitoring project 2011 reverberation mapping campaign @xcite , with the blue and red side spectra treated separately .",
    "first , the reduced spectra were placed on a uniform flux and wavelength scale utilizing the procedure of @xcite , which applies a linear wavelength shift , flux scaling factor and gaussian broadening term to minimize differences in the spectral region around the [ ] @xmath185007 line from night to night , under the assumption that this narrow line has a constant flux during the spectroscopic campaign .",
    "after this procedure was performed , the excess rms scatter of the [ ] light curve in our spectroscopic time series was @xmath02% for both the blue and red side spectra , similar to recent reverberation mapping work , which can be considered as a measure of the random error in flux calibration of the final scaled spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . the final mean and rms spectra can be seen in figure  [ fig : meanrms ] , constructed following @xcite ;",
    "note that the [ ] line almost completely disappears in the rms spectrum of both the red and blue arm , showing the high quality of the dataset .    for the blue - side scaled spectra , we performed spectral decomposition over a wavelength range of @xmath042005300   in a manner identical to @xcite in order to isolate the h@xmath2 , h@xmath4 and emission lines for our light curve measurements .",
    "briefly , an eight - component model is fit to the daily , scaled spectra utilizing the idl mpfit package @xcite .",
    "the components of the model include : 1 ) a stellar spectrum with a single burst age of 11 gyr and solar metallicity @xcite ; 2 ) a power - law agn featureless continuum component ; 3 ) the [ ] @xmath184959 , 5007 lines ; 4 ) broad and narrow h@xmath2 ; 5 ) broad and narrow ; 6 ) broad ; 7 ) an blend contribution utilizing the templates of @xcite ; and 8) a @xcite reddening law with the color excess , @xmath19 as a free parameter .",
    "the wavelength region around the h@xmath4 and [ ] @xmath184363 lines was masked out from 42804400    during the fitting process due to their complexity ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "once the best - fitting spectral decomposition is found , all components except for the broad and narrow h@xmath2 component were subtracted from each spectrum , leaving only the h@xmath2 and h@xmath4 lines and fitting residuals in the resulting spectra .",
    "light curves of these decomposed spectra were generated via direct integration , and can be seen in figure  [ fig : lcs ] . note that both of these light curves include a narrow line component , and the h@xmath4 light curve includes a contribution from the [ ] @xmath184363 line .",
    "the light curve of the relatively weak @xmath184686 line was determined directly from each night s best - fitting model component spectrum , which includes both broad and narrow components .",
    "the emission proved to be too weak to yield a useful light curve .",
    "for the red - side scaled spectra , we measure both the h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 ( which includes contributions from the narrow [ ] @xmath186548 , 6583 lines ) fluxes by direct integration after subtracting a simple linear continuum from adjacent line - free regions .",
    "the h@xmath2 light curve derived in this way agrees remarkably well with the floyds blue - side h@xmath2 light curve , derived via our spectral fits ( compare the blue and red points in the h@xmath2 panel of figure  [ fig : lcs ] ) .",
    "the emission line light curves in figure  [ fig : lcs ] show a morphology similar to that seen in the @xmath1-band light curve , with a factor of 3 rise and decline during the @xmath0200 day period of our campaign . for all of our emission - line light curves",
    ", we have measured the normalized rms variability amplitude @xmath20   ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we present these values in table  [ table : cc_results ] .",
    "in general , values of @xmath21 correspond to strong line variations that are amenable to accurate lag measurement ( provided that the light curve exhibits sufficient structure rather than a simple monotonic increase or decrease in flux ) . the light curves for h@xmath3 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath4 , and all exhibit variations well in excess of this threshold .",
    "we also note that as a consistency check we derived emission line light curves using the software suite prepspec , developed by k. horne ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of the software ) , and found similar light curves for all the lines measured here .",
    "we employ standard cross - correlation function ( ccf ) techniques , utilizing the interpolation and monte carlo error analysis methodology of previous reverberation mapping workers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in order to measure robust lags in our dataset .",
    "we measured cross - correlations of h@xmath3 , h@xmath2 ( on the red and blue side spectra independently ) , h@xmath4 and against the @xmath1-band light curve from @xmath2220 to + 40 days in increments of 0.25 days .",
    "we show the ccf measurements in figure  [ fig : ccf ] , and present the results in table  [ table : cc_results ] . in table",
    "[ table : cc_results ] , @xmath23  corresponds to the peak of the ccf and @xmath24  corresponds to the centroid of the ccf for all points above 80% of the peak value @xcite .",
    "first , the blue and red side h@xmath2 lags are in excellent agreement , with @xmath25 and 8.59@xmath26 days , respectively , lending confidence to our data reduction and analysis techniques .",
    "the h@xmath4 lag of @xmath27 days is consistent with the h@xmath2 measurements , while the lag is consistent with zero ( @xmath28 days ) .",
    "we also measure an h@xmath3 lag , @xmath29 days , that is substantially larger than that of h@xmath2 .",
    "the relative lags between each line are consistent with that seen in other reverberation mapped systems , along with previous measurements of arp  151 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "while the 2015 lcogt reverberation lags are a factor of @xmath02 larger than the lags previously measured by @xcite from the 2008 lick campaign , arp  151 s h@xmath2 velocity width is smaller than measured in the 2008 data , leading to virtually the same virial products  see ",
    "[ sec : mbh ] .",
    "past data on arp  151 have demonstrated velocity - resolved variability and lags @xcite .",
    "we measured h@xmath2 light curves in seven velocity bins across the width of the line ( utilizing our blue - side floyds data ) , and cross - correlated each with the @xmath1-band light curve .",
    "we plot our velocity - resolved lag results ( @xmath24 ) in figure  [ fig : v_ccf ] , which shows a similar morphology as previous velocity - resolved work in arp  151 .",
    "the h@xmath2 lag response is clearly asymmetric , with an @xmath08 day difference between the lag in the h@xmath2 core and the red wing of the line .",
    "the lag profile is similar in shape to that seen in the 2008 lick data @xcite , despite the factor of @xmath30 increase in the overall h@xmath2 lag since 2008 .",
    "a symmetric h@xmath2 lag response , declining on both the blue and red wings of the line , would be consistent with the blr clouds in keplerian , circular orbits around the black hole @xcite .",
    "however , the velocity lags such as that seen in arp  151 , with higher lags on the blue wing , with a decline towards the red , are generally consistent with blr models with radial inflow and/or a warped disk morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the width of the broad h@xmath2 line is needed for determining black hole masses from reverberation data , which we measure following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "first we use the results of the spectral decompositions of the nightly second order floyds spectra to remove all components except for the broad h@xmath2 emission from the data . from these broad h@xmath2-only spectra",
    ", we construct mean and rms spectra and measure the line width parameters following the methods of @xcite .",
    "uncertainties are calculated via a monte carlo resampling technique .",
    "the instrumental resolution of floyds with the 16 slit near the h@xmath2 line is fwhm=7  , corresponding to @xmath31430 km s@xmath17 ( or @xmath32183 km s@xmath17 ) , and we subtract this small contribution in quadrature for our final results .",
    "the broad h@xmath2 from the mean spectrum has a fwhm(h@xmath33)=2872@xmath3490 km s@xmath17 [ @xmath35(h@xmath36)=1591@xmath3455 km  s@xmath17 ] , while for the rms spectrum it is fwhm(h@xmath38)=1833@xmath3461 km  s@xmath17 [ @xmath35(h@xmath39)=879@xmath3457 km s@xmath17 ] .    the measured h@xmath2 virial product , defined as vp = @xmath40(@xmath41@xmath1)@xmath42/@xmath43 ,",
    "is determined by using @xmath41@xmath1=@xmath35(h@xmath44 ) and @xmath40=@xmath45@xmath24 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we find to be vp=1.13@xmath4610@xmath11  @xmath12 .",
    "this value for the virial product is consistent to within the uncertainties with previous determinations of @xmath13   in arp  151 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which also indicates that @xmath47 , as is expected for a virial relationship between time lag and line width .    to convert our directly measured virial product into a black hole mass requires an additional dimensionless factor , @xmath9 , which depends on the geometry , kinematics and orientation of the blr",
    "while recent work has made great progress in directly determining the value of @xmath9 for individual agn @xcite , we adopt a value of @xmath9=5.5 , which was found by @xcite to bring the agn @xmath48@xmath49 relationship into agreement with the same relationship for quiescent galaxies .",
    "we then find @xmath48=6.2@xmath5010@xmath11  @xmath12 , where the quoted uncertainty comes only from the uncertainty on the virial product and not on the adopted value of @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath13  is simply the virial product multipled by the @xmath9-factor , this result is also in agreement with previous work on arp  151 and consistent with @xcite and @xcite within the uncertainties .",
    "we have presented the first totally robotic agn reverberation mapping measurements for the nearby seyfert 1 galaxy arp  151 as part of the lcogt agn key project .",
    "robust lag measurements were measured for the h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 and h@xmath4 lines , and we were able to measure a velocity - resolved h@xmath2 lag with a profile similar to that seen in previous work . by combining the lag measurements with line width measurements , we infer a central black hole mass of @xmath48=6.2@xmath5010@xmath11  @xmath12 , again in accordance with previous measurements in this system .",
    "arp  151 is now one of just a few agn where it has been shown that the virial product remains constant against substantial changes in h@xmath2 lag and luminosity .",
    "ngc  5548 is the best example with many years of monitoring and an order of magnitude variation in luminosity over the years @xcite .",
    "the reverberation mapping portion of the lcogt agn key project has collected data on other low - redshift agn as well as higher redshift quasars . in particular",
