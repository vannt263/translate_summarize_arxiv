    "cp violation has major potentialities to exhibit manifestations of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "indeed , it is quite a general feature that new physics possesses new cp violating phases in addition to the cabibbo ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) phase @xmath0 or , even in those cases where this does not occur , @xmath1 shows up in interactions of the new particles , hence with potential departures from the sm expectations .",
    "moreover , although the sm is able to account for the observed cp violation in the kaon system , we can not say that we have tested so far the sm predictions for cp violation .",
    "the detection of cp violation in @xmath2 physics will constitute a crucial test of the standard ckm picture within the sm .",
    "again , on general grounds , we expect new physics to provide departures from the sm ckm scenario for cp violation in @xmath2 physics . a final remark on reasons that make us optimistic in having new physics playing a major role in cp violation concerns the matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry in the universe .",
    "starting from a baryon ",
    "antibaryon symmetric universe , the sm is unable to account for the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "the presence of new cp  violating contributions when one goes beyond the sm looks crucial to produce an efficient mechanism for the generation of a satisfactory @xmath3b asymmetry .",
    "the above considerations apply well to the new physics represented by low  energy supersymmetric extensions of the sm . indeed , as we will see below , supersymmetry introduces cp violating phases in addition to @xmath1 and , even if one envisages particular situations where such extra  phases vanish , the phase @xmath1 itself leads to new cp  violating contributions in processes where susy particles are exchanged .",
    "cp violation in @xmath2 decays has all potentialities to exhibit departures from the sm ckm picture in low ",
    "energy susy extensions , although , as we will discuss , the detectability of such deviations strongly depends on the regions of the susy parameter space under consideration .    in any mssm , at least two new `` genuine '' susy cp  violating phases are present .",
    "they originate from the susy parameters @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "the first of these parameters is the dimensionful coefficient of the @xmath7 term of the superpotential .",
    "the remaining three parameters are present in the sector that softly breaks the n=1 global susy .",
    "@xmath5 denotes the common value of the gaugino masses , @xmath6 is the trilinear scalar coupling , while @xmath2 denotes the bilinear scalar coupling . in our notation",
    ", all these three parameters are dimensionful . the simplest way to see which combinations of the phases of these four parameters",
    "are physical @xcite is to notice that for vanishing values of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 the theory possesses two additional symmetries @xcite . indeed , letting @xmath2 and @xmath4 vanish , a @xmath8 peccei  quinn symmetry originates , which in particular rotates @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 are set to zero , the lagrangian acquires a continuous @xmath8 @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "then we can consider @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath2 as spurions which break the @xmath12 and @xmath13 symmetries . in this way",
    ", the question concerning the number and nature of the meaningful phases translates into the problem of finding the independent combinations of the four parameters which are invariant under @xmath12 and @xmath13 and determining their independent phases .",
    "there are three such independent combinations , but only two of their phases are independent .",
    "we use here the commonly adopted choice : @xmath14 where also @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 .    the main constraints on @xmath17 and @xmath18 come from their contribution to the electric dipole moments of the neutron and of the electron .",
    "for instance , the effect of @xmath17 and @xmath18 on the electric and chromoelectric dipole moments of the light quarks ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) lead to a contribution to @xmath22 of order @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 here denotes a common mass for squarks and gluinos .",
    "the present experimental bound , @xmath25 e cm , implies that @xmath26 should be @xmath27 , unless one pushes susy masses up to @xmath28(1 tev ) .",
    "a possible caveat to such an argument calling for a fine  tuning of @xmath26 is that uncertainties in the estimate of the hadronic matrix elements could relax the severe bound in eq .",
    "( [ edmnmssm ] ) @xcite .    in view of the previous considerations ,",
    "most authors dealing with the mssm prefer to simply put @xmath17 and @xmath18 equal to zero .",
    "actually , one may argue in favor of this choice by considering the soft breaking sector of the mssm as resulting from susy breaking mechanisms which force @xmath17 and @xmath18 to vanish .",
    "for instance , it is conceivable that both @xmath6 and @xmath5 originate from one same source of @xmath13 breaking . since @xmath17 `` measures '' the relative phase of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , in this case it would `` naturally''vanish . in some specific models , it has been shown @xcite that through an analogous mechanism also",
    "@xmath18 may vanish .",
    "if @xmath29 , then the novelty of susy in cp violating contributions merely arises from the presence of the ckm phase in loops where susy particles run @xcite .",
    "the crucial point is that the usual gim suppression , which plays a major role in evaluating @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the sm , in the mssm case ( or more exactly in the cmssm ) is replaced by a super  gim cancellation which has the same `` power '' of suppression as the original gim ( see previous section ) .",
    "again , also in the cmssm , as it is the case in the sm , the smallness of @xmath30 and @xmath31 is guaranteed not by the smallness of @xmath1 , but rather by the small ckm angles and/or small yukawa couplings . by the same token",
    ", we do not expect any significant departure of the cmssm from the sm predictions also concerning cp violation in @xmath2 physics .",
    "as a matter of fact , given the large lower bounds on squark and gluino masses , one expects relatively tiny contributions of the susy loops in @xmath30 or @xmath31 in comparison with the normal @xmath32 loops of the sm .",
    "let us be more detailed on this point .    in the cmssm ,",
    "the gluino exchange contribution to fcnc is subleading with respect to chargino ( @xmath33 ) and charged higgs ( @xmath34 ) exchanges .",
    "hence , when dealing with cp violating fcnc processes in the cmssm with @xmath29 , one can confine the analysis to @xmath33 and @xmath34 loops .",
    "if one takes all squarks to be degenerate in mass and heavier than @xmath35 gev , then @xmath36 loops are obviously severely penalized with respect to the sm @xmath37@xmath38 loops ( remember that at the vertices the same ckm angles occur in both cases ) .",
    "the only chance for the cmssm to produce some sizeable departure from the sm situation in cp violation is in the particular region of the parameter space where one has light @xmath39 , @xmath33 and/or @xmath34 .",
    "the best candidate ( indeed the only one unless @xmath40 ) for a light squark is the stop .",
    "hence one can ask the following question : can the cmssm present some novelties in cp  violating phenomena when we consider @xmath41@xmath42 loops with light @xmath42 , @xmath41 and/or @xmath43 ?    several analyses in the literature tackle the above question or , to be more precise , the more general problem of the effect of light @xmath42 and @xmath41 on fcnc processes @xcite .",
    "a first important observation concerns the relative sign of the @xmath37@xmath44 loop with respect to the @xmath41@xmath42 and @xmath43@xmath44 contributions .",
    "as it is well known , the latter contribution always interferes positively with the sm one .",
    "interestingly enough , in the region of the mssm parameter space that we consider here , also the @xmath41@xmath42 contribution interferes constructively with the sm contribution .",
    "the second point regards the composition of the lightest chargino , i.e. whether the gaugino or higgsino component prevails .",
    "this is crucial since the light stop is predominantly @xmath45 and , hence , if the lightest chargino is mainly a wino , it couples to @xmath45 mostly through the @xmath46 mixing in the stop sector .",
    "consequently , a suppression in the contribution to box diagrams going as @xmath47 is present ( @xmath48 denotes the mixing angle between the lighter and heavier stops ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lightest chargino is predominantly a higgsino ( i.e. @xmath49 in the chargino mass matrix ) , then the @xmath41lighter @xmath42 contribution grows . in this case , contributions @xmath50 become negligible and , moreover , it can be shown that they are independent on the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "a detailed study is provided in reference @xcite .",
    "for instance , for @xmath51 , they find that the inclusion of the susy contribution to the box diagrams doubles the usual sm contribution for values of the lighter @xmath42 mass up to @xmath52@xmath53 gev , using @xmath54 , @xmath55 tev , @xmath56 gev and the mass of the heavier @xmath57 of 250 gev",
    ". however , if @xmath58 is pushed up to 300 gev , the @xmath41@xmath42 loop yields a contribution which is roughly 3 times less than in the case @xmath56 gev , hence leading to negligible departures from the sm expectation . in the cases where the susy contributions are sizeable , one obtains relevant restrictions on the @xmath59 and @xmath60 parameters of the ckm matrix by making a fit of the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 of the ckm matrix and of the total loop contribution to the experimental values of @xmath30 and @xmath61 .",
    "for instance , in the above  mentioned case in which the susy loop contribution equals the sm @xmath37@xmath44 loop , hence giving a total loop contribution which is twice as large as in the pure sm case , combining the @xmath30 and @xmath61 constraints leads to a region in the @xmath59@xmath60 plane with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , excluding negative values of @xmath59 .    in conclusion",
    ", the situation concerning cp violation in the mssm case with @xmath29 and exact universality in the soft  breaking sector can be summarized in the following way : the mssm does not lead to any significant deviation from the sm expectation for cp  violating phenomena as @xmath64 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and cp violation in @xmath2 physics ; the only exception to this statement concerns a small portion of the mssm parameter space where a very light @xmath42 ( @xmath65 gev ) and @xmath41 ( @xmath66 gev ) are present . in this latter particular situation ,",
    "sizeable susy contributions to @xmath30 are possible and , consequently , major restrictions in the @xmath59@xmath60 plane can be inferred .",
    "obviously , cp violation in @xmath2 physics becomes a crucial test for this mssm case with very light @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "interestingly enough , such low values of susy masses are at the border of the detectability region at lep ii .    in next section",
    ", we will move to the case where , still keeping the minimality of the model , we switch on the new cp violating phases . later",
    "on we will give up also the strict minimality related to the absence of new flavor structure in the susy breaking sector and we will see that , in those more general contexts , we can expect susy to significantly depart from the sm predictions in cp violating phenomena .",
    "we have seen in the previous section that in any mssm there are additional phases which can cause deviations from the predictions of the sm in cp violation experiments .",
    "in fact , in the cmssm , there are already two new phases present , eq.([cmssmphases ] ) , and for most of the mssm parameter space , the experimental bounds on the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the electron and neutron constrain these phases to be at most @xmath67 . however , in the last few years , the possibility of having non  zero susy phases has again attracted a great deal of attention .",
    "several new mechanisms have been proposed to suppress supersymmetric contributions to edms below the experimental bounds while allowing susy phases @xmath68 .",
    "methods of suppressing the edms consist of cancellation of various susy contributions among themselves @xcite , non universality of the soft breaking parameters at the unification scale @xcite and approximately degenerate heavy sfermions for the first two generations @xcite . in the presence of one of these mechanisms ,",
    "large supersymmetric phases are naturally expected and edms should be generally close to the experimental bounds .    in this section we will study the effects of these phases in cp violation observables as @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath69 cp asymmetries . following our work of ref .",
    "@xcite it is clear that the presence of large susy phases is not enough to produce sizeable supersymmetric contributions to these observables .",
    "in fact , _ in the absence of the ckm phase , a general mssm with all possible phases in the soft  breaking terms , but no new flavor structure beyond the usual yukawa matrices , can never give a sizeable contribution to @xmath30 , @xmath31 or hadronic @xmath69 cp asymmetries_. however , we will see in the next section , that as soon as one introduces some new flavor structure in the soft susy  breaking sector , even if the cp violating phases are flavor independent , it is indeed possible to get sizeable cp contribution for large susy phases and @xmath70 .",
    "then , we can rephrase our sentence above in a different way : _ a new result in hadronic @xmath69 cp asymmetries in the framework of supersymmetry would be a direct proof of the existence of a completely new flavor structure in the soft  breaking terms_. this means that @xmath2factories will probe the flavor structure of the supersymmetry soft  breaking terms even before the direct discovery of the supersymmetric partners @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : flavor - blind ] , we have shown that cp violation effects are always small in models with flavor blind soft  breaking terms . however , as soon as one introduces some new flavor structure in the soft breaking sector , it is indeed possible to get sizeable cp contribution for large susy phases and @xmath70 @xcite . to show this",
    ", we will mainly concentrate in new supersymmetric contributions to @xmath31 .    in the cmssm ,",
    "the susy contribution to @xmath31 is small @xcite .",
    "however in a mssm with a more general framework of flavor structure it is relatively easy to obtain larger susy effects to @xmath31 . in ref . @xcite it was shown that such large susy contributions arise once one assumes that : i ) hierarchical quark yukawa matrices are protected by flavor symmetry , ii ) a generic dependence of yukawa matrices on polonyi / moduli fields is present ( as expected in many supergravity / superstring theories ) , iii ) the cabibbo rotation originates from the down  sector and iv ) the phases are of order unity .",
    "in fact , in @xcite , it was illustrated how the observed @xmath31 could be mostly or entirely due to the susy contribution .    the universality of the breaking is a strong assumption and is known not to be true in many supergravity and string inspired models @xcite . in these models , we expect at least some non  universality in the squark mass matrices or tri  linear terms at the supersymmetry breaking scale . hence , sizeable flavor  off - diagonal entries will appear in the squark mass matrices . in this regard , gluino contributions to @xmath31 are especially sensitive to @xmath71 ; even @xmath72 gives a significant contribution to @xmath31 while keeping the contributions from this mi to @xmath73 and @xmath30 well bellow the phenomenological bounds .",
    "the situation is the opposite for @xmath74@xmath74 and @xmath11@xmath11 mass insertions ; the stringent bounds on @xmath75 and @xmath76 from @xmath73 and @xmath30 prevent them to contribute significantly to @xmath31 .",
    "the lr squark mass matrix has the same flavor structure as the fermion yukawa matrix and both , in fact , originate from the superpotential couplings .",
    "it may be appealing to invoke the presence of an underlying flavor symmetry restricting the form of the yukawa matrices to explain their hierarchical forms .",
    "then , the lr mass matrix is expected to have a very similar form as the yukawa matrix .",
    "indeed , we expect the components of the lr mass matrix to be roughly the susy breaking scale ( e.g. , the gravitino mass ) times the corresponding component of the quark mass matrix .",
    "however , there is no reason for them to be simultaneously diagonalizable based on this general argument . to make an order of magnitude estimate",
    ", we take the down quark mass matrix for the first and second generations to be ( following our assumption iii ) ) , @xmath77 where the ( 2,1 ) element is unknown due to our lack of knowledge on the mixings among right  handed quarks ( if we neglect small terms @xmath78 ) . based on the general considerations on the lr mass matrix above",
    ", we expect @xmath79 where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 are constants of order unity . unless @xmath83 exactly , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are not simultaneously diagonalizable and we find @xmath86 it turns out that , following the simplest implementation along the lines of the above described idea , the amount of flavor changing lr mass insertion in the s and d  squark propagator results to roughly saturate the bound from @xmath31 if a susy phase of order unity is present @xcite",
    ".    this line of work has received a great deal of attention in recent times , after the last experimental measurements of @xmath31 in ktev and na31 @xcite .",
    "the effects of non ",
    "universal @xmath6 terms in cp violation experiments were previously analyzed by abel and frere @xcite and after this new measurement discussed in many different works @xcite . in the following",
    "we show a complete realization of the above masiero ",
    "murayama ( mm ) mechanism from a type i string  derived model recently presented by one of the authors @xcite .      in first place",
    "we explain our starting model , which is based on type i string models . our purpose is to study explicitly cp violation effects in models with non ",
    "universal gaugino masses and @xmath6terms .",
    "type i models can realize such initial conditions .",
    "these models contain nine  branes and three types of five  branes ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) . here",
    "we assume that the gauge group @xmath89 is on a 9brane and the gauge group @xmath90 on the @xmath91brane like in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to get non ",
    "universal gaugino masses between @xmath92 and @xmath90 .",
    "we call these branes the @xmath92brane and the @xmath90brane , respectively . 0.25 cm    chiral matter fields correspond to open strings spanning between branes .",
    "thus , they must be assigned accordingly to their quantum numbers .",
    "for example , the chiral field corresponding to the open string between the @xmath92 and @xmath90 branes has non  trivial representations under both @xmath92 and @xmath90 , while the chiral field corresponding to the open string , which starts and ends on the @xmath92brane , should be an @xmath90singlet . 0.25 cm there is only one type of the open string that spans between the 9 and 5branes , that we denote as the @xmath93 .",
    "however , there are three types of open strings which start and end on the 9brane , that is , the @xmath94 sectors ( i=1,2,3 ) , corresponding to the @xmath95th complex compact dimension among the three complex dimensions .",
    "if we assign the three families to the different @xmath94 sectors we obtain non  universality in the right  handed sector . notice that , in this model , we can not derive non ",
    "universality for the squark doublets , i.e. the left  handed sector . in particular",
    ", we assign the @xmath96 sector to the third family and the @xmath97 and @xmath98 , to the first and second families , respectively .",
    "0.25 cm    under the above assignment of the gauge multiplets and the matter fields , soft susy breaking terms are obtained , following the formulae in ref .",

    "@xmath103 is the gravitino mass , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the cp phases of the f  terms of the dilaton field @xmath106 and the three moduli fields @xmath107 , and @xmath108 and @xmath109 are goldstino angles , and we have the constraint , @xmath110 . 0.25 cm thus , if quark fields correspond to different @xmath94 sectors , we have non  universal a  terms .",

    "the dominant effect in the tri  linear terms renormalization is due to the gluino mass which produces the well  known alignment among a  terms and gaugino phases .",
