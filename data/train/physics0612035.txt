    "<S> more generally one could and indeed should consider alternative `` encoders , '' so as to choose one best suited for the problem at hand .    </S>",

    "<S> our method selects a division that differs by only one node from the division along which the actual dolphin groups were observed to split . </S>",
    "<S> because it is computationally infeasible to check all possible partitions of even modestly - sized networks , we use simulated annealing with the heat - bath algorithm to search for the partition that maximizes the mutual information between the description and the original network . we have confirmed the results for the networks in the figures with exhaustive searches in the vicinity of the monte carlo solutions .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with the partition obtained by using the modularity approach introduced by newman and girvan in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; that technique has been widely adopted because of its appealing simplicity , its performance in benchmark tests @xcite , and the availability of powerful numerical techniques for dealing with large networks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given a partitioning into @xmath9 modules , the modularity @xmath27 is the sum of the contributions from each module @xmath14 @xmath28 where @xmath25 is the number of links between nodes in the @xmath14-th module , @xmath29 the total degree in module @xmath14 , and @xmath6 is the total number of links in the network . </S>",
    "<S> when we maximize the modularity , we are not just minimizing the number of links between modules . </S>",
    "<S> instead we find a configuration which maximizes the number of links within modules in the actual network , minus the expected number of links within comparable modules in a random network with the same degree sequence @xcite . or equivalently , we aim to divide the network such that the number of links within modules is higher than expected .    </S>",
    "<S> this approach works beautifully for networks where the modules are similar in size and degree sequence @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the dolphin network in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] is partitioned using the modularity approach , the network ends up being divided very differently from the empirically observed fission of the dolphin group . </S>",
    "<S> why ? </S>",
    "<S> because of the @xmath30 denominator in the second term of the definition of modularity ( eq .  [ moularity ] ) , the choice of partition is highly sensitive to the total number of links in the system . by construction , </S>",
    "<S> the benefit function that defines modularity favors groups with similar total degree , which means that the size of a module depends on the size of the whole network @xcite .    the dolphin network by @xcite partitioned with our cluster - based compression ( solid line ) and based on the modularity ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stars and circles represent the two observed groups of dolphins . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite splits the network in the same way as our cluster - based compression method @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> to compare quantitatively the performance of our cluster - based compression method with modularity - based approaches , we conducted the benchmark tests described in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in these tests , </S>",
    "<S> 128 nodes are divided into four equally sized groups with average degree 16 . </S>",
    "<S> as the average number of links @xmath31 from each node to nodes in other groups increases , it becomes harder and harder to identify the underlying group structure .    </S>",
    "<S> table [ table ] presents the results from both methods using the simulated - annealing scheme described above for the numerical search ; we obtained comparable results for networks with up to @xmath32 nodes . </S>",
    "<S> when the groups are of equal size and similar total degree , both methods perform very well , on par with the best results reported in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when the groups vary in size or in total degree , as was the case in the dolphin network , the modularity approach has more difficulty resolving the community structure ( table [ table ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we merged three of the four groups in the benchmark test to form a series of test networks each with one large group of 96 nodes and one small group with 32 nodes . </S>",
    "<S> these asymmetrically - sized networks are harder for either approach to resolve , but cluster - based compression recovers the underlying community structure more often than does modularity , by a sizable margin . </S>",

    "<S> we will know a priori how many modules compose our sample network , but in general the task of resolving community structure is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> we must determine the number of modules in the network , and then we need to partition the nodes into that number of modules . </S>",
    "<S> the catch is that we can not determine the optimal number of modules without also considering the assignments of nodes  so these problems need to be solved simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> below , we provide a solution grounded in algorithmic information theory .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the encoder seeks to find a compression of the network so that the decoder can make the best possible estimate of the actual network . </S>",
    "<S> one approach would be to have the encoder partition the network into @xmath5 modules , one for each node . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that the decoder can reconstruct the network completely , but under this approach nothing is gained either in compression or module identification . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the encoder must balance the amount of information necessary to describe the network in modular form , as given by the signal @xmath1 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , and the uncertainty that remains once the decoder receives the modular description , as given by the size of the set of network estimates @xmath2 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this is an optimal coding problem and can be resolved by the minimum description length ( mdl ) principle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to exploit the regularities in the structure of the actual network @xmath0 to summarize it in condensed form , without overfitting it . </S>",
    "<S> what do we mean by overfitting in this context ? </S>",

    "<S> we want to choose a set of modules for the journal citation network in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] such that if we were to repeat the experiment next year , each journal would likely be assigned to the same module again . if we overfit the data , we may capture more of a specific year s data , but unwittingly we also capture noise that will not recur in next year s data .    </S>",
    "<S> to minimize the description length of the original network @xmath0 , we look for the number of modules @xmath9 that minimizes that the length of the modular description @xmath1 plus the `` conditional description length '' , where the conditional description length is the amount of additional information that would be needed to specify @xmath0 exactly to a receiver who had already decoded the description @xmath1 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we seek to minimize the sum @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the length in bits of the signal and @xmath36 is number of bits needed to specify which of the network estimates implied by the signal @xmath1 is actually realized . </S>",
    "<S> the description length is easy to calculate in this discrete case and is given by @xmath37 where the first and second term give the size necessary to encode the assignment vector @xmath10 and the module matrix @xmath38 , and @xmath23 is given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ zentropy ] . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig3]b shows the description length with the journal network partitioned into one to five modules . four modules yield the minimum description length and we show the corresponding partition in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this cluster - based compression assigns 39 of the 40 journals into the proper categories , but places the central hub _ physical review letters _ ( prl ) in the chemistry cluster . </S>",
    "<S> this may seem like a mistake , given that prl has 9 links to physics and only 8 to chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a partitioning based on the modularity score @xmath27 places prl among the physics journals . </S>",
    "<S> but whatever its subject matter , the structural role that prl plays in the unweighted journal network is that of a chemistry journal . like most of the chemistry journals , and unlike its compatriots in physics , prl </S>",
    "<S> is closely linked to biology and somewhat connected to ecology .    </S>",
    "<S> we can also partition the network into two , three , or five modules , but doing so yields a longer total description length . </S>",
    "<S> when we compress the network into two components , physics clusters together with chemistry and biology clusters together with ecology . </S>",
    "<S> when we split into three components , ecology and biology separate but physics and chemistry remain together in a single module . </S>",
    "<S> when we try to split the network into five modules , we get essentially the same partition as with four , only with the singly connected journal _ conservation biology </S>",
    "<S> _ split off by itself into its own partition . </S>",
    "<S> one might not even consider that singleton to be a valid module .    to get a sense of how different methods handle the model selection problem , we compared the performance of our cluster - based compression method with the modularity - based approach . instead of looking for the best assignment given the correct number of modules as in table [ table ] , </S>",
    "<S> we look at the performance of each method at estimating the correct number of modules . </S>",
    "<S> our results are summarized in table [ table2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> both cluster - based compression and modularity exhibit thresholds beyond which they are unable with high probability to reconstruct the underlying module structure that generated the data . beyond this threshold , the compression method tends to underestimate the number of groups . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the modularity tends to overestimate the number of groups . </S>",
