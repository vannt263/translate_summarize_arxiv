    "the crumpling of a thin sheet can be understood as the condensation of elastic energy into a network of two types of singular structures : folding ridges and point - like vertices . scaling laws governing the energy and size of the ridge have been obtained analytically and tested numerically [ 2 - 5 ] .",

    "it is useful to express the deflection of the sheet by @xmath3 . due to the constraint of unstretchability ,",
    "some part of the sheet is buckled inwardly and the sheet deforms into a non - axisymmetric conical surface that is only in partial contact with the edge of the container ( fig .  [ shape ] ) , thus forming a single developable cone .    in the limit of pure bending ,",
    "that is , as thickness goes to zero , the shape of @xmath0-cone has been shown to follow the solutions of the _ elastica _ equation @xcite .",
    "for asymptoticaly small deformation @xmath4 , the shape can be analytically determined : this indicates that the buckled region occupies a fixed azimuthal angle of @xmath5 , independent of all relevant length scales @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , for a physical sheet with finite thickness @xmath6 , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , stretching must occur and the stretching energy is concentrated in a small core region near the pushing tip . outside this core region , bending energy strongly predominates over stretching energy .",
    "et al _ @xcite propose that the size of the core region scales as @xmath7 .",
    "this scaling law was verified by our numerical simulations through direct geometrical measurements and through inferences from the measurements of central pushing force @xcite .",
    "however , our analytical estimates indicate that this scaling can not by asymptotic . away from the core region ,",
    "the confining normal forces from the edge of the cylindrical container arise from the requirement to counteract the central pushing force . in the situation of pure bending , cerda and",
    "mahadevan @xcite predict that the sheet exerts a concentrated point force to the container at the two take - off points where the sheet bends away from the container . due to the translational symmetry along the region of the surface in contact with the container , the normal force",
    "is found to be independent of the azimuthal angle .",
    "the problem of interest here is the response of the sheet to these azimuthally constant normal forces from the edge of the container . through our numerical study",

    "is introduced by assigning an energy of @xmath11 to every pair of adjacent triangles with normals @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "the shape of the sheet in our simulation is a regular hexagon of side length @xmath1 .",
    "the typical value of @xmath1 is @xmath18 .    to obtain a single @xmath0-cone shape , we need to simulate the constraining container edge and pushing force . as shown in fig .",
    "[ shape ] , the edge lies in the @xmath19 plane and is described by equation @xmath20 . pushing in the center of the sheet",
    "is accomplished by introducing a repulsive potential of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the @xmath8 coordinate of the lattice point in the center and @xmath23 is the magnitude of the pushing force .",
    "this force is applied in the positive @xmath8 direction . the constraining edge is implemented by a potential of the form",

    "we choose the range @xmath25 of the potential to be one lattice spacing .",
    "thus the force decays rapidly once the lattice points go away from the edge .",
    "a discussion concerning the choices of the edge potential form is carried out in section v.    the conjugate gradient algorithm @xcite is used to minimize the total elastic and potential energy of the system as a function of the coordinates of all lattice points .",
    "this lattice model behaves like a continuum material provided that the curvatures are everywhere much smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "this limitation restricts the values of deflection @xmath4 of @xmath0-cone to be below 0.25 .",
    "we determine the curvatures approximately from each triangle in the sheet . for this measurement",
    ", we take the curvature tensor to be constant across each triangle .",
    "we calculate it using the relative heights of the six vertices of the three triangles that share sides with the given triangle @xcite .",

    "lobkovsky @xcite numerically verified the `` virial theorem '' for ridges that bending energy is five times the stretching energy , for asymptotically thin sheets . in the study of @xmath0-cone , the ratio of the normal force from the @xmath40-function term to that from the angle - independent term",
    "is found to be 0.70 numerically @xcite , compared well with the theoretical prediction 0.69 @xcite .",

    "the torques are proportional to curvatures through a constitutive law implicit in the energy equations @xcite:@xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the bending modulus and @xmath67 is the poisson ratio . using these laws to eliminate torques from the force von  equation ,",

    "therefore , the azimuthal stress is compressive in the buckled region but tensile in the unbuckled region .",
    "cerda and mahadevan @xcite show that for the same shape formed under a conical support , unlike a @xmath0-cone formed under a ring support as illustrated above , the azimuthal stress in the unbuckled region is compressive due to the exertion of normal pressure everywhere . in our case , the tensile azimuthal stress in the unbuckled region",
    "is changed to be compressive only near the edge of container , where the normal forces are nonzero .",
    "whether the stresses are tensile or compressive , their magnitude goes as @xmath73 .",
    "we call them type i stresses and denote them by symbol @xmath74 .",
    "it is noted that the type i stresses exist both in azimuthal and radial directions .",
    "having looked at the local normal force balance of the surface , we now investigate the global force balance .",
    "we consider a region that encloses area between inner radius @xmath75 and outer radius @xmath43 , where @xmath43 can take values between @xmath75 and @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath75 denotes the size of the stretching core region .",
    "the tension exerted on the inner edge of this region is equivalent to the central pushing force of a regular @xmath0-cone .",
    "this force must be balanced by the force due to radial in - plane stress @xmath76 on the outer perimeter of the region .",
    "let @xmath77 be the angle between a radial line or generator of the @xmath0-cone and the horizontal .",
    "since @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 . the balance of vertical forces yields _ rr r d = f  , [ above ] which holds for every value of @xmath43 from @xmath75 to @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that the type i stresses alone ca nt satisfy this equation , since they go as @xmath73 , they would give a @xmath42 prefactor on the left side of equation , while the right - side of equation is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the integral from type i stresses must vanish and there must exist some additional tensile stresses in the outer region that scale as @xmath42 to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ above ] ) .",
    "we call these stresses as type ii stresses and denote them by @xmath80 .",
    "they persist up to the supporting container edge , where normal force from the container counteracts the external pushing force .",
    "we can write @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is a function only of @xmath68 and satisfies @xmath83 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath82 is of order unity . to estimate the magnitude of type ii stresses , we notice that @xmath84 .",
    "thus @xmath85 .",
    "the type ii stresses are comparable with type i stresses only near the container edge since the ratio @xmath86 for @xmath87 .    now that we see that the contacting normal force and the stresses seem to matter , we vary the system in ways that alter them . for this purpose ,",
    "we study several geometries that we call the cut cone , regular cone , puckered cylinder and elliptical @xmath0-cone , and compare them with regular @xmath0-cone .",
    "first , to study the effect of stresses , we cut the sheet along a radial line and push it into the same container to form a `` cut cone '' . now that the boundaries along the cut line are free to move , the buckled region no longer appears and the sheet will necessarily overlap itself in order to fit into the container , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ shape_cutcone ] .",
    "the cut cone mostly follows a conical shape as the unbuckled region of @xmath0-cone does , indicating that the azimuthal tensile stress remains the same as @xmath0-cone . near the free boudaries",
    ", however , the sheet deviates from a conical shape and does not contact against the confining edge . instead",
    ", there is a section of the sheet near the free boundaries that has less curvature than the corresponding @xmath0-cone shape , due to the lack of bending moment there .",
    "consequently , the free boundaries contact the container at a nonzero angle and the azimuthal stresses arise from the pushing force from the edge . due to the decreases in the energies ,",
    "the pushing force is reduced by a finite factor relative to that of @xmath0-cone .",
    "this causes the radial tensile stress to be reduced by the same factor .",
    "numerically , it is found that the pushing force is reduced by about one order of magnitude .",
    "the measurements of the mean curvature along radial lines show rather small decreases in the contacting region , far from enough to make mean curvature vanish .",
    "these contrasts to the @xmath0-cone show that the appropriate amount of radial stress in the @xmath0-cone may play an important role for the mean curvature to vanish .",
    "next , we make a regular cone by removing one sixty - degree sector of the hexagon and joining the two free sides ( see fig .",
    "[ shape_realcone ] ) .",
    "we then push this regular cone into the same container as before , and measure the corresponding radial profile of mean curvature .",
    "the cone does not buckle for the range of forces we consider .",
    "we find that as we push with the similar force as that required for a @xmath0-cone of the same thickness and deformation , we observe the similar feature of vanishing mean curvature near @xmath88 .",
    "to illustrate this point , fig .",
    "[ threeforce ] shows the radial profiles of mean curvature of a regular cone pushed with three different forces against the confining edge .",
    "the pluses , circles and triangles are for a regular cone pushed by half of the corresponding @xmath0-cone force , one @xmath0-cone force and twice the @xmath0-cone force , respectively .",
    "we observe that the mean curvature vanishes as we push with one @xmath0-cone force , while it is not vanishing for half @xmath0-cone force and is changing sign for double @xmath0-cone force .",
    "when the central pushing force is similar , the normal forces from the edge are similar for regular cone and @xmath0-cone .",
    "so are the azimuthal compressive stresses induced by them in the contacting region .",
    "these facts show that the pushing force required to make @xmath0-cone is somehow just enough to produce the right amount of stresses for which the induced radial curvature cancels original azimuthal curvature .         and deformation @xmath89 .",

    ", we replace the cylindrical confining surface with a circular ring of the same radius . now that the puckered cylindrical sheet is confined by the ring and",
    "the ring exerts normal forces on the sheet , we expect the mean curvature to be reduced in the contacting region where the sheet touches the confining ring . the simulated shape is shown in fig .  [ puckered_shape ] .",
    "we measure the mean curvature along a longitudinal line parallel to the axis of cylinder .",
    "a small drop of mean curvature is observed where the sheet touches the ring .",
    "not surprisingly , the reduction of mean curvature goes up as the ratio @xmath91 increases .",
    "however , we find that the drop is no more than 10% for various values of @xmath2 and @xmath92 that can produce reasonable confined shape , even for @xmath93 .",
    "the reason that the mean curvature does nt vanish near the contacting region is attributed to the absence of stess in the non - azimuthal direction . by contrast",
    ", the @xmath0-cone has a radial tensile stress which transmits the central force to the container .",
    "lastly , we observe that the circular symmetry is important for cancellation of mean curvature . to see this ,",
    "an elliptical confining edge is used instead of a circular edge .",
    "our original hexagonal sheet is pushed against this elliptical edge .",
    "the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse are @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , with @xmath9 being the lattice spacing in the numerical model .",
    "[ ellipse ] shows mean curvature profiles in two different radial directions , both of which lie within the unbuckled region of the sheet .",
    "one profile is measured along a major axis of the elliptical edge .",
    "the other profile is measured along the lattice direction sixty degrees from the first and thus meets the ellipse close to the minor axis . for the sake of uniform comparison , we measured curvatures only along principal lattice directions .",

    "the induced radial curvature is greater than the azimuthal curvature in magnitude , thus overcompensating the azimuthal curvature .",

    "to demonstrate that our numerically observed phenomenon occurs also in physical sheets , a crude experiment was performed .",
    "first , we made a @xmath0-cone by pushing a reflective plastic sheet into a circular container of radius 9.1 cm .",
    "the sheet is a an ordinary 22 cm @xmath96 28 cm projection transparency used in presentations .",
    "its thickness is about 0.1 mm .",
    "we measured the curvature profile of this sheet by observing the images of standard objects reflected in the sheet .",
    "the magnification of each object allows us to infer the curvature at the corresponding position on the @xmath0-cone .",

    "the images of the circles are turned into ellipses that are progressively wider in the azimuthal direction as they approach the vertex , since the azimuthal curvature is inversely proportional to the distance to the vertex . in the noncontacting region ,",
    "the images all have the same height in the radial direction , since radial curvature is zero there .",
    "however , the image on the edge is different .",
    "it is being contracted in the radial direction due to the induced radial curvature there .",
    "if the radial curvature is of the same magnitude as azimuthal curvature at the edge , the contraction in the radial direction and the expansion in the azimuthal direction have to be by the same factor .",
    "let @xmath33 be the azimuthal size and @xmath97 be the radial size of the image , then the @xmath98 ratio for the image at the edge has to be the square of that ratio for the image just outside or inside the edge .",

    "our results for elliptical container suggest that it is some average mean curvature along the rim that vanishes .",

    "<S> in this paper we report numerically observed spontaneous vanishing of mean curvature on a developable cone made by pushing a thin elastic sheet into a circular container @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this feature is independent of thickness of the sheet , the supporting radius and the amount of deflection . </S>",
    "<S> several variants of developable cone are studied to examine the necessary conditions that lead to the vanishing of mean curvature . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the presence of appropriate amount of radial stress is necessary . </S>",
    "<S> the developable cone geometry somehow produces the right amount of radial stress to induce just enough radial curvature to cancel the conical azimuthal curvature . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the circular symmetry of supporting container edge plays an important role . with an elliptical supporting edge , the radial curvature overcompensates the azimuthal curvature near the minor axis and undercompensates near the major axis . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical finding is verified by a crude experiment using a reflective plastic sheet . </S>",
    "<S> we expect this finding to have broad importance in describing the general geometrical properties of forced crumpling of thin sheets . </S>"
