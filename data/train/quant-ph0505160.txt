    "joint measurements play an important role in quantum information processing(qip ) . in quantum teleportation",
    ", an unknown quantum state will be sent from sender to receiver via a quantum channel with the help of classical communication . during this process",
    ", the sender will operate a joint bell - state measurement on the unknown - state particle and one of the entangled particles she possesses  @xcite . in entanglement swapping , there are usually three spatially separate users , and two of them have shared one pair of entangled particles with the third user . then the third user will operate a joint bell - state measurement on the two particles he possesses . corresponding to the measurement result ,",
    "the two particles possessed by the two spatially separate users will collapse into an entangled state without any entanglement before the joint measurement  @xcite . in remote state preparation  @xcite , if we want to prepare some entangled state remotely via two pairs of entangled particles as the quantum channel , the joint measurement is also a necessity  @xcite . like the above - mentioned entanglement swapping ,",
    "there are usually three spatially separate users , and two of them have shared one pair of entangled particles with the third user . then the third user user will operate a special type of joint measurement , which corresponds to the entangled state the third user want to prepare remotely , on the two particles he possesses . after the third user informs the first or the second user the measurement results , the particles of the first and the second user are prepared in the entangled state that the third user want to prepare remotely . in addition , joint measurements are also needed in the quantum dense coding  @xcite .",
    "the sender and the receiver share an entangled pairs , and the sender will encode the 2-bit classical information on the entangled particle he possesses by operating four possible single - bit operations on the particle . then this particle(one qubit ) will be sent to the receiver .",
    "the receiver will operate a joint bell - state measurement on the two particles to decode the 2-bit classical information the sender encoded .    form the above analysis ,",
    "joint measurements are needed in quantum teleportation , entanglement swapping , remote preparation of entangled state via two pairs of entangled particles as the quantum channel and quantum dense coding , etc .",
    "but it is very difficult to realize joint measurements in experiment .",
    "usually , joint measurements will be converted into the product of separate measurements on single particle  @xcite . for the photon case ,",
    "teleportation of unknown polarization state of photons has been realized in experiment  @xcite , where the joint bell - state measurement has been converted into the product of separate measurements on single photon by using the linear optical elements , such as polarization beam splitters and photon detectors .",
    "but in this experimental scheme , the four bell states can not be discriminated conclusively and completely .",
    "so zhao _ et al _ proposed an alternative scheme for the conclusive discrimination of the four bell states of photons with the help of the ancillary entangled pairs of photons  @xcite . in cavity qed domain",
    ", the bell - state measurement on atoms has been converted into the separate measurements on single atom by using the controlled - not ( c - not ) gate operations  @xcite , where the dispersive interaction between two atoms and a cavity mode plays an important role . to avoid the difficulty of the c - not gate operations , zheng and ye all proposed the schemes to teleport an unknown atomic state without bell - state measurement , and the interaction between atoms and cavity modes decomposes the bell states into product states .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", bell - state measurements have been realized for the photon case .",
    "however , because it is difficult to realize bell - state measurements for atomic ( ionic ) states in experiment  @xcite , the implementation of quantum teleportation  @xcite , entanglement swapping , remote preparation of entangled state and quantum dense coding for atomic ( ionic ) states are all not easy . in our previous contribution , we have proposed the entanglement swapping scheme for atomic system without joint measurement  @xcite , where the interaction ( resonant and nonresnant cases ) between atoms and cavity modes replaces the bell - state analyzer .",
    "but , due to the complexity of the cavity qed techniques , it is difficult to realize these schemes in experiment .",
    "so , in this paper , we will propose an alternative scheme for some quantum information processes for ions , such as , quantum teleportation , entanglement concentration via entanglement swapping and remote preparation of entangled states , etc .",
    "we will use the linear optical elements .",
    "the main setup of the scheme is a mach - zehnder interferometers ( mzi ) with two ions placed on the two arms of the mzi",
    ". we can decide whether the scheme succeed or not by operating single photon measurements on the two output ports of the mzi .",
    "the unique advantage of the current scheme is that the quantum information processing for ions can be realized by using linear optical elements , which decreases the difficulty of the experimental implementation .",
    "in addition , by using the mzi , the joint measurement are all decomposed into single photon measurements and single ion measurements , so the current scheme avoids the difficulty of realizing joint measurements .",
    "consider the three - level ionic system , where @xmath0 are two degenerate metastable states of ions , and @xmath1 is the excited state .",
    "the level configuration of the ions is depicted in fig.[level ] .",
    "level configuration of the ions used in the scheme . the ions , which are in the degenerate states @xmath0 , can be excited into the unstable excited state @xmath1 by absorbing one @xmath2 polarized photon , then it can decay to the stable ground state @xmath3 with a scattered photon rapidly . ]",
    "the ions can be excited from @xmath4 to the excited states @xmath1 by absorbing one @xmath2 circular polarization photon with unit efficiency . because the excited state @xmath1 is not a stable one , the ions in that state will decay rapidly to the stable ground state @xmath3 with a scattered photon @xmath5 .",
    "this process can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath6    suppose the unknown state of ion 1 to be teleported is : @xmath7 are normalization coefficients , and @xmath8 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that @xmath9 are all real numbers .",
    "before teleportation , the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) share a maximally entangled pair of ions 2 , 3 : @xmath10 polarized photon will be superimposed on the mzi from the left lower input port .",
    "the main setup is depicted in fig.[setupfortele ] .     the setup for teleportation scheme .",
    "alice places ions 1 , 2 on the upper arm and lower arm of the mzi , respectively .",
    "one @xmath11 polarized photon will be superimposed on the first beam splitter ( bs@xmath12 ) .",
    "after the bs@xmath12 the photon will take two possible pathes ( _ u _ denotes the upper path and _ l _ denotes the lower one ) .",
    "reflected by two mirrors , the two possible pathes will be recombined at the second beam splitter ( bs@xmath13 ) .",
    "single photon detection will be operated on the two output ports of the mzi after the bs@xmath13 .",
    "if the right lower output port detector ( @xmath14 ) fires , the teleportation can succeed . ]",
    "the effect of the bs on the input photon can be expressed as :    [ effectofbs ] @xmath15 @xmath16    where @xmath17 denote the lower optical path and the upper optical path , respectively . @xmath18 denote two photons , and @xmath19 denotes the direction of polarization . from eq.([effectofbs ] ) we found that there will be a @xmath20 phase shift between the input photon and the reflected wave function , and the transparent part is synchronized with the input photon .",
    "the bs takes no effect on the polarization of the input photon . because the ions 1 , 2 have been placed on the two optical pathes ( _ u _ and _ l _ , respectively )",
    ", the ions will interact with the photon .",
    "the interaction will generate a shift of interference after the bs@xmath13 , then alice will detect the two output ports of the mzi to check whether the teleportation succeeds or not .",
    "these are critical to the teleportation and the other quantum information processes to be presented in the current scheme .    before teleportation the total state of the system",
    "is : @xmath21    to analyze the evolution of the total system , we will consider the evolution of the following four product states of ions 1 , 2 :    [ basicevolution ] @xmath22 @xmath23",
    "@xmath24 @xmath25    so , after the operation of mzi , the state of the total system will evolve into : @xmath26|m_{-}\\rangle_{3}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\beta[\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}|m_{-}\\rangle_{1}|s\\rangle_{2}|g\\rangle_{2}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}(a_{l,+}^{+}+ia_{u,+}^{+ } ) |0\\rangle|m_{-}\\rangle_{1}|m_{+}\\rangle_{2}]|m_{+}\\rangle_{3}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & i{\\beta}a_{u,+}^{+}|0\\rangle|m_{-}\\rangle_{1}|m_{-}\\rangle_{2}|m_{-}\\rangle_{3}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if the photon detector at the right lower output port @xmath14 fires , the state of the system collapse into : @xmath27 then alice will measure the ions 1 , 2 in the basis :    [ newbasis ] @xmath28 @xmath29    for the results @xmath30 , @xmath31 , the ion 3 will be left in the state @xmath32 , so a @xmath33 operation is needed to transfer the state of ion 3 to the state of ion 1 . for the results @xmath34 , @xmath35 ,",
    "the ion 3 will be left in the state @xmath36 , so a @xmath37 operation is needed to transfer the state of ion 3 to the state of ion 1 .",
    "the total success probability of the teleportation scheme is @xmath38 .",
    "although the successful probability is smaller than 1.0 , the current scheme does not need the joint bell - state measurement and the complex ion trap techniques , which will simplify the implementation of the scheme .",
    "the current scheme for the teleporation of one qubit unknown state can be generalized to the multi - qubit unknown state case in a straight forward way .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in other papers .",
    "suppose there are three spatially separate users alice , bob and cliff .",
    "alice and bob all share a pair of nonmaximally entangled ions with cliff .",
    "alice has access to ion 1 , bob has access to ion 4 , and ions 2 and 3 are all at cliff s location .",
    "the entangled state of ions 1 , 2 and the entangled state of ions 3 , 4 are :    [ channelforswapping ] @xmath39 @xmath40    where @xmath41 are normalization coefficients , and @xmath8 , @xmath42 . without loss of generality , we can assume that @xmath41 are all real numbers .    before swapping ,",
    "the state of the total system is : @xmath43 to construct entanglement between ion 1 and ion 4 , cliff will introduce the mzi as in section ii , and put the ions 2 , 3 on the upper and lower arm of the mzi , respectively .",
    "then one @xmath11 polarized photon will be superimposed on the mzi from the left lower input port . from the evolution in eq.([basicevolution ] ) , we can give the evolution caused by the mzi : @xmath44|m_{+}\\rangle_{1}|m_{-}\\rangle_{4}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & { \\beta}a[\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}|m_{-}\\rangle_{2}|s\\rangle_{3}|g\\rangle_{3}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{2}(a_{l,+}^{+}+ia_{u,+}^{+ } ) |0\\rangle|m_{-}\\rangle_{2}|m_{+}\\rangle_{3}]|m_{-}\\rangle_{1}|m_{+}\\rangle_{4}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & i{\\beta}ba_{u,+}^{+}|0\\rangle|m_{-}\\rangle_{2}|m_{-}\\rangle_{3}|m_{-}\\rangle_{1}|m_{-}\\rangle_{4}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then cliff will detect the two output ports of the mzi .",
    "if the photon detector at the right lower output port @xmath14 fires , the state of the total system will collapse into : @xmath45 if we let @xmath46 @xmath47 , the state in eq.([totalforswappingafterevolution ] ) becomes : @xmath48 which is a four - ion maximally entangled states . if cliff measures the ions 2 , 3 in the @xmath49 basis as in section ii , the ions 1 , 4 will be left in maximally entangled state @xmath50 for the results @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "if the results are @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the ions 1 , 4 will be left in the maximally entangled state @xmath55 .",
    "the total success probability is @xmath56 .",
    "so the two ions 1 , 4 , which have never interacted before , are left in an entangled state via entanglement swapping .",
    "furthermore , the initial nonmaximally entangled states in eq.([channelforswapping ] ) have been concentrated into a maximally entangled state via entanglement swapping  @xcite . in our previous contributions",
    "@xcite , we also realized the entanglement concentration via entanglement swapping in cavity qed , and the success probabilities of them are bigger than that of the current scheme .",
    "but , the current scheme uses the linear optical elements , which can be realized within the current technology easily . in addition , four - ion maximally entangled states can be generated in the current scheme . in one of our previous contributions , we used the similar setup , and realized the purification and concentration of nonmaximally entangled ionic states  @xcite .",
    "but two mzis have been used there . in our current scheme",
    ", the concentration can be realized by using the mzi only once .",
    "so the current scheme is more efficient than the previous one .",
    "in section iii , if cliff want to prepare an entangled state : @xmath57 ) in the basis @xmath58 :      where @xmath61 , @xmath62 . after the measurement ,",
    "the ions 1 , 4 will be left in different states corresponding to different measurement results . for results",
    "@xmath63 , @xmath64 , ions 1 , 4 will be left in maximally entangled state @xmath50 with probability @xmath65 . for the result @xmath66 , ions 1 , 4 will be left in the state in eq.([stateofrsp ] ) , i.e. the state cliff want to prepare remotely .",
    "the probability is @xmath67 . for the results @xmath68 ,",
    "ions 1 , 4 will be left in the state @xmath69 with probability @xmath67 .",
    "this state can be converted into the state in eq.([stateofrsp ] ) by operating @xmath37 operations on the two ions .",
    "so if ions 2 , 3 are measured in states @xmath66 , @xmath68 , the ions 1 , 4 will be prepared in the state in eq.([stateofrsp ] ) successfully with probability @xmath70 .",
    "compared with the previous scheme for the remote preparation of entangled states , the current scheme embeds the following advantages : ( 1 ) it does not need the joint measurement ; ( 2 ) it can realize the remote preparation of entangled state for ions by using linear optical elements . so it is simpler than the cavity qed or ion - trap schemes .    by far we have only discussed the idea case where we suppose that a photon impinging on an atom always leads to the process described in eq.([scattering ] ) .",
    "but in most case the photon will not be scattered by the ions , if the ions are placed inside the mzi .",
    "that would mean that detector at the right upper output port @xmath71 will most likely fire . to enhance the scattering rate ,",
    "an optical cavity will be added to enclose the mzi .",
    "the detailed description has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which indicates that this cavity will increase the success probability",
    ".    then we will consider the feasibility of the current scheme .",
    "as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , we can use @xmath72ca@xmath73 as the candidate ion for a possible implementation of the current scheme . @xmath74 and @xmath75 are two metastable levels of @xmath72ca@xmath73 with lifetimes of the order of @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath77 and @xmath78 are two sublevels of @xmath74 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and this two sublevels are coupled to @xmath1 by @xmath81 and @xmath82 light at @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 correspond to @xmath85 in fig.[level ] respectively .",
    "that is to say , we use the @xmath86 as stable ground state , @xmath87 as two degenerate metastable state and @xmath88 as excited state .",
    "arbitrary superposition state of this two degenerate metastable states can be realized by applying a laser pulse of appropriate length , which can be realized in a few microsecond  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72ca@xmath73 in state @xmath89 or @xmath90 can be excited into the excited state @xmath88 by applying one @xmath81 or @xmath82 light at @xmath83 .",
    "then decay from @xmath1 to @xmath87 , to @xmath75 and to @xmath86 are all possible .",
    "but refs .",
    "@xcite give the transition probability for @xmath91 as @xmath92s and the branching ratio of @xmath93 versus @xmath91 as 1:15 , while the branching ratio for @xmath94 versus @xmath95 can be estimated as 1:30 , giving @xmath96s for the transition probability .",
    "so in most case , the @xmath72ca@xmath73 in the excited state will decay into the stable ground state @xmath86 .",
    "the detection of the internal states of @xmath72ca@xmath73 can be realized by using a cycling transition between @xmath86 and @xmath97  @xcite .        from reference  @xcite",
    ", the probability @xmath99 for a photon to be emitted into the cavity mode after excitation to @xmath100 can be expressed as @xmath101 .",
    "where @xmath102 is the decay rate of the cavity , @xmath103 its finesse , @xmath104 its length , @xmath105 is the coupling constant between the transition and the cavity mode , @xmath106 the dipole element , @xmath107 the wavelength of the transition , @xmath108 the mode volume ( which can be made as small as @xmath109 for a confocal cavity with waist @xmath110 ) , and @xmath111 is the non - cavity related loss rate  @xcite .",

    "* coupling the photon out of the cavity will introduce another error expressed as @xmath119 , which can be modulated to be close to unit .",
