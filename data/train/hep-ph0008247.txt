    "besides existing machines and a whole bunch of data sets , further lepton pair colliders such as the next linear collider ( nlc ) and the future muon collider ( fmc ) are designed for the future .",
    "they will be able to determine the properties of heavy particles to an extend never reached by present colliders .",
    "especially they will be able to measure the properties of the top quark which was first measured at the tevatron with a mass of @xmath3 ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although the top quark will be studied at the lhc and the tevatron ( run - ii ) as well with an expected accuracy for the mass of @xmath4 , the measurements at nlc are expected to have an accuracy of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "theorists are therefore asked to improve their predictions , too .",
    "of special interest is the consideration of the cross section near the pair production threshold because the resonance observed there is constituted solely by a colour singlet state .",
    "a lot has been done in the past and just recently to calculate and match corresponding diagrams up to the next - to - next - to - leading order in order to determine this cross section ( for an overview on work that has been done see e.g.  ref .",
    "but the question remains what we actually want to determine .",
    "what can we say about the mass of a particle which never will show up in nature in isolated fashion because of its confinement ? does the term of _ the _ mass of the top quark really makes sense ?",
    "the everydays life of theorists show that this actually makes no sense .",
    "there are different concepts on the market  each of them with different advantages and disadvantages , regions of validy and failure .",
    "they all show that there can not be a unique definition of the quark mass .",
    "instead the task of the theory can only be to quantify and limit the theoretical uncertainties to an amount comparable to the experimental measurements .",
    "one of these theory - born uncertainties are special kinds of ir singularities known as renormalons which limit the accuracy of a prediction to the order of @xmath7 .",
    "just recently this problem has been overcome ( a synapsis of the progress is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and this talk will deal with the different concepts which were developed in this context , closing with an own suggestion presented by the authors  @xcite .",
    "a mass quite often used in perturbation theory is the @xmath8 mass .",
    "it is related to the bare mass of the underlying qcd by the calculation of self energy diagrams of the quark .",
    "the term @xmath8 mass indicates that for this calculation we use the @xmath8 subtraction scheme which itself is based on the dimensional regularization method .",
    "the calculation of self energy diagrams which is done actually up to the third order qcd perturbation theory  @xcite leads to a couple of master diagrams which are calculated at center - of - mass energies in the deep euklidean domain ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 large ) where the perturbation series converge sufficiently good .",
    "this @xmath8 mass of course does not fit the range around the threshold and spoils the non - relativistic expansion if applied . but the @xmath8 mass can be continued to this region .",
    "the continuation is done by the borel transformation .",
    "this transform can be understood as the extrapolation from the deep euklidean domain to the @xmath0 threshold domain where a simultaneous limit of the negative center - of - mass energy and the order of the used derivative is taken .",
    "the ratio of these two quantities remains fixed and constitutes the borel parameter .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this borel transformation can be made explicit for the case of the `` large @xmath11 limit '' where the prescription of brodsky , lepage and mackenzie  @xcite is used to sum up all fermion loop insertions ( being proportional to the zeroth order qcd beta function coefficient @xmath12 ) in order to obtain an estimate ( for a relation of this estimate to the @xmath8 mass see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "if we use the prescription for the static quark - antiquark potential @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath14 the borel transformation of this series expression leads to @xmath15 the series for the borel transformed quantity converges even if the perturbative series for @xmath13 itself is divergent .",
    "the inverse borel transformation @xmath16 provides then a good definition .",
    "however , there might occur singularities on the integration contour . as mentioned before , for the `` large @xmath11 ''",
    "estimate ( also known as `` naive non - abelianization '' ) we obtain an explicit expression @xmath17 which has simple poles for @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "these singularities are a special case of ir renormalons .",
    "the same happens then for the continuation of the @xmath8 mass to the on - shell mass in the threshold region .",
    "this on - shell mass is appropriate to the treatment near the threshold because the quark is then assumed to be nearly on - shell .",
    "the on - shell mass @xmath20 ( or pole mass as it is called more often ) can be determined by the demand that the inverse fermi propagator should vanish at this point , @xmath21 but the continuation of the @xmath8 mass via borel transformation to the pole mass leads again to ir renormalon ambiguities .",
    "so there is no way out ?",
    "wait , there is one ! both the pole mass and the static potential show an ir renormalon ambiguity .",
    "maybe they cancel in a specific combination of these two quantities ?",
    "indeed it emerges that in the combination @xmath22 the ir sensitivity vanishes . only for this reason it is then possible to construct a quantity which has no such ambiguities .",
    "in fact there are several of them , called threshold masses which we will deal with in the following .",
    "the first definition we want to mention here is the definition given by hoang and teubner  @xcite .",
    "we mention it first because it is the most sophisticated definition . starting with the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd )  @xcite , an effective theory designed to handle the non - relativistic quark - antiquark system which separates the low - momentum scales @xmath23 and @xmath24 from the high momentum scale @xmath20 ( @xmath25 is the velocity of the quark )",
    ", they stress the relevance of the different scales @xmath25 and @xmath26 and their interrelation . especially in the non - relativistic regime even the space and time components can be scaled differently .",
    "so there are `` soft '' ( @xmath27 ) , `` potential '' ( @xmath28 ) , and `` ultrasoft '' regions ( @xmath29 ) where the last one is populated only by gluons , not by quarks . if we separate the dynamical degrees of freedom also from the `` soft '' heavy quarks and gluons and the `` potential '' gluons , supplemented by an expansion in momentum components to the order @xmath24 , this leads to the construction of the `` potential nrqcd '' ( pnrqcd )  @xcite with the langrangian @xmath30 here the heavy quark - antiquark potential @xmath31 occurs , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the quark and antiquark spinors , respectively .",
    "finally the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite come to the conclusion that an adequate threshold mass definition is given by one half of the perturbative mass of a fictious toponium @xmath34 ground state .",
    "this threshold mass definition is referred to in the literature as @xmath35 mass .",
    "a second threshold mass definition is given by bigi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and is known by the name `` low scale '' ( ls ) mass .",
    "finally , beneke gave a definition which then led to the generalization suggested by us .",
    "the static potential subtracted ( ps ) mass  @xcite is the minimal version of a threshold mass . as the name tells us , the definition is given by combining ir singular parts taken from the static quark - antiquark potential with the pole mass in order to cancel out the ir sensitivity .",
    "starting point is the observation that the ir sensitive parts of the potential stem from long distance contributions , i.e.  small values of the three - momentum .",
    "if we therefore restrict the three - momentum range of the potential as expressed by the fourier transformation @xmath36 by @xmath37 , this results ( for the leading order coulomb potential ) in the contribution @xmath38 which restricts the accuracy .",
    "the way out is to use a potential @xmath39 defined by the fourier transformation with @xmath40 and to subsume the remaining part to the mass , @xmath41 ( it is legitimate to use @xmath42 here ) .",
    "the scale @xmath43 introduced by this is called _",
    "factorization scale_. it drops out again if the static ps mass is related to the @xmath8 mass .",
    "it has been pointed out already in ref .  @xcite that the replacement @xmath44 in the self energy leads to the leading infrared behaviour .",
    "we have taken this consideration as starting point for our definition and extended it to the more general non - static case .",
    "the general structure of the self energy diagram for an on - shell quark with mass @xmath20 and momentum @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the expression for this diagram",
    "is given by @xmath47 where the last factor is a non - commutative product with decreasing index @xmath48 .",
    "the line momenta @xmath49 are linear combinations of the gluon loop momenta @xmath50 , the particular representation is specified by the structure @xmath51 .",
    "the symbol @xmath52 means the set of all these loop momenta , the same symbol is used for the lorentz and colour indices . in general",
    "we have @xmath53 which means that line momenta can be correlated .",
    "the momenta of the virtual quark states are given by @xmath54 .",
    "the quark is considered to be at rest , @xmath55 , and it interacts with a number of gluons .",
    "the subdiagram @xmath51 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] describes the interaction between the gluons . in general the quark lines between the interaction points",
    "represent virtual quark states . however , if the virtual quark comes very close to the mass shell and the total momentum of the cloud of virtual gluons becomes soft , this situation gives rise to long - distance nonperturbative qcd interactions .",
    "the described ( virtual ) contributions results in the soft part of the self energy , @xmath56 .",
    "so we define @xmath57 one can derive this expression from eq .",
    "( [ def1 ] ) by using the identity @xmath58 and the fact that the principal value integral does not give any infrared sensitive contribution .",
    "the delta function can be used to remove the integration over the zero component of @xmath59 . in order to parameterize the softness of the gluon cloud",
    "we impose a cutoff on the spatial component , @xmath60 , and indicate this by the label @xmath43 for the factorization scale written at the upper limit of the three - dimensional integral .",
    "so we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ def2 ] ) as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and finally define @xmath63 in the following we deal with the different realizations of this compact expression .",
    "as we will see explicitly , the function @xmath64 occurring as integrand can be seen as quark - antiquark potential where we have summed over the spin of the tensor product of a final state with an initial state . because the static quark - antiquark potential is used in a similar way in ref .",
    "@xcite , we recover the result of ref .",
    "@xcite in the static limit .",
    "the leading order contribution to the self energy of the quark is given by @xmath65 where feynman gauge is used for the gluon .",
    "the soft part of it is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the procedure of taking the soft part by setting a cut is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a  b ) .",
    "the two potential parts are known as the scattering potential @xmath69 and the annihilation potential @xmath70 and correspond to the two zeros @xmath71 of the delta function . integrating the potential up to the factorization scale @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath72 the expansion of this expression in small values of @xmath73 results in @xmath74 the first term reproduces the result given in ref .",
    "@xcite to leading order in @xmath26 while the second term is the recoil correction to the static limit in this order of perturbation theory .",
    "this second term is related to the breit - fermi potential but does not coincide with it .",
    "to take a step beyond the leading order perturbation theory , we consider two - loop diagrams for the heavy quark self energy as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "in cutting the quark line in all possible ways we obtain a lot of diagrams from the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . however , we find that the final contribution of the two abelian diagrams in fig .  [ fig3](a ",
    "b ) to the soft part of the self energy is suppressed by @xmath75 . therefore it turns out that the only abelian diagrams which can give a non - suppressed contribution to the soft part of the quark self energy are the diagrams containing the vacuum polarization of the gluon as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d  f ) .",
    "the simple calculation of these diagrams within the @xmath8 scheme , accounting only for light fermion loops , gluon loop ( and ghost loop if feynman gauge is used ) results after renormalization in @xmath76 with the same coefficient @xmath77 as in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see below ) .",
