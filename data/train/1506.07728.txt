    "a central theme in cosmology is the fact that the universe is currently undergoing an accelerating expansion @xcite . in this context , during the last two decades cosmology has evolved from being mainly a theoretical area of physics to become a field supported by observational data .",
    "recent experiments call upon state of the art technology in astronomy and astrophysics to provide detailed information on the contents and history of the universe , which has led to the measuring of the parameters that describe our universe with increasing precision",
    ". the standard model of cosmology is remarkably successful in accounting for the observed features of the universe .",
    "however , there remain a number of open questions concerning the foundations of that standard model .",
    "in particular , we lack a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms underlying the acceleration of the late - time universe .",
    "what is the so - called `` dark energy '' that is driving the cosmic acceleration ?",
    "is it a vacuum energy or a dynamical field ? is the acceleration due to modifications of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) ?",
    "how is structure formation affected in these alternative scenarios ?",
    "what happens to the universe in the asymptotic future ?",
    "the resolution of these fundamental questions , looking beyond the standard theories of gravity and particle physics , is extremely important for theoretical cosmology and theoretical physics as a whole .",
    "the standard model of cosmology has favoured dark energy models as fundamental candidates responsible for the cosmic expansion .",
    "however , it is clear that these questions involve not only gravity , but also particle physics .",
    "string theory provides a synthesis of these two branches of physics and is widely believed to be moving towards a viable quantum gravity theory , given time .",
    "one of the key predictions of string theory is the existence of extra spatial dimensions . in the brane - world scenario , motivated by recent developments in string theory ,",
    "the observed 4-dimensional universe is embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime @xcite .",
    "the new degrees of freedom belong to the gravitational sector , and can be responsible for the late - time cosmic acceleration @xcite . on the other hand , generalisations of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , including quadratic lagrangians which involve second order curvature invariants have also been extensively explored @xcite . an alternative approach was formulated in @xcite .",
    "curvature - matter couplings have also been extensively analysed @xcite . while these modified theories of gravity offer an alternative explanation to the standard cosmological model for the expansion history of the universe @xcite , it offers a paradigm for nature fundamentally distinct from dark energy models of cosmic acceleration @xcite , even those that perfectly mimic the same expansion history .",
    "it is also fundamental to understand how one may differentiate these modified theories of gravity from dark energy models .    in this context , a promising way to explain the late - time cosmic acceleration is to assume that at large scales einstein s theory of gr breaks down , and a more general action describes the gravitational field .",
    "thus , one may generalise the einstein - hilbert action by including `` quadratic lagrangians '' , involving second order curvature invariants .",
    "some of the physical motivations for these modifications of gravity were related to the possibility of a more realistic representation of the gravitational fields near curvature singularities and to create some first order approximation for the quantum theory of gravitational fields . on the other hand , field theories in theoretical physics",
    "tends to have lagrangians quadratic in field strengths , gravity being somewhat different .",
    "one may tackle the problem using the metric formalism , which consists in varying the action with respect to the metric , although other alternative approaches have been considered in the literature , namely , the palatini formalism @xcite , where the metric and the connections are treated as separate variables ; and the metric - affine formalism , where the matter part of the action now depends and is varied with respect to the connection @xcite .",
    "recently , a novel approach to modified theories of gravity that consists of adding to the einstein - hilbert lagrangian an @xmath4 term constructed a la palatini @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the theory can pass the solar system observational constraints even if the scalar field is very light .",
    "this implies the existence of a long - range scalar field , which is able to modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics , but leaves the solar system unaffected .",
    "these explicit models are consistent with local tests and lead to the late - time cosmic acceleration , and also verify the absence of instabilities in perturbations .    in this work ,",
    "we intend to consider a generalised modified gravity theory , @xmath0 gravity , where @xmath1 is the ricci scalar , @xmath2 a scalar field , and @xmath3 a kinetic term .",
    "this theory contains a wide range of known dark energy and modified gravity models , for instance @xmath4 gravity models or galileons . here",
    "we apply it to the late - time cosmic acceleration .",
    "in particular , several cosmological solutions are studied within the framework of these theories , specifically solutions that can provide cosmic acceleration at late times , and even the exact @xmath5cdm evolution .",
    "reconstructions techniques are implemented in order to obtain the @xmath0 of the action given a particular hubble parameter .",
    "this provides a way to efficiently check the viability of any gravitational action by just considering a particular cosmological evolution and then analysing the gravitational action .",
    "an action of the form @xmath0 is in fact quite natural as it removes any assumptions on the underlying theory of gravity with the exception of being second order .",
    "we can think of the field @xmath2 as the effective field controlling the strength of the gravitational force .",
    "one should emphasise that normal matter is still coupled minimally to this theory .",
    "this paper is organised in the following manner : in section [ sec2 ] , we present the general formalism of @xmath0 gravity . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we analyse cosmological applications , in particular , to the late - time cosmic acceleration , by considering specific models and reconstructing the corresponding gravitational action .",
    "then , we discuss in the conclusions at section [ conclusions ] about the results obtained and possible future considerations of these theories .",

    "one may easily show that the these effective dark energy components satisfy the usual conservation equation , i.e. , @xmath26 this is expected since the left - hand sides of ( [ modfriedeq1b])([modfriedeq2b ] ) are equivalent to the general relativistic field equations containing the einstein tensor which satisfies the twice contracted bianchi identities .",
    "let us define the dark energy equation of state given by @xmath27 , which by using eqs .",
    "( [ modfriedeq1b])([modfriedeq2b ] ) takes the form @xmath28 in order to specify the matter content , let us choose the equation of state @xmath29 . in turn",

    "we are considering pure de sitter solutions , also power law solutions and finally we are reconstructing an exact @xmath5cdm model . note that this kind of cosmological solutions have already been considered in the literature within modified gravity theories , specially in @xmath4 gravity and gauss - bonnet gravity . in particular , power - law solutions were found in @xcite while exact @xmath5cdm model were reconstructed in @xcite . in order to simplify the calculations ,",
    "we restrict to a matter lagrangian with a pressure - less fluid , as natural when analysing late - time cosmology .      here",

    "firstly we assume a pure de sitter solution , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant .",
