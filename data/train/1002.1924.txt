    "a smaller @xmath111 in ceru@xmath0si@xmath0 might explain why this system is paramagnetic .",
    "in addition , cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 is probably close to a mixed valence regime .",
    "this is indicated by the smallness of its sommerfeld coefficient @xmath101 , which reaches only 80  mj / mol.k@xmath112 at the critical pressure @xmath88 , and of its small pressure dependence ( ref . ) .",
    "the value of @xmath101 at @xmath88 in cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 is rather similar to that of typical mixed - valence compounds , e.g. @xmath113 mj",
    "/ mol / k@xmath112 in cesn@xmath114 ( ref . ) .",
    "also , the drop of the magnetic anisotropy in cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 ( ref . ) might be related to a broadening of the crystal - field levels due to a strong enhancement of @xmath110 when entering into the valence intermediate regime .",
    "a unique property of cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 is that its ordering temperature is strongly pressure dependent since the rather high value of @xmath10  k at ambient pressure is driven to zero at a `` relatively small '' pressure @xmath115  kbar .",
    "the strong pressure - dependence of @xmath30 close to @xmath88 could be due to a strong increase of @xmath110 under pressure because of the proximity to a valence transition @xmath97 . knowing that @xmath4 reaches 36  t at @xmath88 in cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 ( ref . )",
    "one can further speculate if , for pressure bigger than @xmath88 and @xmath97 , a magnetic field could push the system to a valence critical point ( as discussed in ref . ) .",
    "in such case , a study of the variations of @xmath9 approaching and through the field - induced valence critical point would give important clues about the formation of quasiparticules in heavy - fermion and intermediate - valent systems .",
    "a study of the heavy - fermion antiferromagnet cerh@xmath0si@xmath0 has been performed in high magnetic fields of up to 50  t. from resistivity , torque , magnetostriction , and thermal expansion measurements we deduced its magnetic field - temperature phase diagram .",
    "it is composed of at least three distinct antiferromagnetic phases and possibly of a tetra - critical point .",
    "fits of our resistivity data showed i ) a large @xmath28-window where the quadratic coefficient @xmath9 is enhanced , in contrast to the sharpness of the metamagnetic transitions , and ii ) that similar values are obtained for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "this implies that both pressure- and magnetic field - induced criticalities might be controlled by common features , although they are expected to be governed by antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic fluctuations , respectively .",
    "for both pressure- and field - induced magnetic instabilities the effective mass is not found to diverge .",
    "finally , the drop of the resistivity observed at @xmath4 is compatible with the recent observation of a fermi surface reconstruction at @xmath4 , possibly related to a large decoupling between the majority and minority spin band .",
    "we thank m. nardone , a. zitouni , and j. bard for experimental support , a. demuer and i. sheikin for discussions and for showing us data prior to publication , and l. malone for carefully reading the manuscript .",
    "this work was supported by the french anr delice and by euromagnet ii via the eu contract rii3-ct-2004 - 506239 .",
    "a first - order transition is characterized by a step - like anomaly in the first - derivatives of the free energy , as the entropy , the length , and the magnetization .",
    "subsequently , it is accompanied by a symmetric and sharp extremum , at which the transition temperature or field can be defined , in the second - derivatives of the free energy , as the specific heat , the thermal expansion and magnetostriction coefficients , and the field - derivative of the magnetization ( or torque ) .",
    "a second - order transition is characterized by a step - like anomaly in the second - derivatives of the free energy - the transition temperature or field can be defined at the extremum of slope , generally at the half of the step ."
