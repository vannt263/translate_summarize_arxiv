    "the possibility to access cross section much below the coulomb barrier has revealed new aspects like the hindrance of fusion cross section ( see for instance @xcite ) whose origin is still debated @xcite . among possible interpretation , other competing processes like single- or multi - nucleon transfer might eventually be enhanced and/or modify the capture process @xcite .",
    "new experimental observations @xcite in the moderate and deep sub - barrier regime might lead to important new insight especially on the process of pair transfer .",
    "the description of such pair transfer is particularly complex since it requires to treat the quantum tunneling of a composite , eventually correlated , system . in particular , pairing correlations among last bound nucleons is anticipated to play a crucial role . following the pioneering work of refs @xcite , an important effort is currently being made to improve the description of pair transfer in superfluid systems @xcite .",
    "these approaches have usually in common that transition probabilities from the initial to the final nucleus are estimated using state of the art hartree - fock bogolyubov ( hfb ) and quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) nuclear models while the reaction dynamics part is treated in a completely separated steps using coupled channels technique .",
    "the present work is an attempt to treat nuclear structure and nuclear reaction aspects in a common microscopic framework that includes pairing .",
    "recently , active research has been devoted to include pairing correlations into the nuclear dynamics using the time - dependent hfb ( tdhfb ) approach @xcite .",
    "while current applications can be performed in an unrestricted space , due to the required effort , applications of tdhfb have been essentially made on process involving one nucleus , like giant resonances .",
    "the use of tdhfb to nuclear reactions remains tedious . a simplified version of tdhfb based on the bcs approximation is considered .",
    "this theory has been proposed already some times ago @xcite and recently applied with some success either to collective motion in nuclei @xcite , to reactions in 1d models @xcite .",
    "first step toward collisions have been reported in ref .",
    "the tdhf+bcs approach has the advantage to be simpler than the original tdhfb theory while keeping part of the physics of pairing .",
    "note that , time - dependent microscopic theories have several advantages compared to other techniques .",
    "many effects , like possible dynamical deformation or core polarization during the reaction are automatically accounted for .",
    "in addition , other competing phenomena like emission to the continuum and/or fusion are simultaneously treated . since",
    ", many aspects of the theory applied here have been extensively discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , only main aspects features are recalled below .",
    "time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) has become a standard tool to describe nuclear reactions like fusion or transfer reactions ( see @xcite and ref . therein ) . in the present work , the tdhf3d code of ref .",
    "@xcite is extended to include pairing correlations .",
    "below , specific aspects related to the introduction of pairing are discussed .",
    "the reaction is simulated on a 3-dimensional mesh . following the standard procedure @xcite ,",
    "the two nuclei are initiated separately and then positioned consistently with the desired impact parameter @xmath5 and center of mass energy @xmath6 .",
    "the initial wave function can be written as @xmath7 denotes the many - body wave - function of nucleus @xmath8 .",
    "usually , these wave - functions corresponds to slater determinants .",
    "it is assumed here to take the more general form of a quasi - particle vacuum written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 stands for the creation operator associated to the canonical single - particle states , denoted hereafter by @xmath11 while @xmath12 are the standard upper and lower components of the quasi - particle states .",
    "note that due to the spatial separation of the two nuclei , a common single - particle basis can be used .",
    "accordingly , we can omit the @xmath13 index and directly write the total wave - function as : @xmath14-space and spin space , denoted by @xmath15 as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are standard spinors creation operators . in ev8 ,",
    "time - reversal symmetry is assumed and single - particle states can be grouped by pairs of time - reversed states @xmath18 . associated quasi - particle creation operators @xmath19 are written using the following convention for the bogolyubov transformation : @xmath20 where , using time - reversal properties , we have @xmath21    the skyrme sly4d functional @xcite is used in the mean - field channel while for pairing , the following effective neutron - neutron interaction is used : @xmath22/2)}{\\rho_0 } \\right)\\delta_{{\\mathbf r},{\\mathbf r ' } } \\left[1-p_{\\sigma \\sigma ' } \\right ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the spin exchange operator and where @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "here @xmath26 stands for neutron or proton channel , only neutron - neutron and proton - proton interaction are considered .",
    "three different forces , standardly called volume ( @xmath27 ) , mixed ( @xmath28 ) and surface ( @xmath29 ) will be used below . in each case , the neutron pairing interaction strength @xmath30 was adjusted to properly reproduce the experimental gap for the calcium isotopic chain deduced from masses using the @xmath31 points formula @xcite .",
    "theoretical odd systems binding energies have been computed using blocking techniques .",

    "the tdhf+bcs results obtained by neglecting ( crosses ) or not ( open circles ) the anomalous density contribution are systematically compared with the mean - field case ( open triangles ) .",
    "note that for panel ( d ) , both nuclei are closed shell nuclei and pairing correlations vanishes . accordingly , only the mean - field result is shown . ]    in all cases , when one of the collision partner presents pairing , the two - particle transfer probabilities are significantly enhanced .",
    "conjointly , the one - particle transfer is also increased but to a less extend .",
    "this implies that the mean number of particles exchanged is also influenced by the pairing correlations due to the sum - rule ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : sumrule ] ) ) . comparing the tdhf results where the effect of @xmath36 is included ( direct+sequential process ) to the case where it is neglected ( sequential only )",
    ", several conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first , the one - particle probability is almost unchanged . therefore , the enhancement in @xmath0 observed in bcs theory compared to the pure mean - field case is a direct consequence of the specific fragmentation of occupation numbers due to pairing that reduces pauli blocking effect during the transfer process and is unaffected by the simultaneous component .",
    "a second important conclusion is that the main source of enhancement observed in @xmath1 is coming from the initial two - body correlations themselves that lead to direct process during the collision .",
    "this confirms the observation made in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .      to further quantify the influence of pairing correlations on the enhancement of two - particle transfer and possible dependence with center of mass energy , the ratio @xmath37 is displayed as a function of the mass of the heaviest nucleus participating to the collision and for two different fixed center of mass energies below the coulomb barrier . for comparison ,",
    "the neutron mean gap , @xmath38 obtained for this nucleus is also shown in the top panel .    .",
    "open triangles and open squares correspond to 4 mev and 6 mev below the coulomb barrier respectively . ]     as a function of beam energies .",
    "the different panel correspond to different reactions : ( a ) @xmath2ca+@xmath32ca , ( b ) @xmath2ca+@xmath33ca , ( c ) @xmath2ca+@xmath34ca and ( d ) @xmath2ca+@xmath35ca .",
    "the tdhf+bcs results obtained by neglecting ( crosses ) or not ( open circles ) the anomalous density contribution are systematically compared with the mean - field case ( open triangles ) . ]    similarly to the pairing gap , this ratio has a typical bell shape that drops down to one in magic nuclei .",
    "this confirms that the enhancement of pair transfer is directly proportional to the initial pairing correlations ( see for instance discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "experimentally , the no - pairing limit that would be a reference for a given reaction , can not be measured .",
    "it is therefore important to compare quantities that could be measure simultaneously .",
    "usually , the two - particle transfer @xmath1 is compared to @xmath40 , where the latter quantity is considered as the probability for a completely sequential transfer @xcite .",
    "such a comparison has the advantage that both quantities contain all possible effects that might influence the transfer of particles as well as possible pollution from coming from experimental set - ups . in figure",
    "[ fig : ca4xratios ] , this ratio is presented for different theories considered here .",
    "this figure gives interesting insight in the two - particle transfer .",
    "first , both mean - field and tdhf+bcs where only the fragmentation of single - particle state is accounted for while @xmath41 , lead to almost identical ratios .",
    "this aspect was not clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : ca4x ] where different fragmentations obtained with the filling approximation and from bcs with @xmath42 lead to differences for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the mean - field theory or equivalently the bcs where initial correlations are neglected could be considered as a way to mimic independent transfer of the two - particles .",
    "it turns out that simple combinatorial arguments can be used to understand analytically the sequential limit .",
    "let us denote by @xmath43 the average probability to transfer one particle from the @xmath44ca to @xmath2ca . here",
    "`` average '' means that we disregard the fact the the probability depends on the initial and final single - particle states .",
    "it turns out that the total probability to transfer 1 , 2 , ... , k nucleons during the reaction @xmath44ca+@xmath2ca for @xmath45 in the mf approximation is consistent with : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of valence nucleons ( with the constraint @xmath48 ) in the emitter with respect to the inert core of @xmath2ca , while @xmath49 is a purely combinatorial factor that depends on the number of nucleons in the valence shell and on the number of available single - particle states in the @xmath50 empty shell of the receiver nucleus ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "@xmath49 simply counts the number of possibilities to select @xmath52 particles among @xmath53 times the number of ways to put them in the @xmath50 shell , i.e. @xmath54 accordingly , one can anticipate that @xmath55 where the last approximation holds if @xmath56 .",
    "this simple approximation turns out to work very well in the mean - field case ( or equivalently in the pairing case when @xmath36 is neglected ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : p2p1bis ] , the quantity @xmath57 is compared to the left side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : factor ] ) for the different reactions considered here .",
    "we see that for a wide range of center of mass energy , mean - field results perfectly matches the relation ( [ eq : factor ] ) .",
    "the fact that such a simple description is adequate in mean - field theory is not trivial . indeed , in this theory , nucleons are quantal objects interacting first with two cores ( the emitter and the receiver nucleus ) that are not fully inert and second with each other through the self - consistent mean - field .",
    "last , the two transferred nuclei are fermions and are subject to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this induces automatically correlations during the transfer .",
    "if a particle is already transferred to a certain single - particle level , this automatically forbid the other particles to be transferred to the same level .",
    "the latter effect is automatically included in the present theory and partially described through the factor @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkn ] ) .     as a function of center of mass energy for the reaction @xmath32ca+@xmath2ca ( open circles ) , @xmath33ca+@xmath2ca ( open triangles ) , @xmath34ca+@xmath2ca ( cross ) and @xmath35ca+@xmath2ca ( open squares ) .",
    "the horizontal lines correspond in each case to the value of left side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : factor ] ) where @xmath51 while @xmath58 for @xmath44ca+@xmath2ca reactions . ]",
    "focussing now on the results accounting for initial correlations ( open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca4xratios ] ) , a strong , center of mass energy dependent , enhancement of the ratio is seen .",
    "the ratio increases significantly as the energy decreases from a value lower than 1 up to 20 in some cases .",
    "the present enhancement is at variance with the recent experimental observation in @xmath2ca+@xmath59zr where @xmath60 has been observed almost independently of the center of mass energy @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning however that the one- and two - particle transfer is anticipated to depend significantly on the structure properties , single - particle energies and spectroscopic factors , of the two collisions partners .",
    "in addition , here we are focussing on pairing correlation effect and paid a particular attention to not mix effects coming from static deformation in nuclei .",
    "last , mean - field alone can not grasp the physics of the quantum fluctuations in collective space .",
    "the inclusion of pairing partially cure this problem by increasing fluctuations of two - body observables .",
    "however , pairing alone does not contain all physical effects to treat this problem .",
    "this is clearly illustrated close to magicity where pairing vanishes . in that case ,",
    "tdhf dynamics is known to fail to reproduce transfer cross section . recently",
    ", a stochastic mean - field approach was shown to properly describe quantal collective fluctuations especially in magic nuclei @xcite and leads to realistic description of the nucleon exchange process .",
    "it would be interesting , in the near future to explore the possibility to combine stochastic methods with the present bcs approach .",
    "the tdhf+bcs theory with frozen correlations is used here to investigate the effect of pairing on one- and two - nucleon transfer below the coulomb barrier . a method based on projection onto particle number",
    "is developed to properly extract transfer probabilities from theories that break the u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "in addition , a particular attention is paid to compare with a no - pairing limit free from possible effect of deformation . with this technique ,",
    "the enhancement of two - particle transfer due to pairing correlations is studied qualitatively and quantitatively for reactions involving different calcium isotopes .",
    "it is shown , that when one of the collision partner has non - zero pairing , a strong enhancement of pair transfer is observed .",
    "this increase is directly proportional to the initial pairing correlations in the superfluid nucleus and turns out to strongly depend on the center of mass energy .",
    "in the present appendix , formulas useful for the numerical estimate of particle number projection are given for many - body quasi - particle states and density operators respectively given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fullwf ] ) and ( [ eq : dens ] ) .      starting from the density ( [ eq : dens ] )",

    "@xcite is properly recovered .",
    "formulas for the double - projection technique can be derived using a similar technique .      to perform projection of quasi - particle vacuum onto good particle number",
    ", we used the recently proposed pfaffian method @xcite . since the pfaffian technique has been largely discussed recently , here ,",
    "only specific formulas useful in the present article are given .",

    "numerically , the gauge integral are discretized using the fomenko method @xcite with 20 points .",
    "note that during the time evolution , due to accumulated numerical errors , small violation of orthonormalization between single - particle states can occur , this might lead to large errors in the extracted transfer probabilities . to avoid this problem ,",
