    "there exist just two quantum affine algebras of rank @xmath3 : @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "the algebra @xmath4 and its representation theory are both very well studied .",
    "the situation with @xmath0 is somewhat different , although the algebra itself and its representation are interesting from the standpoints of both mathematics and mathematical physics .",
    "the algebra @xmath0 first appeared in works on physics .",
    "the fundamental representation of the @xmath5-matrix of @xmath0 was obtained in @xcite as the @xmath5-matrix of the quantum version of the shabat - mikhailov model , also known as the izergin - korepin model .",
    "the same representation was later obtained in @xcite among fundamental representations of @xmath5-matrices of other nonexceptional affine lie algebras .",
    "the bethe ansatz technique was later extended onto @xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "finally , the ideas of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz for @xmath0 were developed in @xcite , and some finite dimensional representations were obtained there .",
    "the algebra @xmath0 was also investigated from an algebraic standpoint . in @xcite ,",
    "the cartan - weyl basis for @xmath0 was established , and the universal @xmath5-matrix was written in terms of infinite products of elements of the cartan - weyl basis .",
    "a classification of finite dimensional representations of algebra @xmath0 was obtained in @xcite by means of the drinfeld polynomials .",
    "later , an integral formula for the universal @xmath5-matrix for @xmath0 appeared in @xcite , where @xmath0 was treated as a topological hopf algebra with the drinfeld comultiplication .",
    "in the same work , the serre relations in @xmath0 were represented in terms of zeros and poles of products of the drinfeld currents .",
    "finally , integral representations for factors of the universal @xmath5-matrix for @xmath0 were derived in @xcite , where @xmath0 was endowed with the standard hopf structure .",
    "quantum affine algebras allow three different realizations with different hopf structures .",
    "the first one is the `` standard '' realization given by the chevalley generators and relations determined by the corresponding cartan matrix .",
    "the standard realization has a small number of generators , but is unfortunately very difficult to use in applications .",
    "the second realization , the drinfeld `` new realization '' , was first established in @xcite by means of generating functions ( the drinfeld `` currents '' ) and relations on them .",
    "the drinfeld realization allows using methods of complex analysis .",
    "moreover , it makes it possible to give the classification of the finite dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra . finally , the third one is the @xmath1 realization , based on the faddeev - reshetikhin - takhtajan - semenov - tian - shansky approach , where generators are combined into @xmath6-operators , satisfying the famous yang - baxter equation ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the simplicity of comultiplication in the @xmath1 realization allows to construct new representations as tensor products of already known ones .",
    "the @xmath1 realization is therefore widely used in physical models .",
    "it is universally acknowledged that the three realizations are isomorphic , although precise proofs hardly exist for any algebra other then of the @xmath7 type . for @xmath7 , an isomorphism between the standard and the drinfeld realizations",
    "was established in @xcite , whereas links between the drinfeld and the @xmath1 approaches were studied in @xcite .    in the case of quantum twisted affine algebras ,",
    "the @xmath1 realization requires additional relations .",
    "although it is believed that the three realizations are also isomorphic for the twisted algebras , there is no full understanding of what the exact isomorphism should look like .",
    "an isomorphism between the standard and the drinfeld realizations for @xmath0 was established in @xcite , and an isomorphism between the @xmath1 and the drinfeld realizations was partly derived in @xcite .",
    "a more complete bibliography can be found in @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we obtain a full description of the three realizations of algebra @xmath0 ( without grading element and with zero central charge ) , the isomorphisms between them , and the links between the three hopf structures .",
    "we also pay special attention to the following fact : each realization has a `` minimal '' set of generators ( or almost minimal in the twisted case ) and an extended set of generators .",
    "these two sets should be linked by an analogue of the pbw - theorem if there exists one . in the standard realization , these sets are the chevalley generators and the cartan - weyl basis . in the drinfeld realization , they are the drinfeld currents and the so - called `` composite currents '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in the @xmath1-realization , the gaussian coordinates immediately above or below the diagonal form the `` minimal '' set , and all the gaussian coordinates form the extended set .",
    "we note that these extended sets of generators are crucial for calculations of the universal weight function . here",
    ", we obtain a link between projections of the composite currents and the gaussian coordinates for @xmath0 as was done for @xmath8 in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we introduce the three realizations . in section @xmath3",
    ", we obtain the isomorphisms between them . in section @xmath9 , we represent elements of the extended set of gaussian coordinates in terms of composite currents .",
    "_ for simplicity of exposition , we consider the algebra @xmath0 without grading element and with zero central charge .",
    "all the statements also hold for an algebra with grading element and arbitrary central charge , but the formulas become more involved . _      let @xmath10 be the associative algebra generated by elements @xmath11 subject to certain commutation relations .",
    "the relations are given as formal power series identities for generating functions ( currents ) @xmath12 as follows : ( z - q^2w)(qz+w)e(z)e(w ) & = & ( q^2z - w)(z+qw)e(w)e(z ) , + ( q^2z - w)(z+qw)f(z)f(w ) & = & ( z - q^2w)(qz+w)f(w)f(z ) , + k^+(z)e(w)k^+(z)^-1 & = & ( w / z)e(w ) , + k^+(z)f(w)k^+(z)^-1 & = & ( w / z)^-1f(w ) , + k^-(z)e(w)k^-(z)^-1 & = & ( z / w)^-1e(w ) , + k^-(z)f(w)k^-(z)^-1 & = & ( z / w)f(w ) , + k^(z)k^(w ) & = & k^(w)k^(z ) , + k^-(z)k^+(w ) & = & k^+(w)k^-(z ) , + e(z)f(w)-f(w)e(z ) & = & 1q - q^-1 . where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is a formal laurent series , given by @xmath15    the generating functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 also satisfy the cubic serre relations ( see @xcite ) : _ z_1,z_2,z_3",
