    "<S> static and dynamic properties of vortices in a two - component bose - einstein condensate with rashba spin - orbit coupling are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the mass current around a vortex core in the plane - wave phase is found to be deformed by the spin - orbit coupling , and this makes the dynamics of the vortex pairs quite different from those in a scalar bose - einstein condensate . </S>",
    "<S> the velocity of a vortex - antivortex pair is much smaller than that without spin - orbit coupling , and there exist stationary states . </S>",
    "<S> two vortices with the same circulation move away from each other or unite to form a stationary state . </S>"
