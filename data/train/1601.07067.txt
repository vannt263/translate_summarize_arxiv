    "the image potential ( ip )  a potential experienced by a test charge outside a semi - infinite medium , a slab , or a system of a lower dimensionality  is a fundamental concept of classical electrostatics @xcite .",

    "regardless of the ultimate answer to the question of whether or not the xc potential ( which is not a physical quantity ) is equal in vacuum to the ip for a test charge ( which _ is _ a physical quantity ) , for the classical image potential of 2(1)deg . ] the determination of the former is fundamentally important in quantum physics .",
    "indeed , it defines the ks band - structure of the system of interest , which step , followed by a calculation of the system s response within the time - dependent dft @xcite , will produce excitations to image states ( which are quite physical properties ) . while for semi - infinite media the problem still remains highly controversial @xcite , for _ slabs",

    "we solve this problem _ exactly _ and _ analytically _ at the exx level of dft and find that , at @xmath4 , but still in vacuum , the potential is qualitatively and quantitatively different from its asymptotic form @xmath3 .",

    "<S> the exchange - correlation potential experienced by an electron in the free space adjacent to a solid surface or to a low - dimensional system defines the fundamental image states and is generally important in surface- and nano - science . here </S>",
    "<S> we determine the potential near the two- and one - dimensional electron gases ( eg ) , doing this analytically at the level of the exact exchange of the density - functional theory ( dft ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , at @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the distance from the eg and @xmath2 is the fermi radius , the potential obeys the already known asymptotic @xmath3 , while at @xmath4 , but _ still in vacuum _ , qualitative and quantitative deviations of the exchange potential from the asymptotic law occur . </S>",
    "<S> the playground of the excitations to the low - lying image states falls into the latter regime , causing significant departure from the rydberg series . in general , our analytical exchange potentials establish benchmarks for numerical approaches in the low - dimensional science , where dft is by far the most common tool . </S>"
