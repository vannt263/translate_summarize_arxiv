    "the absolute value of neutrino masses are very difficult to measure experimentally . on the other hand , mass differences between neutrino mass eigenstates , @xmath4 ,",
    "can be measured in neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "observations of atmospheric neutrinos suggest a squared mass difference of @xmath5 ev@xmath6 @xcite . while there are still several viable solutions to the solar neutrino problem the so - called large mixing angle solution gives by far the best fit with @xmath7 ev@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in the simplest case where neutrino masses are hierarchical these results suggest that @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "if the hierarchy is inverted @xcite one instead finds @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is also possible that neutrino masses are degenerate @xcite , @xmath14 , in which case oscillation experiments are not useful for determining the absolute mass scale .",
    "experiments which rely on kinematical effects of the neutrino mass offer the strongest probe of this overall mass scale .",
    "tritium decay measurements have been able to put an upper limit on the electron neutrino mass of 2.2 ev ( 95% conf . )",
    "@xcite . however , cosmology at present yields an even stronger limit which is also based on the kinematics of neutrino mass .",
    "neutrinos decouple at a temperature of 1 - 2 mev in the early universe , shortly before electron - positron annihilation .",
    "therefore their temperature is lower than the photon temperature by a factor @xmath15 .",
    "this again means that the total neutrino number density is related to the photon number density by @xmath16    massive neutrinos with masses @xmath17 ev are non - relativistic at present and therefore contribute to the cosmological matter density @xcite @xmath18 calculated for a present day photon temperature @xmath19k . here , @xmath20 .",
    "however , because they are so light these neutrinos free stream on a scale of roughly @xmath21 @xcite . below this scale neutrino perturbations are completely erased and therefore the matter power spectrum is suppressed , roughly by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this power spectrum suppression allows for a determination of the neutrino mass from measurements of the matter power spectrum on large scales .",
    "this matter spectrum is related to the galaxy correlation spectrum measured in large scale structure ( lss ) surveys via the bias parameter , @xmath23 .",
    "such analyses have been performed several times before @xcite , most recently using data from the 2df galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "this investigation finds an upper limit of 1.8 - 2.2 ev for the sum of neutrino masses .",
    "however , this result is based on a relatively limited cosmological parameter space .",
    "it should also be noted that , although massive neutrinos have little impact on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) power spectrum , it is still necessary to include cmb data in any analysis in order to determine other cosmological parameters .    in the present paper",
    "we perform an extensive analysis , carefully discussing the issue of parameter degeneracies .",
    "the next section is devoted to a fisher matrix analysis of the problem which establishes possible parameter degeneracies and yields a general idea of the precision with which the neutrino mass can be measured .",
    "section iii describes a full numerical likelihood analysis of data from cmb and lss which yields a robust limit on the neutrino mass .",
    "finally , section iv contains a discussion and conclusion .",
    "measuring neutrino masses from cosmological data is quite involved since for both cmb and lss the power spectra depend on a plethora of different parameters in addition to the neutrino mass .",
    "furthermore , since the cmb and matter power spectra depend on many different parameters one might worry that an analysis which is too restricted in parameter space could give spuriously strong limits on a given parameter . therefore , it is desirable to study possible parameter degeneracies in a simple way before embarking on a full numerical likelihood analysis .",
    "it is possible to estimate the precision with which the cosmological model parameters can be extracted from a given hypothetical data set .",
    "the starting point for any parameter extraction is the vector of data points , @xmath24 .",
    "this can be in the form of the raw data , or in compressed form , typically the power spectrum ( @xmath25 for cmb and @xmath26 for lss ) .",
    "each data point has contributions from both signal and noise , @xmath27 .",
    "if both signal and noise are gaussian distributed it is possible to build a likelihood function from the measured data which has the following form @xcite @xmath28 x \\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a vector describing the given point in model parameter space and @xmath30 is the data covariance matrix . in the following we shall always work with data in the form of a set of power spectrum coefficients , @xmath31 , which can be either @xmath25 or @xmath26 .    if the data points are uncorrelated so that the data covariance matrix is diagonal , the likelihood function can be reduced to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a @xmath34-statistics and @xmath35 is the number of power spectrum data points @xcite .",
    "the maximum likelihood is an unbiased estimator , which means that @xmath36 here @xmath37 indicates the true parameter vector of the underlying cosmological model and @xmath38 is the average estimate of parameters from maximizing the likelihood function .",
    "the likelihood function should thus peak at @xmath39 , and we can expand it to second order around this value .",
    "the first order derivatives are zero , and the expression is thus    @xmath40\\right ) ( \\theta_j-\\theta),\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 indicate elements in the parameter vector @xmath42 .",
    "the second term in the second derivative can be expected to be very small because @xmath43 is in essence just a random measurement error which should average out .",
    "the remaining term is usually referred to as the fisher information matrix @xmath44 the fisher matrix is closely related to the precision with which the parameters , @xmath45 , can be determined .",
    "if all free parameters are to be determined from the data alone without any priors then it follows from the cramer - rao inequality @xcite that @xmath46 for an optimal unbiased estimator , such as the maximum likelihood @xcite .    in order to estimate",
    "how degenerate parameter @xmath47 is with another parameter , @xmath48 , one can calculate how @xmath49 changes if parameter @xmath48 is kept fixed instead of free in the analysis .",
    "starting from the @xmath50 sub - matrix @xmath51 one then finds @xmath52    we therefore define the quantity @xmath53 as a measure of the degeneracy between parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    in order to perform an actual calculation we use the most present data from cmb and lss .    _ cmb data set  _ several data sets of high precision are now publicly available .",
    "in addition to the cobe @xcite data for small @xmath54 there are data from boomerang @xcite , maxima @xcite , dasi @xcite and several other experiments @xcite .",
    "wang , tegmark and zaldarriaga @xcite have compiled a combined data set from all these available data , including calibration errors . in the present work we use this compiled data set , which is",
    "both easy to use and includes all relevant present information .",
    "altogether there are 24 cmb data points in this compilation .    _ lss data set  _ at present , by far the largest survey available is the 2df @xcite of which about 147,000 galaxies have so far been analysed .",
    "tegmark , hamilton and xu @xcite have calculated a power spectrum , @xmath26 , from this data , which we use in the present work .",
    "the 2df data extends to very small scales where there are large effects of non - linearity .",
    "since we only calculate linear power spectra , we use ( in accordance with standard procedure ) only data on scales larger than @xmath55 , where effects of non - linearity should be minimal . making this cut",
    "reduces the number of power spectrum data points to 18 .    for calculating the theoretical cmb and matter power spectra we use the publicly available cmbfast package @xcite .",
    "as the set of cosmological parameters we choose @xmath56 , the matter density , @xmath57 , the curvature parameter , @xmath58 , the baryon density , @xmath1 , the hubble parameter , @xmath59 , the scalar spectral index of the primordial fluctuation spectrum , @xmath60 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath61 , the normalization of the cmb power spectrum , @xmath62 , the bias parameter , and @xmath63 , the neutrino density . in all cases",
    "we take the number of massive neutrinos to be 3 .",
    "the reason is that if neutrinos are to have an impact on cmb and matter spectra their masses must be much larger than the mass splitting inferred from atmospheric neutrino observations ( @xmath64 ev ) , and therefore neutrino masses will be degenerate with @xmath65 .",

    "however , @xmath72 is most likely so close to zero that only future high precision experiments may be able to measure it .",
    "the same is true for other additional parameters .",
    "deviations from the slow - roll prediction of a simple power - law initial spectrum @xcite or additional relativistic energy density @xcite could be present .",
    "however , such effects only appear in cosmological models which are more complicated than the `` standard '' @xmath73cdm model .",
    "the parameters we use fully describe the features of the simplest working model .    in the end",
    "one can check the consistency of the numerical parameter extraction by calculating the @xmath34 per degree of freedom . in section iii",
    "we find that the best fit is consistent with expectations and therefore it is unlikely that there are other parameters significantly affecting the power spectra",

    "1 shows the matrix @xmath74 , calculated for the wtz + 2df data set errors , around a reference cosmological model with parameters @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , i.e.  the @xmath73cdm concordance model .",
    "note that @xmath81 is an ill - defined quantity . for plotting purposes we simply put @xmath82 , but this has no physical significance .",
    "= 10truecm    from this general matrix one can study the @xmath83-related degeneracies more closely .",
    "clearly the two parameters most degenerate with @xmath83 are @xmath56 , the matter density , and @xmath62 , the bias .",
    "this is not surprising because a non - zero neutrino mass has little effect on the cmb acoustic peaks and a large effect on the matter power spectrum on scales below the free streaming scale .",
    "therefore , any parameter which behaves in a similar way will cause degeneracy .",
    "this is indeed the case for @xmath56 , if this parameter is changed while keeping @xmath84 fixed there is little effect on cmb . on the other hand , changing @xmath56 changes the normalization of the matter power spectrum at small scales relative to large scales .",
    "changing @xmath62 also mimics a non - zero neutrino mass .",
    "the reason is that present day lss data have large error bars around the free - streaming scale for light neutrinos in the ev range . on low scales the effect of massive neutrinos",
    "is simply to lower the fluctuation level roughly as @xcite @xmath85 i.e.  it is scale independent and therefore indistinguishable from changing the bias , @xmath62 .",
    "this degeneracy can be broken by precision measurements around the free - streaming scale where the break in the power spectrum occurs .",
    "a good example of how the mass limit on neutrinos can be tightened if bias is fixed comes from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the mass limit comes from comparing the overall normalization of the spectra at cobe scales @xcite with those on cluster scales @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that , at present , keeping bias as a free parameter yields a much more robust constraint . to a much lesser extent",
    "the neutrino mass is also degenerate with the hubble parameter .",
    "it should be noted that there is little degeneracy with @xmath59 , the spectral index . in refs .",
    "@xcite a significant degeneracy between @xmath63 and @xmath59 was found when only lss data is considered .",
    "however , this is broken when cmb data is included ( as is also noted in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the reason being that changing @xmath59 affects both cmb and matter power spectra , not just the matter spectrum .    clearly , it would be desirable to fix the parameters with which the neutrino mass is most degenerate , @xmath56 , @xmath62 , and @xmath1 . as for @xmath56 one can use the snia result @xmath86 which applies to a flat universe @xcite . however , this value is not much more restrictive than what is found from the cmb+lss data alone .",
    "fixing the bias is much more difficult since it is not a physically well understood parameter . in elgaroy",
    "@xcite bias was kept as a free parameter , and we follow this line .",
    "@xmath1 has been determined precisely by the hst hubble key project to be @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "if all the above parameters are included in the fisher matrix analysis the estimated @xmath88 precision on @xmath83 is 1.8 ev , equivalent to a 95% confidence limit of 3.6 ev .",
    "the fisher matrix analysis can only give a general idea of the constraints which can be found from a given data set .",
    "in reality the likelihood is non - gaussian and away from the best fit point the formalism breaks down . in order to get reliable estimates",
    "it is necessary to perform a full numerical likelihood analysis over the space of cosmological parameters .    in this full numerical likelihood analysis",
    "we use a slightly restricted parameter space with the following free parameters : @xmath56 , @xmath58 , @xmath1 , @xmath59 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath60 .",
    "we restrict the analysis to flat models , @xmath89 .",
    "this has very little effect on the analysis because there is little degeneracy between @xmath83 and @xmath84 . in order to study the effect of the different priors we calculate three different cases , the priors",
    "for which can be seen in table i. the bbn prior on @xmath66 comes from ref .",

    "2 shows @xmath34 for the three different cases as a function of the @xmath83 .",
    "the best fit @xmath34 values are 24.81 , 25.66 , and 25.71 for the three different priors respectively . in comparison",
    "the number of degrees of freedom are 34 , 35 , and 36 , meaning that the fits are compatible with expectations , roughly within the 68% confidence interval .",

    "we have studied cosmological constraints on the neutrino masses from present cmb and lss data . initially a fisher matrix analysis was performed which illustrates the main degeneracies of @xmath83 with other cosmological parameters used in the analysis . from this simplified analysis",
    "it was estimated that the precision on @xmath3 should be roughly 3.6 ev at 95% confidence from cmb+lss data alone .",

    "we obtained a limit of @xmath92 ev at 95% confidence , while using no priors on the cmb+lss data yielded @xmath0 ev , again at 95% confidence .",

    "must either determine @xmath62 precisely in an independent way or obtain better lss power spectrum statistics around the scale corresponding to the free - streaming scale for neutrinos , @xmath96 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite will measure the power spectrum shape with higher precision on the relevant scale , and this data , combined with cmb data from the map experiment @xcite , will either push the limit by a factor of at least a few or indeed detect a non - zero neutrino mass directly .",
