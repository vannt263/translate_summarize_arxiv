    "seen in the figure , the agreement is very good for the heavier isotones closer to stability @xmath231 , while it becomes dramatically worse for the isotones with @xmath232 which lie within the island of inversion . at @xmath233 , the good agreement between usda / usdb and experiment",
    "is dramatically recovered , indicating that intruder components play a minimal role in the ground state structure of @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests the existence of a low-@xmath234 boundary ( or `` shore '' ) of the island of inversion beginning at @xmath235",
    "in conclusion , we have used the technique of invariant mass spectroscopy to make the first determination of the @xmath0 binding energy at @xmath228 kev .",
    "additionally , we have observed a neutron - unbound excited state in neighboring @xmath14 , with @xmath5 kev excitation energy .",
    "interpretation of the @xmath14 state in terms of shell model predictions is difficult due to the large number of levels predicted near @xmath178 kev and uncertainty in the reaction mechanism used to populate @xmath170 .",
    "the level structure of @xmath14 is relevant to a variety of open questions in nuclear physics , including the transition from pure @xmath4 to mixed @xmath4-@xmath8 neutron configurations and its associated consequences ( such as the large oxygen - fluorine dripline shift of six or more neutrons @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , it has been suggested @xcite that proton @xmath20-@xmath4 cross - shell excitations could play a role in the structure of low - lying @xmath14 excited states , possibly in tandem with @xmath4-@xmath236 shell breaking on the neutron side . as such",
    ", it would be interesting to revisit unbound excited states in @xmath14 experimentally , using a direct reaction mechanism that can selectively populate specific states .",
    "possible reactions include one- or two - proton knockout ( from @xmath237 or @xmath238 ) and @xmath239 in inverse kinematics .",
    "the measured @xmath0 binding energy indicates a low-@xmath234 boundary of the island of inversion at @xmath229",
    ". it would be interesting to further explore this mass region to see if this trend continues .",
    "extension of the present technique to lighter @xmath229 isotones ( @xmath240 ) would be very difficult , if not impossible , since they are all unbound by three or more neutrons @xcite .",
    "however , a similar technique could potentially be used in the @xmath6 isotonic chain by performing a direct mass measurement of bound @xmath241 . for this purpose",
    ", the precision obtainable with time - of - flight techniques at current in - flight radioactive beam facilities would likely be sufficient .",
    "such a measurement would be particularly interesting since the sdpf - m monte carlo shell model predicts @xmath241 to have a very large intruder occupation of @xmath242 ( @xmath243 two - particle , two - hole excitation and @xmath244 four - particle , four - hole ) @xcite .",
    "measuring its mass would provide the first experimental data on @xmath241 for comparison with theory and help to better explain the evolution of shell structure in the low-@xmath234 ( @xmath245 ) region around @xmath6 .",
