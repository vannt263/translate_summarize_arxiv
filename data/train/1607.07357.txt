    "the phenomenon of entanglement in quantum mechanics is in its essence the presence of action at a distance @xcite .",
    "the operational verification of entanglement thus consist of performing a task that is impossible without nonlocal causation such as for example quantum teleportation @xcite or producing bell - nonlocal correlations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the entanglement in a system of indistinguishable fermions where measurements on the system are performed by spatially separated parties , i.e. , experimenters .",
    "we assume that the number of fermions is conserved , i.e. , that there is a global particle number superlselection rule .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the spatial positions of the fermions are not well defined , i.e. , that they are delocalized .",
    "if there is no restriction on the local operations that a party can perform , the local degrees of freedom behave effectively as the degrees of freedom of a localized distinguishable particle .",
    "therefore , the entanglement properties can be qualitatively different , compared to the case of distinguishable particles , only if the allowed local operations are restricted .",
    "global particle number conservation can impose such a restriction , but only if at least some of the particles are delocalized , so that the local particle numbers are not fixed .",
    "for this reason we consider delocalization of the fermions together with the global particle number conservation .",
    "another possible restriction on the local operations is particle number parity conservation , which has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the entanglement between distinguishable particles without superselection rules has been extensively studied and characterized in a variety of ways for small numbers of particles .",
    "see e.g. refs .",
    "several tools have been developed to describe the entanglement in this case , such as the subsystem entropy @xcite and polynomial invariants under local operations @xcite .",
    "for pure states of such a system the description by these tools has a clear interpretation in terms of the ability to demonstrate nonlocal causation .",
    "if the subsystem entropy or the value of a polynomial invariant is nonzero , there exist some local operations that demonstrate nonlocal causation @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of indistinguishable particles has been less explored and the tools to describe it have been less developed . in this case , using the tools created for the case of distinguishable particles can lead to a description that does not carry the same physical meaning .",
    "for example , in a system where the set of allowed operations on the local hilbert space is restricted , a nonzero entropy of a subsystem or a nonzero value of an invariant under local operations does not necessarily imply that nonlocal causation can be demonstrated .",
    "this work describes the group of stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) @xcite for a system of delocalized indistinguishable spin-@xmath1 fermions with a global particle number superselection rule , and gives a method for constructing polynomial invariants under its action .",
    "concrete examples of such invariants are given for systems of two and three spin-@xmath1 fermions with access to a number of spatial modes .",
    "furthermore we show that if particle number conservation is the only constraint of the system , a nonzero value of an slocc invariant implies that there exist one or more bipartitions of the system for which bell - nonlocal correlations can be observed .",
    "this result extends to fermions with arbitrary spin .",
    "we also give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of slocc invariants as a relation between the number of fermions , their spin , and the number of spatial modes .",
    "for the case of two spin-@xmath1 fermions we compare the constructed slocc invariant , and the entanglement measure that is obtained from it , to the subsystem entropy and the fermionic concurrence @xcite , two other tools that have been used to characterize entanglement and correlations in fermionic systems .",
    "it is shown that neither the subsystem entropy nor the fermionic concurrence have a clear relation to bell - nonlocality .",
    "briefly we also consider a few cases with additional constraints , such as fixing the spatial location of a subset of the fermions or imposing strong repulsive or attractive interaction .",
    "for the case of strongly attractive interaction the relation between slocc invariants and bell - nonlocality that exists in the unconstrained case is no longer valid .",
    "finally , as an example we consider a hybrid ising - hubbard hamiltonian where the groundstate entanglement is well described by a measure constructed from a slocc invariant .",
    "the peak of this groundstate entanglement occurs at a transition between two qualitatively different physical regimes , one dominated by on - site interaction and one dominated by nearest neighbour ising - interaction .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the methods for characterizing entanglement and bell - nonlocality in a system with superselection rules are described .",
    "the focus is on the particle conservation superselection rule , and it is described how to construct the group of slocc .",
    "section [ sec3 ] gives the polynomial slocc invariants for two and three delocalized spin-@xmath1 fermions and discusses their physical meaning .",
    "in addition to this two conditions for the existence of slocc invariants for arbitrary numbers of fermions and arbitrary spin are given .",
    "section [ sec4 ] contains a brief discussion of slocc invariants and measures for cases with additional constraints and a few examples are given . in section [ sec5 ] the ising - hubbard hamiltonian with a groundstate that exhibits entanglement between three fermions at a transition between different physical regimes is described .",
    "the paper ends with the conclusions .",
    "the setting considered in this paper is a system containing a number of indistinguishable fermions . by fermions we mean particles that satisfy the pauli exclusion principle , i.e.",
    ", any two particles with the same internal state can not exist in the same spatial location .",
    "this constraint is equivalent to the requirement that the state vector acquires a minus sign when two particles are interchanged .",
    "in particular we focus on the case where each fermion has two internal degrees of freedom .",
    "we therefore use the example where the internal degree of freedom is spin and we denote the internal states by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but the results of the paper are independent of the physical nature of the two internal degrees of freedom . beyond this",
    "we assume that the global particle number is conserved .",
    "we also assume that the fermions have access to a finite number of spatial modes and that at least some of the fermions do not have well defined locations , i.e. , that they are delocalized . to each spatial mode",
    "we associate a party , i.e. , an experimenter , capable of performing measurements on any fermion or fermions that occupy its spatial mode .",
    "for some purposes we also consider parties with access to more than one spatial mode .",
    "when the locations of the fermions are not well defined it is not operationally meaningful to consider entanglement between degrees of freedom of the individual fermions . therefore we instead consider entanglement between the degrees of freedom accessible to the different parties @xcite , i.e. , entanglement between the modes of the system @xcite .",
    "the different parts of the system that can be entangled are therefore defined by the disjoint subsets of operations that the different parties can perform @xcite . in our case",
    "what restricts the allowed operations of a party to one of these subsets is the spatial separation of the parties , but more general cases have been considered in ref .",
    "entanglement between modes in a system of fermions has been considered previously in refs .",
    "@xcite for the case with a particle number parity superselection rule .",
    "correlations between fermions have been studied also in the terms of conserved quantities in systems of non - interacting fermions @xcite in particular the slater rank @xcite and its generalizations @xcite .",
    "the scenario where these quantities are physically relevant is operationally different from the scenario considered here . in particular , it does not involve spatially separated parties performing local operations , but instead considers a system under the restricted set of global operations that do not cause interaction between the fermions .",
    "the concept of entanglement presupposes a division of the system into parts corresponding to different parties . if we consider the case of three parties a , b , and c we can denote a tri - partitioning of the system by a|b|c . for a partitioning of this type",
    "it is assumed that a given party , e.g. party a , can act only on a subset of the degrees of freedom of the system that are locally accessible to a. these degrees of freedom are described by the local hilbert space @xmath4 . for a different partitioning of the system , e.g. a bi - partitioning a|bc , it is assumed that the degrees of freedom of both mode b and c are accessible to a party who can perform operations on the hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "the full hilbert space of the shared system is described by the tensor product @xmath6 of the individual local hilbert spaces . in the case of distinguishable particles and without restrictions on the local operations , a state , represented by a density matrix @xmath7 ,",
    "is entangled with respect to a partitioning if it can not be expressed as a _",
    "separable _ state .",
    "for example , a three - partite state is separable if it can be expressed as    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is a density matrix on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that the notion of separability depends on the partitioning of the system .",
    "a state that is non - separable for the partition a|b|c may still be separable for the partition a|bc .",
    "however , a state which is separable for the most fine grained partitioning , in this case a|b|c , is separable for any more coarse grained partitioning , such as the bi - partitioning a|bc .    in a system with a conserved quantity such as a charge , a particle number , or a parity , the set of physically allowed operations",
    "is restricted to those that do not change the given quantity .",
    "such a restriction is called a _ super - selection rule _ and imposes a restriction on the local operations that the parties can perform .",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for an introduction to superselection rules .",
    "for example , when the total value of the conserved quantity is the sum of local values , as is the case with the global particle number , the allowed local operations must conserve these local values . in this case",
    "it is possible to decompose the hilbert space @xmath13 of a system with @xmath14 spatial modes as a direct sum @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the hilbert space of the states with local conserved quantities @xmath17 of the @xmath14 spatial modes .",
    "the physically allowed local operations can not transform between the different sectors defined by the different @xmath16 .",
    "in particular , a local operation @xmath18 on the part of the system with local conserved quantity @xmath19 can not change the value of @xmath19 .",
    "any such allowed local operation can therefore be given a block - diagonal matrix form where each block is a transformation on a subspace of the local hilbert space corresponding to a given possible value of @xmath19 , i.e. ,    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a block containing an operation that preserves the value @xmath22 of the local conserved quantity , and @xmath23 is the maximum possible value of @xmath19 .",
    "this restriction to block diagonal form of the local operations implies that for two vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 that belong to different sectors , i.e. , that have different values of the local conserved quantities , it holds that @xmath26 for any local operation @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , if a state is a coherent superposition @xmath28 of two vectors @xmath24 and @xmath25 it can not be distinguished from the incoherent mixture @xmath29 by any local operations .",
    "a super - selection rule of this type therefore limits the ability of the parties to distinguish different states .",
    "in particular it limits the ability to distinguish non - separable from separable states .",
    "more precisely , for a non - separable state @xmath7 there may exist a separable state @xmath30 such that all physically allowed observables by parties a , b , and c have the same expectation values .",
    "therefore , we say that @xmath7 is indistinguishable from the separable state @xmath30 with respect to the given partitioning a|b|c if for any local measurements @xmath31 and @xmath32 it holds that    @xmath33    see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of separability in fermionic systems with a particle number parity super - selection rule .",
    "a state that is indistinguishable from a separable state for a fine grained partitioning , e.g. a|b|c , may still have entanglement that is detectable given a more coarse partitioning , e.g. a|bc .",
    "this is in contrast to the case without super - selection rules where the entanglement of the system can always be fully detected and characterized using the most fine grained partitioning .",
    "thus , in general , the task of operationally characterizing the entanglement in a system with a super - selection rule requires that correlations across all partitionings are considered .",
    "if there is no super - selection rule , parties that share a pure entangled state can always find local measurements with outcome correlations that are incompatible with a locally causal description of reality @xcite .",
    "correlations of this kind are called bell - nonlocal @xcite and we will refer to states for which such correlations can be observed as bell - nonlocal states . if there is a super - selection rule on the other hand a pure non - separable state may be indistinguishable from a separable state , and in this case all correlations are bell - local .",
    "this is in contrast to the case without super - selection rules where states of this kind do not exist .",
    "an example of a system with four spatial modes and two particles where bell nonlocal correlations can not be observed for a quadru - partition , but are present for a bipartition is the electronic two - particle hanbury brown - twiss interferometer @xcite . there , two electrons are emitted from independent sources and the path of each electron is split into two paths , i.e. , two spatial modes .",
    "if the paths are a and b for one electron and c and d for the other , bell - nonlocality can be observed across ac|bd and ad|bc by means of combining paths in each part of the partition , e.g. , a and c , and b and d , respectively , by means of a beam splitter .",
    "but nonlocal correlations can not be observed for ab|cd or a|b|c|d .",
    "states of fermions can be described in terms of creation and annihilation operators acting on the unpopulated vacuum state .",
    "the main focus in this paper is on a systems with three spin-@xmath1 fermions in three spatial modes under the control of three parties a , b , and c. we therefore give the explicit construction of the global and local hilbert spaces for this scenario .",
    "we denote the creation and annihilation operators of a fermion with spin up in the spatial mode of party a by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . in the same way",
    "let @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the same operators for a fermion with spin down in the spatial mode of a and let the operators @xmath38 and @xmath39 have the same meaning for parties b and c , respectively .",
    "the application of operators @xmath40 to the unpopulated spatial modes creates a state where a fermion with spin up is with party a and a fermion with spin down is with party c. however , applying the operators in the reverse order @xmath41 creates a state with the same population of the modes .",
    "these two states are related by an exchange of the two fermions .",
    "the antisymmetry under particle exchange implies that the two states are related by a phase - factor @xmath42 .",
    "this is encoded in the anti - commutation relations for the creation and annihilation operators    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , @xmath46 which encodes the pauli exclusion principle that prevents any states with more than one fermion with a given internal state in the same spatial mode .",
    "the fermionic exchange antisymmetry leads to a sign ambiguity in the definition of the hilbert space vectors .",
    "this ambiguity can be resolved by using an operator ordering ( see e.g. ref .",
    "we therefore use the convention that operators are ordered as @xmath47 , meaning an operator in the list is always applied before any other operator to the left of it when the basis vectors are created . note that we have chosen an ordering where operators that act on the same spatial mode are consecutive .",
    "such a choice naturally captures the spatial separation of a , b , and c and allows for a straightforward matrix representation of local operations .",
    "more precisely , we define the basis vectors of the local hilbert space of a as @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 denotes an unoccupied spatial mode and @xmath51 denotes the presence of two particles in a spatial mode .",
    "completely analogously we define the local hilbert spaces of b and c by replacing @xmath52 with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the basis vectors of the two party hilbert space of ab are defined as    @xmath55    where @xmath45 .",
    "the basis vectors for the hilbert space of bc are defined as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and the basis vectors for the hilbert space of ac are @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "finally , the basis vectors for the full hilbert space are defined as    @xmath60    where @xmath61 .    if a state @xmath24 in the full hilbert space is described by a polynomial in the creation operators that can be factorized into one polynomial that contains only creation operators on a single spatial mode , e.g. @xmath62 , and another polynomial that contains only creation operators on the other modes we express the state as a product state @xmath63 . in particular , all the basis vectors of the hilbert space , constructed above , can be expressed as @xmath64 for some @xmath65 .",
    "note that all product vectors of this form , with particle number from zero to six , span a 64 dimensional space where the basis vectors with three fermions in eq .",
    "[ kloo ] span a 20 dimensional subspace .",
    "next , we note that the operators that conserve local particle number of a spatial mode , e.g. c , are polynomials in the creation and annihilation operators where every monomial has an even number of operators , e.g @xmath66 and @xmath67 . any such polynomial commutes with @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 , and",
    "therefore it commutes with any operator on the other spatial modes .",
    "because of this , and given the operator ordering where operators acting on the same spatial mode are consecutive , we can represent the local operations that conserve particle number in a tensor product matrix form .",
    "for example , the operator @xmath71 can be represented as    @xmath72    where each individual matrix acts on the local 4 dimensional hilbert space and is given in the basis @xmath73 .",
    "the tensor product of the three matrices act on the 64 dimensional space spanned by the product vectors .",
    "we can thus see that a representation by an operator ordering where operators acting on the same spatial mode are consecutive effectively gives the hilbert space a tensor product structure .",
    "this facilitates the study of entanglement between the local degrees of freedom of the different parties , represented by @xmath73 .",
    "finally , we consider how to construct single - party reduced density matrices .",
    "a matrix @xmath74 can be called a reduced density matrix for party c if for any physically allowed local operation @xmath75 on @xmath76 it satisfies @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the density matrix of the full state .",
    "the reduced density matrix @xmath74 is defined as @xmath79 for @xmath80 .",
    "since the particle conserving local operations by c commute with @xmath81 for any @xmath45 it follows that @xmath82 for any @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the reduced density matrices of a and b can be defined analogously .",
    "the most general type of local operations that can be performed is the stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) @xcite .",
    "the operational meaning of slocc is that each party can entangle their modes with a local ancillary system , and subsequently perform a projective measurement on the ancillary system .",
    "this is then followed by postselection based on classical communication of the measurement outcomes .",
    "we limit our interest to the slocc operations that can be reversed in a probabilistic sense , i.e. , the operations @xmath18 which satisfy that @xmath24 can be obtained from @xmath86 by performing another slocc operation .",
    "it is with respect to the action of these reversible operations that invariants can be defined .    as described in sect .",
    "[ secoo ] , a global conservation of particle number implies that any local operation made on the system must conserve the local particle number .",
    "this implies a restriction of the operations to the block diagonal form given in eq .",
    "[ block ] .",
    "the reversible slocc on @xmath14 spatial modes satisfying the particle conservation super - selection rule is mathematically described by a block diagonal subgroup @xmath87 of @xmath88 , where sl is the special linear group . for the case of spin-@xmath1 fermions the local action of @xmath87",
    "is a subgroup of sl(4 ) .",
    "locally on each spatial mode the action of @xmath87 is described by block diagonal matrices @xmath18 of the form    @xmath89    where @xmath90 for the basis @xmath91 of the local hilbert space .",
    "the particle conservation super - selection rule is manifested in a block diagonal structure with three blocks .",
    "the @xmath92 block corresponds to the action on a single fermion in the mode , one of the @xmath93 blocks corresponds to the action on two fermions in the mode and the other @xmath93 block corresponds to the action in the absence of a fermion .",
    "note that the particle conservation also implies that every single - party reduced density matrix has the same block - diagonal form as the local operations .",
    "the group @xmath87 is a lie - group @xcite of determinant one matrices .",
    "any element in such a group can be expressed as the matrix exponential of a traceless matrix and the structure of the a group can be described in terms of a set of generators .",
    "the generators of the lie group are defined as a set of traceless matrices such that any element of the group can be expressed as a matrix exponential of some linear combination of the generators .    for a given spatial mode , the block diagonal structure in eq.[bl ]",
    "implies that the local action of the group @xmath87 is generated by the five hermitian traceless matrices    @xmath94    for example , this means that in the case of three parties any element of @xmath87 can be expressed as @xmath95 for some @xmath96 .",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite for a description of the generators of general su and sl groups .",
    "we can define the subgroup @xmath97 of @xmath87 as the group with local action generated by @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this group acts only on the local subspace spanned by @xmath2 and @xmath3 for each spatial mode .",
    "analogously , we can define the subgroup @xmath100 as the group with local action generated by @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the group @xmath100 contains the only operations with a non - trivial action on @xmath103 and @xmath104 which are allowed by the super - selection rule .",
    "for example , @xmath105 corresponds to a particle exchange of the fermions in the spatial mode of party a , conditioned on the presence of two fermions in this mode , and a @xmath106 global phase shift .",
    "it is clear from the form of the generators that @xmath97 and @xmath100 commute .",
    "therefore , we can express @xmath87 as a product of @xmath97 and @xmath100 , i.e. , @xmath107 .    for pure states of three fermions in three spatial modes",
    "the structure of @xmath87 leads to a simple relation between bell - nonlocality and the ability to distinguish the state from a separable state . such a state is bell - nonlocal if and only if it is distinguishable from a separable state .",
    "[ lemm1 ] a pure non - separable state of three delocalized fermions is bell - local with respect to a given partitioning if and only if it is indistinguishable from a separable state with respect to the same partitioning .",
    "the if part of the statement is trivial .",

    "consider the projection of this state onto the subspace where one fermion is localized with a and the two others with bc .",
    "this projection is @xmath109 .",
    "all states in the subspace spanned by @xmath110 and @xmath111 contain two fermions .",
    "therefore , within this subspace the operations by the party with access to the modes b and c are not restricted by the super - selection rule . because of this there exist measurements that exhibit nonlocal outcome correlations provided that the state is entangled as shown in ref .",
    "any outcomes where party a finds @xmath103 or @xmath104 has only local correlations regardless of the state of bc since nonlocal correlations require at least two incompatible measurements performed by a @xcite .",
    "such measurements can not be performed on the subspace spanned by @xmath103 or @xmath104 due to the particle number conservation superselection rule .",
    "the state is thus bell - local if and only if @xmath112 or @xmath113 .",
    "such a state is , up to local unitary operations , of the form @xmath114 and since the three terms belong to different super selction sectors this state is indistinguishable from a separable state @xmath115 .    for a partitioning a|b|c",
    "we consider the projection of the state onto a subspace where one fermion is with each party .",
    "if this projection is an entangled pure state there are measurements with nonlocal outcome statistics @xcite .",
    "if on the other hand the projection is a product state the outcome statistics is trivially bell - local .",
    "if instead party a finds its local state to be @xmath103 the state of parties b and c is projected onto the subspace spanned by @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 . no pair of local operations on b and c can transform between a vector @xmath120 and a vector @xmath121 for any @xmath45 because of the particle number conservation super - selection rule .",
    "this implies that all states within this subspace are indistinguishable from separable states .",
    "furthermore , for a vector of the kind @xmath120 or @xmath121 , incompatible measurements can only be performed on one of the two spatial modes .",
    "therefore any correlation between measurement outcomes are local .",
    "the same argument can be made if we exchange the roles of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , and for any permutation of the parties a , b , and c.      to characterize the entanglement of a system one can describe it in terms of quantities and parameters specific to a particular physical realization . however , our main interest is realization independent properties , i.e. , intrinsic properties of the system .",
    "an often used tool that depends only on intrinsic properties and describes entanglement between two parts of a system is the subsystem entropy @xcite .",
    "however , since the entropy is a single real valued function it can not in general capture all the different ways in which the parts of the system can be entangled . the subsystem entropy has been used in the study of fermionic systems in for example refs .",
    "a tool that can characterize all the different types of entanglement is the polynomial entanglement invariants @xcite .",
    "polynomial invariants can be constructed both for the local unitary operations and for slocc . here",
    "we focus on the invariants under slocc .",
    "a polynomial invariant of @xmath87 is defined as a polynomial in the coefficients of the state vector which is invariant under the action of @xmath87 .",
    "two states are said to have the same type of entanglement with respect to @xmath87 if they can be converted into each other by @xmath87 with a nonzero probability . if this is the case any ratio between two @xmath87 invariants take the same value for the two states . in this sense the invariants under @xmath87",
    "serve as coordinates on the space of @xmath87 inter - convertibility classes , i.e. , different types of entanglement with respect to @xmath87 .",
    "however , note that there exist a subset of the inter - covertibility classes that can not be distinguished by the @xmath87 invariants and even a subset where all @xmath87 invariants take the value zero .",
    "these classes can only be distinguished by invariants under local unitary operations .",
    "a subset of the invariants with the property that all invariants can be constructed algebraically from the subset is called a set of generators @xcite . any such set of generators",
    "thus gives the same description of the entanglement types as the full set of invariants .",
    "suitably chosen the generators correspond to physically relevant properties of the system that depend on the entanglement .",
    "another use for the slocc invariants is that any such invariant can be used to construct a function that is non - increasing under slocc , a so called _ entanglement monotone _ @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that if @xmath122 is a slocc invariant of degree @xmath123 , the function @xmath124 is an entanglement monotone . to understand the precise meaning of such a non - increasing function under slocc we must understand two properties of slocc operations and how they are mathematically represented",
    "first , a slocc operation , when represented as a determinant one matrix , does not generally preserve the norm of the state vector .",
    "this implies that if the state vector is normalized after the slocc operation has been performed , the value of @xmath122 for the output state is in general not the same as that of the input state .",
    "secondly , a slocc operation can in general not be performed with unit probability of success . the outcome state is a statistical mixture of the desired outcome state and some other state(s ) , and the desired slocc operation is realized only after a postselection to remove the undesired outcome states .    if the average of @xmath122 is taken over all outcome states , including the undesired ones , and these states are properly normalized , this average is typically not the same as the value for @xmath122 on the input state .",
    "however , the average value of the function @xmath124 does not increase @xcite .",
    "a function of this kind that does not increase under slocc , an entanglement monotone , quantifies a property of the system that can not be created by slocc . in a system without superselection rules",
    "this directly implies that it quantifies a property of the entanglement since all non - entangled states can be interconverted by slocc . in this case",
    "the monotone serves as a measure of the particular type of entanglement that is distinguished by the invariant it was constructed from .    closely related to entanglement measures",
    "is the notion of maximally entangled states .",
    "a maximally entangled state is defined as a pure state for which all the single - party reduced density matrices are maximally mixed @xcite .",

    "no systematic search for this type of invariants was undertaken for higher degrees due to the increasing complexity of the search with increasing polynomial degree .",

    "the hamiltonian of the system is chosen as a hybrid of the quantum ising hamiltonian @xcite and the hubbard hamiltonian @xcite .",

    "this choice of spin antisymmetry of the hopping terms is made to ensure that the ground level of the hamiltonian is non - degenerate and a unique groundstate can be identified .",
    "furthermore , we consider the case with a ferromagnetic ising interaction and an attractive on - site fermion interaction .    if the on - site interaction dominates over the ising interaction and the external field , and if the kinetic energy terms are much smaller than the potential energy terms , the groundstate is , to a good approximation , a superposition of different configurations where two fermions occupy the same site .",
    "we call this the paired regime .    if the ising interaction dominates over the on - site interaction , and the kinetic energy terms are small , the groundstate of the hamiltonian is close to a state where one fermion occupies each site .",

    "the groundstate in the paired regime for @xmath314 and for @xmath315 is not significantly different if @xmath316 .",

    "@xmath319 the groundstate is close to a product state where all the spins are aligned with the external field .",

    "if the values of @xmath306 and @xmath307 are appropriately chosen , an increase of the external magnetic field @xmath308 can bring the groundstate of the system from the paired regime to the ising regime .    to see this effect in the particular example hamiltonian considered here the potential energy terms",

    "all invariants of the group @xmath97 can be constructed through cayley s omega process .",
    "the cayley omega process is designed to find the invariants of the special linear group and since @xmath97 for three parties is isomorphic to @xmath167 we can use it to find the @xmath97 invariants . for a detailed and general description of cayleys omega process",
    "see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an application to invariants of unitary operations on a system of four distinguishable two level particles .    to use the omega process",
    "we must first represent the state of the system as a set of multilinear binary forms .",
    "we arrange the amplitudes @xmath170 of the state vector for which @xmath61 as a trilinear form @xmath374 , and the remaining amplitudes are arranged in six linear forms      the invariants are obtained recursively from the collection @xmath376 through iterating a type of operation called transvection defined by the following two steps . in the first step multiply two forms , e.g , @xmath377 and @xmath378 .",
    "then , apply a partial differential operator @xmath379 , where @xmath380 to @xmath381 .",
    "the operator @xmath382 is defined by      and @xmath384 and @xmath385 are defined analogously .",
    "this is followed by the substitution of @xmath386 for @xmath387 and @xmath388 .",
    "if several operators @xmath389 are applied , all of the involved variables are substituted .",
    "for example the application of @xmath390 is followed by the substitution @xmath386 for @xmath387 and @xmath388 and @xmath391 for @xmath392 and @xmath393 .",
    "if the result of a transvection is a new form , further transvections can be performed involving this form .",
    "if the result of a sequence of transvections is a scalar , this scalar is invariant under @xmath97 .    as a shortform notation",
    "we denote a transvection of two forms @xmath62 and @xmath308 on one index , e.g. @xmath394 , by @xmath395 , a transvection on two indices , e.g. @xmath396 , by @xmath397 , and so on .",
    "note that @xmath395 is a quadrilinear form with indices @xmath398 and @xmath397 is a bilinear form with indices @xmath399 .    from the @xmath97-invariants that can be constructed by cayley s omega process we select the subset which is also invariant under @xmath100 .",
    "this is the subset where each monomial term in the polynomial has an equal number of indices of the four possible ones @xmath400 , @xmath401 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "for example , the monomial @xmath402 is invariant under @xmath100 while @xmath403 is not .",
    "the requirement of invariance under @xmath100 restricts the degrees of the invariant polynomials to be multiples of four .",
    "all the possible transvections of the collection @xmath376 which are also invariant under @xmath100 were constructed for degrees 4 , 8 and 12 .",
    "a set of seven invariants from which all other invariants of these degrees can be constructed through multiplication and addition was selected .",
    "none of the invariants in this set can be constructed from the other elements of the set .",
    "this was seen by testing for linear dependence between all polynomials of degree 4 , 8 or 12 , respectively , that can be constructed by multiplication of the seven chosen invariants .                in the case of the partial localization described in sect .",
    "[ partloc ] all states of the system can be represented by the subset @xmath410 of the forms . the unique degree four polynomial slocc invariant in eq . [ kry ] can be constructed from these forms as          or alternatively as @xmath413 where @xmath414 is the three - tangle @xcite , i.e. , the hyperdeterminant of @xmath415 .",
    "analogously , for the cases where a fermion is localized with b or c , invariants can be constructed from the subsets @xmath416 and @xmath417 , respectively .",
    "when one fermion is localized with party a and the interaction of the two delocalized fermions is constrained to be strongly attractive the possible states of the system are described by the subset @xmath418 , and all slocc invariants are generated by the polynomial"
