    "anticipating the discovery of cholesteric liquid crystals by about two decades @xcite , reusch proposed in 1869 that a periodically nonhomogeneous multilayered material reflects normally incident circularly polarized light of one handedness , but not of the opposite handedness , provided that all layers are made of the same homogeneous , uniaxial dielectric material such that the optic axis in each layer is rotated about the thickness direction with respect to the optic axis in the adjacent layer by a fixed angle  @xcite .",
    "such a periodically nonhomogeneous dielectric material is nowadays called a _",
    "reusch pile_.    extensive theoretical and experimental work by joly and colleagues  @xcite showed that circular - polarization - selective reflection of normally incident light by a reusch pile may occur in several spectral regimes .",
    "this selective reflection of circularly polarized light of one handedness , but very little of the other , in a given spectral regime is commonly called circular bragg phenomenon  @xcite .    according to a classification scheme developed by hodgkinson",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite , if the number of layers in each period @xmath0 , the reusch pile can be called an equichiral material ; if @xmath1 , but not very large , it can be called an ambichiral material ; and if @xmath2 , it is a finely chiral material .",
    "equichiral materials do not exhibit the circular bragg phenomenon .",
    "ambichiral materials may exhibit the circular bragg phenomenon in several spectral regimes , depending on the variations of their constitutive parameters with frequency .",
    "therefore , a cholesteric liquid crystal @xcite can be considered as a finely chiral reusch pile made of uniaxial dielectric layers .",
    "reusch piles can also be made of biaxial dielectric material such as columnar thin films ( ctfs ) @xcite .",
    "a chiral sculptured thin film ( stf ) @xcite can be considered a finely chiral reusch pile comprising biaxial ctfs .",
    "chiral stfs were first fabricated by young and kowal  @xcite in 1959 and were rediscovered in the 1990s  @xcite .",
    "they have been extensively studied since then for optical applications exploiting the circular bragg phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "the effect of the number of layers @xmath3 on the circular bragg phenomenon has been studied  @xcite . both @xmath3 and the total number of periods",
    "have to be substantially large for the circular bragg phenomenon to fully develop  @xcite . what is the effect of @xmath3 on the surface - wave propagation guided by the interface of a homogeneous isotropic material and an ambichiral dielectric material ?",
    "the results reported in this letter are due to the investigations conducted to answer that question .",
    "the planar interface of an isotropic homogeneous metal and an ambichiral dielectric material can guide surface - plasmon - polariton waves .",

    "tamm waves . for surface waves of both types , we examined the evolution of the solution(s ) of the dispersion equation with @xmath3 .",

    "the associated electromagnetic fields depend on @xmath27 as @xmath29 , have no dependence on @xmath30 , and their dependences on @xmath19 in both half spaces indicate decay as @xmath31 .",
