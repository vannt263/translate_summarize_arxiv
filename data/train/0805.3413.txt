    "the _ square kilometer array _ ( ska ) is the next generation radio telescope facility for the 21st century .",
    "although it is still in the design stage and unlikely to be fully operational before 2020 , various pathfinder experiments will enter scientific service around 2010 ; one of these pathfinders will probably form the nucleus of the eventual ska and over the next decade grow in sensitivity from @xmath4 to 100 per cent ska .",
    "the scientific goals of the ska have been described at length elsewhere ( see e.g. carilli & rawlings  2004 ) , but it is now clear that a new generation of more sophisticated science simulations is needed to optimise the design of the new telescopes and their observing programmes for the efficient realisation of these goals . with this in mind , we present here a new semi - empirical simulation of the extragalactic radio continuum sky .",
    "the simulation is part of a suite of simulations developed under the european ska design study ( skads ) initiative and referred to collectively as _ skads simulated skies ( @xmath5)_. it is one of two simulations aimed at simulating the extragalactic continuum and line - emitting radio sky , which together offer distinct yet complementary approaches to modelling the radio sky .",
    "the first approach , used by the simulations described in this paper , may be best described as ` semi - empirical ' , in the sense that the simulated sources are generated by sampling the observed ( or extrapolated ) radio continuum luminosity functions .",
    "the second approach , pursued by obreschkow et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , is dubbed ` semi - analytical ' as it ascribes gas properties , star formation and black hole accretion rates to galaxy haloes identified in an n - body simulation .",
    "given their different emphases , the simulations are also commonly referred to as the ` continuum ' ( semi - empirical ) and ` hi ' ( semi - analytical ) simulations and , where appropriate , synergies between them will be highlighted .",
    "limitations in state - of - the - art n - body simulations mean that the semi - empirical simulations cover @xmath6  times more sky area than the semi - analytical ones .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to describe the essential methodology and basic ingredients of the semi - empirical simulation ( section 2 ) ; to demonstrate that its output satisfies some basic tests , such as reproducing the radio source counts , local luminosity function and angular clustering ( section 3 ) ; to highlight some known deficiencies of the simulations ( section 4 ) .",
    "simulation data products ( source catalogues and images ) can be accessed through a database web - interface ( http://s-cubed.physics.ox.ac.uk ) where full details of data format can be found .",
    "there have been several previous attempts to model the radio source counts at the faint flux levels appropriate for the ska and to produce simulated source catalogues , e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , windhorst  ( 2003 ) , jackson  ( 2004 ) , jarvis & rawlings  ( 2004 ) .",
    "our new simulation builds on these efforts and , like them , is empirically based in the sense that it draws sources at random from the observed ( or suitably extrapolated ) radio continuum luminosity functions for the extragalactic populations of interest . in a major advance over these works , however , we have attempted to model the spatial clustering of the sources instead of simply placing them on the sky with a uniform random distribution .",
    "this is an important feature because large scale structure measurements have emerged as a key ska goal , stemming from the possibility to constrain the properties of dark energy through the detection of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) ( e.g. abdalla & rawlings  2005 ) .",
    "the spatial clustering has been incorporated on large scales ( @xmath7 ) by biasing the galaxy populations relative to an underlying dark matter density field which is evolved under linear theory . on smaller scales ,",
    "we have also used the underlying dark matter density field to identify and populate clusters of galaxies .",
    "another major impetus for the development of the new simulations has been the desire to generate an extensive suite of output catalogues which can be stored as a database and queried via a public web interface .",
    "the aim is to use such a tool to generate ` idealised skies ' which can then be fed to telescope simulators for the production and analysis of artifical datasets .",
    "such a process is essential for optimising the design of the telescopes and their observing programmes .",
    "the semi - empirical simulation has been designed with the key ska science goals in galaxy evolution and large - scale structure in mind .",
    "the basic parameters are as follows :    @xmath8 _ sky area : _",
    "@xmath1 deg@xmath2 , approximately matching the largest plausible instantaneous field of view of a future ska aperture array .",
    "the latter will be used to perform hi redshift surveys out to @xmath9 over a significant fraction of the sky , in order to measure the galaxy power spectrum and the evolution of dark energy via baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) ( see e.g. abdalla & rawlings  2005 ) .",
    "@xmath8 _ maximum redshift : _ @xmath10 . probing the `` dark ages '' in hi and radio continuum is another key ska goal ( see e.g. carilli 2008 ) , and the redshift limit of the simulation has accordingly been set to include the reionization epoch .",

    "njy is of the order of the expected sensitivity for a 100h observation with the nominal ska sensitivity ( @xmath11  @xmath2 @xmath12 , 350  mhz bandwidth ) .",
    "the flux limits are applied such that if any structural sub - component of a galaxy ( i.e. core , lobes or hotspots in the case of a radio - loud agn ) has a flux density exceeding this limit at one or more of these frequencies , all sub - components of the galaxy are included in the output catalogue , regardless of whether they are all above the flux limit . in this paper , we neglect any intrinsic or induced polarization properties of the radio emission , but we expect the first major revision of the catalogue to include such information",
    ".    @xmath8 _ source populations : _ in addition to the classical double - lobed radio - loud agn of the fri and frii classes , the simulation will also incorporate radio emission from ` radio - quiet ' agn and star - forming galaxies .",
    "the latter population comprises relatively quiescent or ` normal ' late - type galaxies , as well as more luminous and compact starburst galaxies .",
    "together these two populations are expected to dominate the radio source counts below a few 100  at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the starting point for the simulation is a present - day ( @xmath13 ) dark matter density field , @xmath14 , defined on a cuboid grid of 5@xmath15  comoving cells with the overall array having dimensions @xmath16  cells ( the long axis defines the direction of increasing redshift ) . an imaginary observer is situated at the centre of one face of the grid and looks out into the simulation volume over a solid angle @xmath17 .",

    "we modify this as follows :    @xmath25    where g(z ) is the linear growth factor for fluctuations in the underlying dark matter density field , b(z ) is the redshift - dependent bias of the population of interest , and @xmath26 is a normalisation factor which ensures agreement with the luminosity function when averaged over the largest scales . for a gaussian density field , it is easily shown that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cell variance of the density field .",
    "simulated sources are generated by poisson - sampling the luminosity function at @xmath29 with mean @xmath30 .",
    "the formalism of eqn .",
    "( 1 ) is a somewhat adhoc , non - linear bias prescription which has the effect of amplifying the source density in over - dense regions and depressing it in under - dense regions .",
    "when the exponent is small it reduces to a linear bias prescription , i.e. @xmath31 . the use of a log - normal density field has the added benefit of accounting for a small amount of non - linear evolution in @xmath14 and also prevents the unphysical situation @xmath32 ( see coles & jones 1991 ) .",
    "the choice of the 5@xmath15  cell size reflects a compromise between ensuring that it is : ( i ) large enough to keep @xmath14 in the linear or quasi - linear regime ; ( ii ) large enough to keep the total number of cells in the simulation volume within computer memory constraints ; ( iii ) small enough to have sufficient mass resolution to identify a cluster of galaxies of mass @xmath33  ( see section 2.8 ) .",

    "2000 ) is used to compute a linear isotropic power spectrum complete with bao and an appropriate transfer function .",
    "the resulting @xmath13 power spectrum is sampled to generate fourier modes of the density field within the simulation volume , which is then fast fourier - transformed to yield the @xmath13 dark matter density field , @xmath14 , defined on the grid of @xmath41  cells .",
    "the latter is the starting point for the main simulation ( section 2.2 ) and the cluster finding algorithm ( section 2.8 ) .",
    "here we describe the luminosity functions used in the simulation . for all populations",
    ", it has been unavoidably necessary to extrapolate these in luminosity and redshift beyond the regimes in which they were observationally determined .",
    "we therefore expect that for many applications users will need to post - process the source catalogues to implement more realistic forms of high - redshift evolution , mostly by applying some form of negative space - density and/or luminosity evolution . alongside the description of each luminosity function",
    ", we indicate what we consider to be the most reasonable form of high - redshift post - processing for each luminosity function , based on the observational data available at the present time .",
    "however , in order not to restrict future applications of the simulations as constraints at high redshift improve in the years ahead , the online database tool will give the user the choice between applying either this default post - processing option or a user - defined form with space - density evolution and/or luminosity evolution decreasing in power - law or negative exponential form ( or no post - processing at all ) .",
    "in all cases , the radio emission has been modelled without including polarization properties and without making any explicit allowance for the effects of the increasing energy density of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) at high redshift .",

    "x - ray luminosity relation , jarvis & rawlings  ( 2004 ) showed that radio - quiet agn can make a significant contribution to the well - characterised upturn in the 1.4  ghz source counts below 1  mjy , a feature which had previously been ascribed largely ( although not without controversy ) to star - forming galaxies ( see e.g. seymour et al .",
    "recent multi - wavelength identification work on several deep fields appears to substantiate this claim ( e.g. simpson et al .",

    "[ fig : pdz ] , compared with 37 3crr sources ; the small number of real objects beyond @xmath47 in fig .  [ fig : pdz ] ( to which 3crr is insensitive ) reflects the fact that the simulation covers 5.5 times the area of the 7crs ( 0.12 vs 0.022  ) .",
    "an example of a case-(ii ) difference is that the simulation hard - wires a @xmath221  cut - off in size , which declines with redshift , whereas a few larger ( giant ) sources larger than this redshift - dependent limit are seen in the real data out to @xmath149 .",
    "there is clearly much scope for ameliorating such problems by applying more sophisticated radio sources evolution models , although as emphasised by brw this needs to be done in a self - consistent way that simultaneously models the space - and - time - dependent spectral indices of the extended radio - emitting components and also models variations in the radio source environments .",
    "the main focus of these simulations is the radio continuum emission . as discussed in section 2.6 , however",
    ", we can use the loose correlation between hi mass and star formation rate to assign hi masses to the star - forming galaxies .",
    "although this relation was measured for the ` normal galaxy ' population , we also apply it to the starburst galaxies , even though it is unlikely to hold for the most extreme objects .",
    "we did not attempt to assign hi masses to the agn populations because there are no simple observationally - based prescriptions for doing so .",
    "moreover , the agn are most likely to reside in early - type galaxies , whose contribution to the local hi mass function is significantly less than that of the late - types ( zwaan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the @xmath222 hi mass function of the star - forming galaxies in the simulation is shown in fig  [ fig : himassfn ] , where it is compared with that from the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass ) ( zwaan et al .",
    "the excess contribution in the simulations over the hipass fit above @xmath223  is due to the contribution of the starburst galaxies which , as discussed above , are likely to have lower hi masses than those implied by the hi mass  star formation rate relation of the normal galaxies .",
    "the divergence between the simulations and the hipass fit at lower masses is chiefly due to the absence in our simulation of a dwarf / irregular galaxy population ; zwaan et al . showed that this population ( morphological type `` sm - irr '' ) accounts for an increasing proportion of the hi mass function as the mass is reduced below @xmath224 , and essentially for all of it in the range @xmath205 .",
    "however , such a population is probably not accounted for in our normal galaxy radio luminosity function , even though the lower integration limit for the latter of log @xmath225  [ w / hz / sr ] equates to a very modest star formation rate of around @xmath226 .",
    "compared with normal galaxies , dwarf galaxies are gas - rich objects , with higher ratios of hi mass to star formation rate ( see e.g. roberts & haynes  1992 ) , possibly because conditions in the dwarf galaxies do not meet disc instability criteria necessary for the onset of star formation .    a much fuller treatment of hi is provided by the skads semi - analytic simulations of obreschkow et al .",

    "here we reiterate what we regard as the most important weaknesses in our modelling approach that users should be aware of .",
    "some of these issues can be circumvented with appropriate post - processing , whereas others are hard - wired into the simulation and therefore of a more fundamental nature .",
    "+ @xmath8 _ the use of extrapolated luminosity functions . _",
    "the extrapolation of luminosity functions beyond the regimes of luminosity and redshift in which they were determined is unavoidable when attempting to simulate a next generation facility with a quantum leap in sensitivity over existing telescopes .",
    "the most important aspect of this concerns the faint end of the normal galaxy radio luminosity function , which is controversial even in the regime already observed . as discussed in section 2.4 , we assume that the luminosity function flattens below log l@xmath227  [ w / hz / sr ] , as determined by mauch & sadler  ( 2007 ) , whilst others ( e.g. hopkins et al .",
    "2000 ) have supplemented this with an additional population derived from an optical luminosity function .",
    "we also assumed that the luminosity function of the star - forming galaxies does not evolve further in redshift from @xmath75 out to the redshift limit , @xmath3 .",
    "this is clearly unrealistic , but it gives the user full freedom to implement any particular form of decline in the star formation rate as a post processing task , as multi - wavelength constraints on high - redshift star formation accrue in the coming years .",
    "for example , stronger forms of high - redshift decline in the space density can be implemented by random sampling the existing catalogue . for all luminosity functions ,",
    "we have indicated the default post - processing option for negative high - redshift evolution , and on the web database users will have the choice between implementing this or some other form .",
    "+ @xmath8 _ the lack of star - forming / agn hybrid galaxies and double counting . _",
    "the use of separate luminosity functions for the agn and star - forming galaxies is a fundamental design limitation of this simulation , and it prevents us from explicitly modelling hybrid galaxies where both processes contribute to the radio emission .",
    "however , such galaxies are implicitly present in the simulation for the reason that at the faint end of the agn radio luminosity function , star formation may make a non - negligible contribution to the radio emission .",
    "similarly , some of the powerful starbursts may contain sizeable agn contributions .",
    "these effects will lead to a certain amount of double counting , perhaps over - producing the faint source counts .",
    "+ @xmath8 _ the lack of small - scale non - linear clustering_. due to the use of @xmath41  cells and a linear - theory power spectrum , this simulation does not model small - scale non - linear clustering in a satisfactory manner .",
    "this is not considered a serious problem because the simulation was primarily designed to model the clustering on large - scales , which is adequately described by our linear theory prescriptions .",
    "the ` semi - analytical ' simulations of obreschkow et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , based on n - body simulations , provide a much better description of small - scale non - linear clustering .",
    "+ @xmath8 _ the treatment of galaxy clusters .",
    "_ clusters were identified in the mass density field using a numerical press - schechter filtering method . the coarse sampling of the density field and the sharpness of the real - space mass filter result in a quantisation of the cluster masses .",
    "users with particular interest in the clusters would thus need to post - process the masses to obtain a continuous distribution to match the sheth - tormen  ( 1999 ) mass function ( which provides a better fit to n - body simulations at the high mass end than the standard press - schecther formalism ) .",
    "it should also be noted that galaxies were assigned to the clusters in a very simplistic fashion , with no account of infall regions , for example .",
    "a more fundamental design limitation of the simulation is that the underlying galaxy luminosity functions are assumed to be the same in the cluster and field environments .",
    "the semi - empirical simulation described in this paper has been designed to be used in an interactive fashion for optimising the design of the ska and its observing programmes in order to achieve its scientific goals .",
    "for this reason , we have made the galaxy catalogues available via a web - based database ( http://s-cubed.physics.ox.ac.uk ) , which users can interactively query to generate ` idealised radio skies ' according to their requirements .",
    "such skies can then be fed to ( software ) telescope simulators to facilitate the development of data processing and calibration pipeline routines .",
    "the extent to which the scientific content of the simulations can then be recovered at the end of such a simulation chain will enable observing programmes to be optimised for various models of the telescope hardware .",
    "in parallel with such work , we also anticipate that the simulations will be a valuable tool in the interpretation of existing radio surveys with abundant follow - up data .",
