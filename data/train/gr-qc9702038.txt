    "after more than two decades of investigations , black hole thermodynamics is still one of the most puzzling subjects in theoretical physics .",
    "one approach to studying the thermodynamical aspects of a black hole involves considering the evolution of quantum matter fields propagating on a classical ( curved ) background spacetime .",
    "this gives rise to the phenomenon of black hole radiation that was discovered by hawking in 1974 @xcite .",
    "combining hawking s discovery of black hole radiance with the classical laws of black hole mechanics @xcite , leads to the laws of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the entropy of a black hole obtained from this approach may be interpreted as resulting from averaging over the matter field degrees of freedom lying either inside the black hole @xcite or , equivalently , outside the black hole @xcite , as was first anticipated by bekenstein @xcite even before hawking s discovery .",
    "the above approach was further developed in the following years @xcite .",
    "a second route to black hole thermodynamics involves using the path - integral approach to quantum gravity to study _ vacuum _ spacetimes ( i.e. , spacetimes without matter fields ) . in this method ,",
    "the thermodynamical partition function is computed from the propagator in the saddle point approximation @xcite and it leads to the same laws of black hole thermodynamics as obtained by the first method .",
    "the second approach was further developed in the following years @xcite .",
    "the fact that the laws of black hole thermodynamics can be derived without considering matter fields , suggests that there may be a purely geometrical ( spacetime ) origin of these laws .",
    "however , a complete geometrical understanding of black hole thermodynamics is not yet present .    in general , a basic understanding of the thermodynamical properties of a system requires a specification of the system s ( dynamical ) degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) .",
    "obtaining such a specification is a nontrivial matter in quantum gravity . in the path - integral approach",
    "one avoids the discussion of the dynamical d.o.f .. there , the dominant contribution to the partition function comes from a saddle point , which is a classical euclidean solution @xcite . calculating the contribution of such a solution to the partition function",
    "does not require an identification of what the dynamical d.o.f.s of this solution are .",
    "though providing us with an elegant way of getting the laws of black hole thermodynamics , the path - integral approach does not give us the basic ( dynamical ) d.o.f .",
    "from which we can have a better geometrical understanding of the origin of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "it was only recently that the dynamical geometric d.o.f . for a spherically symmetric vacuum schwarzschild black hole",
    "were found @xcite under certain boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , by considering general foliations of the complete kruskal extension of the schrawzschild spacetime , kucha @xcite finds a reduced system of _ one _ pair of canonical variables that can be viewed as global geometric d.o.f .. one of these is the schwarzschild mass , while the other one , its conjugate momentum , is the difference between the parametrization times at right and left spatial infinities . using the approach of kucha ,",
    "recently louko and whiting @xcite ( henceforth referred to as lw ) studied black hole thermodynamics in the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , they considered a foliation in which the spatial hypersurfaces are restricted to lie in the right exterior region of the kruskal diagram and found the corresponding reduced phase space system .",
    "this enabled them to find the unconstrained hamiltonian ( which evolves these spatial hypersurfaces ) and canonically quantize this reduced theory .",
    "they then obtain the schrdinger time - evolution operator in terms of the reduced hamiltonian . the partition function @xmath0 is defined as the trace of the euclideanised time - evolution operator @xmath1 , namely , @xmath2 , where the hat denotes a quantum operator .",
    "this partition function has the same expression as the one obtained from the path - integral approach and expectedly yields the laws of black hole thermodynamics .    in a standard thermodynamical system",
    "it is not essential to consider _",
    "euclidean_-time action in order to study the thermodynamics .",
    "if @xmath3 is the lorentzian time - independent hamiltonian of the system , then the partition function is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inverse temperature of the system in equilibrium .",
    "however , in many cases ( especially , in time- independent systems ) the euclidean time - evolution operator turns out to be the same as @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , there are cases where , as we will see in section [ subsec : lwham ] , the euclidean time - evolution operator is not the same as @xmath7 .",
    "this is the case for example in the lw approach , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the reduced hamiltonian of the quantized lw system .",
    "there is a geometrical reason for this inequality and in this work we discuss it in detail . in this paper , we ask if there exists a hamiltonian @xmath3 ( which is associated with certain foliations of the schwarzschild spacetime ) appropriate for finding the partition function of a schwarzschild black hole enclosed inside a finite - sized box using ( [ partition - trace ] )",
    ". such a procedure will not resort to euclideanization . in our quest to obtain the hamiltonian that is appropriate for defining the partition function for ( [ partition - trace ] )",
    ", we also clarify the physical significance of the lw hamiltonian . by doing",
    "so we hope to achieve a better understanding of the geometrical origin of the thermodynamical aspects of a black hole spacetime .    in a previous work @xcite , brown and york ( henceforth referred to as by ) found a general expression for the quasilocal energy on a timelike two - surface that bounds a spatial three - surface located in a spacetime region that can be decomposed as a product of a spatial three - surface and a real line interval representing time . from this expression",
    "they obtained the quasilocal energy inside a spherical box centered at the origin of a four - dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "they argued that this expression also gives the correct quasilocal energy on a box in the schwarzschild spacetime . in this paper",
    "we show that , although their expression for the quasilocal energy on a box in the schwarzschild spacetime is correct , the analysis they use to obtain it requires to be extended when applied to the case of schwarzschild spacetime . in this case",
    ", one needs to impose extra boundary conditions at the timelike boundary inside the hole ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . as mentioned above , in principle",
    ", one can use the hamiltonian @xmath10 so obtained to evaluate the partition function , @xmath11 .",
    "this partition function corresponds to the canonical ensemble and describes the thermodynamics of a system whose volume and temperature are fixed but whose energy content is permitted to vary .",
    "such a hamiltonian , @xmath10 would then lead to a description of black hole thermodynamics without any sort of euclideanisation .",
    "the only obstacle to this route to the partition function is that the trace can be evaluated only if one knows the density of the energy eigenstates .",
    "unfortunately , without knowing what the thermodynamical entropy of the system is , it is not clear how to find this density in terms of the reduced phase - space variables of kucha @xcite .",
    "so how can one derive the thermodynamical laws of the schwarzschild black hole using a lorentzian hamiltonian without knowing the density of states ?",
    "based on an observation that identifies the thermodynamical roles of the by and the lw hamiltonians we succeed in studying black hole thermodynamics within the hamiltonian formulation but without euclideanization . in section [ sec : thermoconsi ] we describe the thermodynamical roles of the by and the lw hamiltonians .",
    "identifying these roles allows us to immediately calculate the partition function and recover the thermodynamical properties of the schwarzschild black hole . in section [ sec : geoconsi ] we study the geometrical significance of these hamiltonians .",
    "in particular , we extend the work of brown and york @xcite to find the nature of the spatial slices that are evolved by the by hamiltonian in the full kruskal extension of the schwarzschild spacetime . in section [ geothermo ]",
    "we use the observations made in sections [ sec : thermoconsi ] and [ sec : geoconsi ] to ascribe geometrical basis to the thermodynamical parameters of the system , thus gaining insight into the geometrical nature of black hole thermodynamics .",
    "we conclude the paper in section [ sec : conclu ] by summarising our results and discussing the connection between the foliation geometry and equilibrium black hole thermodynamics . in appendix",
    "a we extend our results to the case of two - dimensional dilatonic black holes . in appendix",
    "b we discuss an alternative foliation ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , in which the spatial slices are again evolved by the by hamiltonian @xmath12 . this illustrates the non - uniqueness of the foliation associated with the by hamiltonian .",
    "we shall work throughout in `` geometrized - units '' in which @xmath13 .",
    "it was shown by brown and york @xcite that in 4d spherically symmetric einstein gravity , the quasilocal energy of a system that is enclosed inside a spherical box of finite surface area and which can be embedded in an asymptotically flat space is @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the adm mass of the spacetime and @xmath16 is the fixed curvature radius of the box with its origin at the center of symmetry .",
    "we will call @xmath12 the brown - york hamiltonian .",
    "the brown and york derivation of the quasilocal energy can be summarised as follows .",
    "the system they consider is a spatial three - surface @xmath17 bounded by a two - surface @xmath18 in a spacetime region that can be decomposed as a product of a spatial three - surface and a real line interval representing time ( see fig .",
    "the time evolution of the two - surface boundary @xmath18 is the timelike three - surface boundary @xmath19 .",
    "they then obtain a surface stress - tensor on the boundary by taking the functional derivative of the action with respect to the three - metric on @xmath19 .",
    "the energy surface density is the projection of the surface stress tensor normal to a family of spacelike two - surfaces like @xmath18 that foliate @xmath19 .",
    "the integral of the energy surface density over such a two - surface @xmath18 is the quasilocal energy associated with a spacelike three - surface @xmath17 whose _ orthogonal _  intersection with @xmath19 is the two - boundary @xmath18 .    as argued by by , eq .",
    "( [ quasih ] ) also describes the total energy content of a box enclosing a schwarzschild hole .",
    "one would thus expect to obtain the corresponding partition function from it by the prescription @xmath11 . as mentioned above",
    ", the only obstacle to this calculation is the lack of knowledge about the density of states of the system , which is needed to evaluate the trace .",
    "however , as we discuss in the next subsection , there is another hamiltonian associated with the schwarzschild spacetime that allows us to obtain the relevant partition function without euclideanization .",
    "this is the louko - whiting hamiltonian .      in their quest to obtain the partition function for the schwarzschild black hole in the hamiltonian formulation",
    ", lw found a hamiltonian that time - evolves spatial hypersurfaces in a schwarzschild spacetime of mass @xmath15 such that the hypersurfaces extend from the bifurcation 2-sphere to a timelike box - trajectory placed at a constant curvature radius of @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "as we will show in the next subsection , the lw hamiltonian describes the correct free energy of a schwarzschild black hole enclosed inside a box in the thermodynamical picture .",
    "the lw hamiltonian is @xmath21 where generically @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions of time @xmath24 , which labels the spatial hypersurfaces .",
    "physically , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the time - time component of the spacetime metric on the box . on the other hand , the physical meaning of @xmath23 is as follows . on a classical solution ,",
    "consider the future timelike unit normal @xmath27 to a constant @xmath24 hypersurface at the bifurcation two - sphere ( see fig .",
    "then @xmath23 is the rate at which the constant @xmath24 hypersurfaces are boosted at the bifurcation 2-sphere : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the initial hypersurface and @xmath30 is the boosted hypersurface .",
    "if one is restricted to a foliation in which the spatial hypersurfaces approach the box along surfaces of constant proper time on the box , then @xmath31 .",
    "on classical solutions , the spatial hypersurfaces approach the bifurcation 2-sphere along constant killing - time hypersurfaces ( see the paragraph containing eqs .",
    "( [ ls - r ] ) in section [ subsec : lwgeoham ] ) . the lw fall - off conditions ( [ ls - r ] ) , which are imposed on the adm variables at the bifurcation 2-sphere , can be used to show that on solutions , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the killing time and @xmath34 is the surface gravity of a schwarzschild black hole . in the particular case where the label time @xmath24 is taken to be the proper time on the box , we have @xmath35^{-1 } \\ \\ .\\ ] ] with such an identification of the label time @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ lwht ] ) shows that on classical solutions the time - evolution of these spatial hypersurfaces is given by the hamiltonian @xmath36 where @xmath23 is given by ( [ n0sol ] ) .",
    "one may now ask if one can use the lw hamiltonian ( [ lwh ] ) to obtain a partition function for the system and study its thermodynamical properties .",
    "unfortunately , one can not do so in a straightforward manner .",
    "first , one can not replace @xmath3 in ( [ partition - trace ] ) by @xmath9 , the quantum counterpart of ( [ lwh ] ) , to obtain the partition function .",
    "the reason is that classically @xmath37 does not give the correct energy of the system ; the by hamiltonian @xmath12 of ( [ quasih ] ) does . to avoid this problem , lw first construct the schrdinger time - evolution operator @xmath38 .",
    "they then euclideanize this operator and use it to obtain the partition function @xmath39 . the partition function so obtained does not equal @xmath40 , but rather it turns out to be the same as that obtained via the path integral approach of gibbons and hawking @xcite .",
    "however , apart from this end result , a justification at some fundamental level has been lacking as to why the lw hamiltonian ( [ lwh ] ) and not any other hamiltonian ( eg . , ( [ quasih ] ) ) should be used to obtain the partition function using the lw procedure .    in the next subsection , we will find the thermodynamical roles played by the by and lw hamiltonians .",
    "we will also show how this helps us in obtaining the partition function without euclideanization . this way we will avoid the ambiguity mentioned above that arises in the lw - method of constructing the partition function .",
    "as argued by brown and york @xcite , on solutions , the by hamiltonian @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ quasih ] ) denotes the internal energy @xmath41 residing within the box : @xmath42 in fact eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) can be shown to yield the first law of black hole thermodynamics @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the surface pressure on the box - wall @xcite @xmath45 the first term on the rhs of ( [ de ] ) is negative of the amount of work done by the system on its surroundings and , with hindsight , the second term is the product @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the temperature and @xmath48 is the entropy of the system .",
    "we will not assume the latter in the following analysis ; rather we will deduce the form of @xmath47 and @xmath48 from first principles .",
    "we next show that the lw hamiltonian @xmath37 of eq .",
    "( [ lwh ] ) plays the role of helmholtz free energy of the system .",
    "recall that the helmholtz free energy @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50 where @xmath41 is the internal energy .",
    "thus in an isothermal and reversible process , the first law of thermodynamics implies that the amount of mechanical work done by a system , @xmath51 , is equal to the decrease in its free energy , i.e. , @xmath52 as a corollary to this statement it follows that for a mechanically isolated system at a constant temperature , the state of equilibrium is the state of minimum free energy .",
    "we now show that under certain conditions on the foliation of the spacetime with spatial hypersurfaces , the lw hamiltonian @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ lwh ] ) plays the role of _",
    "free energy_. we choose a foliation such that on solutions the lapse @xmath23 obeys ( [ n0sol ] ) . using the expression ( [ e ] ) for @xmath41 , the hamiltonian @xmath37 in eq . ( [ lwh ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath53 now let us perturb @xmath37 about a solution by perturbing @xmath15 and @xmath16 such that @xmath23 itself is held fixed .",
    "then @xmath54 note that keeping @xmath23 fixed , i.e. , @xmath55 , does not necessarily imply through ( [ n0sol ] ) that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are not independent perturbations .",
    "this is because , in general , the perturbed @xmath37 may not correspond to a solution and hence the perturbed @xmath23 need not have the form ( [ n0sol ] ) .",
    "however , here we will assume that the perturbations do not take us off the space of static solutions and , therefore , the perturbed @xmath23 has the form ( [ n0sol ] ) .",
    "hence in our case @xmath58 and @xmath57 are not independent perturbations . using ( [ de ] ) and ( [ n0sol ] ) in ( [ dhitode ] ) yields",
    "@xmath59 finally , from ( [ dhdw ] ) and ( [ fw ] ) we get @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant independent of @xmath15 .",
    "to find @xmath61 , we take the limit @xmath62 . in this limit",
    "both @xmath37 and @xmath49 vanish and , therefore , @xmath61 has to be zero .",
    "another way to see that @xmath61 should vanish is to identify the geometric quantity @xmath23 with the temperature , @xmath47 , of the system ( up to a multiplicative constant )",
    ". then the perturbation ( [ dhitode ] ) in @xmath37 , keeping @xmath23 ( and , therefore , @xmath47 ) fixed , describes an isothermal process .",
    "but eq . ( [ hfc ] ) shows that @xmath61 has to be an extensive function of thermodynamic invariants of the isothermal process since @xmath37 and @xmath49 are both extensive .",
    "the only thermodynamic quantity that we assume to be invariant in this isothermal process is the temperature @xmath47 .",
    "but since @xmath47 is not extensive , @xmath61 has to be zero .",
    "the fact that @xmath23 indeed determines the temperature of the system will be discussed in detail in a later section .",
    "the above proof of the lw hamiltonian being the helmholtz free energy immediately allows us to calculate the partition function for a canonical ensemble of such systems , @xmath63 by simply putting @xmath64 . in this way we recover the thermodynamical properties of a schwarzschild black hole without euclideanization .",
    "we will do so in detail in section [ geothermo ] but first we establish the geometrical significance of by and lw hamiltonians in the next section .",
    "a study of the geometrical roles of the by and lw hamiltonians provides the geometrical basis for the thermodynamical parameters associated with a black hole that were discussed in the preceeding section . in this section",
    "we begin by setting up the hamiltonian formulation appropriate for the two sets of boundary conditions that lead to the by and lw hamiltonians as being the unconstrained hamiltonians that generate time - evolution of foliations in schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the notation follows that of kucha @xcite and lw .    a general spherically symmetric spacetime metric on the manifold @xmath65 can be written in the adm form as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are functions of @xmath24 and @xmath71 only , and @xmath72 is the metric on the unit two - sphere .",
    "we will choose our boundary conditions in such a way that the radial proper distance @xmath73 on the constant @xmath24 surfaces is finite .",
    "this implies that the radial coordinate @xmath71 have a finite range , which we take to be @xmath74 $ ] , without any loss of generality .",
    "the spatial metric and the spacetime metric will be assumed to be nondegenerate , in particular , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath67 are taken to be positive .    for the metric ( [ 4-metric ] ) , the einstein - hilbert action is @xmath75 & & \\nonumber \\\\",

    "above , the overdot and the prime denote @xmath77  and   @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the equations of motion derived from ( [ s - lag ] ) are the full einstein equations for the metric  ( [ 4-metric ] ) , and they imply that every classical solution is part of a maximally extended schwarzschild spacetime , where the value of the schwarzschild mass @xmath79 may be positive , negative , or zero . in what follows , we will choose our boundary conditions such that @xmath80 .",
    "we shall discuss the boundary conditions and the boundary terms after passing to the hamiltonian formulation .",
    "the momenta conjugate to @xmath69 and @xmath70 are found from the lagrangian action  ( [ s - lag ] ) to be    @xmath81    a dual - legendre transformation then yields the hamiltonian action @xmath82 = \\int dt \\int_0 ^ 1 dr \\left ( p_\\lambda { \\dot \\lambda } + p_r { \\dot r } - nh - n^r h_r \\right ) \\ \\ , \\label{s - ham}\\ ] ] where the super - hamiltonian @xmath83 and the radial supermomentum @xmath84 are    @xmath85    it can be verified that the poisson brackets of the constraints close according to the radial version of the dirac algebra @xcite .",
    "we next consider the boundary terms that must be added to the hypersurface action ( [ canhypaction ] ) for the total action to yield , upon variation , only a volume term corresponding to the equations of motion .",
    "however , the boundary terms depend intricately on the choice of the spacetime foliation .",
    "different foliations require different boundary conditions on the geometric variables in the variational analysis , thus requiring the addition of different boundary terms to ( [ canhypaction ] ) .",
    "as is well known in general relativity , it is these boundary terms that determine the true hamiltonian of the system .",
    "hence , as we show below explicitly , this implies that different foliations correspond to different hamiltonians , which are the generators of time - evolution of the spatial slices in the foliations .      in general , the analysis of brown and york ( see subsection [ subsec : byham ] ) breaks down in cases where spacetime regions of non - trivial topologies are enclosed inside the spherical box , particularly so in the case of a schwarzschild black hole enclosed inside the box .",
    "as we show below , in this case one is forced to introduce an `` inner''-boundary where the spatial hypersurfaces of brown and york must extend to .",
    "this fact becomes transparent when one looks at the full kruskal extension of the schwarzschild metric .",
    "there , one begins by performing a @xmath86 decomposition of the spacetime in terms of a one - parameter family of spatial hypersurfaces . the kruskal diagram ( see figs",
    ". 2 and 3 ) shows that any such foliation would necessarily require two boundaries : an outer boundary and an inner boundary .",
    "the hamiltonian that evolves these spatial hypersurfaces in time will in general depend on the boundary conditions specified on these 2-boundaries . in this section",
    "we show that the spatial hypersurfaces that are evolved by the hamiltonian corresponding to the quasilocal energy , given in ( [ quasih ] ) , are ones that extend from the box ( the outer timelike boundary ) , on the right end , to an inner timelike boundary located completely inside the dynamical region of the kruskal diagram , on the left end .",
    "we first find the boundary conditions and the foliation that correspond to time evolution by the by hamiltonian and later we compare these with those corresponding to the lw hamiltonian . at @xmath87 ,",
    "we prescribe the following fall - off conditions    [ s - r ] @xmath88    where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are positive .",
    "this ensures that on classical solutions @xmath79 is positive .",
    "also @xmath91 .",
    "here @xmath92 stands for a term whose magnitude at @xmath93 is bounded by @xmath94 times a constant , and whose @xmath95th derivative at @xmath93 is similarly bounded by @xmath96 times a constant for @xmath97 .",
    "the fact that the shift @xmath98 vanishes as @xmath99 implies that on solutions , the inner timelike boundary lies along a constant killing - time surface located completely in the past and the future dynamical regions and cutting across the bifurcation two - sphere . also , on solutions , the variable @xmath90 corresponds to the throat - radius .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the conditions ( [ s - r ] ) are consistent with the equations of motion : provided that the constraints obey @xmath100 and the fall - off conditions ( [ s - r - lambda])([s - r - pr ] ) hold for the initial data , and provided that the lapse and shift satisfy ( [ s - r - n ] ) and  ( [ s - r - nr ] ) , it then follows that the fall - off conditions ( [ s - r - lambda])([s - r - pr ] ) are preserved in time by the time - evolution equations .    on the other hand , at @xmath101 , the boundary conditions are as follows : we fix @xmath70 and @xmath102 to be prescribed positive - valued functions of  @xmath24 .",
    "this means fixing the metric on the three - surface @xmath101 to be timelike . in the classical solutions ,",
    "the surface @xmath101 is located in the right exterior region of the kruskal extension of the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we now give an action principle appropriate for these boundary conditions .",
    "to begin , note that the surface action @xmath103 $ ] in ( [ s - ham ] ) is well defined under the above conditions .",
    "consider the total action @xmath104 = s_\\sigma [ \\lambda , r , p_\\lambda , p_r ; n , n^r ] + s_{\\partial\\sigma } [ \\lambda , r , p_\\lambda , p_r ; n , n^r ] \\ \\ , \\label{s - total}\\ ] ] where the boundary action is given by @xmath105 \\nonumber \\\\ & & = \\int dt { \\biggl [ n r r ' \\lambda^{-1 } - n^r \\lambda p_\\lambda - \\case{1}{2 } r { \\dot r } \\ln \\left| { n + \\lambda n^r \\over   n - \\lambda n^r } \\right| \\biggr]}_{r=1 } \\ \\ , \\label{s - boundary}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106_a$ ] is value of the _ term _ evaluated at @xmath107 .",
    "the variation of the total action ( [ s - total ] ) can be written as a sum of a volume term proportional to the equations of motion , boundary terms from the initial and final spatial surfaces , and boundary terms from @xmath87 and @xmath101 .",
    "the boundary terms from the initial and final spatial surfaces take the usual form @xmath108 with the upper ( lower ) sign corresponding to the final ( initial ) surface .",
    "these terms vanish provided we fix the initial and final three - metrics . the boundary term from @xmath87 vanishes under the fall - off conditions specified in ( [ s - r ] ) . as will be shown in subsection [ subsec : reduction ] ,",
    "this is crucial in obtaining a reduced hamiltonian that corresponds to the correct quasilocal energy .",
    "the boundary term from @xmath101 reads @xmath109}_{r=1 } \\ \\ . \\label{bt-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath70 and @xmath110 are fixed at @xmath101 , the first three terms in ( [ bt-1 ] ) vanish .",
    "the integrand in the last term in ( [ bt-1 ] ) is proportional to the equation of motion  ( [ plambda ] ) , which is classically enforced for @xmath111 by the volume term in the variation of the action .",
    "therefore , for classical solutions , also the last term in ( [ bt-1 ] ) will vanish by continuity .",
    "thus the action ( [ s - total ] ) is appropriate for a variational principle which fixes the initial and final three - metrics , and the three - metric on the timelike boundary at @xmath101 .",
    "each classical solution belongs to that region of a kruskal diagram that lies within two timelike boundaries such that the inner boundary lies along a constant killing - time surface located completely in the dynamical regions and the outer boundary is a timelike surface located in the right exterior region ( see fig .",
    "the constant @xmath24 slices are spacelike everywhere between the two timelike boundaries .      to obtain the reduced action and extract the unconstrained hamiltonian system one needs to first solve the constraints ( [ superham ] ) and ( [ supermom ] ) . in the following , we will follow kucha s way of handling the constraints @xcite .",
    "it was shown by kucha that in the context of a vacuum schwarzschild spacetime ( in the absence of timelike boundaries ) there exists a set of new variables , which are related to the adm variables through a canonical transformation , such that in terms of the new variables the constraints are remarkably simple and solvable .",
    "this allows one to perform a hamiltonian reduction . in this section",
    "we show that the canonical transformation given by kucha from the adm variables @xmath112 to the new variables @xmath113 is readily adapted to our boundary conditions . as mentioned earlier",
