    "sub - stellar companions like brown dwarfs and giant planets are hard to find due to the problem of dynamic range : faint objects very close to much brighter stars .",
    "all very nearby stars , within @xmath0 , are @xmath1 gyr old .",
    "one way around this problem is to search for sub - stellar companion candidates around very young relatively nearby stars .",
    "there are indeed young nearby stars , like gj 182 ( @xmath2 myrs at 27 pc ) , the tucanae and hora groups of young zero - age main - sequence stars , the tw hya association ( twa ) of about one dozen pre - main sequence stars isolated from cloud material , and the mbm 12 cloud at @xmath3 with several classical and weak - line t tauri stars .",
    "we have started a direct imaging search for sub - stellar companions around those young nearby stars : up to 100 myrs and up to 100 pc .",
    "including new nearby stars discovered recently among rosat x - ray sources , there are more than 100 such stars known to date .",
    "we use the infrared imaging camera sofi at the eso 3.5 m ntt on la silla , the mpe speckle camera sharp ( also used at ntt ) , the infrared imager and spectrograph isaac at the eso 8.2 m antu ( vlt - ut1 ) on cerro paranal , and the adaptive optics infrared instrument alfa on the calar alto 3.5 m telescope . for companions candidates found in the 1st epoch imaging ,",
    "we then take a 2nd epoch image one or a few years later for proper motion confirmation and/or an infrared spectrum to confirm or reject their sub - stellar nature .",
    "five sub - stellar companions have been confirmed so far by both spectroscopy and proper motion : after gl  229  b , g  196 - 3  b , and gl  570  d , the two youngest brown dwarf companions known so far were confirmed by us using spectroscopy and proper motion , namely cod@xmath4  b in twa ( neuhuser et al .",
    "2000b ) and hr  7329  b in tucanae ( guenther et al . 2001 ) .",
    "a giant planet candidate near twa-7 ( neuhuser et al .",
    "2000a ) has been found to be a background k - type star in an h - band spectrum taken with isaac at the vlt ( neuhuser et al .",
    "2001 ) .    here",
    ", we report on three more sub - stellar companion candidates found by direct imaging near three other twa members .",
    "using the infrared imager son of isaac ( sofi ) at the eso 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) on la silla we took images of several twa members .",
    "the observations were made on 2000 may 17 and 19 with 1.0 `` to 1.1 '' seeing .",
    "we used the h - band filter and the small sofi field ( 0.147\" / pix ) with a total exposure time of 10 min per target ( @xmath5 sec in auto - jitter mode ) .",
    "darks , flats , and standard stars were taken in the same night , and we performed standard data reduction with _ eclipse _ and midas .",
    "we found new companion candidates around twa-8 ( a twa t tauri star found by webb et al .",
    "1999 ) , rxj1121.1 - 3845 ( = gsc 7739 2190 ) , and rxj1121.3 - 3447 ( = gsc 7210 1352 ) , originally found as new t tauri stars by w. hoff ( phd thesis ) and published by sterzik et al . ( 1999 ) , data are listed in table 1 .",

    "the companion candidate to rxj1121.1 - 3845 was found also by d. trilling & r. jayawardhana using the cold coronograph coco at the nasa irtf ( priv . com . ) .",
    "if the companion candidates would be bound , i.e. at @xmath9 and @xmath10 myrs as twa , their magnitudes would correspond to objects with only a few jupiter masses , according to different sub - stellar tracks and isochrones , i.e. they would be sub - stellar .",
    "we took follow - up h - band spectra using isaac at antu ( vlt - ut1 ) and found that all three companion candidates are unrelated background stars ( to be reported in more detail later ) .",
