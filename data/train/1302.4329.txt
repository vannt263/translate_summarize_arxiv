    "in the 1980s , the voyager 2 spacecraft gave us a better knowledge of uranus and its satellites ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it revealed in particular that miranda and ariel have been resurfaced .",
    "moreover , orbital models compared to astrometric observations showed that miranda had a significant inclination @xmath3 , of the order of @xmath4 among gust86@xcite .",
    "these facts induced several dynamical studies in the late 1980s and early 1990s @xcite showing that the current inclination of miranda is probably due to a former 3:1 resonance with umbriel . indeed , tidal interactions with uranus are supposed to push the satellites outward , meeting orbital resonances .",
    "once the system is trapped into this 3:1 resonance , the inclination of miranda is pumped and the amplitude of libration of the resonant argument rises as the trajectory meets several secondary resonances .",
    "the capture in one of these resonances leads the trajectory to the edge of the primary resonance involving the exit of this latter .",
    "eventually , the inclination of miranda ceases to be pumped and the 2  satellites restart to migrate independently of each other .",
    "this scenario of evolution has been intensively studied by the above authors . with this work",
    ", we confirm the ideas developed in the past and introduce modern numerical tools to update the problem .",
    "the reason is that there is a renewal of interest these last years for the uranian system .",
    "first , the hubble space telescope allowed the discovery of a whole system of rings and inner satellites ( see e.g. @xcite ) , whose dynamics is of course widely influenced by the main satellites .",
    "these inner satellites present interesting dynamical configurations and mysteries , as for instance the poorly understood dynamics of mab @xcite or the instability of cupid , belinda , cressida and desdemona on a time scale of @xmath5 years @xcite .",
    "secondly , a new scenario has recently been proposed by @xcite to explain the huge obliquity of uranus ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this scenario involves a former giant satellite , whose gravitational torque was strong enough to tilt the planet @xcite .",
    "we can also mention the work of @xcite showing that the presence of the current main satellites is consistent with the migration of uranus as predicted by the nice model .",
    "finally , uranus and its satellites are the target of the proposal of a space mission uranus pathfinder @xcite .",
    "for all of these reasons , we propose to revisit the dynamical history of the main uranian satellites with powerful numerical means and tools , such as frequency analysis @xcite and the megno chaos indicator @xcite .",
    "this article is split into the following sections .",
    "first the key features of the system are summarised ( cfr . section  [ s : key_features ] ) .",
    "we present the system and the mean motion resonance 3:1 between miranda and umbriel that the system should have encountered in its history .",
    "the details of the initial conditions used throughout this study are given in order to group the information needed to redo the numerical analysis .",
    "secondly , based primarily on the work of @xcite and @xcite , we present the full hamiltonian ( cfr . section  [ s : p1 ] ) and its averaged form ( cfr . section  [ s : p2 ] ) .",
    "these two sections remind the description of the system via hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the introduction of canonical variables as delaunay variables allows us to develop a perturbative theory and to obtain an hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom ( angle - action ) by averaging over the fast angles .",
    "we also introduce the equations related to the tidal effects in the two models .",
    "we then present the new numerical tools implemented to study the system .",
    "the numerical integrations of the full system on a sufficient large time scale were a major problem in the previous studies .",
    "we perform numerical integrations over @xmath7 myr on the system of uranus with its five main satellites and confirm previous results .",
    "we use numerical tools like the chaos detector megno to represent the global dynamics of the system ( cfr .",
    "section [ s : numerical_methods ] ) .",
    "we also improve the resolution and the details of the maps by studying the variations of the orbital elements involved in the mean motion resonance .",
    "these scales are introduced in the section [ s : numerical_methods ] and the results on the system are summarised in the section [ s : results ] .",
    "these new tools allow us to extend previous studies by the introduction of new visualisations of the phase plane of the considered problem .",
    "we show that the combination of numerical methods like chaos maps and frequency analysis ( cfr .",
    "section [ s : results ] ) allows to detect some particular behaviours of the system .",
    "we find two regions surrounding the center of libration where two secondary resonances are superimposed .",
    "the choice of the initial condition for a trajectory is then primordial for the future of the system : the combination of the two secondary resonances tends to increase the chaos and to result in another scenario than the exit at @xmath1 for the inclination of miranda .",
    "this is a part of our conclusions and perspectives presented in the last section [ s : conclusionsandperspectives ] .",
    "the system of uranus has five main satellites , from closest to farthest with respect to uranus ; miranda , ariel , umbriel , titania and oberon .",
    "although these satellites are not currently locked into orbital resonances , there are many clues indicating probable passages through mean motion resonances in the past : we observe important resurfacings of miranda and ariel and some abnormalities in the current orbital elements . in view of these orbital elements of the satellites , in particular the high inclination of miranda ( cfr .",
    "table [ orbital_elements_satellites ] ) , we analyse a mean motion resonance acting on the inclinations . the first one encountered by the system in the past is the mean motion resonance miranda - umbriel 3:1 defined by 6 possible resonant arguments : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      + where @xmath8 stands for @xmath9 or @xmath10 for miranda or umbriel respectively . the variable @xmath11 is the value of @xmath12 at the exact resonance. the hamiltonian in these canonical variables is defined by @xmath13 where the @xmath14 are constant coefficients defined by @xcite .",
    "introducing the couple angle - action @xmath15 we show that at the equilibrium @xmath16 , @xmath17  : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are constant defined in @xcite .",
    "we compare this circulation frequency to the circulation frequency of @xmath20 and @xmath21    the expressions of the constants are given by the authors @xcite and note that the dominant term is the constant @xmath22 .",
    "we show that the two different frequencies are different and can thus quantitatively distinguish the two secondary resonances .",
    "in this work , we focus on the mean motion resonance 3:1 between miranda and umbriel and try to explain the high inclination of miranda .",
    "this problem was studied by numerous authors twenty years ago but the update of some results with new numerical tools gives new views of it .",
    "we retrieve the main results than these authors and improve the understanding of the problem with new powerful methods .",
    "the chaos detector megno has never been applied in the case of the main satellites of uranus .",
    "we show that the combination of the chaos detector and the orbital element maps brings a new visualisation of the phase planes of the problem .",
    "the use of maps and frequency analysis on particular trajectories allows the detection of unusual zones in these phase planes where two secondary resonances are combined and dominate the future evolution .",
    "we show that sometimes , a trajectory could be captured in two secondary resonances in a same time : a 2/1 secondary resonance with the circulation argument of @xmath23 and a 4/1 secondary resonance with the circulation argument of @xmath24 , the two being very close .",
    "following the toy model of @xcite , we derive an analytical expression for a circulation frequency @xmath25 for the primary resonant argument in libration needed to compare with the other arguments in circulation .",
    "we find two different commensurabilities and can therefore distinguish the two secondary resonances .",
    "the mix of these two secondary resonances increases the chaos and leads to another scenario for the evolution of the system with an exit of the primary resonance higher than @xmath1 .",
    "the dynamical aspects of the uranian system are numerous and full of interest . in the future",
    ", we will study a combination of this dynamical model with an intern evolution of the satellites .",
    "this combination is interesting by many points but the main one according to us is the understanding of a dynamical abnormality ( high inclination of miranda ) and a geological anomaly ( differentiation of miranda ) through a resonance phenomenon .",
