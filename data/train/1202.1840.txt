    "the 21  cm neutral hydrogen emission line has proven an extremely useful diagnostic of the interstellar medium of our own and nearby galaxies since its first observation by @xcite and @xcite . and despite the fact that it was soon recognised @xcite that this transition could have significant opacity under interstellar conditions , it has often proven convenient to neglect that possibility when estimating the total mass of galaxies or the statistical properties of the neutral interstellar medium .",
    "opacity estimation is straightforward in directions toward bright , compact background continuum sources , but is considerably more challenging to determine when based on the emission spectrum alone @xcite .",
    "a finite line opacity will cause systematic changes to the shape of emission spectra that can be used to estimate opacity for simple media and viewing geometries .",
    "line - of - sight confusion encountered when viewing edge - on systems presents a very serious challenge to such an analysis given the likelihood for discrete features to overlap in both position and velocity .",
    "this has precluded detailed opacity modelling of the galactic neutral hydrogen emission near and in the plane . only by assuming a single universal effective temperature for all the in the galaxy have some crude opacity corrections been made ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first detailed opacity modelling of the emission in an external galaxy has recently been undertaken by @xcite within m31 .",
    "this was enabled by achieving 100  pc linear and 2  km  s@xmath10  spectral resolution at sub - kelvin brightness sensitivity .",
    "high quality fits to individual spectra based on a physical model were possible over the majority of the disk , with the exception of those regions where the `` warping '' phenomenon of the outer disk leads to line - of - sight confusion .",
    "that study determined that opacity corrections could locally exceed an order of magnitude in the implied column density and that these resulted in a 30% increase in the global mass estimate . but how representative are these values and to what extent are they influenced by the relatively high mean inclination , @xmath11 , of the m31 disk or the finite spatial resolution ?    in this paper we extend the analysis of @xcite to the two other external galaxies for which the requisite physical resolution and sensitivity in the 21  cm emission line are available , m33 and the lmc .",
    "these galaxies have the virtue of a much more favorable disk orientation , with inclinations of about @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the extreme proximity of the lmc also permits linear scales as small as 15  pc to be probed with good sensitivity .",
    "although small , this sample permits some general conclusions to be drawn regarding the statistical occurrence of opaque 21  cm emission and column densities .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the observations and their reduction in  [ sec : obse ] and continue with their opacity analysis in  [ sec : anis ] . in  [ sec : disc ] we present a statistical analysis of the occurrence of opacity corrected column density within all three galaxies and put these in a cosmological context by considering the prospects for detection of intervening 21  cm absorbers toward distant background sources .",
    "we assume a distance to of 785  kpc @xcite , to of 794  kpc @xcite and to the of 51  kpc @xcite throughout .",
    "we further adopt a flat cosmological model with @xmath14  =  0.73 and a hubble constant of 71  km  s@xmath10mpc@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the observations and data reduction methods relevant to m31 are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the most relevant aspects are the high quality total power data obtained with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) as described by @xcite combined with a 163 pointing mosaic obtained with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in its `` maxi - short '' configuration .",
    "the data cube used for the spectral modeling analysis had angular resolution of 30  ( 114  pc ) , velocity resolution of 2.27  km  s@xmath10  and rms noise level of 1.0 k per channel .",
    "the relevant data attributes are summarized in table  [ tab : parms ] .",
    "total power observations of a @xmath15 region centered on m33 were carried out with the gbt during 2002 october using the same setup described by @xcite for the observations of m31 .",
    "interferometric data was acquired with the very large array ( vla ) in 1997 , 1998 and 2001 under the proposal ids at206 and at268 .",
    "this consisted of a six pointing mosaic in the b and cs configurations and an additional 20 pointing mosaic in the d configuration .",
    "some early results based on the b and cs configuration data were presented in @xcite while an independent reduction of all three vla configurations has been presented by @xcite .",
    "joint deconvolution of all of the vla pointing data was carried out after inclusion of the appropriately scaled gbt total power images following the method employed for the reduction of the m31 data described in detail by @xcite . the data cube used for the spectral modeling analysis",
    "had angular resolution of 20  ( 77  pc ) , velocity resolution of 1.42  km  s@xmath10  and rms noise level of 2.1  k per channel .",
    "the observations and data reduction methods relevant to lmc are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the most relevant aspects are the total power data obtained with the parkes telescope and its multi - beam 21  cm receiver combined with a 1344 pointing mosaic obtained with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in its 750a , 750c and 750d configurations . the data cube used for the spectral modeling analysis had angular resolution of 60  ( 15  pc ) , velocity resolution of 1.65  km  s@xmath10  and rms noise level of 2.5  k per channel .",

    "the things survey @xcite consists of imaging of 34 relatively nearby galaxies using multiple configurations of the vla .",
    "although this survey achieves an angular resolution as high as 6  arcsec , which corresponds to less than 150  pc for the thirteen things galaxies within about 4  mpc , the corresponding rms brightness sensitivity per velocity channel varies between about 10 and 20  k at this angular resolution while the velocity resolution is too coarse for several of the galaxies ( 5.2  km  s@xmath10 ) and only marginal ( 2.6  km  s@xmath10 ) for the remainder . as will become apparent below , parameterised spectral fitting is only found to be viable when at least one independent velocity channel exceeds 10@xmath16 and at least five exceed 5@xmath16 .",
    "for this reason it is vital to achieve better than about 2  k brightness sensitivity over 2  km  s@xmath10  at the required physical resolution of about 100  pc that matches intrinsic structure sizes .",
    "the things survey has insufficient sensitivity by a factor of between 5 and 10 for this purpose .",
    "remedying this shortcoming would require between 25 and 100 times longer integrations , or between 250 and 1000 hours per target with the evla .",
    "another ongoing survey of nearby galaxies that might be considered of potential relevance is the halogas survey of @xcite .",
    "that survey involves relatively deep ( 120 hours per target ) observations of a galaxy sample within about 10  mpc .",
    "unfortunately , as that survey is designed primarily to detect diffuse gas in the extended environments of galaxies it has only modest physical ( about 1  kpc ) and velocity ( 4.2  km  s@xmath10 ) resolution that make it unsuitable for parameterised spectral fitting of well - resolved structures .",
    "the method of spectral analysis has been described in detail in @xcite .",
    "we repeat the most relevant aspects of that analysis below for clarity .",
    "each line profile is modeled as a spatially resolved _",
    "isothermal  _ feature in the _ presence of turbulent broadening  _ as @xmath17\\ } \\label{eqn : tb}\\ ] ] with @xmath18 where the velocity dispersion , @xmath16 , has units of km  s@xmath10  and is the quadratic sum of an assumed thermal and nonthermal contribution @xmath19 with the thermal contribution given by @xmath20 , for a kinetic temperature , @xmath21 .",
    "such profiles have a gaussian shape for low ratios of the column density ( in units of @xmath1 ) to spin temperature , @xmath22 , but become increasingly flat - topped when this ratio becomes high .",
    "we found the best - fitting model spectrum for the brightest spectral feature along each line - of - sight when the observed peak brightness temperature exceeded 10 times the rms noise and the truncated peak ( where brightnesses greater than 50% of the peak were encountered ) spanned at least five independent velocity channels .",
    "the requirement for a well - sampled linewidth translates directly into one on the velocity resolution of the input galaxy data of better than about 2  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the truncation was done to both isolate single spectral components from possibly blended features as well as eliminating potential broad wings from the fit . in this way ,",
    "the broad wings of secondary components along the same line of sight , for example from additional warm neutral gas with @xmath23  k temperature , could be excluded from the fit .",
    "the data were compared to a pre - calculated set of model spectra spanning the range log(n@xmath6 ) = 20.0 to 23.5 by 0.01 , log(t@xmath24 ) = 1.2 to 3.2 by 0.01 and log(@xmath25 ) = 0.3 to 1.5 by 0.04 . a search in velocity offset",
    "was done over displacements of @xmath264 to + 4 by 1  km  s@xmath10  with respect to the line centroid as estimated by the first moment of each truncated peak .",
    "only those fits with a normalized @xmath27 were retained ; a cut - off based on the rejection level needed within m31 to exclude instances of line blending where the outer `` warp '' is seen in projection against the inner disk . in the case of m31 this resulted in rejection of some 4% of the fits , while for both m33 and the lmc the fit rejection rate dropped to below 1% .",
    "results of the spectral fitting were recorded as images of the physical parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath25 together with the integral of brightness temperature over velocity that corresponds to the column density of the fit , @xmath29 .",
    "this allowed calculation of a total corrected column density image from , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is just the usual image of integrated emission .",
    "those lines - of - sight with insufficient fit quality ( @xmath32 ) or insufficient peak brightness and width ( at least one independent velocity channel exceeding 10@xmath16 and at least five exceeding 5@xmath16 ) were assumed to have negligible opacity and simply assigned the optically thin value .",
    "we present images of the opacity corrected neutral hydrogen column density in figures  [ fig : m31nhc][fig : lmcnhc ] .",
    "in contrast to images of the apparent column density , @xmath34 , which saturate below 10@xmath35  @xmath1 into an almost featureless fog , there is widespread fine structure that extends to about 10@xmath0  @xmath1 .",
    "it is interesting to note that comparably high columns have been observed in the lyman alpha absorption spectra of high redshift grbs @xcite .",
    "this contrast is illustrated in figure  [ fig : lmcnhcz ] where the corrected and apparent distributions are shown side by side for a region in the southeastern quadrant of the lmc that includes 30 doradus ( near ( @xmath36)=(05:40,@xmath2669:00 ) ) .",
    "this figure also serves to demonstrate the exceptional detail provided by the lmc linear resolution of only 15  pc .",
    "while many of the high column density features in m31 and m33 are only marginally resolved with 100  pc resolution , the majority of the lmc features are well - resolved into structures that have coherent derived properties , despite the fact that every line - of - sight has been independently fit with a model spectrum .",
    "the corrected total masses exceed those that follow from the assumption of negligible 21  cm opacity by factors of 1.30 , 1.36 and 1.33 for m31 , m33 and the lmc respectively .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the m31 value may be biased to a lower value since some portions of the disk are confused by the warp and could not be adequately modeled .",
    "although our sample of galaxies with opacity - corrected column densities is very small , it does sample both the mass density peak and the highly populated tail of the mass function @xcite with apparent values of @xmath37  =  9.77 , 9.13 and 8.61 . and",
    "while all three galaxies are of moderately late type , the same is true of about 90% of galaxies within the complete hipass sample @xcite both by their contribution to the total mass and in terms of space density .",
    "if these global correction factors are representative of galaxies in general , they suggest that the estimated redshift zero mass density , @xmath33 , determined from unbiased surveys of emission from galaxies in the local universe requires this magnitude of upward correction . taking the average of the hipass determined value @xcite and the recent alfalfa value @xcite after converting both to the assumed cosmology and scaling up by an opacity correction factor of 1.34@xmath20.05 yields @xmath38  =  5.6@xmath39 .    the existence of additional gas , in excess of that inferred from the published 21  cm and co data has been previously suggested by @xcite in the case of the lmc from what has been termed `` excess fir '' emission .",
    "those authors have demonstrated that the dust optical depth is enhanced in regions of the highest apparent column density consistent with approximately twice the total gas mass being present . the opaque 21  cm emission that we document appears to account for some 35% of this fir excess .",
    "this cool atomic hydrogen gas will likely be closely associated with diffuse molecular hydrogen gas that may be deficient in co emission relative to the high density , self - gravitating molecular clouds that are generally used to calibrate the co to h@xmath40 conversion factor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a detailed analysis of atomic , molecular and dust tracers in the lmc , including our opacity - corrected results will be presented in @xcite .",
    "it has been recognised for some time that images of 21  cm emission from nearby galaxies can be used to construct a distribution function that documents the probability to intercept a particular column density on a random line - of - sight . the first application of this approach @xcite employed the assumption that the apparent mass was distributed smoothly over a typical size that depends on galaxy type .",
    "subsequent studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) have made use of interferometric images to estimate the areal coverage of specific column densities , but even these have been limited to a median physical resolution of some 1.4  kpc and no ability to correct for 21  cm opacity effects .",
    "most recently , @xcite have used the things galaxy images to this end , despite the fact that those data have only marginal resolution and inadequate sensitivity to enable resolved opacity corrections to be made , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : addt ] above .",
    "we have used the opacity corrected column density images ( figs.[fig : m31nhc][fig : lmcnhc ] ) together with the sensitive wide - field total power 21  cm emission data from the combined m31/m33 system @xcite and deep gbt imaging of the m31 environment @xcite to construct the distribution function shown in figure  [ fig : fnhc ] that spans more than six orders of magnitude in column density from 10@xmath41  10@xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "the curves in figure  [ fig : fnhc ] were calculated from , @xmath42 where x represents unit co - moving depth along the line - of - sight , @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the space density of galaxies with an _ apparent _ ( i.e. uncorrected for opacity effects )",

    "[ fig : m31nhc][fig : lmcnhc ] . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the distribution function without opacity correction as the dark dot - dash curve in the figure .",
    "the uncorrected data show an exponential upper cut - off that precludes column densities as large as 10@xmath35@xmath1 .",
    "the opacity corrected data show an approximate power law extension to the distribution above about log(n@xmath6 )  =  21.5 .",
    "we plot a power law with @xmath62 index as the dot - dash line that provides a very good match to the measured distribution .",
    "perhaps fortuitously , this power law index corresponds to what would be expected for a population of resolved thin structures with some characteristic face - on column density when viewed at random orientations , as first noted by @xcite .",
    "this may well be a plausible interpretation for observations such as presented here which resolve the atomic `` skins '' of what are likely to be randomly oriented clouds of molecular hydrogen on 100  pc scales within galaxy disks .    of particular note",
    "is the magnitude of the statistical errors in our determination of @xmath4 .",

    "the detailed shape of the combined curve above log(n@xmath6 )  =  19.5 is also reproduced in detail by the three galaxies individually , despite the fact that they represent different hubble types and masses ; ranging from sb(s)m , to sa(s)cd to sa(s)b and spanning an uncorrected @xmath37  =  8.6  9.8 . from figure  13 of @xcite",
    "it is apparent that galaxies of these relatively late types contribute about 90% to the mass function in terms of both total mass and galaxy space density .",
    "the degree of inter - galaxy consistency is demonstrated with the error bars on the solid curve which represent rms differences of the distribution functions of the three individual galaxies with respect to the combined @xmath4 .",
    "what hasnt been included in these error bars is the systematic error due to the uncertainty in the normalisation for galaxy space density , @xmath63 ( and hence @xmath64 ) , of about 0.1 dex .",
    "errors in the normalisation would result in a vertical shift of the entire distribution function , but would not otherwise change the shape .",
    "we plot the parameterised fit to the distribution function of @xcite as the short - dashed curve in figs .",
    "[ fig : fnhc ] and [ fig : fnhcz ] . that curve is based on the analysis of a sample of 355 galaxy images in 21  cm emission made as part of the `` whisp '' project @xcite .",
    "the distribution of hubble types in the whisp sample @xcite is similar to that seen in the complete hipass @xcite sample , consisting of about 90% galaxies later than sb and 10% earlier .",
    "however , as noted at the outset of this section , it is limited by a median physical resolution of about 1.4  kpc and the inability to account for opacity effects .",
    "the authors suggest that their data might be representative in the range log(n@xmath6 )  =  19.8 to 21 , where sensitivity limits the low end and resolution limits the high end of that range",
    ". we plot the extrapolated extension of the fit beyond that range as a dotted line in the figure .",
    "@xcite have explored the consequences of smoothing of the whisp data to even coarser resolutions and note that this results in a steepening of the apparent @xmath4 for log(n@xmath6 )  =  20  21 .",
    "conversely , they expect that achieving higher physical resolution would lead to a flattening of the derived @xmath4 in that column density range , which would then more closely resemble what we observe .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio of median beam area between the whisp sample and ours is a factor of about 400 , implying that we sample about three times as many independent beam areas in our sample of only three galaxies as exist in the entire 355 galaxy whisp sample .",
    "we have attempted to reproduce the effects of coarse physical resolution by smoothing the uncorrected ( for opacity ) images of our three galaxies to the median beam size of the whisp sample , 1.4  kpc , and display these in figure  [ fig : nhw ] . as is clear from a comparsion of figures  [ fig : m31nhc][fig : lmcnhc ] with figure  [ fig : nhw ]",
    ", there is little useful information regarding the statistical ocurrence of intrinsic column densities at such a coarse physical resolution , given the extensive smearing of intrinsic peaks into larger areas of apparently lower column density .",
    "although the combined distribution function based on these three degraded images yields better agreement with the @xcite curve , it still does not agree in detail . looking at the @xmath4 contributions from the individual galaxies , it becomes apparent that the consequence of spatial smearing does not impact all galaxies to the same degree . while the redistribution of actual to apparent column densities has a moderate impact for the larger galactic systems , it becomes more dramatic for physically smaller ones . in the case of the lmc , the apparent area covered by log(n@xmath6 )  =  20  21 gas",
    "is increased by about a factor of two by this smoothing .",
    "its likely that this apparent enhancement of such column densities will be even more extreme in lower mass systems since they tend to have even smaller physical size . since low mass systems strongly dominate total galaxy numbers , they will similarly influence the distribution function of a galaxy sample via their relative weighting , @xmath65 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : fnhc ] .",
    "while we are not able to reproduce the @xcite results in detail , it seems likely that the discrepancies are consistent with insufficient physical resolution in the zwaan et al . study .",

    "since the primary observed difference between the z  =  0 and higher redshift distribution functions is limited to an increase in the surface area of intermediate column density gas , we have considered a toy model for the z  =  1 and z  =  3 images that simply retains the smallest radii in the m31 image shown in figure  [ fig : m31nhc ] , and replaces all structures at large projected radii ( greater than 25  kpc or 1.8 degree ) , with the apparent column density version of the same image that is first made fainter by a factor of three ( z  =  1 ) and five ( z  =  3 ) and scaled up in linear size by a factor of 1.55 ( z  =  1 ) and 2.3 ( z  =  3 ) .",
    "this could represent an extended intermediate column density halo around the high column density disk , that is larger in area than the actual z  =  0 galaxy by a factor of 2.4 for z  =  1 and 5.1 for z  =  3 .",

    "while this toy model is not physically motivated , it serves to demonstrate the types of structures needed to account for the enhanced contributions of intermediate column density gas in the high redshift data , and achieves these with only minimal changes to the z  =  0 images .",
    "such a distribution might arise if gas accretion rates from the intergalactic medium were substantially enhanced in the past .",
    "the recent simulations of @xcite suggest that the total gas accretion rate was enhanced by factors of about 3 and 10 at redshifts of 1 and 3 over that at z  =  0 , with the enhancement of `` cold mode '' accretion of mildly ionized , 10@xmath78  k gas , being even more dramatic at these redshifts .",
    "an alternative model , that is perhaps more plausible , might consist of a population of dwarf satellites surrounding each massive high redshift galaxy , the majority of which will merge with the parent by z  =  0 . since the spatial concentration of such a system will be similar to the halo model and the areal coverage of both high and intermediate column density gas will need to be identical ( to match the qso absorption line data ) there will likely be only minor practical differences between these two scenarios for the purpose of a statistical description .",
    "we have not attempted to pursue modeling of a merging satellite population at this time because of the many additional free parameters that would be introduced .",
    "a quantity that is often more useful in planning and interpreting surveys is the pathlength function , @xmath79 , the number of intervening systems per unit co - moving distance along any line - of - sight that exceed a particular column density .",
    "this is formed by integrating the positive tail of the distribution function and is shown in figure  [ fig : nnh ] .",

    "this is almost a factor of two lower than the value estimated by @xcite , @xmath81  =  0.045@xmath20.006 , and seems a consequence of the insufficient physical resolution ( a median of 1.4  kpc relative to a structure scale of 100  pc ) of that study .",
    "our measurement is compared with the values of @xmath82 published in the studies of @xcite and @xcite in the center panel of figure  [ fig : nnh ] .",
    "there has been a continuous decline in @xmath83 with redshift as noted by many previous authors .",
    "our redshift zero measurement demonstrates an ongoing decline since z  =  1 , rather than flattening to a constant value as suggested by the @xcite point .",
    "we include the @xmath82 values of our model for the z  =  1 ( @xmath84  =  0.042 ) and z  =  3 ( @xmath85  =  0.064 ) distributions on the plot to demonstrate the degree to which they are in agreement with the published data .",

    "we also plot the mass densities in our redshifted model distributions to demonstrate their consistency .",
    "the 21  cm transition offers great promise for documenting the evolution of neutral gas content with cosmic time . however , there are specific issues which need to be overcome before it can fulfill that promise . in the case of 21  cm emission ,",
    "the issue is sensitivity .",
    "even the deepest integrations with existing facilities have only been able to push back this frontier to z  @xmath87  0.2 for individual target detection @xcite . and",
    "while so - called `` stacking '' analysis @xcite can provide some statistical information on gas content at larger distances , the interpretation of such results can not be disentangled from the definition of the sample of objects to be co - added .",
    "reaching down to below m@xmath88 on individual targets at redshifts exceeding unity will require about 100 times the sensitivity that is currently available , which can only be achieved with a hundred - fold increase in collecting area such as planned for phase 2 of the international square kilometre array @xcite . for 21  cm line absorption , the major limitations are firstly , the need for a large instantaneous field - of - view which would enable effective blind surveys toward background continuum sources and secondly , an effective calibration of integrated absorber strength with the associated column density .",
    "the limitation of field - of - view is currently being addressed with phased array feed ( paf ) technology deployed on parabolic reflectors @xcite that will provide as much as 30  deg@xmath89 of instantaneous sky coverage .",
    "the limitation of 21  cm absorber calibration is one that we will attempt to address here .",
    "the necessity for calibration of the 21  cm absorption line strength is determined by the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of the 21  cm line opacity , which varies inversely with temperature , as already noted in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : tau ] as well as on possible nonthermal contributions to the linewidth .",
    "since any particular line - of - sight is likely to traverse more than one temperature of medium , there might be no simple correspondence of the 21  cm line opacity with the underlying column density .",
    "fortunately , there appears to be a particularly good one - to - one correspondence of these quantities observationally . @xcite",
    "have recently demonstrated the remarkably tight relationship between integrated 21  cm absorption opacity and the apparent ( ie .",
    "uncorrected for opacity ) column density determined from complimentary 21  cm emission observations of neighbouring lines - of - sight .",
    "we present a similar plot in figure  [ fig : nhatau ] where the galactic 21  cm absorption and emission data of @xcite are plotted as filled circles , together with similar data obtained toward m31 by @xcite as open circles and the lmc by @xcite as open squares . only the high signal - to - noise absorption detections ( exceeding 4@xmath16 ) are plotted .",
    "the curves in the figure represents the expectation for a `` sandwich '' geometry of cool gas with properties ( @xmath90 ) surrounded by layers of warm gas with properties ( @xmath91 ) as discussed in @xcite from , @xmath92 for a measured `` apparent '' column density , @xmath93 ( based on the integral of observed brightness temperature ) , a threshold column density ( where @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 , a saturation column density ( where @xmath96 ) , @xmath97 and an effective opacity , @xmath98 .",
    "the effective opacity is related to the measured integrated opacity by the effective linewidth , @xmath99 , as @xmath100 .",
    "the solid curve is for ( @xmath101  @xmath1 , @xmath102  @xmath1 , @xmath103  km / s ) while the dashed and dot - dash curves are for ( @xmath104  @xmath1 , @xmath105  @xmath1 , @xmath106  km / s ) and ( @xmath107  @xmath1 , @xmath108  @xmath1 , @xmath109  km / s ) , respectively .",
    "the `` sandwich '' geometry is meant to represent the role of a `` temperature - shielding '' column density of the warm neutral medium ( wnm ) that absorbs local euv and x - ray radiation and is a requirement for condensation of the cool neutral medium ( cnm ) within ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it should be noted that this `` temperature - shielding '' column is quite distinct from the `` self - shielding '' column density of only a few times @xmath110  @xmath1   that marks the onset of recombination of hydrogen within an ionizing radiation field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "once neutral columns of about @xmath111  @xmath1  are achieved , the expectation is that the ionization fraction will be minimal , even in extreme radiation fields .",
    "such a model provides a very good characterisation of the observable properties of the absorbing medium in the galaxy , where it is best constrained by data , but also of the available extragalactic data from m31 and the lmc , in which both higher and lower metallicity and radiation field environments are probed .",
    "the dashed and dot - dash curves provide a reasonable estimate of the scatter observed in this relationship . since the curves drawn in figure  [ fig : nhatau ] are based on a physical model , we can also write the corresponding equation for the _ actual rather than the apparent _ column density , @xmath112 the curves based on the same parameters as previously are drawn in the right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : nhatau ] . while these are unchanged at low column density , they do not exhibit the saturation effect at high columns that afflict observations of 21  cm emission .          with the column density calibration of 21  cm absorption line strength of the previous sub - section in hand it becomes possible to construct the distribution function of 21  cm opacity .",
    "[ eqn : nh ] was used to transform the three images of opacity - corrected column density ( figs .",
    "[ fig : m31nhc][fig : lmcnhc ] ) to corresponding images of 21  cm absorption line strength .",
    "the transformation was done using the nominal transformation depicted in figure  [ fig : nhatau ] with parameters ( @xmath113  @xmath1 , @xmath114  @xmath1 , @xmath103  km / s ) as well as the two envelope curves with ( @xmath104  @xmath1 , @xmath115  @xmath1 , @xmath106  km / s ) and ( @xmath116  @xmath1 , @xmath108  @xmath1 , @xmath117  km / s ) in order to track the intrinsic scatter and uncertainty .",
    "the distribution function was then calculated from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : fnhc ] but with @xmath118 in the place of @xmath119 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : ftau ] with the solid curve illustrating the nominal z  =  0 relation , while the dashed and dot - dashed curves span the scatter and uncertainty .",
    "what is notable is the flatness of the distribution below about @xmath120  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the `` temperature - shielding '' threshold implies that there will be essentially no additional systems seen with an intrinsic absorption depth below this value .",
    "distribution functions of the 21  cm absorption for the toy models developed above to describe the z  =  1 and 3 qso data are also plotted in figure  [ fig : ftau ] as the dotted and short - dashed curves utilizing the nominal z  =  0 transformation .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in the applicability of the z  =  0 relation at these higher redshifts .",
    "the intergalactic ionizing radiation field is expected to increase dramatically with redshift in concert with the evolution of the massive star formation rate and active galaxy incidence .",
    "while this will have a major influence on the `` self - shielding '' column density ( of a few times @xmath110  @xmath1 ) for the onset of the ionized to neutral transition at the galaxy - igm interface , it is less clear what the impact might be on the `` temperature - shielding '' column ( of @xmath121  @xmath1 ) for the warm to cool transition that occurs deep within individual galaxy disks .",
    "this is because the radiation field in this latter case is strongly dominated by local contributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that the intrinsic scatter of the z  =  0 relation in figure  [ fig : nhatau ] is already a consequence of the large variations in local radiation field intensity that naturally occur within individual galaxies .",
    "future work will be vital to test this hypothesis in more extreme environments , such as the disks of nearby star - bursting galaxies .",
    "we will continue with our discussion of possible evolutionary trends of absorption properties with this caveat in mind .",
    "since deep 21  cm absorption features , @xmath122  km  s@xmath10 , require high column density , @xmath123  @xmath1 , lines - of - sight and the incidence of such column densities does not appear to evolve significantly with redshift ( figure  [ fig : fnhcz ] ) , there is also no evolution in the distribution function of 21  cm absorption in figure  [ fig : ftau ] for such deep features .",
    "redshift evolution is confined to the relatively weak 21  cm absorbers with strength @xmath124  km  s@xmath10   that correspond to @xmath125  @xmath1 .              just as was done above for the column density",
    ", it is possible to calculate the corresponding pathlength function , @xmath79 , the number of 21  cm absorption systems per unit distance that exceed a particular absorption depth , @xmath118 .",
    "this is formed by integrating the positive tail of the 21  cm absorption distribution function and is shown in figure  [ fig : ntau ] with the same curves used previously to depict the z  =  0 , 1 and 3 predictions .",
    "the same trends noted previously for the distribution function apply here as well , namely an absence of redshift evolution for deep absorbers and number evolution by a factor of several for the faint absorbers .",
    "the preceeding discussion has assumed that the background source used to probe intervening absorbers has a small angular size relative to the most compact structures within the absorbing system .",
    "what if this is not the case ? since we already have images that represent absorption depth , it is straightforward to simulate the observable effect of an arbitrary background source size and structure .",
    "this can be done by evaluating the convolution of the absorption depth image with an image of the background source , normalized to preserve the integrated absorption depth .",
    "the distribution function of such convolved images can then be calculated in the same way .",
    "this has been done in the right hand panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : ftau ] and [ fig : ntau ] for an assumed gaussian background source of 9  kpc fwhm .",
    "this choice of background source model is motivated by the 1.3 arcsec median source size observed for mjy brightness radio sources at ghz frequencies @xcite which subtend more than 9  kpc for all redshifts greater than about 0.7 .",
    "this should be regarded as a `` worst case scenario '' from the standpoint of absorption signal dilution , since there is some probability that a compact component may be present , even in an intrinsically extended background source .",
    "the impact of a significantly extended background source on the 21  cm absorber distribution and pathlength functions is dramatic .",
    "as can be seen in the right hand panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : ftau ] and [ fig : ntau ] , deep absorption systems will not be observed at all in this instance , while an enhanced number of apparently faint absorbers are seen instead .",
    "this redistribution of intrinsically deep into apparently faint absorbers also has as a consequence that there is no predicted observable evolution at all in the 21  cm absorption properties with redshift .",
    "as noted above , this assessment must be regarded as a `` worst case scenario '' since the median source size has been distributed smoothly in our simulation .",
    "better insights into the typical structures seen in radio sources at ghz frequencies are provided by the recent study of @xcite who studied a sample of nearly 100 moderate brightness radio sources with angular resolution of about 20  mas .",
    "overall , some 20% of these sources were found to have a substantial ( 50  100% ) flux contribution from unresolved structures . however , when considering sources fainter than 1  mjy at 1.4  ghz , this fraction declined to only 7% .    what the dramatic contrast between the left- and right - hand panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : ftau ] and [ fig : ntau ] underlines is the importance of isolating the flux contribution of suitably compact structures , subtending less than about 100  pc at the distance of the absorption system , in interpreting any measurement of 21  cm absorption .",
    "interpretation is essentially impossible without this information .",
    "the implication for large surveys of 21  cm absorption at redshifts z  @xmath7  0.5 is that high resolution imaging , with about 15  mas beam size , will be needed for the useful interpretation of any detections , either during the survey itself or as follow - up . at the relevant observing frequencies ,",
    "@xmath126  @xmath5  700  mhz , this implies a need for baselines greater than about 5500  km .",
    "the analysis of high resolution and sensitivity datacubes of local group galaxies has permitted some fundamental conclusions to be drawn :    1 .",
    "galaxy disks contain a significant population of features which are self - opaque in the 21  cm transition .",
    "such features are intrinsically compact , with narrow dimensions that are typically only about 100  pc , which determines the resolution required for their study .",
    "such features can locally disguise the presence of high atomic column densities in the range @xmath127 , that are not apparent in images of the integrated 21  cm linestrength .",
    "globally , such features account for about 34@xmath25% more atomic gas than is derived under the assumption of negligible self - opacity .",
    "application of this opacity correction to recent estimates of the cosmological mass density of within local galaxies yields , @xmath38  =  5.6@xmath39 assuming that our limited galaxy sample provides a representative determination .",
    "the resolved , opacity corrected images of local group galaxies permit calculation of a robust redshift zero distribution function , @xmath4 , with excellent statistical properties ( based on 1000 s of independent sight - lines ) and a high degree of internal consistency amongst galaxy types between sb and sm . while similar to high redshift determinations , there is evidence for a systematic decline in intermediate column density gas , @xmath128 , that can be well modelled by a decrease in the surface area of galaxy halos ( or associated satellites ) by a factor of about 2.5 since z  =  1 and a factor of about 5 since z  =  3 .",
    "the number of equivalent damped lyman alpha ( dla ) absorbers per unit comoving length , @xmath81  =  0.026@xmath20.003 , is significantly lower than seen at higher redshifts by factors as large as about four and follows a smoothly declining trend .",
    "similarly , the cosmological mass density in dlas , @xmath86  =  5.4@xmath39 , follows a smoothly declining trend , albeit one that sees only a factor of two decline between redshift 4 and the present .",
    "there is a tight , non - linear correlation between the observed 21  cm absorption opacity and the integrated 21  cm emission brightness from adjacent sight - lines through nearby galaxy disks which permits `` calibration '' of our column density images into corresponding ones of integrated 21  cm opacity .",
    "we present predictions for the distribution and pathlength functions of 21  cm integrated opacity at both redshift zero and at high redshift for the case of no evolution in the local opacity calibration .",
    "the prediction is that faint 21  cm absorbers , @xmath129  km  s@xmath10 , have declined by a factor of about 2.5 since z  =  1 and a factor of about 5 since z  =  3 , while the number of deep absorbers , @xmath130  km  s@xmath10 , has not evolved .",
    "we explore the impact of a finite background source size on the distribution and pathlength functions of 21  cm integrated opacity .",
    "adoption of the observed 1.3 arcsec median source size of mjy radio sources dramatically changes the apparent opacity distributions and effectively precludes any physical interpretation of the measurements .",
    "future surveys of 21  cm absorption will require a 15 mas beamsize for their unambiguous interpretation .",

    "<S> , the incidence of deep 21  cm absorption systems is predicted to show very little evolution with redshift , while that of faint absorbers should decline by a factor of five between z  =  3 and the present . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly consider the effects of absorption against background sources that are extended relative to the 100  pc intervening absorber size scale . </S>",
    "<S> extended background sources result in dramatically altered distribution and pathlength functions which are insensitive to the predicted redshift evolution . </S>",
