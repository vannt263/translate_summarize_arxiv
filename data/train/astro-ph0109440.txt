    "theoretical work by beuermann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , baraffe , and kolb ( 2000 ) , and howell et al . (",
    "2001 ) and references therein have developed detailed models which provide mass estimates for cv secondaries as a function of orbital period .",
    "all of these works are in fair agreement and propose that most secondary stars in systems with short orbital periods ( @xmath3 5.5 hr ) are more or less the most  normal \" secondary stars in any cv .",
    "additionally , these authors conclude that as a cv evolves towards the top of the period gap , the secondary will become bloated , as it is not in thermal equilibrium , and attain a larger radius for its mass compared with a main sequence counterpart .",
    "details of the expected observational properties of these bloated secondaries can be found in howell ( 2001 ) .",
    "observational work by a number of authors has been compiled by smith and dhillon ( 1998 ) and from that work we find that there are only 16 cvs with orbital periods under 5.5 hr which have reliable mass estimates ( i.e. , with well determined uncertainties ) for the secondary star .    using the theoretical work of howell et al .",
    "( 2001 ) as an example for the evolution of cvs , in particular the evolution and properties of the secondary stars , we plot their expected relation for m@xmath0 as a function of orbital period ( dashed line ) in figure 1 .",
    "also included ( solid line ) is the relation expected for main sequence stars of radius equal to the roche lobe radius at a given orbital period .",
    "over - plotted in figure 1 are the sixteen reliable m@xmath0 masses from smith and dhillon .",
    "we can easily see from figure 1 that at present , the observational data can not in general confirm or deny whether the theoretical models are correct .",
    "only five of the masses have sufficiently small uncertainties to be useful , and of those , the two above the period gap seem to favor the theoretical model while below the gap the three well determined values fall below both relations . what is needed to help solve this issue are more , accurate determinations of the masses of the secondary stars in cvs .",
    "these are likely to come about through the use of high s / n ir spectroscopy obtained with large ( @xmath44 m ) telescopes ."
