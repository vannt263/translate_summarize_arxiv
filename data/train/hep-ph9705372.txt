    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite has long been used as a starting point for the description of light mesonic states as fermion - antifermion composites .",
    "it shares several features with qcd , notably a dynamically - broken chiral symmetry , with the pions as approximate goldstone bosons .",
    "the model is based on fermionic fields interacting through a local , chirally - invariant , four - point vertex .",
    "the local nature of the interaction produces a great simplification of the schwinger  dyson and bethe  salpeter equations .",
    "the main drawbacks of the model are , however , direct consequences of this locality .",
    "specifically , they are that the loop integrals diverge ( and so must somehow be regulated ) and that the model is non - confining .",
    "although the njl model does contain regularization - independent information@xcite and the results with various regularization schemes have been found to be qualitatively similar@xcite , the choice of any particular scheme lacks a sound physical motivation .",
    "a feature of many regularization schemes is that as well as the form of the cut - off , a particular momentum routing must be specified for loop diagrams with two - or - more quark lines@xcite . in practice a symmetric routing",
    "is often implicitly taken in order to maintain ward identities .",
    "the regularization scheme must be specified yet further if one wishes to calculate beyond leading order in the @xmath2 expansion , a new cut - off being required for meson loops@xcite .",
    "another unsatisfactory aspect is that if low - energy theorems for anomalous processes ( for example @xmath3 ) are to hold then the anomalous diagrams must either be left unregulated@xcite or else additional terms must be added to the lagrangian in order to respect the anomalous ward identities@xcite .",
    "related problems occur in the presence of vector interactions@xcite if one attempts to apply the regularization prescription to both the anomalous and non - anomalous sectors .",
    "many attempts have been made to generalize the original njl model@xcite to remove such unwanted features whilst retaining its successful phenomenological aspects@xcite .",
    "one promising approach , which provides some motivation for the model studied here , is suggested by instanton - liquid studies@xcite . in that picture , the instantons induce an effective four - quark vertex , which is nonlocal but of a separable form .",
    "the separable nature of the interaction retains as far as possible the simplifying features of a local model , with the nonlocality providing a cut - off on all loop integrals .",
    "a similar class of model has a separable dependence on the relative momentum of the @xmath4 pair and has been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "other models with simple interactions have been suggested based on various types of gluonic field configurations within the qcd vacuum .",
    "for example , efimov and coworkers@xcite start with a constant ( anti- ) self - dual background field in euclidean space and base their four - quark vertex on one - gluon exchange within such a background .",
    "yet another recent model@xcite used a four - quark vertex mediated by a random colour - matrix , as an attempt to simulate a strongly - fluctuating background gluon field ( see also@xcite ) .",
    "we should mention that there are also studies of qcd schwinger ",
    "dyson equations based on one - gluon exchange forces between the quarks , often using effective gluon propagators@xcite ( also see@xcite and references therein ) .    here",
    "we develop further the model proposed in ref .",
    "this is based on a nonlocal , separable , four - quark vertex .",
    "it is therefore similar to the instanton - liquid model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the differences being that more general choices of the form factor and possible couplings are considered .",
    "the particular choice of form factor used in this model can lead to quark confinement , in the sense of a quark propagator without poles at real energies .",
    "it also ensures convergence of the quark - loop integrals , unlike that chosen in the separable model of ref .",
    "@xcite . only the pions and their scalar partner were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the spirit of the extended njl model  @xcite",
    ", we incorporate other mesonic degrees of freedom , such as the vector mesons .",
    "including these particles enables us to probe the role of the confinement mechanism , since they have masses of around twice a typical constituent - quark mass . in a model without confinement , and with an otherwise reasonable constituent - quark mass of @xmath5 mev , the @xmath6 meson would lie above the @xmath4 threshold and could decay into free @xmath4 states .    as well as the meson spectrum",
    ", we calculate hadronic decays of these particles and some electromagnetic processes , including @xmath7 and the pion form factor .",
    "with regard to the electromagnetic processes , we also examine whether there is any support for the concept of vector - meson dominance within a model of this type .    in our present calculations ,",
    "we work at leading - order in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "our results are thus comparable to those of most njl - model and schwinger - dyson approaches . at next - to - leading order",
    ", one has to include fock terms arising from the four - point interaction and meson - loop contributions .",
    "calculations at this order in the njl model@xcite indicate that such corrections can be significant , especially in the scalar - isoscalar channel .",
    "this may explain some of the failures of the model to give a good description of amplitudes involving this channel .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s2 ] we define the extended model and give the forms of the corresponding vector and axial currents . in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we present the forms of the quark and meson propagators and describe the means of coupling to external currents .",
    "the determination of the model parameters is described in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] , and results for hadronic and electromagnetic decays of mesons are presented in secs .",
    "[ s5 ] and [ s6 ] respectively .",
    "formally at least , one can imagine integrating out gluonic degrees of freedom to leave an effective action for qcd expressed in terms of quark fields only . as in the usual njl model",
    ", we keep only two - body forces between the quarks , described by four - quark interaction vertices .",
    "indeed , at leading order in @xmath2 , all six - quark and higher interactions could be absorbed into effective couplings for the four - quark terms , by replacing extra @xmath8 factors with their vacuum expectation values .",
    "this is just the procedure followed in the three - flavour extended njl model@xcite with a six - quark , u(1)@xmath9-breaking t hooft determinant@xcite . in the present work , however , we specialize to two - flavours with isospin symmetry .",
    "the action may be written as @xmath10    imposing su(2)@xmath11su(2)@xmath12u(1)@xmath13 symmetry requires that certain of the possible dirac and isospin structures appear in the combinations : @xmath14 whilst the strengths of the following interactions are unconstrained by symmetry considerations : @xmath15    a variety of models of the above type can be found in the literature , differing in the ansatz chosen for @xmath16 .",
    "the original njl model , for instance , has @xmath17 and a constant coupling strength , whereas one - gluon exchange models take @xmath18 .",
    "our own approach is motivated in part by the instanton - liquid model@xcite .",
    "within the zero - mode approximation to that picture , there is a 2@xmath19-quark interaction , which is of separable form , @xmath20 in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite the function @xmath21 is of a particular form and for two flavours of quarks the relation @xmath22 follows from the form of the t hooft determinant@xcite .",
    "an interaction of tensor character is also present but is @xmath2 suppressed .",
    "the model studied here is similar to that of dyakonov and petrov@xcite , in that it is based on an interaction with the separable form ( [ separable ] ) .",
    "however , we shall adopt a more phenomenological attitude towards the form - factor @xmath21 and the allowed couplings .",
    "only interactions in the colour - singlet channels are considered in the present study . the @xmath23 coupling ( in the ladder approximation )",
    "produces the pions and their isoscalar scalar partner , @xmath24 .",
    "the couplings in the spin-1 channels @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are responsible for the @xmath6 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 mesons .",
    "the @xmath31 coupling allows the model to describe an isovector scalar and an isoscalar pseudoscalar meson .",
    "the lowest - lying meson with quantum numbers corresponding to the former is @xmath32 , whilst the latter is a non - strange state with the quantum numbers of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which we shall refer to as @xmath35 .",
    "we shall not consider the possible tensor interactions , described by the coupling @xmath36 .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , these can contribute in the vector channels , where they give rise to anomalous magnetic - moment couplings of the vector mesons to constituent quarks . in the absence of any strong phenomenological need for such couplings we choose not to include them .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , all of the possible independent interactions ( [ chiral relations],[indep interact ] ) are assumed to contain the same form factor and to differ only in the constant coupling strengths , @xmath37 . as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we take the form factor to be gaussian in euclidean space : @xmath38 this choice was shown to be able to give quark confinement .",
    "we have in fact examined the possibility of taking a different @xmath39 for each of the independent couplings .",
    "since this does not lead to any very significant effects , the results are not presented here .",
    "this is because the main features are dominated by the form of the quark self - energy which , in the ladder approximation , depends only on the @xmath23 interaction .",
    "the usual , local expressions for the vector and axial currents do not satisfy the correct continuity equations when one uses the equations of motion derived from the action ( [ 4q action][separable ] ) . in order to obtain symmetry currents with the same divergences as the corresponding local currents in qcd , and hence to maintain the corresponding ward identities ,",
    "one has to introduce additional nonlocal terms in the currents .",
    "a noether - like method of construction for these nonlocal pieces was developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a part of that procedure",
    "the following identity was used , @xmath40 @xmath41 being some arbitrary path from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "the divergence requirement determines the longitudinal component of a current which is , therefore , a path - independent object . in",
    "ref.@xcite the choice of path was irrelevant since the authors were interested only in the longitudinal component of the axial current , in order to determine the pion decay constant .",
    "the transverse part of the current , however , is sensitive to the particular choice of @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , ambiguity in the transverse current is a feature of any method used to construct a ( partially ) conserved current corresponding to a nonlocal action .",
    "when one wishes to consider electromagnetic processes , as in the present work , it is necessary to assume some form for the transverse current .",
    "this assumption forms an additional part of the specification of the model . in our present calculations ,",
    "we adopt the straight line ansatz@xcite , @xmath44 since this choice respects both lorentz and translational invariance .",
    "in fact a number of the electromagnetic observables calculated in sec.[s6 ] are dominated by the local piece of the vector current and so should not be very sensitive to the choice of path .",
    "the nonlocal interactions in the model defined by ( [ 4q action][separable ] ) give rise to various nonlocal terms in the currents , whose momentum - space forms are presented below .",
    "( note that where momentum derivatives with respect to @xmath45 occur , then the combination @xmath46 is understood to be held fixed . ) for the isoscalar vector current , the nonlocal pieces all have the structure , @xmath47 which we refer to as type i. the sum over @xmath48 in ( [ i ] ) runs over the same combinations of couplings and dirac and isospin matrices as those found in the action , ( [ chiral relations],[indep interact ] ) .",
    "the isovector vector current also has nonlocal contributions of this type - i structure ( [ i ] ) . in this case",
    "the isospin and dirac matrices appear in the combinations : @xmath49 another type of nonlocal structure also arises in this current , @xmath50 .",

    "the dirac matrices appear in the combinations : @xmath51    turning to the isovector axial current , the type - i terms are again present .",
    "these involve the matrix combinations : @xmath52 there are no type - ii pieces in this current , but a third kind of nonlocal structure does occur , @xmath53 .",
    "\\label{iii}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the relevant terms in this case are : @xmath54    it is straightforward to see that dependence on the path , @xmath55 , does not appear in the longitudinal components of the currents . since the form factor depends only on the square of its argument , one has in the case of type - i contributions @xmath56 the @xmath55 integral in @xmath57 is then trivial , and produces a difference in form factors .",
    "similar results can be seen to hold for the longitudinal components of the other nonlocal structures  ( [ ii],[iii ] ) .",
    "useful checks on the above expressions for the currents are provided by various ward identities which follow from ( partial ) current conservation@xcite . in the case of the axial current ,",
    "an extension of the arguments in ref.@xcite can be used to show that the gell - mann  oakes  renner ( gmor ) relation@xcite holds . for the vector currents ,",
    "we have checked that the two - point correlator of vector currents is purely transverse , that the @xmath58 ward identity is satisfied , that the pion charge is unity , and that the low - energy theorem for the anomalous decay @xmath3 is satisfied .",
    "the first step in the calculations is to construct the dressed quark propagator , by means of the corresponding schwinger  dyson equation ( sde ) .",
    "we treat it in the ladder approximation , which is equivalent to working at leading order in the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "1 gives an illustration of the diagrams that are summed in this approximation . in terms of a momentum - dependent quark  mass \"",
    "@xmath59 defined from the dressed quark propagator by @xmath60 this equation can be written as @xmath61 the dressing at this order occurs only through the interaction in the isoscalar scalar channel , @xmath23 .",
    "the integral here is very similar to that appearing in the quark condensate , apart from the extra interaction form factors . just as in the original njl model , the dynamical generation of quark masses",
    "is intimately connected with the appearance of a non - zero condensate . in our numerical treatment of the model we evaluate loop integrals like that in ( [ sde ladder ] ) in euclidean space , since the form factor has been defined for euclidean momenta .",
    "physical results are then obtained by analytically continuing back to minkowski space . notice that the separable nature of the interaction produces a great simplification since the dependence on the external momentum @xmath62 factorizes out of the loop integral .",
    "the solution to the sde ( [ sde ladder ] ) can be written simply as @xmath63 hence to obtain the quark mass it is necessary to determine only the constant @xmath64 .",
    "this can be done easily using iterative methods .",
    "in practice we choose to use equation  ( [ sde ladder ] ) to determine the parameter @xmath23 for a given value of @xmath65 , the zero - momentum quark mass in the chiral limit .",
    "the denominator of the quark propagator , @xmath66 , does not have a zero at positive ( minkowski ) @xmath67 if @xmath64 is sufficiently large .",
    "this property provides a sufficient , although not strictly a necessary , condition for confinement .",
    "there are still poles in the quark propagator , but they are shifted into the complex @xmath67 plane .",
    "such behaviour is not uncommon in models of quark confinement based on the solution of a schwinger ",
    "dyson equation  @xcite in the ladder approximation .",
    "because of the simplifications due to the separable interaction , the present model provides a convenient setting in which to investigate this mechanism for confinement .",
    "as pointed out by lee and wick  @xcite ( see also@xcite ) , particles which have a complex mass of this type should not appear as asymptotic states if one is to have a unitary s - matrix .",
    "when amplitudes have been defined in euclidean space , the prescription for analytically continuing them back to minkowski space must respect this requirement , as described in more detail in subsec .",
    "[ loopint ] .      the meson masses and vertex functions",
    "are found using the bethe  salpeter equation ( bse ) .",
    "for consistency with the sde ( [ sde ladder ] ) , we work in the ladder approximation . at this level ,",
    "the separable interaction allows the @xmath4 scattering matrix , @xmath68 , to be written in the form @xmath69 where we have denoted the total momentum of the @xmath4 pair by @xmath70 .",
    "the bse , shown schematically in fig .  2 ,",
    "may be conveniently expressed in terms of @xmath71 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is simply a matrix of the coupling constants from the action ( [ 4q action][separable ] ) and @xmath74 is composed of the loop integrals @xmath75 where we have introduced @xmath76 .",
    "the quark propagators to be used in  ( [ j ] ) are the dressed propagators obtained by solving the ladder sde .",
    "the mesonic bound states are located at the poles of @xmath71 .",
    "these can be determined from the equation @xmath77    the form of the action means that the matrix @xmath73 is diagonal with respect to flavour and lorentz structures .",
    "the scattering matrix , however , is only block - diagonal , since certain off - diagonal elements of @xmath78 may be non - zero . in particular",
    "there is a loop integral that leads to mixing between the pseudoscalar and longitudinal axial channels .",
    "this @xmath79 ( and @xmath80 ) mixing is an example of the  partial higgs mechanism \" familiar from effective lagrangians of @xmath81 and @xmath28 mesons@xcite .",
    "it leads to an axial as well as a pseudoscalar vertex function for the pion and @xmath35 . with each flavour having an equal current quark mass ,",
    "no such mixing occurs between the scalar and vector channels , as can be seen from the fact that the integrand in the corresponding element of ( [ j ] ) is odd under @xmath82 .",
    "the absence of such a mixing means that the longitudinal vector channel is quite independent of the scalar one .",
    "it is therefore important to check that a pole does not develop in the former channel , since that would be unphysical .    for later ease of reference",

    "the vertex functions for the final and initial states are related by @xmath89 . for the particles of interest",
    ", they are : @xmath90 for all particles except the pseudoscalars there is no mixing , and so each has a single coupling constant @xmath91 describing the coupling of an on - shell meson to quarks .",

    "the loop integrals in the bse ( [ j ] ) take the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the appropriate dirac trace and all momenta are to be understood as euclidean .",
    "we have introduced @xmath102 here to denote the quark mass evaluated at @xmath103 .",
    "consider this integral evaluated at some timelike momentum , @xmath104 .",
    "for a confining parameter set , each quark propagator considered as a function of energy has four poles at complex energies corresponding to a pair of complex - conjugate poles in @xmath67 . as @xmath105",
    "is increased these poles are translated parallel to the imaginary @xmath106 axis . for any given value of @xmath107 , there is value of @xmath105 for which the poles of the @xmath108 and @xmath109 quark propagators meet on the real @xmath106 axis , pinching the contour of integration . for larger values of @xmath105",
    "the poles cross the axis and may contribute an imaginary part to the propagator in the meson channel , depending on the prescription used to continue the integral beyond the pinch point .    the usual prescription based on wick rotation of the integration contour would lead to an imaginary part of the meson propagator starting at the minimum value of @xmath105 for which the contour is pinched .",
    "this would correspond to the opening of a threshold for decay of a meson into other states , and as described above ( subsec .",
    "[ quark ] ) is inappropriate here .    one possible continuation , originally suggested by cutkosky et al .",
    "@xcite , amounts to the deformation of the integration contour displayed in fig .",
    "this prescription ensures that the resulting meson propagator does not develop an imaginary part above the pseudo - threshold where the contour is pinched by the complex poles , although it does mean that the propagator can not be analytically continued past that point . since the method is not unique , the choice of continuation prescription must be regarded as an additional assumption that forms part of the specification of any model with a quark propagator of this type . in our calculations",
    "we shall adopt the suggestion of cutkosky et al .",
    ", which was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to be consistent with the requirements of unitarity and macrocausality .    as discussed by both cutkosky et al .",

    "however , in order to measure such violations , lee and wick  @xcite have estimated that one would need to create a wave packet of width @xmath110 , where the complex mass is @xmath111 . in any event , microcausality in the model",
    "is intrinsically broken by the use of an action with nonlocal interactions .    in evaluating these integrals numerically ,",
    "we take a contour in @xmath106 that runs along the real axis . for energies",

    ", we therefore need to regulate the two contributions when evaluating them separately .",
    "we subtract off a function which has the same divergence as the naive integral when @xmath62 lies within a radius @xmath112 of the pinch point .",
    "a similar function is used to cancel the divergent part of the residue contribution when @xmath107 is less than @xmath112 from its pinch value and is chosen to cancel exactly with the piece that has been cut out of the naive integral .",

    "this expression gives values for @xmath170 of 143.6 mev for set a and 143.2 mev for set b. comparing these results with those of the full calculations for these parameter sets , we see that higher - order terms in the chiral expansion contribute about 10% to @xmath116 .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding contributions to @xmath170 are less than 3% .",
    "these observations suggest that the restoring forces against deviations from the chiral circle are rather weak in this model . one would therefore expect to find a light",

    "if it is regulated by subtracting the perturbative condensate , slightly higher values of @xmath174 and @xmath175 are obtained .",
    "these are similar in size to values for the condensate determined from qcd sum rules@xcite .",

    "table  2 lists the positions of the first few sets of poles in the quark propagator .",

    "the scalar isoscalar state is rather light . for comparison ,",
    "the mass of the corresponding particle in the njl model@xcite is @xmath178 , where @xmath179 is the mass of the constituent quark .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath24 mass in our model varies only slowly with the dynamical quark mass .",
    "the empirical determination of the mass of the corresponding scalar isoscalar meson is still unclear because of the very strong coupling between that meson and the two - pion channel .",
    "while some analyses find masses of the order of 1 gev@xcite , others result in much smaller values@xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 masses obtained in this model , like those in the njl model , are compatible with the latter . however , before taking them too seriously , one should remember that the strong coupling to two pions also means that @xmath2 corrections are likely to be important in this channel@xcite .",
    "it is thus premature to draw conclusions about the ability of the model to describe this channel until such corrections have been calculated .",
    "the calculated @xmath28 mass is somewhat smaller than the observed 1230 mev@xcite . in the case of parameter",
    "set a , it lies a little below the pseudo - threshold , but for most of the range of admissible @xmath65 it is above that energy . the @xmath180 mass splitting increases with increasing constituent quark mass , although not so rapidly as suggested by the njl@xcite expression , @xmath181 , obtained from the derivative expansion of the bosonized model . as a consequence of the upper bound on the constituent mass , which follows from the effect of the pseudo - threshold on the transverse - vector channel , it is not possible to simultaneously reproduce the empirical values for both the @xmath6 and @xmath28 masses in the ladder approximation .",
    "since there are important flavour - mixing effects in the isoscalar pseudoscalar sector , a realistic calculation for these mesons would require a three - flavour version of the model .",
    "the @xmath35 mass in the present two - flavour model should not therefore be directly compared with experiment .",
    "it is nevertheless reassuring that this mass lies between the physical @xmath33 and @xmath34 masses of @xmath182 and @xmath183 mev respectively .",
    "another possibly important feature in the description of the state is the axial - pseudoscalar mixing with the longitudinal @xmath30 channel .",
    "indeed , in a bethe - salpeter study of a three - flavour model@xcite , the @xmath184 term in the vertex function was found to make significant contributions to the mass ( @xmath185 mev ) and decay constant of the @xmath33 .",
    "a similar effect has also been found in the njl model@xcite . in the present model ,",
    "if the @xmath30 is omitted by setting @xmath27 to zero , then the @xmath35 mass for parameter set a is reduced by around @xmath186 mev , whereas for set b it falls by over @xmath187 mev .",
    "these rather different behaviours are another consequence of the dramatic changes in the meson propagators which can occur at the pseudo - threshold . when @xmath188 , the @xmath35 mass lies below the pseudo - threshold for the full range of parameter sets . for non - zero @xmath27 ,",
    "the mixing increases the @xmath35 mass and for parameter sets with @xmath189 mev the mass is pushed above the pseudo - threshold , where the effect can be greatly enhanced .",
    "in addition , for these parameter sets the gradient of the determinant @xmath190 ( cf .",
    "( [ piondet ] ) ) changes significantly above the pseudo - threshold and so the coupling of the @xmath35 to quarks is considerably stronger .",
    "at leading order in @xmath2 , the three - meson vertices are calculated from a quark loop with insertions of three vertex functions . we have obtained several physical decay amplitudes from such diagrams with all of the mesons on - shell , where the vertex functions are unambiguous .    for an initial state of momentum",
    "@xmath124 decaying to particles with momenta @xmath191 and @xmath192 , the quark propagators in the triangular loop are evaluated at @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "if the initial state has a mass which is greater than twice the real part of the quark pole , then its decay modes will be sensitive to pseudo - threshold effects . by analogy with the loop integral in the bse for that particle",
    ", residue contributions must be taken into account in the three - point diagrams .",
    "it is also possible that further residue contributions may be required if a final - state particle lies above the pseudo - threshold energy , but such a situation does not occur in practice for any of the amplitudes considered .",

    "@xmath195    if the sigma meson of the model is to be interpreted as corresponding to the scalar particle of the linear sigma model then its coupling to two pions should be strong .",
    "whilst the values in table  4 do not indicate a particularly broad state , this width is significantly reduced by the small available phase space . to provide a useful comparison , we consider the prediction for the two - pion coupling @xmath196 from the linear sigma model . in that model",
    "the coupling is @xmath197 which , for the @xmath24 masses of parameter sets a and b gives @xmath198 mev and @xmath199 mev respectively .",
    "these values are @xmath200 larger than the results for our model , indicating that the coupling to pions of the scalar meson in the nonlocal njl model is qualitatively similar to that in the linear - sigma - model .",
    "as already mentioned , this strong coupling indicates the importance of going beyond leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath6 meson decay width compares reasonably well with the empirical value of @xmath201 mev .",
    "in contrast , the corresponding leading - order calculation in an extended njl model , using the physical @xmath6 mass , significantly underestimates the decay rate@xcite .",
    "we find that it is not possible to simultaneously reproduce the empirical mass and decay width of the @xmath6 at leading order in our model .",
    "however , if the model parameters for a given @xmath65 are refitted to the @xmath6 width rather than to its mass , the results for observables are not qualitatively different from those of the original fit .",
    "for instance , this procedure would increase the @xmath6 mass itself by @xmath202 to @xmath203 mev .",
    "the coupling @xmath204 is not a direct observable , although the process it describes would be involved in the physical decay of @xmath205 .",
    "the partial widths for @xmath206 found in this model are similar to those in other extended chiral models@xcite . in contrast , the particle data group  @xcite quotes an experimental upper bound on the final state @xmath207 of @xmath208 of the total @xmath28 width of @xmath209 mev .",
    "the strong couplings obtained here suggest that the model may not be consistent with such a result . however , the situation is far from clear .",
    "the two - stage process @xmath210 would have to be integrated over the momentum of the intermediate scalar meson . for momenta corresponding to a virtual @xmath24 , the @xmath211 and @xmath212 couplings may be reduced from their on - shell values . a hint that this may indeed be the case",
    "is provided by the @xmath212 loop integral , which vanishes at a total energy of around @xmath213 mev .",
    "furthermore , there is also an amplitude for the @xmath214 final state originating from a direct , four - point @xmath215 diagram which we have not yet calculated . although an estimate of this coupling in the derivative expansion of the extended njl model@xcite finds it to be small , it is conceivable that it might conspire to cancel some of the amplitude due to the intermediate scalar meson .",
    "however , as discussed in ref.@xcite , such a cancellation is not required by any underlying principle such as chiral symmetry .",
    "finally one should also note that , as already discussed , leading - order calculations in @xmath2 may not be sufficient to describe a process in which the scalar isoscalar channel plays a significant role .",
    "the dominant decay mode of the @xmath28 is to @xmath216 .",
    "although the parameter set b does give a credible , broad width , with set a the state seems to be very narrow .",
    "since the final state has a combined mass of @xmath217 mev , the allowed phase space for the decay is drastically reduced at the model @xmath28 masses as compared to the empirical mass . using parameter set a",
    ", the @xmath28 mass is only @xmath218 mev and so the small decay width of @xmath219 mev may simply be a consequence of the phase - space suppression .    in order to examine whether the @xmath220 coupling is reasonably well described by the model , we compare it with the description of the same process using a phenomenological mesonic lagrangian .",
    "the ccwz formalism originally developed in ref.@xcite is particularly convenient for this purpose since the @xmath28 mass can be set to any desired value without violating the constraints of chiral symmetry .",
    "a suitable lagrangian for the comparison is one obtained by converting the simplest lagrangian in the massive yang",

    "when we use the @xmath28 masses found in the model with parameter sets a and b , the effective lagrangian gives significantly smaller widths , @xmath224 and @xmath225 mev respectively .",
    "this suggests that the small widths found in the model are largely due to the the small @xmath28 mass rather than any underestimate of the coupling strength .",

    "further tests of models where mesons are constructed as @xmath4 composites are provided by electromagnetic processes and form factors that probe the internal meson structure . for this",
    "it is necessary to specify the photon - quark coupling , which requires additional assumptions about the form of the nonlocal current , as discussed in sec .",

    "the measured form factor is not well described by the model curve . a possible explanation is suggested by fig .  10 , which breaks the form factor down into its various contributions for @xmath266 .",
    "there is a substantial cancellation between the  bare \" and  vector \" contributions and so the result is likely to be very sensitive to fine details of the model in this regime .",
    "this is borne out by the strong dependence of the results in this region on the parameter set chosen .",
    "it is also responsible for the prominence of the rather strange structure just above the pseudo - threshold in fig .",
    "this cancellation between large amplitudes suggests that the results of the model should not be regarded as reliable in this region .    the use of the conserved current constructed in sec .",

    "it may be that there is some effect on this form factor due to the tail of the @xmath292 resonance@xcite .",
    "also , a potentially important missing ingredient in our calculation is @xmath293 mixing , since a calculation of this form factor within an su(3 ) effective lagrangian approach@xcite has found a significant dependence on the mixing strength .",
    "improved data would be needed to draw any firmer conclusions and there are hopes that the experimental situation will be indeed be clarified by forthcoming experiments at vepp-2 m or da@xmath294ne@xcite .    in this case ,",

    "the final results for all choices of parameters are much smaller than the experimental measurement@xcite of @xmath302 kev .",
    "we have investigated extended versions of the model proposed in ref.@xcite with nonlocal , four - fermion interactions , based on the separable form ( [ separable ] ) suggested by instanton - liquid studies@xcite .",
    "the interaction form factors ensure the convergence of all quark - loop integrals and , for most of the acceptable range of parameters , also lead to quark confinement  @xcite .",
    "the familiar problems of the njl model are therefore eliminated whilst retaining much of the simplicity of that approach .",
    "quark confinement is particularly important in applying such a model to heavier mesons than the pion , since it avoids a threshold for @xmath4 production occurring at an inconveniently low energy , as in the njl model .",
    "this feature of the nonlocal approach makes it especially well suited as the basis for the extended model that we study here , with interactions that bind vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "the analytic structure of the quark propagator , with poles at complex momenta , means that a scheme has to be specified for continuing amplitudes to minkowski space .",
    "we have used the scheme suggested by lee and wick@xcite and cutkosky _",
    "et al._@xcite , which leads to nonanalytic behaviour of the meson propagators above a pseudo - threshold .",
    "this behaviour ensures that no poles appear in the longitudinal vector channels",
    ". it also provides restrictions on both the admissible range of model parameters and the region of applicability of the model .    in order to calculate the pion decay constant , which sets the basic scale for the model , as well as electromagnetic couplings , we need to construct conserved currents that are consistent with our nonlocal interaction",
    "this has been done using the noether - like method of ref.@xcite .",
    "ward identities related to the current conservation follow automatically and several have been analytically checked , including the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation and the low - energy theorem for @xmath303 in the chiral limit .",
    "the latter involves the axial anomaly , which has formed a long - standing problem for the usual njl model with its cut - offs on the quark propagators .",
    "working at tree level in terms of mesons ( leading order in @xmath2 ) and to all orders in momentum , we have calculated the meson masses and various strong decay rates . when the @xmath6 mass is used to fix the strength of the relevant four - quark vertex , we find that the @xmath6-meson width is reasonably well described .",
    "in particular the model provides an improvement on the underestimated value obtained in the extended njl model@xcite . as in the njl model ,",
    "a light @xmath24 is found , with a mass similar to that found in a number of analyses of @xmath304 scattering@xcite .",
    "the calculated mass of the @xmath28 meson is somewhat lighter than the observed value . by cutting down the available phase - space",
    ", this also means that the model gives too small a width for the decay @xmath305 .",
    "various electromagnetic quantities have also been calculated in this model .",
    "the decay rates found in the model are in reasonably good agreement with the observed ones , except for the case of @xmath306 .",
    "the electromagnetic form factor of the pion agrees well with the data , at least below the @xmath6 pole .",
    "the form factors for @xmath307 and @xmath308 are also in agreement with the , admittedly rather limited , data currently available . we have also compared our results for electromagnetic form factors with vector - dominance formulae using on - shell couplings as calculated in the model .",
    "although diagrams where the photon couples directly to the quarks make a significant contribution , they combine with diagrams that involve an intermediate vector meson to give results that are very close to those of vmd , at least at low momenta .",
    "the model is thus able to provide some support for the idea of vector dominance in photon - meson interactions .",
    "overall the level of agreement with observed meson properties is satisfactory , given the simple nature of the model and the fact that important effects have not been included at the current level of approximation .",
    "it is desirable to extend the current work to include meson - loop effects ( @xmath2 corrections ) since these could be significant . in particular , they may be important for the scalar isoscalar channel , where the @xmath24 meson is very strongly coupled to two - pion states and where there are some indications that our leading - order calculations do not agree with phenomenological analyses .",
