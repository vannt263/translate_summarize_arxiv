    "a natural prediction of the hierarchical galaxy formation scenario is the ubiquitous presence of stellar haloes surrounding the galaxies ( e.g. eggen et al .",
    "1962 ; searle & zinn 1978 ; steinmetz & mller 1995 ; bekki & chiba 2001 ; samland & gerhard 2003 ) . these extended and diffuse stellar components are formed from the debris of disrupted satellites accreted along the cosmic time ( e.g. brook et al .",
    "2003 ; bullock & johnston 2005 ; abadi et al . 2006 ) .",
    "recent cosmological simulations predict that the amount of stellar mass in these haloes should be @xmath010@xmath3 - 10@xmath4m@xmath5 for milky way ( mw)-like objects .",
    "if these simulations are correct , most of the stellar halo mass would be assembled before z@xmath01 and we would expect since then a simple passive evolution of the stellar populations of these haloes towards the present ( e.g. cooper et al .",
    "2010 ; font et al .",
    "2011 ) .    from the observational point of view",
    ", the detection of stellar haloes is a major challenge .",
    "for example , morrison ( 1993 ) estimates the surface brightness of the galactic halo at the solar radius to be v@xmath027.7 mag / arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "in addition to the well - characterized mw halo ( see a recent review by helmi 2008 ) , deep surveys of m31 ( e.g. ferguson et al .",
    "2002 ; irwin et al . 2005 ; kalirai et al . 2006 ; ibata et al . 2007 ;",
    "mcconnachie et al .",
    "2009 ) have revealed an extensive halo ( to @xmath0150 kpc ) with abundant substructure .",
    "m33 seems also to have a halo similar to the mw and m31 , despite its smaller total mass ( mcconnachie et al .",
    ". beyond the local group , there is growing observational evidence showing that stellar haloes are ubiquitous and diverse .",
    "these studies have been conducted in nearby galaxies by using resolved star count techniques ( e.g. mouhcine et al .",
    "2005 , 2007 , 2010 ; ibata et al .",
    "2009 ; radburn - smith et al .",
    "2011 ) or by extremely deep integrated photometry observations able to detect low surface brightness features ( e.g. sackett et al .",
    "1994 ; shang et al . 1998 ; martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; jablonka et al . 2010 ; bakos & trujillo 2012 ) .",
    "zibetti et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see also bergvall et al .",
    "2010 ) , stacking 1047 galaxies , were able to observe the properties of stellar haloes up to z@xmath00.05 ( @xmath0200 mpc in distance ) .",
    "finally , zibetti & ferguson ( 2004 ) , using the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) , detected the stellar halo of a disc galaxy at z=0.32 .",
    "this last observation represents the current farthest detection of these faint components of the galaxies .",
    "the observed number and physical properties of the stellar streams in nearby galaxies are in general agreement with the predictions from the @xmath7 cold dark matter model ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2008 ; gilbert et al .",
    "2009 , mcconnachie et al . 2009 ; starkenburg et al . 2009",
    "; martnez - delgado et al . 2010 ) .",
    "even the large discrepancies in the properties of the stellar haloes of similar mass disc galaxies as the mw and m31 have been explained , within the cosmological context , as inherent to the system - to - system scatter in the halo formation histories of these objects ( e.g. font et al .",
    "2011 ) . to gain , consequently",
    ", a deeper understanding of the formation mechanisms of the disc galaxies is necessary : ( a ) to explore systematically the stellar haloes of nearby galaxies to even fainter surface brightness magnitudes ( v@xmath830 mag / arcsec@xmath6 ) where a plethora of substructures is expected to appear and ( b ) to probe the stellar haloes of high redshift disc galaxies , where the properties of the stellar haloes are caught in earlier episodes of assembly .",
    "this paper deals with the second possibility .",
    "in particular , if the stellar halo formation scenarios are correct , a cosmic epoch that it is worth exploring is z@xmath01 where , as mentioned before , the haloes should be already in place .",
    "if observing stellar haloes in the local universe is difficult , the observation of stellar haloes at z@xmath01 requires the deepest ever observations from the space . at z=1 ,",
    "the cosmological dimming is @xmath03 mag / arcsec@xmath6 and the optical red side of stellar emission ( which contains most of the stellar flux ) is only visible using near - infrared ( nir ) data .",
    "fortunately , the observations to start exploring the stellar haloes up to z@xmath01 have been recently taken by using the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging the hudf . in this pilot paper , we present for the first time the stellar haloes of two mw - like galaxies at z@xmath01 .",
    "we will show that these stellar haloes , in agreement with theoretical expectations , were much brighter and bluer than present - day stellar haloes of similar mass disc galaxies .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the data used in this paper , the selection of our sample and the profiles extraction , and in section 3 we present a detailed analysis of our results .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we perform a short discussion and a summary of our work .",
    "the paper is complemented with an extensive appendix where we expand on technical details used at conducting this article .",
    "all magnitudes in this paper are given in the ab system unless otherwise stated .",
    "throughout we assume a flat -dominated cosmology ( @xmath9=0.3 , @xmath10=0.7 , and h@xmath11=70 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ) .",
    "due to the faintness of the features we aim to explore in this paper , the study presented here requires the nowadays state - of - the - art imaging in terms of depth and resolution .",
    "this implies using the deepest optical and near - infrared imaging ever taken with the hst .",
    "the hudf ( r.a.=03:32:39.0 , dec = -27:47:29.1 ( j2000 ) ) is the point on the sky with the best hst data for this project .      in the optical regime ,",
    "the hudf has been observed ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) with the wfc of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) in four filters : f435w ( b ) , f606w ( v ) , f775w ( i ) and f850lp ( z ) .",
    "the total exposure time in each band is as follows : 134880s ( b ) , 135320s ( v ) , 347110s ( i ) and 346620s ( z ) , and the ab mag .",
    "zeropoints reached are : 25.673 ( b ) , 26.486 ( v ) , 25.654 ( i ) and 24.862 ( z ) .",
    "individual exposures in each filter were combined and drizzled to produce a single image per band with the following characteristics : 10500@xmath1310500 pixels with a pixel scale of 0.03 arcsec / pixel .",
    "these data were made public by the hudf team at the following webpage : http://archive.stsci.edu / pub / hlsp / udf / acs - wfc/.    in the nir , the hudf was observed both by the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) camera and more recently by the wfc3 .",
    "the wfc3 observations are deeper and with higher resolution than nicmos ; however , the wfc3 observations do not cover entirely the hudf field .",
    "for these reasons , in this paper , we have used both nir data sets .",
    "the nicmos hudf ( thompson et al . 2005 ) data consist on f110w and f160w drizzled images of 3500@xmath133500 pixels with a pixel scale of 0.09 arcsec / pixel .",

    "the zeropoints are : 26.27 ( f105w ) , 26.25 ( f125w ) and 25.96 ( f160w ) .",
    "the combined individual exposures in these filters were drizzled and have approximately 3000@xmath133000 pixels with a pixel scale of 0.06 arcsec / pixel .",

    "the selection of our galaxies was conducted using the rainbow cosmological database published by prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ; see also barro et al .",
    "( 2011a , b ) .",
    "this database is a vast compilation of photometric and spectroscopic data for several of the deepest cosmological fields , such as goods - north and south , cosmos , or the extended groth strip , among others . using all the available photometry , they have built spectral energy distributions ( seds ) covering the electromagnetic spectrum from the x - ray to the radio wavelengths .",
    "analysing these seds , they have derived very robust photometric redshifts and accurate estimates of various stellar parameters ( such as the stellar mass , the ultraviolet and infrared - based star formation rates , the stellar population age , etc . ) .",
    "we have selected from the rainbow data base those objects with spectroscopic redshift within 0.8@xmath2z@xmath21.2 and m@xmath14@xmath85@xmath1310@xmath4m@xmath5 ( kroupa 2001 imf ) .",
    "these constraints provide 15 galaxies .",
    "we have used the acs z - band imaging to visually explore these objects .",
    "two of these galaxies are ellipticals and are not considered in our study on what follows . from the remaining 13 galaxies , 9 objects are irregular or appear distorted by interactions .",
    "there are four bona fide spirals : udf3372 , udf4438 , udf5417 and udf9444 . from those ,",
    "we have finally selected only the two disc galaxies with the lowest inclinations .",
    "this mitigates potential effects of the dust on the surface brightness profiles we have obtained .",
    "in addition , while exploring the outer stellar haloes , less inclined galaxies are expected to be less affected by point spread function ( psf ) effects ( see de jong 2008 ) than edge - on orientations .",
    "the characteristics of our galaxies are shown in table 1 .",
    "we have also shown these objects ( in z and h bands ) in fig .",
    "1 . unfortunately",
    ", udf3372 is beyond the area covered by the hudf wfc3 pointing , so we have had to rely our analysis on the nir using the nicmos data .        [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ structure ]          following a similar analysis to the one presented in bakos & trujillo ( 2012 ) for local galaxies and as we have done earlier , we characterise the structural properties of the stellar haloes at high - z by decomposing the psf deconvolved r - band surface brightness rest - frame profile into three different components : a srsic r@xmath15 ( 1968 ) bulge , a double - exponential disc , and a stellar halo described by a srsic model with n=0.5 ( see fig .",
    "[ decomposition ] ) .",
    "this later choice seems somehow arbitrary but it has been chosen because it represents well the shape of the profile in the outer region .",
    "it also allows a direct comparison with the analysis of the stellar haloes conducted at z=0 .    in table 3",
    ", we provide the effective radii of the haloes and their mean surface brightness according to the rest - frame r - band . in the same table",
    ", we also show the fraction of light that is contained in the stellar haloes compared to the total light of the galaxies ( l@xmath16/l@xmath17 ) .",
    "the effective radii of our haloes ( r@xmath18@xmath017 kpc ) are within the range of the ones found in the local universe .",
    "the most important difference of the high - z stellar haloes compared to the local ones is in connection with their mean effective surface brightness . at high - z ,",
    "the values found @xmath19@xmath024.9 mag / arcsec@xmath6 ( r - band ) are significantly much brighter ( @xmath20 3 mag / arcsec@xmath6 ) than those measured in nearby galaxies .",
    "we finally have obtained the ( g - r ) colour at the stellar halo position by using the psf deconvolved model color profiles at 20@xmath2r@xmath225 kpc ( see fig .",
    "[ restprof ] ) .",
    "ideally , we would like to explore these colours farther away but the errors are so large that this estimation becomes prohibitive .",
    "for this reason , we concentrate on the above region .",
    "nonetheless , if we trust the bulge - disc - halo decomposition conducted here , these colours should not be significantly affected by the colours of the outer disc population after the psf effect correction . to be conservative ,",
    "the halo colour error as well as the error on the mean effective surface brightness of the halo is based on the observed error measured in the surface brightness and colour distributions at the farthest halo regions we can explore with confidence ( i.e. 20@xmath2r@xmath225 kpc ) .",
    "we acknowledge that these errors do not account for potential variations of the shape of the halo ( which we have fixed here to a gaussian n=0.5 shape ) .",
    "so , we warn the reader that there is a potential source of systematic bias that can not be easily quantified without having deeper and/or higher resolution images .          to put our high - z galaxies in context , we have compared the properties of their stellar haloes with the ones found in the local universe .",
    "the result of this comparison is presented in fig .",
    "[ comparison ] . in the left - hand panel , we have the light fraction of the stellar haloes ( in the restframe sdss r - band ) versus the total galaxy stellar mass .",
    "we have taken the local values from different authors .",
    "these works are listed in the caption of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "we find that the amount of light contained in the high - z stellar haloes is very similar to the values found in our local reference sample ( @xmath04% ) .",
    "this result implies that , whatever the complex mechanisms acting on the evolution of the galaxies as a whole and the stellar haloes as a separate component , they should produce a decrease of the brightness in both structures which is similar in order to preserve such fraction constant with time .    in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ comparison ] , we compare the mean effective surface brightness and the ( g - r ) color of the stellar haloes both at high and low - z . as we have been claiming through the paper , the stellar haloes at high - z are significantly much brighter than today",
    "also , their colours are bluer ( ( g - r)@xmath00.1 mag ) than in the local universe ( ( g - r)@xmath00.7 mag ; see also zibetti et al .",
    "2004 ; zackrisson et al . 2006 ; bergvall et al . 2010 ) .",
    "can the high - z stellar haloes in the high - z universe evolve into the ones that we observe locally by passive evolution ?",
    "the most simple exercise that we can conduct to address this question is to follow the tracks of single stellar populations ( ssps ) with cosmic time and to probe whether the passive evolution of the stellar population in the haloes can reproduce the local properties .",
    "these tracks have been constructed using the vazdekis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) models for ssps with two different imfs ( salpeter 1955 and kroupa 2001 ) .",
    "we find that the passive evolution moves the colour and the surface brightness of the high - z stellar haloes towards the observed values in the local universe .",
    "we explore the consequences of this finding in the next section .",
    "in the current paradigm , stellar haloes of galaxies have a dual nature . the outer halo formed primarily by accretion / mergers , whereas the inner halo is formed mainly through a dissipative collapse ( as a result of gas - rich mergers at early times ) .",
    "recent cosmological simulations ( e.g. cooper et al .",
    "2010 ; font et al . 2011 ; tissera et al .",
    "2012 ) indicate that both phenomena take place at z@xmath81 .",
    "if this is the case , one would expect that the stellar haloes will evolve since that epoch by mostly fading without any significant change in their structures .",
    "our present observations allow us to check this important prediction of the disc galaxy formation scenario .    according to our data ,",
    "the structural properties of our high - z stellar haloes are compatible with being at place at z@xmath01 .",
    "we base this assertion on the following : if we assume that the high - z haloes have the same shape than the local ones ( i.e. if they can be well described with n=0.5 profiles as it seems to be the case ) , then the sizes of these components ( r@xmath18@xmath017 kpc ) as well as their contribution to the total light of the galaxies ( @xmath04 per cent ) are very similar to the ones found in the local universe .",
    "the major difference with respect to the local galaxies is that our haloes are @xmath03 magnitudes brighter than their local counterparts .",
    "they also present bluer colors than the local stellar haloes .",
    "both results agree with the idea that high - z stellar haloes are significantly much younger than present - day ones . according to the ssp evolutionary tracks that we have explored",
    ", the colors of our high - z stellar haloes correspond to stellar populations with an age @xmath11 gyr .",
    "that implies that the stars in those haloes were formed basically at 1@xmath2z@xmath22 .",
    "this matches very well the theoretical predictions that move most of the formation of the stellar haloes at those epochs .",
    "our sample is so far very small ( only 2 objects ) , but this pilot work can be easily extended towards other spiral galaxies in the hudf at lower redshifts and with different inclinations .",
    "our two disc galaxies have not been pre - selected to have bright ( i.e. detectable ) stellar haloes but we admit we can not infer , with only two objects , whether this is the general behavior of the whole disc galaxy population at z@xmath01",
    ". it will be interesting to explore in the future whether other disc galaxies have prominent stellar haloes as the ones discussed in this paper .",
    "in addition , it will be worth probing whether the properties of other high - z stellar haloes also fit within a scenario where a pure passive evolution of their stellar populations matures them towards the present - day universe stellar haloes .",

    "the need to separate between the optical and nir regimes at creating the masks is justified by the significantly different psfs sizes and cameras characteristics . nonetheless , as we will see later , most of the regions masked in both regimes are in common being the nir- masked areas larger than in the optical as expected due to their larger psfs .",
    "the master images are a stack of the different filters scaled to the z - band flux ( optical ) and h - band flux ( nir ) .",
    "sources are extracted in the `` cold mode '' , optimized for brighter objects .",
    "we use some sextractor parameters such as the measured flux , elongation , and similar to determine the shape and size of these mask regions . in some cases ,",
    "problematic sources , saturated stars , for instance , are masked manually .",
    "since the masking is based on information coming from all filters in each regime , we use the resulting masks as mastermasks , and it is applied to all filters in the optical regime ( mastermask in the optical ) and in the nir ( mastermasks in the nir ) .",
    "we show in this section the effect of the psf on the surface brightness profiles of both galaxies and in all the bands used in this work . for the galaxy udf3372",
    ", we show the effect of the psf in fig .",
    "[ psfeffect3372 ] , and for the galaxy udf5417 in fig .",
    "[ psfeffect5417 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the excess of light above the psf model prediction is observed in all the profiles except in the f160w nicmos profile of the galaxy udf3372 .",
    "the effect of the psf in that band is so large that does not permit exploring any potential stellar halo light at those distances .",
    "also , in the f435w band , in both galaxies , the data is not deep enough to explore the presence of a stellar halo at those ( ultraviolet rest - frame ) wavelengths .",
    "in this appendix , we show the bulge - disc - stellar halo decomposition for the two galaxies explored in this work in all the bands that we have used in this paper .",
    "the results of doing this decomposition are presented in fig .",
    "[ bulgedischalo3372 ] for udf3372 and fig .",
    "[ bulgedischalo5417 ] for udf5417 .",
    "in this work , we have assumed that the surface brightness distribution of the stellar halo follows a gaussian distribution ( i.e. a srsic model with a n index fixed to n=0.5 ) .",
    "this is done for two reasons : first , it produces a fit in all the bands which agrees very well with the data distribution , and secondly , it allow us to compare with the results obtained in the local sample by bakos & trujillo ( 2012 ) , where this model was used to extract the properties of the stellar haloes .",
    "nonetheless , the exact determination of the shape of the stellar halo is uncertain due to the limited spatial range that we can cover with our observations ( not reliable beyond 40 kpc ) .",
    "for that reason , we have repeated our full analysis based on an exponential distribution for the outer component .",
    "some of the values obtained directly from this analysis can not be straightforward compared with the local sample by bakos & trujillo ( 2012 ) as those values ( for instance : the mean surface brightness , the effective radius of the halo , etc . )",
    "strongly depend on the model used to fit the outer component ( see e.g. table 3 of gilbert et al .",
    "2012 ) . however , other parameters such as the fraction of light in the stellar halo compared to the total luminosity of the galaxy and/or the colour - corrected profiles help to probe how dependent are our results on the chosen shape for the stellar outer component .    exponential profiles for fitting the outer component of the stellar halo produce larger effective radii and fainter surface brightnesses ( udf3372 : r@xmath18=47.2@xmath215.7 kpc , @xmath2@xmath22@xmath8=26.4@xmath210.3 mag / arcsec@xmath6 ( r - band restframe ) ; udf5417 : r@xmath18=44.1@xmath212.2 kpc , @xmath2@xmath22@xmath8=26.4@xmath210.1 mag / arcsec@xmath6 ( r - band rest frame ) ) that in the case of gaussian models .",
    "the stellar halo light contributions using exponential model raise to 9.1@xmath212.3 per cent ( udf3372 ) and 6.5@xmath210.7 per cent ( udf5417 ) .",
    "this is understable due to the larger amount of light that is located on the tail of an exponential model compared to a gaussian distribution . nonetheless , in the case of udf5417 , where our data are most reliable and deep , the stellar halo light contribution using both models are relatively similar .",
    "finally , we have explored how the colour correction we have applied due to the effect of the psf in our surface brightness profiles is altered when we use an exponential model . in fig .",
    "[ colorexponential ] , we show the u , g and r rest - frame surface brightness profiles as well as the u - g and g - r colors psf corrected radial profiles when using an exponential model to fit the outer region .",
    "that figure shows that , within the error bars , the psf color corrected radial profiles are not significantly different assuming a gaussian or an exponential model ."
