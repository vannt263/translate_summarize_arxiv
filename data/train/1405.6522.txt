    "@xmath3 transition metal oxides have recently attracted considerable interest as they display unusual properties primarily resulting from the effect of large spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the electronic nature of sr@xmath7iro@xmath8@xcite and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10@xcite : despite the large @xmath3 bandwidth and weak correlation , both of which favour a metallic character , these systems are insulators .",
    "the opening of an electronic gap has been explained by means of a hubbard - like model , in which the effect of correlation is enhanced by the strong spin - orbit coupling which narrows the effective @xmath3 bandwidth isolating the so - called @xmath11 state@xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 state results from a particular hierarchy of energies at play , most especially the crystal field and the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 ( sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 ) is the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) member of the ruddlesden - popper series , sr@xmath0ir@xmath1o@xmath2 , and is built by the stacking of iro@xmath7 ( bi-)layers , in which iro@xmath14 octahedra share the corner oxygens .",
    "the dominant perturbation to the half - filled @xmath3 iridium states in these compounds comes from the cubic component of the crystal field , written conventionally as @xmath6 .",
    "indeed the @xmath4@xmath5 splitting , of order several ev , is often considered to be large enough that the @xmath5 states can be neglected , allowing the basic electronic structure to be understood in terms of a single hole occupying the @xmath4 orbitals ( tetravalent iridium is @xmath15 ) . in order to describe",
    "properly the ground state wave function of this hole , spin - orbit coupling and residual crystal - field effects with symmetry lower than cubic , such as tetragonal in the post - perovskite cairo@xmath9@xcite or trigonal in pyrochlore r@xmath7ir@xmath7o@xmath10 ( r = rare earth element)@xcite , need to be considered . at the single - ion level , this is achieved by diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath16 in the @xmath4 orbitals basis - set@xcite , where @xmath17 is the spin - orbit coupling and @xmath18 is the tetragonal ( trigonal ) crystal - field splitting .",
    "strictly speaking , the @xmath11 ground state is realized only for @xmath19 , i.e. for a perfectly cubic symmetry . in real materials",
    "this condition is relaxed to @xmath20 .",
    "estimates of @xmath18 in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 ( @xmath21 ev@xcite ) and its sister compound ba@xmath7iro@xmath8(@xmath22 ev@xcite ) indeed confirm that the requirement on the relative magnitude of @xmath23 and @xmath17 is realized , since the spin - orbit coupling in these materials of order @xmath240.5 ev@xcite .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that the scenario of the @xmath11 ground state holds true only when the @xmath5 states do not contribute to the ground state wave function , i.e. if the cubic component of the crystal field @xmath6 is much larger than the spin - orbit coupling , @xmath25 .",
    "indeed , the contribution of the @xmath5 states has been invoked as a possible cause of the departure of cairo@xmath9 from the pure @xmath11 ground state in lda+so+u calculations@xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates of @xmath6 in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 range from 1.8@xcite to 5 ev@xcite .",
    "experimentally , various x - ray techniques have been used to estimate @xmath6 , including x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) , resonant elastic ( rexs ) and inelastic ( rixs ) x - ray scattering .",
    "for example , soft xas at the o k edge has been used to probe the empty iridium 5@xmath26 states through hybridization with the oxygen 2@xmath27 orbitals@xcite , providing values of @xmath6 for sr@xmath7iro@xmath8@xcite and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10@xcite in the range 2.5 ev to 4 ev . however , this particular technique is highly surface sensitive , especially when performed in total - electron - yield ( tey ) mode , which compromises the reliability of the extracted value of @xmath6 .",
    "the possibility that surface and bulk properties might be different in iridium oxides was highlighted by liu _",
    "et al . _ , who reported the existence of weak metallicity in the near - surface electronic structure of sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 while its bulk is known to be insulating@xcite .",
    "in addition to the surface sensitivity , one has to deal with self - absorption effects in total - fluorescence - yield ( tfy ) detected xas . as self - absorption",
    "is dependent on photon energy and experimental geometry , extreme caution has to be taken when corrections to the spectra are applied .",
    "xas at the ir l@xmath28 edges ensures bulk - sensitivity , but self - absorption equally affects hard xas in tfy mode .",
    "moreover , it suffers from the sizeable broadening of features due to the 2@xmath27 core - hole lifetime which obscures details of the electronic structure close to the fermi energy .",
    "this problem can at least be overcome to a certain degree by measuring partial - fluorescence - yield ( pfy ) detected xas@xcite : this technique provides very similar information to that of conventional xas , but with the advantage that a shallower core - hole is left in the final state of the decay process selected by energy - discriminating the photons emitted due to radiative decay .",
    "for example , in the case of the @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) emission line of iridium , if @xmath31 is the lifetime broadening of the @xmath32 core - hole , and @xmath33 is that of the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) core - hole , then the pfy broadening will be given by @xmath36 , since @xmath37 .",
    "however , even if the benefits of pfy xas are evident , it is still difficult to extract quantitative information on @xmath6 from such measurements@xcite .",
    "resonant x - ray magnetic scattering ( rxms)@xcite and resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs)@xcite in the hard x - ray regime also provide rough estimates of the cubic component of the crystal field from the rxms / rixs energy dependence .",
    "indeed , that the intensity of both magnetic reflections in rxms and intra-@xmath4 excitations in rixs are enhanced a few ev below the main absorption line has been interpreted as a signature of the @xmath4@xmath5 splitting . again , however , both of these techniques suffer from self - absorption effects due to the proximity of the scattered photon energy to the ir l@xmath28 absorption edges .",
    "the present work was designed to provide a reliable , bulk - sensitive probe of the electronic structure of iridium oxides .",
    "we therefore used non - resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( nixs ) in the hard x - ray energy range , more specifically x - ray raman spectroscopy ( xrs ) , to probe the bulk properties of iridium oxides .",
    "xrs is a x - ray scattering technique in which the energy of the incoming and scattered photons is far from absorption edges of the material , making xrs a self - absorption - free and bulk - sensitive probe@xcite .",
    "indeed , the xrs cross - section in the limit of small momentum transfer @xmath38 ( i.e. in the dipole limit ) is formally identical to that of xas , with @xmath39 playing the role of photon polarization : the xrs cross - sections is then proportional to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the many - body electronic wave functions of the initial and final state of the system , respectively@xcite .",
    "the main drawback of this technique is the low count - rate , which is partially overcome by collecting the scattered photons over a large solid angle . in the following",
    "we show that xrs allows the precise determination of the cubic component of the crystal - field splitting in the compounds sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 , thus offering an alternative spectroscopic tool for the investigation of the electronic structure of iridium oxides .",
    "x - ray raman spectroscopy measurements were performed at the id20 beam line of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , grenoble .",
    "the x - rays produced by four u26 undulators were monochromatized to an energy - resolution of @xmath43 ev by the simultaneous use of a si(111 ) high heat - load liquid - nitrogen cooled monochromator and a si(311 ) post - monochromator .",
    "the x - rays were then focused at the sample position by means of a kirkpatrick - baez mirror system down to a spot size of @xmath44 @xmath45m@xmath46 ( vertical @xmath47 horizontal , fwhm ) .",
    "the scattered x - rays were collected by 12 crystal - analyzers exploiting the si(660 ) reflection close to backscattering geometry ( at a fixed bragg angle of @xmath48 , corresponding to @xmath49 ev ) and detected by a maxipix detector@xcite with pixel size of @xmath50 @xmath45m@xmath46 .",
    "the resulting energy resolution was @xmath51 ev . in order to obtain the xrs spectrum ,",
    "the incident photon energy @xmath52 was varied in the energy range from @xmath53 ( the elastic energy ) to @xmath54 ev , thus covering the oxygen k edge .",
    "the accumulation time / spectrum was about 2 hours and several spectra were recorded to improve the counting statistics .",
    "xrs spectra were collected in two different scattering geometries , corresponding to the momentum transfer @xmath39 along the sample @xmath55-axis and in the @xmath56-plane , respectively . in both geometries ,",
    "the scattering plane was vertical and the incident x - rays linearly polarized in the horizontal plane .",
    "xas spectra were recorded at the id08 beam line of the esrf in the tfy mode .",
    "single crystals of sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 , with dimensions of @xmath57 mm@xmath58 , were were grown using the flux method described in ref . .",
    "all spectra were recorded at room temperature .",
    "xrs spectra of ( a ) sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and ( b ) sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 for transferred momenta @xmath59 ( black ) and @xmath60 ( red dots ) with @xmath61 @xmath62 ( scattering angle @xmath63 ) .",
    "gray triangles in ( b ) represent the xrs spectrum of sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 with @xmath64 @xmath62 ( scattering angle @xmath65 ) .",
    "xas spectra at the o k edge of the two compounds for incoming polarization @xmath66 ( black ) and @xmath67 ( red line ) are also shown in the insets . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows xrs scans for sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 ( a ) and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 ( b ) across the oxygen k edge for @xmath68 ( black ) and @xmath69 ( red dots ) .",
    "the scattering angle was fixed to @xmath70 , corresponding to a momentum transfer of @xmath71 @xmath62 .",
    "the background was removed by subtracting a linear fit to the pre - edge region at energies lower than 528 ev .",
    "the spectra were then normalized to unit area .",
    "for both samples , spectra taken in the two geometries are distinctly different , revealing a very strong orientation dependence of the xrs signal .",
    "in particular , one notes a large change of spectral weight between the two main features in the 530 - 535 ev energy range .    in agreement with xas results@xcite ,",
    "the 528 - 535 ev energy region is dominated by transitions to the ir 5@xmath26 states through the hybridization with o 2@xmath27 orbitals , while higher energy features correspond to excitations involving ir 6@xmath72 , 6@xmath27 and sr 4@xmath26 states@xcite , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . for comparison ,",
    "tfy xas spectra were measured on the very same samples .",
    "these are shown in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "continuous black and red lines correspond to orthogonal directions of the photon polarization , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the overall shape is similar to that of the xrs spectra , but the dichroic effect in the xas spectra is very small , in stark contrast to the strong orientation dependence of the xrs measurements performed on the same samples . in order to rule out any contribution higher than dipolar to the xrs spectra , we investigated the @xmath38 dependence of the xrs cross - section in sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 : by setting @xmath73 , corresponding to @xmath64 @xmath62 ( gray triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) ) , we note that the overall shape of the spectrum perfectly matches with that acquired for @xmath61 @xmath62 , thus implying that the momentum dependence of the xrs is negligible .",
    "we therefore attribute the discrepancy between xrs and xas measurements to potential surface and/or self - absorption effects affecting soft x - ray techniques .",
    "this observation underlines the importance of complementing surface - sensitive techniques with bulk - sensitive probes .    in order to analyse our data",
    "we have calculated the number of peaks expected in the 530 - 535 ev energy interval and their corresponding spectral weights by pursuing the analogy between the xrs and xas cross - sections .",
    "the relevant transitions are those from o @xmath74 to @xmath75 states with the latter hybridised with the ir 5@xmath26 orbitals@xcite .",
    "the hybridization strength is calculated according to the orbital overlap model @xcite with the hopping integral @xmath76 written as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant depending on the bond type ( @xmath45=@xmath79 or @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 is the ir - o distance ( @xmath82   and @xmath83   for apical and in - plane oxygens , respectively , in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8@xcite ; while @xmath84   and @xmath85   in sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10@xcite ) and @xmath86@xcite . it should be noted that @xmath87 and @xmath88 are related by @xmath89@xcite .",
    "since the hybridization strength is inversely proportional to the distance between the atoms involved , we can distinguish the contributions of the apical ( a ) and in - plane ( p ) oxygens .",
    "let us consider the apical oxygens first : the o @xmath90 state hybridizes with the ir @xmath3 @xmath91 states , while the @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) mixes with the @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) orbitals . for the in - plane oxygens , @xmath90 hybridizes with the @xmath95 and @xmath94 orbitals , while @xmath92 and @xmath93 are mixed with the @xmath96 , @xmath91 and @xmath97 orbitals .",
    "this is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .    sketch of the symmetry of the @xmath4 ( top ) and @xmath5 ( bottom ) orbitals involved in the o @xmath75-ir @xmath3 hybridization . the eulerian angles @xmath98 and @xmath99 describing the direction of @xmath100 or @xmath39 in the sample reference system are also shown . ]",
    "it remains to consider the cross - sections associated with transitions to different orbitals . in the framework of a single - ion model ,",
    "these are obtained by calculating the matrix elements corresponding to the dipolar @xmath101 transitions ( @xmath102)@xcite . the cross - section is proportional to the product of @xmath103 , @xmath104 the number of available final @xmath3 states and a polarisation factor . the polarization ( transferred momentum ) dependence of the xas ( xrs , in the dipole limit ) cross - sections to the @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath90 states are given by @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the eulerian angles describing the direction of @xmath100 ( @xmath39 ) in the sample reference system , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . merging the cross - section angular dependence and the hybridization between ir @xmath3-o @xmath75 states",
    ", we obtain the polarization ( transferred momentum ) dependence of the transitions to the @xmath96 , @xmath95 , @xmath94 , @xmath91 , @xmath97 orbitals as reported in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "note that we have used @xmath108 and @xmath109 expected for the @xmath11 state .",
    ".[tab : table1]polarization dependence of the o @xmath110 o @xmath75-ir @xmath3 dipolar transitions . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we are now in a position to extract the cubic component of the crystal field @xmath6 .",
    "this is given by the energy difference between the centres of mass of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 states for in - plane oxygens . in view of the small tetragonal crystal field measured in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8",
    "( @xmath111 ev@xcite ) , we consider the splitting of the @xmath4 states due to spin - orbit coupling only in the calculation of @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain @xmath112 ev in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and @xmath113 ev in sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 , assuming @xmath114 ev@xcite .",
    "estimates of @xmath6 extracted from xas and rxms / rixs measurements are consistent with our results .",
    "the cubic component of the crystal field is thus very large compared to the other energy scales of the system , namely the spin orbit coupling and the tetragonal crystal field , therefore validating the initial hypothesis that @xmath6 is the dominant energy scale .",
    "finally , in addition to the estimate of the cubic component of the crystal field , we can deduce the sign of the tetragonal contribution to the crystal field from the splitting of the @xmath5 states ( @xmath115 ev in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and by @xmath116 ev in sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 ) .",
    "indeed , the fact that the @xmath97 orbital is the highest in energy is consistent with structural studies indicating an elongation of the iro@xmath14 cage in both compounds .",
    "note that , for tetragonally distorted octahedra , the description of @xmath26 states requires two parameters , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , in addition to the main crystal - field parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the splitting of @xmath5 and @xmath4 states is then given by @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) , respectively@xcite . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling ,",
    "the @xmath4 states are almost degenerate ( @xmath122 ) , implying @xmath123 .",
    "a finite splitting of the @xmath5 states is therefore compatible with the realization of the @xmath11 ground state in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 .",
    "by exploiting the orientation dependence of oxygen k edge xrs cross - sections in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 , we have been able to assign spectral features in the 528 - 535 ev energy range to specific transitions involving the ir @xmath3 orbitals .",
    "these assignments allow us to extract the value of the cubic crystal - field splitting @xmath6 of @xmath124 and @xmath113 ev in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "in addition , the tetragonal crystal field was found to split the @xmath5 states by @xmath115 ev in sr@xmath7iro@xmath8 and by @xmath116 ev in sr@xmath9ir@xmath7o@xmath10 .",
    "it is important to stress that the reliability of these values of the crystal field splittings obtained in our study is enhanced by the bulk sensitivity of the xrs technique .",
