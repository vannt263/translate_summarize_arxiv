    "<S> though the underlying physical effect , nonlinear four - wave mixing , is purely deterministic and well understood , it is also well known that a deterministic dynamical description is not fully adequate in this problem , and statistical tools such as entropy and complexity measures should be used to characterize the complex fluctuations in the generated output signals . within this framework of wave turbulence , </S>",
    "<S> the role of  temperature \" is played by optical noise that occurs in the gain medium , which in fibre lasers leads to an effective  nonlinear noise \" due to four - wave - mixing .    </S>",

    "<S> was shown to be accompanied by the occurrence of coherent spatio - temporal structures @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we address an important question relevant to practical identification of such structures : are there underlying correlations and/or specific time - scales in the easily measurable intensity fluctuations of laser radiation ? in order to investigate this issue we use two nonlinear analysis tools : ordinal analysis @xcite and the horizontal visibility graph @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we show that both methods allow to clearly identify the presence of long - range temporal correlations in the experimentally measured laser output intensity .    in our experiments , </S>",

    "<S> ( d ) number of intensity peaks vs the pump power for various thresholds ( threshold values are shown by different colours).,title=\"fig : \" ]    as a starting step of our analysis , we generate two new data sets from experimentally measured intensity dynamics , @xmath1 . in particular , we filter out from the initial intensity dynamics only local intensity peaks and create a sequence of intensity peak heights , @xmath4 , which are above a certain threshold , also shown in fig . 1(a ) . because each time series is normalized to zero mean and unit variance , the thresholds used are in units of the standard deviation , @xmath5 : with threshold 0 , the peaks considered are only those above the mean value ; with threshold 1 , the peaks are only those above @xmath5 . the number of the peaks found in intensity dynamics measured at different pump power level is shown on fig . </S>",

    "<S> we note that , if the threshold is low , the number of peaks decreases with the pump power , but if the threshold is high , the number of peaks increases with the pump power until 0.9 w , where it is maximum , then , with further increase of the pump power , the number of peaks diminishes . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between two different generation regimes  laminar and turbulent regime  could be easily detected at 0.9 w. in the following we fix the threshold equal to 2 , i.e. , we analyze only the intensity peaks that are above @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> as each local intensity peak has also a time instant @xmath7 at which it occurs , we generate in parallel another data set : a sequence of time intervals between local intensity peaks , @xmath8 .    to investigate the complexity of the dynamics and to uncover hidden temporal correlations we use two methods of time - series analysis , which are represented schematically in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) . the first one , known as _ </S>",
    "<S> ordinal analysis _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , transforms a time series @xmath9 ( where @xmath9 is either the sequence of peak heights , @xmath4 , or the sequence of time intervals between peaks , @xmath8 ) into a sequence of symbols ( referred to as ordinal patterns , ops ) , by considering the order relation among @xmath10 values of the time - series . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there are 2 different ordinary patterns of length 2 : pattern ` 01 ' if @xmath11 and pattern ` 10 ' if @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath13 , there are 6 possible patterns : @xmath14 gives ` 012 ' , @xmath15 gives ` 210 ' , etc . </S>",
    "<S> the number of possible patterns of the given length @xmath10 is @xmath16 . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , a sequence of patterns could be generated from the sequence of the peak heights or from the sequence of time intervals between the peaks .    </S>",
    "<S> after defining the sequence of patterns , one can calculate the probability to find the given pattern in the data set , @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy computed from their probabilities , @xmath17 , of occurrence in the time series , @xmath18 , known as permutation entropy , has been shown to be an appropriated measure of the complexity of a time - series @xcite . when there are no serial correlations in the time - series @xmath9 , then all the patterns are equally probable and @xmath19 . on the contrary , when there are serial correlations , then the ops are not all equally probable , and the permutation entropy will be @xmath20 . in the following we refer to the normalized entropy , @xmath21 , as pe entropy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , with an appropriate choice of pattern length @xmath10 , the op probabilities and the pe entropy will capture the existence of underlying correlations in the time series .    to verify independently presence of correlations </S>",
    "<S> , we also apply the so - called _ horizontal visibility graph _ ( hvg ) method  @xcite . in this approach a time series , @xmath9 , is converted into a graph by considering each data point , @xmath22 , as a node . </S>",
    "<S> any two nodes are connected by a link ( or edge ) if horizontal visibility exists between them [ see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) ] : @xmath22 and @xmath23 are connected if it is possible to trace a horizontal line linking @xmath22 and @xmath23 not intersecting intermediate data ; mathematically , this means that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are connected if : @xmath24 for all @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> note that this graph representation of the time series @xmath9 takes into account both , the order and the values of the data points . </S>",
    "<S> time series with different dynamics are mapped into graphs that exhibit distinct topological structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the topology of a graph is characterized by the degree distribution , @xmath26 , that is the probability that a node has @xmath27 links . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the entropy of the degree distribution , @xmath28 ( in the following , referred to as hvg entropy ) , is another measure of the complexity of the time series @xmath9  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hvg method also allows to analyze different time - scales by constructing the graph not from all the `` raw '' data points , but from lagged data : @xmath29 .    </S>",
    "<S> while both analysis methods share the common feature of transforming the time series @xmath9 into a sequence of integer numbers , @xmath30 ( in the op case , @xmath31 $ ] is the pattern label : if ` 01 ' , @xmath32 ; if ` 10 ' , @xmath33 , etc . ; in the hvg case , @xmath34 $ ] is the degree of @xmath22 , with @xmath35 being the number of data points in the time series ) , they have important differences : while the op method requires the pre - definition of the length of the pattern @xmath10 , and does not take into account the values of the data points , the horizontal visibility graph method does not require to pre - define an analysis length , and considers both , the order relation and the actual values of the data points .     </S>",
    "<S> vs the pump power calculated from the sequence of ( a ) intensity peaks and ( b ) time intervals between consecutive peaks . </S>",
    "<S> permutation entropy ( c ) and hvg - entropy ( d ) calculated from the sequence of intensity peaks . ]    figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) display the probabilities of the six patterns of length 3 calculated from the sequence of intensity peaks and from the sequence of the time intervals , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the variation of the probabilities with the pump power captures the transition between two dynamical regimes : below the transition the ops are equally probable , while during the transition from laminar to turbulent regime their probabilities are different from equiprobability . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be noticed that , during the transition , the patterns 012 and 210 become more probable ( less probable ) when the ops are calculated from the @xmath4 sequence ( from the @xmath8 sequence ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the patterns calculated from the intensity peaks capture more determinism than those computed from the time intervals [ notice the difference in the vertical scales of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and 2(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the timing of the high intensity peaks is more random than their peak values .    </S>",
    "<S> the pe entropy , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) , quantifies this effect by decreasing sharply at the transition power . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior is observed when computing the hvg - entropy , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that , during the transition , the op probabilities ( both , for the intensity peaks and for the time intervals ) are not consistent with the null hypothesis of full stochasticity : the probabilities lie outside the region consistent with random ops , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath35 being the number of data points @xcite . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) the pe - entropy was computed from @xmath13 ops ; a similar plot was obtained with @xmath39 and @xmath40 ops ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> larger @xmath10 values were not considered due to the finite length of the dataset : while the `` raw '' intensity time series contains 50 million data points , the number of high intensity peaks ( above @xmath6 ) shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) is about @xmath41 , depending on the pump power .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) pdf - entropy calculated from the distribution of intensity values . ]    the probabilities of patterns 012 and 210 provide a measure of the persistence of the time - series , i.e. , the probability that the sign of @xmath42 persists in the next step @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , at the transition , if there are two consecutive peaks with increasing height , the next peak is likely to be larger than the previous one ( and if there are two consecutive peaks with decreasing height , the next one is likely to be smaller than the previous one ) ; on the contrary , in the sequence of time - intervals , two consecutive intervals that are increasingly long ( @xmath43 ) are likely to be followed by shorter interval ( @xmath44 ) , and two consecutive decreasing intervals ( @xmath45 ) are likely to be followed by a longer one ( @xmath46 ) .        </S>",
    "<S> let us note that the optimal value of pattern length @xmath10 depends of the length of correlations embedded into the time series @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to investigate the presence of specific time - scales in the dynamics , we analyze the lagged time series , i.e. the sequence of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the lag time . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering the case @xmath49 ( i.e. , we analyze all data points ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(a ) displays the pe entropy and the hvg entropy vs the pump power , and same behavior is seen in both entropies : there is a clear transition at pump power 0.9 w , where both entropies smoothly decrease . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that for the highest pump power , both entropies increase again . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals that during the transition there is an increase in the `` ordering '' of consecutive intensity values ( that is captured by both entropies , which decrease ) , but for the highest pump power the trend reverses and the disorder increases . in contrast , the entropy computed in the conventional way and referred as pdf - entropy ( i.e. the entropy calculated from the intensity pdfs of the initial intensity dynamics , i(t ) ) does not capture this behavior : as it can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( b ) , after the transition the pdf - entropy monotonously decreases with the pump power . thus , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 and @xmath51 provide consistent information , which complements that gained from the standard pdf - entropy . the good agreement between the pe and hvg entropies , also seen in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) and 2(d ) , is remarkable because the two methods transform a time series into a sequence of integer numbers by using very different encoding rules .    by varying the value of the lag time @xmath48 , i.e. by taking into account not all points in data sets , but every second ( @xmath52 ) point , every third ( @xmath53 ) point etc . </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to identify a specific oscillation time - scale in the intensity time - series during the transition . the pe entropy vs @xmath48 for pump powers below ( 0.85 w ) , at ( 0.90 w ) and above ( 0.95 w ) the transition is displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we can notice that , at the transition , there are specific lags for which the pe entropy decreases sharply . </S>",
    "<S> similar results were obtained with the hvg entropy .    </S>",
    "<S> the sharp minima indicate that , for pump power 0.90 w and for specific lags , 6 different patterns of length @xmath13 are not all equally probable , and thus , there are serial correlations in the sequence of lagged intensity values . to explore the length of such correlations , we computed the pe entropy using longer ordinary patterns ( @xmath39 and @xmath54 ) and found that the minima were more pronounced , revealing the existence of long serial correlations . </S>",
    "<S> these correlations are not captured by the classical autocorrelation function shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the pump power is 0.9w.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to investigate the nature of these correlations we plot on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) how the probabilities of 6 different ordinary patterns of length @xmath13 depend on the lag time . </S>",
    "<S> we note a periodic alternation in which 012 and 210 became the more probable or the less probable patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the probabilities of the other four patterns are similar ( no clear clusters are seen ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lag values for which 012 and 210 are less probable correspond , as expected , to the lag values where the autocorrelation function is minimum ( and negative ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , unexpectedly , the lag values for which 012 and 210 are more probable , do not correspond to the maxima of the autocorrelation ; and moreover , for the lag values where the autocorrelation is maxima , the all six ordinary patterns have similar probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest that ordinal analysis identifies subtle correlations in the _ ordering _ of data points , which are not seen by the standard autocorrelation function , that measures correlations in the _ values _ of the data points .    </S>",
    "<S> these `` order correlations '' result into different types of spatio - temporal patterns . </S>",
    "<S> let us recall that the initial intensity spatio - temporal dynamics could be seen as intensity spatio - temporal dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar concept has been recently employed for studying interaction of cavity solitons @xcite and topological solitons as addressable bits @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we apply this concept and choose specific lag times defined from fig.5(a ) ( shown by arrows ) to be used as round - trip times in processing of the initial data series ( see @xcite for details of plotting spatio - temporal dynamics ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures 5(b)-(d ) display examples with lags such that patterns 012 and 210 are as probable [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) ] , more probable [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(c ) ] ) and less probable [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(d ) ] than the other four patterns . </S>",
    "<S> we can see that these spatio - temporal dynamics of patterns display clear and different coherent structures . </S>",
    "<S> these observations can be useful for confronting the predictions of state - of - the - art laser models with empirical data , and the theoretical studies could provide insight into the physical mechanisms underlying these correlations .    to summarize , by applying two independent tools of nonlinear time - series analysis we have uncovered long - range temporal correlations in the intensity output of a fibre laser during the transition to a wave turbulence regime . </S>",
    "<S> output of laser radiation is easily measurable , making these easily implementable methods useful and valuable techniques for investigating coherent structures in complex laser radiation . </S>",
    "<S> both approaches can be applied to any high - dimensional complex systems that undergo similar transitions accompanied by the generation of extreme fluctuations . </S>"
