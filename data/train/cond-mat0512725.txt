    "magnetoelectric and specifically multiferroic magnetoelectrics have attracted renewed attention , @xcite although the field has a long history .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , bulk materials that provide strong coupling between electric and magnetic fields at room temperature remain elusive .",
    "some of the difficulties in realizing such materials were reviewed by hill .",
    "@xcite perovskite and perovskite derived phases , @xmath3o@xmath0 , provide the main inorganic ferroelectric materials used in applications .",
    "these are based on a cubic lattice with @xmath4 ions on the cube corners and @xmath5 ions at the cube centers , inside corner sharing octahedral o cages , ferroelectric perovskites can be classified as @xmath4-site or @xmath5-site driven according to which ion is primarily responsible for the polar instability .",
    "one strategy for synthesizing multiferroics is to substitute one of the perovskite sites with magnetic ions in materials where the ferroelectricity is driven by the other site , as for example in bifeo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite however , in both @xmath4 and @xmath5-site driven materials the ferroelectricity generally involves cooperation between off - centerings of both cations , and furthermore covalency between unoccupied metal states and o @xmath1 states is important for the ferroelectric instability .",
    "@xcite from this point of view , v@xmath6 may be a particularly interesting ion for multiferroics .    in oxides",
    ", v@xmath6 is often magnetic and , significantly , can occur either at the centers of octahedral cages , as in cavo@xmath0 and srvo@xmath0 , in which case there are interesting metal insulator transitions of mott character , @xcite or it can strongly bind to one o forming forming a vanadyl ion with very short bond length , @xmath7  .",
    "these vanadyl containing compouds are local moment magnets due to the formation of spin 1/2 moments on the v ions , and are band insulators , the band gaps are formed by a combination of strong crystal field splitting associated with the short v - o distance , and on - site hund s coupling , which exchange splits the 1/2 filled v non - bonding orbital .",
    "@xcite thus , perovskite vanadates offer the possibility of combining a magnetic @xmath5-site ion with insulating behavior and stereochemical activity on both the @xmath4 and @xmath5-sites .",
    "this was recently realized by the high pressure synthesis of pbvo@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    pbvo@xmath0 is insulating and occurs in the tetragonal , non - centrosymmetric structure , spacegroup @xmath8 , like pbtio@xmath0 , but with a very large tetragonality , @xmath9 .",
    "the structural distortion may be described as off - centering of pb and v accompanied by a distortion of the vo@xmath10 octahedral cage .",
    "this is in contrast to cavo@xmath0 and srvo@xmath0 , which have centrosymmetric gdfeo@xmath0 type structures deriving from octahedral tilting .",
    "pbvo@xmath0 shows no structural transitions from 0k to the decomposition temperature .",
    "however , a tetragonal to cubic transition does occur under pressure , @xcite indicating the possibility of ferroelectric behavior under pressure and perhaps by chemical modification .",
    "it is noteworthy that at 300k the shortest v - o distance is 1.67  , which is longer than in most other vanadyl containing oxides .",
    "this implies that the vanadyl bond is relatively weak in pbvo@xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , because of the connection between the short v - o bond and the moment formation , one may anticipate the possibility of coupling between magnetism and the structural distortion , which in turn , if ferroelectric , would be coupled to external electric field .",
    "significantly , the pb displacement with respect to the center of its o cage is 0.92  , and the v displacement is 0.60  .",
    "these are large and of comparable magnitude , indicating both robust ferroelectricity if switching could be achieved , and cooperativity between the two cation sites , which is a characteristic of good ferroelectric perovskites .",
    "shpanchenko and co - workers @xcite reported local spin density approximation ( lsda ) electronic structure calculations and an analysis of the bonding and magnetism .",
    "these calculations were based on the linearized muffin - tin orbital method with the atomic spheres approximation ( lmto - asa ) .",
    "this method is well suited to magnetic transition metal oxides , but is suffers from shape and basis set errors in open structures with highly non - cubic site symmetries , as is the case for pbvo@xmath0 .",
    "they also reported lsda+u calculations for ferromagnetic ordering only , with the augmented planewave plus local orbital ( apw+lo ) method .",
    "the comparison of these two leads to the conclusion that the formation of the spin polarized vanadyl bond depends on hubbard correlation effects .",
    "here we report lda calculations done with the general potential linearized augmented planewave ( lapw ) method , which incorporates the full crystal potential and has a much better basis set than the lmto - asa method , especially for the interstitial regions .",
    "@xcite we use these to discuss the formation of the electronic structure and the bonding of the compound .",
    "we find results that differ significantly from those of ref .",
    ", with a different conclusion regarding the vanadyl bond .",
    "our results compare well with very recent calculations of uratani and co - workers .",
    "@xcite we find an interplay between pb - o and v - o covalency that may be of importance for magnetoelectric materials .",
    "as mentioned , the calculations were done using the general potential lapw method . except",
    "as noted , the experimental 300k crystal structure reported by belik and co - workers @xcite was used .",
    "the calculated lsda forces on the atoms are small with this structure , supporting the experimental determination as well as the conclusion that the vanadyl bond is properly formed at the lsda level .",
    "the largest force is on the apical o of 0.032 ry/@xmath11 towards the v , with a smaller force of 0.017 ry/@xmath11 drawing the v towards the apical o for the lowest energy ( see below ) antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "the lapw sphere radii were 2.00 @xmath11 , 1.70 @xmath11 , and 1.35 @xmath11 , respectively for pb , v and o. local orbitals @xcite were used to treat the high lying valence states of pb and v , as well as to relax linearization errors .",
    "the basis sets consisted of approximately 1100 lapw functions plus local orbitals for the primitive cells and correspondingly larger sizes for supercells .",
    "zone sampling during the iterations to self - consistency was done using the special points method , with 40 * k*-points in the irreducible wedge for the primitive cell .",
    "tests with other choices were made .",
    "these showed that the calculations were well converged .",
    "magnetic ordering was studied using @xmath12 supercells . in all cases ,",
    "the core states were treated self - consistently and fully relativisically , while the valence states were calculated in a scalar relativistic approximation .",
    "stable spin moments of 1 @xmath13 were found for all magnetic configurations , consistent with local moment magnetism .",
    "this differs from the calculations reported in ref .",
    ", where the f ordering showed only a small moment in contrast to the c ordering . as mentioned , they also did lsda+u calculations for the ferromagnetic case , but with the apw+lo method instead of the lmto - asa method that they used for the other calculations in their paper .",
    "the implication of their results is that the hubbard u is essential for a stable spin polarized vanadyl bond .",
    "we find a stable spin polarized bond in accurate lsda calculations , with the implication that the key physics is hybridization with o and on - site hund s coupling .",
    "calculations were done for an artificial non - spin - polarized case , as well as ferromagnetic ( f ) , antiferromagnetic in the @xmath14 plane ( c ) , antiferromagnetic along all three directions ( g ) , and ferromagnetic @xmath14 planes stacked antiferromagnetically along the @xmath15-direction ( a ) .",
    "the calculated energies are given in table [ tab - e ] .",
    ".energetics of various spin configurations of pbvo@xmath0 relative to the non - spin - polarized case .",
    "energies are given in mev per formula unit . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab - e ]    we find the lowest energy state to be antiferromagnetic type c , qualitatively in agreement with the calculations of ref . , and with energies in good agreement with those of ref . .",
    "we note that the energies are not well described by a nearest neighbor heisenberg model .",
    "both the c and g orderings have antiferromagnetic @xmath14 planes but opposite stacking along @xmath15 . similarly , f and a have ferromagnetic @xmath14 planes , again differing in the @xmath15 stacking .",
    "however , the energies of c and g differ by less than 1 mev per v , while those of f and a differ by approximately 19 mev . thus interactions at least to second neighbor are needed to reconcile the energies . considering this , as well as the extremely small energy difference between the c and g orderings",
    ", the actual ground state could be complex .",
    "one may speculate that this is the reason for non - observation of antiferromagnetic superlattice peaks in neutron diffraction .",
    "we note that there is evidence for a transition at @xmath16120k seen both in thermal expansion @xcite and resistivity . @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the electronic structure , starting with the f ordering .",
    "the band structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ bands - f ] , and the corresponding density of states ( dos ) and projections in fig .",
    "[ dos - f ] .",
    "the band structure , in order of increasing energy , consists of a split - off pb @xmath17 derived peak , approximately 9 ev below the fermi energy followed by a manifold of o @xmath18 derived bands , and then , following another gap , a manifold of metal derived bands .",
    "initially , these are v @xmath2 derived , but at higher energy ( @xmath16 3 ev ) these change to include pb @xmath1 and other characters .",
    "0.3 cm 0.3 cm 0.3 cm    the crystal field may be regarded as a combination of an octahedral crystal field , which splits the @xmath2 levels into a lower lying @xmath19 group and a higher lying @xmath20 group .",
    "these are then further split by the off - centering .",
    "the main contribution to the crystal field in oxides is from metal - oxygen hybridization . since the o 2@xmath1 bands are below the v @xmath2 bands , the v @xmath2 orbitals are formally anti - bonding , so the the stronger the hybridization of a given @xmath2 orbital with o , the higher it will be pushed .",
    "the result is a splitting of the @xmath20 manifold into two and a splitting of the @xmath19 manifold into a low lying @xmath21 non - bonding band and a higher two - fold degenerate @xmath22 and @xmath23 derived manifold .",
    "this explains the multi - peak structure of the @xmath2 band dos . in the case of v@xmath6 ,",
    "there is one @xmath2 electron in the @xmath21 orbital , which forms local moments due to the hund s coupling .",
    "the exchange splitting for f ordering is 1.43 ev , and not sensitive to the magnetic ordering ( see fig .",
    "[ dos - qc ] ) .",
    "this is sufficient to fully polarize the @xmath2 orbitals . for f ordering this yields a half - metallic state , spin moment 1 @xmath13 .",
    "0.3 cm 0.3 cm 0.3 cm 0.3 cm    with the experimental structure of pbvo@xmath0 and f ordering , the crystal field splitting is almost , but not quite , sufficient to open a complete gap between the majority spin @xmath21 band and the higher lying @xmath2 bands .",
    "this is because of the bandwidth of the @xmath21 band . as may be seen in majority spin panel of fig .",
    "[ bands - f ] , the @xmath21 band has almost no dispersion along the @xmath24 line and has weak dispersion along @xmath25 implying that the main hopping is the @xmath14 plane .",
    "following the dispersion along @xmath26 , the @xmath21 band maximum is 0.3 ev above the bottom of the other @xmath2 bands .",
    "we did a structural relaxation for the f ordering .",
    "the resulting lsda positional parameters are @xmath27=0.5689 , @xmath28=0.2158 , and @xmath29=0.6872 , yielding a v - o1 bond length of 1.67  , which is slightly less than the experimental value",
    ". the corresponding experimental values are @xmath27=0.5668 , @xmath28=0.2102 , and @xmath29=0.6889 . the calculated full symmetry @xmath30 raman frequencies are 190 @xmath31 ( pb motion against the other atoms in the cell ) , 408 @xmath31 ( cations vs. o ) , and 838 @xmath32 ( v - o1 bond stretching , reflecting the short bond length and stiff interaction ) .",
    "the effect of in - plane antiferromagnetism is to narrow the @xmath21 band by disrupting nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "this is because the exchange spitting is large .",
    "the result is a band gap as shown in fig .",
    "[ dos - qc ] .",
    "because the crystal field splitting is sensitive to the exact v - apical o distance , the band gap should also be sensitive to this structural parameter .",
    "we can also understand in these terms why the energy difference between the g and c type orderings is small and that between the f and a type orderings is not , even though both pairs differ only in the @xmath15 direction magnetic stacking . specifically , in the f and a orderings , the majority @xmath21 manifold overlaps the other @xmath2 states so that the moment is not of pure @xmath21 character , and there are non - trivial dispersions in the @xmath15 direction in the region of the zone where there is overlap , such as @xmath25 of fig .",
    "[ bands - f ] .",
    "these dispersions provide interaction along @xmath15 , and because they consist of is metallic @xmath2 band overlap in only one spin channel , the resulting spin interaction is strongly ferromagnetic .",
    "thus f is strongly favored over a. on the other hand , with antiferromagnetic in - plane ordering , the @xmath2 bands are narrower , and so the @xmath21 band does not overlap the other @xmath2 states .",
    "thus the @xmath15 axis exchange coupling is much weaker . at the experimental structure",
    "it is very weakly ferromagnetic , favoring c over g , but if the gap were larger , either due to a shortening of the v - apical o distance or on - site coulomb repulsions , one would expect it to become antiferromagnetic . in this case , if the magnetic structure is simple , the ground state would become g type .",
    "thus , at least at the lsda level , pbvo@xmath0 is near a structure dependent cross - over between two magnetic states",
    ".    0.3 cm 0.3 cm",
    "turning now to the role of pb , the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ dos - f ] shows projections of the dos onto the pb lapw sphere ( radius 2 @xmath11 ) .",
    "the large peak below the o @xmath18 bands is from the pb @xmath17 states . as may be seen , these mix with the occupied o @xmath18 bands , but play almost no role in the unoccupied conduction bands .",
    "mixing of occupied states does not produce bonding . on the other hand ,",
    "the pb @xmath33 states are low lying in the conduction bands and mix with the o @xmath18 bands , which are the same bands that hybridize with v @xmath2 states .",
    "thus there is a mechanism for competition between the vanadyl bonding and the pb - o bonding .",
    "we emphasize that while the lone 6s pair of pb@xmath34 is often discussed in terms of the stereochemical activity of pb , these orbitals are not responsible for the activity directly .",
    "rather it is that in tl(i ) , pb(ii ) and bi(iii ) the atomic structure that leads to the position of the 6s orbital also leads to 6p levels that are low lying in the conduction bands and very spatially extended favoring hybridization with occupied ligand orbitals .",
    "we emphasize that while the lone 6s pair of pb@xmath34 is often discussed in terms of the stereochemical activity of pb , these orbitals are not responsible for this activity directly .",
    "rather it is that in pb(ii ) and bi(iii ) the atomic structure that leads to the position of the 6s orbital also leads to 6p levels that are low lying in the conduction bands and very spatially extended favoring hybridization with occupied ligand orbitals .",
    "0.3 cm 0.3 cm 0.3 cm    sr@xmath34 is similar in size to pb@xmath34 , but does not have the lone pair and the resulting low lying spatially extended unoccupied @xmath1 states . as a result , it would not form structures with short bond lengths to o like the reported structure of pbvo@xmath0 .",
    "ca@xmath34 is a smaller ion , also lacking the lone pair , and is more compatible with the bond lengths in pbvo@xmath0 , though , as mentioned , cavo@xmath0 actually forms a centrosymmetric tilted gdfeo@xmath0 type structure . as such ,",
    "we did calculations for hypothetical ferromagnetic ordered cavo@xmath0 with the atomic positions fixed at those of pbvo@xmath0 in order to elucidate the role of pb .",
    "the calculated dos is shown in fig .",
    "[ dos - cf ] . as may be seen , the pseudogap between the majority spin @xmath21 band and the remaining @xmath2 bands is reduced and the half - metallic character is lost ( the spin moment is 0.88 @xmath13 instead of 1 @xmath13 ) .",
    "as mentioned , in pbvo@xmath0 the calculated forces on the atoms are small . keeping the structure fixed ,",
    "there is a strong force of 0.08 ry/@xmath11 pushing the v away from the apical o , i.e. disrupting the vanadyl bond .",
    "thus indeed there is substantial coupling between the pb - o interaction and the v - o interaction , seen both in the stability of the vanadyl bond and the magnetic properties .",
    "this is due to bond competition with o. specifically , the removal of pb leads to broadening of the @xmath19 bands , which which spoils the crystal field scheme that stabilizes the vanadyl bond .",
    "to summarize , lsda calculations support the experimental conjecture that pbvo@xmath0 may be the basis for interesting magnetoelectric materials .",
    "this is based on the electronic coupling between pb and v due to mutual bonding with o and the stabilization of magnetism by a mechanism connected with the v - o bonding .",
    "the key challenge is to find chemical modifications that make the material more switchable , so that ferroelectricity can be observed .",
