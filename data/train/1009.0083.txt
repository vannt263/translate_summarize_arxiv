    "the description of the hydraulic jump arising from a jet striking a solid surface has been a rich source of fluid dynamical problems for decades . the first fairly complete description is usually attributed to  @xcite , and his theory has been refined and improved by many authors ( for example  @xcite ) .",
    "experimentally , there are several variants of the problem , such as where the jet strikes a horizontal plate at an oblique angle  @xcite , or where the plate is moving  @xcite .",
    "another important case involves the impact of a jet on a plane inclined with respect to the horizontal , so that there is now a gravitational force tangential to the plane . a profile resembling a parabola",
    "is then observed , with a maximum ` rise distance ' along the plane ( figure  [ fig : exp ] ) .",
    "this rise distance can be associated with the hydraulic jump in the purely horizontal case , although there are differences .    .",
    "the flow rate is  @xmath0 and the rise distance is @xmath1 . ]",
    "a full description of this problem is challenging , partly because of the breaking of axial symmetry , but also due to the necessarily complex flow in the thick ` rim ' bounding the inner , shallow region .",
    "for that reason , most existing models are based on inviscid fluid dynamics ( or the opposite extreme of stokes flow , as in  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite first described this situation in terms of the ballistic motion of fluid particles , leading to parabolic trajectories with a parabolic envelope or rim .",
    "such a ballistic model predicts a rise distance of order  @xmath2 , where  @xmath3 is the jet velocity and  @xmath4 the component of gravity along the plane . in this model",
    "the particle trajectories are characteristics of a geodesic equation modified by gravity  @xcite , and these characteristics cross .",
    "@xcite used a ` delta - shock ' model to resolve the crossing of characteristics , which lowers the rise distance to  @xmath5 of the ballistic value whilst maintaining a near - parabolic outer envelope .",
    "however , in their inviscid model the rise distance still scales in the same way as for the ballistic theory . in their paper @xcite",
    "performed one experiment ( at @xmath6 inclination angle ) and found a significantly lower value of the rise distance than their theory predicted ; they expressed hope that faster flow rates might capture the inviscid regime , but this has still to be verified .    in the present paper we account for the discrepancy using a viscous theory , motivated by observations made in a simple experiment .",
    "the theory is a straightforward modification of  @xcite , where the authors matched inner and outer solutions to viscous shallow - water equations to predict the radius of a circular hydraulic jump . to simplify the treatment ,",
    "we include a component of the gravitational force pointing towards the jet while maintaining the assumption of axial symmetry .",
    "the resulting equation correctly captures the dependence of the rise distance on both the jet velocity and inclination angle .",
    "the model , however , is not sufficient to address other features of the hydraulic jump , such as the shape of the envelope , or whether the jump closes or has an open ( i.e. , parabolic - like ) shape ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the model does not agree as well with experiments at slower rates of flow , as in  @xcite , or at angles of inclination larger than about  @xmath7 .",
    "we performed a simple experimental study on an inclined hydraulic jump to measure the dependence of the rise distance on flow rate and inclination angle .",
    "a large plexiglas sheet is held clamped over a sink at a constant angle , so that the water runs directly off at the edge .",
    "this sheet is painted white on one side and marked with a regular @xmath8 grid for length calibration .",
    "a small pump is used to supply fresh water at a constant flow rate @xmath9 , connected to a straight glass tube by flexible plastic tubing .",
    "the glass tube defines the nozzle of the jet , which has an inner diameter @xmath10 .",
    "it is fastened to a metal rod that can be adjusted so that the jet strikes the sheet at normal incidence for each value of  @xmath9 and inclination angle , while the nozzle itself is kept at a @xmath11 distance from the sheet .",
    "the flow rate was measured after each run by the time taken to fill a one liter beaker for each @xmath9 .",
    "based on this and the nozzle geometry we have an exit velocity @xmath12@xmath13 m / s , with reynolds number @xmath14@xmath15 .",
    "we inclined the plexiglas at five different angles @xmath16 , measured with respect to the horizontal : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath6 . at each angle",
    ", we varied the flow rate @xmath21@xmath22 . finally , from photographs we measured the rise distance  @xmath23 , which we define as the distance from the center of the jet to the position of the zenith of the hydraulic jump ( i.e. , the lower part of the rim or envelope at its point of highest rise ) . note that at higher @xmath9 and @xmath16 the flow becomes more unsteady , and the rise distance has larger error bars ( in those cases we average the rise distance over time ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : rise ] summarizes the results for the measured  @xmath23 , which increases with velocity and decreases with @xmath16 , as one would expect .",
    "we now present a simple theory to explain this dependence .",
    ", measured upslope from the center of the jet to the lower edge of the bounding rim .",
    "the solid lines come from the theoretical prediction  .",
    "the theory works well for moderate angles ( not near @xmath6 ) and faster jet speeds . ]",
    "to capture the maximum rise distance of the fluid along the sloping surface , we will model the flow as axisymmetric with a radial force , where the radial force arises from gravity along the slope angle .",
    "the radial model is suggested by the radial surface waves visible in figure  [ fig : exp ] , which appear roughly circular despite the inclination .",
    "this simplified model will prove sufficient to capture the scaling of  @xmath23 with jet velocity and inclination angle . to satisfy mass conservation",
    ", one can imagine truncating the surface just past the hydraulic jump , so that fluid can spill out .",
    "this model resembles a truncated inverted cone , with the jet hitting the apex , though without the geometrical factors associated with a cone .",
    "following  @xcite , we start with the steady , incompressible navier  stokes and mass conservation equations in axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates , in the boundary layer approximation :    @xmath24    [ eq : ns ]    where  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 are respectively the velocity components tangent and perpendicular to the solid surface , @xmath27 is gravitational acceleration , @xmath28 is the fluid thickness , and @xmath29 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the coordinate  @xmath30 is tangent to the solid surface , and  @xmath31 is perpendicular to it .",
    "the boundary conditions at the bottom and top of the fluid are    @xmath32    integrating equation   gives the mass conservation equation @xmath33 where  @xmath34 , with  @xmath9 the flow rate of the jet .",
    "in addition , we must specify the velocity  @xmath35 and height @xmath36 at a radius  @xmath37 larger than the jet radius , since the boundary layer equations are not valid directly under the jet .",
    "when  @xmath38 , equations   reduce to those of  @xcite .",
    "we use the standard hydraulic jump scalings to define dimensionless ` tilde ' variables :    @xmath39    [ eq : scalings ]    except that we included the  @xmath40 dependence in the scalings .",
    "( we will discuss the dimensionless constants  @xmath41 and  @xmath42 below . )",
    "we immediately drop the tildes .    in dimensionless variables ,",
    "the mass conservation equation   becomes @xmath43 upon averaging in the  @xmath31 direction , equation   becomes after integration by parts @xmath44 where the @xmath31-average of a function  @xmath45 is  @xmath46 , and we defined @xmath47    we now assume the separable form @xmath48 where  @xmath49 is the averaged profile , @xmath50 is a given function that describes the vertical structure of the thin layer , with  @xmath51 , @xmath52 . with this form for  @xmath53 ,",
    "the mass conservation integral   becomes simply  @xmath54 , which gives a relationship between  @xmath55 and  @xmath28 .",
    "this allows us to derive the two relations @xmath56 with @xmath57 the two relations   can be used in   and in the mass conservation integral   to obtain @xmath58 for  @xmath59 the equations   reduce to those of @xcite , which are essentially as derived by  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we combine   into one ode for  @xmath60 : @xmath61 which must be solved together with the flux boundary condtion  @xmath62 at the jet radius  @xmath37 .",
    "note that there is a singularity at  @xmath63 , and another at  @xmath64 .",
    "the former is not relevant , since we have  @xmath65 .",
    "the latter will determine the location of the hydraulic jump , which we will associate here with the rise distance .",
    "since  @xmath66 , this ode will have to be solved at each inclination angle and flow rate .",
    "when doing numerical calculations , we will use the parabolic profile @xmath67 from which equation   gives  @xmath68 , @xmath69 . a more general approach , for instance using a variable cubic profile as in  @xcite , does nt significantly change the scaling .",
    "let us examine solutions of   for typical experimental parameters .",
    "for the case shown in figure  [ fig : exp ] , @xmath0 and  @xmath70 .",
    "the viscosity of water is  @xmath71 and  @xmath72 .",
    "the jet radius is @xmath73 , and from the flow rate this gives a velocity  @xmath74 .",
    "inserting all this into  , we find a horizontal length scale  @xmath75 , velocity scale  @xmath76 , and  @xmath77 . in dimensionless form",
    ", we must now integrate   from  @xmath78 with  @xmath79 .",
    "( the @xmath80 arises from the choice of a parabolic vertical profile for  @xmath81 . )",
    "figure  [ fig : vodesol ] shows     and parameter  @xmath77 ( @xmath82 ) , corresponding to the values for figure  [ fig : exp ] in dimensionless form . for comparison ,",
    "the dashed line ( - - - - ) has  @xmath59 . both solutions become singular ( @xmath83 ) at  @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . ]    the numerical solution ( solid line ) , which becomes singular at  @xmath86 . in",
    "dimensional form , the singularity is  @xmath87 from the center of the jet .",
    "the experimentally - measured value for the lower edge of the hydraulic jump is  @xmath88 , with is  @xmath89 of the singularity position .",
    "note that these values are fairly insensitive to the exact jet radius  @xmath37 . for comparison ,",
    "the numerical solution for  @xmath59 is also indicated as a dashed line in the figure , with a singularity at a larger value of  @xmath30 .",
    "the singularity thus appears to occur somewhat beyond the actual position of the jump . to find the position of the jump , we would have to match to the ` outer ' solution ( small @xmath55 ) of  , and impose continuity of mass and momentum across the jump , as done in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite were left with an extra parameter  the location of a singularity of the outer solution  which they fixed by assuming the jet was striking a plate of finite extent , and then moving the singularity to the edge of the plate .",
    "we can not use this approach here : our hydraulic jump actually terminates , which by mass conservation means there must be either backflow or non - axisymmetric flow ( or both ) .",
    "both these effects require more powerful theories or the solution of more complex equations .    on the other hand ,",
    "since we are only after the scaling of the jump position , the theory we have is enough to uncover this scaling .",
    "@xcite observed that their jump location typically occurred at unit radius ( in dimensionless variables ) , somewhat independently of what was happening downstream in the outer solution .",
    "this suggests the following approach : fix the ratio of the jump distance to the singularity distance from the center of the jet . in our example above , that ratio was  @xmath89 , but we find @xmath90 fits the set of data slightly better .",
    "hence , we have in dimensional form  @xmath91 , or after using in  @xmath92 parabolic profile values for the numerical constant ,  @xmath93 : @xmath94 here  @xmath95 is obtained by solving the dimensionless ode   with initial condition at the jet radius  @xmath62 , and  @xmath96 is obtained from the dimensionless flow rate by  @xmath97 , where the  @xmath98 is for a parabolic vertical profile .    in figure",
    "[ fig : rise ] we compare formula   with experiments at various inclination angles , with the jet always striking the plane normally .",
    "we emphasize that the numerical prefactor in   is fixed , so we are not fitting each data set individually .",
    "the theory agrees well with experiments in both velocity and angle , except at low flow rates and at @xmath6 angle .",
    "the low flow rate disagreement is not troubling , since it falls outside the theory as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 theoretical curve stands out , since it is very close to the theoretical curve for @xmath20 .",
    "however , the trend of the @xmath6 curve with  @xmath9 is still captured .",
    "figure  [ fig : vsing ] shows the singularity position as a function of angle , for a fixed flow rate @xmath99 .    .",
    "the curve has a minimum around  @xmath100 . ]",
    "the curve actually has a minimum around  @xmath100 , which is unphysical : physically we expect the rise distance to decrease monotonically with angle , though at these large angles of inclination the flow is too unsteady for accurate measurement of the rise distance .",
    "we conclude that the theory breaks down for steeper angles : probably backflow becomes important , and the assumption that the the outer solution only weakly affects the jump position breaks down . according to figure  [ fig : vsing ] , the rise distance ceases to increase significantly after about  @xmath7 ; however figure  [ fig : rise ] shows a significantly higher rise distance for  @xmath6 inclination .",
    "this suggests that the present theory works well for angles  @xmath101 .",
    "we have presented simple experiments of the impact of a jet on an inclined plane , and noted the dependence of the maximum rise distance on both flow rate and angle .",
    "though a complete description of this problem is daunting , our simple radial model captures the dependence remarkably well , though less so at smaller flow rates and larger angles .",
    "a complete theory would , of course , describe the thickness of the bounding rim , but also predict the critical angle at which the hydraulic jump changes from closed to open @xcite . our simple model verifies the need to include viscosity to capture the rise height at these modest flow rates , as pointed out in  @xcite .",
