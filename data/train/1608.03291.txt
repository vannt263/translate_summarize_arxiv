    "cosmological data @xcite suggest that approximately 70% of the energy density in the universe is in the form of a negative - pressure component , called dark energy , with roughly 30% in the form of nonrelativistic matter ( including both baryons and dark matter )",
    ". the dark energy component can be parametrized by its equation of state parameter , @xmath4 , defined as the ratio of the dark energy pressure to its density : [ w ] w = p/. a cosmological constant , @xmath5 , corresponds to the case , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    while a model with a cosmological constant and cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) is consistent with current observations , there are many realistic models of the universe that have a dynamical equation of state . for example , one can consider quintessence models , with a time - dependent scalar field , @xmath8 , having potential @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "one of the first quintessence models to be investigated was the exponential potential , @xmath10 ( we work in units for which @xmath11 throughout ) .",
    "this potential arises naturally in the context of kaluza - klein theories , as well as in a variety of supergravity models ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "it was first explored in connection with inflation , where it produces a power - law expansion @xcite .",
    "later , this potential was examined as a possible model for quintessence @xcite .",
    "the exponential potential has the interesting property of generating tracking solutions , i.e. , for an appropriate choice of @xmath12 , the quintessence field evolves like radiation during the radiation - dominated era , and like matter during the matter - dominated era .",
    "this held the promise of resolving the coincidence problem , since the quintessence field can evolve as a relatively large and constant fraction of the matter density up to the present .",
    "however , it was soon realized that such models can not generate the observed accelerated expansion of the universe at late times , and they were largely abandoned .",
    "later , barreiro et al .",
    "@xcite attempted to resurrect the exponential quintessence model by introducing a scalar field with a potential given by a sum of exponentials . here",
    ", we investigate a simpler mechanism to allow the exponential potential to serve as a quintessence field : an exponential potential with a nonzero offset in the potential , so that : @xmath13 this model provides another example of  early dark energy , \" i.e. , dark energy that contributes significantly to the expansion rate at high redshift .    in the next section ,",
    "we explore the evolution of this scalar field , and show that it gives behavior consistent with an accelerating universe . in sec .",

    "the equation of motion for a scalar field , @xmath8 , in the expanding universe is [ eqmotion ] + 3h + = 0 , where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to time , and @xmath14 is the hubble parameter , given by [ hubble ] h^2 = ( ) ^2 = , where @xmath15 is the total density .",
    "we assume a spatially flat universe throughout .",
    "the scalar field energy density and pressure are given , respectively , by _",

    "( [ w ] ) .    in the standard cosmological model ( without quintessence ) , the density in eq .",
    "( [ hubble ] ) is dominated at early times by radiation , with a density scaling as _",
    "r = _ r0a^-4 , while at late times it is dominated by matter , with a density given by _",
    "m = _ m0a^-3 .    in general ,",
    "if the universe is dominated by a component with equation of state parameter , @xmath4 , then the density will scale as = _ 0 a^-3(1+w ) .",
    "we can therefore define a  background \" equation of state parameter , @xmath16 , which is given by @xmath17 during the radiation - dominated era , and @xmath18 during the matter - dominated era .",
    "now consider the evolution of @xmath8 for the exponential potential given by eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) . for this case ,",
    "( [ eqmotion ] ) has no analytic solution .",
    "however , it is possible to show that there is an  attractor \" toward which the solution evolves . for [ limit ] ^2 > 3(1+w_b ) , this attractor is characterized by an equation of state w_= w_b , and a density , relative to the total density , of [ omegaphi ] _ = .",

    "@xcite , it is possible to derive an approximate analytic prediction of the evolution of @xmath8 in this case . at early times , the exponential term in the potential dominates , so we have tracking behavior , with the field evolving like radiation during the radiation - dominated era , and like matter during the matter - dominated era . at late times",
    ", the @xmath25 term begins to become important . to estimate the evolution in this case",
    ", we can represent the scalar field as the sum of a constant - density part ( with potential @xmath25 ) and a new field , @xmath26 , which evolves in the pure exponential potential given by eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) .",
    "in essence , our model is identical to a quintessence field with a purely exponential potential evolving in a @xmath5cdm background .",

    "the result is that @xmath31 scales first like matter , and then like a cosmological constant , but the evolution is not identical to simply adding an additional dark matter component at early times and a cosmological constant at late times . in our model",

    "since we are interested in the late - time evolution relevant for quintessence , we do not include the radiation component .",

    "observational data place strong constraints on models with significant early dark energy , like the one presented here . prior to precision",
    "cmb experiments , the best limits came from upper bounds on the energy density during big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "however , these limits have been superseded by constraints from the cmb , so the cmb constraints are the limits we will use here .",
    "we first note that while the density of the quintessence field evolves as radiation during the radiation - dominated era , and as matter during the matter - dominated era , its clustering behavior is not identical to either radiation or matter during these epochs .",
    "the reason is that scalar fields are characterized by a sound speed of @xmath43 .",
    "in contrast , cold dark matter has @xmath44 and radiation has @xmath45 .",
    "this difference is most noticeable during the matter - dominated era . because of its large sound speed , the scalar field does not cluster ,",
    "so even a small admixture of the scalar field can produce a distinct imprint on the cmb .",
    "cmb limits on additional energy density have been discussed , e.g. , by calabrese et al .",

    "@xcite , and hojjati et al . @xcite .",
    "the most useful limits for our purposes come from hojjati et al .",

    "they parametrize the change in the expansion rate from an additional component in terms of a parameter @xmath46 , defined by h(a)^2 = [ 1 + ( a ) ] , where @xmath47 is the energy density in the standard @xmath5cdm model .    in either the matter - dominated or radiation - dominated eras , the relation between @xmath2 in our model and @xmath46 in ref .",

    "@xcite are @xmath51 the tightest constraints on @xmath46 occur at the lowest redshift , ( largest @xmath36 ) examined in ref .",
    "@xcite : at @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the @xmath44 case , for which the additional component can simply be absorbed into the definition of the cold dark matter density , such that the tightest constraints come from the radiation - dominated era .",
    "taking @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ lamblimit ] ) gives @xmath3 .",
    "thus , the regions in parameter space above the solid curves in figs . 1 and 2 are ruled out . in terms of @xmath2 , this bound translates into : @xmath54    while the quintessence field does not behave exactly like extra radiation during the radiation - dominated era ( because it has @xmath43 rather than @xmath55 ) , it is nonetheless instructive to see what energy density our limit corresponds to in the radiation era in terms of the effective number of additional neutrinos . in the radiation - dominated era ,",
    "the number of additional neutrinos is related to @xmath2 as @xcite @xmath56 then our limit in eq .",
    "( [ ombound ] ) corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "subject to this bound , our model produces a small positive value of @xmath58 during big bang nucleosynthesis .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "1 that our modified exponential potential can provide a plausible model for the accelerated expansion of the universe , with an evolution for @xmath1 that differs from that of @xmath5cdm .",
    "however , it predicts an evolution for @xmath4 that diverges only slightly from standard @xmath5cdm . for the observational bound @xmath3 , the value of the equation of state parameter at a redshift of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) is @xmath61 , which then declines toward @xmath24 at present . in the terminology of caldwell and linder @xcite , these are  freezing \" models .",
    "while it will be very difficult to distinguish these models from @xmath5cdm using , e.g. , supernova determinations of the cosmic equation of state , these models , rather unusually for quintessence , will actually be more strongly constrained ( or confirmed ) with improved cmb data . as noted in the previous section , a large region of parameter space",
    "is already ruled out by the planck and wmap9 data , so additional cmb data will either drive the allowed valued of @xmath12 to such a large number that the model becomes essentially indistinguishable from @xmath5cdm , or else show anomalies due to additional energy density at early times .    now consider the issue of the coincidence problem , which was one of the original motivations for introducing quintessence with an exponential potential in the first place .",
    "does our modified model provide an amelioration for the cosmic coincidence ?",
    "the coincidence problem can be stated in two different ways .",
    "one is the fact that the dark energy density is of the same order of magnititude as the matter density today : @xmath62 .",
    "this is odd because the matter density scales as @xmath63 , while a dark energy component derived from , e.g. , a cosmological constant has a constant energy density .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath64 at early times , and @xmath65 in the far future , and therefore it is peculiar to find that @xmath62 today .",
    "this leads to a second statement of the coincidence problem : the  why now ? \"",
    "issue . why do we happen to live at a special epoch when the dark energy density is beginning to dominate the expansion ?    our model does , to some extent ,",
    "ameliorate the coincidence problem when it is expressed in terms of energy densities . at early times",
    ", the quintessence density tracks the radiation and matter densities , such that from the early universe up to the present , the quintessence energy density can be a nonnegligible fraction ( @xmath66 ) of the background radiation or matter density , rather than being many orders of magnitude smaller . on the other hand ,",
    "the model does nothing to answer the question of  why now ? \" the model parameters must still be tuned so that the @xmath25 term in eq .",
    "( [ expmod ] ) begins to dominate the @xmath67 term at around the present day .",
    "perhaps the most interesting result is that this model shows that these two ways of expressing the coincidence problem may not be , as is usually assumed , entirely equivalent .",
    "it is possible to construct a model ( i.e. , this one ) for which the densities of the dark energy and matter are not widely separated over much of the early universe , but which still retains the need for us to live in a",
