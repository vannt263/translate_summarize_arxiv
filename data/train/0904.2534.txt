    "the lhc is turning on later this year and the exploration of the tev scale will commence soon thereafter .",
    "one of the cleanest signals for new physics that may be discovered early on is the existence of a @xmath0-like resonance in the drell - yan channel .",
    "such resonance structures , with a wide variety of possible identities , are predicted to exist in a large number of extensions to the standard model(sm)@xcite . presently , for states with typical electroweak strength couplings to sm fields , current constraints from the tevatron restrict their masses to lie above @xmath2 tev@xcite .",
    "once large integrated luminosities of order @xmath3 fb@xmath4 are obtained at the lhc , these new resonances should be visible for masses as large as @xmath5 tev depending on the specific details of the model . the only way to directly access states with larger masses at the lhc is to significantly increase the integrated luminosity into the few ab@xmath4 range as might be expected at the slhc upgrade .",
    "eventually , however , these direct searches will run out of steam resulting in a limited mass reach .",
    "is there any way to see beyond this direct search reach at the lhc ?",
    "it is well - known that future @xmath6 colliders operating in the tev energy range can indirectly probe for new @xmath0 resonances by exploring contact interaction - like deviations from the cross sections and asymmetries predicted by the sm@xcite in various final state channels .",
    "for the typical luminosities that are often discussed for these colliders , @xmath7 ab@xmath4 , and making use of electron and positron beam polarizations , the masses of @xmath0-like states as large as @xmath8 may be explored in this way . if these new resonance states are not too heavy it may also be possible to extract the corresponding resonance mass itself ( _ without _ prior knowledge from the lhc ) using @xmath6 data collected at several different center of mass energies@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it seems more than likely that such colliders will not become available until at least the end of the 2020 s . in the meantime",
    "we might wonder if the mass reach of the ( s)lhc itself could be extended in any similar way .",
    "in this paper we will explore the possibility of indirectly observing the effects of such @xmath0-like states which are too massive to be seen directly as resonances at the the lhc , somewhat in analogy with what is done at @xmath6 colliders , employing data taken over a range of dilepton masses .",
    "clearly such an analysis is only applicable to resonances with couplings to the sm fermions which are of electroweak strength or larger .",
    "we note in passing that lighter drell - yan resonance states with very small couplings , perhaps missed by the tevatron , will be difficult if not impossible to observe indirectly at the lhc and so will not be a subject for discussion here .    to some extent , if we are exploring dilepton invariant masses _ far _ below the new resonance",
    ", one might imagine that much of this indirect search information could be extracted directly from the more conventional contact - interaction studies at the lhc@xcite and this is indeed the case to some extent .",
    "however , in the more interesting ( and , perhaps , more likely ) case that we will consider here , the mass of the resonance is not too far above the @xmath9 discovery reach of the lhc so that non - interference terms as well as the finite resonance width effects also become important thus warranting a separate study .",
    "in addition to this , we note that traditional contact - interaction analyses are usually restricted to ( combinations of ) the familiar chiral , dimension-6 , four - fermion operators introduced long ago@xcite and do not allow for the possibility of other spin combinations that we must in all generality consider below .",
    "given the rather wide selection of possible models with drell - yan resonances having electroweak strength couplings to the sm fermions , we will employ four sample benchmark examples in the analysis that follows : ( @xmath10 ) a conventional @xmath0 with electroweak couplings . here",
    "we will employ the specific @xmath0 of the sequential sm ( ssm ) which is a standard candle for experimenters ; in this case the @xmath0 is simply the sm @xmath1 but with a significantly larger mass .",
    "other , more realistic , @xmath0 states with couplings of comparable magnitude will yield very similar results since this example captures the essential properties of this class of spin-1 models .",
    "( @xmath11 ) a randall - sundrum(rs)@xcite graviton with the sm fields localized to the tev brane ; to be specific we will assume that @xmath12 as a typical value for purposes of demonstration .",
    "alternative values of this parameter will , of course , modify the signal rate we would obtain .",
    "this model allows us to examine the case of a spin-2 resonance which corresponds to a dimension-8 four - fermion interaction far below the ( first ) graviton mass .",
    "of course the complete graviton kaluza - klein(kk ) spectrum must be included in such an analysis ; here for practical reasons we will sum over the first dozen kk states which provide the dominant contributions to the scattering amplitude in the dilepton mass range of interest at and below the first resonance peak .",
    "similarly , ( @xmath13 ) we consider an @xmath14parity violating sneutrino , @xmath15 , which we choose for simplicity to have identical electromagnetic strength lepton number violating couplings@xcite to both quarks and leptons as a typical example of a spin-0 resonance .",
    "other choices would lead to modifications in the predicted rates below .",
    "it is important to remember that in this spin-0 case there is no interference with the usual sm exchanges .",
    "similarly , in the kk graviton spin-2 case above , the interference with the sm exchanges also vanishes when one integrates over the full angular range .",
    "finally , we consider ( @xmath16 ) the case of simultaneous , tev - scale , kaluza - klein excitations of both the photon and @xmath1 with the sm fermions being 4-d@xcite fields localized at the origin of the fifth dimension . in this case",
    "each of the resonances have the same couplings as do their sm counterparts except for a rescaling by a factor of @xmath17 due to the normalization of their bulk wavefunctions .",
    "this is a very special situation due to the well - known , but somewhat unusual , destructive interference that takes place between the sm ( @xmath18 ) and full set of kk exchange amplitudes@xcite which causes a drastic reduction in the cross section with dilepton invariant masses near @xmath19 that of the first kk resonances .   yet below the kk mass so that the sm and kk amplitudes have nearly identical structure but opposite signs , the kks being just heavy copies of the sm states .",
    "this destructive interference is difficult to duplicate in other model scenarios even if multiple exchanges were present since a very fine tuning of couplings would be required . ] as in the rs graviton kk case , in practical calculations we will sum over the first dozen resonance states whose contributions will dominate in the dilepton mass region of interest .",
    "we note that these are only benchmark models ; in some cases , , that of the r - parity violating sneutrino , the overall coupling strength has been chosen to make the resonance ` interesting ' in the mass range we are studying .    to be specific in the analysis that follows , we will only consider the lhc with @xmath20 tev and with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath4 .",
    "however , the results that we obtain can be straightforwardly translated to other effective values of @xmath21 and integrated luminosity .",
    "furthermore , the cteq6.6 pdfs@xcite will be employed throughout the analysis below in obtaining all of our numerical results as will the usual mass - scale - dependent nlo / nnlo k - factors@xcite whose typical value is @xmath22 in the mass range of interest . the first step in our analysis is to approximately determine the usual @xmath9 direct discovery reach for the resonances in the benchmark set .",
    "this can be easily done by examining and extending the results from the detector collaborations themselves@xcite .",
    "once these values are determined , we will consider the corresponding resonances with somewhat larger masses .",
    "an example of this reach for conventional @xmath0 models is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] as a function of the 14 tev lhc integrated luminosity .",
    "here we have assumed an approximate @xmath23 lepton i d efficiency in this and in all figures to follow .",
    "note that a detector smearing of @xmath24 , similar to that of atlas for electrons and cms for muons in this mass range , has been included and , although no @xmath25 cut is applied , the final state leptons are required to be central , , with a pair rapidity @xmath26 in all cases .",
    "we will employ this cut in all cases below except where as otherwise noted ; these results are found to match very closely those quoted by both experimental collaborations . here we see that in the ssm @xmath0 model case the lhc discovery reach is @xmath27 tev assuming a luminosity of 300 fb@xmath4 . in a similar fashion ,",
    "updating the estimates from our various earlier analyses , we can ascertain the @xmath9 discovery reaches for the other benchmark models described above .",
    "conservatively , we find values of @xmath28 tev for the lightest rs graviton@xcite , @xmath29 tev@xcite for the @xmath30-parity violating @xmath15 and @xmath31 tev@xcite for the first photon-@xmath1 gauge kk states , respectively .",
    "resonance discovery reach for conventional @xmath0 states at the 14 tev lhc as a function of the integrated luminosity in the dilepton channel .",
    "the red(green , blue , magenta , cyan ) curves correspond to the @xmath32(@xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) model cases , respectively.,width=321 ]    what observables are available to search for new resonances indirectly at the lhc ?",
    "there are essentially two : the dilepton invariant mass distribution , @xmath37 , itself and the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath38 , which is determined by the dilepton angular distribution . here",
    "we focus on @xmath38 instead of the angular distribution itself since , as we will see , there are already significant statistical issues that we must face . conventionally ,",
    "the scattering angle for the @xmath39 process is defined in the center - of - mass frame ( where the leptons are back - to - back ) to be that between the incoming quark and the outgoing negatively charged lepton . at the lhc",
    "this quantity can not be directly measured since we do not know from which proton the quark came@xcite . however , this problem can be somewhat circumvented as quarks generally carry more momentum in the proton than do anti - quarks and thus the direction of motion , , boost , of the dilepton system in the lab frame is more likely to be that of the incoming quark .",
    "since this approach can sometimes incorrectly assign the quark direction , the resulting raw asymmetry is diluted and this must be corrected for in the analysis via monte carlo@xcite .",
    "( we will assume that this can be done correctly and with high efficiency in all cases in our discussion below ) .",
    "correspondingly , this approach requires us to place a lower bound on the rapidity of the outgoing leptons in high mass events in order to define forward and backward hemispheres to obtain @xmath38 .",
    "here one traditionally requires@xcite that the lepton pair rapidity @xmath40 which removes very central events in the detector , but also results in reduced statistics thus increasing the corresponding error on the value of @xmath38 .",
    "this is actually a more serious issue than one may initially imagine as a further problem with @xmath38 develops for the case of the very high mass dilepton pairs that we are considering : the collider kinematics leads to an upper limit on the lepton pair rapidity ( in addition to the usual experimental cut of @xmath41 ) given by the expression found in ref.@xcite : @xmath42 note that in the drell - yan process the fractional momenta of the initial state partons , which must satisfy @xmath43 , are given@xcite by @xmath44 ; requiring that @xmath45 immediately leads to the constraint equation above .",
    "thus , ever larger values of @xmath46 for fixed @xmath21 force the final state leptons to be more and more central . since here @xmath20 tev",
    ", taking @xmath47 tev as will be relevant below , leads to the constraint @xmath48 , respectively . since we are simultaneously requiring that @xmath40 to obtain a reasonably undiluted @xmath38 in the first place it is clear that the available phase space is very rapidly shrinking at high masses leading to rather poor available statistics . as we will see below",
    ", this implies that @xmath38 will not play a major role in indirect high mass resonance searches at the lhc even if we allow for a somewhat softer lower cut on the lepton rapidity .",
    "let us begin our analysis by considering the invariant mass distribution for drell - yan produced dileptons , @xmath37 . a straightforward calculation including k - factors , efficiencies , experimental cuts and approximate detector smearing as discussed above but _ neglecting _ the effect of bin - to - bin @xmath49 statistical fluctuations ( associated with the limited number of events in each bin and causing the apparent ` up and down ' bin to bin changes in the plot ) leads to the results shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "here we see several things : first , this figure verifies to some extent our previous estimates of the @xmath9 search reaches for the set of benchmark models that we are considering .",
    "second , for the cases where the resonances are near or above the direct search reach , we can easily observe in some cases what appear to be deviations from the sm predictions for the @xmath37 distribution in the dilepton mass range from @xmath50 tev , somewhat below the resonance masses themselves .",
    "if these deviations were statistically significant ( neglecting for the moment any discussion of systematic errors arising from , , pdf uncertainties and electroweak corrections ) by fitting the shape of this deviation to a model - dependent excitation curve we would obtain a smoking gun for the existence of a new resonance as well as a possible estimate of its mass .",
    "it is important to remember that in obtaining these results we have assumed the coupling parameters as described above .",
    "the fact that , , the sneutrino is more easily visible than is the rs graviton is merely due to the choices of couplings we have made above for the assumed values of the resonance masses under study for the different models .",
    "what we have shown by this analysis is that , in the absence of statistical fluctuations , some resonances will produce visible deviations in the dilepton mass distribution from the sm expectations in the region below the resonance mass .",
    "as we will now show , these fluctuations lead to a ` washing - out ' of this effect rendering indirect observation essentially impossible .",

    "[ fig2 ] where the statistical fluctuations are now explicitly included . here",
    "we can still observe ( at the @xmath9 level in comparison to the sm background ) resonances themselves ( at the corresponding mass reach values quoted above ) but the statistical fluctuations in the data below the resonance peak now make all of the distributions look rather similar .",
    "a careful analysis does show some sensitivity to the higher mass resonances ( which are quite close to being observable directly ) in the case of kk gauge excitations as these have a very special associated signature due to the strong destructive interference in this mass range as discussed above@xcite . even with the statistical fluctuations present it is possible to observe that the prediction for the gauge kk case lies systematically _ below _ that of the sm .",
    "one could argue that this bad situation with respect to the statistical fluctuations masking any significant effect might be improved by increasing the width of the dilepton mass bins to increase statistics and decrease the effects of fluctuations . in this case , however , we only gain in statistics at the price of reduced sensitivity as can be seen by the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig25 ] , where the bin sizes are now increased by a relative factor of 5 , with similar results found to hold in other rescaling cases .",
    "it thus seems quite unlikely that new resonances can be indirectly observed at the lhc except in exceptional circumstances where they have large effects on data in the dilepton mass range far below the resonance mass itself .",

    "such distributions certainly have added statistical power as well as increased sensitivity to the high mass region of interest to us and are not sensitive to bin - size effects .",
    "examples of these types of distributions using our benchmark models for both sets of assumed masses are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the top panel ,",
    "all of the benchmark models are clearly seen above the sm background as would be expected from our earlier discussion . in the lower panel , the 5 tev sneutrino and",
    "the 6 tev gauge kk benchmarks may possibly lie significantly above the sm background while the other benchmarks appear to lie much lower . for comparison purposes",
    "the case of a 6 tev sneutrino is also shown and the corresponding histogram is seen to lie quite close to the sm background expectations . in order to make a direct comparison of the benchmark models , consider , for example , the cumulative number of expected events we find above a dilepton mass of 4 tev ( subject to very large statistical fluctuations as well as possibly significant systematic uncertainties ) is 1.0(1.8 , 1.4 , 3.9 , 7.2 , 1.7 ) for the sm(6 tev ssm , 5 tev rs graviton , 6 tev gauge kk , 5 tev sneutrino and 6 tev sneutrino ) cases , respectively , none of which remotely rises close to the level of a significant signal@xcite except possibly for the case of the 5 tev sneutrino .",
    "clearly the cumulative distributions do not show any obvious evidence for sensitivity to new resonances beyond the direct lhc discovery reach even when potentially important systematic effects are neglected .",
    "this implies that except in exceptional circumstances new resonances can not be indirectly detected using this method .     but now showing the _ cumulative _ number of events above a minimum value of the dilepton invariant mass . in the lower panel",

    "this can be most easily seen by examining the results presented in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] which shows ( without errors ) the expected values of @xmath38 in the dilepton mass range of interest for the sm as well as for the ssm and gauge kk models for several different values of the resonance masses . clearly @xmath38 deviates significantly from the sm expectations in the region below the mass of the new resonance in all cases .",
    "however , as we will see , the statistical power of @xmath38 in this same mass range is quite poor . to demonstrate the importance of a cut of @xmath52 on the available statistics we note that in the lowest dilepton mass bin considered here , near @xmath53 tev , we find 248 events in the sm case before applying this rapidity cut but only 105(155 ) events afterwards . in this mass bin , these cuts yield the asymmetry values of @xmath54 which show that the ( statistical only ) errors are already quite large . above this dilepton mass",
    "the severity of the lower rapidity cut becomes far more significant and the size of the error on the asymmetry grows quite rapidly .",

    ", however , we can easily imagine that if the mass of the new resonance were significantly less , @xmath56 tev say , it would be possible that @xmath38 measurements below the peak would provide significant sensitivity to new physics .",

    "clearly such sensitivity will be dependent upon the specific nature of this new resonance and the precise lower bound on the rapidity applied to the final state leptons .",
    "however , scanning over the various benchmark models and possible resonance masses we find that the total contribution to the @xmath59 from the deviation in the value of @xmath38 to be always less than @xmath60 and generally far smaller .",
    "this is not too surprising given the results shown in fig .",
    "thus it is quite clear that the additional information obtained from the dilepton angular distribution will not be very helpful in indirect searches for new resonances in the dilepton mass range of interest to us here above 4 - 5 tev .",
    "thus we conclude that such searches must essentially rely on the dilepton mass distribution except in very special circumstances .",
    "in this paper we have explored the possibility of indirectly discovering resonance states in the drell - yan channel at the lhc for particles of various spins when their masses are just beyond the direct discovery reach .",
    "generally , we find this task to be quite difficult if not impossible even in the limit where systematic effects , such as pdf uncertainties , are neglected .",
    "the only exception to this result is the rather unusual circumstance of nearly degenerate photon and @xmath1 kaluza - klein excitations .",
    "in particular , in the course of this analysis , we found that the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath38 , of the dilepton pair was generally not a useful observable for performing such searches due to the large associated statistical errors in the mass range of interest above @xmath61 tev . essentially , these indirect searches must rely solely on the dilepton mass distribution .",
    "except for possibly the special gauge kk case , where significantly modifications are observed in the dilepton invariant mass distribution at masses far below the peak due to strong interference with sm exchanges , new resonances are found to only perturb the mass distribution significantly in the neighborhood just below the peak itself where the statistics are commonly quite poor .",
    "hopefully new drell - yan resonances will be relatively light and will soon be discovered at the lhc",

    "the author would also like to thank j.l .",

    "<S> we explore the possibility of indirectly observing the effects of @xmath0-like particles with electroweak strength couplings in the drell - yan channel at the lhc with masses above the resonance direct search reach . </S>",

    "<S> not unexpectedly , the one possible exception to this general result is the case of degenerate kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the photon and @xmath1 that occur in some extra - dimensional models . in this special case </S>",
    "<S> , the strong destructive interference with the standard model ( sm ) exchanges below the resonance mass leads to a well - known significant suppression of the cross section and thus increased sensitivity to this particular new physics scenario .    </S>",
