    "this is the second of two papers concerning how to modify a next - to - leading order ( nlo ) calculation in quantum chromodynamics by adding parton showers in such a way that when the generated events are used to calculate an infrared safe observable , the observable is calculated correctly at next - to - leading order . in the companion paper @xcite , krmer and the present author",
    "explain the aspects of this problem that relate to the divergences that appear in perturbation theory when two massless partons become collinear .",
    "this part of the method is quite simple and easy to understand .",
    "the treatment of the divergences that appear when a gluon becomes soft is a bit more technical and will be given in this paper .",
    "we find that it it is conceptually simplest to match showers to a nlo calculation if the nlo calculation is performed in the coulomb gauge .",
    "that is because the collinear divergences of the theory in a physical gauge like the coulomb gauge are isolated in the cut and virtual self - energy diagrams  just the diagrams that you would draw to illustrate a parton splitting to two partons .",
    "accordingly , the present research program was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows how to do nlo calculations in the coulomb gauge .",
    "i should point out that , although there is a certain conceptual simplicity that emerges through the use of a physical gauge , one can use any gauge , as the recent work of frixione , nason , and webber on the same subject demonstrates @xcite .",
    "i begin with a brief restatement of the problem .",
    "consider the calculation of an experimental observable that describes a hard scattering process involving strongly interacting particles and suppose that the chosen observable is infrared safe , which makes a perturbative calculation for the observable sensible .",
    "the simplest sort of calculation for this purpose consists of calculating the hard process cross section at the lowest order in @xmath1 , call it @xmath2 , at which it occurs .",
    "however , one often performs a next - to - leading order calculation , including terms proportional to @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "then the estimated error from yet higher order terms ( which are usually unknown ) is typically smaller than with a leading order calculation .",
    "the nlo calculations are typically in the form of computer programs that act as monte carlo generators of partonic events .",
    "they produce simulated events with final states @xmath4 consisting of a few partons with specified momenta .",
    "for example , for three - jet production in electron - positron annihilation , there are three or four partons in the final state .",
    "each event comes with a weight @xmath5 .",
    "then the predicted value for an observable described by a measurement function @xmath6 is @xmath7 a serious weakness of most current nlo monte carlo generators is that they produce simulated final states that are not close to physical final states .",
    "this contrasts sharply with the highly successful leading order monte carlo event generators such as pythia , herwig , and ariadne @xcite , which do generate realistic final states . what could be done to generate realistic final states in an nlo calculation ?",
    "one might think of using the three and four parton final states in the nlo partonic generators to generate a parton shower from each outgoing parton .",
    "this gives a final state with lots of partons .",
    "then one could use one of the leading order monte carlo event generators to turn the many partons into hadrons .",
    "there should not be a serious problem with the hadronization stage , since this is modelled as a long distance process that leaves infrared safe observables largely unchanged .",
    "the problem lies with the parton showers . here",
    "a high energy parton splits into two daughter partons , which each split into two more partons .",
    "as this process continues , the virtualities of successive pairs of daughter partons gets smaller and smaller , representing splittings that happen at larger and larger distance scales .",
    "the late splittings leave infrared safe observables largely unchanged",
    ". however , the first splittings in a parton shower can involve large virtualities .",
    "they represent a mixture of long distance and short distance physics .",
    "thus one must be careful that the showering does not reproduce some piece of short distance physics that was already included in the nlo calculation . to be a little more precise ,",
    "if one expands the prediction of the calculation including showers in a power series in @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the hard process scale , in the form @xmath10 then our goal is to insure that the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 are exactly the same in the calculation with showers as in the purely perturbative nlo calculation .",
    "the algorithms that we propose apply to showers from final state massless partons .",
    "they are illustrated using the process @xmath13 in quantum chromodynamics .",
    "but not @xmath14 .",
    "thus the present calculation is to be applied with a measurement function that give zero for events that are close to the two - jet configuration .",
    "] while our research program was underway , frixione and webber succeeded in matching showers to a nlo calculation for a problem with massless partons in the initial state ( but no observed colored partons in the final state ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently , frixione , webber , and nason have extended this method to a problem with massive colored partons in the final state @xcite .",
    "their method is similar to the method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , or more precisely to a variant of that method in which the first level of parton splitting , based on coulomb gauge splitting functions in ref .",
    "@xcite , is instead based on the splitting functions of herwig .",
    "the soft gluon effects treated in this paper are not part of the algorithms of @xcite . instead , these references employ what amounts to a soft gluon cutoff .",
    "above is then modified by an amount proportional to a positive power of the cutoff parameter @xmath15 , so as long as @xmath15 is chosen small enough , the cutoff effects in @xcite are negligible .",
    "] there has been other work on this problem @xcite .",
    "that of collins @xcite is particularly instructive .",
    "in this section , i describe the particular problem left over from ref .  @xcite that remains to be addressed in this paper , recalling just enough of the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite to set up the issue .",
    "consider one of the born graphs for @xmath16 .",
    "three partons emerge into the final state .",
    "the idea presented in ref .",
    "@xcite is to let each of these partons split into a pair of partons , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : shower1 ] .",
    "two features of the splitting are important .",
    "first , when the virtuality @xmath17 of the pair is small , the splitting probability is proportional to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the share of the momentum carried by one of the daughter partons and @xmath20 is the appropriate altarelli - parisi splitting function .",
    "second , the collinear singularity at @xmath21 is damped by a sudakov factor with the behavior @xmath22 for @xmath21 .",
    "thus each of the three partons makes a jet , but in the limit of small @xmath1 , each jet is usually very narrow and appears in an infrared safe measurement like a single massless parton .",
    "there is a qualifying adverb `` usually '' here .",
    "a fraction @xmath1 of the time , one of the splittings has a substantial virtuality and we get a four - jet final state .",
    "thus there is an order @xmath3 effect in which some probability is removed from the three - jet final state and given to a four - jet final state . in a purely nlo calculation ,",
    "this effect is included in the @xmath3 graphs .",
    "thus , to keep the calculation correct to nlo , we subtract these probabilities from the @xmath3 perturbative graphs .",
    "the subtractions are required for nlo consistency of the calculation , but they have another important effect . since the splitting functions have just the structure found in the order @xmath3 graphs in the collinear limit , the subtractions cancel the collinear singularities ( and the collinear @xmath23 soft singularities ) of the order @xmath3 graphs .",
    "the real and virtual singularities are separately cancelled , whereas without the subtractions the real and virtual singularities are left to cancel against each other ( which , of course , they do ) . if there were no other singularities , we could let the three and four parton final states of the order @xmath3 graphs develop into parton showers , which would affect the result of the calculation only at order @xmath24",
    ". the calculation would be numerically stable because the integrals for the three and four parton states would be separately finite .",
    "but , of course , there are other singularities , namely the singularities from emission of soft gluons at wide angles from the three hard partons , as well as the corresponding singularities in the @xmath3 virtual graphs .",
    "these singularities cancel between the order @xmath3 graphs with three and four final state partons , but we can not let these two kinds of final states develop separately into showers without losing this cancellation and thus encountering numerical instability .",
    "this is not just a technical problem to be somehow sidestepped .",
    "the emission of a soft gluon at order @xmath3 is a real physical effect .",
    "it is an effect that does not fit a picture of separate evolution of the three jets because the soft gluon is sensitive to the whole final state .",
    "that is , the probability to emit a soft gluon does not break up into the sum of three independent probabilities , one for emission from each jet .",
    "there is a natural way to deal with this .",
    "we can consider the three jets to form an antenna that radiates a soft gluon .",
    "the radiation probability is proportional to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the energy of the gluon , @xmath27 are its angles , and @xmath28 is a function that is determined by the directions of the three jets .",
    "we can account for the normalization of the radiation probability provided by the virtual graphs by providing a suppression factor with the behavior @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : shower2 ] . thus a soft gluon is always emitted , but when @xmath1 is small the gluon is usually too soft to matter to an infrared safe measurement .",
    "however , a fraction @xmath1 of the time the gluon can have a substantial energy and we get a four - jet final state .",
    "thus there is an order @xmath3 effect in which some probability is removed from the three - jet final state and given to a four - jet final state . in the purely nlo calculation , this effect is included in the @xmath3 graphs .",
    "thus , to keep the calculation correct to nlo , we subtract these probabilities from the @xmath3 perturbative graphs .",
    "of course , the required subtraction terms will be just the soft singularity subtractions that we needed to stabilize the @xmath3 contributions if we add showers separately to @xmath3 graphs with three and four - jet final states .",
    "does the necessity to add soft radiation from a three - jet antenna mean that the standard parton shower monte carlo programs such as herwig , pythia , and ariadne need to be rewritten in order to be compatible with an nlo calculation ?",
    "not at all .",
    "we do not need soft radiation with its correct angular dependence at every stage of a parton shower .",
    "all that we need is to radiate one soft gluon from the hard event with its correct angular dependence .",
    "this radiation , along with the initial splittings of the three hard partons , can be considered to be part of the nlo calculation , so that the monte carlo programs do not need any modification at all .",
    "i will add more comments on this subject in the conclusions section of this paper .",
    "@xcite , we saw that one can turn `` @xmath31 $ ] '' into `` @xmath32 '' with respect to self - energy graphs , which contain the collinear and @xmath33 singularities in the coulomb gauge . in this section ,",
    "we begin a detailed description of the singularities generated by the emission of soft gluons at wide angles to the outgoing partons . up to now in our description , these singularities cancel between real and virtual emissions in the form `` @xmath34 $ ] . '' in the following sections , we turn this into the form `` @xmath35 '' together with some left over nonsingular terms .",
    "consider a cut born graph in which the final state has a quark ( momentum @xmath36 ) , a gluon ( momentum @xmath37 ) and an antiquark ( momentum @xmath38 ) .",
    "these partons will make collinear showers , but we ignore that for now .",
    "what concerns us here is that these outgoing partons act as an antenna that radiates soft gluons . let a soft gluon with momentum @xmath39 be emitted by parton @xmath40 and , in the complex conjugate amplitude , absorbed by parton @xmath41",
    "we need to specify the kinematics in a definite way .",
    "we choose to route the momenta for the @xmath42 term so that the momenta @xmath43 carried by , respectively , the quark , the gluon , and the antiquark in the final state are given by @xmath44 thus for a graph with @xmath45 , the momentum @xmath46 before the soft gluon emission is @xmath47 and afterwards it is @xmath48 . for a graph with @xmath49 , the momentum",
    "@xmath46 before the soft gluon emission is @xmath50 and afterwards it is @xmath51 .",
    "we now specify the approximation to be applied for the soft gluon emission @xcite .",
    "let a parton with momentum @xmath46 emit a soft gluon with momentum @xmath39 and enter the final state with momentum @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 .",
    "the momenta @xmath52 and @xmath46 are approximately in the direction of a light - like vector @xmath54 .",

    "the approximation is based on the fact that the soft gluon sees a current @xmath60 that is approximately proportional to @xmath61 .",
    "thus if we denote the polarization vector of the gluon by @xmath62 , we can replace @xmath63 this replacement becomes exact in the limit in which @xmath60 approaches @xmath64 for some constant @xmath65 .",
    "it is important the the momentum @xmath39 not point along @xmath54 .",
    "that is , the gluon momentum should be small so that both @xmath46 and @xmath52 and thus @xmath66 are approximately proportional to @xmath54 , but the gluon momentum should not be collinear with the momentum of the emitting parton .    for the graph in which the soft gluon goes from parton @xmath40 to parton @xmath41 , the factors @xmath67 , together with appropriate color matrices , give a factor ( in the coulomb gauge ) @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the coulomb gauge numerator factor @xmath70 , % \\ ] ] where @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "the constants @xmath73 are the color factors for this process , @xmath74 what about the factor @xmath75 ? in the case of emission from a quark , we have ( since @xmath76 ) @xmath77 so we simply include a factor @xmath78 for the final state quark .",

    "specifically , there would be an advantage when calculating three - jet observables close to the two - jet region .",
    "for example , consider the thrust distribution near to @xmath260 .",
    "the two - jet calculation with showers , before any merging , would approximately sum terms proportional to @xmath266 , generating these terms by showering from the two - jet hard process . for @xmath267",
    ", the merged calculation should contain the @xmath246 and @xmath243 contributions correctly , including of course the term proportional to @xmath268 .",
    "it should also include the terms @xmath269 for @xmath270 generated by showering from a two - jet configuration .",
    "the three - jet algorithm presented in this paper does not include merging with a two - jet calculation and thus does not generate these logarithms .",
    "thus the present program , when applied to the thrust distribution , should not be used for small values of @xmath262 .",
    "second , it is desirable to add not only parton showers but hadronization to nlo perturbative calculations . for hadronization , one can use an existing model @xcite .",
    "however , most hadronization models require color information on the final state partons .",
    "since the current code does not assign a color structure to these partons , it will be necessary to add this capability .",
    "third , in principle , hadronization models should be infrared safe in the sense that final partonic states that differ by a parton splitting into two almost collinear partons ( or one parton and another with almost zero momentum ) will produce almost the same hadronic final state . since hadronization models currently in use do not necessarily have this property ,",
    "the nlo calculation should provide it by combining parton pairs with virtuality less than some cutoff parameter matched to the hadronization model to be used .",
    "finally , the current paper includes hardly any numerical investigations to check how well the program works for various observables and how the results depend on parameters such as the renormalization scale @xmath271 and the soft gluon limiting energy @xmath272 .",
    "addressing these needs remains a topic for future research .",
    "in this paper and @xcite , we have seen how to add parton showers to a next - to - leading order calculation in qcd in such a way that the result obtained for an infrared safe observable remains correct to next - to - leading order .",
    "the main feature of this procedure is to turn the collinear singularities of the order @xmath3 graphs into the primary parton splittings , that is the first splittings of the partons that emerge from an @xmath213 graph .",
    "this was accomplished in @xcite in a particularly simple fashion by virtue of the fact that ref .",
    "@xcite is based on a nlo calculation in the coulomb gauge . in this gauge",
    "the collinear and collinear @xmath23 soft singularities are entirely contained in the cut self - energy graphs .",
    "thus we simply eliminate the small - virtuality part of cut self - energy subgraphs in @xmath3 graphs and instead incorporate these contributions into the primary parton splittings from the corresponding @xmath213 graph .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the next step , and the main subject of this paper , is to treat the soft , wide angle singularities of the theory .",
    "again , we subtract terms with these singularities from the @xmath3 graphs and then incorporate them as radiation from the @xmath213 graphs . here , the hard partons emerging from an @xmath213 scattering form an antenna that radiates the soft gluon . the gluon is radiated coherently from the antenna and is not part of any jet .",
    "this gives an algorithm that can be viewed as a simulation of the production of three hard partons ( for the three - jet process considered in this paper ) and one soft gluon , with each of the three hard partons splitting into two daughter partons .",
    "the six daughter partons and one soft gluon then serve as the progenitors of parton showers according to the simple algorithm used in ref .",
    "@xcite or any standard algorithm .",
    "there remains the remnants of the order @xmath3 graphs , with three and four parton final states .",
    "each of these final state partons serves as the progenitor of whatever sort of parton shower is desired .",
    "the results of this paper suggest a strategy for building future nlo calculations matched to parton showers .",
    "the matching concerns the primary parton splittings , that is the first splittings of the partons emerging from a born graph .",
    "the matching also needs the radiation of a soft gluon from the antenna formed by partons emerging from the born graph .",
    "this suggests that the author of an nlo calculation might build in the primary parton splittings and the soft gluon radiation .",
    "there are also secondary splittings .",
    "these are the splittings from the soft gluon produced from a born graph , the splittings of the daughters produced by the primary splittings , the splittings of the partons from an order @xmath3 graph , and , finally , the further splittings of all of these partons as a complete parton shower is formed .",
    "the secondary splittings do not need to be matched to the nlo calculation .",
    "that is , the soft gluon and the partons after the primary splittings and the partons produced by the @xmath3 graphs can be fed to any shower and hadronization algorithm as long as it is infrared safe .",
    "the result is that for a given process such as @xmath16 we can have @xmath273 next - to - leading order calculations and @xmath274 shower and hadronization calculations and we do not need @xmath275 matching schemes as long as each nlo calculation includes its primary parton splittings and treatment of soft gluon radiation .",
    "this does not preclude debate over how best to do the primary parton splitting and soft gluon radiation .",
    "this paper and ref .",
    "@xcite have , of necessity , chosen one scheme , but that scheme may well be less than optimal .    the code described in this paper is available at @xcite .    the author is pleased to thank his collaborator on ref .",
    "@xcite , michael krmer , for his advice .",

    "we have seen that in order to calculate the contribution to @xmath135 from an order @xmath243 graph with a virtual loop , we should calculate a difference integral of the form @xmath276 where @xmath66 is @xmath277 or @xmath242 and @xmath278 and @xmath279 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ fijl ] ) and ( [ fijr ] ) . in this appendix , we consider @xmath280 , that is a virtual loop to the left of the final state cut .",
    "the integrand for the original graph is represented here by the function @xmath4 .",
    "the momenta @xmath116 are the momenta of the final state partons , while @xmath104 is the momentum in the virtual loop .",
    "there are either one or two terms in the sum over the indices @xmath42 , depending on the graph .",
    "the term @xmath42 is included if there is a potentially soft virtual gluon connecting final state lines @xmath40 and @xmath41 in @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath281 be that combination of @xmath104 and the @xmath282 that is carried by this potentially soft virtual line in @xmath4 .",
    "for example if the final state propagators 1 and 2 are connected by a gluon line that carries momentum @xmath39 in the virtual loop and propagators 2 and 3 are also connected by a virtual gluon line that carries momentum @xmath283 , then @xmath284 and @xmath285 . in the virtual subtraction term",
    ", we call the integration variable @xmath286 . if we identify @xmath287 with @xmath281 , the @xmath110 subtraction term matches @xmath4 when @xmath288 , so that the leading singularity is cancelled .",
    "the method used in this paper is to perform the virtual loop integrations numerically , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus we must make sure that this cancellation works numerically .",
    "first , we define the dependence of @xmath4 and @xmath242 on @xmath289 to be the dependence computed from the relevant feynman graphs with the final state momenta @xmath290 on - shell : @xmath291 . of course ,",
    "in our present discussion , the @xmath292 are the momenta of on - shell massless partons , so evidently @xmath291 . however , at a later stage in the calculation each of these partons will generate a parton shower with the same @xmath57 . even with a shower , we take the functions @xmath4 and @xmath242 to remain unchanged .",
    "this is in contrast to our treatment of showering from the born graphs and is required for the nlo graphs in order to preserve the soft gluon cancellations .",
    "next , in the integral of the full graph @xmath4 , the integration is deformed into complex loop - momentum space , @xmath293 the imaginary part of the deformed loop momentum is a definite function @xmath294 of the real part .",
    "the jacobian @xmath295 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath296 . by deforming the contour",
    ", we avoid the singularity of the form @xmath297 in @xmath4 , the @xmath42 _ scattering singularity_. it is , however , not allowed to deform the contour away from the soft singularity at @xmath298 .",
    "for that reason @xmath299 is proportional to @xmath300 as @xmath301 .",
    "hence we come very near to the scattering singularity when @xmath281 is small .    what about the subtraction term ? here",
    "there is a singularity of the form @xmath302 we may call this the _ approximate scattering singularity_. we note that @xmath303 for @xmath288 , so the singularity ( [ approxsoftsing ] ) is indeed an approximation to eq .  ( [ softsing ] ) if we identify @xmath286 with @xmath281 . as in the @xmath4 integral",
    ", we need to deform the contour to avoid the singularity ( [ approxsoftsing ] ) . as in the @xmath4 integral",
    ", the deformation will have to vanish as we approach the soft singularity at @xmath304 . in order for the cancellation between the full graph and the soft gluon subtraction to work , we need to be careful about the matching of the singularities in the two integrands .",
    "we are now in a position to state the matching problem more precisely .",
    "we define complex vectors @xmath305 , one for each potentially soft gluon line @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ softsubtraction ] ) .",
    "each @xmath305 is a function of the corresponding @xmath306 that is asymptotically equal to @xmath306 when @xmath306 is small .",
    "then we write the integral in eq .",
    "( [ softsubtraction ] ) in the form @xmath307 the jacobian @xmath308 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath309 .",
    "our goal will be to specify the functions @xmath305 so that we avoid the approximate scattering singularity in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ softsubtraction2 ] ) and so that the @xmath310 singularities in the sum of the two terms cancel sufficiently well that the integral is convergent .",
    "we immediately recognize a small problem .",
    "the soft singularity ( with @xmath311 ) lies on an ellipse , while the approximate soft singularity lies on a plane . to make them match at the required accuracy ,",
    "we define @xmath312 where @xmath313 and @xmath314 are certain functions of @xmath315 to be defined below and @xmath316 is the maximum value of @xmath317 in the soft gluon subtraction , eq .",
    "( [ softrealfull ] ) .    the idea is to have the soft subtraction cancel the leading singular behavior of @xmath4 point by point in @xmath104 . to do this",
    ", we need to match the singularity @xmath318 in @xmath4 with the singularity @xmath319 in @xmath110 .",
    "there are three parts in the relation ( [ sijstart ] ) between @xmath320 and @xmath281 .",
    "there is a real displacement @xmath321 , a contour deformation @xmath314 in the imaginary direction , and a factor @xmath322 .",
    "the factor @xmath323 serves to set the deformation to zero at the edge of the integration region and needs no further discussion .",
    "we choose the real displacement to be @xmath324 } \\left\\ { [ 1 - ( \\hat l_{ij}\\cdot \\hat q_j)^2]\\ , \\vec q_i - [ 1 - ( \\hat l_{ij}\\cdot \\hat q_i)^2]\\ , \\vec q_j \\right\\}. \\label{xidef } % \\ ] ] this choice is motivated by carrying out the expansion ( [ approxsoftsing ] ) to one more order . then one finds that @xmath325 the imaginary displacement is @xmath326 here @xmath327 is a parameter with dimensions of inverse momentum .",
    "this function matches the function @xmath299 in the limit of small @xmath104 as long as one chooses @xmath327 to be the same parameter as is used in @xmath299.$ ] , where @xmath328 and @xmath329 are the parameters used to define the deformation in . ]",
    "thus @xmath330 there are other singularities that have to match .",
    "first , both @xmath4 and the soft subtraction terms have @xmath331 soft singularities that evidently match since @xmath332 to lowest order .",
    "second , both terms have collinear singularities along the lines @xmath333 and @xmath334 .",
    "these are pinch singularities : it is not allowed to deform the contours to avoid them .",
    "for this reason @xmath335 vanishes when @xmath212 is in the same direction as @xmath336 or @xmath337 .",
    "furthermore , the part of @xmath321 that is not proportional to @xmath116 vanishes when @xmath104 is in the same direction as @xmath336 and the part of @xmath321 that is not proportional to @xmath337 vanishes when @xmath104 is in the same direction as @xmath337 .",
    "we are now ready for the second stage of our construction . in the first stage",
    ", we concentrated on the @xmath288 region .",
    "the function @xmath338 given in eq .",
    "( [ sijstart ] ) works fine for small @xmath315 .",
    "however , our integration region ends at @xmath339 , so we supplied a factor that turns the contour deformation off at the boundary of the integration region .",
    "unfortunately , the singularity at @xmath340 intersects the surface @xmath341 .",
    "thus we should retain some contour deformation even at the boundary @xmath341 of the integration region .",
    "this is simple to do .",
    "let us consider the problem anew , this time ignoring the special problems at @xmath231 that were addressed in the analysis above .",
    "let @xmath342 and write @xmath315 in spherical polar coordinates @xmath343 based on @xmath344 as the @xmath345 axis .",
    "then we have an integral @xmath346 where @xmath347 , that is @xmath348 the integrand has a singularity of the form @xmath349 .",
    "all that we need to do is deform the contour for the @xmath19-integral away from the singularity .",
    "there are collinear singularities at @xmath350 and @xmath351 , that is at @xmath352 and @xmath353 , where @xmath354 the contour can not be moved at the collinear singularities .",
    "thus we can take @xmath355 where @xmath356 the factor @xmath357 is included here simply to turn this deformation off for small @xmath358 , since we already have a method for dealing with the small @xmath358 region . in a coordinate frame",
    "independent notation , this is @xmath359 with @xmath360 where @xmath361 now we have two methods for moving the integration contour , each of which works in its region and turns off in the region of the other method .",
    "all that we have to do is to add the two deformations , @xmath362 this is the final prescription , with @xmath321 given in eq .",
