    ", we have the freedom to control the optimization area .",
    "a further advantage of our study is that there is no significant surface reflections since there is an index match between the sample substrate and the immersion oil .      in order to optimize multiple speckle spots , we used the partitioning algorithm , which is described in ref .",

    "we obtained a maximum enhancement of 257@xmath4 for an optimization radius of about 0.3@xmath11 m , which corresponds to one speckle spot .",
    "as the optimization radius increases , @xmath20 decreases drastically down to 2@xmath4 at the largest radius @xmath37 15.2@xmath38 m , which corresponds to 1716 open transmission channels . in ref .",

    "[ fig : eta_target ] , we show a nonlinear least squares fit to the experimental data using eq .  [ eq : eta ] and @xmath40 is the only adjustable parameter .",
    "weighing all data points equally , the fit agrees well with the first two optimization radii @xmath14 = 0.3@xmath11 m and 1@xmath34 m that have 1 and 7 transmission channels respectively .",
    "strikingly , the fit deviates from the experimental data by about a factor of 2 at large radii .",
    "this deviation signifies that there is more intensity available in the optimization channels , than that predicted according to eq .",
    "[ eq : eta ] , especially at large radii .",
    "we discuss three possible reasons for the deviation of the theory from the experimental data .",
    "first , it is known that noise has a significant effect on the single - speckle optimization  @xcite .",
    "our wavefront shaping experiments are in the regime where shot noise is much higher than the camera and laser noise that are about 1@xmath19 and 2@xmath19 respectively . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in this shot noise regime the enhancement of a single - speckle optimization is expected to scale linearly with the total intensity in the optimization area @xmath41 . extending this model to the optimization of multiple channels , we derive @xmath42 where @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a pre - factor in the relationship @xmath45 .",
    "a constant enhancement with radius obviously does not describe our experimental data , hence we reject this hypothesis .",
    "second , the observed increased enhancement might be due to intensity redistributed from the speckles outside the optimized area to speckles inside the optimized area .",
    "if this is the case , then the total transmitted intensity would be constant for all optimization radii .",
    "a third hypothesis is that there is a redistribution of intensity from the reflected speckles to the transmitted speckles . in this case",
    ", the effect of enhancing the transmitted intensity is expected to be noticeable on reflection as a reduction of the reflected intensity .",
    "we will check these later two hypotheses in the next section .",
    "the enhancements of the total transmitted intensity @xmath46 , the total reflected intensity @xmath47 , and the intensity outside the optimization area @xmath48 versus the optimization radius are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_total ] .",
    "the enhancement of the total transmitted intensity gradually increases from about 1.1 to 2 at the largest radius of 15.2@xmath11 m , which is close to the @xmath49 m large size of the detected speckle pattern .",
    "there is also an enhancement of the intensity outside the optimization area and it is about @xmath50 at large radii . the enhancements of both the total transmitted intensity and the intensity of area outside the optimization nullifies the second hypothesis .",
    "in contrast to the transmitted intensity , the enhancement of the total reflected intensity slowly decreases to @xmath51 as the optimization radius increases .",
    "the decrease of the @xmath47 is not as rapid as the increase of @xmath52 because the reflected intensity is about nine times higher than the transmitted intensity .",
    "therefore , a large intensity enhancement on transmission corresponds to a small intensity enhancement on reflection .    in order to accurately compare the decrease of @xmath47 with the increase of @xmath52",
    ", we need to know the dependence of both terms on the optimization radius .",
    "the dependence of the enhancements on the optimization radius is unknown and we find that a power - law @xmath53 describes the experimental data well . here ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 are adjustable parameters .",
    "the fits to the experimental data are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_total ] and the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 obtained from the fits are shown in table  [ table : table1 ] .",

    "[ fig : intensitychange ] , we plot the absolute changes in the transmitted and the reflected intensities after accounting for the attenuation factor of the nd filters .",
    "the absolute changes in the transmitted and reflected intensities both collapse to the same curve , modeled with @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of the transmitted intensity corresponds to a decrease in the reflected intensity .",
    "this validates the third hypothesis that there is a redistribution of intensity from the reflection speckles to the transmission speckles of the scattering medium .      at this point ,",
    "the question arises : how does the reflected intensity change spatially ? is the change global , _",
    "i.e. , _ does the overall reflected intensity decrease uniformly , or local , _",
    "i.e. , _ does the intensity decrease more in the area where the transmission is enhanced ? as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] , a global change of the reflected intensity implies that the intensity redistributed to transmission is deducted equally from all the spatial channels .",
    "this is expected if all input spatial channels contribute equally to all the output spatial channels . on the other hand",
    ", a local change implies that the intensity of the spatial input channels maps one - to - one with that of output spatial channels .",
    "the local change is expected as a result of the reflection - transmission long - range correlation predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to observe the type of change , we plot the radial distribution of the reflected intensity in figs .  [",
    "fig : reflintensityring ] ( a ) and ( b ) for optimization radii of 15.2@xmath11 m and 8.4@xmath11 m respectively . in both optimization radii ,",
    "the optimized ( red circles ) and unoptimized ( blue squares ) intensities matches quite well from @xmath59 to about @xmath60 5@xmath11 m .",
    "the optimized intensity deviates asymmetrically from the unoptimized intensity between @xmath60 5@xmath11 m and 10@xmath11 m . at @xmath61 m ,",
    "both intensities become equal and decrease in the same way .    for a proper interpretation of these results ,",
    "we describe the global and local change in the reflected intensity as follows .",
    "first , we model the unoptimized reflected intensity @xmath62 with a 2d circular gaussian function @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is the amplitude , @xmath65 is the spatial coordinate , @xmath66 is the coordinate of the center , and @xmath67 is the standard deviation that defines the width of the function . in order to model both the global and local change , we define a second 2d circular gaussian function @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the displacement of the center of @xmath68 from @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively and @xmath73 is the standard deviation of @xmath68 .",
    "we model the optimized intensity @xmath74 , in the case of the global change , as the difference between @xmath62 and @xmath68 , when @xmath75 and @xmath76 , to get    i_g ( ) & = ( - ( ) ) + & - ( - ( ) ) .",
    "[ eq : i_global ]    to model the optimized intensity @xmath77 , in case of a local change , we use the difference between @xmath62 and @xmath68 , when @xmath78 and @xmath76 , to get    i_l ( ) & = ( - ( ) ) + & - ( - ( ) ) .",
    "[ eq : i_local ]    using eqs .  [ eq : unoptimized ] , [ eq : i_global ] and [ eq : i_local ] , 2d gaussian functions were calculated for unoptimized light , and optimized light for either global or local changes , respectively .",
    "a projection of the generated functions onto the x - axis is shown in the bottom left and right insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] . following the same procedure for the analysis of the experimental data , we obtain the radial distribution of the calculated functions by integrating the intensity along the circumference of a ring of width of @xmath35 and inner radius of @xmath36 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : reflintensityring ] ( c ) and ( d ) , we plot the calculated intensity versus radius for both the global and local change . to obtain the curves in figs .",
    "[ fig : reflintensityring ] ( c ) and ( d ) , we used these parameters : @xmath79 m , as obtained by fitting a gaussian function to the unoptimized reflected intensity ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "for both global and local changes , the values of @xmath64 and @xmath82 are chosen such that the ratio of the total area under the calculated optimized and unoptimized functions is 0.95 , which corresponds to a comparable enhancement on reflection in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta_total ] . both @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "were chosen to be 45.5@xmath34 m , which is exactly at the center of the generated 2d gaussian function .",
    "the adjustable parameters are @xmath83 m , and @xmath84 m and we will comment on these values in the next paragraph . for the global change shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : reflintensityring ] ( c ) , there is a symmetric deviation of the reflected intensity from the unoptimized light and the deviation is centered at the peak position near @xmath85 m . at radial positions between @xmath59 and @xmath86 m and @xmath87",
    "m and @xmath88 m , optimized light matches with unoptimized light .",
    "these features of the calculated global change do not correspond with the features of the experimental data shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : reflintensityring ] ( a ) and ( b ) . for the local change shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reflintensityring ] ( d ) , there is interestingly an asymmetric deviation of the optimized light from the unoptimized light between @xmath89 m and @xmath90 m .",
    "this asymmetric deviation is very similar to what is observed for the two optimization radii in figs .",
    "[ fig : reflintensityring ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "our experiment results therefore indicate that there is a local change in the reflected intensity rather than a global change .",
    "we now comment on the values of the adjustable parameters . in the experiment , @xmath91 m and @xmath92 m and we have used @xmath93 m in figs .  [ fig : reflintensityring ] ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , in order to have a similar asymmetric deviation in the local change .",
    "it should be noted that the global change is almost independent of @xmath94 , since @xmath95 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : i_global ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the experiment values of ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) and the adjusted values might be the result of the thermal drift of the slm , laser , mechanical stage onto which the sample is mounted and other apparatuses . from the experimental and adjusted values of ( @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) , we estimate that the beam is displaced by approximately @xmath85 m , which is conceivable since the measurements took several days .",
    "consequently , due to the beam displacement of @xmath98 m , the optimization area mapped onto the reflection light is almost outside the reflected intensity , which has @xmath99 m .",
    "therefore , the large optimization radii on the transmission side does not have a significant effect on the reflection side .",
    "this explains why @xmath83 m , rather than @xmath100 m and @xmath101 m , shows in fig .",
    "[ fig : reflintensityring ] a feature that is comparable to the feature from the experiment . despite these imperfections in the experiment",
    ", our data qualitatively shows that there is a local change in the optimized intensity .",
    "we have experimentally shown that as the optimization radius increases , the enhancement of the total transmitted intensity increases , while simultaneously the total reflected intensity decreases .",
    "we also find that the enhancement of the intensity outside the optimization area increases as the optimization radius increases . from the radial intensity distribution of the reflected intensity",
    ", we find evidence that there is a local decrease in the reflected intensity rather than a global decrease .",
    "the local decrease confirms that the transmitted and reflected intensities are spatially correlated as recently predicted by fayard _",
    "et al _  @xcite .",
    "our results have prospects in extending the applications of wavefront shaping to increase the total transmitted intensity through the rough layer on top of the silicon absorber in a solar cell .",
    "our results are also interesting for multi - channel quantum secure communication  @xcite , where enhanced intensities are desired in multiple transmission channels ; for transmitting arbitrary intensity distribution through a scattering medium  @xcite ; and imaging through an opaque medium  .",
    "for the optimization of intensity in large areas , we investigated three different wavefront shaping algorithms : the stepwise sequential algorithm , the partitioning , and the genetic algorithms . the details on how these algorithms work are described in refs .",
    "firstly , the sequential algorithm modulates the phase of the segments of the slm one by one and combines them at the end of optimization .",
    "secondly , the partitioning algorithm modulates the phase of 50@xmath19 of the segments simultaneously and keeps the optimized phases on the slm .",
    "the modulated segments are chosen randomly at each step",
    ". a better performance of the partitioning algorithm is expected because a larger number of segments is controlled simultaneously , and this is expected to yield a significant change in the target signal compared to the sequential algorithm .",
    "thirdly , the genetic algorithm begins by creating a population of random phase masks , which are ranked using the measured enhancement .",
    "the phase masks are combined using a weight proportional to the enhancement and then further mutated to create new phase masks .",
    "the new phase masks are measured and replace the low ranking members of the population . as the whole steps are repeated",
    ", the average enhancement of the population increases and finally converges .",
    "we have performed wavefront shaping experiments to compare the enhancement of the three algorithms . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ch07_comparealgorithms ] , we plot the enhancement @xmath20 in the optimization area versus the optimization radius @xmath14",
    ". the enhancement decreases with increasing radius for all algorithms , as is expected . with the partitioning algorithm ,",
    "the enhancement is on average approximately @xmath102 higher than for the sequential algorithm .",
    "the partitioning algorithm outperforms the sequential algorithm because of the larger modulation signal in the optimization area .",
    "furthermore , the partitioning algorithm has an enhancement that is @xmath103 higher than for the genetic algorithm .",
    "we expected a similar performance of the genetic algorithm and the partitioning algorithm , since a comparable number of segments is simultaneously controlled in the two algorithms .",
    "we attribute the lower performance to the fact that the genetic algorithm requires a large number of experimental parameters , which might differ for different optimization radii . a further detailed study of using genetic algorithm for large areas optimization is needed .",
