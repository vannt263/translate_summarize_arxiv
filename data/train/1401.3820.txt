    "many - body entanglement is essential to the existence of topological order in strongly correlated systems .",
    "while ground states in topologically trivial phases can take a simple product form , ground states in topological phases are always entangled .",
    "of course , ground states in topologically trivial phases can be entangled , too .",
    "it is then natural to ask what is the essential difference between the entanglement patterns that give rise to topologically trivial and nontrivial states .    besides topological entanglement entropy @xcite and the entanglement spectrum @xcite , which partially capture the topological properties of the system , quantum circuits @xcite",
    "provide a powerful tool for characterizing the entanglement patterns of topological states .",
    "intuitively , one would expect that states with more complicated entanglement patterns require larger circuits to generate from product states .",
    "also , small circuits would suffice to connect ground states in the same phase as their entanglement patterns are similar , while large circuits are necessary to map states from one phase to another .",
    "indeed , in gapped quantum many - body systems it has been shown that two ground states are in the same topological phase if and only if they can be mapped to each other with a local quantum circuit of constant depth , i.e. , a constant ( in the system size ) number of layers of nonoverlapping local unitaries @xcite . states with nontrivial intrinsic topological order are thus said to be long - range entangled in the sense that they can not be created from product states with circuits of constant depth .",
    "circuits of constant depth can generate symmetry protected topological ( spt ) states from product states but only if the symmetry is broken .",
    "if only symmetric unitaries are allowed , the circuit depth has to grow with the system size .    therefore , topological states are in this sense more entangled than topologically trivial states , but how entangled are they ?",
    "in particular , we ask , what is the quantum circuit complexity of generating topological states from product states , i.e. , how does the circuit depth scale with the system size ? in two and higher dimensions , it has been shown that circuits of linear ( in the diameter of the system ) depth are necessary to generate states with topological degeneracy @xcite .",
    "one might expect that topological states without topological degeneracy are less entangled and can be created with circuits of sublinear depth .",
    "however , we show that this is not the case , at least in one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "we demonstrate that , _ to generate 1d gapped ( symmetry protected ) topological states from product states , the depth of the ( symmetric ) local quantum circuits has to grow linearly with the system size . _",
    "the majorana chain @xcite provides an example of a topological state without topological degeneracy , and we show that local fermionic circuits of linear depth are necessary for its creation . for all 1d spt states , we show that linear depth is required as long as the symmetry is preserved . in particular ,",
    "we prove that the nonlocal ( string ) order parameters @xcite distinguishing different spt phases remain invariant under symmetric circuits of sublinear depth .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly construct circuits of linear depth that generate 1d topological states .",
