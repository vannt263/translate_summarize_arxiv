    "the problem of motion of planets in general relativity , considered as test particles moving along geodesic lines in the metric of schwarzschild s solution , has been solved in an approximate way by einstein @xcite , who found that the perihelion advance during one revolution is given in the near - keplerian limit by the formula @xmath0 where @xmath1 is newton s gravitational constant , @xmath2 the mass of the central body , @xmath3 the greater half - axis of planet s orbit and @xmath4 its eccentricity .",
    "this formula is deduced from the exact solution of the general relativistic problem of motion of a test particle in the field of schwarzschild metric , which leads to the expression of the angular variable @xmath5 as an elliptic integral , which is then evaluated after expansion of the integrand in terms of powers of the small quantity @xmath6 .",
    "the formula has been successfully confronted with observation , giving excellent fits not only for the orbits with small eccentricities ( e.g. , one of the highest values of @xmath4 displayed by the orbit of mercury , is @xmath7 ) , but also in the case when @xmath4 is very high , as for the asteroid icarus ( @xmath8 ) , and represents one of the best confirmations of einstein s theory of gravitation . in the case of small eccentricities",
    "the formula ( [ advance1 ] ) can be developed into a power series : @xmath9 one can note at this point that even for the case of planet mercury , the series truncated at the second term , i.e. , taking into account only the factor @xmath10 will lead to the result that differs only by @xmath11 from the result predicted by relation ( [ advance1 ] ) , which is below the actual error bar.this is why we think it is useful to present an alternative way of treating this problem , which is based on the use of geodesic deviation equations of first and higher orders . instead of developing the exact formulae of motion in terms of powers of the parameter @xmath6 , we propose to start with an exact solution of a particularly simple form ( i.e. a circular orbit with uniform angular velocity ) , and then generate the approximate solutions as geodesics being close to this orbit .",
    "one of the advantages of this method is the fact that it amounts to treating consecutively systems of linear equations with constant coefficients , all of them being of harmonic oscillator type , eventually with an extra right - hand side being a known periodic function of the proper time .",
    "the approximate solution obtained in this manner has the form of a fourier series and represents the closed orbit as a superposition of epicycles with diminishing amplitude as their circular frequencies grow as multiples of the basic one .",
    "this approach is particularly well - suited for using numerical computations .",
    "an example is provided by the computation of gravitational radiation from non - circular orbits , for which we use the well - known quadrupole formula .",
    "of many equivalent derivations of geodesic deviation equation we present the one which most directly leads to the results used in subsequent applications . given a ( pseudo)-riemannian manifold @xmath12 with the line element defined by metric tensor @xmath13 , @xmath14 a smooth curve @xmath15 parametrized with its own length parameter ( or proper time ) @xmath16 is a _",

    "@xcite .",
    "obviously the procedure can be extended to arbitrarily high order geodesic deviations @xmath34 .",
    "this is of considerable practical importance , as it allows to _ construct _ a desired set of geodesics in the neighborhood of the reference @xmath31 , when the congruence of geodesics is not given a priori in closed form .",
    "indeed , all that is needed is the set of deviation vectors @xmath44 _ on the reference geodesic _ ; obviously these vectors are completely specified as functions of @xmath16 by solving the geodesic deviation equations ( [ geodev1a ] ) , ( [ geodev2b ] ) and their extensions to higher order , for given @xmath31 . as in the case of the first - order deviation ,",
    "it is sometimes convenient to write equation ( [ geodev2b ] ) in the equivalent but non - manifest covariant form @xmath45 an equation for the 3rd - order deviation is presented in appendix 1 .",
    "the non - manifestly covariant geodesic deviation  equations are often better adapted to deriving successive approximations for geodesics close to the initial one .",
    "starting from a given geodesic @xmath46 we can solve eq .",
    "( [ geodev1b ] ) and find the first - order deviation vector @xmath47 .",
    "then , inserting @xmath48 and @xmath49 , by now completely determined , into the system ( [ geodev2d ] ) , we can solve and find the second - order deviation vector @xmath42 , and subsequently for the true second - order coordinate deviation @xmath50 , and so forth .",
    "as an example , below we describe non - circular motion , along with kepler s laws ( in an approximate version ) , together with the relativistic perihelion advance , starting from a circular orbit in schwarzschild metric .",
    "although for orbital motion in a schwarzschild background we have at our disposal the exact solutions in terms of quadratures ( with integrals of elliptic or jacobi type ) , our approach is particularly well - suited for numerical computations , because in appropriate ( gaussian ) coordinates the geodesic curves can display a very simple parametric form , and all the components of the @xmath51-velocity and other quantities reduce to constants when restricted to that geodesic.in this case equation ( [ geodev1b ] ) reduces to a linear system with constant coefficients , which after diagonalization becomes a collection of harmonic oscillators , and all that remains is to find the characteristic frequencies . in the next step , we get a collection of harmonic oscillators excited by external periodic forces represented by the right - hand side of ( [ geodev2d ] ) , which can also be solved very easily , and so forth . in the third order ,",
    "the presence of resonances giving rise to secular terms could in principle lead to instability of the orbit we started with ; but this phenomenon can be dealt with by poincar s method @xcite , according to which such terms can be eliminated if we admit that the frequency of the resulting solution is also slightly modified by the exterior perturbation , and can be expanded in a formal series in successive powers of the initial ( small ) deformation parameter.at the end , the deviation becomes a series of powers of a small parameter containing linear combination of characteristic frequencies appearing on the right - hand side , which are entire multiples of the basic frequency , also slightly deformed .",
    "this description of planetary motion as a superposition of different harmonic motions has been first introduced by ptolemaeus in the ii century @xcite .",
    "we shall now analyse the simplest case of circular orbits in schwarzschild geometry .",
    "let us consider the geodesic deviation equation starting with a circular orbit in the field of a spherically - symmetric massive body , i.e. in the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the circular orbits and their stability have been analyzed and studied in several papers @xcite and books , e.g.  the well - known monograph by chandrasekhar @xcite.the gravitational field is described by the line - element ( in natural coordinates with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) @xmath54 with @xmath55 we recall the essential features of the solution of the geodesic equations for a test particle of mass @xmath56 . as the spherical symmetry guarantees conservation of angular momentum ,",
    "the particle orbits are always confined to an equatorial plane , which we choose to be the plane @xmath57 .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath58 is then directed along the @xmath59-axis . denoting its magnitude per unit of mass by @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 in addition , as the metric is static outside the horizon @xmath62 , it allows a time - like killing vector which guarantees the existence of a conserved world - line energy ( per unit of mass @xmath63 ) @xmath64 , such that @xmath65 finally , the equation for the radial coordinate @xmath66 can be integrated owing to the conservation of the world - line hamiltonian , i.e.  the conservation of the absolute four - velocity : @xmath67 from this we derive a simplified expression for the radial acceleration : @xmath68 the equation ( [ conservation ] ) can in principle be integrated directly ; indeed , the orbital function @xmath69 is given by an elliptic integral @xcite",
    ". however , to get directly an approximate parametric solution to the equations of motion one can also study _ perturbations _ of special simple orbits . in the following",
    "we study the problem for bound orbits by considering the first and second - order geodesic deviation equations for the special case of world lines close to circular orbits.observe that for circular orbits @xmath70 constant , the expressions for @xmath71 , eq .  ( [ conservation ] ) , and @xmath72 , eq .",
    "( [ aradial ] ) , must both vanish at all times .",
    "this produces two relations between the three dynamical quantities @xmath73 , showing that the circular orbits are characterized completely by specifying either the radial coordinate , or the energy , or the angular momentum of the planet .",
    "in particular , the equation for null radial velocity gives @xmath74 then the null radial acceleration condition ( [ aradial ] ) gives the well - known result @xmath75 leading to the requirement @xmath76 for stable circular orbits to exist . with this in mind , and the explicit formulae for the christoffel coefficients of schwarzschild metric ( given in the appendix 3 ) , we can establish now the four differential equations that must be satisfied by the geodesic deviation 4-vector @xmath49 close to a circular orbit .",
    "we recall that on the circular orbit of radius @xmath77 ( which is a geodesic in the background schwarzschild metric ) we have : @xmath78 because @xmath79 , @xmath80 , so that @xmath81  and @xmath82 .",
    "it turns out that the four equations are much easier to arrive at if we use the explicit form of the first - order deviation equation ( [ geodev1b ] ) .",
    "we get without effort the first three equations , for the components @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 : @xmath86 @xmath87 the deviation @xmath88 is independent of the remaining three variables @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the harmonic oscillator equation ( [ ntheta ] ) for @xmath88 displays the frequency which is equal to the frequency of the circular motion of the planet itself : @xmath92 this can be interpreted as the result of a change of the coordinate system , with a new @xmath59-axis slightly inclined with respect to the original one , so that the plane of the orbit does not coincide with the plane @xmath93 . in this case",
    "the deviation from the plane will be described by the above solution , i.e.  a trigonometric function with the period equal to the period of the planetary motion .",
    "being a pure coordinate effect , it allows us to eliminate the variable @xmath88 by choosing @xmath94 .",
    "it takes a little more time to establish the equation for @xmath90 , using eq .",
    "( [ geodev1b ] ) : @xmath95 taking into account that only the components @xmath96 and @xmath97 of the four - velocity on the circular orbit are different from zero , and recalling that we have chosen to set @xmath94 , too , the only non - vanishing terms in the above equation are : @xmath98 using the identities ( [ wellknown ] ) and the definitions ( [ 4velocity ] ) , we get @xmath99 the system of three remaining equations can be expressed in a matrix form : @xmath100 the characteristic equation of the above matrix is @xmath101=0 , \\label{omega1}\\ ] ] which after using the identities ( [ varepsilon ] ) and ( [ wellknown ] ) reduces to @xmath102=0 ,   \\label{omega2}\\ ] ] so that the characteristic circular frequency is @xmath103 it is obvious that the general solution contains oscillating terms @xmath104 ; however , before we analyse in detail this part of solution , let us consider the terms linear in the variable @xmath16 or constants : as a matter of fact , because of the presence of first and second - order derivatives with respect to @xmath16 in the matrix operator ( [ matrixn ] ) , the general solution may also contain the following vector : @xmath105 when inserted into the system ( [ matrixn ] ) , the solution is the following : 0.2 cm 0.5 cm @xmath106  and  @xmath107  are arbitrary ; 0.1 cm 0.5 cm @xmath108 , which means that the radial velocity remains null ; and @xmath109 this condition coincides with the transformation of the initial circular geodesic of radius @xmath77 to a neighboring one , with radius @xmath110 , with the subsequent variations @xmath111 and @xmath112 added to the corresponding components of the 4-velocity in order to satisfy the condition @xmath113 in the linear approximation . after choosing an optimal value for @xmath66 , we can forget about this particular solution , as well as about the arbitrary shift in the variables @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and investigate the oscillating part of the solution.we shall choose the initial phase to have ( with @xmath116 : @xmath117 what remains to be done is to compare this frequency with the fundamental circular frequency @xmath118 of the unperturbed circular orbital motion.but this discrepancy between the two circular frequencies @xmath119 and @xmath120 is exactly what produces the perihelion advance , and its value coincides with the value obtained in the usual way ( [ advance1 ] ) in the limit of quasi - circular orbits , i.e.  when @xmath121 : we get both the correct value and the correct sign.let us display the complete solution for the first - order deviation vector @xmath122 which takes into account only the non - trivial degrees of freedom : @xmath123 the only independent amplitude is given by @xmath124 , because we have @xmath125 so the trajectory and the law of motion are given by @xmath126 where the phase in the argument of the @xmath127 function was chosen so that @xmath128 corresponds to the perihelion , and @xmath129 to the aphelion .",
    "it is important to note once again that the coefficient @xmath124 , which also fixes the values of the two remaining amplitudes , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , defines the size of the actual deviation , so that the ratio @xmath132 becomes the dimensionless infinitesimal parameter controlling the approximation series with consecutive terms proportional to the consecutives powers of @xmath132 .",
    "what we see here is the approximation to an elliptic orbital movement as described by the presence of an _ epicycle _ ( exactly like in the ptolemean system @xcite , except for the fact that the sun is placed in the center instead of the earth ) . as a matter of fact",

    "we then approach finite eccentricity orbits in a fully relativistic scheme , by summing up higher - order geodesic deviations , for which we have derived the explicit expressions .    the two approaches are complementary in the following sense : the post - newtonian scheme gives better results for small values of @xmath267 and arbitrary eccentricity , whereas our scheme is best adapted for small eccentricities , but arbitrary values of @xmath268 . in both approaches the emission of gravitational radiation is estimated using the quadrupole formula , based on a flat - space approximation .    the next challenge is to include finite - size and radiation back - reaction effects . in the post - newtonian scheme some progress in this direction has already been made . in this aspect",
