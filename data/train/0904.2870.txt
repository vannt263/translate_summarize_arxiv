    "gauge / string duality@xcite provides us new insights into gauge theories in strong coupling regime . according to the gauge / string duality , the dual string theory , which corresponds to conformal gauge theories(e.g . , the @xmath6 super yang millis theory ) , is embedded in @xmath7 space with the metric @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ten - dimensional metric and @xmath10 is the mostly plus flat space metric .",

    ", the string theory can be approximated by supergravity .",
    "then the duality reduces to correspondence between gauge theories at large thooft coupling and supergravity , one can investigate the nonperturbative properties of gauge theories at large thooft coupling by studying the corresponding supergravity theory .",
