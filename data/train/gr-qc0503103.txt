    "consider the lorentzian metric of the five - dimensional space written in a gaussian form @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and latin indices run from @xmath11 to @xmath12 while the greek ones go from @xmath11 to @xmath13    by splitting the vacuum einstein equations in terms of the extrinsic and intrinsic curvatures of the slices @xmath14 , it can be shown that the equations have the following structure : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are analytic functions of their arguments , @xmath17 is the covariant derivative with respect to the induced metric @xmath18 ; @xmath19 and  @xmath20  denote , respectively , the scalar curvature and the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface @xmath21 and @xmath22 . recall that in the coordinates adopted the extrinsic curvature assumes the simple form : @xmath23 it is well known that , owing to the bianchi identities , the second and third equations need to be imposed only on the hypersurface , since they are propagated by the first one . in this sense , it is said that the einstein equations consist of the _ dynamical _ equation ( [ dyn ] ) plus _ constraint equations _",
    "( [ c1 ] ) and ( [ c2 ] ) for @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "let now consider the hypersurface @xmath25 according to the cauchy - kowalewski theorem , for any point in this hypersurface , say the origin , there is an open set in five dimensions containing that point , where the equation ( [ dyn ] ) always has a unique analytic solution @xmath26 provided that the following analytic initial conditions are specified : @xmath27    from the perspective of the embedding problem these initial conditions represent , respectively , the metric and the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface @xmath28 , whereas the solution of equation ( [ dyn ] ) gives the metric of the @xmath29dimensional space . thus , if there is a solution for the constraint equations for any given metric @xmath30 , then the theorem is proved , since the solution found @xmath31 substituted in ( [ hds2 ] ) will give rise to a metric that satisfies the vacuum einstein equation @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , the embedding map is then given by the equation @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out , as magaard has proved @xcite , that the constraint equations always have a solution .",
    "indeed , by simple counting operation we can see that there are @xmath34 unknown functions ( the independent elements of extrinsic curvature ) and @xmath35 constraint equations .",
    "the metric @xmath36  must be considered as a given datum . for @xmath7 ,",
    "the number of variables is equal or greater than the number of equations .",
    "magaard has shown that after the elimination of equation ( [ c2 ] ) , the first - order differential equation ( [ c1 ] ) can be written in a canonical form ( similar to ( [ dyn ] ) ) with respect to @xmath0 components of @xmath20 conveniently chosen .",
    "taking initial conditions for these components in such a way that the right - hand side of the mentioned equation is analytic at the origin , the cauchy - kowalewski theorem can be applied once more to guarantee the existence of a solution for the constraint equations .",
    "from the above we see that magaard s proof of the cm theorem is formulated in terms of an initial value problem . roughly speaking we can say that a @xmath37-spacetime is taken as part of the initial data and it is propagated  along a spacelike extra dimension by the dynamical part of the einstein vacuum equations to generate the higher - dimensional space .",
    "nevertheless , it is enough clear that , despite some similarities , the cm theorem is not concerned with real dynamical propagation since the initial data evolve  along a spacelike direction .",
    "therefore there is no reason why we should expect a causality relation between different slices of the higher dimensional space .",
    "however , we can look at this picture from a different perspective .",
    "indeed , supported by the cm theorem , we know that given any point @xmath38 @xmath1 there is a five - dimensional vacuum space @xmath39 into which a neighborhood of @xmath6 in @xmath1 is embedded .",
    "now we can determine an open subset of @xmath40 , say , @xmath41 , containing the point @xmath6 in which there exists a four - dimensional hypersurface @xmath42 , which is spacelike everywhere , acausal and that contains the point @xmath6 ( see appendix i ) .",
    "the embedding of @xmath42 into @xmath43 induces a positive definite metric @xmath44 in the hypersurface .",
    "let @xmath45 be the extrinsic curvature of @xmath42 in @xmath46 the metric and the extrinsic curvature are analytic fields in the hypersurface @xmath42 , thus they belong to the local sobolev space we mean that the norm of @xmath44 together with its covariant derivatives of order equal or less than @xmath47 are square integrable in any open set @xmath48 of @xmath42 with compact closure . for the sake of simplicity , we shall assume that the norm and derivatives are calculated with respect to an euclidean metric .",
    "here we are adopting the notation of sobolev spaces used in @xcite . ] _ _",
    "@xmath49 for any @xmath47 .",
    "the set @xmath50 constitutes appropriate initial data for the einstein vacuum equations , since @xmath44 and @xmath45 satisfy the vacuum constraint equations in the hypersurface @xmath42 and fulfill the required condition of regularity ( see @xcite , page 248 - 249 , and @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "consider now @xmath51 , the domain of dependence of @xmath42 relative to @xmath43 @xcite . since @xmath42 is an acausal hypersurface of @xmath41 ,",
    "then @xmath52 is open in @xmath41 ( see @xcite , page 425 ) .",
    "of course @xmath53 is a non - empty set , since @xmath54 by construction , the five - dimensional manifold @xmath55 is a solution of the einstein vacuum equations , hence @xmath56 is a cauchy development for the einstein vacuum equations of the initial data @xmath57    as we have mentioned before @xmath53 is open , and thus the non - empty set @xmath58 is a neighbourhood of @xmath6 in @xmath1 contained in @xmath51 .",
    "therefore @xmath58 is embedded in @xmath51 , i.e. , in a cauchy development of @xmath59 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in other words the dynamical evolution of the initial data @xmath59 generates a five - dimensional  vacuum space into which the spacetime is locally embedded . in this sense",
    ", we can say that this local embedding is dynamically generated by the physical propagation of those initial data .",
    "more precisely this result can be stated as follows : _ consider an analytic spacetime _",
    "@xmath60 _ _  for any _ _",
    "_  there are initial data _",
    "_ @xmath59 _ _  whose cauchy development for the einstein vacuum  equations is a five - dimensional vacuum space into which a neighbourhood of _ _ @xmath6 _ in _ @xmath1 _ _  is analytically and isometrically embedded . _ _",
    "furthermore , the einstein vacuum  equations admit a well - posed initial value formulation with respect to the data @xmath59 ( see , for example,@xcite ) . therefore the general properties of solutions of the vacuum einstein equations , related to the hyperbolic character of the differential equations , are applicable to our solution @xmath62 .",
    "this ensures that the dependence of the solution @xmath63 on the initial data @xmath59 is continuous ( cauchy stability ) . as a consequence",
    "the spacetime embedded into @xmath64 is stable in a similar sense too , as we describe in the next section .",
    "another important property is that any change of data outside @xmath42 does not affect the solution in the future domain of dependence ( causality ) .",
    "thus it follows that any perturbation outside @xmath42 will not disturb the embedding of spacetime in @xmath51 .",
    "consider an analytic spacetime @xmath3 and let @xmath65 be a set of analytic initial data with a cauchy development @xmath62 in which the spacetime is locally embedded , around @xmath66 additionally let us admit that this initial data set satisfies the following property : the image of @xmath6 through the embedding lies in @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , corresponding to the set @xmath59 there are some neighbourhood @xmath67 of @xmath6 in @xmath1 and a map @xmath68 @xmath51 which is an embedding , with @xmath69 .",
    "was shown in the previous section .",
    "possibly the initial data set is not unique .",
    "the results obtained in this section are applicable separately to each one of all possible initial data set . ]",
    "now we denote by @xmath70 a new set of initial data which satisfies the vacuum einstein constraint equation in @xmath42 . for",
    "the sake of simplicity let us assume that the fields @xmath71 and @xmath72 are @xmath73 in @xmath42 . in this case",
    ", the new generated metric @xmath74 is a @xmath73 field .",
    "let @xmath75 be an open set of @xmath76 , the causal future of @xmath42 in @xmath62 , with compact closure and @xmath48 @xmath77 some neighbourhood of @xmath78 , the causal past of @xmath79 ( the closure of @xmath75 ) in @xmath42 , with compact closure in @xmath42 . according to the cauchy stability theorem ( see @xcite , page 253 , and @xcite ) , for any @xmath80",
    "there is some @xmath81 such that any initial data @xmath70 on @xmath42 close to @xmath82 in @xmath48 with respect to the local sobolev norm , i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 , . ]",
    "give rise to a new metric @xmath74 which is near to the old one @xmath86 in @xmath75 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",
    "now let @xmath75 be such that @xmath75 @xmath88 is a non - empty set , where @xmath58 means @xmath89 the image of @xmath67 through the embedding . and",
    "let @xmath90 be the induced metric on @xmath91 by the embedding of @xmath91 in @xmath92 .",
    "we shall see that if @xmath93 is sufficiently small then @xmath90 will be a lorentzian metric and it will be close to the spacetime metric @xmath4 in @xmath91 .    for",
    "the sake of simplicity , let us make some assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath51 is covered by gaussian coordinates ( [ hds2 ] ) adapted to the embedding , in which the embedding map is @xmath94 .",
    "if this was not the case , we could find a neighbourhood @xmath95 of @xmath6 in @xmath42 and a neighbourhood @xmath41 of @xmath6 in @xmath52 such that the domain of dependence of @xmath95 relative to @xmath43 , @xmath96 is covered by ( [ hds2 ] ) .",
    "we would proceed in the following manner .",
    "since the embedding exists , we know that @xmath97 is a timelike hypersurface of @xmath98 by the usual procedure we construct , from the geodesics that cross @xmath58 orthogonally , gaussian normal coordinates in a neighbourhood @xmath41 of @xmath6 in @xmath99 now make @xmath100 .",
    "we then concentrate our analysis in the region @xmath101 .",
    "second , let us assume that the sobolev norm is evaluated with respect to an euclidean metric defined on @xmath51 and that in coordinates ( [ hds2 ] ) the euclidean metric has the canonical form , i.e. , @xmath102 . then , for example , @xmath103   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] where @xmath104   ^{\\frac{1}{2}}%\\ ] ]    as we have mentioned , in the given coordinates , the embedding map is @xmath94 .",
    "thus the induced metric in @xmath91 by the new solution @xmath74 is given by @xmath105 .",
    "let us show that if @xmath106 is sufficiently small the induced metric @xmath90 in @xmath91 is lorentzian .",
    "metrics which are @xmath73 in the whole manifold belong to local sobolev spaces @xmath107 for any @xmath47 .",
    "thus they obey some important inequalities which hold on sobolev spaces .",
    "for example , according to lemma 7.4.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ( page 235 ) , we have that for @xmath108 , @xmath109 on @xmath75 , where @xmath110 is a positive constant ( depending on @xmath75 ) . thus if @xmath111 , it follows that all components satisfy the inequality @xmath112 on @xmath75 .",
    "the gradient @xmath113 ( @xmath114 is the covariant derivative compatible with @xmath74 ) determines normal direction of the hypersurface @xmath28 in respect to the new solution @xmath74 .",
    "the induced metric will be lorentzian if @xmath113 is spacelike with respect to the metric @xmath74 . in coordinates ( [ hds2 ] ) , we have @xmath115    now",
    ", this metric component can be written as@xmath116 since @xmath117 on @xmath75 , @xmath118 will be positive if @xmath119 .",
    "we know that the determinant is a continuous function with respect to the matrix components in the usual norm .",
    "so there is some @xmath120 which depends only on @xmath86 and @xmath75 ( an estimate of @xmath121 is given in appendix ii ) such that for @xmath122 we have @xmath123 this means that @xmath124 for all points in @xmath75 , since @xmath125 is negative in @xmath75 .",
    "this shows that @xmath90 is lorentzian for @xmath122 .",
    "now let us compare the induced metric @xmath90 with the original spacetime metric @xmath4 .",
    "it is known that for a field in a sobolev space the norm of the restriction of that field to a hypersurface is related to its norm in the manifold ( see @xcite , lemma 7.4.3 , page 235 ) .",
    "according to the mentioned lemma 7.4.3 , there is a positive constant @xmath126 ( depending on @xmath91 and @xmath75 ) such that @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is defined on @xmath91 with the induced euclidean metric .",
    "thus , for example,@xmath129 on the other hand @xmath130 ( by @xmath131 we mean that derivatives are taken only in directions tangent to @xmath91 ) . now consider @xmath132 the induced metric on @xmath133 .",
    "in this special coordinates it is easy to see @xmath134 @xmath135 , since the induced metric has less components than the higher dimensional metric .",
    "therefore @xmath136 .    from the results obtained above we",
    "can now show that if the initial data are sufficiently close to @xmath82 on a neighbourhood of the causal past of @xmath91 in @xmath42 then the induced metric by the new solution is lorentzian and close to @xmath4 in @xmath91 .",
    "more precisely , _ let _",
    "@xmath91 _ be an open set in _ @xmath137 _ with compact closure in _",
    "@xmath1 _ and _ @xmath138 _ _ , there exist some neighborhood _",
    "_ @xmath48 _ of _ @xmath139 _ of compact closure in _",
    "@xmath42 _ and some _ @xmath81 _ such that _ @xmath73 _ initial data _ @xmath70 _ close to _ @xmath82 _ in _ @xmath48 _ _ , i.e. , _",
    "_ @xmath140 _ and _ @xmath141 _ _ , give rise to a metric _",
    "_ @xmath74 _ which induces a lorentzian metric in _",
    "@xmath91 _ which is near to _ @xmath4 _ _ , i.e. , _ _",
    "_    in order to see this it suffices to take @xmath143 ( @xcite ) and to make appropriate choices for @xmath106 and @xmath75 in the cauchy stability theorem .",
    "indeed , let @xmath75 be any neighbourhood of @xmath91 in @xmath144 with compact closure . since @xmath145 then @xmath146 .",
    "thus , taking @xmath48 to be some neighbourhood of @xmath147 of compact closure in @xmath42 , the cauchy stability theorem ensures that there exists @xmath93 such that the new metric generated @xmath74 satisfies @xmath148 for any @xmath80 . now",
    "if we take @xmath149,@xmath150 , we guarantee that the induced metric @xmath151 is lorentzian in @xmath91 and that @xmath152 .",
    "from this analysis we can conclude that for each ambient space whose existence is guaranteed by cm theorem there corresponds an initial data set _ _",
    "@xmath59 _ _ in respect to which it possess , in a certain domain , the desirable physical properties of causality and stability .",
    "this can not be ensured by cm theorem itself , but by an indirect reasoning as discussed above . as a direct consequence of this result",
    "we have found that for any analytic spacetime there exist initial data in whose cauchy development for the vacuum einstein equations it can be locally embedded .",
    "the embedding is cauchy stable and obeys the domain of dependence property with respect to @xmath59 .",
    "the extension of the above result to the case where a cosmological constant is included in the field equations can easily be done . on the other hand",
    "the same analysis can not be applied to the case of a brane in a straightforward way .",
    "the problem is that in this case we can not guarantee the existence of a smooth spacelike hypersurface in an open set of @xmath153 at least by the method employed here , because , as it is known , the brane must be embedded in a space whose metric has a discontinuity in the derivative along the normal direction with respect to the brane .",
    "thus this metric is not analytic in any open set containing the point @xmath6 and for this reason we can not use the cauchy - kowalewski theorem to guarantee the existence of a function whose gradient is everywhere timelike as we have done in the appendix i. nevertheless , this question deserves further investigation .",
    "the analyticity of the initial data in @xmath42 is a restriction imposed by cm theorem .",
    "however , they are not to be considered an unphysical condition .",
    "indeed , it must be realized that a great part of the physical solutions , even in the relativistic regime , are analytic in a certain domain .",
    "the crucial point here is the domain of convergence .",
    "what seems to be an unrealistic is a field which is analytic in the whole manifold .",
    "thus we can say that if we could handle the initial data in the spacelike four - dimensional hypersurface , it would be physically feasible to prepare initial data which are analytic in the interior of a compact domain @xmath154 containing the point @xmath6 in order to generate the desired embedding in the interior of @xmath155 .",
    "moreover we have seen that @xmath73 initial data sufficiently close to an analytic initial data set give rise to embeddings of @xmath73spacetimes which are near to the original analytic spacetime . _",
    "_ this may suggest the possibility of extending the cm theorem to a less restrictive differential class of embedddings .",
    "we are currently investigating this possibility .",
    "consider the five - dimensional vacuum space@xmath156 into which the spacetime @xmath3 is locally embedded around the point @xmath5 .",
    "let us take the following equation for the unknown function @xmath157@xmath158 in gaussian coordinates this equation can be written in the following form @xmath159 let us consider the equation with the positive sign . according to the cauchy - kowalewski theorem",
    ", there is an open set @xmath41 in @xmath40 containing the point @xmath6 where the equation has a solution provided the initial condition @xmath160 ensures that the right - hand side of that equation be an analytic function of its arguments @xmath161 at the point @xmath162 this can be achieved by choosing @xmath163 in such a way that the following inequality be satisfied at the point @xmath164@xmath165 this can always be done .",
    "for example , take @xmath166 , where @xmath167 and @xmath168 is the component of a unit spacelike vector with respect to the spacetime metric at the point @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the solution @xmath169 is a function whose gradient is everywhere timelike in @xmath43 , and this means that stable causality condition holds on @xmath170 .",
    "now let us assume without loss of generality that @xmath171 considering that the gradient of @xmath169 does not vanish in @xmath41 , we know that the inverse image @xmath172 is a hypersurface @xmath42 of @xmath41 . since the gradient of @xmath169 which is orthogonal to @xmath42 is everywhere timelike , then we can conclude that @xmath42 is a spacelike hypersurface .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 is achronal .",
    "indeed , every future directed timelike curve which leaves @xmath42 can not return to @xmath42 since @xmath169 does not change sign along these curves .",
    "it happens that an achronal spacelike hypersurface is acausal @xcite .",
    "therefore @xmath42 is an acausal spacelike hypersurface in @xmath173 .",
    "in this section we want to determine an estimate of how much near to @xmath86 the new metric @xmath74 must be in order to induce a lorentzian metric in @xmath91 .",
    "as described above , this is achieved if the condition@xmath174 holds on @xmath75 .",
    "as we have seen , for @xmath108 , @xmath175 implies that @xmath176 on @xmath75 .",
    "then , there exist a continuous field @xmath177 , with @xmath178 on @xmath179 such that @xmath180 , where @xmath181 .",
    "we want to evaluate @xmath182 .",
    "first let us define @xmath183 as a totally anti - symmetric four index ` tensor ' with @xmath184 .",
    "thus , we can write@xmath185 this expression can be rewritten in the following form@xmath186 where@xmath187    therefore , we have @xmath188    in order to make estimates of @xmath189 it is necessary to eliminate @xmath190 . to this end ,",
    "let us introduce @xmath191 a @xmath192 matrix with all elements equal to unity . using this matrix ,",
    "we get the following estimate@xmath193 similar inequalities hold for every term that appear in @xmath189 .",
    "then we have @xmath194 , for @xmath195 , where @xmath196 is obtained from @xmath197 by substituting each one of its term for the corresponding estimate as above .",
    "it happens that @xmath196 depends only on @xmath198 .",
    "indeed , it is a function constituted of sum and multiplication of the components of @xmath199 .",
    "now for the sake of simplicity let us consider that @xmath200 , ( i.e. , @xmath201 ) , then we have@xmath202 recalling that @xmath203 . since @xmath199 is continuous in @xmath40 , then the right hand side is bounded in any compact set such as @xmath79 .",
    "the same is valid for @xmath204 .",
