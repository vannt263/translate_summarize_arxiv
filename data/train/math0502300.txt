    "moreover , they can be everywhere dense in the unit disc ( the so - called turan s conjecture ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "a recent result of simon and totik @xcite proves even the existence of a `` universal '' measure of orthogonality on @xmath9 for which the zero distributions of the corresponding @xmath25 approximate ( in a weak sense ) all the possible measures on the closed disc @xmath26 .",
    "however , under stronger assumptions on the weight @xmath8 we can say much more . in what follows we will consider only the strictly positive weights @xmath8 on the unit circle that can be extended to an open set containing @xmath9 as a nowhere vanishing holomorphic function .",
    "we will say briefly that such @xmath8 is a _ strictly positive analytic weight _ on @xmath9 .",
    "all the forthcoming statements are valid under this assumption . in order to shed light on this definition",
    "we point out that @xmath8 is a non - vanishing holomorphic function in an annulus @xmath27 ( with @xmath28 ) and strictly positive on the unit circle @xmath9 , if and only if , for any nonzero @xmath29 the following representation is valid on @xmath9 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is holomorphic and nowhere vanishing in the annulus .",
    "in particular , for @xmath32 , the following representation is useful : @xmath33 obviously , here @xmath31 is not uniquely defined .",
    "normalized representations of this form arise from the so - called _ szeg function _ of @xmath8 . indeed , since @xmath8 is strictly positive on @xmath9 , its index ( winding number about the origin ) is @xmath34 , and we may define the szeg function ( see e.g. ( * ? ?",

    "it was shown there ( see also @xcite ) that @xmath55 in particular , strictly positive analytic weights on @xmath9 are characterized by an exponential decay of the corresponding verblunsky coefficients .",
    "furthermore , the szeg asymptotic formula @xmath56 can be continued analytically through the unit circle @xmath9 and is valid locally uniformly in @xmath57 .",
    "it shows that the number of zeros of @xmath58 outside of @xmath59 remains uniformly bounded and these zeros are attracted by the zeros of @xmath38 in @xmath60 ( _ nevai - totik points _ in the terminology of b.  simon @xcite ) .",
    "mhaskar and saff @xcite , using potential theory arguments , gave a relevant complement to these results about zeros showing that for any subsequence @xmath61 satisfying @xmath62 the zeros of @xmath63 distribute asymptotically uniformly in the weak - star sense on @xmath52 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "further results on the asymptotics or zero behavior inside @xmath52 have been obtained so far only for some particular subclasses of strictly positive analytic weights on @xmath9 . besides the classical explicit formula for the bernstein - szeg polynomials ( when @xmath64 , @xmath65 a fixed polynomial with zeros in @xmath66 ) , probably the first important result in this direction was obtained by szabados @xcite , who considered the polynomial case @xmath67 ( where again @xmath68 is a fixed polynomial with zeros in @xmath66 ) .",
    "szabados gave a formula for the orthogonal polynomials with respect to @xmath69 which , although containing unknown parameters , is sufficient for the asymptotic analysis inside @xmath52 .    by extending darboux s formula to szeg orthogonal polynomials , ismail and ruedemann @xcite ( see also @xcite ) obtain matrix expressions for the @xmath70 s for the case of rational weights @xmath71 , where the size of the matrix depends on the degrees of @xmath68 and @xmath65 .",
    "they applied their result to the asymptotic analysis in the case when @xmath52 contains a single zero of @xmath8 .",

    "we obtain results about the distribution of zeros of these orthogonal polynomials , under a variety of different assumptions about the weight function .",
    "these results recover , in particular cases , some of the results mentioned above . the main technique is the steepest descent analysis of deift and zhou ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , based on the matrix riemann - hilbert characterization proposed by fokas , its and kitaev @xcite .",
    "this approach more generally allows one to handle analytic complex valued weights @xmath8 that are nonvanishing on @xmath9 provided the corresponding orthonormal polynomials @xmath72 exist with @xmath73 for each @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , the asymptotic analysis is equally possible ( and technically not much more involved ) for a sequence of varying weights ( when @xmath8 depends on the degree @xmath74 of the polynomial ) .",
    "this was carried out previously in @xcite for a specific weight relevant to the asymptotics of the distribution of the length of the longest increasing sequences in random permutations . a basic discussion of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle , in the context of an example of integrable operators , and their connection with the riemann - hilbert problems is contained in @xcite .",
    "until recently the analyticity of @xmath8 has been a necessary condition for the applicability of the riemann - hilbert asymptotic analysis .",
    "however , mclaughlin and miller @xcite have extended the approach via the solution of a d - bar problem .",
    "their method allows one to handle piecewise smooth and strictly positive weights @xmath8 on @xmath9 ; for this generality they pay the price of less detailed asymptotics .",
    "also their results are qualitatively different : in the settings of @xcite essentially all the zeros approach @xmath9 with a polynomial rate depending on the smoothness of @xmath8 , and those that might stay inside are artifacts of the jumps of the weight .",
    "our asymptotic formulas ( theorem [ thm : nice case ] ) are stated in terms of a sequence of iterated cauchy transforms of the function @xmath75 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the inner and the outer szeg functions defined by . by , @xmath76 is holomorphic in @xmath77 . furthermore , by , @xmath78 and @xmath79 is holomorphic in @xmath80 .",

    "one of our goals here is to make precise the relevant role of the sequences of iterated cauchy transforms related to @xmath76 in the asymptotics of the orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section we state the main results giving a representation of the polynomials @xmath24 , the leading coefficients @xmath81 and the verblunsky coefficients @xmath82 in terms of the series of some canonical functions .",
    "these formulas have an asymptotic nature that we exploit in section [ sec : asymptotics ] , where we present a number of results concerning the asymptotic behavior of the verblunsky coefficients , leading coefficients , and the `` outer '' asymptotic behavior of the orthogonal polynomials .",
    "we also present in section [ sec : asymptotics ] general results describing the asymptotic behavior of the zeros , for a rather wide class of analytic weights .",
    "the detailed assumption is that the exterior function @xmath38 can be extended to the exterior of a domain @xmath83 with finitely many poles .",
    "the proofs of these results are deferred to section [ sec : rh_analysis ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : examples ] we discuss some particular cases , including the case of a weight for which @xmath84 possesses an isolated essential singularity within the unit disk .",

    "occasionally it is more natural to write our formulas in terms of a modified szeg function .",

    ", we set @xmath95 for any analytic function @xmath96 for which these limits exist .",
    "we will also talk about the `` @xmath97 '' and the `` @xmath98 '' side of @xmath92 referring to its inner and outer boundary points , respectively .",
    "choose an arbitrary @xmath4 , @xmath99 , that we fix for what follows .",
    "we introduce the following operators acting on the space of holomorphic functions in @xmath100 with continuous boundary values : @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the exterior boundary values of the function @xmath96 on the respective circles .",
    "let us denote by @xmath103 taking into account , also @xmath104 then straightforward bounds show that @xmath105    it is obvious that for @xmath106 in and for @xmath107 in we may take @xmath9 as the contour of integration in these formulas .",
    "however , our choice makes inequalities evident .    using these operators we define the following sequence of functions : @xmath108 and @xmath109 observe that each of these formulas defines in fact two analytic functions ,",
    "one inside and one outside of the circle where the corresponding integral is taken . in order to avoid cumbersome notation",
    "we will not use the subindices @xmath110 and @xmath111 in this case , but the reader should bear in mind this fact .",
    "by , @xmath112 and in general , for @xmath113 , @xmath114    there are a number of equivalent definitions for the functions @xmath115 .",
    "for instance , @xmath116 we can rewrite the integrand directly in terms of the weight @xmath8 recalling that on @xmath117 , @xmath118 where the integral is understood as its principal value . if @xmath119 is the laurent expansion of @xmath76 in the annulus @xmath120 and @xmath121 is the riesz projection onto @xmath122 , then for @xmath123 , @xmath124 which establishes a connection of the @xmath125 s with hankel operators",
    ". it also shows that for @xmath126 , @xmath127 and convergence is uniform on each compact subset of this annulus . finally , taking into account that @xmath128",

    "the following formulas hold : @xmath138    we emphasize that in each of the regions above @xmath139 and @xmath140 have the meaning given in , and are not obtained in general by analytic continuation from one domain to another .    [",
    "remark : valid_everywhere ] the canonical formulae expressed in appear to be valid for @xmath141 bounded away from the circles of radius @xmath4 and @xmath142 .",
    "however , theorem [ thm : nice case ] holds true for any @xmath4 with @xmath143 , and so the formulae , in fact , are valid up to the boundaries , by analytic continuation . indeed , by considering @xmath144 with @xmath145 , the last formula in",
    "is seen to remain valid by analytic continuation , for @xmath146 .",
    "similarly , the first formula is valid by analytic continuation for @xmath147 . for the middle formula in ,",
    "one considers @xmath148 with @xmath149 , which effectively extends the region where the middle formula is valid .",
    "therefore , the formulae contained in are each in fact valid on the closure of the domains stated .",
    "the second formula in expresses the polynomial @xmath24 on @xmath9 as a sum of `` inner '' and `` outer '' terms .",
    "an alternative two - term expression for @xmath24 on @xmath9 can be found in ( * ? ? ?",

    "allows us to find also a representation for the leading coefficients of the orthonormal polynomials . for this purpose",
    "we define the `` shifted '' sequence with respect to  : @xmath152 inequalities imply again that for @xmath153 , @xmath154    [ prop : leading_coeff ] with @xmath8 as in theorem [ thm : nice case ] , and for @xmath74 satisfying , the leading coefficient @xmath81 of @xmath11 has the following representation : @xmath155",

    "these bounds show that allows us to obtain an asymptotic expression for @xmath161 of an arbitrarily high order .",
    "let us discuss the consequences of truncating @xmath140 and @xmath139 in at their first terms .",
    "for instance , from corollary [ cor : verblunsky ] and theorem [ prop : leading_coeff ] we get the following estimates of the verblunsky coefficients @xmath162 and the leading coefficients @xmath163 :    [ cor : verblunsky2 ] let @xmath8 be a strictly positive analytic weight on the unit circle @xmath9 . with the notation introduced above and for each @xmath137 , @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the corresponding laurent coefficient of @xmath76 in . consequently , @xmath166    another straightforward consequence of truncating @xmath140 and @xmath139 at their first terms is the exterior asymptotics of @xmath167 :    [ cor : asymptotics_ouside ] let @xmath8 be a strictly positive analytic weight on the unit circle @xmath9 , and the constant @xmath50 as defined in . then @xmath168 locally uniformly for @xmath169 and convergence takes place with a geometric rate . in particular , for any compact set @xmath170 in @xmath171 there exists @xmath172 such that for @xmath173 , we have that @xmath174 for all @xmath175 .",
