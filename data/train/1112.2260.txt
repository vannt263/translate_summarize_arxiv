    "a key question in understanding the formation and evolution of galaxies is to find what physical parameters are most sensitive to the star formation process in galaxies ; e.g. , how the star formation activity depends on the environment , and how the relation between star formation and environment changes during the course of galaxy evolution over 10 gyrs .",
    "observational properties of galaxies in the local universe have been extensively studied in the past . typically , actively star - forming galaxies in the local universe have lower masses than passive galaxies and the most massive galaxies tend to be inactive for star formation ( so - called mass - downsizing ; cowie et al .",
    "in addition , the star formation activity strongly depends on environment : star formation rate ( sfr ) decreases with increasing galaxy density ( e.g. , lewis et al .",
    "2002 ; gomez et al.2003 ; kauffmann et al . 2004",
    "; mahajan et al .",
    "2010 ) and the fraction of star - forming galaxies also decreases with increasing galaxy density ( e.g. , carter et al . 2001 ; balogh et al . 2004 ; mateus & sodr 2004 ) .",
    "the fraction of early - type ( passive ) galaxies is higher in higher - density regions while the fraction of late - type ( star - forming ) ones is lower in such environment , called the `` morphology - density relation '' and consistent with the above results ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; dressler et al . 1997 ; goto et al . 2003 ; capak et al .",
    "these findings indicate that the star formation activity in galaxies is strongly related to both the stellar mass and their environment .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) steeply increases in the first @xmath12 gyrs , peaks at @xmath13 , and then decreases by an order of magnitude toward the present day ( e.g. , madau et al.1996 ; lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; shioya et al . 2008 ;",
    "bouwens et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the redshift range of @xmath14 is the key epoch for the most active cosmic star formation in the history of universe .",
    "therefore , studies of galaxies at @xmath15 are important for understanding galaxy evolution . in recent years , wide and deep surveys have allowed us to study star formation activity in @xmath16 galaxies .",
    "for example , elbaz et al . ( 2007 ) and cooper et al . (",
    "2008 ) studied the relation between the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies and the environment at @xmath17 , in the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) and the deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( deep2 ; davis et al .",
    "these studies showed that the average star formation rate increases with increasing galaxy density ( elbaz et al .",
    "2007 ; cooper et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we also investigated the relation between the fraction of star - forming galaxies with [ o ii ]  @xmath18 emission ( hereafter `` [ o ii ]  emitters '' ) and the local galaxy density at @xmath19 in the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ; scoville et al .",
    "2007a ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2007 ) and found that the fraction of star - forming galaxies in high - density regions is as high as that in low - density regions ( ideue et al . 2009",
    "; hereafter `` paper i '' ) .",
    "similar trends were also reported by other observational studies in groups of galaxies ( iovino et al . 2010 ; li et al .",
    "2011 ; sobral et al . 2011 ) and cluster environments ( hayashi et al . 2010",
    "; hilton et al .",
    "2010 ) at @xmath16 . since the fraction of star - forming galaxies decreases with increasing galaxy density in the local universe as mentioned above",
    ", these results suggest that the relationship between the star formation activity in galaxies and their environment dramatically changed from @xmath20 to the present day . on the other hand",
    ", many studies suggest that the star formation activity or the fraction of star - forming galaxies also strongly depends on stellar mass even at @xmath21 ( e.g. , noeske et al . 2007 ; elbaz et al .",
    "2007 ; ilbert et al . 2010 ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the relationships between the star formation activity , the stellar mass of galaxies , and the environment at @xmath17 , in order to reveal the origin of the observed difference in the environmental dependence of the star formation activity between @xmath22 and @xmath20 .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the relationships between the star formation , stellar mass , and environment of galaxies at @xmath23 in the cosmos field .",
    "we have already carried out subaru imaging observations of the cosmos field ( taniguchi et al .",
    "we can obtain the sample of [ o ii ]  emitters in the cosmos field by using a narrowband filter nb816 ( @xmath24   and @xmath25  , see takahashi et al",
    ". 2007 ) and estimate their sfr by using the [ o ii ]  luminosity .",
    "the [ o ii ]  emission line provides a good estimator of the star formation in galaxies at intermediate redshift ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998 ; jansen et al .",
    "the stellar mass in galaxies in the cosmos field was obtained from the fitting of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ; ilbert et al .",
    "thanks to the very large survey area ( @xmath26 2 deg@xmath1 ) of the cosmos field , we are able to obtain an unbiased picture of the star formation activity in galaxies , avoiding the cosmic variance effect .",
    "indeed , the cosmos field includes various regions with a wide range of galaxy density ( e.g. , scoville et al .",
    "2007a , 2007b ; takahashi et al .",
    "2007 ) , which enables us to investigate systematically the environmental effects on galaxy properties .",

    ", we describe the sample selection and possible contamination of the [ o ii ]  emitter sample .",
    "descriptions of the measurements of local galaxy density , stellar mass , and sfr are presented in section 3 .",
    "we investigate the dependence of star formation on environment and stellar mass , and the effect of close companions on the star formation activity , for our sample at @xmath19 in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss implications of our results on the evolution of galaxies from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system .",
    "we adopt a flat universe with the following cosmological parameters ; @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "the cosmos field has multi - wavelength photometric data over an area of @xmath262 deg@xmath1 from x - ray to radio .",
    "we use the cosmos intermediate- and broad - band photometry catalog which includes 16 broad , 12 intermediate , and 2 narrow bands ( capak et al .",

    "photometric redshifts in cosmos are computed using the 25 optical bands , plus 2 galex and 4 spitzer / irac bands ( ilbert et al . 2009 , see also section 3.2 ) .      in order to select [ o ii ]  emitters at @xmath11",
    ", we use the photometric data of @xmath34 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 bands taken on the subaru telescope and those of @xmath35-band taken on the canada france hawaii telescope in the cosmos photometric catalog ( capak et al .",

    "as mentioned in the previous section , we selected our photo-@xmath32 sample and [ o ii ]  emitters at @xmath19 using the photometric redshift and eq ( 1 ) . although the contamination is thought to be small due to the fairly accurate photo-@xmath32 ( ilbert et al .",
    "2009 ) , we examine how our photo-@xmath32 samples are contaminated by foreground or background objects , using spectroscopic redshifts ( spec-@xmath32 ) from the zcosmos redshift catalog ( lilly et al . 2007 ; lilly et al . in prep ) .",
    "the spec-@xmath32 is available for 48 [ o ii ]  emitters and 37 non-[o ii ]  emitters in our photo-@xmath32 sample . among these objects , 44 [ o ii ]  emitters and 24 non-[o ii ]",
    "emitters have spec-@xmath32 within our target redshift range , @xmath52 , while the remaining objects have @xmath53 or @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the contamination rates for the [ o ii ]  emitter and non-[o ii ]  emitter samples are @xmath55 ( 4/48 ) and @xmath56 ( 13/37 ) , respectively .",
    "thus , the contamination rate for our photo-@xmath32 sample ( 932 [ o ii ]  emitters @xmath57 722 non-[o ii ]  emitters ) is expected to be @xmath58 .",
    "we also estimate the incompleteness of our photo-@xmath32 sample , using 90 objects with @xmath50 and @xmath59 .",
    "only 69 objects among them have @xmath60 , and so the incompleteness is @xmath61 ( 21/90 ) . in order to investigate how incomplete our [ o ii ]  emitter and non-[o ii ]  emitter samples are , we divided the 90 objects with @xmath50 and @xmath62 into the narrow - band excess objects and the others , using eq .",
    "( 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "47 objects are narrow - band excess objects , and the other 43 objects do not show a significant narrow - band excess .",
    "all of the 47 narrow - band excess objects with @xmath59 have @xmath60 and are selected as [ o ii ]  emitters , suggesting that photometric redshifts are nearly complete for the [ o ii ]  emitters .",
    "on the other hand , 22 out of 43 objects without a significant narrow - band excess have @xmath60 .",
    "thus the incompleteness rates for the [ o ii ]  emitter and non-[o ii ]  emitter samples are estimated to be @xmath63 ( 0/47 ) and @xmath64 ( 21/43 ) , respectively .    in summary ,",
    "the contamination and incompleteness rates for our photo-@xmath32 sample are @xmath58 . to keep the uniformity of photo-@xmath32 selected sample , we neither exclude the contamination nor add the missed objects into our sample , using the spectroscopic information .",
    "we will discuss how the contamination and incompleteness due to the photometric redshift errors for our photo-@xmath32 and [ o ii ]  emitter samples affect our results in section 4 .",
    "since active galactic nuclei ( agns ) also show emission lines including [ o ii ]  in general , we have to consider the contribution of such agns in our analysis . here",
    "we try to estimate possible agn contamination in our [ o ii ]  emitter sample by taking account of the difference of seds between agns and star - forming galaxies .    stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that agns can be distinguished from star - forming galaxies using a @xmath65-[4.5]$ ] vs. @xmath66-[8.0]$ ] color - color diagram .",
    "while the ultraviolet to mid - infrared ( @xmath67 m ) continuum of star - forming galaxies is the composite stellar black body , an agn continuum is well fit by a power law . accordingly",
    "the infrared sed of agns tends to be systematically redder than star - forming galaxies .",
    "although stern et al .",
    "( 2005 ) defined the agn selection criteria for objects at @xmath68 , some star - forming galaxies at @xmath27 could be misidentified as agns by their criteria . in order to avoid this situation ,",
    "we have newly defined our own agn criteria for objects at @xmath19 examining figures 2 and 3 in stern et al .",
    "our criteria are @xmath69-[4.5])_{\\rm ab } > 0 $ ] and @xmath70-[8.0])_{\\rm ab}>0 $ ] , which are derived from the four irac bands ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath71 m ) in the cosmos photometric catalog .",
    "we apply these criteria for the 587 [ o ii ]  emitters detected in all the irac bands , and then find that 21 objects are identified as agn candidates . of the 345 objects without detection in all four irac bands ,",
    "244 are detected in both 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath71 m .",
    "for these we are able to examine agn candidates only by using the @xmath69-[4.5])_{\\rm    ab}$ ] color and @xmath65_{\\rm ab}-[4.5]_{\\rm ab } > 0 $ ] ; see figure 1 in stern et al .",
    "we find find that 18 of the 244 galaxies are identified as agns by this criterion .",
    "thus , the total number of the agn candidates in our [ o ii ]  emitter sample is 39 , giving the possible agn contamination rate of 4.7% .    it is noted , however , that our mid - infrared color criteria described above may not be useful in identification of liners that are also popular [ o ii ]  emitters in the local universe .",
    "for such cases , we are able to use optical colors to estimate the contamination from liners since host galaxies of liners tend to show red optical colors .",
    "for example , yan et al . ( 2006 ) found that most [ o ii ]  emitters with red optical colors tend to have the liner activity rather than star formation .",
    "lemaux et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also found that most of [ o ii ]  emitters on the so - called red sequence at @xmath72 are identified as either liners or seyferts . in order to examine the contamination from liners in our [ o ii ]  emitter sample , we investigate the sed of the [ o ii ]  emitters and found that almost all galaxies show blue colors , being comparable to those of starburst or local sd  sdm - type galaxies . therefore , we conclude that the contamination from liners is negligibly small in our sample .",
    "thus the possible fraction of agn in our [ o ii ]  emitters is @xmath73% .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the result of garn et al .",
    "( 2010 ) who studied the star formation activity in galaxies at @xmath74 using a sample of @xmath75  emitters and found that the agn fraction is 5 - 11% .    because the agn contamination is negligibly small",
    ", we do not exclude the agn candidates from the [ o ii ]  emitter sample in the following analysis .",
    "however we additionally performed the same analysis given in section 4 for the sample without the agn candidates and found the same results , confirming that the contamination from agns is negligibly small .",
    "in order to investigate the relation between the star formation activity in galaxies and their environment , we quantify the environment from the observational data . we adopt the projected @xmath76th - nearest - neighbor surface density since this density has been often used as an indicator of the galaxy environment in a number of previous investigators ( e.g. , dressler 1980 ; postman et al .",
    "it is also noted that such projected density measurements based on photo-@xmath32 are useful in detecting the so - called large - scale structures and reconstructing the overdensity ( scoville et al .",

    "the local galaxy density is calculated by using the projected proper distance to the 10th nearest neighbor ( @xmath77 in mpc ) as @xmath78 we compute the projected densities for our sample galaxies using the cosmos photo-@xmath32 catalog .",
    "we use a redshift slice centered on each sample galaxy with a width of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for @xmath42 ; ilbert et al .",

    "since it is unlikely that the fraction of contamination or incompleteness depends strongly on the local number density of galaxies , it is expected that the contamination and incompleteness could not significantly change the estimation of local galaxy density ( although contamination could slightly smear out the density contrast ) .",

    "thus we may overestimate the overall [ o ii ]  fraction by @xmath145 ; i.e. , @xmath146 . in order to investigate effects on the mass and environmental dependence of the [ o ii ]  fraction",
    ", we check the stellar mass and environment of the contaminant and missed objects with spectroscopic identification .",
    "we find that those galaxies for the [ o ii ]  emitter sample and for the non-[o ii ]  emitter sample have stellar mass ranges of @xmath147 and @xmath148 , respectively , and exist in various environments ( although they are rarer in high - density environments ) .",
    "thus contamination and incompleteness affect all masses and environments evenly , and so they do not significantly affect the mass and environmental dependence of the [ o ii ]  fraction seen in figure [ fracoii - mass - env ] .",
    "since the contamination and incompleteness for [ o ii ]  emitters are small and do not depend on environment , the stellar mass distribution and the average sfr at a given mass for these galaxies in the different environments ( figures [ mass - his - oii ] and [ sfr - mass - env ] ) are also not significantly affected .    next , we consider effects on the results regarding companions .",
    "since the incompleteness is expected to be independent of the presence or absence of a close companion , the missed objects do not affect the companion fraction .",
    "similarly the contamination from different redshifts is not correlated with the spatial distribution of galaxies at @xmath149 .",
    "therefore the probability of the contamination form chance alignment is expected to be roughly the probability of the chance alignment calculated in section 4.2 ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "when the companion fraction is much higher than the probability of the chance alignment , the large contamination could lower the companion fraction .",
    "however , high companion fractions are seen for [ o ii ]  emitters at high mass in figure [ fraccomp - mass - oiinonoii ] .",
    "since the contamination for [ o ii ]  emitters is small ( @xmath151 ) , it does not significantly affect the companion fraction .",
    "on the other hand , the contamination rate is @xmath152 for the non-[o ii ]  emitters , but the companion fraction for those galaxies is not much higher than the probability of the chance alignment ( figure [ fraccomp - mass - oiinonoii ] ) .",
    "then the effect of the contamination on the companion fraction in the non-[o ii ]  emitter sample also seems to be insignificant , although the companion fraction could be slightly underestimated .",

    "in other words , @xmath160([o ii ] ) of some inactive high - mass galaxies may become higher due to the active star formation induced by galaxy interactions , and thus we observe such high - mass galaxies as [ o ii ]  emitters . on the other hand",

    "it is interesting to note that the influence of interactions and/or mergers on star formation depends both on environment and stellar mass .",
    "this can be interpreted such that massive galaxies need external triggers ( i.e. , interactions and/or mergers ) for active star formation , while the less massive galaxies are form stars regardless of the presence of a close companion .",
    "one possible triggering mechanism for less massive galaxies is minor merger events ( e.g. , taniguchi & wada 1996 ) .",
    "however , such satellite galaxies would be too faint to be detected in our imaging survey .",
    "as an another possible interpretation , it is expected that less massive galaxies contain much gas and can naturally form stars since evolution of those galaxies is slow compared to massive galaxies , which is expected from mass - downsizing ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the environmental dependence of the [ o ii ]  fraction ( i.e. , the fraction of star - forming galaxies ) is seen only at high mass , because 1 ) interactions and/or mergers induce the star formation only in massive galaxies and 2 ) the probability of interactions and/or mergers depends on local galaxy density .",

    "namely , the fraction of blue galaxies in high - density environments is lower than that in low - density environments , especially at low mass .",
    "iovino et al ( 2010 ) also found a similar trend at @xmath161 .",
    "furthermore , they found that the fraction of blue galaxies at @xmath162 does not depend on the environment in @xmath163 .",

    "now a question arises : what is the origin of the difference between @xmath17 and @xmath28 ?",
    "our results suggest that interactions and mergers are likely to induce star formation in massive galaxies in high - density environments at @xmath19 , resulting in the observed high [ o ii ]  fraction of massive galaxies in high - density environments .",

    "we have also found that the average sfr at a given mass is similar among the different environments and is independent of the presence of a close companion ( figures [ sfr - mass - env ] and [ sfr - mass - compnoncomp ] ) , the strength of the star formation induced by interactions in massive galaxies does not seem to be significantly different from other massive star - forming galaxies on average . therefore we expect that there are already some inactive high - mass galaxies with sufficient cold gas for sfr at a given mass at @xmath19 . on the other hand ,",
    "the fraction of gas - poor galaxies is higher in higher density regions at low-@xmath32 ( e.g. , giovanelli & haynes 1985 ; bertram et al .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that a significant starburst occurs in interactions or mergers between gas - poor galaxies ( i.e. , dry mergers ; e.g. , tran et al . 2005 ; cattaneo et al .",
    "2008 ) , even though interactions and/or mergers still occur in high - density regions at low-@xmath32 ( e.g. , patton et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in this context ,",
    "one important difference in galaxies between @xmath164 and low @xmath32 is the cold gaseous content .",
    "since galaxies at @xmath27 are in early stages of their evolution , it is likely that their cold gaseous content is , on average , larger than that in galaxies at low @xmath32 even if such galaxies are located in relatively high - density regions .",
    "it is thus expected that interactions and mergers at @xmath19 could cause intense star formation more frequently since it is known that interactions and mergers between two gas - rich galaxies ( wet mergers ) can induce active star formation and rapidly consume the cold gas ( e.g. , barton et al .",
    "2000 ; woods et al .",
    "in fact , lin et al . ( 2008 , 2010 ) suggest that the fraction of dry mergers gradually increases from @xmath17 to @xmath28 , while the fraction of wet mergers decreases at the redshift range .",
    "if there are many inactive high - mass galaxies with sufficient cold gas for star formation at @xmath19 as mentioned above , there may be some mechanisms responsible for quenching star formation in galaxies while retaining their gas .",
    "for example , it might be expected that high - mass galaxies have experienced starbursts in the past , and then their gas becomes hot and their star formation stops in spite of the existence of the ( hot ) gas .",
    "later the hot gas cools down into cold gas , and then high - mass galaxies actively form stars when interactions and/or mergers occur . as another scenario ,",
    "high - mass galaxies might have consumed most of gas in the past , which is expected from the mass - downsizing of galaxy formation ( e.g. , cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the gas density was already too low to cause intense star formation ( kennicutt 1989 ) . however , if interactions can sufficiently perturb the remaining gas , the star formation can be triggered and they can be observed as high - mass star - forming galaxies in high - density environment . in this case , such galaxies immediately consume their gas in the star formation and these massive galaxies in high - density environment are observed to be passive at @xmath165 .",
    "from these considerations , we suggest the following scenario ; the high - mass star - forming galaxies for which star formation are induced by interactions and/or mergers contribute significantly to the active star formation in high - density regions at @xmath19 .",
    "these massive star - forming galaxies in high - density regions at @xmath19 could quickly consume most of the accreted cold gas .",
    "if this is the case , the star formation activity may not be enhanced when interactions and/or mergers occurred in high - density environments at lower redshift . in this context",
