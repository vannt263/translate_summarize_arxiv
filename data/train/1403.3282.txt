    "when @xmath1 is compact there is a canonical choice of @xmath24 .",
    "in general , the germ of the tubular neighbourhood we construct is local and canonical , in the sense that at any point @xmath25 it depends only on the local structure of @xmath26 around @xmath27 .",
    "of course the map @xmath24 need not be holomorphic , but the two properties above describe ways in which it interacts with the holomorphic structure ( for example the statement that @xmath14 is khler is not immediate given that @xmath24 is not holomorphic ) . even in cases",
    "where holomorphic tubular neighbourhoods do exist they will not in general have this property so what is produced above will be different .",
    "in fact the existence of such a tubular neighbourhood is highly non - trivial even when the submanifold is a single point in @xmath28 .    in the very special case",
    "that there exists a holomorphic @xmath5-action on @xmath2 that fixes @xmath1 pointwise inducing the usual action on @xmath4 obtained by rotating the fibers there is a natural holomorphic tubular neighbourhood of @xmath1 which encodes this symmetry .",
    "if in addition this action preserves @xmath29 then the germ of our @xmath24 will agree with this holomorphic tubular neighbourhood .",
    "since our construction is local this is also true locally around any point @xmath27 ( see proposition [ prop : hologerm ] ) .",
    "we point out that there is a standard way to produce tubular neighbourhoods that only satisfy the first property in the above theorem .",
    "in fact , for any choice of symplectic form @xmath30 on a neighbourhood @xmath8 of @xmath31 such that @xmath32 there exists , after shrinking @xmath8 if necessary , a tubular neighbourhood @xmath33 such that @xmath34 ( this follows by using an arbitrary tubular neighbourhood to pull back @xmath29 and then applying the relative version of moser s theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem 7.4 ) ) .",
    "so by choosing such an @xmath30 that is khler and @xmath5-invariant we get a tubular neighbourhood with property ( 1 ) .",

    "we are not aware of any standard construction that yields tubular neighbourhoods with property ( 2 ) , but we suspect that they are relatively easy to produce .",

    "the germ around @xmath50 of any such @xmath5-invariant regular solution is unique .",
    "we observe that since the central fibre of @xmath35 is of a different topological type to the general fibre , there can never be a regular solution defined on all of @xmath35 . in this sense",
    "a local result such as theorem [ defconethm ] is the best one could hope for .",
    "the uniqueness part of theorem [ defconethm ] is also novel since it does not involve any hypothesis on the behaviour of the solutions near the boundary of @xmath10 .",
    "we explain briefly how such an @xmath52 gives rise to a tubular neighbourhood . since the work of bedford - kalka @xcite it has been known that regular solutions to the hmae generate associated _ monge - ampre foliations _ by holomorphic curves as follows : the kernel of the form @xmath52 defines an integrable distribution of complex lines in the tangent bundle of @xmath10 . by frobenius theorem",
    "it induces a foliation by holomorphic curves , which because of property ( 1 ) is transverse to the fibers @xmath64 . in the case under consideration , @xmath52 is @xmath5-invariant and hence so is the foliation ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we shall say that a leaf of the foliation is _ complete _ if it covers the base @xmath65 ( i.e.  the restriction to this leaf of the projection to @xmath65 is a surjection onto @xmath65 ) . from the @xmath5-invariance it follows that @xmath66 for all @xmath27 ,",
    "thus each @xmath46 is a complete leaf of the foliation . by continuity",
    "we can then find an @xmath5-invariant neighbourhood of @xmath50 consisting solely of complete leaves that pass through @xmath67 , so after shrinking @xmath10 we can assume that @xmath10 is foliated by such leaves .",
    "note that @xmath68 is an @xmath5-invariant neighbourhood of @xmath31 in @xmath4 . by flowing along the leaves of this foliation we get for each @xmath54 a diffeomorphism @xmath69 which remarkably is a symplectomorphism ,",
    "i.e. @xmath70 the map @xmath71 is the desired tubular neighbourhood , and thanks to ( [ eq : pullbacknew ] ) it has property ( 1 ) of theorem [ thm : tubularmain ] , while the existence of the holomorphic leaves assures that it has property ( 2 ) ( the details are provided in section [ sec : tubular ] ) .",
    "we say that a solution @xmath63 to the hmae is _ complete _ if @xmath10 is foliated by complete leaves of the monge - ampre foliation , @xmath72 and whenever @xmath73 then @xmath74 for all @xmath75 .    given a regular solution @xmath63 as in theorem [ defconethm ] we get a complete regular solution by shrinking @xmath10 if necessary .",
    "let @xmath76 denote the vector field which generates the @xmath5-action on @xmath10 .",
    "from the fact that @xmath52 is cohomologous to @xmath77 it follows that the @xmath5-action is hamiltonian , in the sense described in the next theorem .",
    "[ thm : ham ] let @xmath63 be a regular solution to the hmae as in theorem [ defconethm ] .",
    "then the function @xmath78 is a hamiltonian for the @xmath5-action , in that it satisfies @xmath79 moreover @xmath80 is constant along the leaves of the monge - ampre foliation associated to @xmath52 . if @xmath63 is complete then @xmath81 with equality precisely on @xmath50 .",
    "at least when @xmath1 is compact we can use this hamiltonian to select a canonical regular solution @xmath82 to the hmae .    given a complete solution @xmath63 with hamiltonian @xmath80 we define the radius @xmath83 of @xmath63 to be the supremum of all @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",
    "we then define the _",
    "canonical radius _",
    "@xmath86 to be the supremum of @xmath83 over all complete solutions @xmath63 .",
    "note that the radius of a complete solution could be zero , and hence the canonical radius @xmath86 could also be zero .",

    "if @xmath63 is any other complete solution to the hmae as in theorem [ defconethm ] then for any @xmath91 we have that @xmath92 and there @xmath93 .",
    "thus when @xmath88 the function @xmath94 gives a canonical smooth function defined on a neighbourhood of @xmath1 in @xmath2 ( that depends on the khler structure of @xmath2 near @xmath1 ) , whose level sets give a canonical `` flow '' away from @xmath1 , which we will revisit below .      for topological reasons one can not find global regular solutions of the hmae on @xmath95 but instead of looking for local regular solutions one can consider global weak solutions . using a variant of the perron envelope , for any fixed number @xmath96 one can construct a closed positive @xmath51-current @xmath97 on @xmath95 cohomologous to @xmath98 $ ] which restricts to @xmath29 on @xmath99 for @xmath100 and which is maximal in the sense of pluripotential theory .",
    "moreover when @xmath2 is compact and @xmath96 is small @xmath101 in the sense of bedford - taylor , thus @xmath97 is a globally defined weak solution to the hmae .",

    "the above result is interesting even in the simplest case that @xmath1 is a point in an open set in @xmath132 .",
    "this is then a purely local statement and we shall use the optimal regularity to prove the existence of a flow in @xmath132 by sets with a certain reproducing property :    [ thm : flowpoint ] let @xmath133 be a smooth strictly plurisubharmonic function on the unit ball @xmath134 in @xmath135 . define @xmath136 and @xmath137 then for small @xmath126 ( i.e. @xmath138 ) the envelope @xmath114 has optimal regularity .",
    "also for any bounded holomorphic function @xmath139 on @xmath140 we have @xmath141    here @xmath86 is the canonical radius of the hmae associated to the data @xmath142    the reproducing property in arises in the theory of complex moments and the planar hele - shaw flow in fluid mechanics ( see section [ sec : previous ] ) and gives a generalization of this flow to all complex dimensions .      the key tool that we will use to prove the existence of local regular solutions to the hmae is an openness theorem of donaldson @xcite .",
    "this states that on a product @xmath143 where @xmath2 is a compact khler manifold , the set of boundary conditions for which there exists a regular solution to the hmae is open ( in a suitable topology ) .",
    "recall that such a boundary condition consists of a family of cohomologous khler forms @xmath144 on @xmath2 for @xmath145 . if @xmath146 were independent of @xmath147 then the trivial solution to the hmae obtained by pulling back @xmath29 to the product is regular .",
    "thus we have regular solutions to any small perturbation of such a boundary condition .",
    "of course we are not interested in the product , but in the deformation to the normal cone @xmath35 . by working locally around a fixed point @xmath27",
    "it is possible by a simple change of coordinates to translate the hmae on a neighbourhood of @xmath46 to one on a product .",
    "the cost in this change is that whereas we originally were seeking a solution with @xmath5-invariant boundary data , the new boundary data will no longer be @xmath5-invariant .",
    "we shall show , however , that by shrinking attention to a sufficiently small neighbourhood of @xmath148 any boundary data can be made sufficiently close to an invariant one ; and thus we can apply donaldson s openness theorem .",
    "thus for any point @xmath27 we get a local regular solution to the hmae around @xmath46 .",
    "we then observe that regular solutions to hmae enjoy some strong uniqueness properties ( even if they are defined locally ) coming from the existence of the associated foliation .",
    "we use this to show that these local solutions glue together to give a regular solution in a neighbourhood of the proper transform @xmath50 of @xmath44 .",
    "the fact that the solutions we produce are cohomologous to @xmath77 gives the existence of a hamiltonian function , and we use this to define the notion of canonical radius @xmath86 and to get a canonical regular solution to the hmae .    to prove that , if @xmath1 is compact ( or more generally if @xmath88 ) , the weak solution agrees with the canonical regular one in a neighbourhood of @xmath104 we use the legendre transform of the potential @xmath60 to deduce that on some neighbourhood of @xmath104 this @xmath60 is bounded from above by a local potential for the weak solution .",
    "the fact that @xmath149 is harmonic along the leaves of the monge - ampre foliation allows us to use the maximum principle to deduce the reverse inequality .    for the result about the envelopes @xmath114 ,",
    "the key point is that these can be shown to agree with the legendre transform of the potential for the canonical regular solution .",
    "the associated foliation on @xmath35 can then be translated to this optimal regularity result on @xmath2 .",
    "* tubular neighbourhoods : * it is well known that holomorphic tubular neighbourhoods around a complex submanifold @xmath6 need not exist .",
    "in fact if one does exist then the exact sequence @xmath150 must split holomorphically .",
    "there are stronger results on non - existence , for instance it is a theorem of van de ven @xcite that the only connected submanifolds of projective space that admit holomorphic tubular neighbourhoods are linear subspaces .",
    "the local structure around a holomorphic submanifold @xmath1 is studied in seminal works of grauert @xcite and griffiths @xcite , in which some basic notions in algebraic geometry are developed , for example infinitesimal neighbourhoods , notions of positivity of vector bundles and subvarieties , and some vanishing theorems ( see @xcite for a survey ) . in this , and related works , what is often sought after is a `` transverse foliation '' by which is meant a family of disjoint subvarieties @xmath151 for @xmath152 such that @xmath153 .",
    "we have avoided the use of this terminology , but what we produce is clearly analogous only we do not require that these subvarieties vary holomorphically in @xmath154 .",
    "this highlights the key difference : the existence of such a foliation varying holomorphically places strong restrictions on the normal bundle , but by allowing a weaker notion we have existence always .",
    "of course one of the main uses of the deformation to the normal cone in algebraic geometry is to get around the non - existence of holomorphic tubular neighbourhoods ( as used , for example , in intersection theory ) .",
    "thus it is not particularly surprising that this same deformation appears here .",
    "* geodesics in the space of khler metrics : * the dirichlet problem for the complex hmae has a long history , going back at least as far as the fundamental work of bedford - taylor @xcite .",
    "the existence of smooth ( or regular ) solutions is a difficult and much studied problem and can depend in a subtle way on the boundary data ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "following work of semmes @xcite , mabuchi @xcite , donaldson @xcite , it is known that in the case of compact fibres the existence of solutions can be interpreted as geodesic rays in the space of khler metrics , and the existence of regular solutions has deep implications to the theory of extremal metrics ( for example @xcite among others ) . in the above",
    "we consider this problem for the deformation to the normal cone of a submanifold @xmath1 .",
    "this family is the simplest non - trivial example of a _ test - configuration _ that lies at the heart of the yau - tian - donaldson conjecture connecting the existence of a constant scalar curvature khler metric with the algebro - geometric notion of k - stability , and has been studied from a number of points of view ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "so another interpretation of theorem [ thm : mainhmae2 ] is that the phong - sturm geodesic in the space of khler metrics associated to the test - configuration given by the deformation to the normal cone of a submanifold @xmath1 is regular near the orbit of @xmath1 .",
    "* envelopes , equilibrium set and the hele shaw flow : * the kind of envelopes we consider above are basic objects in the study of the monge - ampre equation ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "they are related to the asymptotic behaviour of the partial bergman kernel involving holomorphic sections that vanish to a particular order along the submanifold @xmath1 .",
    "this was first studied in detail in the toric case by schiffman - zelditch @xcite who introduced the name _ forbidden region _ essentially for the complement of what we call the equilibrium set .",
    "this was then taken up by berman @xcite in the general projective case ( from whom we have taken the terminology _ equilibrium set _ ) who proves , among other things , that the envelopes are @xmath155 , and then again by berman - demailly @xcite in the setting of big khler classes .",
    "we refer the reader also to ross - singer @xcite and ross - witt - nystrm @xcite where these envelopes are considered further .    in the particular case",

    "they construct an exponential map @xmath157 which has the property that the image of any concentric circle intersects orthogonally the image of any ray emanating from zero .",
    "one can check that this implies that their exponential map differs from ours , and does not share the properties listed in theorem [ thm : tubularmain ] .",
    "the hele - shaw flow on a general riemann surface is the topic of previous work of the authors @xcite in which we prove the @xmath158 case of theorem [ thm : flowpoint ] .",
