    "these neutron stars accreting from low mass companions typically do not show x - ray pulsations , but some may display instead bursts due to runaway nuclear burning of accreted gas , confirming the identification of the compact objects as neutron stars with the measurement of radii from the burst blackbody spectra .",
    "searches for x - ray periodicities have instead revealed multiple broad power spectral peaks from @xmath0  hz , the quasi - periodic oscillations , as well as a complex and variable noise continuum .",
    "the neutron stars in the z  sources and similar atoll sources may have lower magnetic fields than the neutron stars in pulsars , leading the inner accretion disk to penetrate closer to the surface of the neutron star .",
    "the khz qpo phenomenon probably results from some interaction of a rapidly spinning neutron star and the rapid rotation of the inner accretion disk .",
    "models of the qpos promise to measure the mass and radius of the neutron star ( and thus constrain the equation of state of the degenerate interior ) but different qpo models lead to different results .",
    "studies of spectral variability could help to confirm or refute some of the qpo models .",
    "for example , the mass of the neutron star could be bounded by orbital doppler shifts from the disk and donor star , limits on the inclination , or through keplerian velocities in the accretion disk .",
    "sco  x-1 is close ( 2.8@xmath1  kpc from parallax measurements with the vlba , bradshaw , fomalont &  geldzahler 1999 ) and as a z  source is expected to emit near the eddington limit for a neutron star ( @xmath2  erg  s@xmath3 ) . yet the accretion kinematics and system parameters are not as well known as for cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , more common ( and thus closer ) accreting white dwarf systems , or for x - ray binaries with pulsars or with a high enough inclination for eclipses and x - ray dips .",
    "we still remain ignorant of the shape of the accretion disk , whether it is warped and precesses , and the role , if any , of winds from the disk and companion star that might be caused by the x - ray illumination .",

    "the doppler tomography method , developed by marsh and horne ( marsh &  horne 1988 , marsh 2005 ) takes as input an emission line which is broadened by line of sight motion .",
    "the line must be observed over a good sampling of the binary orbit .",
    "we determine the tomograms using fourier - filtered back projection .",
    "this involves applying the fourier transform to each spectrum , multiplying by a ramp filter and a wiener filter based on the noise level , and then taking the inverse fourier transform .",
    "the resulting spectra were then back - projected , or integrated , to provide a tomogram .",
    "we did not apply maximum entropy regularization .    as a test that our filtering technique does not introduce artifacts ,",
    "we have obtained ( steeghs , d. , personal communication ) the optical spectra of sco x-1 presented in steeghs &  casares ( 2002 ) .",
    "our tomograms of the optical lines ( presented in figures  [ opticaltomo ] ) give similar results to the maximum entropy method used by steeghs &  casares for the lines that we both analyzed .",
    "we have assumed a systemic velocity of @xmath39  km  s@xmath3 for the sco  x-1 system ( steeghs &  casares 2002 ) .",
    "the doppler tomograms are limited by our phase coverage ( 15 time - separated spectra ) and by the reconstruction of the underlying spectrum by correction for interstellar absorption lines (  [ sec : ism ] ) , but the exercise is valuable in rendering the system independent of particular models .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tomo ] we show a doppler tomogram of the blue component of the ovi doublet , which is less affected by interstellar absorption .",
    "we have interpolated between orbital phases for the integration , which we perform between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . a compact bright spot on the tomogram overlaps with emission expected from the roche lobe of the donor star .",
    "there is also a suggestion of an incomplete ring surrounding the position of the neutron star in the tomogram .",
    "the continuum model developed prior to the observations was scaled to the continuum at each fuse orbit and was subtracted from each spectrum . where strong interstellar absorption lines of molecular hydrogen were present ,",
    "we have adjusted for their presence .",
    "we fit the h@xmath22 absorbers to the entire fuse spectrum ( section  [ sec : ism ] ) , and divide the spectrum by this model . in the vicinity of the ovi doublet , we correct also for atomic lyman  @xmath21 absorption , using a simultaneous model for the emission and absorption lines ( see section  [ sec : lines ] ) .",
    "thus the tomograms near ovi corrected for interstellar lines are not entirely model - independent .",
    "we interpolate over any resulting data points that have @xmath42 significance to avoid magnifying the uncertain flux near the trough of saturated absorption lines",
    ". there may be some remaining unidentified and uncorrected interstellar features that overlap with ovi",
    ". there may be absorption from interstellar ovi itself , perhaps enhanced by photoionization of the surrounding ism by sco  x-1 ( mccray , wright , &  hatchett , 1977 ) , but we could not identify such lines unambiguously .",
    "in addition to doppler tomography , which makes no assumptions about the location of the emission , we also fit to the emission lines detailed empirical models that make use of what is known from other studies .    as a preliminary",
    ", we fit the lines with a single broad emission component ( with a gaussian or lorentzian shape ) , subject to interstellar absorption , at each orbital phase .",
    "the centroid of the lines matched closely the expected orbital velocity of the disk ( steeghs &  casares 2002 ) .",
    "the tomograms suggest that emission is also present from a more compact region .",
    "however , models with line width , centroid , and normalization of both narrow and broad components left as free parameters were not constrained by the data .    as further evidence that the lines contain a component emitted in the disk we show in figure  [ fig : lineav ] that the average ovi line near @xmath43 displays a trend of doppler shift as expected from the neutron star .",
    "looking at the differences between the line spectra at @xmath43 from the average ( figure  [ fig : linedif ] ) highlights the presence of a narrow emission component .    to fit a detailed model of both disk and narrow line emission ,",
    "we fixed the centroids of disk emission to those expected based on the mass ratio and velocity curve of steeghs &  casares ( 2002 ) . the disk line is modelled using the method presented in boroson et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , based on horne ( 1995 ) , allowing for turbulence and keplerian shear .",
    "we set the components of the mach turbulence matrix m@xmath44 and m@xmath45 to 1 , and m@xmath46 to 0.5 .",
    "this results in line profiles that are not sharply double - peaked .",
    "horne ( 1995 ) mentions that the m@xmath47 component of the turbulence matrix produces effects that are hard to distinguish from the m@xmath44 component , and that correlated z and r motion is similar to a radial wind rising above the disk .",
    "thus the effects of the turbulence model we assume may mimic the result of an accretion disk wind .",
    "the models of chiang ( 2001 ) show that a disk wind model can fit the uv line profiles of hercules  x-1 , which do not show clear double - peaked structure .",
    "the stellar line is assumed to be a gaussian with the same width at each orbital phase .",
    "the width is left as a free parameter of the fit .",
    "although the gaussian shape is not motivated by physical considerations , it is a useful parameterization that allows us to check our assumption of an emission component arising on the normal star , and to obtain a crude measure of the width , flux , and variability in such a component . in an earlier study of hercules  x-1 ( boroson et al .",

    "the narrow gaussian lines from the normal star appear to be much weaker near @xmath64 , so that in spite of the low inclination of the system , the heated spot on the donor star may be obscured .",
    "the best - fit projected velocity at the outer edge of the accretion disk , @xmath65  km  s@xmath3 , implies a disk radius @xmath66  cm for @xmath54 . while significantly smaller than the result of 2.5@xmath67  cm found from fits to civ and nv lines by kallman et al .",

    "if the disk inclination is 38@xmath69 , or 1@xmath70 below the measured value of the jet inclination as favored for the orbital inclination by steeghs &  casares ( 2002 ) from orbital constraints , then the outer disk radius implied by the best - fit @xmath55 is 1.5@xmath67  cm .    in figure  8",
    "we show the total flux in the disk and narrow lines as a function of orbital phase and in figure  9 we show the velocities of the doppler shifts of the centroids of the narrow emission components of oiv as a function of orbital phase .",
    "the results of the fit to ovi should be treated with caution because of the extensive modeling of interstellar lines required to match the data .",
    "the choice of a gaussian shape for the stellar component probably does not have much of an effect on our conclusions about the accretion disk .",
    "when we use a lorentzian shape instead , the average disk flux only differs by 3%  and the disk flux at the 15 phases observed , as determined by both fits in which the stellar component has a gaussian or lorentzian shape , have a cross - correlation coefficient of 0.93 .",
    "if instead we fit our model to only half of the observations , we still obtain a disk edge velocity of 200  km  s@xmath3 and a radial emissivity power law constant of -0.98 . thus our fitted parameter values appear not very sensitive either to our choice of the emission profile from the donor star or from our sampling of the data . comparing the parameters",
    "obtained when the mass - accretion rate parameter is fixed to the value giving the eddington luminosity also gives a sense of how sensitive our fits are to assumptions made about the system .",
    "we test the model by applying it to the ciii lines at 1175 . while there are no clear interstellar absorption features near 1175 , either atomic or molecular , the interaction between the 6 components of the lines may present complications .",

    "could also be accomodated by the ciii lines , we fixed the ratio of narrow stellar to broad disk emission at each phase to that found for ovi ( the fit with the mass accretion rate through the disk as a free parameter ) .",

    "et al . ( 2007 ) , we also considered the ratio of niii at 991  to ciii at 977  as a diagnostic of the bowen process contribution to the 991  line . for sco  x-1 , this is rendered difficult by the larger interstellar absorbing column .",
    "the ciii line overlaps both a saturated absorption line from interstellar ciii and also an oi line at 976.448 .",
    "raymond ( 1993 ) found ratios between the niii line excited collisionally and ciii@xmath90 of @xmath91 assuming cosmic abundance .",
    "if instead abundances enhanced by the cno process were assumed , the ratio would be @xmath92 . for her",
    "x-1 the ratio of @xmath93 did not require enhancement by bowen fluorescence .",
    "in the case of sco  x-1 , our attempts to fit the ciii line suggest @xmath94 .    given that",
    "even for e(b - v)=0 , we expect from non - contemporaneous observations of niii lines at 4640   that only 17%  of the line flux arises from the bowen process , and that the fluorescence lines at 1184  were not observed , it seems likely that bowen fluorescence can not explain the large @xmath95 ratio . instead , we suggest either that cno processing has enhanced the n / c ratio beyond that assumed by raymond ( 1993 ) , or that our models have underestimated the ciii flux at 977 , which may be concentrated at wavelengths that overlap with saturated interstellar absorption .",
    "this conclusion depends on the suitability of the non - contemporaneous observations for comparison .",
    "the optical lines at 4640  and uv lines at 991  may be highly variable , and the values we have adopted could have been measured when the source was in extreme states of line flux .",
    "uv emission line variability , whether investigated through differences from the mean spectrum , through doppler tomography , or through detailed line models , suggests that a portion of the emission arises from the accretion disk and that in addition , narrower emission lines are present . for much of the binary orbit ,",
    "the narrow lines appear to move as expected from the x - ray heated face of the normal star .",
    "the spectra and models are not sufficient to determine whether deviations are the result of scattering of the resonance lines , perhaps in an outflowing wind , or whether another source of emission , for example a hot spot where the gas stream strikes the disk , may contribute .",
    "when we compare the line fluxes with those predicted by raymond ( 1993 ) , as shown in table  4 , we find the rms difference is at a minimum for e(b - v)@xmath96 , but that the pearson correlation is highest ( for either the cos model with cosmic abundances or the cno enhanced model ) for e(b - v)@xmath97 , with the cno model providing a higher correlation to the observed line fluxes ( observed at 3 separate times with 3 different instruments ) than the cos model . for e(b - v)@xmath97 ,",
    "the dereddened line fluxes observed are @xmath98 greater than predicted by raymond ( 1993 ) .",
    "some of this may be explained by the larger disk radius that we find .",
    "we also note that the emission lines were not observed contemporaneously .",
    "table  4 presents line fluxes measured at separate times using fuse ( niii , ovi , and ciii ) , ghrs ( nv and civ ) , and cos ( siiv and ov ) .",
    "the siiv line flux in the cos model is greater than the flux observed for e(b - v)=0.1 , whereas the ovi flux is under - predicted .",
    "if the mass accretion rate were higher during the fuse observation than the cos observation , this could explain both the higher ovi flux compared with the model and the greater disk radius .",
    "the interpretation of the lines depends not only on the uncertain mass accretion rate and amount of interstellar extinction ( we show fluxes dereddened for e(b - v)@xmath89 ) but also on the details of the reddening curve in the far uv range .",
    "we have assumed the ccm reddening curve ( cardelli , clayton , &  mathis , 1989 ) , scaling between e(b - v ) and a(v ) by using @xmath99 , but there the column towards sco  x-1 may have unusual reddening in the far uv , similar to @xmath70  sco ( schachter , filippenko , &  kahn 1989 ) .",
    "we examined the reddening curves fit by gordon , cartledge , &  clayton ( 2009 ) to 75 sight lines using fuse spectra , and find in particular that the sample star closest to sco  x-1 , hd  147888 , does not require a weaker correction for far uv wavelengths than typical , although the difference in the fit parameter that determines this effect , @xmath100 , is only @xmath101 .",
    "still , we find that the details of the redening curve may contribute some systematic uncertainty to the line estimates beyond the uncertainty in the quantity of reddening .",
    "for example , for e(b - v)=0.1 , using the ccm model , the dereddening of niii at 991  is 2.2 times greater than the dereddening of civ at 1550 .",
    "using instead the parameters for hd  147888 , including @xmath102 , the dereddening is only 1.8 times great for niii .",
    "our disk line models very crudely estimate the mass flow through the accretion disk .",
    "the optical depths of the lines follow from the density determined by @xmath50 and our assumed atomic abundance and ion fraction .",
    "we do not model the ionization in the disk , but assume the peak fraction given by model  5 of the photoionization calculations of kallman &  mccray ( 1982 ) .",
    "the niii lines near 990  give a lower @xmath50 estimate than the other lines , but this blend includes a non - resonance line .",
    "the bowen process does not appear to contribute to the niii line , either based on the strength of the feature expected from the optical lines or on the absence of features near 1184 .",
    "the strength of the niii line relative to the ciii line at 977  provides more circumstantial evidence for cno enhancement , although the 977  line , in common with much of the spectrum observed with fuse , coincides with saturated instellar absorption features .",
    "although the far uv spectrum of sco  x-1 is subject to many interstellar molecular and atomic absorption features , the emission lines may be resolved into components similar to those seen in hercules  x-1 ( boroson et al .",
    "2007 ) : narrow lines associated with the x - ray illuminated face of the donor star and broad lines associated with the accretion disk around the compact object . in further work",
    "( boroson et al .",
    "2014 , in preparation ) , we will present similar results for the z - source cygnus  x-2 , observed with the hst  cos .",
    "for some emission lines the fits are not good or imply a disk larger than the roche lobe of the neutron star .",
    "the widths of the broad lines are easier to accomodate if the inclination of the disk is at the low end of the jet inclination range of 44@xmath103 . among the idealizations we have made in our disk model",
    "is the assumption that the disk is flat and not warped .",
    "a warped disk , as generally accepted in the her  x-1 system as an explanation of its 35-day x - ray cycle , would present different inclinations at different radii .",
    "a disk warp may shield portions of the disk from direct x - ray illumination as well .",
    "the current observations can not constrain the full three - dimensional variable shape of the disk to confirm models of a disk warp .",
    "we find no clear p  cygni absorption feature from a disk wind or an x - ray induced wind from the donor star , as we found in her  x-1 ( boroson et al . 2001 ) .",
    "sco  x-1 has a lower inclination so such winds may not cover the line of sight towards emitting regions .",
    "x - rays from the neutron star may remove ions responsible for the uv resonance lines outside of the shadow of the accretion disk .",
    "the low inclination of sco  x-1 also limits how much of the accretion disk shadow covers the emitting regions .",
    "much remains to be learned about accretion in sco  x-1 : the extent and role of disk winds versus turbulence , why some lines are fit poorly or require a disk too large , and the extent of disk warping , and what is changing as the x - rays move along the z  track .",
    "the low orbital inclination prevents the use of eclipse mapping as a tool . instead , the response of the uv emission lines to the stochastic variability of the x - ray source may probe both the x - ray variability ( for example , how isotropic it is ) and the varying shape and physical conditions of the uv reprocessing regions .",
    "future observations coordinating simultaneous x - ray and uv spectroscopy are encouraged .",
