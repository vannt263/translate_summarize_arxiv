    "the scaling theory of order formation processes was established by one of the authors ( m.s . ) in 1976 @xcite .",
    "this scaling theory focuses on an order parameter , namely magnetization , and clarifies the process from an unstable state to the final stable state .",
    "according to the scaling theory @xcite , the order formation process can be expressed by the asymptotic expansion with respect to the scaling time @xmath0 , namely @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes time , and @xmath3 a constant real number @xcite .",
    "the scaling theory can be applied to many phenomena including fish schooling @xcite and nuclear fission @xcite . in parallel to the works on applications , it was repeatedly tested [ 5 - 7 ] using analytic and numerical methods .",
    "recently , relaxation processes including the order formation become more important in such complex systems as glass - like systems [ 8 - 10 ] .",
    "in many complex systems , there exists a highly symmetric structure in an apparently disordered state .",
    "for example , in the spin - glass phase , no magnetization appears , while a spin - glass ordered state appears . in the present study",
    ", we clarify the ordering processes in a system including two order parameters , namely even - parity order - parameters ( namely ,  even order parameters \" ) and odd - parity order - parameters ( namely ,  odd order parameters \" ) .",
    "this is one of the typical examples in the above complex systems .    at first",
    ", we introduce a set of langevin equations describing our system with even and odd order parameters .",
    "thus we analyze directly the langevin equations in section 2 . using the distribution functions ,",
    "the langevin equations can be represented by the fokker - planck equations .",
    "we solve the fokker - planck equations and obtain the relevant onset time in our system in section 3 .",
    "the time evolution of the entropy is obtained from the distribution function as shown in section 4 .",
    "a typical example of the present order formation process appears in the four - body interaction model @xcite and a spin - glass model .",
    "we discuss a simple derivation of this process from the four - body interaction model in section 5 . a summary and discussions",
    "are given in section 6 .",
    "in this subsection , we make a brief review of the basic theory of the order formation @xcite using our notation . it may be useful to introduce our langevin equations .",
    "the basic theory @xcite expresses the phase transition from an initial unstable state to the final stable state .",
    "the time dependence of the order parameter @xmath4 on the double well potential @xmath5 is obtained by the langevin equation @xcite @xmath6 where the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath7 depend on the temperature @xmath8 .",
    "especially the parameter @xmath3 takes a positive value ( @xmath9 ) for @xmath10 , where the temperature @xmath11 denotes the critical temperature . note that the noise @xmath12 is assumed to be a white gaussian noise : @xmath13 where the average @xmath14 denotes the stochastic average of the random parameter @xmath15 under the random noise @xmath16 , and the constant value @xmath17 denotes the strength of the noise .    using the langevin equation ( [ eq1 ] ) ,",
    "the fluctuation @xmath18 of the order parameter @xmath4 is obtained as @xcite @xmath19 under the scaling limit @xcite @xmath20 where the scaling time @xmath0 is defined @xcite by @xmath21 the scaling limit ( [ eq4 ] ) means the limiting - case of the small noise or small nonlinearity .",
    "this scaling limit corresponds to the condition which appears in the order formation processes . as shown in eqs.([eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , the order formation process is scaled exponentially by the scaling time @xmath0 . according to this scaling theory",
    ", an ordered state appears in the following time scale , namely  onset time \" @xcite : @xmath22      as discussed in section 1 , in many complex systems , there exists a highly symmetric structure in an apparently disordered state .",
    "then we classify the order parameters from the view point of the parity , that is , one is the odd - parity order - parameter ( namely , the",
    " odd order parameter \" ) and another is the even - parity order - parameter ( namely , the  even order parameter \" ) . a typical example including these order parameters is shown in four - body interaction models @xcite . in this example , the magnetization corresponds to the _ odd _ order parameter , while the spin - pair corresponds to the _ even _ order parameter . in four - body interaction models , under the gauge transformation @xmath23 ,",
    "the magnetization @xmath24 changes into @xmath25 , while the spin - pair order parameter @xmath26 does not change .",
    "then , in general , the even order parameter is denoted by @xmath27 and the odd order parameter is denoted by @xmath28 below . here the two characteristic temperatures @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be defined as the transition temperatures corresponding to the even and odd order parameters , respectively , as shown in fig.[fig1 ] . because the even order parameter @xmath27 has higher symmetric property , the transition temperature @xmath29 is higher than @xmath30 . in many cases , such as four - body interaction models or some spin - glass models ,",
    "the lower critical temperature @xmath31 is zero .",

    "phenomenologically , since the parameter @xmath28 does not order at any temperature , the dynamics of @xmath28 is described by the harmonic potential .",
    "then the force @xmath41 in eq.([eq7 ] ) is defined as @xmath42 on the other hand , the ordered state characterized by the parameter @xmath27 is induced by the fluctuation of the parameter @xmath28 .",

    "the time evolution of the fluctuation @xmath53 of the parameter @xmath27 is more rapid than that of the parameter @xmath28 , namely @xmath54 .",

    "this effect corresponds to the order formation of our model .",
    "it is interesting to note that the entropy @xmath122 becomes very small as time @xmath2 increases .",

    "this is a typical example of the present order formation with two different order parameters",
    ".      it may be useful to compare the above four - body interaction model with a spin - glass model .",
    "here we consider the hamiltonian @xmath143 including random interactions @xmath144 between ising spins @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the random average of the physical parameter @xmath147 is denoted as @xmath148 = \\int dj_{ij } p(\\ { j_{ij } \\ } ) q(\\ { j_{ij } \\ } ) , \\label{eq48}\\ ] ] using the distribution function of @xmath144 , namely @xmath149 . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq43 ] ) , the spin moment @xmath150 follows the equation of motion as @xmath151 where the parameter @xmath152 is defined as @xmath153 .",

    "the present analysis corresponds to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite because the decoupling approximation is the same approximation as a mean field theory @xcite .",

    ". then the second term of the right hand side of eq.([eq50 ] ) yields @xmath160 using eq.([eq49 ] ) . expanding the hyperbolic tangent in eq.([eq51 ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath161 = -[\\langle s_{i } \\rangle ^2]+\\sum_{k , l } [ k_{ik}k_{il } \\langle s_{k } \\rangle \\langle s_{l } \\rangle ] + \\cdots . \\label{eq52}\\ ] ] with the use of the symmetric distribution of @xmath144 satisfying @xmath162=k^2\\delta_{k , l } { \\text { and } } [ k_{ij}]=0,\\label{eq53}\\ ] ] we introduce the decoupling approximation of the random average in eq.([eq52 ] ) as @xmath163 \\sim k^2 q , \\label{eq53 } \\\\ & [ k_{ik_1}k_{ik_2}k_{ik_3}k_{ik_4 } \\langle s_{k_1 } \\rangle \\langle s_{k_2 } \\rangle \\langle s_{k_3 } \\rangle \\langle s_{k_4 } \\rangle ] \\sim k^4 q^2,\\label{54}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so on @xcite .",
    "finally , we arrive at the time development of even order parameter @xmath164 as @xmath165 where @xmath166 and the parameter @xmath167 denotes @xmath168 and the number of nearest neighbor spins . here , we have @xmath169 and @xmath170 .    as shown in eq.([eq55 ] ) , the spin - glass model is different from the models described by eqs.([eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) in that the squared term of the order parameter @xmath164 , namely @xmath171 , exists in the former model . this is because the spin - glass model belongs to a universality class different from that of the four - body interaction model , as shown in the previous studies @xcite",
    "actually , this squared term of the spin - glass order parameter @xmath164 is also derived from the well known free energies of spin - glass models @xcite .",
    "then the properties of the order formation process of spin - glasses are different from our model described by eqs.([eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) .",
    "as is seen in this comparison , the order formation process of spin - glasses is more complicated because it includes not only plural order parameters but also the randomness and frustration .",
    "in the present study , we have introduced a simple system phenomenologically including even and odd order parameters and we have analyzed by the langevin equations , the fokker - planck equations , and the non - equilibrium entropies . as a result , we have clarified the order formation processes from the view point of the parity .",
    "the present system may be useful for understanding the order formation processes of the complex systems characterized by many order parameters .",
    "especially , the present study indicates a possibility of the increasing total entropy of the complex systems with a certain condition even on the ordered phase .    by the way",
    ", it seems to be a little bit strange that the expression of the moment @xmath172 in eq.([eq40 ] ) is different from that in eq.([eq15 ] ) for the same physical quantity .",
    "this is because we have made a simple decoupling approximation to obtain the langevin equation ( [ eq15 ] ) , though a sophisticated approximation has been made to obtain the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq40 ] ) . since the decoupling approximation corresponds to a kind of mean - field theory , the moment @xmath172 in eq.([eq15 ] )",
    "is different from the fluctuation obtained by the fokker - planck equations ( [ eq18 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) . in the above reasons ,",
    "the expressions are different from each other .",
    "however , both of the expressions ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq40 ] ) show the same behavior qualitatively , that is , the initial fluctuation of the _ even _ order parameter is enhanced by the noise through the fluctuation of the _ odd _ order parameter .",

    "<S> each order parameter shows different parity under a gauge transformation , namely even and odd order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a spin - glass model , the even order parameter corresponds to the spin - glass order parameter while the odd one corresponds to the magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce phenomenologically a set of langevin equations to express the ordering process under a white gaussian noise . using two kinds of fokker - planck equations , </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the order formation process and the entropy production . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show the noise dependence of the onset time .    order formation of complex systems , scaling theory of order formation , entropy production , even - parity / odd - parity order parameter , onset time , time evolution of distribution functions </S>"
