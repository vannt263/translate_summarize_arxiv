    "we focus on the case of two magnetic impurities .      in order to generalize the lanczos scheme proposed in ref .  , we propose two strategies , and will later show that they are intimately connected .",
    "the first technique consists of applying the extended block lanczos method .    as done before for the single impurity ,",
    "the first step is to choose the seed states .",
    "we will choose them to be single - particle orbitals sitting at the same lattice sites as the impurities , say sites @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that the hybridization terms in @xmath67 will remain unchanged under this transformation .",
    "the two initial states for the transformation are , @xmath70 where we have ignored the spin subindexes for simplicity . a new set of states can be obtained using the extended lanczos recursion method ,            so far , we have obtained a new non - normalized basis .",
    "however , states @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not necessarily orthogonal . in order to obtain a full set of orthonormal states , we use a gram - schmidt procedure to orthogonalize these states ( note that this is not the only choice ) .",
    "@xmath81      @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are @xmath85 matrices .",
    "this method can readily be extended further to more impurities . for @xmath86 impurities ,",
    "each @xmath87 and @xmath88 matrix will be @xmath89 .",
    "this matrix represents a new non - interacting tight - binding hamiltonian , with each block representing a unit cell . for @xmath86 impurities ,",
    "it can be recognized as @xmath86 coupled chains forming a @xmath90 ladder .",
    "the new geometry is now quasi one - dimensional .",
    "we now turn to the particular case of the square lattice , and we look at what happens if the two impurities are on the same or opposite sublattices . in the first case , all the @xmath87 matrices will be zero , and the @xmath88 matrices will be lower triangular .",
    "this is represented in the slanted ladder shape of fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder](c ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the impurities are on opposite sub - lattices , the @xmath87 matrices will be off - diagonal , while the @xmath88 matrices are diagonal .",
    "this is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder](b ) .",
    "the first @xmath2 orbitals ( where @xmath2 is the distance between the two impurities ) will simply correspond to the single particle orbitals of two single - impurity problems , generating two independent chains . as the number of iterations increases , the orbitals will overlap , and",
    "the transformation will introduce mixing in order to preserve the orthogonality , leading to the hopping terms between both chains .",
    "now , lets turn our attention to a simple trick that will enable us to simplify the geometry of the equivalent problem even further in the case of lattices where we can define inversion symmetry .",
    "we just choose the initial states as linear combinations of single - particle orbitals @xmath92 representing symmetric ( bonding ) and antisymmetric ( anti - bonding ) states , respectively .",
    "for each initial state , the lanczos iteration procedure is identical to that described in the single - impurity problem @xcite . under this transformation ,",
    "the many - body interactions in @xmath67 will be modified , introducing terms mixing the impurities , and the first two orbitals of both chains @xmath93 .",
    "however , the equivalent hamiltonian will remain one - dimensional , and local , as shown in fig .  1 in the main text .",
    "notice that this symmetrization is identical in spirit and form to the folding transformation used in nrg calculations for the two - impurity problem @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that our symmetrization takes place in real space , instead of momentum space .",
    "it is easy to show that both mappings are equivalent by simply taking any of the ladders in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] , and symmetrizing the orbitals under a reflection with respect to a plane parallel to the chains .",
    "the equivalent hamiltonian will be nothing else but the chain in fig .  1 in the text .",
    "as a consequence , the entanglement in the problem is reduced by a factor @xmath69 , which translates into an exponential gain in terms of the number of states needed in the dmrg simulation .      in the block lanczos approach ,",
    "the bipartite entanglement is proportional to the number of legs , or impurities , in the problem .",
    "the main advantage of the folding transformation is that the entanglement gets reduced by two , and the number of states needed in the calculation is reduced by a power of @xmath95 .",
    "for the dmrg simulations , we take a total system size to be @xmath29 ( including impurities ) , such that each impurity can form part of a collective rkky state or its own kondo cloud ( it has been already observed that kondo does not develop in chains of length @xmath30 @xcite ) .",
    "we have considered values of @xmath31 up to @xmath32 , which corresponds approximately to a `` sphere '' around the two impurities of radius @xmath33 . as explained in ref .  , we assume `` infinite boundary conditions '' , corresponding to orbitals that expand outward from the impurities and never hit any boundaries , which is valid if one is interested in the thermodynamic limit , in a similar spirit as the nrg approach .",
    "these system sizes are 4 times larger than the inter - impurity distance , and we have not observed significant finite size effects .",
    "since the energy difference between the ground - state and the first excited state can be very small ( @xmath96 ) , we fix the truncation error at @xmath97 in all simulations , which translates into a number of dmrg states of the order of @xmath98 or more in most cases . notice that this level of accuracy would be unattainable on the ladder geometry ( without the bonding - antibonding symmetrization ) due to the larger entanglement ."

    "<S> this counterintuitive result may be an indication of non - perturbative effects .    </S>",

    "<S> this is identical to the flat dos used in nrg calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , for all ranges of couplings @xmath6 studied in this work , we have found important lattice effects , in agreement with previous quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this illustrates the limitations of considering only spherical plane waves as the basis for constructing the nrg hamiltonian @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , a remarkable result in early nrg studies of the two impurity problem @xcite  with a linear dispersion and ignoring details of the lattice  indicated the existence of a non - fermi liquid critical point , characterized by a value of the spin correlations @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> further qmc studies on two and three dimensional systems , with both a quadratic dispersion and a lattice , did not find any evidence of such a state @xcite . </S>",
