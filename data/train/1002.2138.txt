    "a detailed investigation of the electromagnetic ( em ) properties of hadrons and nuclei requests a careful treatment of the current operator for interacting fermion systems . in particular , besides general properties like the poincar covariance , the gauge symmetry of the em interaction plays the well - known essential role , that leads to the ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) for the em vertex function . in this short presentation , some insights will be given on the main ingredients of our approach @xcite aimed to construct a 3d em current for an interacting two - fermion system , that i ) fulfills wti and therefore allows the current conservation ( cc ) and ii ) preserves at large extent the poincar covariance , emphasizing the relevant steps for obtaining workable expressions to be used in actual calculations .",

    ", one can establish a formally exact correspondence between 4d bs amplitude and the 3d lf `` valence '' wave function .",
    "then it is possible to express , without approximation , the matrix elements of the 4d em current , where the bs amplitudes appear , in terms of matrix elements of a 3d lf current , that fulfills the wti .",
    "it should be pointed out that in these last matrix elements the valence states are present .    within the quasi - potential approach for the t - matrix , where the so - called _ effective interaction _ appears",
    ", one can develop a meaningful approximation scheme for evaluating the 3d matrix elements , based on the fock decomposition of the effective interaction .",
    "in particular , one expects a decreasing influence of the fock states that contain an increasing number of intermediate particles .",
    "this machinery allows one to construct an iterated approximation of the effective interaction and eventually to evaluate matrix elements of the `` truncated '' lf em current , that still fulfills at any order the lf wti . finally , by using a yukawa model in ladder approximation , as a pedagogical example , explicit expressions for many - body contributions to the em lf current",

    "the em vertex , @xmath12 , corresponding to the interaction @xmath9 has a free term , @xmath13 , and another one , @xmath14 , which depends on the interaction , as requested by the commutation rules with the generators of the poincar group .",

    "g^-1(k_i ) [ wti]where @xmath15 is the 4-momentum transfer and @xmath16 is the pointlike charge operator with matrix elements given by @xmath17    combining eqs .",

    "( [ bse ] ) , i.e. , q__f|j^(q)| _ i=_f|  |_i=0  .    after introducing the general equations fulfilled by bs amplitudes and em current ,",
    "let us illustrate our procedure .",
    "as well known , the t - matrix is given in terms of the interaction @xmath9 by an integral equation : @xmath20 .",
    "in the quasi - potential framework @xcite , @xmath21 can be rewritten in terms of two coupled equations t(k)=w(k)+w(k )  g_aux(k )  t(k ) where the effective interaction @xmath22 , in turn , is a solution of w(k)=v(k)+v(k )  _ 0(k )  w(k ) [ qp2 ] with @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is a smart choice to speed up the convergence of the iterative solutions .",
    "in eq . ( [ me4d ] ) the 4d integration contains all the difficulty given by the very complicated analytic structure of both bs amplitudes and em vertex in minkowski space . the adopted strategy for decreasing the degree of difficulty ,",
    "is based on disentangling the `` dynamical '' variable , i.e. the time , from the remaining three kinematical variables , that describe the `` initial '' state . in order to accomplish such a task",
    ", the lf kinematics appears a very appealing tool ( see , e.g. @xcite for an extensive review ) since the lf combination of the poincar generators has the property to produce the maximal numbers of generators without interaction ( 7 out of 10 ) . in turn",
    ", such a property produces many other relevant features , like the kinematical nature of the lf boosts ( to be not confused with the standard boosts , a part the longitudinal one ) .",
    "in particular , the lf components of the 4-momentum and the scalar product are given by k^=k^0k_z , _",

    "[ proj1 ] therefore , the `` lf - time '' , @xmath27 , that labels the dynamical evolution ( as the standard `` t '' in the instant form of the relativistic hamiltonian ) , is constrained to its initial value , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , once the physical quantities are integrated over @xmath26 , they are constrained to live onto the lf hyperplane defined by @xmath28 .",
    "a crucial step for the lf projection is the separation of the fermion propagator in an on - shell term and in an instantaneous one , i.e i  s(k)= = + = i  s_on(k)+[proj2 ] where @xmath29 is the minus - component of @xmath30 , such that @xmath31 , and the second term leads to an instantaneous ( in lf time ! ) free propagation , since the formal fourier transform generates @xmath32 ( see eq .",
    "( [ proj1 ] ) ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that such a term makes the treatment of a fermionic system basically different from the treatment of a bosonic one . on the other hand , the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ proj2 ] ) suggests a strategy for achieving our goal of an exact 3d reduction . as a matter of fact ,",
    "let us define the 4d on - shell two - body green s function @xcite ^on_0(k ) : = s_on(k_1 )  s_on(k - k_1 ) [ proj3 ] that plays a key role in our approach , since allows us to separate the _ trivial _ 4d propagation associated to such a contribution .",
    "the 3d lf counterpart of @xmath33 is introduced by integrating over @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. by projecting onto the 3d lf hyperplane , the following matrix elements ( note that the other three components of the momentum remain operators ) g_0(k)=  ^on_0(k )  ^+ dk_1 ^ -dk_1 ^ -k_1 ^ -| g^on_0(k)| k_1 ^ - where @xmath36 is a suitable kinematical factor ensuring the kinematical poincar covariance ( e.g. @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) , and the symbol @xmath39 , from now on , indicates the integration over the minus component of the 4-momentum that appears on the left or on the right side , depending upon the position of the symbol itself .    in the case without interaction , it is easy to find the relation between the 3d lf free state , @xmath40 , solution of @xmath41 ( note that instantaneous terms do not contribute ) and the free bs amplitude , solution of @xmath42 ( note that the particles are on their own mass - shell in the free case ) .",
    "it turns out @xcite that    the _ free reverse lf projector _ , that allows to jump from a 3d description to a 4d world . the operator @xmath43 has a simple explicit expression @xcite in terms of the positive energy dirac projector .",
    "let us remind that , by construction @xmath44 : this completes the reconstruction pattern in the simple case of a free two - fermion system .",
    "in order to apply the projection technique to the qp approach , namely for an interacting case , one needs an intermediate step , given by a suitable choice for the auxiliary green s function to be used in the 4d operator @xmath45 , see eq .",
    "( [ qp2 ] ) .",

    "the equation for @xmath22 can be solved by iteration , i.e. w(k)=v(k )  _ i=1^^i-1  .",
    "[ iter ] the rate of convergence of this series is related to @xmath48 , that describes the difference between the intermediate propagation of two non - interacting fermions and the 4d counterpart of the lf propagator @xmath46 . depending upon the powers of @xmath48 , we will have intermediate states with more and more bosons and fermions ( once we introduce time - ordered diagrams ) .",
    "the rosetta stone relating 4d and 3d quantities , is readily constructed .",
    "the 3d t - matrix and effective interaction are respectively t(k)=_0(k )  t(k )  _ 0(k ) w(k)=_0(k )  w(k )  _ 0(k )  .",
    "once @xmath49 is reexpressed in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath50 , one can introduce the 3d interacting green s function and its inverse as follows g(k)=g_0(k)+g_0(k)t(k)g_0(k ) g^-1(k ) = _ 0(k )  g^-1(k )  ( k ) where the _ interacting lf reverse projection operator _ is ( k)=   _ 0(k )  .    the solution @xmath51 of the following 3d equation , g^-1(k ) | =  | = 0 with appropriate boundary conditions for bound and scattering states ,",
    "is the valence component of the lf wave function for two interacting fermions , as can be deduced by the relation with the bs amplitude , shown in what follows .",
    "the exact relations between the 3d valence component and the 4d bs amplitude can be readily obtained , and they are given by | = ( k )  | g^on_0(k )  g^-1_0(k )   | =   |  .",
    "[ 3d4d]the rightmost equation illustrates the motivation for calling @xmath51 valence component , given the presence of the integration on the minus component in lhs ( see , e.g @xcite and references quoted therein ) .",
    "such an integration makes only the first component of the fock decomposition of @xmath52 to survive .",
    "a possible approximation scheme is suggested by the qp expansion of the effective interaction , eq .",
    "( [ iter ] ) . then , @xmath50 , @xmath49 and the 3d lf green s function @xmath53 ( all containing @xmath22 in a more or less explicit way ) can be evaluated by truncating the expansion at a given order . it should be pointed out that the full complexity of the fock - space affects @xmath53 through the effective interaction @xmath50 , as can be seen through a time - ordered analysis of the diagrams associated to each contribution @xmath54^{i-1}$ ] , and reminding that @xmath48 describes propagation . indeed , the truncation of the qp expansion limits the number of fock states involved in the construction of the effective interaction . as a final remark",
    ", one could argue that the convergence rate of the qp expansion is related to the small probability of the higher fock - components .",
