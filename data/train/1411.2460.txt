    "zero - point oscillations in the vacuum of quantized matter fields that are subject to boundary conditions have been studied intensively over more than six decades since h.b.g.casimir @xcite predicted a force between grounded metal plates , see reviews in @xcite .",
    "the existence of this force is one of the few macroscopic manifestations of quantum theory , together with other remarkable phenomena such as superfluidity , superconductivity , kaon and neutrino oscillations , spectrum of black - body radiation .",
    "the casimir force between material boundaries has now been measured quite accurately , it agrees with theoretical predictions , see , e.g. , @xcite , as well as other publications cited in @xcite , and this opens a way for various applications in modern nanotechnology .",
    "the casimir force is closely related to the van der waals force between material bodies at such separation distances ( @xmath2 ) that the retardation owing to the finiteness of the velocity of light becomes important . in view of this",
    ", it seems that the following two circumstances have to be clearly noted .",
    "the first one is that , as long as the intermolecular van der waals forces are attractive , almost all experimental measurements reveal the attractive casimir force ; an evidence for the repulsive casimir force has appeared just several years ago @xcite .",
    "the second one is that , as long as the intermolecular van der waals forces are due to electromagnetic fluctuations , the casimir effect is caused by zero - point oscillations in the vacuum of the quantized electromagnetic field .",
    "the casimir effect with other ( nonelectromagnetic ) quantized fields is mostly regarded as merely an academic exercise that could hardly be validated in laboratory . however , the nonelectromagnetic fields can be charged , and this opens a new prospect allowing one to consider the casimir effect as that caused by zero - point oscillations in the vacuum of quantized charged matter fields in the presence of material boundaries and a background ( classical ) electromagnetic field inside the quantization volume . whether the casimir effect of this kind is attractive or repulsive  we shall get an answer in the present paper .",
    "let us start by recalling that the effect of the background uniform electromagnetic field alone on the vacuum of quantized charged matter was studied long ago , see @xcite and review in @xcite .",
    "the case of a background field filling the whole ( infinite ) space is hard to be regarded as realistic , whereas the case of a background field confined to the bounded quantization volume for charged matter looks much more plausible , it can even be regarded as realizable in laboratory .",
    "moreover , there is no way to detect the energy density which is induced in the vacuum in the first case , whereas the pressure from the vacuum onto the boundary , resulting in the second case , is in principle detectable .",
    "one may suggest intuitively that the pressure , at least in certain circumstances , is positive , i.e. directed from the inside to the outside of the quantization volume .",
    "a natural question is then , whether the pressure depends on a boundary condition imposed on the quantized charged matter field at the boundary ?",
    "thus , an issue of a choice of boundary conditions acquires a primary importance , requiring a thorough examination .",
    "it should be recalled that , in the conventional case of the casimir effect with the quantized electromagnetic field , there exist physical motivations for different boundary conditions , for instance , corresponding to metallic or dielectric plates , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "such motivations seem to be lacking for the case of quantized charged matter fields , but it was not distressing as long as this case , as we have already mentioned , was regarded as a purely academic one . otherwise , in a situation which is supposed to be physically sensible , one should be guided by general principles , such as comprehensiveness and mathematical consistency , while seeking out boundary conditions .",
    "namely , in the context of first - quantized theory , a quest is for the operator of a physical observable to be self - adjoint rather than hermitian .",
    "this is stipulated by the mere fact that a multiple action is well defined for the self - adjoint operator only , allowing for the construction of functions of the operator , such as evolution , resolvent , zeta - function and heat kernel operators , with further implications upon second quantization . whether the quest can be fulfilled",
    "successfully is in general determined by the weyl ",
    "von neumann theory of self - adjoint operators , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "thus , the requirement of the self - adjointness for the operator of one - particle energy ( dirac hamiltonian operator in the case of quantized relativistic spinor fields ) renders the most general set of boundary conditions , which may be further restricted by additional physical considerations .    to avoid a misunderstanding ,",
    "let us emphasize once more that quantized matter fields are assumed to be confined within the boundaries , and an issue of what is out of the boundaries is not touched upon . in a sense , this setup is the same as that in modeling hadrons as bags containing the quark matter , see @xcite . in distinction to the conventional setup for the casimir effect , the impact of background fields on confined quantized matter fields is added along the lines discussed above .",
    "this generalization implies that the boundaries perceive an additional physical meaning , serving as a source of background fields which are inside the quantization volume .",
    "in the present paper , we consider the casimir effect in the generalized setup for a quantized charged spinor matter field in the background of an external uniform magnetic field ; both the quantized and external fields are confined between two parallel plates , and the external field is orthogonal to the plates .",
    "it should be noted that a similar problem has been studied more than a decade ago @xcite in a setup which is somewhat closer to the conventional setup for the casimir effect .",
    "namely , the authors of @xcite assume that both the quantized and external fields are not confined between the plates but extend outside ; the plates in their setup are regarded as the places where constraints on quantized fields are imposed , rather than as the real boundaries of the quantization volume .",
    "one of the purposes of the present paper is to compare the results obtained in these two different physical situations .",
    "according to @xcite , there is no room for the validation of the aforementioned intuitive suggestion : the pressure in all circumstances is negative , i.e. the plates are attracted . on the contrary , by studying a response of the vacuum of the confined quantized spinor matter field on the external magnetic field with the strength lines terminating at the plates , i shall show that , in the case of a sufficiently strong magnetic field and a sufficiently large separation of the plates , the pressure from the vacuum onto the plates is positive , being independent of the choice of a boundary condition and even of the distance between the plates .    in the next section we consider in general the problem of the self - adjointness for the dirac hamiltonian operator . in section 3",
    "we discuss the vacuum energy which is induced by an external uniform magnetic field and compare the appropriate expressions for the cases of the unbounded quantization volume and the quantization volume bounded by two parallel plates . a condition determining the spectrum of wave number vector in the direction of the magnetic field",
    "is chosen in section 4 .",
    "expressions for the casimir energy and force are obtained in section 5 .",
    "the conclusions are drawn and discussed in section 6 .",
    "some details of the derivation of results are given in appendices a and b.",
    "defining a scalar product as @xmath3 we get , using integration by parts , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the formal expression for the dirac hamiltonian operator in an external electromagnetic field ( natural units @xmath7 are used ) , @xmath8 is a two - dimensional surface bounding the three - dimensional spatial region @xmath9 .",
    "operator @xmath10 is hermitian ( or symmetric in mathematical parlance ) , @xmath11 if @xmath12 it is almost evident that the latter condition can be satisfied by imposing different boundary conditions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "but , a nontrivial task is to find a possibility that a boundary condition for @xmath14 is the same as that for @xmath13 ; then the domain of definition of @xmath15 ( set of functions @xmath14 ) coincides with that of @xmath10 ( set of functions @xmath13 ) , and operator @xmath10 is called self - adjoint . the action of a self - adjoint operator results in functions belonging to its domain of definition only , and , therefore , a multiple action and functions of such an operator can be consistently defined .",
    "condition ( 4 ) is certainly fulfilled when the integrand in ( 4 ) vanishes , i.e. @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the unit normal which may be chosen as pointing outward to the boundary . to fulfill the latter condition",
    ", we impose the same boundary condition for @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a matrix ( element of the clifford algebra ) which is determined by two conditions : @xmath20 and @xmath21 using the standard representation for @xmath22-matrices , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the pauli matrices ) , one can get @xmath26 where condition @xmath27 defines @xmath28 as a rank-2 matrix depending on four arbitrary parameters @xcite .",
    "an explicit form for matrix @xmath19 is @xmath29 where @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is a two - dimensional vector which is tangential to the boundary .",
    "hence , the boundary condition ensuring the self - adjointness of operator @xmath10 ( 2 ) is written explicitly as @xmath32 @xmath33\\biggr\\}\\chi|_{\\mathbf{r}\\in \\partial{\\omega}}=0 \\eqno(13)\\ ] ] ( the same condition is for @xmath14 ) , where @xmath34_{+}= [ \\boldsymbol{n}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\gamma},\\,\\gamma^2]_{+}=[\\gamma^1,\\gamma^2]_{+}=0 , \\eqno(14)\\ ] ] and we have employed parametrization @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 parameters of the boundary condition , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , can be interpreted as the self - adjoint extension parameters .",
    "it should be noted that , in addition to ( 5 ) , the following combination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is also vanishing at the boundary : @xmath42[i\\cosh\\vartheta-\\boldsymbol{n}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\gamma^{5}\\sinh\\vartheta\\cos\\theta\\ ] ] @xmath43\\chi|_{\\mathbf{r}\\in \\partial{\\omega}}=0.\\eqno(16)\\ ] ]    clearly , parametrization ( 15 ) is relevant for the case of @xmath44 only .",
    "the case of @xmath45 corresponds to the imaginary values of @xmath39 : @xmath46 , @xmath47 . at @xmath48",
    "one obtains the well - known mit bag boundary condition @xcite , see reviews in @xcite : @xmath49 and relation ( 16 ) takes form @xmath50 the case of @xmath51 is hard to be regarded as physically acceptable , since a link to the mit bag boundary condition is lacking .",
    "it should be noted that , in the case of the two - dimensional dirac - weyl hamiltonian operator emerging in the framework of the tight - binding model description of long - wavelength electronic excitations in graphene , the most general boundary condition is also four - parametric @xcite , but the @xmath19-matrix is chosen to be hermitian in this case .    returning to the case of operator @xmath10 ( 2 ) , we note that , if the boundary is disconnected , consisting of several connected components , @xmath52 , then there are four ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ) self - adjoint extension parameters corresponding to each of the components , @xmath57 .",
    "however , if some symmetry is present , then the number of self - adjoint extension parameters can be diminished .",
    "for instance , let us consider spatial region @xmath9 which is bounded by two noncompact noncontiguous surfaces , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "choosing coordinates @xmath60 in such a way that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are tangential to the boundary , while @xmath63 is normal to it , we identify the position of @xmath64 with , say , @xmath65 .",
    "if region @xmath9 is invariant under rotations around a normal to the boundary surfaces ( that is the case of a region bounded by parallel planes ) , then the boundary condition should be independent of the components of the @xmath66-vector , which are tangential to the boundary , i.e. @xmath67 operator @xmath10 ( 2 ) acting on functions which are defined in such a region is self - adjoint if condition @xmath68\\chi|_{z=\\pm{a/2}}=0 , \\eqno(20)\\ ] ] holds ( with the same condition holding for @xmath14 ) .",
    "the latter ensures the fulfilment of constraint @xmath69 as well as of relation @xmath70 ( i\\cosh\\vartheta_{\\pm } \\mp { \\gamma}^3\\gamma^{5}\\sinh\\vartheta_{\\pm})\\chi|_{z=\\pm{a/2}}=0 . \\eqno(22)\\ ] ]",

    "the sums and the integral in the last line on the right - hand side of ( 83 ) [ which are due to the terms in the last line on the right - hand side of ( 80 ) and which can be interpreted as describing the proper energies of the boundary planes containing the sources of the magnetic field ] are divergent , but this divergency is of no concern for us , because it has no physical consequences . rather than the generalized casimir energy ,",
    "a physically relevant quantity is the generalized casimir force which is defined as @xmath227 and which is free from divergencies .",
    "we obtain @xmath228 where @xmath229 @xmath230{\\rm e}^{2{\\kappa}a}-\\left(\\kappa\\cosh\\vartheta - m\\right)^{2 } } { \\left[\\left(\\kappa\\cosh\\vartheta+m\\right){\\rm e}^{2{\\kappa}a}+\\kappa\\cosh\\vartheta - m\\right]^{2}}.\\eqno(87)\\ ] ]    it should be noted that limit @xmath231 for @xmath232 ( 86 ) is smooth [ i.e. the limiting value coincides with the result obtained with the use of ( 79 ) ] .",
    "thus , for a particular choice of the boundary condition yielding spectrum @xmath233 @xmath234 , we obtain @xmath235 and , using integration by parts , @xmath236 the integral in ( 88 ) can be taken after expanding the factor with denominator as @xmath237 . in this way",

    "the case of @xmath242 , as was already mentioned , is formally equivalent to the case of a massless spinor field , @xmath208 ; however , it has to be kept in mind that the @xmath38-independent piece of the casimir force , @xmath243 , diverges in the limit of @xmath244 , see ( 40 ) .",
    "note also that the antiperiodic boundary condition , @xmath245 ( the same condition is for @xmath14 ) , ensures the self - adjointness of the dirac hamiltonian operator , but current ( 52 ) does not vanish at the boundary : instead , the influx of the quantized matter at one boundary surface equals the outflux of the quantized matter at the other boundary surface .",
    "the spectrum of the wave number vector which is orthogonal to the boundary is @xmath246 @xmath247 , and the casimir energy and force take forms @xmath248 and @xmath249 respectively , or , in the alternative representation , @xmath250 and @xmath251.\\eqno(96)\\ ] ]",
    "in the present paper , we have considered the influence of a background uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on the vacuum of a quantized charged spinor matter field confined between two parallel plates separated by distance @xmath222 .",
    "if the magnetic field is directed orthogonally to the plates and the normal component of the current of quantized matter is assumed to vanish at the plates , then the dirac hamiltonian operator is self - adjoint under a set of boundary conditions depending on four arbitrary functions of two coordinates which are tangential to the plates . ignoring this functional dependence and restricting ourselves to the case",
    "when the spectrum of the wave number vector along the magnetic field is independent of the number of the landau level , see ( 76 ) , we arrive at a set of boundary conditions depending on one parameter , @xmath38 , see ( 77 ) . under these circumstances",

    "we can conclude that the heisenberg - euler term , @xmath270 ( 40 ) , is dominating at a relatively large separation of the plates , @xmath271 , at a nonweak magnetic field . since the right - hand side of ( 40 ) is negative , the casimir force in this case , @xmath272 , is repulsive ( the pressure from the vacuum onto the plates is positive ) , being independent of the choice of boundary conditions at the plates , as well as of the distance between the plates . in the opposite case of a relatively small separation of the plates , @xmath273 , at a sufficiently weak magnetic field , @xmath274 , the heisenberg - euler term is negligible , and the casimir force is attractive , being power dependent on the distance between the plates , see ( 100 ) and ( 105 ) .",
    "we remind that the results for the case of the mit bag boundary condition are obtained at @xmath211 , while the results for the case of the antiperiodic boundary condition are obtained at @xmath242 by change @xmath275 .",
    "let us compare our results with those of the authors of @xcite . as was already mentioned in introduction",
    ", these authors assume that both the quantized and external fields are not confined within the plates . due to this circumstance ,",
    "the heisenberg - euler - term contribution to the casimir effect is absent in their approach . as to the remaining part , it is calculated in the cases of the antiperiodic boundary condition @xcite and the mit bag boundary condition @xcite ; our results for @xmath276 in these particular cases agree with the results in @xcite .",
    "note also that the casimir effect with a quantized charged scalar matter field in the background of an external uniform magnetic field has been comprehensively analyzed in @xcite .",
    "usually , the casimir effect is validated experimentally for the separation of parallel plates to be of order of @xmath277 , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite .",
    "so , even if one takes the lightest charged particle , electron ( the compton wavelength , @xmath278 , equals @xmath279 ) , then it becomes clear that the limiting case of @xmath280 [ which is appropriate to ( 100 ) and ( 105 ) , when constants @xmath281 and @xmath282 are recovered ] has no relation to physics reality .",
    "in the realistic case of @xmath283 the casimir force is prevailed by the heisenberg - euler term , @xmath284 , since the corrections depending on the separation distance and boundary conditions are exponentially damped , see ( 99 ) and ( 103 ) .",
    "thus , in the limit of a strong magnetic field , @xmath285 , we obtain @xmath286 where constants @xmath281 and @xmath282 are recovered , and @xmath287 equals @xmath288 .",
    "such supercritical magnetic fields may be attainable in some astrophysical objects , such as neutron stars and magnetars @xcite , and also gamma - ray bursters in scenarios involving protomagnetars @xcite ; the proper account for the influence of casimir pressure ( 106 ) on physical processes in these objects should be taken .",
    "supercritical magnetic fields are not feasible in terrestrial laboratories where the maximal values of steady magnetic fields are of order of @xmath289 , see , e.g. , @xcite . in the case of a subcritical magnetic field , @xmath290 , we obtain by rewriting ( 97 ) : @xmath291 let us compare this with the attractive casimir force which is due to the quantized electromagnetic field @xcite , @xmath292 and define ratio @xmath293 at @xmath294 and @xmath295 the attraction is prevailing over the repulsion by six orders of magnitude , @xmath296 , and the casimir force is @xmath297 .",
    "however , at @xmath298 and @xmath295 the repulsion becomes dominant over the attraction by two orders of magnitude , @xmath299 and the casimir force takes value @xmath300 .",
    "otherwise , the same value of the casimir force is achieved at @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "thus , an experimental observation of the influence of the background magnetic field on the casimir pressure seems to be possible in a foreseen future in terrestrial laboratories .",
