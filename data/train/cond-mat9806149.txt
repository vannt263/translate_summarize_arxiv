    "the properties of the two  dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , subject to a strong magnetic field applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2deg , may be interpreted in terms of particles similar to electrons which experience a weak effective magnetic field ",
    "they interact with each other not only through the coulomb interaction but also via a chern  simons potential which couples the particle density to the particle current .",
    "the chern  simons theory of these composite fermions ( cfs )  @xcite has been used extensively to understand the properties of the 2deg in the fractional quantum hall regime ( fqhr ) . in particular , the fractional quantum hall effect exhibited by the electron gas is understood to be a manifestation of the underlying integer quantum hall effect of the cf gas ; the relation between the filling factor of the electron system @xmath0 and that of the cf system @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 at filling factors of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is an integer , the cfs experience zero effective magnetic field and the cf excitation spectrum is gapless : the 2deg is compressible .",
    "various experiments have been performed on the 2deg in the fqhr which seem to be in agreement with the cf theory ,  @xcite such as those experiments involving surface acoustic waves ,  @xcite magnetotransport measurements  @xcite and experiments in which electrons tunnel into the 2deg .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we examine the properties of the 2deg within the cf model in order to calculate the response of the cf system to the sudden appearance of a localized charge .",
    "we show how this charge may be used to probe the charge",
    " density excitation spectrum of the 2deg , and propose an experiment which obtains this information directly .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : qdgf ] we show how the sudden appearance of the probe charge near to the 2deg affects the spectral function of the probe .",
    "we derive the dependence of the spectral function on the excitation spectrum of the 2deg , i.e. the dynamic structure factor .",
    "in particular , we show that the probe spectral function will depend on whether or not there is a gap to excitations : the spectral function may exhibit an orthogonality catastrophe if the system is gapless , but will not do so when there is a gap .    section  [ sect : eds ] calculates the dynamic structure factor @xmath5 for the 2deg at even ",
    "denominator filling factors using the theory of cfs in zero effective field ; the modified random phase approximation ( mrpa ) is used .",
    "we compare this with a similar calculation for electrons in zero real field , and find that the cf system in zero effective field has a much higher number of low energy excitations than does the electron gas at zero real field .",
    "we then derive the fluctuations in the charge density induced by the sudden appearance of the probe charge and find that the relaxation time of the fluctuations is much greater in the cf gas than in the electron gas because of the larger number of excitations . finally in this section , we derive the spectral function of the probe charge along the lines of sec .",
    "[ sect : qdgf ] utilizing the calculated dynamic structure factors .",
    "the cf system is shown to exhibit an orthogonality catastrophe which is more severe than that of the electron gas : the reason for this is related to the number of low  energy excitations in each system .    in sec .",
    "[ sect : ods ] , the calculations from sec .",
    "[ sect : eds ] are generalized to cfs in finite effective fields @xmath6 and 10 which map onto the 2deg at @xmath7 , 3/7 , 7/15 and 10/21 .",
    "there is a gap to excitations , therefore there is no orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "we find that the probe spectral function has oscillations , the envelope of which approaches the shape of the spectral function at @xmath8 as the effective field tends to zero .",
    "moreover , these oscillations have a period equal to the effective cyclotron energy at the appropriate filling factor .    in sec .",
    "[ sect : tunneling ] we propose an experiment in which a 2deg in the fqhr is probed by the sudden appearance of an electron in a quantum dot situated a distance @xmath9 above the plane of the 2deg .",
    "electrons in a source lead are allowed to tunnel resonantly into a quantum dot which is kept at a fixed energy ; this dot acts as a monochromator .",
    "the electron is then allowed to tunnel into a second quantum dot which is situated a small distance @xmath9 above the plane of the 2deg ; the energy of this probe dot relative to the monochromator dot is controlled by a gate voltage .",
    "as soon as the electron appears in the dot , excitations are created in the 2deg to screen the probe ; the energy required by the electron to do this is manifest as broadening of the dot spectral function to higher energies .",
    "the current is proportional to the density of states at the energy of the monochromator dot , hence measuring the current as a function of the voltage difference between the two dots will give the spectral function of the probe dot coupled to the 2deg . as the results in secs .",
    "[ sect : eds ]  and  [ sect : ods ] imply , one should be able to detect the presence of compressible states at even ",

    "section  [ sect : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the quantum dot is assumed to have an unperturbed energy @xmath10 and interacts with the cfs only when it is present .",
    "since there can not be more than one quantum dot , the quantum dot operators @xmath9 and @xmath11 are fermionic , i.e. they anticommute .",

    "the spectral function at @xmath29 is in fact proportional to @xmath30 . since @xmath31 is the lowest  energy perturbed 2deg eigenstate the spectral function has a threshold frequency of @xmath32 below which it is identically zero .",
    "the difference @xmath33 can also be thought of as a renormalisation of the quantum dot energy by writing @xmath34 .",

    "this has very important consequences when probing systems by introducing a localized potential .",

    "@xcite    2 having identified the formal properties of the green s function , in a real calculation one usually starts from a position where the perturbed ( i.e. tilded ) eigenstates are not known .",

    "hence , the two states are orthogonal and there will be an orthogonality catastrophe . the criterion for @xmath67 not to have an infra - red divergence is either that the system has a gap to excitations , in which case the convergence is trivial , or that the low energy behaviour of the density of pair excitations has a stronger than linear dependence . for low @xmath71 ; there is usually a cut - off @xmath72 in the excitation spectrum which , for electrons , is of order the fermi energy .",
    "@xcite thus there is no ultraviolet divergence .",

    "simons terms .",
    "there are two clear features in each of figs .",
    "[ fig : struc1/2 ]  and  [ fig : strucelec ] .",
    "the first is the dominant central structure which is the contribution from the pair continuum .",
    "since the calculation is essentially of an rpa type , it includes only single pair excitations .",
    "@xcite an excitation created with a momentum @xmath113 involves the transition of one particle from an occupied to an unoccupied state .",
    "the rpa or mrpa structure factor is obtained by allowing for the interactions between this particle  hole pair .",
    "multipair excitations with momentum @xmath113 involve simultaneous transitions of more than one particle from occupied to unoccupied states , which are not accounted for in the rpa .",

    "[ fig : struc1/2 ]  and  [ fig : strucelec ] is that , at low energies and momentum , @xmath117 is much larger in the cf system at @xmath76 than it is for the electron system at @xmath112 . since the only difference between the cfs and the electrons is that the cfs interact via the chern ",
    "simons potential as well as the coulomb potential , the greater number of low energy and momentum excitations is attributable to scattering by the chern  simons field . as a result ,",
    "the screening properties of the cf liquid are quite different from those of the electron liquid , and this has a marked effect on the response to applied potentials , as will be shown later .    the second feature in figs .",
    "[ fig : struc1/2 ]  and  [ fig : strucelec ] is the black line in the @xmath118 plane which appears to the right of the pair continuum .",
    "this is the collective mode , which for the cfs is the cyclotron mode , and for the electrons is the plasmon mode .",
    "the contribution to the structure factor is not plotted , since it is a delta  function singularity along the mode with a weight many times larger than that of the pair continuum .",
    "the collective mode is identified as the locus of points ( x , y ) for which the denominator of the density  density correlation function @xmath119 vanishes .",
    "@xcite for a given momentum , the pole in frequency is found to lie on the real axis .",
    "however , because of causality the poles are pushed just slightly below the real axis .",
    "the structure factor coming from this mode is found to be @xmath120 where res@xmath121 is the residue of @xmath122 and the mode has dispersion @xmath123 .",
    "expanding the denominator of @xmath119 for low @xmath114 but finite @xmath115 leads to the following equations for the collective mode @xmath124 thus kohn s theorem is obeyed for cfs because , in the limit @xmath125 , the pole occurs at the cyclotron energy @xmath126 the plasmon mode for the electrons at @xmath112 is found to be gapless and varies as the square  root of the momentum , as it should in two dimensions .",
    "@xcite    an expansion of the denominator of @xmath119 for low @xmath127 and @xmath114 reveals that the cf spectrum also has a diffusive mode , i.e. the pole in the complex frequency plane lies on the imaginary axis .",
    "@xcite in fact , in this regime one finds that @xmath128 which clearly has a pole at @xmath129 , where @xmath130 .",
    "this is a diffusive mode , since it is the dispersion relation for normal modes of the diffusion equation @xmath131    one of the consequences of the equation of continuity is that the dynamic structure factor must satisfy the f  sum rule  @xcite @xmath132 and it was found that the sum rule is satisfied to within a fraction of one percent .",
    "this is as expected since the mrpa has been designed to ensure that the f  sum rule is satisfied .",
    "it therefore represents an excellent check of the numerical algorithms .",
    "the diffusive mode becomes evident when one considers the charged induced by an external potential as a function of time and distance from its source .",
    "the linear response theory can only be applied if the potential is weak ; we note that it is well  known that the total particle density surrounding the potential calculated in linear response may become negative if the potential is strongly repulsive  @xcite .",
    "since this is obviously a non  physical result , one must be careful in applying linear response theory for very strong potentials . in order to use the cf theory as it stands",
    ", any probe of the 2deg must be a relatively weak perturbation .",
    "therefore , in this article the potential is assumed to result from an electron being placed in a quantum dot of size @xmath133 at a distance @xmath9 above the plane of the 2deg .",
    "here @xmath133 and @xmath9 are both taken to be 5 nm for the purposes of illustration ; these values are physically acceptable but can obviously be varied according to specific device design .",
    "the 2deg density is @xmath134 . within linear response ,",
    "the general equation for the charge density induced is  @xcite @xmath135 in this case , the potential due to the charge in the quantum dot is @xmath136 utilizing the dynamic structure factor , and fourier transforming in time , yields @xmath137 within the diffusive mode approximation , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq : diffmode ] ) , the charge induced in the 2deg builds up with time as @xmath138 where the characteristic time @xmath139 diverges in the long wavelength limit .",
    "thus the system takes a long time to relax to the static density .",
    "figures  [ fig : cdens1/2 ]  and  [ fig : cdenselec ] show the complete particle density as a function of the in  plane distance from the dot and the time since the charging of the dot .",
    "they clearly show that the electron system at @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cdenselec ] ) responds much more quickly than does a cf liquid at @xmath76 , because the abundance of low energy cf excitations means the induced charge continues to fluctuate at very long time scales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cdens1/2 ] ) .",
    "the dynamic structure is clearly seen to have a large effect on the screening properties of the 2deg ; the higher numbers of low energy excitations in the cf liquid at @xmath76 imply that the charge density takes a longer time to settle to a constant value than for the electron liquid at @xmath112 .",
    "the mnd theory  @xcite reviewed in section  [ sect : qdgf ] shows that it is also the low energy excitations which determine the shape of the quantum dot spectral function , i.e. its density of states .",
    "figure  [ fig : rho ] shows the calculated density of pair excitations created by the dot potential  ( [ eq : dotpotential ] ) for the electrons at @xmath8 , i.e. cfs at @xmath76 , and for electrons at @xmath112 .",
    "the figure shows that the density of low energy excitations @xmath50 coupling to the potential is much greater for cfs at @xmath76 than for electrons at @xmath112 ; this is a consequence of the relative dynamic structure factors .",
    "the mnd theory  @xcite shows that it is the low energy behaviour of @xmath50 which is crucial for determining the dot spectral function .",
    "analysis of the very low energy spectrum using a log  log plot reveals that while in the case of electron at @xmath112 @xmath140 , the density of pair excitations in the cf system at @xmath76 is found to behave as @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "consequently , the total number of excitations @xmath67 created in the cf gas at @xmath76 is more strongly divergent than the logarithmically  divergent number excited in the electron gas at @xmath112 .",
    "this is reflected in the quantum dot spectral functions plotted in fig .",

[ fig : spec ] is completely different , being suppressed and not divergent close to threshold . since the integral of the spectral function must be conserved  @xcite , the low energy weight is transferred to higher energies and is manifest as a peak centred near 0.15 v@xmath148 .",
    "this transfer of the weight is again a consequence of the far higher number of low energy pair excitations found in the cf system at @xmath76 than in the electron gas at @xmath112 .",

    "an excitation involves removing a cf from a given occupied landau level and putting it in an unoccupied level ; this pair excitation is charge neutral , hence it has a well  defined momentum .",
    "the pair carries a dipole moment which is proportional to the momentum ,  @xcite and since this affects the overlap of the charge wavefunctions it is clear that the interaction energy is affected by the momentum .",

    "second , the spectrum is esentially discrete , resulting from the gaps between landau levels .",
    "near to a turning point in the excitation spectrum , the density of states has the one  dimensional inverse square  root behaviour .",
    "therefore , the density of pair excitations at this energy has a singular contribution .",
    "since in a real system the landau levels would have some broadening , the spectra shown have been generated by convolution of the bare spectra with a narrow  width lorentzian ; the actual value of the width is unimportant as long as the spectrum is evaluated at energies with a separation much smaller than the linewidth .",
    "third , as the effective magnetic field is reduced , the envelope of the spectrum tends towards the shape of that at @xmath8 .",
    "consequently , one should expect the spectral function to exhibit similar behaviour .",
    "the quantum dot spectral functions are plotted in figs .  [ fig : spec1/3][fig : spec10/21 ] as a function of energy above threshold in units of the coulomb energy .",
    "it should be noted that there is a finite weight below the threshold where one would suspect there should be none .",
    "this is simply a result of convolving the bare spectral function , due solely to creation of the pairs , with a narrow width lorentzian .",
    "since the excitation spectrum has a gap , the number of pair excitations @xmath67 created is not divergent , and therefore there is no orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : specexpansion ] ) shows that there will be a finite probability of creating no excitations at all , which is manifest as a delta  function peak at threshold with weight @xmath59 . since there will be a limiting resolution in any experiment designed to measure the quantum dot density of states , it is appropriate to apply a broadening , which in this case is of order 0.1 mev",
    "this is comparable to the effective cyclotron energy for the given density at @xmath167 , thus the detail in the spectrum at this filling factor is poorly resolved , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec10/21 ] . however , the structure in the spectra for the states @xmath168 and @xmath169 is resolved ; in each of the figs .  [",
    "fig : spec1/3][fig : spec7/15 ] , one may clearly see an oscillation with a period equal to the effective cyclotron energy .",
    "this result is simply a consequence of the gaps in the excitation spectra .",
    "the evolution of the spectrum as the real magnetic field , and hence the effective field , is reduced ( figs .  [",
    "fig : spec1/3][fig : spec10/21 ] ) is easily explained by the change in density of pair excitations ( figs .",
    "[ fig : rho1/3][fig : rho10/21 ] ) . for a system with a gap",
    ", there is no orthogonality catastrophe , therefore there is a finite spectral weight at threshold .",
    "the expansion of the spectral function eq .",

    "( a diverging @xmath67 is indicative of a catastrophe ) . as the field",
    "is reduced , the energy gap decreases in size and the average number of excitations increases , hence the weight at threshold decreases .",
    "this feature is obvious from figs .",
    "[ fig : spec1/3][fig : spec10/21 ] .",
    "however what is perhaps more interesting is that as the field is reduced , the spectrum quickly develops a low energy suppression and a high energy peak , reminiscent of that at @xmath8 .",
    "this is attributable to the change in the density of pair excitations with field , which as already mentioned develops an envelope similar to @xmath50 at @xmath8 .",
    "however , the spectra also show the oscillations with period equal to the effective cyclotron energy superimposed on this envelope .",
    "a comparison with the results for ordinary electrons at the equivalent filling factors of @xmath170 and 10 is , at this point , informative . within the same level of approximation",
    "as used for the cfs , i.e. the ( m)rpa , the spectra have oscillations characteristic of the cyclotron energy similar to the case above of composite fermions .",
    "@xcite however , where the behaviour of the cf and electron spectra differ is in their respective low  field regimes .",
    "the threshold peak for the electrons does fall in value as the field is reduced , being the largest feature in the spectrum at @xmath164 and tending to zero as the field is switched off , hence giving the orthogonality catastrophe viewed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .",
    "however , it is still essentially peaked close to threshold , unlike in the cf case where a shift in weight is observed as the effective field is reduced from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "it should be noted that to discuss the @xmath164 state in such an approximation is at best naive and at worst incorrect .",
    "this is in precisely the range of filling factors where the electron  electron interaction causes the correlations associated with the fqhr , so the electron ",
    "electron interaction can not be treated as a weak perturbation . however , this is analogous to employing the mrpa for cfs at @xmath171 , and therefore , as a method of comparing electrons with cfs , this level of approximation is valid .",
    "as stated previously , a better approximation could be to extend the works of kallin and halperin  @xcite by using both the chern ",
    "simons and coulomb interactions .",
    "this point is not pursued here .",
    "in the previous section , it was shown how the neutral excitations of the 2deg may be probed by placing an electron into an quantum dot situated in the vicinity of the 2deg .",
    "the density of states of the quantum dot reflects the neutral excitation spectrum of the 2deg .",
    "the quantum dot spectral function is a purely theoretical construct , therefore it needs to be related to a quantity which is experimentally measurable . in metals ,",
    "inverse photoemission spectroscopy ( ips )  @xcite may be used to determine the neutral excitation spectrum of the conduction band because the density of states of a core atomic potential in a metal can be measured directly as the ips spectrum .",
    "however , it would not be easy to control the proximity of the core hole to the 2deg , so it is unlikely to be a useful method for measuring specifically the 2deg density of states .",
    "one possible scheme for bringing a local quantum dot close to the 2deg is to allow electrons from a lead to tunnel into a single energy level in an impurity state or quantum dot specially grown in the vicinity of the 2deg .",
    "an electron in the dot will interact with the 2deg and , as a consequence , the dot s density of states will broaden reflecting the creation of pair excitations . by keeping the energy of the tunneling electron fixed ,",
    "one may vary the energy of the dot by applying a gate voltage which brings different regions of the dot density of states into resonance with the tunneling electron .",
    "the current measured as a function of the gate voltage should be proportional to the dot spectral function at that energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : junction ] provides a schematic illustration of the proposed experiment .",
    "the lower portion shows the geometry , while the upper portion describes the energetics of the tunneling process .",
    "there is one feature which needs particular explanation , and this is the presence of two quantum dots . in general , the tunneling process takes an electron from the source lead .",
    "this electron can have a range of energies up to the fermi energy of the lead , and consequently without the presence of dot a the current would be proportional to the convolution of the density of states of the lead and that of dot b. hence the @xmath172@xmath38 profile in this case is not a direct measure of dot b s spectral function .",
    "the purpose of dot a is therefore to act as an electron monochromator , because only source electrons with energy @xmath64 can resonantly tunnel to a. an electron in a will resonantly tunnel to quantum dot b only if there are states available with energy @xmath64 . in the absence of the 2deg",
    "the density of states of b is a @xmath173function at energy @xmath72 , and tunneling occurs only when @xmath174 .",
    "however , the presence of the 2deg means that the density of states is asymmetrically broadened to higher energies due to the neutral excitations in the 2deg induced by the filled dot  this implies that tunneling can only occur if @xmath175 .",
    "the electron can then tunnel from dot b into the drain lead to be measured as a current , determined by the tunneling rates @xmath176 , and @xmath177 .",
    "the current @xmath172 is measured as a function of the gate voltage @xmath38 controlling the difference between the energy @xmath64 of the injected electron and the energy @xmath72 of dot b. this resonant tunneling is similar to ips with a zero energy photon , the analog of the ips spectrum being the tunneling i - v characteristic ; the threshold @xmath178 in this case is such that @xmath179 .",
    "generally , @xmath180 , hence the creation of excitations implies that the spectrum is non - zero for @xmath181 .",
    "once an electron has tunneled into dot b it must reside there for a time greater than the response time of the 2deg .",
    "this implies that the electron tunnels out with rate @xmath177 less than the desired resolution , which is typically the cf landau - level spacing for a filling factor close to @xmath8 .",
    "the other two rates @xmath182 and @xmath183 are determined by the following simple argument which will be justified later .",
    "the average current can be written as @xmath184 where @xmath43 is the total time taken to tunnel from source to drain . in terms of the tunneling rates we have for sequential tunneling @xmath185 in order for the tunneling current to reflect only the density of states of dot b , the conditions @xmath186 are chosen , in which case @xmath187 the rate of tunneling from a to b is designed to be slow , while that from b to the drain is large .",
    "tunneling from the source lead into dot a is arranged to be so fast that a may be considered to be essentially always full .",
    "therefore dot a may be regarded as though it is a lead with a lorentzian density of states .",
    "tunneling then occurs from this lead to the drain lead via a localized state in dot b. consequently one may use the tunneling hamiltonian approach  @xcite with a as the first lead and the drain as the second lead ; resonant tunneling occurs from the localized state b. since the tunneling rate out of b is very fast , it is the rate of tunneling _ into _ the dot which is of relevance when determining the current .",
    "the current is thus determined by the rate of change of the occupancy of dot b. the hamiltonian may be written @xmath188 where dot a has energy @xmath189 with operators @xmath190 and @xmath191 , while dot b has energy @xmath192 with operators @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "the 2deg is described by the hamiltonian @xmath195 , @xmath38 is the interaction of the dot with the 2deg , and the electron may hop between the dots with matrix element @xmath196 .",

    "2 .   the quantum dot must be far enough away from the 2deg so as to allow the linear response functions to be used , but not so far as to be too weak a perturbation to couple to the 2deg .",
    "this is controlled by the separation @xmath9 .",
    "the potential @xmath225 scales as @xmath226 , hence if @xmath9 is too large , the quantum dot does not couple effectively to the low energy excitations . in particular , the oscillations of the spectral function due to the landau level structure would not be seen .",
    "3 .   the quantum dot must also be relatively small in size otherwise the form factor @xmath227 destroys the structure of interest .",
    "4 .   related to the point above , the level separation in the dot must be much larger than the range of the density of states induced by the 2deg , which again requires a small dot .",
    "if this is not the case , the quantum dot can no longer be approximated as a single level system , and the mnd techniques are not applicable .",
    "the quantum dot may also influence and be influenced by the drain electrons , which means that the signal will be a convolution of the effect due to the 2deg with that due to the drain .",
    "this problem is minimized if the drain is kept sufficiently far enough from b , since the potential is short ranged .",
    "there is also the question of the barrier dimensions .",

    "we deduced the charge induced by a weak probe in the cf and electron gases at zero effective and real fields respectively within linear response and found that the greater number of excitations in the cf gas at @xmath76 causes the charge density of the cfs to fluctuate for a much longer time than it does in the electron gas at @xmath112 ; this is in agreement with the observation that the charge density relaxation time calculated using the single diffusive mode approximation diverges in the long  wavelength limit .",

    "this depends on the density of pair excitations created by the probe @xmath50 .",
    "according to the mnd theory , an orthogonality catastrophe is predicted if the excitation spectrum is gapless and the low  energy behaviour of @xmath50 is weaker than linear .",

    "it is found that the probe spectral function is now heavily suppressed at threshold . however , a cf gas in finite effective field has a gap to excitations , consequently there is no orthogonality catastrophe .",
    "the probe spectral function therefore has a @xmath62peak at threshold with a non  zero weight equal to the debye ",
    "waller factor .",
    "there is an oscillation in the spectral function which has a period equal to the effective cyclotron energy of the cfs ; the envelope of the oscillations becomes more like the shape of the spectral function in zero effective field as the effective field is reduced .",
    "our work shows that by measuring the spectral function of the probe one could determine the effective mass of the cfs as a function of field . to this end",
    ", we proposed an experiment which measures the spectral function of the probe directly .",
    "the probe is taken to be an electron in a quantum dot placed a distance @xmath9 above the plane of the 2deg .",
    "the sudden appearance of the electron in the dot is accomplished by a tunneling process .",
    "a two  dot device is proposed with the first dot acting as an energy filter and the second dot as the probe .",
    "an electron resonantly tunnels from a source lead into the first dot , then tunnels into the probe dot whereupon it interacts with the 2deg . after a time longer than the response time of the 2deg the electron tunnels out of the probe to a drain lead .",
    "the interaction broadens the density of states of the probe dot so that there is a finite tunneling probability proportional to the density of states at the energy of the monochromator dot .",
    "the difference between the energies of the two dots is controlled by the voltage difference between the dots , thus this voltage alters the density of states of the probe dot at the energy of the monochromator dot . since the current is proportional to this density of states , a plot of current through the device against gate voltage gives the spectral function of the probe dot resulting from the interaction of the dot with the 2deg .",
