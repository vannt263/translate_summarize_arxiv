    "the hot x - ray - emitting coronae around disk galaxies serve as a reservoir where galaxies acquire baryons to build up galactic disks and deposit kinetic energy and chemically - enriched materials .",
    "this x - ray emitting gas has been detected in various types of disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and can be globally reproduced by recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( @xcite ) , supporting the expected origin of galactic corona from feedback close to the galaxy ( @xcite ) , or maybe related to accretion of external gas at large galactocentric radii ( @xmath2 ; @xcite ) .    the coronal properties are observed to correlate with various galaxy properties ( @xcite ) . in particular , there is a tight correlation between the coronal soft x - ray luminosity and the total [ core collapsed ( cc)+type  ia ] supernova ( sn ) energy injection rate .",
    "the x - ray radiation efficiency ( the fraction of sn energy observed in the coronal x - ray emission ) is quite low ( @xmath3 ) , indicating that most of the feedback material is missing from a clear detection in soft x - ray ( @xcite ) . in galaxies rich in cool gas , a large fraction of the feedback energy",
    "may be radiated through the recombination line of warm ionized gas at a lower temperature ( @xmath4 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in early - type galaxy bulges which are typically poor in cool gas , the missing feedback material is most likely carried out to the intergalactic space by a galactic bulge wind mainly produced by type  ia sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the metal - enriched galactic feedback material is typically hot ( @xmath5 ) and has too low density ( @xmath6 ) to be directly detected in current x - ray observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus controversial what is the nature of the hot gas detected in soft x - ray around nearby galaxies : the real diffuse hot tenuous corona or just the mixed material at the interface of cool and hot gases ( e.g. , @xcite ) ? in order to understand the nature of this soft x - ray emission and to search for the missing galactic feedback material , we need to measure the metallicity of hot gas around isolated , moderate- or low - mass , early - type galaxies , which are weakly affected by the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , gravitational heating , or current star formation . however , existing x - ray observations of such galaxies often reveal a low fe ( a primary product of type  ia sn ) abundance , typically subsolar or slightly supersolar ( e.g. , @xcite ) , indicating that most of the sn ejecta is not detected .",
    "we herein present a deep _ suzaku _ observation of ngc  5866 .",
    "this galaxy locates in a low density environment , with two companions , ngc  5907 and ngc  5879 , located several hundred kpc away in projection ; their interactions with ngc  5866 should have negligible effects on the coronal properties .",
    "the agn and star formation activities are both weak , unlikely contributing significantly to the x - ray emission .",
    "the edge - on orientation helps the gas - rich galactic disk to block most of the on - disk x - ray - bright point - like sources , reducing the complexity of analyzing the low - resolution _ suzaku _ data . based on our preliminary study of ngc  5866 using _",
    "chandra _ and multi - wavelength data @xcite , we found it has high fe / o abundance ratio as a disk galaxy @xcite , thus well - suited for studying type  ia sn metal enrichment .",

    "we identify the high background flare time intervals using a @xmath8 clip with a lightcurve binned at 200  s. we then remove these background flares and obtain an effective exposure time of 100.8 , 80.9 , 100.2  ks for xis0 , xis1 , xis3 , respectively .",

    "unlike x - ray faint stellar sources , the contribution from these x - ray bright sources is quite uncertain , and could be the major uncertainty in characterizing the truly hot gas emission .",

    ", we also need to quantify the various stellar contributions . with the archival _ chandra _ data",
    ", we reach a point source detection limit of @xmath16 in 0.5 - 8  kev .",
    "the accumulated spectrum of all the detected point sources within the inner halo region can be well modeled with a power law , which has a photon index of @xmath17 and an absorbing column density slightly larger than the galactic foreground value of @xmath18 . below the detection limit",
    ", the unresolved stellar source emission is dominated by the emission from cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and coronal active binaries ( abs ) , as well as the emission from unresolved low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) and the residual photons spilling out of the discrete source removal circles .",
    "similar as @xcite , we model this component with a 0.5  kev mekal model ( optically thin thermal plasma ) and a @xmath19 power law model .",

    "the temperature of the hot gas in the inner halo seems too low to be primarily heated by sne . in gas - poor galactic bulges like ngc  5866",
    ", hot gas is the dominant phase and the radiative cooling of the shocked ism is overall not important in the sn energy budget ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the specific enthalpy of old stellar feedback ( mass loss of evolved low - mass stars and type  ia sne heating ) is @xmath25 per particle .",
    "such a specific enthalpy gives an average gas temperature of @xmath26 , considering the energy equipartition between the hot gas thermal energy and the energy stored in magnetic field and cosmic rays as well as turbulent motion @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "adopting a central velocity dispersion of @xmath27 obtained from the hyperleda database , the expected temperature of gas thermalized in the gravitational potential of ngc  5866 would be @xmath28 , quite close to the measured hot gas temperature of @xmath1 in the inner halo ( table  [ table : specfitresult ] ) .",
    "therefore , the low measured hot gas temperature _ apparently _ indicates that any additional sources of non - gravitational heating , such as type  ia sne , play a relatively minor role ( contributes only @xmath29 of the total thermal energy ) .",
    "although located in a very low density environment ( the environmental galaxy number density of ngc  5866 is @xmath30 ; in comparison , @xmath31 is classified as clustered in @xcite ) , it is still possible that there exists a low - density intra - group medium around ngc  5866 .",
    "however , neither of the existing _ suzaku _ or _ chandra _ data as presented in this paper is deep enough to probe the hot gas distribution at large radii .",
    "chandra _ x - ray intensity profiles at small radii , approximately within the spectral analysis regions of the present paper , are presented in @xcite .",
    "these profiles do not reveal any diffuse soft x - ray emission above the stellar contributions at @xmath32 ( or roughly the inner halo region in this paper ; fig .",
    "[ fig : image]b ) . therefore , based on the existing x - ray data , we do not find significant evidence for the existence of an intra - group medium , which , if presents , could help to raise the hot gas temperature in the outer halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is suggested that the x - ray emissivity of early - type galactic coronae , and also the fraction of sn ejecta detected in soft x - ray , are highly affected by the specific energy of the hot gas ( energy per unit mass , or temperature if the gas is thermalized ; @xcite ) .",
    "if this specific energy is reduced by some processes , there will be a lower temperature of the hot gas and slower galactic outflow . as a result",
    ", the hot gas density and x - ray emissivity will be raised and there will be a larger amount of heavy elements produced by type  ia sne ( such as fe ) detected in soft x - ray .",
    "cool - hot gas interaction , as indicated by the relatively large amount of cool gas ( table  [ table : earlytypecoabun ] ; fig .",
    "[ fig : feoratiomh2 ] ) and the presence of extraplanar dusty filaments in ngc  5866 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : hstfilaments ] ) , could provide a natural explanation of both the low temperature and high fe abundance of the hot gas .",
    "the apparently low type  ia sne contribution to the heating of the hot gas is very unlikely , because ngc  5866 shows so many features related to type  ia sne feedback , such as the fe enrichment detected in hot gas and the consistency of the gravitational energy of many extraplanar dusty filaments with a single sn energy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the significant raising of the hot gas temperature in the outer halo ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ktcompare ] ;  [ subsec : specanalysis ] ) in such a low - mass isolated galaxy is quite uncommon ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although we can not absolutely exclude the contribution from a low - density intra - group medium based on the existing _ suzaku _ or _ chandra _ data , it is natural that there exists some additional cooling processes , such as the cool - hot gas interaction .",
    "the presence of cool gas could affect the surrounding hot gas properties via mass loading and enhanced radiative cooling , both processes reduce the specific energy and so the temperature of the hot gas .    the unusually strong cool - hot gas interaction in ngc  5866 as an s0 galaxy could also help to explain the high fe abundance detected in soft x - ray .",
    "the cool gas is often less metal - enriched , and the mass loading of cool gas into hot phase will result in a lower average metallicity of the hot gas .",
    "however , most of the sn ejecta contained in the high - temperature ( typically @xmath33 ) hot gas has too low emissivity to be detected in soft x - ray , because the hot gas density of gas - poor galactic bulge is too low ( typically @xmath34 , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the cool - hot gas interaction will have an opposite effect on the observed gas metallicity , by significantly increasing the soft x - ray emissivity and so the _ emission - measure - weighted _ metallcity as obtained from x - ray observations .",
    "such a difference between the emission - measure- and mass - weighted metallicity is also evidenced by numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , indicating that we are missing from the detection in x - ray observations of a large fraction of gas - phase metals , as also being estimated in ",
    "[ subsec : hotgasmetallicity ] .",
    "we present detail calibration of the _ suzaku _ observation of an isolated s0 galaxy ngc  5866 . by jointly analyzing this _ suzaku _ data together with an archival _ chandra _ observation",
    ", we obtain the hot gas temperature in the inner ( @xmath35 ) and outer ( @xmath36 ) halos , as well as the o and fe abundances in the inner halo .",
    "these measurements of the hot gas properties are much more accurate than previous measurements with the _ chandra _ data only , allowing for a comparison with other galaxies .",
    "we find a significant supersolar fe / o abundance ratio of @xmath37 at @xmath38 statistical confidence level in the inner halo of ngc  5866 , indicating a clear metal enrichment from type  ia sne .",
    "the fe / o abundance ratio of ngc  5866 is also significantly higher than other disk ( spiral+s0 ) galaxies , and even many of the elliptical galaxies .",
    "we also find that ngc  5866 simultaneously has the highest fe / o abundance ratio and molecular gas mass ( @xmath21 ) among a small sample of gas - poor early - type galaxies , although the poor and mostly upper limit measurement of @xmath21 prevents us from claiming a clear positive correlation between fe / o and @xmath21 .",
    "the total amount of fe detected in the inner halo of ngc  5866 is @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast , the total amount of fe injected by type  ia sne within the dynamical cross timescale of the galactic outflow is @xmath40 , while that within the age of the galaxy since the last starburst is @xmath41 . considering the uncertainty of the volume filling factor @xmath42 which can not be too low in this non - starburst s0 galaxy , we could conclude that ngc  5866 could preserve a larger than usual fraction , but far from the total amount of fe injected by type  ia sne .",
    "ngc  5866 exhibits a lot of extraplanar dusty filaments extending perpendicular to the galactic disk within the inner halo .",
    "these filaments indicate the existence of interaction between sne and cool gas , which probably triggers cool gas mass loading into the hot phase and enhances the radiative cooling .",
    "we find clearly lower hot gas temperature in the inner halo than in the outer halo , which is apparently a result of this cool - hot gas interaction , if this well isolated galaxy is not highly affected by a high - temperature intra - group medium .",
    "this low temperature in the inner halo is also roughly consistent with gravitational heating of the material lost by evolved stars , _ apparently _ leaving little room for additional non - gravitational heating such as by type  ia sne .",
    "however , heating by type  ia sne is very likely to be important in this galaxy showing clear fe enrichment and cool - hot gas interaction",
    ". therefore , additional cooling processes must exist .",
    "the low temperature and high fe abundance of the hot gas in the inner halo of ngc  5866 strongly suggest that the presence of cool gas in gas - poor galaxy bulges could trigger cool - hot gas interaction , resulting in a lower hot gas temperature and a larger fraction of sn ejecta detected in soft x - ray around the galaxy .",
    "however , most of the metal - enriched sne ejecta is still missing from a clear detection in x - ray .",
