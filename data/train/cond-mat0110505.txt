    "over 50 years the effective mass or envelope function method is widely used to describe physical properties of various spatially inhomogeneous semiconductor systems .",
    "originally the envelope function approach was developed for external potentials which vary slowly on the atomic scale @xcite .",
    "nonetheless the application of this method to semiconductor nanostructures with microscopically abrupt heterointerfaces is commonly accepted and frequently gives unexpectedly good results.@xcite    the central question to the effective mass method in the context of heterostructure applications is how to connect envelopes at a heterointerface .",
    "the simplest and historically the first connection rules follow from the assumption that the effective schrdinger equation for the envelope function @xmath0 @xmath1 is valid everywhere in space , and any abrupt variation of material parameters can be viewed as a limit of smooth function .",
    "this assumption allows to obtain boundary conditions by the integration eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) over an infinitesimally small distance across the interface @xcite . as a result",
    "we get the connection rules @xcite @xmath2 ( @xmath3 is the component of momentum perpendicular to the interface ) which are commonly called the standard or bendaniel - duke boundary conditions . for the one - band effective mass model the boundary conditions eq .",
    "( [ sbc ] ) are reduced to the continuity of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the effective mass .",
    "obviously , the standard connection rules can not be universal since they contain only bulk parameters of materials which constitute the heterojunction and thus completely neglect internal properties of the interface .",
    "in fact , they work quite well for gaas / algaas heteropair , but fail to describe properly more complicated situations . @xcite the failure of the standard boundary conditions was also explicitly demonstrated for a number of particular microscopic models of heterostructures .",
    "@xcite    a natural phenomenological way to take into account the above mentioned results is to relax the assumption of applicability of eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) near an interface and to allow for the discontinuity of both envelops and their first derivatives .",
    "due to the superposition principle , wave functions at opposite sides of the interface must be connected by a linear relation . assuming locality of this relation we arrive at the following connection rules @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the transfer matrix .",
    "boundary conditions of the form eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) were introduced by ando and mori for the one - band effective mass model.@xcite later they were also adopted to different milti - band models which describe @xmath9 and @xmath10 conduction bands,@xcite degenerate heavy hole and light hole valence bands,@xcite and conduction and valence bands within the spherical kane approximation.@xcite    the transfer matrix approach unifies all possible boundary conditions which have been suggested in the literature ( for particular examples see refs .  ) .",
    "in fact , the standard boundary conditions eq .",
    "( [ sbc ] ) are described by the diagonal transfer matrix : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; @xmath14-matrix with @xmath11 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 corresponds to the introduction of a @xmath17-function interface potential;@xcite if only off - diagonal elements contribute to the transfer matrix we obtain `` inverted '' boundary conditions @xcite ( see also ref .  ) which hold with a high accuracy for gasb / inas interface ; @xcite etc .",
    "in general all components of the transfer matrix @xmath14 can be nonzero .",
    "they reflect internal structure of the heterointerface and can not be expressed in terms of only bulk parameters . for different particular cases components of @xmath14-matrix",
    "were calculated using empirical tight - binding and/or pseudopotential approaches.@xcite    the general connection rules eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) can be rigorously justified within the generalized effective mass theory .",
    "@xcite this approach leads to a set of integral - differential equations for envelope functions which are defined using a single bloch basis for the whole structure .",
    "coefficients in these equations and , therefore , envelopes are smooth and continuous functions even for a system with microscopically abrupt interfaces . near an interface",
    "the coefficients depend on microscopic details of the interface .",
    "normally a perturbation , which is caused by the interface , is localized at the atomic scale .",
    "hence , if we are interested in behavior of envelop functions on the scale which is larger than the lattice constant , we can use extrapolated bulk envelopes instead of the exact envelop functions . despite the exact envelopes are smooth and continuous , the extrapolated functions obey general connection rules eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) with parameters which depend on details of the interface.@xcite the regular calculation of the transfer matrix using the generalized effective - mass theory @xcite is an extremely tedious task .",
    "however this theory can be considered as a foundation for the phenomenological introduction of the transfer matrix .    in this paper",
    "we follow such a phenomenological approach and develop a general method for construction of the transfer matrix ( sec .",
    "namely , we assume that the differential equation ( or system of equations ) eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) with piecewise smooth coefficients is not applicable at interface points ( which are the points of discontinuity of the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) is defined on a space of piecewise smooth and continuous functions with linear connection rules at the points of discontinuity .",
    "we show that hermiticity of the hamiltonian on this space of functions impose the first set of restrictions on the form of connection rules .",
    "a particular consequence of these restrictions is the conservation of the flow at the interface .",
    "similar methodology , which can be found in quantum mechanics text books,@xcite has been recently applied to the one - band effective mass model with a general form of the kinetic energy operator.@xcite the second set of restrictions follows from the symmetry - the transfer matrix must be invariant with respect to transformations of the interface symmetry group .",
    "these two sets of restrictions strongly reduce the number of components in the transfer matrix .",
    "the rest of @xmath14-matrix along with band offsets should be considered as empirical parameters which are defined from experiment ( see for example ref .  ) and/or _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the method developed in sec .",
    "ii is closely related to the common method of invariants@xcite which allows to construct effective @xmath19 hamiltonians for bulk semiconductors using only hermiticity and symmetry requirements .",
    "the general connection rules eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) allow to describe various physical consequences of nontrivial internal details of a heterointerface .",
    "it has been demonstrated in ref .   that the use of general boundary conditions removes quantitative discrepancies between square well calculations and experiment.@xcite there are also more transparent qualitative effects which come from the complex structure of boundary conditions .",
    "for example , in multi - band models the off - diagonal element @xmath20 ( which is equivalent to an interface @xmath17-potential ) is responsible for the interface heavy - light hole@xcite and @xmath21 electron @xcite mixing . in the present paper we concentrate on a description of interface localized and resonant states .    in 1932",
    "tamm@xcite demonstrated the existence of electronic states localized at a surface of a semiconductor .",
    "it is quite natural to expect that similar localized states with energies inside the forbidden gap can occur at an abrupt heterojunction .",
    "such a possibility was qualitatively considered by james @xcite and later by zhu and kroemer.@xcite in ref .   the existence of interface donor states was postulated to explain anomalous transport properties of undoped inas / alsb quantum - well structures .",
    "however , general conditions for occurrence of interface states remained unclear for a long time .",
    "this problem was addressed in ref .   and recently in ref .   using the tight - binding approach .",
    "since the effective - mass method is of extreme importance for heterostructure applications , it is desirable to have a description of interface states in terms of envelope functions .",
    "it is known that envelope - function models with the standard boundary conditions possess interface states.@xcite however the corresponding energy levels always lie in the region of band offsets outside the energy gap of a heterojunction.@xcite an interesting exception is the formation of localized states at heterojunctions with band inversion.@xcite these states have a topological nature and are related to the supersymmetry of an inverse contact.@xcite    in sec .",
    "iii of our paper we show that different types of interface states which have energies in the forbidden gap can be described using generalized connection rules .",
    "we apply the boundary conditions derived in sec .",
    "ii to the one - band effective - mass model and to the 4-band kane model which describe @xmath9-point states in iii - v semiconductors .",
    "we derive general conditions for the existence of interface states , and discuss the physical meaning of the off - diagonal components in the transfer matrix . in sec .",

    "v we summarize our results .",

    "we showed that the hermiticity of the hamiltonian and the symmetry of the interface plane impose the restrictions on the form of transfer matrix .",
    "these restrictions can be formulated as a set of equations for components of the transfer matrix .",
    "solution of these equations defines the general form of the boundary conditions for a given interface . to illustrate this approach we considered the one - band and 4-band envelope function models and established the conditions for the existence of tamm - like localized interface states .",
    "we have also demonstrated that in a system with more than one heterointerface there exists a possibility for new physical effects such as the resonant tunneling through a single potential barrier .    in this paper",
    "we did not discuss the application of our general results to particular heterostructures .",
