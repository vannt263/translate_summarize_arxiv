    "double affine hecke algebras were introduced by cherednik @xcite , @xcite in connection with affine quantum knizhnik - zamolodchikov equations and eigenvalue problems of macdonald type . as a general principle one can associate to any type of root system ( finite , affine , elliptic ) a weyl group , an artin group and a hecke algebra . along these lines ,",
    "double affine hecke algebras are associated with a certain class of elliptic root systems .",
    "the section [ preliminaries ] contains the definitions and relevant results about double affine weyl groups , their artin groups and their hecke algebras as well as a topological interpretation of affine artin groups due to h. van der lek .",
    "one of the key features of double affine hecke algebras is that they contain two commutative subalgebras .",
    "our main result roughly states that there exists a pairing between the root systems in question such that their corresponding weyl groups , artin groups and hecke algebras are canonically isomorphic in such a way that for the hecke algebras the roles of the above mentioned commutative subalgebras is interchanged .",
    "the section [ involution ] contains the precise statements of these results . as a consequence of the existence of such canonical isomorphisms",
    "there exists the possibility of defining some special elements of the double affine hecke algebras , called intertwiners .",
    "the importance of the intertwiners was first understood by knop and sahi @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for @xmath0 and then by cherednik @xcite in the general ( reduced ) case .",
    "their properties , as they follow from the isomorphism allows them to play a central role in the theory of ( non)symmetric macdonald polynomials ( see @xcite for a full account on intertwiners ) .",

    "this relates the double affine artin groups and the fundamental groups of certain complex hyperplane complements .",
    "section [ topological ] reveals this connection and establishes the canonical isomorphism at the level of artin groups .",
    "section [ hecke ] finishes the proof of the existence of the canonical isomorphism at the level of hecke algebras .",
    "the statements of our main result as well as the connection between the double affine artin groups and certain fundamental groups were announced in theorem 2.2 and theorem 2.4 of @xcite .",
