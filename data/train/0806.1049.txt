    "the lhc is set to explore the physics of the weak scale , whatever it should turn out to be .",
    "supersymmetry is one of the leading candidates and enormous effort has been dedicated to studying missing energy signals that characterize almost any weak - scale supersymmetric model .",
    "however , supersymmetry searches will be challenging and disentangling the supersymmetry parameters will be more difficult still .    in light of the above",
    ", it is imperative to study every possible channel in order to optimize our chances of discovering new physics and understanding the underlying theory . in this regard , events with the lowest multiplicity may be the simplest ones with which to make headway on the inverse problem .",
    "although two - jet events with missing energy have been studied at the tevatron @xcite , they have been less prominent in lhc studies .",
    "atlas has shown that two jet events can be useful for certain susy models , both for discovery and for constraining superpartner masses @xcite , but recent atlas and cms studies have focused more heavily on the more challenging cascade decays . in this paper",
    "we study one novel and two existing kinematic variables that can be used to capture dijet missing - energy events without explicit reference to missing transverse energy .",
    "we find that pairs of these variables can be used to give signal - to - background of at least 45 , indicating that these variables are worth exploring with a full detector simulation .",
    "dijet events are worthy of attention as a potentially clear window into parameter space . they are not results of complicated cascade decays but arise simply from two squarks decaying to two quarks and two neutralinos . because we know the identity of the particles involved and because there are so few , the signal is relatively straightforward to interpret .",
    "for example , with sufficient integrated luminosity , these events alone can be used to constrain the squark and neutralino masses .",
    "dijet studies along the lines explored here may usefully supplement recent analyses dedicated to distinguishing susy from other models using events with at least three jets @xcite .",
    "the kinematic variables we consider are constructed from the two jets momenta alone .",
    "these variables should have different systematic uncertainties than missing transverse energy since they pick out slightly different events and are based on different measurements . at the very least , then , the searches we suggest should be worthwhile as cross - checks of standard searches .",
    "the variables we use may also be useful for optimization when signal - to - background is relatively low .",
    "the searches we describe will be most effective when squarks are pair - produced in abundance and have large branching ratios to decay directly to the lightest neutralino , which requires that squarks are lighter than the gluino so that cascade decays through gluinos are absent . because @xmath1-channel gluino exchange is an important source of squark pair production , the lighter the gluino the more prominent the signal .",
    "for the parameter points considered below , we find the signal is cut by a factor of @xmath2 when the gluino decouples .",
    "fortunately , comparable gluino and squark masses are a feature of a large class of models  most notably high - scale models where the heavier gluino mass feeds into the squark mass .",
    "we focus on such models in this study .",
    "before getting to the dijet properties that will be the focus of our study , we consider the effectiveness of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the missing transverse energy obtained from the dijet system alone .",
    "after requiring the sum of the two jets @xmath5 s to be greater than 500 gev , event rates and signal - to - background ratios for one particular susy point are presented in table [ table : met ] ( details regarding event generation and cuts are given below ) .",
    "neither variable suffices for a clean search , but we observe that the @xmath6 values obtained using @xmath4 are essentially identical to those obtained using @xmath7 .",
    "this analysis suggests that , in the two - jet channel at high @xmath5 , nothing is to be gained by using full @xmath7 rather than kinematic variables associated with the two jets alone .",
    ".for dijet events passing the cuts described in the text , the dependence of the signal cross section and signal - to - background ( @xmath6 ) on a variable @xmath7 cut ( top ) , and on a variable @xmath4 cut ( bottom ) .",
    "all energies are in gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ default ]",
    "we have studied several kinematic variables that can be used for dijet susy searches , and found that they give reasonable signal - to - background ratios .",
    "dijet events can be used to constrain susy mass parameters should the type of supersymmetry model we have considered be correct .",
    "studies of @xmath8jet events with leptonic @xmath9 decays will give a better understanding of the background and a more reliable extraction of signal from background .",
    "for the future , it would be useful to see how well the lessons here can be applied to develop multijet searches that do not rely on full missing energy .",
