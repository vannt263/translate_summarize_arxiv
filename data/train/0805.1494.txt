    "in this paper , we examine the nature of the higgs transition in a two - component theory with a dynamical gauge field in three ( classical ) dimensions ( 3d).@xcite a schematic continuum action is @xmath1 @xmath2 has two complex components and @xmath3 is the gauge field that can take any real values ( i.e. , it is non - compact ) .",
    "this theory is also called the noncompact cp@xmath0 model ( nccp@xmath0).@xcite when the charged field @xmath2 is gapped , the gauge field is massless and there is a free photon , but when @xmath2 condenses , @xmath3 becomes massive  this is the higgs transition . in ref .",
    ", we argued that this action also describes an o(3 ) classical spin system with prohibited hedgehog topological defects on long scales .",
    "in particular , the ordering transition in the hedgehog - suppressed model and the above higgs transition are in the same universality .",
    "the nature of the transition is of interest in the context of the recently discussed quantum phase transitions that lie outside the landau - ginzburg - wilson framework .",
    "@xcite thus , it has been proposed@xcite that the neel to valence bond solid transition in a spin-1/2 system with su(2 ) symmetry can undergo a continuous quantum phase transition described by the same universality eq .",
    "( [ s_continuum ] ) .    here",
    "we present a detailed numerical analysis of several lattice realizations of the theory  ( [ s_continuum ] ) ( we will refer to these as lattice superconductor models@xcite ) .",
    "we extend the study of ref .   of the su(2)-symmetric two - component model , with the goal to check more thoroughly the proposed second - order nature of the transition . here",
    ", we argue that our models have continuous higgs transition over wide parameter ranges , see figs .",
    "[ fig : phased]b , c .",
    "note that in one of our models , fig .",
    "[ fig : phased]b , we also find a parameter range , in the vicinity of a third `` molecular '' phase [ produced when gauge neutral pairs of the @xmath4 particles of eq .",
    "( [ s_continuum ] ) condense ] , where the transition becomes first order .",
    "this is always a possibility , and in the specific model happens generically near this new phase .",
    "we adopt two fresh strategies to establish the nature of the transition in these systems .",
    "first , in the regime where we believe the transition is second - order , we compare with a one - component model for which it is well established that the transition is continuous,@xcite and show that the transition in our two - component models is `` more continuous '' , in the sense that the thermodynamic singularities are more weak .",
    "second , we introduce a lattice realization of the model in eq .",
    "( [ s_continuum ] ) , where the molecular phase is entirely absent . the higgs transition is then shown to be continuous over the entire phase boundary , which greatly simplifies the interpretation .",
    "our best estimates for the exponents at this transition are @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "recent quantum monte carlo simulations of square lattice @xmath7 heisenberg antiferromagnets with four spin exchange terms and su(2 ) symmetry have also found a continuous relativistic transition between a neel and valence bond solid phase,@xcite which is believed to be in the same universality class as the transition studied here .",
    "the exponents obtained in those studies are @xmath8 and @xmath9 in ref .   and @xmath10 in ref .  ,",
    "consistent with the ones reported here .",
    "other studies,@xcite particularly in two - component superconductor models where the su(2 ) symmetry is broken down to u(1 ) ( easy plane nccp@xmath0 ) , have suggested that such higgs transitions may always be first order . while those authors so far have found first order transitions in these u(1)@xmath11u(1 ) models , we do not know any fundamental reasons why this needs to hold generally .",
    "this is particularly true in light of the evidence presented here for a continuous transition in the su(2 ) symmetric model .",
    "moreover , the studies in refs .   were performed on models where the molecular phase is present , which we suspect may be driving the first order nature of the transition . in future work",
    "we will apply the ideas described here to obtain and study models without a molecular phase in this symmetry class as well , which should help clarify the issue .",
    "the study of the criticality in the theory  ( [ s_continuum ] ) dates back to halperin , lubensky , and ma.@xcite at the fixed point where the matter and gauge fields are decoupled ( @xmath12 ) , the gauge interaction is a relevant perturbation , and no new stable fixed points were found in @xmath13 treatment when the number of components @xmath14 is less than 365 .",
    "this was interpreted as an evidence for a fluctuation - induced first - order transition . for larger",
    "@xmath14 , and also in a @xmath15 treatment directly in @xmath16 , the transition was found to be continuous .",
    "later work by dasgupta and halperin@xcite showed that the transition in the @xmath17 case can also be continuous .",
    "the one - component superconductor model is dual to the usual 3d xy model that has only short - range interactions .",
    "concisely stated , one can fruitfully think about the one - component system in terms of the abrikosov - nielsen - olesen ( ano ) vortices which carry quantized gauge flux and have only short - range interactions .",
    "the duality claim then follows if we recall that the 3d xy model can be also viewed as a system of short - range interacting current loops .",
    "the higgs phase where the ano vortices are gapped corresponds to the disordered phase of the xy model with small loops , while the disordered phase of the charged superconductor where the ano vortices condense corresponds to the ordered phase of the xy model with proliferated loops .",
    "thus , the ano vortices play a crucial role , which is difficult to capture in the @xmath18 treatment .",
    "we expect that the same physics happens in the two - component case , but with the ano vortices that now have non - trivial internal structure . while our analytical picture is not as complete as in the one - component case , since we are unable to perform a duality transformation in the present case , one of our models has a limit that strongly suggests such an interpretation , and we confirm that the transition is continuous by direct monte carlo studies on the lattice .",
    "one of our main strategy exploring such new two - component matter - gauge systems in monte carlo is to compare closely with the well - understood one - component case .",
    "we simulate both systems under similar conditions and compare directly observables in the gauge sector that detect the meissner - anderson - higgs physics of charged condensates .",
    "we also study separately new features in the two - component system , such as the presence and possible condensation of composite gauge - neutral fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] , we define the models and describe their overall phase diagrams . in sec .",
    "[ sec : transitions ] , we focus on the higgs transitions and present several two - component cases where we argue the transition is continuous .",
    "we also discuss the observed systematics along the full photon to higgs phase boundary and show that we can improve it by suppressing possible other phases . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we summarize the results and conclude with an outlook .",
    "we study the following three models .",
    "the first model realizes a one - component lattice superconductor : @xmath19 a u(1 ) matter field @xmath20 resides on the sites of a 3d cubic lattice , while a non - compact gauge field @xmath21 resides on the links ; @xmath22 is the usual lattice maxwell action for the gauge field .",
    "we will use ` nccp@xmath23 ' as a short - hand reference to this model , where ` cp@xmath23 ' refers to one matter field component while ` nc ' emphasizes that the gauge field is non - compact.@xcite this model and the ones below have two parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the nccp@xmath23 model is our reference system for matter - gauge simulations .",
    "the second model realizes a two - component lattice superconductor : @xmath26 here the matter field is a cp@xmath0 field @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "this model was introduced in ref .   and studied at @xmath29 using small system sizes ; the present work is an extension of that study .",
    "the third model is a different realization of the two - component case : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the modified bessel function . compared to the model i , there is an additional antiferromagnetic interaction between nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "this interaction eliminates the unwanted molecular phase from our phase diagram . our motivation for this model will become clear soon , while here we only note that the specific form allows some analytical understanding of the phase diagram and that any such short - range interaction that respects the symmetries of the problem does not change the universality of the transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : phased ] shows the phase diagrams of the three models in the @xmath32 parameter space . in each case , for small @xmath24 , the matter fields are gapped and the gauge field is massless described by the maxwell term  we mark this as the photon phase . on the other hand , when @xmath24 and @xmath25 are sufficiently large , the matter fields condense and gap out the photon  this is the higgs phase . in the one - component case , there remain no gapless excitations . in the two - component system , we can construct a gauge - invariant o(3 ) vector field @xmath33 this obtains an expectation value in the higgs phase , and there appear goldstone modes associated with the global symmetry breaking .",
    "the focus in this paper is on the photon to higgs transition driven by the condensation of the charged matter fields .",
    "we will also see how to view this transition coming from the higgs side as driven by proliferation of the ano vortices with internal structure .    proceeding with more details on the phase diagrams , consider first the nccp@xmath23 model . at @xmath34 , there is no gauge field left and the transition along this axis is 3d xy ordering of the @xmath20 field ( in fig .  [",
    "fig : phased]a , this transition point is indicated with a star symbol ) .",
    "when @xmath25 becomes finite and the matter - gauge coupling is switched on , the universality of the transition changes .",
    "dasgupta and halperin@xcite argued that sufficiently far from the @xmath35 limit , the transition becomes inverted xy as summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] in terms of the ano vortices .",

    "but several scenarios were discussed .",

    "the picture of the transition becomes particularly simple in the limit @xmath36 . here",

    "there are only small loops for @xmath40 , but they proliferate for @xmath41 . the transition is 3d xy in terms of these short - range interacting loops , which are precisely the ano vortices carrying quantized flux .",
    "these loops are gapped on the higgs side and condense upon reducing @xmath25 and @xmath24 , which is why the transition is referred to as ` inverted xy ' ( as opposed to ` direct xy ' transition at @xmath34 where currents conjugate to @xmath20 proliferate upon increasing @xmath24 ) .",
    "the universality of the transition remains unchanged also away from the @xmath36 limit .",
    "indeed , one can see that finite @xmath24 only leads to short - range modifications of the ano vortex interactions and therefore does not change the nature of the transition . to conclude the description of the nccp@xmath23 phase diagram , we readily see that there are no transitions along the @xmath42 or @xmath43 axes in fig .",
    "[ fig : phased]a .",
    "consider now the nccp@xmath0 model i , whose phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phased]b . similarly to the nccp@xmath23 case",
    ", there is no transition along the @xmath43 axis . along the @xmath35 line ,",
    "the gauge field is again absent and the transition is in the o(4 ) universality class , but the universality changes once @xmath25 becomes finite .",

    "[ sec : transitions ] ) .",
    "unlike the one - component case , this two - component model has an additional phase at small @xmath25 and large @xmath24 , which , while interesting on its own , does not bear on the universality class of the higgs transition that we are interested in . for completeness and in order to better understand the numerics in this model , let us describe the new phase , which we mark as molecular . here ,",
    "the charged field @xmath44 is gapped but the charge - neutral field @xmath45 obtains an expectation value , and the o(3 ) order and the photon coexist .",
    "this molecular condensate appears because of the attraction between oppositely charged @xmath46 and @xmath44 fields .",
    "explicitly , consider the @xmath42 axis .",
    "the gauge field can be integrated out completely , with the resulting action for the @xmath44 s @xmath47 = - \\sum_{i,\\mu } \\ln i_0({{\\cal j}}|{\\bm z}_i^\\dagger { \\bm z}_{i+\\mu}| ) ~. \\label{nccp1_k0}\\ ] ] since @xmath48 there is thus a ferromagnetic interaction between neighboring spins that drives an o(3 ) ordering transition upon increasing @xmath24 along the @xmath42 axis .",
    "the transition remains in the same universality also for small @xmath25 .",

    "we do not have such a complete control to be able to reliably extract the critical indices , but we will show representative points on the phase boundary where numerics is strongly in favor of the second - order character which is `` more continuous '' than in the nccp@xmath23 case .",
