    "in this contribution we consider linear elliptic problems with a heterogenous and highly variable diffusion coefficient @xmath0 as arisen often in hydrology or in material sciences . in the following",
    ", we are looking for @xmath1 which solves @xmath2 in a weak sense . here",
    ", we denote    * @xmath3 , @xmath4 , a bounded lipschitz domain with a piecewise polygonal boundary , * @xmath5 a source term , and * @xmath6 a symmetric matrix - valued function with uniform spectral bounds @xmath7 , @xmath8\\quad\\text{for almost all } x\\in \\omega.\\ ] ] we call the ratio @xmath9 the _ contrast _ of @xmath0 .",
    "under assumptions ( a1)-(a3 ) and by the lax - milgram theorem , there exists a unique weak solution @xmath10 to @xmath11 where @xmath12    the problematic term in the equation is the diffusion matrix @xmath0 , which is known to exhibit very fast variations on a very fine scale ( i.e. it has a multiscale character ) .",
    "these variations can be highly heterogenous and unstructured , which is why it is often necessary to resolve them globally by an underlying computational grid that matches the said heterogeneity . using standard finite element methods , this results in high dimensional solution spaces and hence an enormous computational demand , which often can not be handled even by today s computing technology .",
    "consequently , there is a need for alternative methods , so called multiscale methods , which can either operate below linear computational complexity by using local representative elements ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) or which can split the original problem into very localized subproblems that cover @xmath13 but that can be solved cheaply and independent from each other ( cf . @xcite ) .    in this paper , we focus on a rather recent approach called localized orthogonal decomposition ( lod ) that was introduced by mlqvist and peterseim @xcite and",
    "further generalized in @xcite .",
    "we consider a coarse space @xmath14 , which is low - dimensional but possibly inadequate for finding a reliable galerkin approximation to the multiscale solution of problem ( [ exact - solution ] ) .",
    "the idea of the method is to start from this coarse space and to update the corresponding set of basis functions step - by - step to improve the approximation properties of the space . in a summarized form , this can be described in four steps : 1 ) define a ( quasi ) interpolation operator @xmath15 from @xmath16 onto @xmath14 , 2 ) information in the kernel of the interpolation operator is considered to be negligible ( having a small @xmath17-norm ) , 3 ) hence define the space of negligible information by the kernel of this interpolation , i.e. @xmath18kern@xmath19 , and 4 ) find the orthogonal complement of @xmath20 with respect to a scalar product @xmath21 , where @xmath21 describes a discretization of the problem to solve . in many cases ,",
    "it can be shown , that this ( low dimensional ) orthogonal complement space has very accurate approximation properties with respect to the exact solution .",
    "typically , the computation of the orthogonal decomposition is localized to small patches in order to reduce the computational complexity .",
    "so far , the concept of the lod has been successfully applied to nonlinear elliptic problems @xcite , eigenvalue problems @xcite and the nonlinear schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was combined with a discontinuous galerkin method @xcite and extended to the setting of partition of unity methods @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we are concerned with analyzing the lod framework in petrov - galerkin formulation , i.e. for the case that the discrete trial and test spaces are not identical .",
    "we show that an lod method in petrov - galerkin formulations still preserves the convergence rates of the original formulation of the method . at the same time , the new method can exhibit significant advantages , such as decreased computational complexity and mass conservation properties . in this paper , we discuss these advantages in detail ; we give examples for realizations and present numerical experiments .",
    "in particular , we apply the proposed framework to design a locally conservative multiscale solver for the simulation of two - phase flow models as governed by the buckley - leverett equation .",
    "we remark that employing petrov - galerkin variational frameworks in the construction and analysis of multiscale methods for solving elliptic problems in heterogeneous media has been investigated in the past , see for example @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] lays out the setting and notation for the formulation of the multiscale methods that includes the description of two - grid discretization and the localized orthogonal decomposition ( lod ) . in section  [ sec : methods ] , we present the multiscale methods based on the lod framework , starting from the usual galerkin variational equation and concentrating further on the petrov - galerkin variational equation that is the main contribution of the paper .",
    "we establish in this section that the petrov - galerkin lod ( pg - lod ) exhibits the same convergence behavior as the usual galerkin lod ( g - lod ) .",
    "furthermore , we draw a contrast in the aspect of practical implementation that makes up a strong advantage of pg - lod in relative comparison to g - lod . the other advantage of the pg - lod which can not be achieved with g - lod is the ability to produce a locally conservative flux field at the elemental level when discontinuous finite element is utilized .",
    "we also discuss in this section an application of the pg - lod for solving the pressure equation in the simulation of two - phase flow models to demonstrate this particular advantage .",
    "section  [ section : numerical : experiments ] gives two sets of numerical experiment : one that confirms the theoretical finding and the other demonstrating the application of pg - lod in the two - phase flow simulation .",
    "we present the proofs of the theoretical findings in section  [ section : proofs : pg : lod ] .",
    "in this section we introduce notations that are required for the formulation of the multiscale methods .      we define two different meshes on @xmath13 .",
    "the first mesh is a coarse mesh and is denoted by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denote the maximum diameter of all elements of @xmath22 .",
    "the second mesh is a fine mesh denoted by @xmath24 with @xmath25 representing the maximum diameter of all elements of @xmath24 . by fine",
    "we mean that any variation of the coefficient @xmath0 is resolved within this grid , leading to a high dimensional discrete space that is associated with this mesh .",
    "the mesh @xmath24 is assumed to be a ( possibly non - uniform ) refinement of @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , both grids are shape - regular and conforming partitions of @xmath13 and we assume that @xmath26 .",
    "for the subsequent methods to make sense , we also assume that each element of @xmath22 is at least twice uniformly refined to create @xmath24 .",
    "the set of all lagrange points ( vertices ) of @xmath27 is denoted by @xmath28 , and the set of interior lagrange points is denoted by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is either @xmath31 or @xmath25 .",
    "now we consider an abstract discretization of the exact problem ( [ exact - solution ] ) .",
    "for this purpose , we let @xmath32 denote a high dimensional discrete space in which we seek an approximation @xmath33 of @xmath1 .",
    "a simple example would be the classical @xmath34 lagrange finite element space associated with @xmath24 .",
    "however , note that we do not assume that @xmath32 is a subspace of @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , later we give an example for which @xmath32 consists of non - continuous piecewise linear functions . next , we assume that we are interested in solving a fine scale problem , that can be characterized by a scalar product @xmath21 on @xmath32 . accordingly , a method on the coarse scale can be described by some @xmath35 , which we specify by assuming    * @xmath36 is a scalar product on @xmath37 where @xmath30 is either @xmath25 or @xmath31 .",
    "this allows us to define the abstract reference problem stated below .",
    "we call @xmath38 the fine scale reference solution if it solves @xmath39 where @xmath21 describes the method. it is implicitly assumed that problem ( [ fine - grid ] ) is of tremendous computational complexity and can not be solved by available computing resources i n a convenient time .    a simple example of @xmath21 is @xmath40 .",
    "a more complex example is the @xmath21 that stems from a discontinuous galerkin approximation , in which case @xmath21 is different from @xmath35 .",
    "the goal is to approximate problem ( [ fine - grid ] ) by a new problem that reaches a comparable accuracy but one that can be solved with a significantly lower computational demand .      in this subsection",
    ", we introduce the notation that is required in the formulation of the multiscale method .",
    "in particular , we introduce an orthogonal decomposition of the high dimensional solution space @xmath32 into the orthogonal direct sum of a low dimensional space with good approximation properties and a high dimensional remainder space . for this purpose ,",
    "we make the following abstract assumptions .",
    "* @xmath41 denotes a norm on @xmath32 that is equivalent to the norm that is induced by @xmath21 , hence there exist generic constants @xmath42 such that @xmath43 in the same way , @xmath44 denotes a norm on @xmath14 ( equivalent to the norm induced by @xmath35 ) .",
    "furthermore , we let @xmath45 denote the constant with @xmath46 for all @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath45 might degenerate for @xmath48 . *",
    "the coarse space @xmath49 is a low dimensional subspace of @xmath32 that is associated with @xmath22 .",

    "similarly , @xmath15 can be a quasi - interpolation of the clment - type that is related to the @xmath17-projection .",
    "an example for this case is given in equation ( [ def - weighted - clement ] ) below .",
    "alternatively , @xmath15 can be also constructed from local @xmath17-projections as it is done for the classical clment interpolation .",
    "nodal interpolations typically do not satisfy ( a7 ) .    using the assumption that @xmath58 is an isomorphism ( i.e. assumption ( a7 ) ) , a splitting of the space @xmath32 is given by the direct sum @xmath59",

    "furthermore , each of ( [ local - corrector - problem ] ) pertaining to @xmath68 is designed to be elementally independent and thus attributing to its immediate parallelizability .",
    "the corrector problems are solved in a preprocessing step and can be reused for different source terms and for different realization of the lod methods . since @xmath86 is a low dimensional space with locally supported basis functions , solving a problem in @xmath86 is rather inexpensive .",
    "normally , the solutions @xmath87 of ( [ local - corrector - problem ] ) decays exponentially to zero outside of @xmath70 .",
    "this is the reason why we can hope for good approximations even for small patches @xmath69 .",
    "later , we quantify this decay by an abstract assumption ( which is known to hold true for many relevant applications ) .    [ remark - on - projection ] if @xmath88 for all @xmath78 , then @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the orthogonal projection given by ( [ projection - orthogonal ] ) . in this sense , @xmath86 is localization of the space @xmath66 .",

    "in this section , we state the lod in galerkin and in petrov - galerkin formulation along with their respective a priori error estimates and the inf - sup stability . in the last part of this section ,",
    "we give two explicit examples and discuss the advantages of the petrov - galerkin formulation .",
    "subsequently we use the notation @xmath92 to abbreviate @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is a constant that is independent of the mesh sizes @xmath31 and @xmath25 ; and which is independent of the possibly rapid oscillations in @xmath0 .    in order to state proper a priori error estimates ,",
    "we describe the notion of patch size and how the size of @xmath69 affects the final approximation .",
    "all the stated theorems on the error estimates of the lod methods are proved in section  [ section : proofs : pg : lod ] .    [ category - k]let @xmath95 be fixed .",
    "we define patches @xmath69 that consist of the element @xmath70 and @xmath96-layers of coarse element around it . for all @xmath97 , we define element patches in the coarse mesh @xmath22 by @xmath98    the above concept of patch sizes and patch shapes can be also generalized .",

    "however , depending on the localization strategy ( i.e. how @xmath107 is computed ) it is also possible that @xmath110 takes the value @xmath111 and that hence a pollution term of order @xmath109 arises ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.8 ) for a discussion ) . for discontinuous galerkin methods ,",
    "the optimal known order is @xmath112 .",

    "analytically we can make the following observations .",
    "[ quasi - orth ] the inf - sup stability of the lod in petrov - galerkin formulation is a natural property to expect , since we have quasi - orthogonality in @xmath21 of the spaces @xmath86 and @xmath60 .",

    "this means that @xmath135 converges exponentially in @xmath96 to zero , and it is identical to zero for all sufficiently large @xmath96 ( because then @xmath136 ) . writing the pg - lod bilinear form as @xmath137 we see that it is only a small perturbation of the symmetric ( coercive ) g - lod version , where the difference can be bounded by the quasi - orthogonality .",
    "even though the quasi - orthogonality _ suggests _ inf - sup stability , the given assumptions ( a1)-(a8 ) do not seem to be sufficient for rigorously proving it . here",
    ", it seems necessary to leave the abstract setting and to prove the inf - sup stability result for the various lod realizations separately . for simplification",
    ", we therefore make the inf - sup stability to be an additional assumption ( see ( a9 ) below ) .",
    "later we give an example how to prove this assumption for a certain realization of the method .",
    "we also note that the inf - sup stability can be always verified numerically ( for a given @xmath96 ) by investigating the system matrix @xmath138 given by the entries @xmath139 for @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the dimension of @xmath14 and where @xmath142 denotes a basis of @xmath14 .",
    "to check the inf - sup stability we must compute the eigenvalues of @xmath138 . if their real parts are all strictly positive , we have inf - sup stability and the inf - sup constant is identical to the smallest real part of an eigenvalue .",
    "standard approaches for computing the eigenvalues of a non - symmetric matrix are the arnoldi method , the jacobi - davidson method and the non - symmetric lanczos algorithm ( cf .",

    "are fulfilled for this setting , theorems [ t : a - priori - local ] and [ t : a - priori - local - pg ] hold true for the arising method . furthermore , we have @xmath108 and @xmath196 in the estimates , meaning that the @xmath109-pollution in front of the decay term vanishes . we can summarize the result in the following conclusion .    assume the ( continuous galerkin )",
    "setting of this subsection and let @xmath156 denote a petrov - galerkin solution of ( [ lod - problem - eq - pg ] ) . if @xmath197 for @xmath198 , then it holds @xmath199 in particular , the bound is independent of @xmath45 .",
    "the central disadvantage of the galerkin lod is that it requires a communication between solutions of different patches .",
    "consider for instance the assembly of the system matrix that belongs to problem ( [ lod - problem - eq ] ) .",
    "here it is necessary to compute entries of the type @xmath200 which particularly involves the computation of the term @xmath201 where @xmath202 denote two coarse nodal basis functions and @xmath203 and @xmath204 its corresponding supports .",
    "the efficient computation of ( [ problematic - term ] ) requires information about the intersection area of any two patches @xmath69 and @xmath205 .",
    "even if @xmath70 and @xmath206 are not adjacent or close to each other , the intersection of the corresponding patches can be complicated and non - empty .",
    "the drawback becomes obvious : first , these intersection areas must be determined , stored and handled in an efficient way and second , the number of relevant entries of the stiffness matrix ( i.e. the non - zeros ) increases considerably .",
    "note that this also leads to a restriction in the parallelization capabilities , in the sense that the assembly of the stiffness matrix can only be started if the correctors @xmath207 are already computed .",
    "another disadvantage is that the assembly of the right hand side vector associated with @xmath208 in ( [ lod - problem - eq ] ) is much more expensive since it involves the computation of entries @xmath209 .",
    "first , the integration area is @xmath210 instead of typically @xmath203 .",
    "this increases the computational costs . at the same time",
    ", it is also hard to assemble these entries by performing ( typically more efficient ) element - wise computations ( for which each coarse element has to be visited only once ) .",
    "second , @xmath209 involves a quadrature rule of high order , since @xmath207 is rapidly oscillating .",
    "these oscillations must be resolved by the quadrature rule , even if @xmath211 is a purely macroscopic function that can be handled exactly by a low order quadrature . hence , the costs for computing @xmath209 depend indirectly on the oscillations of @xmath0 . finally ,",
    "if the lod shall be applied to a sequence of problems of type ( [ exact - solution ] ) , which only differ in the source term @xmath211 ( or a boundary condition ) , the system matrix can be fully reused , but the complications that come with the right hand side have to be addressed each time again .",
    "the petrov - galerkin formulation of the lod clearly solves these problems without suffering from a loss in accuracy .",
    "in particular :    * the pg - lod does not require any communication between two different patches and the resulting stiffness matrix is sparser than the one for the symmetric lod .",
    "in particular , the entries of the system matrix @xmath212 can be computed with the following algorithm : + + [ algorithm - computing - stiffness - pg - lod ] +    ' '' '' +   + let @xmath212 denote the empty system matrix with entries @xmath213 .",

    "* replacing the source term @xmath211 in ( [ exact - solution ] ) , only involves the re - computation of the terms @xmath215 for coarse nodal basis functions @xmath216 , i.e. the same costs as for the standard fe method on the coarse scale .",
    "furthermore , the choice of the quadrature rule relies purely on @xmath211 , but not on the oscillations of @xmath0 .    besides the previously mentioned advantages , there is still a memory consuming issue left : the storage of the local correctors @xmath217 . these local correctors need to be saved in order to express the final approximation @xmath218 which is spanned by the multiscale basis functions @xmath219 .",
    "as long as we are interested in a good @xmath123-approximation of the solution , this problem seems to be unavoidable .",
    "however , in many applications we can even overcome this difficulty by exploiting another very big advantage of the pg - lod : theorem [ t : a - priori - local - pg ] predicts that alone the coarse part of @xmath218 , denoted by @xmath220 , already exhibits very good @xmath17-approximation properties , i.e. if @xmath194 we have essentially @xmath221 in contrast to @xmath218 , the representation of @xmath222 does only require the classical coarse finite element basis functions .",
    "hence , we can use the algorithm presented earlier , with the difference that we can immediately delete @xmath223 after updating the stiffness matrix . observe",
    "that even if computations have to be repeated for different source terms @xmath211 , this stiffness matrix can be reused again and again . also , if a user is interested in the fine scale behavior in a local region ( but the @xmath223 were already dropped )",
    ", it is still possible to quickly re - compute the desired local corrector for the region .    as an application ,",
    "consider for instance the case that the problem @xmath224 describes the diffusion of a pollutant in groundwater .",
    "here , @xmath1 describes the concentration of the pollutant , @xmath0 the ( rapidly varying ) hydraulic conductivity and @xmath211 a source term describing the injection of the pollutant .",
    "in such a scenario , there is typically not much interest in finding a good approximation of the ( locally fluctuating ) gradient @xmath225 , but rather in the macroscopic behavior of pollutant @xmath1 , i.e. in purely finding a good @xmath17-approximation that allows to conclude where the pollutant spreads .",
    "a similar scenario is the investigation of the properties of a composite material , where @xmath0 describes the heterogenous material and @xmath211 some external force .",
    "again , the interest is in finding an accurate @xmath17-approximation . besides",
    ", the corresponding simulations are typically performed for a variety of different source terms @xmath211 , investigating different scenarios . in this case , the pg - lod yields reliable approximations with very low costs , independent of the structure of @xmath0 .",

    "the coarse space @xmath49 is defined in the same fashion with @xmath22 instead of @xmath24 . note that these spaces are no subspaces of @xmath263 as in the previous example .",

    "however , the proofs in @xcite directly generalize to the local correctors @xmath99 given by equation .",
    "more precisely , following the proofs in @xcite it becomes evident that the availability of the required decay property ( a8 ) purely relies on the fact , that the right hand side in the local problems is only locally supported ( with a support that remains fixed , even if the patch size decreases ) .",

    ", the discontinuous galerkin lod in petrov - galerkin formulation fulfills the assumptions of our framework ( up to a discussion on ( a9 ) ) .",
    "the advantages that we discussed in the previous subsection for the petrov - galerkin continuous finite element method in terms of memory and efficiency remains true .",
    "however , for the pg dg - lod there is a very important additional advantage .",
    "it is known that the classical dg method has the feature of local mass conservation with respect to the elements of the underlying mesh .",
    "this can be easily checked by testing with the indicator function of an element @xmath70 in the variational formulation of the method .",
    "the local mass conservation is a highly desired property for various flow and transport problems .",
    "however , the dg - lod does not preserve this property , since the indicator function of an element ( whether coarse or fine ) is not in the space @xmath86 .",
    "this problem is solved in the pg dg - lod , where we can test with any element from @xmath14 and in particular with the indicator function of a coarse element .",
    "hence , in contrast to the symmetric dg - lod , the pg dg - lod is locally mass conservative with respect to coarse elements @xmath68 .",
    "this allows for example the coupling of the pg dg - lod for an elliptic problem with the solver for a hyperbolic conservation law , which was not possible before without relinquishing the mass conservation .",
    "we discuss this further in the next subsection .      in this subsection , we investigate an application of the petrov - galerkin dg - lod in the simulation of two - phase flow as governed by the buckley - leverett equation .",
    "specifically , the lod framework is utilized to solve the pressure equation , which is an elliptic boundary value problem , and is coupled with a solver for a hyperbolic conservation law .",
    "the buckley - leverett equation can be used to model two - phase flow in a porous medium .",
    "generally , the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids is driven by the law of mass balance for the two fluids : @xmath300 \\quad \\mbox{for } \\alpha = w , n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 is a computational domain , @xmath301 $ ] a time interval , the unknowns @xmath302 $ ] describe the saturations of a wetting and a non - wetting fluid and @xmath303 and @xmath304 are the corresponding fluxes . furthermore , @xmath305 describes the porosity and @xmath306 and @xmath307 are two source terms .",
    "darcy s law relates the fluxes with the two unknown pressures @xmath308 and @xmath309 by @xmath310 here , @xmath206 denotes the hydraulic conductivity , @xmath311 and @xmath312 the relative permeabilities depending on the saturations , @xmath313 and @xmath314 the viscosities , @xmath315 and @xmath316 the densities and @xmath317 the gravity vector . the saturations are coupled via @xmath318 and a relation between the two pressures is typically given by the capillary pressure relation @xmath319 for a monotonically decreasing capillary pressure curve @xmath320 . in this case",
    ", we obtain the full two - phase flow system , which consists of two strongly coupled , possibly degenerate parabolic equations .",
    "however , if we neglect the gravity and the capillary pressure ( i.e. assume that @xmath321 ) , the system reduces to the so called buckley - leverett system with an elliptic pressure equation and an hyperbolic equation for the saturation : @xmath322 where we have @xmath323 , @xmath324 , the total mobility @xmath325 , the flux @xmath326 and the flux function @xmath327 . the total source is given by @xmath328 .",
    "observe that ( [ bl - system ] ) is obtained from ( [ tpf - system ] ) by summing up the equations for the saturations , using @xmath329 .",
    "an application for which neglecting the capillary pressure is typically justified are oil recovery processes . here , a replacement fluid , such as water or liquid carbon dioxide , is injected with very high rates into a reservoir to move oil towards a production well .",
    "however , often oil is trapped at interfaces of a low and a high conductivity region .",
    "this oil would become inaccessible which is why detailed simulations are required before the replacement fluid can be actually injected .",
    "depending on how the mobilities are chosen , the hyperbolic buckley - leverett problem can have one or more weak solutions ( c.f .",
    "one approach for solving the problem numerically is to use an operator splitting technique as proposed in @xcite , which is more well - known as the _ ( im)plicit ( p)ressure ( e)xplicit ( s)aturation _ , i.e. , impes . here",
    ", the hyperbolic buckley - leverett problem is treated with an explicit time stepping method where the flux velocity @xmath330 is kept constant for a certain time interval and then updated by solving the elliptic problem with the saturation from the previous time step ( see figure  [ fig : os - impes ] for an illustration ) .",
    "alternatively , depending on the type of the flux function @xmath211 , the hyperbolic problem can be also solved implicitly with a suitable numerical scheme for conservation laws ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) where the flux @xmath330 arising from the darcy equation is , as in the previous case , only updated every fixed number of time steps .",
    "observe that the difficulties produced by the multiscale character of the problem are primarily related to the elliptic part of the problem . once the darcy problem is solved to update the flux velocity , the grid for solving the hyperbolic problem can be significantly coarsened .",
    "the reason is that @xmath331 is possibly still rapidly oscillating , but the relative amplitude of the oscillations is expected to remain small . in other words , just like for standard elliptic homogenization problems , @xmath330 behaves like an upscaled quantity @xmath332 with effective / homogenized functions @xmath333 , @xmath334 and @xmath335 .",
    "any realization of the lod involves to solve a number of local problems that help us to construct the low dimensional space @xmath86 .",
    "one might consider to update this space every time that the darcy problem has to be solved with a new saturation .",
    "however , since @xmath336 is essentially macroscopic , it is generally sufficient to construct the space only once for @xmath337 and reuse the result for every time step .",
    "this makes solving the elliptic multiscale problem much cheaper after the multiscale space is assembled",
    ". a justification for this reusing of the basis can be e.g. found in @xcite where it was shown that oscillations coming from advective terms can be often neglected in the construction of a multiscale basis . under certain assumptions ,",
