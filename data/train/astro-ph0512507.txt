    "in the last decade stellar streams in and around the milky way , which are possible debris from the disruption of satellite galaxies during the hierarchical assembly of our galaxy , have become an active topic of investigation for several reasons .",
    "firstly , large scale ccd surveys have provided unprecedented evidence of accretion and tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies around large spirals in the local group ( milky way : see majewski 2004 ; m31 : ibata et al .",
    "2002 and beyond : pohlen et al .",
    "2004 ) . secondly , because tidal streams provide strong constraints on the potential of host galaxies , it is possible to estimate the shape of dark matter halos on large scales in contrast to traditional tracers , such as hi or stellar kinematics ( see sackett et al .",
    "1999 for a review ) , which provide estimates on relatively small scales .",
    "the expected shape of dark matter halos depends on the nature of dark matter particles ( see , for example , dubinsky & calberg 1991 , yoshida et al . 2000 and dav et al .",
    "2001 for shape estimates for cold , self - interacting and hot dark matter models , respectively ) , tidal streams represent a useful tool to discriminate between different paradigms .",
    "in addition , tidal stream properties also depend on the mass and internal structure of its progenitor ( e.g johnston , sackett & bullock 2001 and law , johnston & majewski 2004 , hereinafter ljm ) , which ultimately results in a complementary way of estimating the progenitor mass and therefore its mass - to - light ratio .",
    "finally , tidal streams can be used to determine the position of the progenitor if this has not previously been detected ( e.g. font et al .",
    "2004 , pearrubia et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the formation of tidal streams is , conceptually , a simple process : along its orbit , a stellar system crosses regions where the tidal force of its host galaxy supplies kinetic energy to the initially bound particles .",
    "if the energy gain is large enough , particles can become unbound and escape from the host system , forming two sub - systems which are kinematically well differentiated : the leading and the trailing tails which , as their names indicate , precede and follow , respectively , the progenitor in its orbit .",
    "the orbital evolution of stripped particles is initially similar to that of the progenitor ( e.g. lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 , johnston 1998 ) although , as they evolve in the host galaxy potential , orbits diverge from each other monotonically with time .",
    "however , even after a large number of orbital periods , tidal stream particles and the progenitor system reside in well - defined regions of the constant of motion space ( helmi & white 1999 ) , therefore attesting a common origin .    the complexity of the stream formation and evolution forces the use of n - body calculations in most cases .",
    "the existing work can be divided into a ) live n - body simulations , where the host galaxy is formed by a given number of particles initially in equilibrium and b ) simulations where the host galaxy is represented by a non - responsive potential .",
    "whereas the former takes into account the host galaxy s response to the satellite , the later neglects this in order to save computational resources for extensive orbit surveys .",
    "+ however , none of the n - body simulations of tidal stream formation and evolution to date has accounted for the overall build - up of the host galaxy during the 110 gyr that the stream formation may take . yet , in the commonly accepted hierarchical scenario , host galaxies experience large changes in mass , size and shape during their history and hence a tidal stream evolving in an unchanging host galaxy can only approximate recent epochs .",
    "the main goal of this contribution is to address the effect that the secular evolution of the host galaxy induces on the formation , evolution and interpretation of tidal streams .",
    "specifically , we will explore whether the present - day structure of an extensive tidal stream can constrain the past history of the host s gravitational potential .",
    "in addition to the secular overall mass and size growth of the host s halo , we will also examine the influence of dark matter substructures on tidal streams ( ibata et al . 2002 and johnston , spergel & haydn 2002 ) .",
    "cdm cosmology predicts a large number of sub - structures in a galaxy - sized halo , many more than the number of observed dwarf galaxies ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al .",
    "recently , it has been proposed that the process of re - ionization in the universe would lead to a significant decrease in the number of `` visible '' sub - structures ( bullock , kravtsov & weinberg 2000 , benson et al . 2002 , somerville 2002 , tully et al .",
    "2002 ) , while keeping the total number of sub - structures unaltered .",
    "this process would establish a minimum mass ( corresponding to a minimum circular velocity of @xmath2 km / s ) above which gravitationally bound systems would be able to retain baryonic matter and , thus , to form stars .",
    "+ the properties of kinematically cold tidal stream are strongly sensitive to the lumpiness of the galaxy potential ( ibata et al .",
    "2002 , johnston , spergel & haydn 2002 ) as repeated encounters with dark matter sub - structures alter the energy and angular momentum distribution of tidal stream particles , leading to hotter , broadly dispersed streams .",
    "tidal streams appear to be a unique laboratory to determine the presence of dark matter clumps in galaxy halos .",
    "firstly , because the effects of those clumps on tidal streams are purely gravitational ( and so , independent of whether sub - structures enclose baryons or not ) and , secondly , because tidal streams can be detected on large scales and can be as old as the host galaxy , and may therefore provide information on the number and spatial distribution of bound sub - structures at different epochs .",
    "yet , the calculations mentioned above do not take into account the evolution of the spatial distribution nor the mass loss of substructures , which may weaken the influence of substructures on the tidal stream evolution .",
    "in this paper we focus on tidal streams in the milky way simply because only for our galaxy can streams be resolved into stars and accurate phase - space information gathered .",
    "the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : galmod ] we describe our models for the milky way potential and for the satellite galaxies that are disrupted to form tidal streams ;  [ sec : code ] details our n - body code used for evolving satellite orbits . ",

",
    "[ sec : clumps ] examines the influence of dark matter substructures of these tidal streams . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : disc ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the host galaxy system is described by a time - dependent gravitational potential .",
    "our galaxy model consists of a miyamoto - nagai ( 1975 ) disc , a hernquist ( 1990 ) bulge and a navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 ) dark matter halo ( hereafter , nfw halo ) .    the gravitational potential of each of those components in cylindrical coordinates is : @xmath3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are time - independent , but the halo potential @xmath6 evolves as described below .",
    "there , @xmath7 are the virial and scale radii , respectively , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the potential of an axi - symmetric nfw halo was calculated from chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) using elliptic coordinates @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the axis - ratio of iso - density surfaces . in this contribution",
    ", we shall denote _ oblate _ and _ prolate _ halos as those with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "for spherical halos eq .",
    "( [ eq : phih ] ) reduces to @xmath14    following johnston et al .",
    "( 1999 ) we fix the disc and bulge parameters as @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17kpc , @xmath18 kpc and @xmath19kpc .",
    "the milky way halo parameters at @xmath20 were taken from klypin , zhao & somerville ( 2002 ) being @xmath21 , @xmath22kpc , @xmath23kpc , which leads to a concentration at the present epoch of @xmath24 .",
    "additionally , we have defined a characteristic velocity , energy and angular momentum throughout this contribution , which have the values @xmath25 km / s , @xmath26 ( km / s)@xmath27 and @xmath28 kpc  km / s .",
    "our selection of the different milky way components leads to a galaxy potential that is aspherical everywhere .",
    "note that for the gravitational potential at the present epoch , the only parameter that is varied in this work is the halo s density axis - ratio ( @xmath11 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpot ] we plot the flattening of the _ total _ galaxy potential as a function of distance and halo axis - ratio .",
    "one can clearly distinguish three regions : ( i ) the innermost region with @xmath29 dominated by the spherical bulge component , ( ii ) an intermediate region , @xmath30 kpc , where the disk potential dominates , so that the galaxy potential has an oblate shape ( @xmath31 ) and ( iii ) the outer regions , @xmath32 kpc , where the halo potential dominates .",
    "some caveats must be kept in mind when using this simplistic milky way model : + firstly , we have not included the evolution of the baryonic components .",
    "observations at high redshift have shown that disc galaxies evolve in mass and size ( e.g. trujillo & pohlen 2005 , barden et al . 2005 ) , which may induce effects similar to those of the varying halo potential on tidal streams .",
    "moreover , the disc and bulge formation also changes the dark matter distribution , mostly in the inner halo region , as has been shown by several authors ( e.g. , dubinsky 1994 , klypin , zhao & somerville 2002 ) .",
    "however , the self - consistent evolution of our galaxy and its effects on tidal streams would require the use of large n - body cosmological simulations , beyond the scope of this paper . here",
    ", we shall merely examine tidal streams in a milky way - like galaxy , where only the dark matter component evolves .",
    "+ secondly , this evolution of our milky way model ignores any feed - back processes that satellite galaxies may induce on the host system .      in cold dark matter cosmogonies , halos grow hierarchically in mass and size owing to mergers of less massive systems .",
    "the process is stochastic in detail and is described by the merger tree of a halo .",
    "however , the average properties that determine the halo density profile at a given epoch have been studied exhaustively , both analytically and numerically , showing a smooth change with redshift or epoch . in this framework",
    "it is possible to trace back the evolution of a halo from its present density distribution .    for the mean mass evolution wechsler et al .",

    "@xmath38 acts simply as a normalization constant in the fit of @xmath39 ; since its value can be arbitrarily chosen , we therefore fix @xmath40 as in wechsler et al .",
    "+ these authors also show that the average concentration of halos can be fit at any given time by the expression @xmath41 for a halo concentration of @xmath42 at @xmath20 , for the milky way this fixes the formation epoch to @xmath43 ( using s=2 ) .",
    "bullock et al . (",
    "2001 ) have shown that the mean evolution of the virial radius can be expressed as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the virial over - density , which can be written as ( bryan & norman 1998 ) @xmath46 - 39 [ \\omega(z)-1]^2}{\\omega(z ) } , \\label{eq : delv}\\ ] ] and @xmath47 is the mass density of the universe @xmath48 we have assumed for this study a @xmath1cdm universe by fixing @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "( [ eq : mhevol ] ) ,  ( [ eq : c ] ) and  ( [ eq : rv ] ) determine the evolution of the halo potential @xmath6 shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phih ] ) .",
    "the stochastic growth of dark matter halos through mergers with smaller halos implies a tight correlation between the properties of the host halos and their merger trees .",
    "in addition to the overall ( smooth ) mass growth outlined in section  [ sec : he ] , we also analyze the effects of dark matter sub - structures on tidal stream evolution by including an additional force component induced by these systems .",
    "we generate initial conditions for our calculations by constructing merger trees for an ensemble of overall identical dark matter halos identified at @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , we take at @xmath20 dark matter halos of mass @xmath52 , @xmath53 kpc and @xmath42 . following the method of cole et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we construct a statistical realization of the merging history of these halos back to high redshift , assuming a @xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and an inflationary initial power spectrum ( i.e. @xmath57 ) . at each point in time",
    ", we identify the most massive progenitor of the @xmath20 halo and classify this as the `` host '' halo at that redshift .",
    "we then identify halos which are about to merge with the host at each time and label these as new satellites .",
    "based on such merger trees , we record the virial mass , virial velocity and concentration of the host halo ( assumed to have an nfw density profile ) at each epoch .",
    "we also record the same information for each satellite along with the epoch of each merging event .",
    "the initial orbit for each satellite is set by choosing an initial position at random on the surface of a sphere with radius equal to @xmath58 of the host halo , while the initial velocity is chosen from the distribution found by benson ( 2004 ) for @xmath20 in @xmath1cdm cosmologies .    in this way we generate both the formation history of the host halo and the properties of the infalling population of satellites .",
    "these are used as inputs to our model for the evolution of substructures ( pearrubia & benson 2005 ) .",
    "the outcome is nine different merger trees of a milky way - like galaxy for which , at each time - step , we have the position , velocity , mass , virial and scale radii of all subhalos with masses above @xmath59 .",
    "the actual disruption of satellites is modeled by ` live ' ( i.e. self - consistent , self - gravitating ) n - body realizations of satellites in an evolving , but non - responsive , halo potential .",
    "we also include perturbations from the ensemble of dark matter subhalos .",
    "we have realized our numerical models of satellite galaxies with king profiles ( king 1966 ) , which approximate the light profile of the galaxy s low - mass satellites ( e.g. irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) . the high mass - to - light ratios measured in dwarf galaxies ( such as ursa minor and draco , see mateo 1998 , kleyna et al .",
    "2004 , locas , mamon & prada 2005 , muoz et al . 2005 ) indicate that these systems are dark matter dominated , but with a dark matter profile that is not well determined .",
    "+ as zhao ( 2004 ) showed , the mass and orbital evolution are fairly sensitive to the specific mass profile we assume for our satellites , an aspect that must be kept in mind , but it is not pursued further here .    for the initial satellite structure we assume a king profile with a dimensionless central potential @xmath60 , or concentration parameter @xmath61 , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the king and tidal radii , respectively .",
    "our satellite models have @xmath64 particles .",
    "the initial mass and tidal radius are chosen such that the mass at the present epoch is @xmath65 in all of our calculations .",
    "details of how to make this choice are given in section  [ sec : calc ] .",
    "the force acting on each satellite particle in our simulations has four components : 1 ) the gravity of all other satellite particles ; 2 ) the force from the smooth , non - responsive milky way potential ; 3 ) dynamical friction on the still bound satellite portion and 4 ) the time - dependent forces from subhalos .    to calculate",

    "superbox uses a leap - frog scheme with a constant time - step of @xmath91 myr , which is about @xmath92th the dynamical time of our most massive satellite model .",

    "current theoretical models of the two largest , brightest streams in the milky way ( sgr : ljm ; monoceros : pearrubia et al .",
    "2005 ) indicate that there is no detection of tidal debris that became unbound more than 2 - 3 gyr ago .",
    "finally , stream tails are not located on the progenitor s orbital plane ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : orbplane ] ) , which further complicates tagging of debris as part of a known stellar system and needs of accurate stream models in order to determine a possible common origin and to estimate the stream s age .",
    "+ in the future , the most powerful method to search for ancient debris in the halo should come with the next generation of astrometric satellites , which will permit analysis of tidal streams in the constant - of - motion space , thus , providing the most straightforward way to identify tidal debris independently of the stream age . however , it is important to remark that observational errors may introduce strong limitations , as indicated by brown et al .",
    "possibilities of identifying satellite remnants in the milky way halo are considerably reduced after taking into account the observational errors expected for the gaia catalogue and the large number of background stars .",
