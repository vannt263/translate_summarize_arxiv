    "the aim of this paper is to give a survey on the classification of vector bundles and torsion free sheaves on singular projective curves of arithmetic genus one .",
    "we include new proofs of some classical results on coherent sheaves on smooth elliptic curves , which use the technique of derived categories and fourier - mukai transforms and are simpler than the original ones . some results about singular curves are new or at least presented in a new framework .",
    "this research project had several sources of motivation and inspiration .",
    "our study of vector bundles on degenerations of elliptic curves was originally motivated by the mckay correspondence for minimally elliptic surface singularities @xcite .",
    "here we use as the main technical tool methods from the representation theory of associative algebras , in particular , a key tool in our approach to classification problems is played by the technique of `` representations of bunches of chains '' or `` gelfand problems '' @xcite . at last , but not least we want to mention that our research was strongly influenced by ideas and methods coming from the homological mirror symmetry @xcite .",
    "many different questions concerning properties of the category of vector bundles and coherent sheaves on degenerations of elliptic curves are encoded in the following general set - up :        let @xmath0 be a flat family of projective curves of arithmetic genus one such that the fiber @xmath1 is smooth for generic @xmath2 and singular for @xmath3 .",
    "what happens with the derived category @xmath4 , when @xmath5 ?    in order to start working on this question one has to consider the absolute case first , where the base @xmath6 is @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , one has to describe indecomposable vector bundles and indecomposable objects of the derived category of coherent sheaves on degenerations of elliptic curves and develop a technique to calculate homomorphism and extension spaces between indecomposable torsion free sheaves as well as various operations on them , like tensor products and dualizing .    for the first time we face",
    "this sort of problems when dealing with the mckay correspondence for _ minimally elliptic singularities_. namely , let @xmath8 be the spectrum of a complete ( or analytical ) two - dimensional minimally elliptic singularity , @xmath9 its minimal resolution , and @xmath10 the exceptional divisor . due to a construction of kahn @xcite ,",
    "the functor @xmath11 establishes a bijection between the reflexive @xmath12modules ( maximal cohen - macaulay modules ) and the generically globally generated indecomposable vector bundles on @xmath10 with vanishing first cohomology .",
    "denotes the restriction to @xmath10 ]    a typical example of a minimally elliptic singularity is a @xmath14singularity , given by the equation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 . if @xmath18 , then this singularity is _ simple elliptic _ and the exceptional divisor @xmath10 is a smooth elliptic curve .",
    "thus , in this case a description of indecomposable maximal cohen - macaulay modules follows from atiyah s classification of vector bundles on elliptic curves @xcite .",
    "the main result of atiyah s paper essentially says :    an indecomposable vector bundle @xmath19 on an elliptic curve @xmath10 is uniquely determined by its rank @xmath20 , degree @xmath21 and determinant @xmath22 .    in section [ subsec :",
    "ellcurves ] we give a new proof of this result .",
    "however , if @xmath23 , then @xmath24 is a so - called _ cusp singularity _ and in this case @xmath10 is a cycle of @xmath25 projective lines @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes a rational curve with one node .",
    "a complete classification of indecomposable vector bundles and torsion free sheaves on these curves in the case of an arbitrary base field @xmath28 was obtained by drozd and greuel @xcite . for algebraically closed fields",
    "there is the following description , which we prove in section [ subsec : prop ] .",

    "if @xmath19 is locally free , then there is an tale covering @xmath31 , a line bundle @xmath32 and a natural number @xmath33 such that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an indecomposable vector bundle on @xmath36 , recursively defined by the sequences @xmath37 2 .   if @xmath19 is not locally free then there exists a finite map @xmath38 and a line bundle @xmath39 ( where @xmath30 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are determined by @xmath19 ) such that @xmath42 .",
    "this classification is completely analogous to oda s description of vector bundles on smooth elliptic curves @xcite and provides quite simple rules for the computation of the decomposition of the tensor product of any two vector bundles into a direct sum of indecomposable ones .",
    "it allows to describe the dual sheaf of an indecomposable torsion free sheaf as well as the dimensions of homomorphism and extension spaces between indecomposable vector bundles ( and in particular , their cohomology ) , see @xcite .",
    "we carry out these computations in section [ subsec : prop ] .",
    "however , the way we prove this theorem , essentially uses ideas from representation theory and the technique of matrix problems @xcite . using a similar approach , theorem",
    "[ thm : classification ] was generalized by burban and drozd @xcite to classify indecomposable complexes of the bounded ( from the right ) derived category of coherent sheaves @xmath43 on a cycle of projective lines @xmath44 see also @xcite for the case of associative algebras .",
    "the situation turns out to be quite different for other singular projective curves of arithmetic genus one .",
    "for example , in the case of a cuspidal rational curve @xmath45 even a classification of indecomposable semi - stable vector bundles of a given slope is a _ representation - wild _ problem.linear category @xmath46 over an algebraically closed field @xmath28 is called wild if it contains as a full subcategory the category of finite - dimensional representations of _ any _ associative algebra .",
    "] however , if we restrict our attention only on stable vector bundles , then this problem turns out to be _ tame _ again .",
    "moreover , the combinatorics of the answer is essentially the same as for smooth and nodal weierstra curves is algebraically closed and @xmath47 then it can be written in the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "it is singular if and only if @xmath50 and unless @xmath51 the singularity is a node , whereas in the case @xmath51 the singularity is a cusp . ] :    [ see @xcite ] let @xmath10 be a cuspidal cubic curve over an algebraically closed field @xmath28 then a stable vector bundle @xmath19 is completely determined by its rank @xmath20 , its degree @xmath52 that should be coprime , and its determinant @xmath53 .",
    "the technique of matrix problems is a very convenient tool for the study of vector bundles on a given singular projective rational curve of arithmetic genus one .",
    "however , to investigate the behavior of the category of coherent sheaves on genus one curves in families one needs other methods .",
    "one possible approach is provided by the technique of derived categories and fourier - mukai transforms @xcite , see section [ subsec : fmt ] .",

    "there exists a point @xmath60 and @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "this theorem shows a fundamental difference between a nodal and a cuspidal weierstra curve .",

    "the correspondence between sky - scraper sheaves and semi - stable vector bundles on irreducible weierstra curves was first discovered by friedman , morgan and witten @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and afterwards widely used in the physical literature under the name `` spectral cover construction '' .",

    "in this section we review some classical results about vector bundles on smooth curves .",
    "however , we provide non - classical proofs which , as we think , are simpler and fit well in our approach to coherent sheaves over singular curves . the behavior of the category of vector bundles on a smooth projective curve @xmath73 is controlled by its genus @xmath74 .    if @xmath75 then @xmath73 is a projective line @xmath76 and any locally free sheaf on it splits into a direct sum of line bundles @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",

    "a modern , and in our opinion more conceptual way to prove atiah s result uses the language of derived categories and is due to lenzing and meltzer @xcite . in the case of an algebraically closed field of characteristics zero an alternative description of indecomposable vector bundles via tale coverings",
