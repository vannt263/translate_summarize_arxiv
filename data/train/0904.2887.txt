    "the question of the distribution of the cosmic rays ( crs ) and of the cr sources in the galaxy was addressed extensively by many authors ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "secondary cr data tell us that cr protons and nuclei , that are accelerated by galactic sources , have a confinement time in the galaxy of about @xmath1  years at gev energies , which decreases with increasing energy . during this time the particles accelerated by individual sources mix together ,",
    "lose memory of their origin , and contribute to the bulk of galactic crs known as the cosmic ray _",
    "sea _ or cr background .",
    "direct measurements provide the cr spectrum and flux only in the vicinity of the solar system and the level of the cr spectrum and flux in other regions of the galaxy is unknown . in order to investigate the cr level in distant regions of the galaxy and the distribution of galactic cr sources",
    "one can start assuming that the cr flux and spectrum measured locally is representative of the typical cr flux and spectrum present throughout the galaxy , except in the proximity of isolated cr sources .",
    "the implications of such an assumption are firstly , that there exists a definable cr _ sea _ of homogenised and isotropised crs , far from any of the kpc - scale uniformly and continuously distributed cr sources , which is the typical cr flux and spectrum in the galaxy ; and secondly , that the earth sits in a typical region far from any source where this _ sea _ can be measured directly .",
    "although the @xmath2 years diffusion time of crs in the galaxy seems to imply the existence of the _ sea _ , in principle there could indeed be a _",
    "sea _ of crs in the galaxy , but the earth could be located close to a so far undetected cr source , so that the locally measured flux is therefore substantially higher than the _ sea _ and the spectrum substantially harder , and the local values are therefore not representative of the typical case . alternatively ,",
    "if the cr sources are distributed quite densely , on sub - kpc scales in the galaxy , there may not really be a _ sea _",
    "cr spectrum at all .",
    "the local values of cr flux and spectrum would then vary strongly depending mostly on the proximity to the cr sources in any particular region . in this case",
    "the flux value at the earth could be lower or higher , and the spectrum softer or harder , than any given distant region .",
    "finally , it could be that the cr sources are so densely distributed in the galaxy , that there might exist strong gradients in the cr spectrum , depending mostly on the proximity to the cr sources in any particular region , and the earth might by chance be located unusually far from any source and thus the locally measured flux and spectrum are lower and softer than typical values found elsewhere .",
    "whilst diffusing through the galaxy , crs interact with ambient matter ( both molecular and atomic ) and produce @xmath0-rays   through inelastic collisions",
    ". this emission has long been recognised by many authors as a unique probe of the parent cr distribution because the resultant @xmath0-ray  emissivity is a function only of the matter density and the cr spectrum @xcite .",
    "for instance @xcite investigated the galacto - centric distribution of cosmic rays .",
    "they defined four intervals in the galacto - centric radius , for which they calculated the column densities of atomic and molecular hydrogen . by comparing the @xmath0-ray intensities with the predicted emissivities , they derived an exponential distribution for the cosmic rays in the galaxy . in the paper by @xcite the cr flux used for calculating the @xmath0-ray flux",
    "is varied position to position by multiplying by a `` cosmic ray enhancement factor '' @xmath3 , which is derived by convolving the matter distribution with a gaussian distribution whose width is an adjustable parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the cosmic ray enhancement factor @xmath3 takes a value ranging from 0.1 to 1.6 .",
    "the cr flux in the galaxy varies significantly to that measured in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the most comprehensive numerical model , which includes particle production and propagation in the galaxy , is galprop @xcite .",
    "galprop is designed to perform cosmic - ray propagation calculations for nuclei , antiprotons , electrons and positrons , and computes diffuse @xmath0-rays and synchrotron emission . in galprop the cr propagation equation is solved numerically on a spatial grid , either in 2d with cylindrical symmetry in the galaxy or in full 3d . the numerical solution proceeds in time until a steady - state is reached .",
    "normalisation of protons , helium and electrons to experimental data is provided ( all other isotopes are determined by the source composition and propagation ) .",
    "@xmath0-rays and synchrotron are computed using interstellar gas data ( for pion - decay and bremsstrahlung ) and the interstellar radiation fields ( isrf ) model ( for inverse compton ) .",
    "spectra of all species on the chosen grid and the @xmath0-ray and synchrotron sky - maps are output in a standard astronomical format for comparison with data .",
    "the approach adopted by @xcite to include effects of cr flux variations in the galaxy is to calculate the propagation effect from cr sources , which results in variation of cr flux in our galaxy @xcite .",
    "the simulated @xmath0-ray flux is then the background , which must be subtracted to recognise the sites of concentrated excess @xmath0-ray emission in a detector data , such as in fermi data .",
    "interestingly , based on egret data @xcite the @xmath0-ray  emission from the inner galaxy ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as defined in @xcite ) at energies greater than about 1  gev exceeds , by some 60@xmath7 , the intensity predicted by model calculations @xcite .",
    "recent observations , performed by the lat instrument on board the fermi satellite , show that the spectra of the galactic diffuse emission at mev - gev energies , at least at intermediate latitudes @xcite , can be explained by cosmic - ray propagation models based on local observations of cosmic - ray electron and nuclei spectra . on the other hand , at tev energies",
    "the spectral features of the @xmath0-ray  emission detected by hess from the galactic centre ( gc ) region @xcite , and the emission measured by milagro from the cygnus region @xcite , suggest that the cr flux might significantly vary in the different locations of the galaxy .",
    "in this paper we seek to compare the cr flux and spectrum observed at the earth to the cr flux and spectrum in specific distant regions , derived from observations of @xmath0-rays  emitted by crs propagating through molecular clouds .",
    "we first present not publicly available co observations obtained with the nanten telescope for a significant and interesting part of the galactic plane .",
    "we then demonstrate that the nanten data in combination with the fermi data allow meaningful studies of deviations of the cosmic ray flux from the average one .",
    "the level of the _ sea _ of lower energy crs ( @xmath8 few gev ) has been traced by the ionisation rate inferred from different molecular species seen in molecular clouds @xcite . the level of the cr _ sea _ above 1 gev",
    "will then be inferred by combining the @xmath0-ray  emission from molecular clouds with the data from the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) survey of the galactic atomic hydrogen @xcite and from the nanten survey of galactic molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "studying the @xmath0-ray emission from single molecular clouds the differential , local distribution of the cosmic ray flux can be inferred .",
    "the detection of even a single under - luminous cloud with respect to the predictions based on the local cr density would cast severe doubt on the assumption that the level of the observed cr flux is representative of the average cr flux and spectrum in the galaxy .    in section [ sec : interactions ] we will present new data on the distribution of the molecular hydrogen from the region of the inner galaxy , which spans galactic longitude @xmath9 and galactic latitude @xmath10 , obtained by the nanten collaboration .",
    "we will also briefly review the results of the lab survey of the galactic atomic hydrogen .",
    "a description of our approach will be given in section [ sec : testing ] .",
    "the method will be here applied to the region of the galactic plane described above to provide a proof - of - concept. a more comprehensive study on a larger scale will be discussed in a future paper .",
    "some predictions concerning the @xmath0-ray  and cosmic ray fluxes from molecular clouds including their uncertainties are given in section [ sec : results ] , where we will also discuss the observational prospects for present and future observatories .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the nanten instrument is a 4  m millimetre / sub - millimetre telescope which has surveyed the southern sky using the @xmath11co ( j=10 ) emission line at 115.271  ghz ( @xmath12  mm ) .",
    "the angular resolution at this frequency is 4@xmath13 , with a mass sensitivity of about 100  m@xmath14 at the galactic centre ( gc ) , assuming a distance of 8.5  kpc for the gc .",

    "there are two distance solutions for each radial velocity in the inner galaxy . in order to resolve this near - far distance ambiguity ,",
    "the method by @xcite is used .",
    "the principle uncertainty in the determination of the distances in the nanten data - set comes from errors in the accuracy of the radial velocity estimates .",
    "the combination of turbulence and peculiar proper motions of the gas causes spectral line broadening , which introduces uncertainties in the radial velocity , that can be as large as 15  km / s ( a giant molecular cloud typically shows velocity width of 10 km / s , and the cloud - cloud motion is 3 - 3.9 km / s @xcite ) .",
    "this corresponds to an uncertainty of less than 2 kpc in the distance .",
    "the dependence of the uncertainties in the radial velocity on the particular location is small for our dataset , since the longitude range used here includes disk gas , and excludes the galactic centre and molecular ring . for disk gas",
    ", it is , in fact , unlikely to have significant systematic variation in either cloud - cloud velocity dispersion or typical line widths with location .",
    "correspondingly , the distance error arising from molecular gas velocity dispersion is likely to be fairly constant throughout our data sample .",
    "figure [ fig2 ]  ( _ left _ ) and [ fig2 ]  ( _ right _ ) show nanten observations of the @xmath11co ( j=10 ) emission line from a large area of the galactic plane .",

    "inspection of figure [ fig2 ]  ( _ left _ ) shows that the molecular material is predominantly confined to @xmath23 of the plane .",
    "the longitude span places this region in between the galactic centre and the norma arm @xcite so that there should be no contamination from depth effects from looking down an arm .",
    "this is reflected in the distribution of heliocentric distance in the region in figure [ fig2 ]  ( _ right _ ) , which shows the distance as a function of position .",
    "figure [ fig2 ]  ( _ right _ ) shows , in fact , a moment 1 map of the region , which is @xmath24/\\sum[i]$ ] , where @xmath25 is the intensity and @xmath26 is the distance of the gas and has units of kilo - parsec .",
    "there are a few regions of emission which are very far away ( corresponding to the dark pixels ) .",
    "however , these tend to be isolated , small segments on the edge of the plane , and hence they should contribute a negligible amount to the @xmath0-ray  emissivity . specifically , figure [ fig2 ]  ( _ right _ ) shows that the bulk of the observed emission originates at distances of @xmath27  kpc , whilst there is some emission , mainly confined to the central regions of the galactic plane , which are at greater distances .",
    "we use data from the leiden / argentine / bonn ( lab ) galactic hi survey @xcite for the distribution of the atomic hydrogen .",
    "the lab observations were centred on the 1420  mhz ( @xmath28  cm ) line with a bandwidth of 5  mhz .",
    "the velocity axis spans @xmath29  km  s@xmath22 to @xmath30  km  s@xmath22 giving a final velocity resolution of @xmath31  km  s@xmath22 .",
    "the data combines observations from three telescopes at a common resolution of @xmath32 with a final sensitivity of @xmath33  k. we used the same procedure described in [ sec : nanten ] to transform the velocity axis into distance .",
    "the emissivity of molecular clouds located far away from cr sources , so called _ passive _ molecular clouds , i.e. clouds which are illuminated by the supposedly existing cr background , can be used to probe the level of the cr _ sea _ @xcite .",
    "given that the @xmath0-ray  -emission from the molecular cloud depends only upon the total mass of the cloud , m , and its distance from the earth , @xmath26 , the cr flux , @xmath34 , in the cloud is uniquely determined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the integral @xmath0-ray  flux from the cloud and @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the gas number density and @xmath39 the volume of the cloud . under the assumption",
    "that the cr background is equal to the locally observed cr flux , the calculated @xmath0-ray flux from the cloud can be compared to the observed @xmath0-ray flux in order to probe the cr spectrum in distant regions of the galaxy .",
    "the detection of under - luminous clouds with the respect to predictions based on the cr flux at earth would suggest that the local cr density is enhanced with respect to the galactic average density .",
    "this would cast doubts on the assumption that the local crs are produced only by distant sources , and that the cr flux and spectrum measured locally is representative of the typical cr flux and spectrum present throughout the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the diffusion of crs into molecular clouds depends upon the highly uncertain diffusion coefficient .",
    "crs can penetrate clouds if the diffusion coefficient inside the molecular clouds is the same as the average diffusion coefficient in the galaxy , as derived from spallation measurements .",
    "crs are effectively excluded if the diffusion coefficient is suppressed @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that crs at tev energies can diffuse into even the densest parts of molecular clouds . whilst gev energy crs can diffuse into typical galactic molecular clouds @xcite",
    ", they have trouble penetrating the densest parts of particular molecular clouds , such as the gc giant molecular cloud , sagittarius  b2 ( @xcite and references therein ) .      under the assumption that the cr background in the region of longitude range @xmath9 and latitude range @xmath10 is uniform and equal to the locally observed cr flux we calculate the spectral features and the longitudinal and latitudinal profiles of the @xmath0-ray  emission",

    "we note however , that for extended sources ( i.e. , sources whose intrinsic size is larger than the beam size ) , equation ( [ eqn : fluxcloud ] ) shows that the cr flux density is proportional to the distance squared and inversely proportional to the mass . since the mass scales as the distance square , the relative errors exactly cancel . for unresolved sources ( i.e. , sources whose intrinsic size is smaller than the beam size )",

    "in particular , in the energy range between 10 mev and 100 mev bremsstrahlung processes of background and secondary electrons produce a non negligible contribution to the @xmath0-ray  emission , so that the presented method can be applied to the analysis of the @xmath0-ray  emission above 100 mev-1 gev , where moreover the angular resolution of the fermi lat detector is substantially better .",
    "finally unknown cr source(s ) might produce an enhancement of the local cr background .",
    "the cr level in distant regions of the galaxy and the distribution of galactic cr sources are unknown .",
    "@xmath0-rays  emitted when cr protons and nuclei interact with the atomic and molecular gas have been long recognised as a unique probe of the cr flux and spectrum in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "we have here introduced a methodology which aims to provide a test bed for current and future @xmath0-ray  observatories to explore the cosmic ray flux at various positions in our galaxy . in order to investigate the cr spectrum in distant regions of the galaxy",
    "we have here assumed that the cr flux and spectrum measured at the earth is representative of the typical cr flux and spectrum present throughout the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath0-ray  emission arising from such cr spectrum has been calculated in specific regions of the galaxy , using the knowledge on the distribution of the atomic and molecular gas , as given by the lab and nanten surveys , respectively .",
    "the peaks in the longitudinal and latitudinal distributions of the gas correspond to directions in the galaxy , where only one or at most few massive clouds contribute to the total mass .",
    "this can be demonstrated by studying how the gas is distributed along the line of sight distance .",
    "we have then exploited this knowledge of the gas number density point by point to determine the total mass of the gas of some mcs of the galaxy . from the total mass of the atomic and molecular gas",
    "we have calculated the level of the @xmath0-ray  emission in such gas clouds . the predicted @xmath0-ray  emission from such gas clouds",
    "can be compared with observations of present and future @xmath0-ray detectors and provide a test of the cr density in distant locations of the galaxy .",
    "we have , in particular , demonstrated that the new high quality data of nanten and the performance of the fermi lat telescope are sufficient for meaningful probes of cr densities in specific localised regions .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : fluxcloud ] ) shows that the cr flux density is proportional to the distance squared and to the @xmath0-ray  ray flux and inversely proportional to the mass of the mc . the error in the determination of distances ( especially at small distances ; c.f .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ) is as large as 2  kpc .",
    "we note however , that for extended sources ( i.e. , sources whose intrinsic size is larger than the beam size ) the mass scales as the distance square and the relative errors on mass and distance exactly cancel .",
    "moreover , above 100 mev - 1 gev , the competing leptonic processes , bremsstrahlung and ic of background and secondary electrons , produce a negligible contribution to the @xmath0-ray  emission .",
    "the emission from molecular clouds , located far from strong cr sources , is then the footprint of the cr _ sea _ within the cloud and molecular clouds serve then as _ barometers _ of the cr pressure .",
    "the detection of even a single under - luminous cloud with respect to the predictions based on the local cr density would cast severe doubt on the assumption that the level of the observed cr flux is representative of the average cr flux and spectrum in the galaxy .",
    "this conclusion is even reinforced if additional gas , not yet revealed , is present in the cloud . in this regard , by comparing various interstellar gas tracers , egret @xmath0-ray sky maps , hi and co lines but also dust thermal emission , @xcite unveiled clouds of dark gas surrounding the nearby co clouds .",
    "@xcite concluded that the additional mass from dark clouds implies that the cosmic ray densities are overestimated in regions rich in dark clouds .",
    "a detailed analysis of the spectral features of the @xmath0-ray  emission from various regions of the galaxy is also crucial .",
    "in fact , deviations from the standard spectrum are indications of local cr sources .",
    "the regions in the galaxy where the spectral features and/or the normalisation of the @xmath0-ray spectrum can not be explained by interactions of a cr spectrum similar to that measured close to the sun , are of interest to probe the sites of galactic cr injection , such as snrs and pulsars .",
    "the fermi observatory , which detects @xmath0-rays  in the energy range between tens of mevs and hundreds of gevs and which benefits by a large effective area and good angular resolution , is an ideal instrument to perform survey of extended diffuse sources such as molecular clouds in the galaxy .",
    "additionally , future vhe detectors , such as cta , will offer improved sensitivity and angular resolution , close to the angular resolution of the nanten survey , and could investigate the morphology of the @xmath0-ray   emission and compare it to the structures of molecular hydrogen clouds in the galaxy .",
    "future iact telescopes ability to resolve clouds will of course strongly depend upon the instrument sensitivity to detect extended sources . on the other hand , future large field of view experiments , such as hawc , will be able to investigate the level of the cosmic ray background on large portions of the sky @xcite .    finally , we note that we have applied our analysis of the spectral line observations to predict the @xmath0-ray emission in only one distant region .",
    "it serves mostly as a proof - of - concept , to be followed by a more comprehensive study of the entire galaxy .",
    "first of all we would like to thank the anonymous referee for his / her help to improve the manuscript .",
    "the nanten telescope was operated based on a mutual agreement between nagoya university and the carnegie institution of washington .",
