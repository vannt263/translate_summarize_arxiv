    "the discovery of the cosmic acceleration @xcite and the search for the energy @xcite , responsible for this phenomenon have stimulated interest for rather exotic types of matter .",
    "the present letter is devoted to some curious properties of the perfect fluid often called `` string gas '' or `` gas of strings '' .",
    "the equation of state for this gas is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the pressure and @xmath3 is the energy density .",
    "one can say that the string gas can be classified as a kind of perfect fluid , which has a rather natural geometrical interpretation .",
    "indeed , the presence of this matter in the universe is equivalent to the existence of the spatial curvature .",
    "we shall dwell on this point in the second section of the letter . here",
    "we would like to add that between other `` geometrical '' species of matter one can mention the cosmological constant with the equation of state @xmath4 and the stiff matter with the equation of state @xmath5 , whose presence is equivalent to the presence of some anisotropy in the spatially homogeneous universe @xcite .    as is well known the condition of the accelerated expansion of the universe is @xmath6 .",
    "then the so called strong energy dominance condition @xmath7 arises rather often in different contests .",
    "thus , the study of properties of such a `` boundary '' case as a gas with the equation of state ( [ eq - of - state ] ) is of certain interest .",
    "the structure of our letter is the following : in the second section we consider the friedmann universes and show how the presence of the string gas can change the observable curvature of the universe ; the third section is devoted to study the solutions of the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations in the presence of the string gas ; the fourth section is devoted to the motion of point - like objects around the spherically symmetric object surrounded by the string gas ( rotation curves ) ; the last section contains some concluding remarks .",
    "let us consider the friedmann universe filled with some mixture of perfect fluids with equations of state @xmath8 .",
    "we suppose that one of these fluids is the string gas .",
    "the metric is as usual @xmath9 where @xmath10 or @xmath11 for open , flat and closed universes respectively .",
    "the first friedmann equation is @xmath12 it is obvious that for the case string gas equation of state the corresponding term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fried1 ] ) behaves like @xmath13 i.e. it has the behaviour coinciding with that of the curvature term @xmath14 and can in some sense mimic it . indeed , let us consider a simple example : let us consider consider a closed friedmann universe , containing some amount of the string gas . shifting the string gas energy density from the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fried1 ] ) to its left - hand side we obtain @xmath15 where @xmath3 is the total energy density of all perfect fluids , excluding the string gas . if @xmath16 then the equation ( [ fried2 ] ) is undistinguishable from the friedmann equation for the flat friedmann universe in the absence of the string gas . if @xmath17 the situation is even more curious - after the suitable rescaling of the cosmological radius @xmath18 ( namely , intoducing @xmath19 ) we can come to the friedmann equation for an open universe .",
    "thus , the presence of the string gas can change the observable spatial topology of a universe .",
    "after the discovery of cosmic acceleration the study of such a classical topic as a spherically symmetric solutions of the einstein equaitons , namely - the study of the tolman - oppenheimer - volokoff equation have acquired a new impact .",
    "the search for such solutions in a spacetime filled with some kind of dark energy revealed a new and interesing geometries .",
    "here we consider the spherically symmetric static star - like object immersed into a universe , filled with the string gas .",
    "we shall look for a static spherically symmetric metric of the form : @xmath20 the time - time radius - radius components of the einstein equations are @xmath21 @xmath22 the energy - momentum conservation equation is @xmath23 solving eq .",
    "( [ einstein0 ] ) with the boundary condition @xmath24 gives @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath27    equations ( [ einsteinr])([mu ] ) give rise to the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations @xcite @xmath28 substituting instead of the pressure @xmath2 the energy density taken from eq .",
    "( [ eq - of - state ] ) we come to the following equation @xmath29 thus , we shall study the system of two equations ( [ masstov ] ) and ( [ tov1 ] ) for two variables @xmath3 and @xmath30 . similar analysis for the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations in the presence of the chaplygin gas and the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite",
    "was done in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that at the center of the universe there is a massive spherically symmetric object `` star '' with the radius @xmath31 and the mass @xmath32 .",
    "the mass and the radius satisfy the `` absence of horizon '' relation @xmath33 the star is immersed in the string gas , whose energy density at the boundary of the star is @xmath34 .",
    "we shall consider the situation when this initial energy density of the string gas is much less than the average density of the star , i.e. @xmath35 in this case the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tov1 ] ) is positive and the energy density @xmath3 is growing with the radius @xmath36 .",
    "that means that the mass @xmath30 is growing faster than @xmath37 , the factor @xmath38 is diminishing and at some value @xmath39 this factor disappear : @xmath40 at the same time the factor @xmath41 in the numerator of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tov1 ] ) is also decreasing . indeed , using the equation ( [ masstov ] ) we see that @xmath42 the point is that the expressions @xmath38 and @xmath41 vanish at the same value of the radius @xmath39 . to prove this statement",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ tov1 ] ) in the following form @xmath43 thus , if the factor @xmath38 tends to zero while @xmath44 is finite the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tov2 ] ) is regular and its right - hand side is singular .",
    "viceversa , if @xmath44 tends to zero while @xmath38 is finite the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tov2 ] ) is singular and its right - hand side is regular . in both cases we come to a contradiction",
    "thus , the only regime possible is that , when both factors disappear at the same value of @xmath45 .",
    "the value of the energy density @xmath3 at this value of radius is @xmath46    we shall call the surface with @xmath45 `` equator '' because after the crossing of this surface the radial variable begin decreasing ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . to describe the crossing of the equator it is convenient to introduce the trigonometric coordinate @xmath47 now the tov equations look like @xmath48 @xmath49 in the neighbourhood of the equator , where @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a small angle , the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ tov - trig ] ) and ( [ mass - trig ] ) is @xmath52 where @xmath53 ia an arbitrary non - negative constant and @xmath54 thus , we see that the regime of the equator crossing is defined by two constants @xmath39 and @xmath53 , which correspond to two initial conditions : @xmath34 and @xmath32",
    ".    now we would like to study what happens with the geometry of the universe after the crossing of the equator .",
    "it is convenient for this purpose to introduce a new variable @xmath55 in terms of this variable the tov equations can be rewritten as @xmath56 @xmath57 from the formula ( [ equat1 ] ) it follows that after the crossing of the equator the energy density is growing .",
    "that means that the factor @xmath58 in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ tov - y ] ) is decreasing becoming negative .",
    "a simple calculation shows that @xmath59 is equal to @xmath60 at the equator crossing .",
    "thus , this factor is growing .",
    "the change of the behaviour of one of two quantities , @xmath3 or @xmath58 , is possible only if one of them or the factor @xmath61 would have passed through the zero value , but it is impossible , while @xmath3 is growing and @xmath3 or @xmath58 is decreasing , being negative .",
    "that means that during the evolution in terms of change of the parameter @xmath62 in the interval @xmath63 the factors @xmath61 and @xmath58 conserve their signs .",
    "note , that the value @xmath64 corresponds to the opposite pole of our spheroidal manifold , i.e. to the point where @xmath65 .    in principle",
    ", one can imagine the situation , when the manifold can not be continued until the pole @xmath66 , because of the singularity arising at some finite value of @xmath67 .",
    "such a singularity could arise if the the energy density is growing as @xmath68 then , the mass behaves as @xmath69 , i.e. it is much smaller than @xmath3 . in this case",
    "( [ tov - y ] ) tells that @xmath70 in its left - hand side is proportional to @xmath71 in its righ - hand side .",
    "it implies the equality @xmath72 which , in turn implies the logaritmic divergence of the mass , which excludes the equality between the left - hand side and the right - hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ tov - y ] ) .",
    "now , after having proved the impossibility of existence of the singularity at @xmath73 , we should study different possible regimes of approaching to the pole @xmath74 .",
    "first , let us suppose that when @xmath75 the energy density of gas @xmath3 tends to some finite value : @xmath76 where , @xmath77 and @xmath78 some positive constants .",
    "in this case from eq .",
    "( [ mass - y ] ) follows that @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a negative constant . substituting expressions ( [ pole ] ) and ( [ mass - pole ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ tov - y ] ) we obtain the following relation : @xmath81 which can be satisfied at @xmath82 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 describes a possible regime of approximation to the pole @xmath65 , this regime is characterized by two constants : @xmath84 and @xmath85 . trying to consider the regime when @xmath86 , we come to the relation @xmath87 , which obviously can not be satisfied",
    ".    now , let us consider a regime when @xmath3 tends to infinity .",
    "the analysis similar to one done above shows that such regime can exist if the energy density of the string gas diverges linearly @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a positive constant , while the mass tends to some negative value @xmath90 .",
    "thus , we have find two families of geometries .",
    "one of them has a finite scalar curvature at the south pole of the spheroidal manifold , while the second family characterized by the divergent energy density and , hence , by the divergent scalar curvature .",
    "both the families have a standard schwarzschild - like singularity at the south pole but with the negative value of the mass parameter .",
    "it is impossible to establish analytically what is the relation between these two families and the parameters @xmath39 and @xmath53 , describing the equator crossing .",
    "however , such a relation can be studied numerically .",
    "we have studied the numerical solution of the couple of differential equations ( [ tov - y ] ) and ( [ mass - y ] ) and have found that for all the positive values of the radius of equator @xmath39 and for all the positive values of the parameter @xmath53 the second regime , whose asymptotic behavior is given by eq .",
    "( [ log ] ) is realized .",
    "thus , only the second geometry with the energy density and scalar curvature diverging at the south pole does exist .",
    "let us consider now the rotation curves around spherical symmetric object surrounded by the string gas .",
    "the dependence of the velocity of rotating test mass around the spherically symmetric object in the presence of the string gas is given as usual by the formula @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the newton constant and @xmath93 is the solution of equations ( [ masstov ] ) and ( [ tov1 ] ) .",
    "we integrate numerically these equations with some initial conditions at the boundary @xmath94 of the spherically symmetric object .",
    "the initial conditions satisfy the relations ( [ hor ] ) and ( [ initial ] ) .",
    "the numerical calculations in the vicinity of the spherically symmetric object shows that the rotation curve in the presence of the string gas is rather different from one in its absence .",
    "the velocity is decreasing very slowly and after achieving some minimum value begin growing .",
    "however , this growing begins in the region where the approximation of the unique spherically symmetric object in the universe is already invalid and it is necessary to take into account the presence of other objects . in the figure the typical behaviour of the rotation curves in the presence and in the absence of the string gas is shown .     on the distance from the center of the spherical object .",
    "the red dashed line gives the rotation curve in the presence of the string gas , the blue line gives the rotation curve in its absence .",
    "the radius of the speherical object is chosen equal to 1 .",
    "its mass is equal to 0.01 .",
    "the density of the string gas at the surface of the spherical object is chosen equal to 0.002 . ]    in principle one should also take into account the influence of the archimedean force acting on the rotating object , which in our case modifies the formula ( [ velocity ] ) as follows : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the density of the rotating object , which should much higher than the density of the string gas in the vicinity of the spherical object .",
    "the numerical calculations , however , show that the influence of the archimedean term in the right - hand side eq .",
    "( [ velocity1 ] ) is negligibly small .",
    "we have studied one of the simplest perfect fluids - the string gas with the equation of state ( [ eq - of - state ] ) and have shown that unexpectingly it has rather interesting properties . in a friedmann universe its presence can change the observable topology of the space , in the spherically symmetric spacetimes it produces rather bizzare geometries and in a way its influence on the rotation curves mimics the dark matter effects .",
