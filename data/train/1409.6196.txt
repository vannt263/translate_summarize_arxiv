    "donor - acceptor compounds have recently attracted considerable attention due to their application in the field of organic electronics @xcite .",
    "a description of donor - acceptor complexes from first principles is desirable to achieve an atomistic understanding of charge - transfer processes and their impact on electronic properties .",
    "however , charge transfer remains a major challenge for presently available first principles techniques @xcite .    in the weak - coupling limit ( i.e. ,",
    "when the wave - function overlap between the donor and the acceptor becomes negligible ) , the lowest charge - transfer energy ( @xmath3 ) is determined by the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the acceptor .",
    "the homo and lumo energies are equal to the negative of the ionization potential ( ip ) and the electron affinity ( ea ) . in exact density functional theory ( dft )",
    "these values are given by the highest occupied kohn - sham ( ks ) levels of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 electron systems .",
    "for approximate dft , the slater - janak transition states,@xcite i.e. the ks levels of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 electron systems , provide an accurate estimate of the homo and lumo energies . at large separation between donor and acceptor",
    ", charge transfer may occur in the ground state if the homo of the donor lies energetically above the lumo of the acceptor or as a neutral charge transfer excitation otherwise .",
    "therefore , first principles methods that do not accurately capture orbital energies of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 electron systems , may provide a qualitatively wrong description of charge transfer and , subsequently , ground - state properties such as the charge density .",
    "an alternative to dft for the description of the homo and lumo ( or ip and ea ) energies is many - body perturbation theory .",
    "below we apply many - body green s function theory to describe charge transfer .",
    "the single - particle green s function provides a rigorous way to determine electronic excitations in molecules and solids and gives access to the total energy and therefore the ground - state properties of a system . in this context ,",
    "hedin s @xmath0 approximation @xcite for the single - particle green s function has become a well established framework for the calculation of ip and ea , also referred to as quasiparticle excitations @xcite .",
    "however , in perturbative @xmath0 calculations ( @xmath1 ) @xcite only the quasiparticle energies are evaluated at the @xmath0 level , whereas the ground - state density is left unchanged and remains at the unperturbed level , typically dft .",
    "if spurious charge transfer has occurred at the dft stage due to an inherent deficiency of the chosen exchange - correlation ( xc ) functional , @xmath1 can not rectify this charge transfer , despite the fact that @xmath1 may yield a qualitatively correct homo - lumo alignment in donor - acceptor systems .    in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate that the self - consistent @xmath0 approach ( sc-@xmath0 )  in which the green s function is obtained from the iterative solution of the dyson equation ",
    "provides a suitable first principles framework for the description of donor - acceptor systems . compared to @xmath1",
    ", the main advantages of the sc-@xmath0 method are the consistent description of ground and excited states and its independence of the initial reference ground state @xcite .",
    "for a set of prototypical donor - acceptor complexes , we assess the performance of dft hybrid exchange - correlation functionals , @xmath1 , and sc-@xmath0 based on the following criteria : ( i ) accuracy of the quasiparticle spectrum and ( ii ) charge transfer .",
    "we show that sc-@xmath0 yields a qualitatively correct homo - lumo alignment .",
    "moreover , it correctly predicts that the chosen donor - acceptor complexes do not exhibit any charge transfer at large donor - acceptor distances , as expected from reference experimental data and high - level quantum - chemical calculations .",

    "[ eq : ect ] reduces to @xmath31 which now only depends on the relative energy position between the ip of the neutral donor and the ea of the neutral acceptor .",

    "we first address the ground - state properties of the ttf - tcne dimer . for a quantitative assessment of the charge transfer between the donor and acceptor",
    ", we evaluated the dipole moment of the ttf - tcne dimer for several values of the intermolecular distance ( right panel of fig .",

    "since charge transfer should not take place in the weak - coupling limit , the component of the dipole moment parallel to the ttf - tcne axis is expected to vanish . for pbe calculations and pbe - based hybrid functionals with @xmath35 , however , we observe a linear divergence of the dipole moment for increasing distance between the monomers .",
    "the diverging dipole at large intermolecular separation is a clear indication that charge is transferred from the donor to the acceptor .",
    "the charge transfered between ttf and tcne  estimated from the ratio between the dipole moment and the intermolecular distance ( left panel of fig .",

    "this is most likely due to the pauli principle , that requires that the molecular states of each molecule also have to be orthogonal to the states of the other molecule .",
    "the spurious charge transfer that pbe and hybrid functionals with a low fraction of exact exchange predict for donor - acceptor systems is related to the _ deviation from straight line error _",

    "the total energy does not exhibit a linear behavior for fractional electron numbers , as expected for the exact xc functional .",

    "the corresponding eigenvalue of the molecule at integer occupation is then obtained in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "if the total energy is a linear function of @xmath29 , the ks eigenvalue ( i.e. , the derivative of the total energy ) is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "conversely , if the xc functional suffers from dsle , the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied ks levels will exhibit an @xmath29 dependence , that will be stronger for larger deviations from linearity . for xc functionals that produce a convex deviation from the straight line ,",
    "the highest occupied ks level is too low in energy and the lowest unoccupied ks level too high . for a concave deviation , such as in pbe ,",
    "the highest occupied ks level is too high and the lowest unoccupied ks level too low .",
    "a concave deviation could thus result in spurious charge transfer @xcite .",

    "<S> we investigate charge transfer in prototypical molecular donor - acceptor compounds using hybrid density functional theory ( dft ) and the @xmath0 approximation at the perturbative level ( @xmath1 ) and at full self - consistency ( sc-@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the systems considered here , no charge transfer should be expected at large intermolecular separation according to photoemission experiment and accurate quantum - chemistry calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the capability of hybrid exchange - correlation functionals of reproducing this feature depends critically on the fraction of exact exchange @xmath2 , as for small values of @xmath2 spurious fractional charge transfer is observed between the donor and the acceptor . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 based on hybrid dft yields the correct alignment of the frontier orbitals for all values of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath1 has no capacity to alter the ground - state properties of the system , because of its perturbative nature . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density in donor - acceptor compounds thus remains incorrect for small @xmath2 values . in sc-@xmath0 , where the green s function is obtained from the iterative solution of the dyson equation , </S>",
    "<S> the electron density is updated and reflects the correct description of the level alignment at the @xmath0 level , demonstrating the importance of self - consistent many - body approaches for the description of ground- and excited - state properties in donor - acceptor systems . </S>"
