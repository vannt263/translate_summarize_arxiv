    "this paper is devoted to studies of the following generalized , doubly parabolic ( @xmath0 ) keller - segel - type system with a logistic term ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2 on @xmath3 , _",
    "i.e. _ the one dimensional periodic torus , where @xmath4 ( for basic notation and definitions , see section [ ssub : prel ] )",
    ". a similar model has been mentioned by biler & wu , see @xcite , section 5 . in -",
    "we take parameters @xmath5 and nonnegative initial data @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    ". we will refer to - with @xmath8 as to the parabolic - elliptic system and with @xmath0 as to the doubly parabolic one . in order to clarify the terminology ,",
    "let us simply define the case @xmath9 as subcritical , @xmath10 as critical and @xmath11 as supercritical .",
    "the system - with @xmath12 and @xmath10 , @xmath13 is the @xmath14 simplification of the one considered by us in @xcite , _",
    "@xmath15        our interest in the system - stems from the mathematical studies of chemotaxis initiated by keller & segel in @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis is a chemically prompted motion of cells with density @xmath16 towards increasing concentrations of a chemical substance with density @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , in the case of the slime mold _ dictyostelium discoideum _ , the signal is produced by the cells themselves and cell populations might form aggregates in finite time .",
    "chemotaxis also takes place in certain bacterial populations , such as of _ escherichia coli _ and _ salmonella typhimurium _ , and it results in their arrangement into a variety of spatial patterns . during embryogenesis , chemotaxis plays a role in angiogenesis , pigmentation patterning and neuronal development .",
    "it is also important in cancerogenesis , since certain tumors force the host organism to link them with its blood system via chemical signals .",
    "specifically , in presence of the logistic term , our model is of particular importance in view of its relationship with the three - component urokinase plasminogen invasion model ( see hillen , painter & winkler @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , let us observe that the cell kinetics model m@xmath18 in hillen & painter @xcite , that describes a bacterial pattern formation or cell movement and growth during angiogenesis , reads @xmath19 system - in one dimension is especially close to our system - , since it is given by choosing @xmath20 in - with @xmath21 .",
    "the parabolic - elliptic ( @xmath8 ) version of the system - is close to astrophysical models of a gravitational collapse .",
    "it is very similar in spirit to the zeldovich approximation @xcite used in cosmology to study the formation of large - scale structures in the primordial universe , see also ascasibar , granero - belinchn & moreno @xcite .",
    "it is also connected with the chandrasekhar equation for the gravitational equilibrium of polytropic stars , statistical mechanics and the debye system for electrolytes , see biler & nadzieja @xcite . a more detailed presentation of some results on systems of type - and - follows in section [ s9 ] .",
    "the importance of the fractional diffusion generalization - of - is twofold .",
    "primarily , there is a serious mathematical interest involved . to explain this point ,",
    "let us recall that chemotaxis systems model two opposite phenomena : one is diffusion of cells due to their random movements , the other is their tropism toward higher concentrations of a chemical that may result in their aggregations .",
    "hence it is mathematically interesting to establish the minimal strength of diffusion that overweights the chemotactic forces , hence giving , roughly speaking , the global existence of regular solutions or , equivalently , to study the maximal strength of diffusion that does not prevent blowup .",
    "let us recall that for the parabolic - elliptic in two space dimensions the standard diffusion @xmath22 is critical ; moreover the exact initial mass @xmath23 that divides the regimes of global existence and of blowup has been computed , compare for instance bournavas & calvez @xcite and its references .",
    "let us remark here that the blowup phenomenon together with the mass threshold was shown by jger & luckhaus @xcite and nagai @xcite .    for the doubly parabolic case in two space dimensions the situation is analogous , but here the available results are much later and less complete , see mizoguchi @xcite and references therein .",
    "in this context one may argue that the doubly parabolic case is substantially more difficult than the parabolic - elliptic one .",
    "we refer again to section [ s9 ] for more detailed overview of the known results .    in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "the standard diffusion is strong enough to give the global existence ; on the other hand , for @xmath24 it is too weak . in this context",
    "it is mathematically interesting to find , for a fixed space dimension @xmath25 , a _",
    "critical _ diffusive operator that sits on the borderline of the blowup and global - in - time regimes .",
    "there are at least two approaches to this problem , both justified from the point of view of applications .",
    "one is to consider the semilinear diffusion @xmath26 , see for instance bedrossian , rodriguez & bertozzi @xcite , blanchet , carrillo & laurenot @xcite , cielak & stinner @xcite , burczak , cielak & morales - rodrigo @xcite , cielak & laurenot @xcite ad tao & winkler @xcite .",
    "another one is to replace the standard diffusion with the fractional one .",
    "in such a case there is a strong evidence that the half - laplacian @xmath4 is especially worth studying ; for more on this , see subsection [ ssec : priorf ] .",
    "we focus on the latter approach and one dimension .",
    "let us mention here that the logistic term generally helps the global existence , see tello & winkler @xcite , winkler @xcite , burczak & granero - belinchn @xcite .",
    "however , in view of our interest in large - time behavior of solutions to - , we include the logistic term in our considerations here mainly due to the context in which it appears in @xcite , namely the spatio - temporal chaos .",
    "apart from the outlined mathematical interest in fractional diffusion systems , it is also believed that they can be useful for modelling certain feeding strategies . for studies on microzooplancton , compare klafter , lewandowsky & white @xcite and bartumeus , peters , pueyo , marras & catalan @xcite ;",
    "on amoebas  lewandowsky , white & schuster @xcite , flying ants  shlesinger & klafter @xcite , fruit flies ",
    "cole @xcite , and jackals  atkinson , rhodes , macdonald & anderson @xcite .    of course",
    "our system - is merely motivated by the applications in biology and not directly applicable , since it concerns one space dimensions and no boundary .",
    "nevertheless , let us remark here that most of the analysis in this paper can be carried out in the case where the domain is the real line .",
    "in particular , theorems [ localexistence ] , [ continuation ] , [ globalwiener ] , [ globalpp1 ] , [ globalpp1abs ] , [ smoothingeffect ] and also part of theorem [ globalpp2 ] ( when @xmath27 ) can be adapted to the real line in a straightforward way .      in section [ s9 ]",
    "we present in more details the known results on keller - segel - type systems .",
    "section [ ssub : prel ] introduces basic notation , function spaces and our notion of solution .",
    "next , we provide precise statements of our main results as well as some additional remarks in section [ s1 ] .",
    "the following sections contain proofs of our statements .",
    "in particular , in section [ s2 ] we prove local existence of solutions to - , while in section [ s2b ] we show continuation criteria .",
    "next , in sections [ s10 ] and [ s3 ] , we study the global - in - time existence . more precisely , we prove global existence of regular solutions in the hypoviscous case @xmath28 , provided an explicit smallness condition for initial data holds and @xmath29 .",
    "this result holds for @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , for arbitrary smooth initial data , we show global existence of    * weak solutions in the subcritical case @xmath27 for @xmath1 and in both critical and subcritical case @xmath31 for @xmath32 , * strong solutions in the subcritical case @xmath27 with either @xmath33 and @xmath1 or with @xmath34 and @xmath32 .",
    "section [ pf : abs ] provides results on the absorbing set in the case @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "in section [ s5 ] we study the smoothing properties of the systems - , including an instantaneous gain of analyticity of the solution to - .    in sections",
    "[ s6 ] and [ s8 ] we study existence of an attractor and the dynamical properties of - ( for parameters @xmath37 large enough ) .",
    "the solution in a neighborhood of this attractor develops a number of _ peaks _ that eventually merge with each other while other peaks emerge , see figure [ evolution ] .",
    "we are able to bound from above the number of these peaks analytically .    .",
    "]    the aforementioned results are presented in figure [ scheme ] .    .",
    "]    finally , in section [ s7 ] , we perform a numerical study of - and provide numerical evidence of the finite time blow up in the case @xmath38 , @xmath39 .      to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "there are not many regularity results for the doubly parabolic fractional keller - segel system .",
    "hence the generalization of the parabolic - elliptic global existence results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to the system - , even with @xmath40 ( the standard chemotactic term ) and @xmath30 , appears to be new . in particular , we prove global existence and boundedness of classical solutions with no restriction on size of initial data in the subcritical regime @xmath9 and with a restriction in the critical case @xmath10 .",
    "the restriction of the latter result is explicit and of the same order as the other parameters present in the system . in its proof",
    "we use the wiener s algebra approach , which seems to be new in the keller - segel context .",
    "nevertheless , we must admit that our smallness condition is quite stringent in the sense that it affects the entire wiener s algebra norm ( as opposed to merely the initial mass , for instance ) .",
    "the dynamical properties of the system are only known when @xmath41 , as far as we know . moreover ,",
    "the bound on the number of peaks seems new even in the classical @xmath41 case .",
    "let us now present some literature concerning the keller - segel - type systems , in addition to that mentioned in subsection [ ssec : mot ] .",
    "there is a huge literature on the mathematical study of - and its parabolic - elliptic counterpart ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "consequently , the list below is far from being exhaustive .",
    "the global existence of solutions to - have been proved ( under certain conditions ) by many authors .",
    "in particular , kozono & sugiyama @xcite showed the global existence and decay of solutions to - , corresponding to small initial data in @xmath42 and with @xmath43 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "biler , guerra & karch @xcite recently proved that for every finite radon measure there exist @xmath44 and a global in time mild solution for - with @xmath45 .",
    "corrias , escobedo & matos @xcite proved that if the initial data @xmath46 is small in @xmath47 there exists a global solution .",
    "this result was recently generalized by cao @xcite .",
    "osaki & yagi @xcite and osaki , tsujikawa , yagi & mimura @xcite obtained the existence of an exponential attractor while hillen & potapov @xcite , using different techniques , also showed the global existence of solutions .",
    "tello & winkler @xcite proved the global existence of weak solutions for the parabolic - elliptic case with logistic term ( @xmath48 @xmath49 for arbitrary @xmath50 ; see also @xcite .",
    "winkler @xcite showed that there exists a global in time solution for the doubly parabolic case with a sufficiently strong logistic parameter @xmath51 .",
    "he also obtained global weak solutions and studied the regularizing properties starting from merely @xmath52 initial data in @xcite . some finite time singularities results for solutions corresponding to certain initial data can be found in @xcite , @xcite by winkler .",
    "a remarkable feature of the model - is its spatio - temporal chaotic behavior . in particular ,",
    "the numerical solutions reported painter & hillen @xcite for the system - develop a number of _ peaks _ that emerge and , eventually , mix with other peaks .",
    "these peaks are maxima of @xmath53 that are very close to a region with their slope bigger than one .",
    "this phenomenon materializes in the numerical study of the system - with different values of @xmath54 ( see figure [ evolution ] for the case @xmath55 and section [ s7 ] . ) . as noted by winkler in @xcite , the dynamical features of keller - segel models in high dimensions , in particular the existence of global attractors and bounded solutions , is an important topic .",
    "the case of a nonlinear diffusion has been studied by several authors .",

    "the case of fractional powers of laplacian instead of local derivatives in the first equation ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) has been addressed by several authors .",
    "in particular , for the parabolic - elliptic case , escudero @xcite proved the boundedness of solutions in the one dimensional case with @xmath27 , while li , rodrigo & zhang @xcite proved finite time singularities by constructing a particular set of initial data showing this behaviour .",

    "they also prove global existence for small data in the case @xmath28 , but here the problem of behavior of solutions emanating from large data remained an open question .",
