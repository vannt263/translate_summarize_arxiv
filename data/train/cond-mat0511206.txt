    "stable coherent structures represent one of the main subjects of interest in the mean - field theory of quantum gases at zerotemperature  @xcite . in quasi - one - dimensional condensates of bosonic atoms , such structures are conventionallyassociated with solitons : dark solitons in the case of repulsive interactions among atoms , and bright solitons in the caseof attractive interactions .",
    "successful experimental generation of dark and bright solitons has been reported inbose - einstein condensates in refs .",
    "@xcite and refs  @xcite , respectively .",
    "considerable progress has alsooccurred in the experimental creation of more sophisticated condensates , in particular , boson - fermion(bf ) mixtures ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the first theoretical studies of such systems have revealed anumber of interesting properties .",
    "one such property is an effective attraction that develops among bosonsdue to the boson - fermion interaction  @xcite which affects the background distribution and the stability properties of thecondensate  @xcite .",
    "very recently , numerical work  @xcite has shown that localized distributions ofcondensed atoms , associated with solitonic trains , can form in a strongly anisotropic trap even when the boson - boson interaction is repulsive . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been suggested that the respective localized states , can be interpreted as a matter wave realization of quantum dots.a boson - fermion mixture can exhibit quite different types of behavior according to the relative ratio of the two components .",
    "the model explored in  @xcite and @xcite addresses a mixture of a relatively small number of fermions embedded in a much larger bosonic component . in this paper",
    ", we consider the opposite situation of a relatively smaller number of bosons embedded in a large fermionic component .",
    "such a large fermion component can become degenerate , and only a small portion of the fermions in the vicinity of the fermi surface participates in the kinetic processes . if the fermions were also spin - polarized , and thus noninteracting , they would represent a linear system .",
    "it turns out however  @xcite , that the presence of bosons , even in a relatively small number , can introduce nonlinearity into the fermion system , thereby significantly changing the properties of the system . in the present paper",
    "we obtain dynamical equations governing the effectively one - dimensional ( 1-d ) bf mixture , show , in particular , the possibility of the appearance of two - component ( bf ) solitons in a strongly anisotropic trap , and describe some of the simplest properties of the solitonic solutions . it is to be noted in this context that two natural limits exists for bosons embedded in a fermi cloud , depending on the relative densities of the fermions and bosons .",
    "one limit is when the boson number dominates the fermion number and is the subject of the analysis in refs .",
    "the other limit is when the fermion number dominates the boson number .",
    "the latter case , as well as a discussion of the differences in the two cases , is considered in the present paper .",

    "in the present paper we consider the case when the transverse dimension of the fermi component , @xmath44 , significantly exceeds the transverse dimension of the bose component , @xmath45 .",
    "the orders of the respective scales can be identified as @xmath46 [ which follows from ( [ tf ] ) ] and @xmath47 , which in dimensionless units corresponds to the transverse oscillator length of the low density bose component .",

    "the use of 1d models , in turn , reveal interesting features of the low - dimensional dynamics , allows one to obtain approximate analytical solutions , and results in dramatical reduction of computational resources in studies of the evolution processes .",
    "since bf mixtures are two - component systems characterized by a variety of scales , a natural question arises : is such a reduction possible in a _ bose - fermi mixture _ ?",
    "this is the question we address in our present study through a generalization of the approach of ref .",

    "we restrict our analysis to fermion numbers large enough to satisfy @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a parameter of the problem",
    ". then we can describe the condition @xmath48 , using the same _ single _ small parameter @xmath54 .",
    "this scaling allows us ( by analogy with ref .",
    "@xcite ) to concentrate on the spatial domain , limited in the transverse direction by some radius @xmath55 , which satisfies the condition @xmath56 .",
    "physically , such scaling is available due to pauli s exclusion principle which forces the fermions to occupy a much larger region relative to the bosons .",
    "specifically , we impose @xmath57 .",
    "the elongation of the fermion trap is expressed through @xmath58 .",
    "the spatial domain of the fermions in the longitudinal direction is defined by the constraint , @xmath59 , which gives @xmath60 , while for the case of bosons when @xmath61 , we have that @xmath62 .",
    "thus we consider the situation in which the boson component is embedded inside the fermion system.subject to the above conditions the tf distribution ( [ tf ] ) can be expanded in the taylor series@xmath63.\\label{1.3a}\\end{aligned}\\]]we look for a solution in the form of the series@xmath64 and@xmath65to justify the above expansion , we introduce a characteristic width @xmath66 of the bosonic excitation in the axial direction so that the boson density may be connected to their total number by means of the estimate : @xmath67 .",
    "this allows us to rewrite the small parameter as @xmath68 . in the case of a localized distribution , @xmath69 , while for the estimates involving plane waves and dark solitons @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the longitudinaldimension of the condensate .",
    "then , for excitations with @xmath69 , from ( [ normal2 ] ) we readily obtain the estimate @xmath72.on the other hand , the scaling we have introduced implies @xmath73 which corroborates the fact that the boson and fermion numbers involved in the dynamics are of the same order ( see also @xcite ) . indeed in momentum space , the fermions in question are located in the vicinity of the fermi surface ; the actual number of fermions , @xmath74 , is much bigger than its time dependent part @xmath75 . in other words @xmath76 is verified .",
    "the natural occurrence of the small parameter @xmath54 in the problem suggests a perturbation treatment in powers of @xmath54 . a regular analysis , however , gives rise to secular terms and , consequently , to an inaccurate description .",

    "in this paper we have considered a boson - fermion mixture , where the number of fermions is much larger than the number of bosons and is confined by a strongly anisotropic trap .",
    "it has been shown that both the boson and fermion systems are described by an effective 1d nonlinear schrdinger equation ( [ b - cf ] ) and thus can display modulational instability and the existence of bright and dark solitons .",

    ", the fermions would tend to propagate with their fermi velocity .",
    "however , the coupling to the bosons that is present in our system forces them to form a slow ( and even static ) solitary excitation following the behavior of the bosons .",
    "a remarkable feature of the result obtained is that the soliton dynamics is governed by a single nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , even though , physically , it describes two separate systems .",
    "the soliton solution of the nls equation can describe either an increase or a decrease in the densities of the two components . in the case of the attractive interaction between the components ,",
    "the solitons may describe simultaneous increase or decrease of the densities of both the components of the mixture . in the case of the repulsive interactions between the components on the other hand",
    ", they can describe an increase of the density in one component and a decrease of the density in the other component .",
    "this is quite an unusual situation : there is only one soliton solution to the nls equation for a given effective nonlinearity , however it describes opposite effects in the two components .",
    "another feature to be mentioned is that due to the finite extension of the condensate in the longitudinal direction , an internal mode is excited .",
    "this excitation results in the effective mass of the bosons , making up the soliton , being twice as large as the real mass , which does not happen in the case of infinite extent of the trap .",
    "we have explicitly shown that the type of the effective interactions can be experimentally manipulated either by just affecting the trap geometry or by means of feshbach resonance ( the latter option being also efficient in the opposite case of relatively small number of fermions  @xcite ) .",
