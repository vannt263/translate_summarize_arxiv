    "a magnetic field connecting a kerr black hole to a disk rotating around it can transfer energy and angular momentum between the black hole and the disk ( @xcite and references therein ) . when the black hole rotates faster than the disk , energy and angular momentum",
    "are extracted from the black hole and transfered to the disk .",
    "if the magnetic field is weak , the energy transfered to the disk by the magnetic connection can be dissipated and radiated away by the disk @xcite .",
    "thus , in the presence of magnetic connection , the rotational energy of the black hole provides an energy source for disk radiation in addition to disk accretion @xcite .",
    "in fact , a disk magnetically coupled to a rapidly rotating kerr black hole can radiate without the need of accretion @xcite .",
    "in such a case , all the power of the disk comes from the rotational energy of the black hole .    due to the lack of knowledge about the topology and distribution of the magnetic field connecting the black hole to the disk , a detailed model of the magnetic connection between a black hole and a disk",
    "does not exist yet , except the simplest and _ ad hoc _ model where the magnetic field is assumed to connect the black hole to the disk close to the inner boundary @xcite , or at a single radius beyond the inner boundary @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider a toy model for the magnetic connection : a single toroidal electric current flows around a kerr black hole in the equatorial plane which is coincident with the plane of a thin keplerian disk rotating around the black hole .",
    "the toroidal current generates a poloidal magnetic field which connects the black hole to the disk . due to the relative rotation between the black hole and the disk and the fact that the horizon of a kerr black hole is a conductor with a finite electric resistivity @xcite and",
    "a plasma disk is a perfect conductor , an electromotive forces ( emf ) is induced which in turn generates a poloidal electric current flowing through the black hole and the disk .",
    "the poloidal current produces a torque and a power on the disk , which makes the disk shine without the need of accretion .",
    "we will calculate the power and the resulting radiation flux of the disk with the assumption that there is no accretion and the configuration is steady and axisymmetric , and compare the results with that of a standard accretion disk .",
    "a similar model has been used by li @xcite to test the efficiency of the blandford - znajek mechanism @xcite . by assuming a toroidal current continuously distributed in a thin keplerian disk , li @xcite has shown that the power of the disk always dominates over the power of the black hole , which confirms the early speculation of blandford and znajek @xcite and the recent arguments of livio , ogilvie , and pringle @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will find that , an electric current flowing around a black hole in the equatorial plane naturally generates a magnetic field connecting the black hole to its disk .",
    "this implies that the existence of magnetic connection between a black hole and a disk is a very natural assumption in view of physics .",
    "essentially the magnetic connection between a black hole and a disk is a variant of the blandford - znajek mechanism .",
    "however , it is simpler and better defined than the blandford - znajek mechanism since a unknown remote load is not required @xcite .",
