    "a common method to calculate the magnetic moment of a sample necessitates its movement through a pick - up coil system inside the magnet of a superconducting quantum intereference device ( squid ) magnetometer .",
    "the obtained response , i.e. the pick - up coil signal as a function of the sample s position on the axis of the pick - up coil system , is fitted using the theoretical response of a magnetic point dipole of moment _ m_. the fitting parameter _ m _ is compared with the system calibration and the sign and value of the sample s magnetic moment is calculated .    the above method for the determination of the magnetic moment can sometimes create serious problems in the measurements of superconducting samples , when these are done in a non - homogeneous field .",
    "this is because most of the analysis methods of the squid s response assume that the magnetic moment of the sample does not change during the measurement .",
    "a superconducting sample though , will follow a minor hysteresis loop during the measurement , if this is done in a non - homogeneous field .",
    "thus , the value of the sample s magnetic moment calculated by the magnetometer s software will not represent the actual moment of the sample at the temperature of the measurement .",
    "such problems , which may create spurious features in the d.c .",
    "magnetization of superconducting materials , have been discussed by several authors in the past .",
    "for example , blunt _",
    "@xcite investigating the superconducting properties of ( tlv@xmath3)sr@xmath0(ca@xmath4y@xmath5)cu@xmath0o@xmath6 suggest , that the paramagnetic moments reported by lee _",
    "_ @xcite are artefacts arising from the movement of the sample in a non - homogeneous field during the measurements .",
    "@xcite show , that the _ m_(_t_,_h _ ) measurement of ybco single crystals at temperatures below the irreversibility temperature is seriously affected by a spatial inhomogeneity of the applied field and braunisch _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who discovered the paramagnetic meissner effect in bi high temperature superconductors , point out the necessity , that the samples do not move during the measurement for reliable results to be produced .    in this paper ,",
    "we present the problem of squid magnetometry for superconducting samples in more detail .",
    "we show how the measured signals can be deformed when a measurement is done in a non - homogeneous field and point out the errors that can occur when the magnetic moment of a superconducting sample is extracted from these deformed signals . as an example we discuss the case of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ru-1212 ) .",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite , that this weakly ferromagnetic superconductor is sensitive to field inhomogeneities , which can create problems to the measurements of its magnetic moment .",
    "we use the bean model to show , that field changes less than 100  @xmath2 t over the scanning length in the squid magnetometer can be enough to create artefacts in the measured magnetization of ru-1212 .",
    "for many of the commercially available magnetometers the measurement requires the motion of the sample through a pick - up coil system .",
    "the coils are wound in a second derivative configuration , where the two outer detection loops , located at a distance _ a _ from the center of the magnetometer s magnet , are wound oppositely to the two central loops located at the center of the magnet . during the measurement at a certain temperature",
    ", the movement of the sample through the pick - up coils induces currents in the detection loops , which , through an inductance _",
    "create magnetic flux in the squid circuit , resulting in an output voltage _ v _ , which depends on the position of the sample _",
    "z_.    it is rather trivial to show , that the magnetic flux @xmath7 through a loop with radius _",
    "r _ created by a point dipole of magnetic moment _",
    "m _ located at a distance _ d _ from the loop on the symmetry axis is :    @xmath8    thus , the response of a pick up coil system like the one described above to the movement of a point dipole on its axis _ z _ will be proportional to :    @xmath9^{3/2}}-\\frac{1}{[(z+a)^{2}+r^{2}]^{3/2}}-\\frac{1}{[(z - a)^{2}+r^{2}]^{3/2}}\\right ) \\label{eq : squid}\\ ] ]    where _ z _ is the position of the sample . in eq .",
    "[ eq : squid ] the two central loops of the pick - up coil system are assumed to be at _ _",
    "z__=0 while the two oppositely wound outer loops at _ _",
    "z__=_a _ and _ _ z__=-_a _ respectively .",
    "in figure  [ fig:1 ] we show the pick - up coil voltage for a point dipole with positive ( middle ) and negative ( bottom ) moment constant over the scaning length .",
    "note that in this case the signal is very well defined with extrema at the position of the central and outer loops .        during the measurement of a sample , signals",
    "similar to those presented in figure  [ fig:1 ] are measured . in this case",
    ", the contributions to the measured signal can have more than one source ( sample , sample holder , rod where the sample holder is mounted e.t.c . ) .",
    "nevertheless , eq .",
    "[ eq : squid ] is used to fit the contribution from the sample and calculate its magnetic moment _ m_.",
    "this is because nearly all analysis methods of the measured _ v_(_z _ ) signal make two significant assumptions for the magnetic moment of the sample ( i ) that it approximates a magnetic dipole moment and ( ii ) that the sign and value of this moment do not change during the measurement .",
    "practically , the above assumptions mean , that the magnetometer s software will be able to fit properly the measured signals which are similar to the well defined signals of figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "if , for any reason , the magnetic moment of the sample does not approximate a magnetic dipole moment or if this moment is changing over the scaning length , then the measured signal will be distorted compared to that of figure  [ fig:1 ] , the produced value of the magnetic moment from the magnetometer s sofware will come from the best possible fitting to this distorted signal and it will probably deviate from the real value of the sample s magnetic moment in the temperature of the measurement .          in order to illustrate the problems that field inhomogeneities can cause to the squid magnetitzation measurements of a superconductor , we will investigate the case of a sample in the meissner state measured in a field , which over the scanning length in the pick - up coil system has the profile shown in figure  [ fig:2]a .",
    "such a profile , which changes sign over the scanning length , can represent the profile of the remanent field in the superconducting magnet @xcite and measurements in set ( positive ) values of the magnetic field of the order of the remanent field will probably retain a profile similar to that of figure  [ fig:2]a .",
    "such field profiles will cause a change of the magnetic moment _ m_(_z _ ) , as shown in figure  [ fig:2]a , thus , the assumption for constant magnetic moment will be violated . in figure",
    "[ fig:2]b we show the response of the pick - up coil system to the magnetic moment _ m_(_z _ ) . for comparison the ideal response for a constant negative moment",
    "is also shown . the most striking mistake that the magnetometer s software will do by fitting the signal due to",
    "the non - constant moment is , that it will produce a positive value for the magnetic moment of the sample although this is a superconductor in the meissner state .",
    "note that if no information about the field profile and the nature of the sample is available , it is sometimes very difficult to notice the artefact from the measured signal .",
    "the signal of figure  [ fig:2]b corresponding to _ m_(_z _ ) looks very similar to the ideal signals of figure  [ fig:1 ] and would probably not warn the user of the squid magnetometer for a possible artefact in the measurement .",
    "a careful inspection of the curve though , shows that the two minima are not located at the position of the outer coils but 0.1 cm closer to _ _ z__=0 ( see figure  [ fig:2]b ) .",
    "thus , very careful analysis of the measured signals is necessary for safe conclusions to be drawn , since sometimes the artefact is hidden in small distortions of the signal ( the crossover points are slightly shifted like in figure  [ fig:2]b or the shape of the scan is not quite right ) and as it was already pointed out by blunt _",
    "@xcite most users of squid magnetometers , and especially the inexperienced ones , will miss this fine detail .    in the case ,",
    "where the field profile is not changing sign , the fitting of the measured signal will give the correct sign for the magnetic moment of the sample .",
    "nevertheless , since , as shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] , the higher the level of the field inhomogeneity , the bigger the distortion of the measured signal compared to that corresponding to _ _",
    "m__=constant , the magnetometer s software will calculate values of the magnetic moment which , although they will have the correct sign , will not represent the actual value of the magnetic moment for the sample .",
    "the weakly ferromagnetic superconductor ru-1212 has recently drawn a lot of attention since it is one of the very few high temperature superconductors , where superconductivity arises in a state , in which magnetic order is already developed .",
    "nevertheless , there is some sceptisism whether ru-1212 is a bulk superconductor , which , among others , arises from the contradicting results on the d.c .",

    "for example ,",
    "in figure  [ fig:4 ] we show a zero field cooled ( z.f.c . ) measurement [ the technique for the cancelation of the remanent fields of the superconducting magnet as well as the earth field for the achievement of a field value close to zero is described in references 5 and 14 ] on a ru-1212 sample showing a peak - like feature below the superconducting transition temperature _ _",
    "t@xmath11__=30  k , as it was determined by resistivity and a.c .",
    "susceptibility measurements @xcite .",
    "a similar feature was also observed in the field cooled ( f.c . ) curve @xcite .",
    "the magnetic moment of the sample for these measurements was determined by the magnetometer s software from the signal _",
    "v_(_z _ ) as described in the previous sections by moving the sample through the pick - up coil system in the superconducting magnet of the squid magnetometer . in the same figure",
    "we show the output voltage of the squid circuit recorded without moving the sample , which is proportional to any changes of the sample s magnetic moment as the temperature is changing .",
    "no peak like feature is observed in this curve leading us to the conclusion , that this feature is an artefact arising from the movement of the sample in an inhomogeneous field during the measurement in the squid magnetometer . in view of the observed sensitivity of the ru-1212 measured magnetization in its superconducting state to field inhomogeneities ,",
    "the contradicting results on the measured magnetization in the superconducting state of ru-1212 could be explained as the result of different field profiles in the superconducting magnet of the squid magnetometer . in the following",
    "we will attempt an estimation of the magnitude of the field inhomogeneity necessary to create artefacts in the measured d.c .",

    "= 30  k ( b ) the same as ( a ) after the measured curve at 30  k has been subtracted from the data.,width=283 ]    for the study of the effect of magnetic field inhomogeneities on the d.c .",
    "magnetization measurements of ru-1212 we will need , first of all , a model to describe the field penetration into the sample .",
    "@xcite have shown , that already from the shape of the ( _ h _ ) curves , information about the applicability of a critical state model can be obtained , since different , characteristic , shapes are expected for different models . in figure  [ fig:5 ]",
    "we show measured hysteresis loops for a ru-1212 sample obtained using a home made a.c .",
    "susceptometer @xcite .",
    "the sample was kept stationary within the pick - up coil system , while the primary field is created by a coil made from normal conducting cu - wire . this way we avoid the problems described above , which are related to the movement of the sample in a non - homogeneous field , as well as uncertainties in the determination of the field arising from the remanent fields or trapped flux in the superconducting magnet of the squid magnetometer .",
    "this is an important point since the range of fields ( less than 200  @xmath2 t ) scanned are within the range of the remanent field of a superconducting magnet . in an attempt to correct for the paramagnetic contribution to the signal from the gd moments",
    "we have subtracted the measured curve at 30  k , the shape of which is very close to a paramagnetic line ( see figure  [ fig:5]a ) , from the other measured curves .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig:5]b .",
    "it is obvious from the shape of our curves , that the bean critical state model is appropriate for the description of these magnetization curves @xcite .",
    "we note , that although the bean critical state model is routinely used to describe the properties of many superconducting systems , careful check of its applicability is necessary .",
    "for example , for ru-1212 a transition from a bean model - like behaviour to a kim model - like behaviour has been observed for field changes above @xmath12 8  gauss @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , as shown above , for fields in the range shown in figures  [ fig:4]-  [ fig:5 ] the bean critical state model can be used .",
    "libbrecht _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have applied the bean model in order to describe the influence of field inhomogeneities on the measured magnetization of ybco films .",
    "they model the temperature dependence of the penetration field by a power law of the type :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the lowest applied field for full flux penetration and @xmath15 is the irreversibility temperature , and present equations to fit their measured _ v_(_z_,_t _ ) signals , assuming a field profile similar to the one shown in figure  [ fig:6 ] , which is described by the formula :        @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the set value of the magnetic field and _ d _ is the maximum field variation .",
    "the factor @xmath18 corresponds to the distance over which the field variation takes place , that is half the scan length ( in our case 3 cm ) .",

    "measurement of figure  [ fig:4 ] for @xmath20 , assuming @xmath2130  k. the result is shown in the inset of figure  [ fig:4 ] . from the fit",
    "we obtain @xmath22 ( see eq .  [ eq:3 ] ) and @xmath23 .    from the value of the parameter _ r _ , the change of the the field _ d _ necessary to create artefacts in the d.c .",
    "magnetization measurements of ru-1212 can be estimated , if the value of @xmath24 is known .",
    "it is known @xcite , that for a hysteresis loop , where the scanned field range is much bigger than @xmath14 , like the ones at 25  k and 20  k in figure  [ fig:5 ] , @xmath25 or @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to the upper and lower magnetization plateau respectively .",
    "thus , from the measured hysteresis curve at 25  k we find @xmath14=7.4  @xmath2 t .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] , with the _",
    "n _ value as determined from the fitting of the _ v_(__z__=0,_t _ ) data , @xmath24 is determined as @xmath24=473  @xmath2 t .    for _ _",
    "t__=20  k we calculate using eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] @xmath14=37  @xmath2 t , which is in very good agreement with the @xmath14=35  @xmath2 t value determined from the measured hysteresis curve at 20  k. for _ _",
    "t__=15  k though , eq .  [ eq:3 ] gives @xmath14=90  @xmath2 t .",
    "thus , the scanned range of fields in figure  [ fig:5 ] is about two times the calculated value of @xmath14 at 15  k. this means @xcite that , if the power law used to calculate @xmath14 at 15  k was correct , the shape of the measured curve should be more flat , similar to those at 25  k and 20  k. we have also used eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] to estimate @xmath14 for _ t _ = 10  k and 5  k and calculated @xmath29 at characteristic points of the hysteresis loop using table 12.2 in reference [ 12 ] .",
    "deviations of the calculated values from the measured ones were observed in both cases . from this analysis",
    "we conclude that the power law of eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] is valid only close to _ t@xmath11 _ ( 15  k@xmath30__t__@xmath3030  k ) .",
    "indeed , deviations of the fitting curve from the measured _ v_(__z__=0,_t _ ) data were observed below 15  k.    with the calculated value of @xmath24 it is trivial to show , that the field change over the scanning length which caused the artefact shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] was @xmath3170  @xmath2 t .",
    "thus , field inhomogeneities less than 100  @xmath2 t over the scaning length in the squid magnetometer are enough to create artefacts in the measurements of ru-1212 .",
    "this is already expected from figure  [ fig:5 ] , since the width of the hysteresis loops is less than 100  @xmath2 t .",
    "we note , that field changes of the order of 100  @xmath2 t , or even bigger , are not impossible for the remanent field of a superconducting magnet @xcite and we expect , that measurements with set values of the magnetic field in the order of the remanent field , typical in the search for a meissner state for ru-1212 , will not affect these changes .",
    "it is important to point out that the critical parameter which can create problems in the measurements of a superconducting sample is not the set value of the magnetic field but the absolute change of the field over the scan length . for a measurement in a set field of 250  @xmath2 t an inhomogeneity of 70",
    "@xmath2 t represents a field change of 28% over the scan length .",
    "nevertheless , this inhomogeneity will have the same effect in the measured properties of a superconducting sample even if the measurement is done in a set field of 1  t , where it represents a field change of only 0.007% , which is much smaller than the field homogeneity claimed for the magnets of many of the commercially available magnetometers by their manufacturers .",
    "for ru-1212 though , in high fields , a possible artefact in the signal related to the superconductivity of this compound will probably be hidden by the contribution from the gd paramagnetic moments .",
    "it should not be assumed that artefacts in the d.c .",
    "magnetization measurements of ru-1212 will always cause peak like features similar to those shown in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the specific characteristics of a possible artefact in a _ m_(_t _ ) measurement will depend on the characteristics of the field profile in which the measurement was done .",
    "an example for this is shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "the first measurement of this ru-1212 sample had shown a peak like feature similar to those presented in figure  [ fig:4 ] . nevertheless , after the magnet was cycled to high fields , a cycle very likely to have changed the field profile compared to that of the first measurement @xcite , a reversed peak was observed in the superconducting state of the sample , realised as a decrease of the magnetization just below _",
    "t@xmath11 _ followed by an increase of the magnetization at lower temperatures .",
    "we could assume , that the reversed peak of figure  [ fig:7 ] is the result of a field profile , which is reversed compared to that of figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "this is in accordance with an observation made by mcelfresh _",
    "_ in reference [ 6 ] , where ( measured ) symmetric field profiles with respect to a set value of the magnetic field created artefacts in the measured magnetic moment , which had the form of features reversed with respect to each other .",
    "our assumption is additionally supported by the measurement with a smaller scan length of 3  cm , where we found that the measured magnetic moment in the normal state of the sample is now higher compared to the measurement with the 6  cm scan length .",
    "this indicates , that the average field for the measurement with the 3  cm scan length was higher than that for the measurement with the 6  cm scan length .",
    "thus , the magnetic field for the measurements of figure  [ fig:7 ] can be assumed higher closer to the center of the magnet compared to its values close to the end points of the scan length .",
    "we note that many of the published d.c .",
    "magnetization data on ru-1212 present features which seem to be reversed with respect to each other .",
    "for example the f.c .",
    "curves in reference [ 13 ] ( we concentrate our attention to the field cooled curves because this is where someone would look for the meissner effect ) are similar to those of figure  [ fig:7 ] and present features reversed with respect to the curves presented in reference [ 14 ] , which are similar to the curve in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",
    "also the f.c .",
    "curve of klamut _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , with an increase of the magnetization just below _",
    "t@xmath11 _ , followed by a plateau at low temperatures is also reminiscent of a `` reversed '' effect compared to the f.c .",
    "curves published by bernhard _",
    "@xcite , which show a decrease of the magnetization just below _",
    "t@xmath11 _ and a plateau at low temperatures .    in an attempt to eliminate the problems described above , small scan lengths are often used , in order to measure in the region of the magnet characterised by maximum uniformity .",
    "this tactic though , as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] , does not always have the desired results .",
    "the smaller scan length in figure  [ fig:7 ] reduced the magnitude of the measured magnetic moment in the superconducting state of the sample but it did not eliminate the artefact .",
    "it should also be kept in mind , that small scan lengths extract a smaller proportion of the _ v_(_z _ ) signal and can easier lead to mistakes since the centering of the sample relative to the gradiometer is now more critical . in principal ,",
    "small scan lengths tend to degrade significantly the quality of the measured signal and in such cases an average of several scans is required to improve the statistics of the data .",
    "in summary , the quality of squid d.c . magnetization measurements on superconducting samples can drastically be affected if the measurements are done in an inhomogeneous field .",
    "it is possible that assymetric _ v_(_z _ )",
    "signals will warn the user of a squid magnetometer about possible problems .",
    "nevertheless , in some cases the deformation of these signals is rather small and it will probably not be noticed .    the sample s properties in combination with the level of field inhomogeneities will determine whether artefacts will appear in a d.c .",
    "magnetization measurement , the specific characteristics of which in a _ m_(_t _ ) curve will depend on the specific field profile during the measurement .",
    "however , in some cases the level of field changes over the scan length required to create problems in a measurement is smaller than the claimed homogeneity for the magnets of many of the commercially available magnetometers .",
    "the reduction of the scan length does not guarantee elimination of possible artefacts .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that the quality of the measured signal degrades significantly for short scan lengths .    for the above reasons the validity of the data has to be carefully checked .",
    "the recording of the squid circuit s output voltage without moving the sample can give very useful information about what type of features are expected in the measurements of a superconducting sample .",
    "this is probably the most reliable test for the validity of the data since other tests , like checking the reproducibility of the data after the magnet is cycled to high magnetic fields ( see figure  [ fig:7 ] ) , can lead to systematic errors if the magnetic field profile is reproduced .",
    "even a controllable quench of the magnet , an option available with the most modern magnetometers , in order to eliminate effects related with the trapped flux in it can not guarantee high quality measurements .",
    "the increase of the current on the leads , after quenching , for the achievement of the desired field value , can cause , through the resulting field change , flux trapping effects , which will again affect the field homogeneity over the scanning length . monitoring the squid circuit s output voltage independently of course requires that the magnetometer offers such an option .    testing the validity of the data is a crucial point since in some cases experimental artefacts",
    "can be described by impressive theories .",
    "for example , we have shown @xcite that the peak like features observed for ru-1212 could be interpreted as an indication for the existence of the paramagnetic meissner effect for this compound . by careful evaluation of the data",
    "though , we showed that this is not correct @xcite .",
    "here we have shown that the bean critical state model can be used for the description of the field penetration in ru-1212 in small magnetic fields .",
    "we have used this model to show that field changes less than 100  @xmath2 t over the scanning length in the squid magnetometer are sufficient to create artefacts in the measured properties of this compound .",
    "thus , careful evaluation of the data on this compound is always necessary .",
    "the observed sensitivity of the ru-1212 measured magnetization in its superconducting state to the shape of the measuring field profile could serve as an explanation for the contradicting results on the magnetization of this compound in its superconducting state .",
