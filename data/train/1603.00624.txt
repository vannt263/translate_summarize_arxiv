    "the transition from elastic to macroscopic plastic deformation in metals is a discrete process mediated by intermittent dislocation activity .",
    "historically , such discrete plastic activity was seen in bulk metallic systems by beeker and orowan  @xcite and later by tinder and co - workers  @xcite who used a torsion device , with ultra - high strain resolution , to show that plasticity well below yield was characterized by discrete plastic events separated by regions of near perfect elasticity .",

    "one interesting aspect of the above phenomena is that as the size of the plastically deforming region reduces the stress scale at which the discrete plasticity occurs increases .",

    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "despite the possibility of a change - of - mechanism approach , it has long been recognised that with decreasing sample size , the overall evolution of deformation becomes increasingly stochastic with particular realizations of nominally similar deforming volumes exhibiting a range of responses .",
    "indeed , this aspect has been used to explain the size effect in nano - indentation  @xcite , where only for the very smallest indenter sizes a change in mechanism was needed  @xcite .    under the assumption that the general size - effect still involves bulk plasticity mechanisms ,",

    "this latter tail is due to the different locations the dislocations can take because of the static internal stress field and the surrounding dislocation structure .",
    "inspection of the spatial structure of the initial dislocation configurations show that up to three dislocations can exist within a @xmath16 interval .",
    "inspection of the negative off - diagonal elements show approximately 60% of the elements are non - negligible and centred around a value whose magnitude is approximately half that of the diagonal elements . when this is not the case , the value is at least an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the origin of this off - diagonal structure is best seen by inspection of @xmath44 and the distance separating the dislocation pair @xmath120  fig .",
    "[ figdis1]c .",

    "inspection of the figure reveals the matrix elements are only significantly correlated up to the second and third neighbours .",
    "the picture which emerges is of a predominantly tri - diagonal matrix with off - diagonal band element values having a non - negligible probability of being quite small . viewing this matrix to be precisely a tri - diagonal matrix and with these small off - diagonal values to be identically zero results in a matrix of non - interacting smaller block matrices .",
    "this is equivalent to truncating the dislocation - dislocation interaction to a distance of approximately @xmath16 . in this limit",
    "the origin of purely localized eigenmodes becomes manifest , with the eigenmodes consisting of dislocation bunches existing within one @xmath16 unit . restoring the dislocation - dislocation interaction to its full range results in a weak interaction between the block matrices and therefore the possibility of more spatially extended eigenmodes .",
    "that both the diagonal and off - diagonal band elements are weakly correlated beyond three element indices , means that at a resolution above that of the strongly interacting block matrices , the full matrix is random .",
    "such a random block tri - diagonal matrix is similar as the one - dimensional random potential problem and the physics of anderson localization  @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "the localization phenomenon is robust against the strength of the disorder  @xcite , and  barring any long - range correlations between the random matrix elements ( not suggested by fig .",
    "[ figdis1]d and the @xmath124 dependency of the off - diagonal elements )  are expected to be localized as seen via the participation number in fig .",

    "when the applied stress equals the critical stress of the plastic event , the unstable eigenmode s eigenvalue becomes identically zero and the linearization procedure breaks down . during the subsequent regime of strong non - linearity , dislocations within the structure evolve according to eqn .",
    "[ eqneom ] , until a new stable dislocation configuration is found . at this point",
    "the plastic event has entirely arrested and the linearization procedure can once again be used . an interesting question is how related is the resulting irreversible plasticity to the unstable mode that triggers it ?    to quantify the irreversible plasticity the dislocation displacements ( taking into account the periodic boundary conditions ) between the positions at the instability and at arrest are found , giving a vector which is then normalized . taking the dot - product of this normalized plastic displacement vector with the unstable mode gives the overlap and therefore the degree of similarity between the dislocations responsible for the trigger of plasticity and those involved in the actual resulting plasticity . such an approach has been used to investigate a similar relationship in hard - sphere glasses  @xcite  see also ref .",

    "the remaining 18% percent of plastic events admit a range of lower overlaps ( marked in blue ) .    ) .",

    "this is confirmed through inspection of the participation number ( eqn .",
    "[ eqnpn ] ) of the plastic strain vector . on the other hand",
    ", the participation number of those plastic events which have a reduced overlap can have a value ranging between one and five dislocations .",
    "[ figps]b plots a histogram of the participation number of the plastic strain vector , in which the bin width is unity and each bin is centred on an integer .",
    "the observed trend my be rationalized by considering the probability , @xmath130 , that a dislocation involved in plasticity triggers another dislocation to become mobile , and so on , giving a histogram equal to @xmath131 where @xmath56 is the @xmath56th dislocation involved in the plastic event .",
    "[ figps]b includes such a curve for the optimal value of @xmath132 , indicating a dislocation involved in plasticity has the probability of @xmath133 to trigger another dislocation .",
    "this value is quite compatible with the above observation that approximately 18% of the plastic events have weak overlap with the unstable eigenmode .",
    "the general trends shown here differ little for the considered system sizes down to @xmath93 @xmath36 m .",
    "past work has shown that the present model applied to a dipolar mat geometry exhibits scale - free avalanche behaviour only when the external stress is `` tuned '' to the above yield stress  @xcite .",
    "the transition to macroscopic flow is thus characterized by a mean - field depinning transition  @xcite as discussed by dahmen and co - workers  @xcite  a result that is also the case for the single slip plane system studied presently . the first irreversible plastic event is therefore expected to not exhibit scale free avalanche behaviour , indeed the statistics of the plastic displacement shown in fig .  [ figps]b can not admit power law behaviour in the plastic strain magnitude distribution because @xmath134 .",
    "this should be compared when approaching yield , and `` tuned '' criticality . here , @xmath135 , and",
    "the plastic events can involve a very large number of dislocations and therefore a divergent plastic strain .",
    "further insight into the underlying mechanism of the first plastic event can be gained by investigating the dynamical matrix using second order eigenvalue perturbation theory .",
    "treating the off - diagonal elements of the dynamical matrix as a perturbation , rayleigh - schrdinger gives the lowest eigenvalue as @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the lowest diagonal element .",
    "the second term is always negative since @xmath138 .",
    "two approaches can be taken in assigning the labelling @xmath19 in the above equation .",
    "if the dominant term contributing to the summation arises from the second lowest diagonal element , giving the smallest denominator , then @xmath19 should reflect the numerical order of the @xmath19th diagonal element . if , on the other hand , the dominant term originates from the largest off - diagonal element , giving the largest numerator , then @xmath19 should reflect the numerical order of the spatial distance associated with the @xmath139 diagonal element . for the present case ,",
    "it is the latter , so the largest contribution always arises from the term with the largest off - diagonal element and therefore the mode closest to the spatial location of the dislocation associated with the @xmath137 element .",
    "this originates from the block structure of the matrix discussed in sec .",
    "[ ssecdm ] in which the first plastic event originates from configurations typically involving two or three dislocations within the same @xmath16 unit . because of this , the corresponding @xmath140 diagonal mode @xmath141 is considerably larger than @xmath137 .    fig .  [ figdis2]a displays a scatter - plot of the lowest eigenvalue versus the lowest dynamical matrix diagonal for @xmath35 @xmath36 m . a strong band of linear correlation is evident .",
    "the data is coloured according to the number of dislocations within the @xmath16 unit of the dislocation associated with the lowest diagonal element . for the case when the lowest eigenvalue involves two dislocations , lowest order perturbation theory ( eqn .",
    "[ eqnms ] ) is sufficient to calculate the numerical value of the corresponding eigenvalue . on the other hand , when three dislocations are involved , eqn .",
    "[ eqnms ] , provides only a good estimate and higher - order perturbation theory is needed to obtain an accurate eigenvalue due to the multiple `` scattering '' associated with the two non - negligible off - diagonal elements .",
    "[ figdis2]a therefore demonstrates two distinct dislocation environments are responsible for the first irreversible plastic event .",
    "it is noted that these two mechanisms do not explain the two classes of overlap between the instability mode and the plastic displacement considered in sec .",
    "[ ssecps ] .",
    "this suggests the extent of the resulting plasticity has more to do with the surrounding dislocation structure than those dislocations triggering the instability .",

    "[ figdis2],scaledwidth=47.0% ]    the average trend seen in fig .",
    "[ figdis2]a indicates the distribution of diagonal elements has a hard gap  @xmath142  which may be estimated by the second term of eqn .",
    "[ eqnms ] .",
    "this result is also valid for higher value pairs of diagonal elements and eigenvalues . if , @xmath143 , then the distribution of diagonal elements must be @xmath144 . what is the value of the exponent @xmath145 ?",
    "the existence of a fold catastrophe gives a direct connection between the first critical stress and the lowest eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix for the configuration prior to loading , @xmath146 , giving @xmath147 for the value @xmath148 obtained via the average first critical stress versus system size ( fig .",
    "[ figse]a ) .",
    "the observation that it is not necessarily the lowest eigenvalue which is connected to the critical stress via the fold catastrophe ( see fig .",
    "[ figeval]a ) only affects the prefactor of the above scaling , and not the scaling itself .",
    "this is because the level spacing of the first few eigenvalues scales with system size in the same way as the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "[ figdis2]b plots the eigenvalue and diagonal dynamical matrix distributions averaged over 10000 initial configurations for a system size of @xmath35 @xmath36 m along with the corresponding power law distributions ( appropriately normalised ) using the exponent @xmath149 and the diagonal element gap ( obtained from fig .  [ figdis2]a ) .",
    "agreement is seen to be quite good with some deviation close to the hard gap and for the very smallest eigenvalues .",
    "the presence of a gap may be seen without the aid of perturbation theory .",
    "in fact , to ensure the dynamical matrix is positive definite ( a necessary condition for a stable dislocation configuration ) , its components must satisfy @xmath150 where the diagonal elements are positive non - zero numbers .",
    "this is a general result for a positive definite matrix and originates from the property that every principle sub - matrix of the matrix in question must itself be positive definite , including all @xmath151 sub - matrices .",
    "the above inequality then gives @xmath152 for the present system , this maximum is always due to the @xmath72th diagonal element whose dislocation is closest to dislocation ` 1 ' .",
    "for the case of the smallest possible value of @xmath153 , the inequality in eqn .",
    "[ eqnmax ] limits to an equality , giving the minimum possible value of @xmath137 .",
    "indeed , two separate equalities emerge associated with the environments of either two or three dislocations . that this minimum is a finite positive number is due to a unique combination of the repulsive interaction between dislocations ( the dislocations can not be too close to each other ) , the pinning effect of the static internal field ( which tends to bunch dislocations within a single @xmath16 unit ) , and the surrounding dislocation environment . the specific combination of these factors giving the absolute minimum is only approached with a non - negligible probability for large enough system sizes .    the arrows in fig .",
    "[ figdis2]b indicate the average lowest eigenvalue and the average lowest diagonal element , demonstrating that they are well within the regime for which the power law behaviour is dominant .",
    "this is to be expected given the approximately linear scaling between the mean first critical stress versus system size ( fig .",
    "[ figdis2]a ) .",
    "in fact the regime of eigenvalues below that of the hard gap range corresponds ( via the fold catastrophe relation ) to a critical stress of @xmath154 , which is well outside the range of fig .",
    "[ figse]a . despite this agreement",
    ", it is expected that for large enough system sizes , weibull  @xcite fluctuations around the mean value will be affected in this stress regime : as was noticed for the system size , @xmath35 @xmath36 m , in ref .",
    "the present work has demonstrated the extreme value statistics of the critical stress of the first plastic event in a one - dimensional dislocation dynamics model may be associated with the low - end eigen - structure of the dynamical matrix of the dislocation configuration prior to loading . in particular the critical stress of a given dislocation configuration can be directly related , via a fold catastrophe , to one of the lowest eigenvalues whose corresponding eigenmode will eventually facilitate the instability leading to the first plastic event .",
    "inspection of such eigenmodes and the general statistical properties of the dynamical matrix , reveal them to be localized , involving generally only one to two dislocations .",
    "thus , despite the long range interaction between dislocations , the onset of the very first plastic event for the considered model is a localized structure .",
    "it is found that the internal static stress field ( with its imposed length and stress scales ) plays a dominant role here .",
    "it is an interesting question , if such a phenomenon may be generalized to two and three spatial dimensions for dislocation networks involving multiple active slip systems and the general phenomenon of screening . in particular ,",
    "if the characteristic disorder a particular dislocation segment experiences due to all other dislocations is of a type able to induce similar behaviour of the form seen here will be a topic of future work . the work of ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrates the extreme value statistics approach taken here is applicable to experimental nano - indentation probes of three - dimensional dislocation structure in real materials , suggesting that this might in fact be the case .",
    "furthermore , how this picture might change as a function of the @xmath56th plastic event might give fundamental insight into the more general nature of micro - plasticity , and the transition to macroscopic yield and plastic flow .",
