    "the interest in vortex states , and more generally in the rotational properties of fluids , dates back to the early days of hydrodynamics and is historically related to the phenomenon of turbulence in classical fluids . to understand the onset of chaotic dynamics and turbulence has turned out to be a formidable task , and a deep and complete understanding is still",
    "far from achieved .",
    "the realization of bose - einstein condensation of @xmath0 @xcite , and the consequent discovery of superfluidity opened up a new perspective to this aim .",
    "as in their classical counterpart , turbulence also shows up in these quantum fluids , with vortices playing a central role in the transition to chaotic motion @xcite .",
    "the advantage of investigating turbulence phenomena in superfluids is due to the constraints that quantum mechanics imposes on the values of the physical quantities that characterize the system , which simplifies to some extent the scenario with respect to its classical counterpart .",
    "for example , in order for the condensate wave function to be single valued , the circulation of the velocity field around any closed path , has to be quantized in multiples of @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the mass of the atomic species composing the condensate itself .",
    "this property leads to the concept of quantized vortices , around which the circulation ( and the angular momentum as a consequence ) is quantized @xcite . apart from the discreteness of the values of the angular momentum",
    ", a vortex in a superfluid has the remarkable property of being a particle - like stable object that does not easily decay , in contrast to viscous diffusion of vorticity , as in the case of classical fluids . because of these considerations",
    ", superfluids have become the preferred environment for investigating turbulence phenomena .",
    "the study of the dynamics of quantized vortices represented the first step to this aim .",
    "the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of alkali atoms in 1995 @xcite , gave a significant boost in this direction .",
    "because of the unprecedented control and access to physical parameters of the atomic cloud , these systems have provided an excellent experimental environment for studying the dynamics of quantized vortices and their properties in general @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been drawn to the problem of magnus like transverse forces in quantum fluids .",
    "these forces , first predicted in classical hydrodynamics , are orthogonal to the relative motion between an object , carrying a flow of circulation , and the fluid in which it is immersed .",
    "the forces at play in this situation , and their derivation , has not been without controversy . at the heart of this debate ,",
    "is the dual nature of a quantum fluid at finite temperature , where it consists of a superfluid ( condensed ) and a normal component of thermally excited quasi - particles . according to this two - fluid model , different transverse forces acting on a vortex should in principle be expected . whereas there is a wide consensus on the existence of a superfluid magnus force , which can be considered the analogue of the effect predicted by the kutta - joukowski theorem for an inviscid classical fluid ,",
    "the existence of a thermal magnus force is still the object of some debate .",
    "such forces was theoretically predicted by lifshitz and pitaevskii @xcite and iordanskii @xcite , who showed that this type of force is a consequence of the interaction between a vortex and the roton and phonon quasi - particles respectively .    recently ao and thouless @xcite contested the existence of any thermal magnus force .",
    "deircan et al @xcite arrived at the same conclusion analysing the phonon scattering by a vortex using a hydrodynamical approach .",
    "these results have been confuted by sonin @xcite , who argued it is incorrect ignoring particular properties of the born cross - section at small angles , which if included , results in a thermal transverse force .",
    "however , despite all the efforts and theoretical work done on the subject , a clear and definitive conclusion about the existence of these thermal magnus forces still remain a topic of debate .    in this paper",
    "we will study the motion of a vortex in a superfluid which is subject to a density dependent gauge potential .",
    "we will show that the resulting force on the vortex is similar to the iordanskii force . in the quest to find a physical system which would emulate a dynamical gauge theory , it has been proposed , as a first step towards such a situation , to use collisionally induced detunings in combination with synthetic magnetism arising from light - matter coupling @xcite .",
    "the resulting gauge field is not dynamical in a field theoretic sense , but it does become density dependent and therefore provides a back - action between the synthetic gauge potential and the superfluid .",
    "this results in a current nonlinearity in the equation of motion for the superfluid with dramatic consequences for the transport properties of the system @xcite .",
    "a more complete understanding of the vortex dynamics in such a system will provide important insight into phenomena such as drag forces and superfluidity of the chiral gas .",
    "we start by briefly introducing the concept of a synthetic nonlinear gauge potential . following a variational approach , we study the dynamics of the vortex core , explicitly calculating the forces acting on it .",
    "we finally validate our arguments by comparing the analytical results with a numerical solution of the generalised gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "we consider a bose einstein condensate consisting of two - level atoms , confined in a highly anisotropic trap , such that its dynamics in the transverse direction is frozen , and the system can be considered as a quasi - two - dimensional cloud of atoms , nearly free to move in a plane .",
    "it has recently been shown in @xcite that a collisionally induced detuning between the incident laser and the two atomic levels can give rise to a density dependent synthetic gauge potential .",

    "we look in particular for the forces which result from the vortex interacting with the synthetic gauge field . in order to properly take into account the vortex velocity field",
    "we need to choose the phase @xmath27 , in such a way that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 the velocity field characteristic of the vortex state , and @xmath34 the quantum of circulation . from an experimental point of view",
    "this is equivalent to preparing a vortex in the atomic cloud in absence of the gauge potentials , and then look at its dynamics once the external laser field is switched on .",
    "we next consider the vortex moving relative to the bulk condensate , where we indicate by @xmath35 the position of its core and by @xmath36 its velocity .",
    "we assume this velocity is much smaller than the speed of sound in the condensate , so that the density and phase profiles charactering the vortex , adiabatically follow the core during its motion without undergoing any distortion .",
    "we make the ansatz @xmath37 for the density of the condensate , with @xmath38 the density profile of a vortex state , which is assumed to carry a single quantum of circulation .",
