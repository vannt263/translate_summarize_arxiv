    "the study of interstellar gas in the nuclei of galaxies is key for understanding nuclear activity and circumnuclear star formation . within the central kiloparsec ,",
    "most of the gas is in the molecular phase , which makes co lines the optimal tracers of nuclear gas dynamics . up to now , however , co surveys of galaxies made with single - dish telescopes or interferometers were hampered by insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "furthermore , until very recently ( baker 2000 ; jogee et al 2001 ) , the published survey samples have included very few agn .",
    "nuga aims at filling this gap by carrying out a high resolution / sensitivity co survey of a moderately large sample of 12 nearby agn which span the whole sequence of activity types ( seyf 1 , 2 and liners ) .",
    "we seek to determine the molecular gas distributions and kinematics in the central 1kpc of the nuclei with resolutions @xmath01@xmath1 ( @xmath010 - 50@xmath5 ) , and to study the different mechanisms driving gas infall to the agn .",
    "observations in the 21 and 10 lines of @xmath6co are carried out with the iram interferometer . on the modeling side ,",
    "n - body simulations are performed to analyse the evolution of stellar / gaseous gravitational instabilities in the different study cases .",
    "nuga has a multiwavelength approach : the sample is defined based on the availability of high - quality optical and near - infrared images of the galaxies , both from ground - based telescopes and the _ hst _ ; these are essential to study how star formation proceeds in the nuclear region .",
    "the long term aim is to complete a supersample of 25 - 30 objects observed by consortium members , within and outside nuga , with the iram array .",
    "analysis of the first nuga data on 8 targets has produced a set of studies of individual galaxies which represent prototypical examples of the large variety of gravitational instabilities unveiled in the maps , including m=1 modes ( one - arm spirals , lopsided disks ) , m=2 perturbations ( rings , two - arm spirals ) and stochastic patterns ( non self - gravitating perturbations ) ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the co maps obtained in 4 galaxies ( ngc4826 , ngc1961 , ngc3718 and ngc4579 ) reveal @xmath3 perturbations , which appear as one - arm spirals and lopsided disks .",
    "asymmetric modes develop from several tens to several hundreds of pc .",
    "the maps of ngc4826 ( see garca - burillo et al .",
    "2002 ) reach so far 16pc resolution and resolve the inner molecular disk to a radius of 700pc .",
    "molecular gas mass is distributed in a 40pc - radius lopsided disk containing 15% of the total gas content , and two @xmath3 spirals at different radii .",
    "a model of the streaming motions associated with the @xmath3 perturbations suggest that the inner modes are fast trailing waves ( fig .",
    "this implies that the lopsided instability may slow down or temporarily halt gas infall .",
    "the @xmath7 co(2 - 1 ) maps of ngc1961 ( see baker et al .",
    "2002 ) partly resolve the circumnuclear disk , showing a very strong one - arm spiral instability from several hundred pc to 1.5kpc .",
    "the unsharp masked hst / nicmos map shows also a similar feature in the dust map .",
    "we have also found examples of @xmath4 perturbations ( two - arm spiral waves and gas bars ) .",
    "ngc6951 shows a very regular nuclear spiral structure , roughly coincident with the hot - spot circumnuclear ring .",
    "ngc2782 , a hybrid starburst - transition object , shows an intricate mixture of instabilities including an outer two - arm spiral , a gas bar , and a nuclear mini - spiral .",
    "ngc3147 shows a nested two - arm spiral structure and a compact source on the agn .",
    "most of the nuclear perturbations observed in nuga targets are self - gravitating gas instabilities .",
    "the co+hst images of ngc7217 identify self - gravitating perturbations in the disk and , also , stochastic instabilities on the agn ( see combes et al .",
    "the 10 map shows molecular gas confined in a very regular circular ring of 800pc radius .",
    "the 21 map shows also a compact unresolved source on the agn linked to a stochastic mini - spiral seen in the @xmath8 hst color image .",
    "combes et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have made self - consistent numerical simulations that account for the co ring morphology and the onset of central non self - gravitating perturbations .",
    "the combination of ring+stochastic waves in ngc7217 s gas distribution might reflect evolution along the seyfert sequence , with this galaxy being a more evolved seyfert .",
    "preliminary results based on still incomplete observations of 8 galaxies of the sample reveal a wide range of gravitational instabilities in the central 1kpc of nuga targets .",
    "most remarkably , @xmath3 modes appear at different spatial scales in some agns , although these modes might not _ universally _ favor agn feeding .",
    "point - symmetric @xmath4 perturbations and stochastic patterns dominate the response in others .",
    "although general conclusions will have to wait for a global analysis of the 30-galaxy supersample , these results already indicate that the correlation between activity type ( seyf 1 , 2 or liners ) and nuclear morphology of the host might be weak at scales of ten - to - hundred pc .",
    "if confirmed , the lack of a clear evolutionary scenario may reflect a mismatch between the episodic agn duty cycle , and the larger time - scales needed to build up nuclear gravitational instabilities which are directly or indirectly involved ( by the onset of nuclear starbursts ) in fueling agn ."
