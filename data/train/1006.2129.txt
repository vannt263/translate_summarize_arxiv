    "the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model is a fundamental system in epidemiological modeling @xcite and has been studied extensively within the context of non - equilibrium phase transitions and critical phenomena ( i.e. , @xcite ) .",
    "the model was developed to describe the propagation of an epidemic that occurs during a period of time much smaller than the lifetime of individuals of a given population .",
    "it is assumed that the population can be divided into three categories : susceptible ( s ) , infected ( i ) and recovered ( r ) individuals .",
    "susceptible individuals become infected at a given rate through contact with infected individuals .",
    "infected individuals recover with a given rate and become immune and recovered .",
    "the model is capable of showing a threshold of the epidemic spreading as one increases the infection rate .",
    "the sir process has been studied using different approaches and contexts .",
    "originally it was defined in 1927 by kermack and mckendrick @xcite as a deterministic process by means of a set of ordinary differential equations ; they showed that epidemics disappear before all the susceptible individuals contract the disease .",
    "afterwards the model was given a stochastic description by means of birth and death processes @xcite , and later grassberger @xcite introduced a cellular automaton implementation , that is , a synchronous - update markovian process on a lattice . in this paper we consider a stochastic , asynchronous - update lattice version of the sir model @xcite , in which lattice sites are updated one at a time .",
    "this model is a special case of the predator - prey stochastic lattice - gas model introduced by satulovky and tom @xcite , and also considered by antal et al .",
    "it is also a special case of the susceptible - infected - removed - susceptible ( sirs ) stochastic lattice gas model @xcite . for the synchronous or asynchronous versions of the sir process",
    ", one observes that , as the model parameters are varied , a phase transition takes place .",
    "this is a continuous phase transition between two distinct regimes : one in which the population remains susceptible ( non - spreading regime ) and another in which the epidemic spreads over the lattice ( spreading regime ) , where a significant portion of the population becomes infected and eventually immune . at the transition",
    "the system becomes critical and corresponds to the epidemic threshold .",
    "cardy and grassberger @xcite argued that the transition found in the sir cellular automaton is of the percolation universality class .",
    "this has been confirmed in various ways by numerous studies in stochastic models with synchronous as well as asynchronous update @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been a great deal of interest in the sir model on networks and other systems ( i.e. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the sir model on the square lattice , which has wide applications to many physical problems such as the spread of disease in plants , and which has been studied only to a limited extent @xcite .",
    "one question that has come up in the context of mean field and network studies is the effect of heterogeneity in the infectious period @xcite .",
    "when the period of infection is fixed , there is a direct mapping of the model to bond percolation on the lattice , and thus the transition point can be determined exactly @xcite .",
    "however , when the infection period is heterogeneous , such as the exponentially distributed infection period inherent to the original sir model , there is no exact solution . in this paper , we carry out a careful numerical study of the transition point for the exponentially distributed case , and then investigate the correlations in the transmission of the infection to the nearest neighbors .",
    "we work out the correlations explicitly , and find that at the critical point there is a higher probability to infect more rather than fewer of the neighbors , unlike the case of bond percolation where the distribution of infected neighbors is simply binomial with @xmath4 .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : master ] we define the asynchronous sir model in terms of the master equation . in section [ sec : simulations ] we describe the monte - carlo algorithm that we use , and in section [ sec : numerical ] we carry out a numerical analysis of the cluster size distribution of recovered individuals to precisely determine the critical point of the model . in section [ sec : perc ] we show in detail how the asynchronous sir model differs from percolation on a local scale . in section [ sec : other ] we discuss the relation of our results to some other population biology models , and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we give our conclusions .",
    "to model the dynamics of an epidemic with immunization we consider a stochastic lattice - gas model with asynchronous dynamics .",
    "the lattice plays the role of the spatial region occupied by the individuals and the lattice sites are the possible locations for the individuals .",
    "each site can be occupied by just one individual that can be either a susceptible , an infected , or a recovered individual , called , respectively , an s site , i site and r site . at each time",
    "step a site is randomly chosen and the following rules are applied : ( i ) if the chosen site is in state s or r it remains unchanged .",
    "( ii ) if it is in state i then ( a ) with probability @xmath1 the chosen site becomes r and ( b ) with the complementary probability @xmath5 a neighboring site is chosen at random .",
    "if the chosen neighboring site is in state s it becomes i ; otherwise it remains unchanged .",
    "notice that a site in state r remains forever in this state so that the allowed transitions are s@xmath6i@xmath6r . from this set of dynamic rules",
    "it follows that the state of the system will change only when the chosen site is in state i , a feature that will be used to speed up the simulation as explained in section [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "this algorithm is equivalent to making s@xmath6i with probability @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of nearest - neighbor i sites , and i@xmath6r with probability @xmath1 .",
    "the system evolves in time according to a master equation .",
    "to each site @xmath9 of a two - dimensional lattice , we associate a stochastic variable @xmath10 that takes the values @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 according to whether the site @xmath9 is occupied by an r or an s or an i individual , respectively .",
    "a microscopic configuration of the entire system is denoted by the stochastic vector @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total number of sites . because the possible transitions are the cyclic ones ( @xmath16 ) , it is convenient to define the state @xmath17 obtained by a cyclic permutation of the state of site @xmath9 , that is , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is @xmath12 , @xmath13 , or @xmath11 according to whether @xmath20 is @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the master equation for the probability distribution @xmath21 associated with the microscopic configuration @xmath22 at time @xmath23 , is given by @xmath24 @xmath25 where the summation on @xmath9 extends over the nearest - neighbor sites of site @xmath26 and @xmath27 denotes the state obtained from @xmath22 by an _",
    "permutation of state ( 0@xmath62@xmath61 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is the transition rate associated with the infection process , given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number of nearest - neighboring sites of site @xmath26 ( the lattice coordination number ) and @xmath31 is the kronecker delta ; and @xmath32 is the transition rate for the recovery process , given by @xmath33 two external parameters are associated to these processes : the infection rate @xmath34 and the recovery rate @xmath35 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath36 and @xmath1 are related to these rates by @xmath37 and @xmath38 so that @xmath39 as it should .    from the master equation ( [ 2 ] ) we can derive the time evolution equations for the densities of recovered @xmath40 , susceptible @xmath41 , and infected @xmath42 .",
    "the connection of the present stochastic lattice model with the approach developed by kermack and mckendrick @xcite can be revealed by using a simple mean - field approximation . within this approximation",
    "@xcite the following set of ordinary differential equations for the densities can be derived @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 these equations are essentially the equations introduced by kermack and mckendrick @xcite in their deterministic approach for the spreading of a disease with immunization .    to analyze an epidemic",
    ", one can begin from an initial condition at time @xmath46 where all the individuals are susceptible , with the exception of a very small number of infected individuals ; that is , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . using this initial condition and eqs .  (",
    "[ eq : meanfield1]-[eq : meanfield3 ] ) , one finds that the system evolves in time and reaches two types of states : one where the epidemic spreads , that is , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , when @xmath53 , which occurs for sufficiently large values of the infection probability @xmath36 , and another where the epidemic does not spread , that is , @xmath54 when @xmath53 , which occurs for small values of @xmath36 . as one varies the parameter @xmath36",
    ", there is a continuous phase transition at @xmath55 . in stochastic lattice models",
    "one expects similar behavior but a distinct value for the critical parameters . in that case one",
    "starts with a lattice full of susceptible individuals with the exception of a single infected individual , and studies the epidemics that ensue .",
    "the asynchronous sir model may be simulated by a kinetic monte - carlo process by following procedure :    * pick an i site randomly from a list of all i sites . *",
    "generate a random number @xmath56 in @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath58 then let i @xmath6 r. * otherwise ( if @xmath59 ) , pick one nearest neighbor of the i site randomly . if the neighbor is s , then make it i and add to list of i sites .",
    "* repeat as long as there are available i sites .",
    "when we remove an i site from the list in the first step , we swap the empty location with the site at the top of the list and decrease the list length by one in order to keep the list compact .",
    "new i sites in the third step are added to the top of the list .",
    "the monte - carlo time @xmath23 is determined by incrementing @xmath23 by @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the current number of i sites on the list , each time an i is picked from the list .",
    "this reflects an effective increase of one monte - carlo step if every site on the lattice were chosen once , on the average .",
    "however , as explained below , we do nt actually keep track of time in our simulations , but instead monitor just the size ( number of r sites ) of the clusters .",
    "this model is closely related to standard percolation growth , in which an active growth site spreads to an unoccupied nearest neighbor with the given bond probability .",
    "however , in the percolation case , as described below , the growth site becomes inactive after the four nearest neighbors are checked ( for both asynchronous and synchronous updating ) . in the sir model",
    ", the i site remains active an exponentially distributed length of time , and can thus attempt to infect neighboring sites multiple times .",
    "that behavior leads to a kind of correlation in the spreading in the sir model , as we shall see .    in order to study properties of this model in detail ,",
    "it is necessary to know the transition point to high accuracy .",
    "recent work @xcite has shown that @xmath62 , where the number in parentheses represents the error in the last digit . in this , paper",
    ", we find @xmath63 to about 200 times the accuracy , and indeed , in so doing , we find nearly complete agreement with the previous central value .",
    "to find the transition point , we consider the statistics of the cluster size distribution , and determine @xmath63 as the point where the distribution follows a power law . according to standard percolation theory ,",
    "the probability @xmath64 that a point belongs to a cluster containing @xmath65 sites is given by @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of clusters of size @xmath65 ( per site ) on the lattice . at criticality ,",

    "if one extrapolates this line to @xmath189 , @xmath190 , which corresponds to the sir model ( that is , suppressing the parameter @xmath183 ) , one gets @xmath191 or @xmath192 for the net probability that i@xmath6s rather than tries to infect one neighbor .",
    "this value should be compared to the critical value for the sir process @xmath193 .",
    "alternatively , we may compare the infection probability @xmath194 with the critical infection probability for the sir model @xmath195 .",
    "it follows that epidemic spreading for the sir model occurs for a greater value of the infection probability than the corresponding value for the sis model .",
    "this is expected because , in the sis model , an s individual can be infected multiple times .",
    "we have provided further evidence that the asynchronous sir model is in the universality class of standard percolation through the behavior of the cluster size distribution .",
    "we showed that local correlations differ from those of standard percolation . by extensive numerical simulation of the cluster size distribution",
    ", we have shown that the transition in the sir model defined on the square lattice occurs at @xmath0 , consistent with , but much more precise than , previous work @xcite .",
    "this critical value of @xmath1 compares with @xmath153 for the sir model on the 4-coordinated bethe lattice , @xmath196 for the contact process ( or sis model ) on the square lattice , and @xmath197 for simultaneous infection of all neighboring s sites on the square lattice ( site percolation ) .",
    "having an accurate value of @xmath63 is useful for other studies of this critical state , such as studying the scaling of the average cluster size with @xmath198 for finite systems @xcite .",
    "_ note added in revision_. while this paper was under review , a paper appeared online @xcite in which heterogeneity of the transmissibility in a square - lattice sir model was also considered . in that paper ,",
    "the heterogeneity is formed by having classes of individuals each with different fixed transmissibilities @xmath199 corresponding to having different fixed infections times . in terms of the correlations we studied , each of these classes of individuals produce a binomial distribution for @xmath116 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : binomial ] ) with @xmath113 replaced by @xmath199 , and by taking a set of classes it is possible for example to reproduce the exponential infectivity distribution exactly . our critical transmissibility @xmath200 and its mean square deviation @xmath201 are consistent with the approximate criticality correlation these authors develop .",
    "more details will be given in a future publication .",
    "it should also be mentioned that that paper contains many references to epidemiological systems where a lattice - based sir model is relevant .",
    "this work was supported by the brazilian agency cnpq and inct of complex fluids ( cnpq and fapesp ) ( t.t . ) , and supported in part by the u.  s.  national science foundation grant no .",
    "dms-0553487 ( r.m.z . ) .",
    "consider that there are @xmath114 nearest - neighbor s sites to a given i site , and four nearest neighbors total .",
    "then we define :      with @xmath205 ; @xmath206 , @xmath207 .",
    "given @xmath126 defined in ( [ eq : pn ] ) , the net probability that @xmath117 sites of type s are visited is given by @xmath208 we can write recursion relations to find the @xmath209 .",
    "for example , for @xmath210 we have @xmath211 the first expression states that the probability that the s site was not visited at the @xmath127-th trial is @xmath212 the probability it was not visited in the previous trial , as three out of four of the neighbors are not an s site .",
    "likewise , for the second expression , if the s was not visited in the previous trials , then in one out of four times the s will be chosen for the first time in the @xmath127-th trial , while if the s site was visited in some previous trial , then it will surely still have been visited in this trial .    to solve the recursion relations",
    ", we use the generating functions , defined for general @xmath114 by @xmath213 a straightforward application to ( [ eq : p10]-[eq : p11 ] ) yields @xmath214 according to ( [ eq : convolute ] ) , we have simply @xmath215 and we thus find @xmath216 which satisfies @xmath217 .    likewise , for @xmath218 , we have @xmath219 and similarly one can write the recursions for @xmath220 and 4 .",
    "in fact one can summarize them for all @xmath114 by the general formulas @xmath221 for @xmath222 , and derive a general recursion relation for the averaged quantities for all @xmath223 : @xmath224      note that it is possible to write explicit formulas for all the @xmath209 , such as @xmath226 where the coefficients in some cases are related to stirling numbers of the second kind . also , we can generalize ( [ eq : recursion1]-[eq : recursion2 ] ) to all coordination numbers @xmath154 simply by replacing all 4 s in those equations by @xmath154 s .",
    "then one can show that @xmath227 for @xmath228 , and taking @xmath229 , one can verify directly that @xmath230 ."
