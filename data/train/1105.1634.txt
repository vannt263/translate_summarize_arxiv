    "the standard model ( sm ) are known to have three families of charged and neutral fermions .",
    "there is however no upper limit on the number of fermion families .",
    "a fourth family ( sm4 )  @xcite could be in fact the key to many unsolved puzzles , such as the hierarchies of the fermion mass spectrum including neutrino masses and mixing , electroweak symmetry breaking , baryogenesis , and a variety of interesting phenomena in cp and flavor physics  @xcite .",
    "fourth family leptons and quarks have been searched for previously by the lep and tevatron experiments and now by the lhc experiments .",
    "the most stringent lower mass limits at 95% cl are  @xcite @xmath2 the mass bound on the heavy neutrino depends on the type of neutrino ( dirac or majorana ) and whether one considers a coupling of the heavy neutrino to @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "it should also be noted that assumptions about the coupling of the fourth family and the decay mode were made in deriving the quark mass limits .",
    "the limits can be weaker without these assumptions .",
    "on the other hand , the triviality bound from unitarity of the @xmath5 @xmath6-wave scattering  @xcite indicates a maximum @xmath7 mass of around 500gev , although this estimate is based on tree - level expressions .    with the presence of fourth family quarks , the dominant higgs production process , the gluon - gluon fusion process ,",
    "is further enhanced ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] and also  @xcite ) . using the large enhancement of @xmath8 in sm4 , cdf , d0 and cms have been able to exclude the sm4 higgs boson at 95% cl for @xmath9gev  @xcite and @xmath10gev  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , it was pointed out that the mass limit on @xmath11 ( eq.([eq : nu4_limit ] ) ) was derived when the mixing angle between the fourth family neutrino and at least one of the neutrinos in the sm is assumed to be larger than @xmath12 . for smaller mixing angles , @xmath13 is quasistable and the mass of @xmath13 is bounded only from the analysis of @xmath14 boson decay at @xmath15gev  @xcite . in this case , the decay mode @xmath16 becomes the dominant one at low higgs mass and the tevatron lower mass limits of 131gev would be increased to 155gev  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will not consider this possibility .",
    "in the sm , the dominant higgs production process is the gluon - gluon fusion process where gluons from colliding beams couple to a heavy quark loop from which the higgs boson is emitted .",

    "this is why in the sm , the top quark is by far the dominant contribution .    in a fourth generation with two additional heavier quark @xmath7 and @xmath34 ,",
    "the higgs production cross section is enhanced with that of the sm by a factor @xmath35 the dependence as a function of the higgs boson mass @xmath36 is shown in fig .",

    "the heavy @xmath43 scenario may not be physical as when it is beyond about @xmath44gev the weak interaction among heavy particles becomes strong and perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "however , since the enhancement is the smallest , the resulting exclusion limits would be more conservative .",
    "this is the scenario used by cms in their recent publication  @xcite .",
    "the other scenario with @xmath45gev corresponds to one of the scenarios used by the tevatron experiments  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsigma ] , the enhancement based on lo cross sections is also compared with the corresponding factor in nlo calculated with a modified higlu program  @xcite  .",
    "the cross sections @xmath46 are calculated for @xmath47 collisions at 7tev center - of - mass energy   has essentially no dependence on it . ] .",
    "as far as the ratio @xmath48 is concerned , the difference between nlo and lo is small .",
    "this means that one may use this ratio ( e.g.  in nlo ) and precisely predicted sm cross section values in higher orders to derive the corresponding higher - order cross section in a fourth generation model : @xmath49 indeed , use this relation and take the nnlo cross section value @xmath50 pb at @xmath51gev as an example ( table  1 in  @xcite ) and the corresponding enhancement factor of 9.223 ( see the linked web page below ) , we obtain 182.79pb for the low mass scenario .",
    "this derived cross section value @xmath52 is in excellent agreement with the independent prediction of 182.51pb given in table  1 in  @xcite .",
    "the sm higgs decay branching fractions calculated using hdecay  @xcite is displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : br ] .",
    "the decay mode @xmath53 is the reverse of the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath54 .",
    "the partial decay width of the decay mode @xmath53 in a fourth generation model with respect to that of the sm is thus enhanced by the same factor as the corresponding higgs production cross section in the gluon - gluon fusion process ( eq.([eq : rsigma ] ) ) .",
    "the decay mode @xmath55 is similar to @xmath53 except that charged leptons , the @xmath56-boson and charged higgs bosons also contribute to the loop .",
    "the partial decay width is  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the fine - structure coupling constant .",

    "[ fig : br_sm4 ] ) in a fourth generation model look different from that of the sm in particular for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath1 modes at low higgs mass values .",
    "tev ( left ) and @xmath72gev ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ] tev ( left ) and @xmath72gev ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    in fig .  [ fig : br_sm4 ] , the two mass scenarios are compared .",
    "the @xmath68 mass is further assumed to be the same as that of @xmath34 .",
    "but as far as these fourth generation quark and lepton masses are heavy enough ( @xmath73 ) , the difference in branching fractions is hardly visible .",
    "the branching fractions in a fourth generation model are calculated without applying the electroweak and higher - order qcd corrections as they do not apply to the fourth generation quarks .",

    "one advantage of reporting @xmath48 instead of @xmath82 that we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : sigma ] is that the ratio is less sensitive to higher order corrections .",
