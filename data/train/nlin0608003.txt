    "the investigation of the chaotic processes in the deterministic systems is one of the most important trends of the modern physics @xcite . the successes of this current for nonlinear classical systems that are described via trajectories of the system in hilbert space are obvious @xcite .",
    "yet the conception of deterministic chaos in quantum systems , where the idea of trajectory is inapplicable , stays a subject for serious discussions so far .",
    "there is no common understanding of the problem of quantum chaos for today .",
    "usually the quantum chaos is considered as a set of phenomena taking place in quantum systems , the classical analogues of which display chaos @xcite .",
    "generally when investigating the problems of quantum chaos , one has to deal with the hamiltonians of the form : @xmath0 where p , q are a set of classical coordinates and momentum , @xmath1 is classically integrable part of hamiltonian , @xmath2 is a part of hamiltonian which leads to the nonintegrability of the classical equations of motion when added , @xmath3 is a parameter by variation of which the system may be driven in the domain of chaotic dynamics .",
    "the goal of this work is the investigation of a concrete physical system described by the hamiltonian of the form ( 1.1 ) .",
    "the object of our investigation is a diamagnetic hydrogen atom placed in a strong magnetic field .",
    "diamagnetic hydrogen atom , subjected to the influence of the strong magnetic field , has been considered in the quasi - classical approximation in the ref @xcite .",
    "namely a photo - absorbtion spectrum in the transition regime to chaos has been studied .",
    "the main purpose of our work is the investigation of the irreversible evolution of the quantum - mechanical system and the passage from the quantum - mechanical to the quantum - statistical consideration .",
    "we shall try to compare and find out the link between the phenomena taking place under both classical and quantum considerations .",
    "relatively weak magnetic field applied to atom leads just to the energy levels splitting , i.e. to the zeeman effect . in case when the hydrogen atom is placed in the extreme high magnetic field",
    ", the motion of the electron in the plane perpendicular to the field direction is completely defined by this magnetic field and not by the coulomb field of the nucleus , and because of this , the atom is found to be deformed in the transverse direction . at the same time",
    "the field does not affect on the lengthwise motion , and in this direction the atom keeps its size .",
    "one may easily estimate the value of the magnetizing force when the deformation of the electron shell takes place .",
    "one has to compare the value of bohr radius @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is a plank constant , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the electron mass and charge respectively ) with a characteristic size of the localization domain of electrons in the magnetic field in the ground state when @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 . if @xmath11 , then the magnetic field has the defining effect .",
    "this condition leads to the following estimate of the extremely strong field @xmath12 in which the atom is deformed .",
    "notice , that the magnetic fields required for this , the intensity of which is defined by the condition ( 1.2 ) , according to the modern concepts , may exist on the surface of some astrophysical objects .",
    "the neutron stars ( or pulsars ) appearing as the result of the collapse of the supernova , belong to them .",
    "that is why the investigation of the diamagnetic atoms in the conditions of extremely high magnetic fields is of doubtless interest .",

    "the change of the kinetic energy of the electron will occur .",
    "this change is conditioned by the addition to the velocity of in the rotating coordinate frame @xmath16 the cross - product of the larmor frequency @xmath17 and the vector @xmath18 of the location of electron .",
    "taking into account , that the direction of vector @xmath17 is opposite to the vector @xmath19 , and gyromagnetic ratio of the electron is @xmath20 ( here @xmath21 is the velocity of light ) , we shall achieve for the velocity of electron in a motionless coordinate frame : @xmath22=\\vec{u}+\\frac{e}{2m_ec}[\\vec{b}\\vec{r}].\\ ] ] then the kinetic energy of the electron will be of form : @xmath23\\vec{u}+\\frac{1}{2}m_e\\lvert[\\vec{\\omega}_l\\vec{r}]\\rvert^2=\\\\ = \\frac{1}{2}m_eu^2+\\frac{e}{2m_ec}bl_z+\\frac{e^2}{8m_ec^2}b^2(x^2+y^2 ) .",

    "the form of the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) is similar to the one of ( 1.1 ) . for @xmath27 the equations corresponding to ( 2.1 )",
    "are integrable . for @xmath28",
    "the system is nonintegrable . finally with the increase of the amplitude of the magnetic field , starting with some definite value of @xmath29",
    ", the dynamics appears to be chaotic .",
    "the use of the numerical methods for the hamiltonian of the form ( 2.1 ) is connected with definite difficulties because of the appearance of singularity in the @xmath30 point .    to get over this problem",
    "it is necessary to use semiparabolic coordinates that are connected with the cartesian ones via formulas : @xmath31 and make a transition to a non - homogeneous time via transformation @xmath32 @xcite . then taking into account that @xmath24 , the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) can be transformed to the following form @xcite : @xmath33 i.e. the hamiltonian is of form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the integrable part of the hamiltonian ; @xmath36 is the nonintegrable part of the hamiltonian .    as one may see from ( 2.2a ) , the transformed hamiltonian by its form coincides with the hamiltonian of interacting oscillators , and in ( 2.2 ) the singularities which are typical for the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) are absent .",
    "though one should take into account , that during the direct numerical calculations , right after the integration of the hamilton equations corresponding to ( 2.2a ) , one has to perform a reverse transition to a real time .",
    "henceforth the transformed hamiltonian will be the object of our investigations in case of classical consideration .    as it is clear from ( 2.2 ) , the value of the magnetic field @xmath37 is the parameter of nonlinearity . we shall study a case of a strong nonlinearity , i.e. the case when the methods of perturbation theory are inapplicable . in such case",
    "the chaos may appear in the system .",

    "all the frequencies ( periods ) in a finite frequency interval @xmath49 are involved into oscillatory process.,width=283 ]    there is one more interesting property of dynamical systems connected with the kolmogorov entropy that describes chaotic motion and is called poincar recurrence .",
    "the main point of the poincar recurrence is that any system with a finite phase space after some definite time returns to its initial state @xcite .",
    "the study of the time of poincar recurrence is one of the most powerful methods of the analysis of the nonlinear systems .",
    "it turned out to be that in conditions of strong chaos ( i.e. when the phase plane does nt contain the stability islands ) the distribution of the times of poincar recurrences has a lorenz structure @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the average recurrence time connected with kolmogorov entropy as @xmath52 .",
    "thus , calculating the value of the kolmogorov entropy one can define the distribution of the recurrence times .",
    "we in details touched upon the question about classical poincar recurrences , because henceforth we will be interested in quantum poincar recurrences .",
    "the idea of quantum poincar recurrence was introduced in the recently published work by g. m. zaslavsky and a. iomin @xcite .",
    "we shall return to the description of this phenomenon during a quantum consideration .",
    "one of the signs of the appearance of chaos is a discrete ( fractal ) dimension of the phase space of the system .    for estimation of the fractal dimension we shall use the grassberger - procaccia algorithm @xcite .",
    "the main point of this algorithm consists into following :    assume we have obtained from a numerical solution of the equations of motion a set of state vectors @xmath53 that correspond to the sequential steps of integration . in our case",

    "as it has been already mentioned , usually the quantum chaos is considered as a set of phenomena that appear in quantum systems , the classical analogues of which display chaos .",
    "the difficulty in definition of quantum chaos is connected with a fact , that the concepts characterizing classical chaos ( local instability of phase trajectories ) lose their sense in quantum consideration .",
    "therefore , for describing quantum chaos one has to use methods and concepts which are typical for quantum mechanics .",
    "our goal in case of quantum consideration , is the demonstration of the fact that one of the signs of the quantum chaos is a formation of the mixed state . for endorsement of this assumption we shall use methods of random matrix theory @xcite . due to this fact",
    ", we have to use basis of eigenfunctions of the integrable part of the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) and we can not expend the wave function in landau states , as was done in @xcite .",
    "this makes situation more complicated but as we are interested in the state @xmath73 , some analytical results still can be obtained .",
    "let us write down the schrdinger equation for the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) @xmath74 it is easily seen from ( 3.1 ) , that the schrdinger equation in contrast to the classical equations of hamilton is linear . like in the case of classical systems , this conclusion means that eq.(3.1 ) is completely deterministic and does not contain the properties of chaos , the main sign of which is fortuity and abruptness of the behavior of system .",
    "because of this the question appears : then how can one observe nonregular behavior and quantum chaos in the quantum systems ? to answer this question",
    "we shall use some well - known facts from quantum mechanics [ 23,24,25 ] .",
    "let us define via @xmath75 the required eigenfunction of the eq.(3.1 ) and expand it in eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath76 @xmath77 here @xmath78 is the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian @xmath79 .",

    "if when taking sum by @xmath87 a totality ( infinite number ) of functions @xmath88 is considered . however the wave function @xmath75 from a qualitative point of view may be with a high degree of accuracy described by the expansion like ( 3.2 ) using a finite number @xmath89 @xmath90 of states @xmath91the further increase of the number of states @xmath92 is similar to the tendency of the plank constant to zero @xmath93 and leads to the improvement of quantitative fit between classical and quantum chaos @xcite .    according to the premises",
    "one may say , that the problem of finding eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of hamiltonian @xmath94 may be solved by a numeric diagonalization of the matrix equation ( 3.4 ) .",
    "but here a question is born .",
    "if the state of the system is described by a finite superposition of regular states @xmath81 then the state @xmath75 is regular too , so where should one look for a nonregular behavior of the system ?    by the assumption taken for today @xcite the properties of chaos in quantum system are revealed in that sense that matrix ( 3.5 ) is a random matrix , all the elements of which are random values .",
    "based on this , there must exist some correspondence between matrix ( 3.5 ) and the quantities describing classical chaos . using our problem as a pattern we shall start to examine this question .",
    "let us start with quantum mechanical investigation of the hamiltonian ( 2.2 ) . as it has been already mentioned , when the external magnetic field is absent@xmath27 the hamiltonian @xmath95 is exactly integrable .",
    "when the external magnetic field is turned on @xmath96 the hamiltonian becomes nonintegrable , and for some definite value @xmath97 the solutions of the classical equations corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath98 display chaos .",
    "by analogy with classical chaos , when a set of phase trajectories with a small dispersion of initial conditions is investigated , we shall consider a small increment of the parameter @xmath99using the basis of functions in which hamiltonian @xmath100 is diagonal , for small values of @xmath101 the hamiltonian @xmath102 may be represented as a sum of two matrices : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a diagonal matrix , @xmath37 is a banded matrix , the elements of which are random numbers . by a numerical diagonalization , one can define the eigenfunctions @xmath105 @xmath106 and eigenvalues @xmath107 @xmath108 corresponding to the @xmath94 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "we are interested in the interval of energy @xmath109 which is small from a classical point of view , and large from a quantum mechanical one ( with relation to the large number of quantum levels contained in this interval ) .",
    "let us begin to the quantum mechanical analysis of the hamiltonian ( 2.1 ) .",
    "the eigenvectors of the basis , in which hamiltonian is diagonal , can be found easily and are of the form @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the normalized radial part of the wave function and @xmath112 @xmath113 are the spherical and hyper - geometrical functions respectively @xcite ; @xmath114 @xmath64 and @xmath115 denotes the spherical coordinates .    as was mentioned above , using of the symmetric kepler problem s eigenfunctions is connected to the requirements of the random matrix theory .",
    "calculation of non - diagonal matrix elements in this basis is more complicated then in landau basis @xcite .",
    "but the fact that we are interested in the state @xmath116 @xmath117 makes life and it s still possible to obtain some analytical results .",
    "actually the problem is reduced to the calculation of the following matrix elements : @xmath118    these matrix elements can be calculated analytically . as a result for diagonal matrix elements we get @xcite : @xmath119 and non - diagonal matrix elements",
    "can be reduced to the calculation of the following integral : @xmath120 @xmath121 where @xmath122 direct calculation of the integral @xmath123 is not possible .",
    "but we can use recurrence formula , which connects integral @xmath123 and integrals with the lower values of superscript @xmath124 ; @xmath125 .",

    "at the discussion of the nonreversible evolution of the quantum -mechanical system , naturally the question emerges .",
    "how in a quantum system originates non -reversibility ? if the quantum system evolves according to the schrdinger equation , how can a pure quantum -mechanical state become a mixed one ?",
    "the question is that , in contrast to the classical chaos , quantum mechanically irregular motion can not be characterized by extreme sensitivity to tiny changes of the initial data . due to the unitarity of the quantum dynamics ,",
    "the overlap of two wave functions remains time - independent @xmath130 provided time - dependence of @xmath131 and @xmath132 is generated by the same hamiltonian .",
    "however , an alternative characterization of classical chaos , extreme sensitivity to slight changes of the dynamics does carry over into quantum mechanics .",

    "suppose we can find eigenvectors @xmath143 of the floquet operator @xmath144 then , with the eigenvalue problem solved , the stroboscopic dynamics can be written out explicitly @xcite @xmath145 as it was mentioned above , our aim is to proof that one of the signs of the emergence of quantum chaos is a formation of the mixed state .",
    "being initially in a pure quantum mechanical state , described by the wave function @xmath146 the system during the evolution makes an irreversible transition to the mixed state .",
    "after the formation of a mixed state the quantum - mechanical description loses its sense and we have to use a quantum - statistical interpretation . to prove the formation of the mixed state , one has to show the zeroing of non - diagonal elements of density matrix , the equality of which to zero is a sign of a mixed state @xcite .    taking ( 4.5 ) into account , we obtain for non diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix : @xmath147 where @xmath148 , @xmath149 means averaging over time .    for",
    "averaging let us recollect that value @xmath150 is the eigenvalue of the floquet operator .",

    "consequently the concept of a wave function loses its meaning and the poincar recurrences are out of the question . but what happens when @xmath196 ?",
    "we shall clear up this question in the given section .",

    "this fact can be easily explained , taking into account the existence of a strong classical chaos ( i.e. the absence of the stability islands in the phase space ) .",
    "the lorentz form testifies that if @xmath217 , quantum poinacr recurrences are improbable .",
    "this coincides with the results of the previous section , according to which the system is found in a mixed state in this time interval .",
