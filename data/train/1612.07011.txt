    "matrix polynomials with special algebraic structures occur in numerous applications in engineering , mechanics , control , linear systems theory , and computer - aided graphic design .",
    "some of the most common of these algebraic structures that appear in applications are the ( skew-)symmetric @xcite , ( anti-)palindromic @xcite , and alternating structures @xcite . palindromic matrix polynomials appear , to name a few applications , in the study of resonance phenomena of rail tracks under high frequency excitation forces @xcite , in the numerical simulation of the behavior of periodic surface acoustic wave filters @xcite , in passivity tests of a linear dynamical system @xcite , and in discrete - time linear - quadratic optimal control problems @xcite .",
    "symmetric ( or hermitian ) matrix polynomials arise in the classical problem of vibration analysis @xcite , and alternating matrix polynomials find applications , for instance , in the study of corner singularities in anisotropic elastic materials @xcite , in the study of gyroscopic systems @xcite , and in continuous - time linear - quadratic optimal control problems @xcite .",
    "further details of different applications of ( structured and unstructured ) matrix polynomials can be found in the classical references @xcite , the modern surveys ( * ? ? ?",

    "the development and investigation of polynomial eigensolvers that are able to exploit and preserve the structure that the matrix polynomials might possess , have been the focus of an intense research during the last decade ( see , for example ( * ? ? ?",

    "polynomial eigenvalue problems _ ( peps ) , while singular matrix polynomials are related to _ complete polynomial eigenvalue problems _",
    "( cpes ) , since in the singular case the so called minimal indices have to be considered in addition to the eigenvalues .",
    "when the spectral symmetries of structured matrix polynomials are taken into account ( i.e. , they have to be preserved in the computed solution ) , those problems receive the names of _ structured polynomial eigenvalue problems _ ( speps ) and _ structured complete polynomial eigenvalue problems _ ( scpes ) , respectively . the standard approach to solve a pep or",
    "a cpe ( or a spep or a scpe ) associated with a matrix polynomial @xmath1 is to linearize @xmath1 into a matrix pencil ( i.e. , a matrix polynomial of degree 1 ) .",
    "linearization transforms the original polynomial eigenvalue problem into an equivalent generalized eigenvalue problem , which can be solved by using mature and well - understood generalized eigensolvers such as the qz algorithm or the staircase algorithm @xcite or their structured counterparts @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "one of the preferred approaches to develop structured numerical methods for solving speps and scpes associated with structured matrix polynomials starts by devising structure - preserving linearizations @xcite .",
    "the theory of linearizing structured matrix polynomials in a structure preserving way is already well - understood @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that any odd - degree structured matrix polynomial in the classes listed in the first paragraph of this section can be linearized in a structure - preserving way , regardless of whether the matrix polynomial is regular or singular .",
    "however , some even - degree structured matrix polynomials in these classes do not have any linearization with the same structure due to some spectral subtle obstructions ( * ? ? ?",

    "/ odd - degree dichotomy for the existence of classes of structure - preserving linearizations , we only consider in this work numerical methods based on structure - preserving linearizations for solving speps or scpes associated with odd - degree matrix polynomials .",
    "one interesting recent advance in the theory of linearizations of matrix polynomials has been the introduction of the family of ( strong ) block minimal bases pencils @xcite , since many of the linearizations that have appeared previously in the literature are included in this family of pencils @xcite and , in addition , allow a simple , concise , and unified theory @xcite .",
    "a particular but very important subfamily of strong block minimal bases pencils is the family of block kronecker pencils @xcite .",
    "block kronecker pencils include ( modulo permutations ) all fiedler linearizations @xcite , but infinitely many more linearizations are also included in this family .",
    "all the linearizations belonging to the family of block kronecker pencils have the following properties that are very desirable in numerical applications :    * they are strong linearizations , regardless whether the matrix polynomial is regular or singular ; * they are easily constructible from the coefficients of the matrix polynomials ; * eigenvector of regular matrix polynomials are easily recovered from those of the linearizations ; * minimal bases of singular matrix polynomials are easily recovered from those of the linearizations ; * there exists a simple shift relation between the minimal indices of singular matrix polynomials and the minimal indices of the linearizations , and such relation is robust under perturbations ; * they guarantee global backward stability of polynomial eigenvalue problems solved via block kronecker linearizations .    additionally , block kronecker pencils have been generalized to allow one to construct strong linearizations for matrix polynomials that are expressed in some non - monomial polynomial bases @xcite .",
    "another key advantage of the family of strong block minimal bases pencils is that one can find easily in it structure - preserving strong linearizations for odd - degree structured matrix polynomials in relevant structured classes ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) .",
    "this observation has led to the introduction of the family of structured block kronecker pencils @xcite .",
    "linearizations based on structured block kronecker pencils share with block kronecker linearizations properties ( i)(vi ) , listed above , together with the property that they preserve a number of important structures that an odd - degree matrix polynomial might possess .",
    "once a structured matrix polynomial @xmath1 is linearized via a structure - preserving strong linearization @xmath2 , a structured method ( i.e. , a method preserving the spectral symmetries of the spectrum of the polynomial ) can be applied on the pencil @xmath2 to solve the spep or scpe associated with @xmath1 .",
    "there are many available structure - preserving methods for computing the eigenstructure of certain structured matrix pencils .",
    "for example , for regular palindromic or anti - palindromic matrix pencils we have a urv - like method @xcite , a jacobi - like method @xcite , the palindromic - qr algorithm @xcite , doubling methods @xcite , or the qz algorithm with the laub trick @xcite . for singular palindromic or anti - palindromic matrix pencils there is a structured version of the guptri algorithm ( a structured staircase form ) , that deflates the singular part of palindromic pencils @xcite .",
    "all these methods can also be applied to alternating matrix pencils as well , since any alternating pencil can be transformed into a palindromic or anti - palindromic pencil via a cayley transformation @xcite .",
    "methods for other structures can be found in @xcite , for example .",
    "some of the structured methods for structured pencils mentioned in the paragraph above are _",
    "_ structurally global backward stable _ _",
    "@xcite , and others behave in practice in a structurally global backward stable way .",
    "this means that if the complete eigenstructure of a structured matrix polynomial is computed as the complete eigenstructure of a structure - preserving linearization of the matrix polynomial , then the computed complete eigenstructure is the exact one of a nearby matrix pencil with the same structure as the given matrix polynomial .",
    "however , it has been an open problem to determine whether or not these methods compute the exact complete eigenstructure of a structured nearby matrix polynomial .",
    "we only know one reference where this problem is addressed in the case of skew - symmetric matrix polynomials @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the analysis in @xcite is only valid for infinitesimal perturbations and it does not provide precise bounds . only precise `` local '' structured backward error analyses valid for each particular computed eigenvalue or eigenpair have been developed so far .",
    "see , for example , @xcite , or @xcite for the case of the structured linearizations in the vector spaces @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , introduced in @xcite and @xcite .    the main goal of this work is to perform for the first time a rigorous structured global backward error analysis of speps or scpes associated with odd - degree structured matrix polynomials of certain important classes solved by applying a structured algorithm to a structured block kronecker linearization .",
    "the backward error analysis that we present here takes its inspiration from the ( unstructured ) global backward error analysis of peps and cpes solved via block kronecker linearizations performed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 6 ) . as a consequence , our error analysis shares with the analysis in (",
    "* section 6 ) its novel properties with respect to previous global backward error analyses : ( 1 ) it is valid for perturbations with finite norms , ( 2 ) it delivers precise bounds , ( 3 ) it is valid simultaneously for a very large class of structure - preserving linearizations . as a corollary of our results",
    ", we solve the open problem of proving that the famous block - tridiagonal and block - antitridiagonal structure preserving strong linearizations presented in @xcite yield computed complete eigenstructures of structured matrix polynomials that enjoy perfect structured backward stability from the polynomial point of view .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : basics ] , we review some basic concepts and results , and summarize the notation used through the paper . in section [ sec : mobius ] , we recall mbius transformations of matrix polynomials and their relation with structured matrix polynomials .",

    "first , notice that we may write the matrix @xmath345 as @xmath474\\\\       = &      \\left [        \\begin{array}{c|c }          ( bf_{kn}-de_{kn})\\otimes i_k & -i_{kn}\\otimes e_{k}\\\\\\hline           ( af_{kn}-ce_{kn})\\otimes i_{k}&i_{kn}\\otimes f_{k }        \\end{array }      \\right]\\otimes i_{n}=:\\widetilde{t}_a\\otimes i_{n}.      \\end{split }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , we obtain @xmath475 .",
    "then , we perform a perfect shuffle permutation on each block of the matrix @xmath476 to swap the order of the kronecker products . in other words , there exist permutation matrices @xmath477 , @xmath478 , and @xmath479 ( see , for example , @xcite ) such that @xmath480      \\left [ \\begin{array}{c|c }          ( bf_{kn}-de_{kn})\\otimes i_k & -i_{kn}\\otimes e_{k}\\\\\\hline           ( af_{kn}-ce_{kn})\\otimes i_{k}&i_{kn}\\otimes f_{k }        \\end{array }      \\right ]      \\left [        \\begin{array}{c|c }          r_1^{t}&\\\\\\hline         \\phantom{\\big { ( } } &   r_2^{t }        \\end{array }      \\right]\\\\      = &   \\left [ \\begin{array}{c|c }          i_k\\otimes ( bf_{kn}-de_{kn } ) & -e_{k}\\otimes i_{kn}\\\\\\hline           i_{k}\\otimes ( af_{kn}-ce_{kn } ) & f_{k}\\otimes i_{kn }        \\end{array }      \\right ] \\\\",

    "we will denote by @xmath482 the matrix @xmath473 when @xmath483 , for @xmath484 .",
    "the rest of the proof consists in showing that the minimum singular value of the matrix @xmath485 , for @xmath484 , is equal to the minimum singular value of the matrix @xmath486 which , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas 6.4 and b.1 ) , is equal to @xmath487 .",
    "first , notice the following equalities @xmath488   \\\\ = & \\begin{bmatrix } -i_{k^2 } & 0 \\\\ 0 & i_{k^2 } \\end{bmatrix } \\left [ \\begin{array}{c|c } i_k\\otimes e_k & -e_k \\otimes i_k \\\\",

    "let us compute first the minimum singular value of @xmath495 .",
    "recall that the singular values of @xmath495 are equal to the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath496 .",
    "the matrix @xmath496 is equal to @xmath497 where @xmath498 .",
    "it is well known that the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath499 are @xmath500 , where @xmath501 are the singular values of @xmath502 .",
    "therefore , the eigenvalues of @xmath503 are @xmath504 , which implies @xmath505 so we have to compute the largest singular value of the matrix @xmath502 . to this aim ,",
    "let us denote by @xmath506 the @xmath507 reverse identity matrix , i.e. , the matrix @xmath508 notice @xmath509 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath510 . from (",

    "<S> finally , for the classes of ( skew-)symmetric , ( anti-)palindromic , and alternating odd - degree matrix polynomials , the @xmath0-structured framework allows us to perform a global and structured backward stability analysis of complete structured polynomial eigenproblems , regular or singular , solved by applying to a @xmath0-structured block kronecker pencil a structurally backward stable algorithm that computes its complete eigenstructure , like the palindromic - qr algorithm or the structured versions of the staircase algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis allows us to identify those @xmath0-structured block kronecker pencils that yield a computed complete eigenstructure which is the exact one of a slightly perturbed structured matrix polynomial . </S>",
    "<S> these pencils include ( modulo permutations ) the well - known block - tridiagonal and block - antitridiagonal structure - preserving linearizations . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis incorporates structure to the recent ( unstructured ) backward error analysis performed for block kronecker linearizations by dopico , lawrence , prez and van dooren , and share with it its key features , namely , it is a rigorous analysis valid for finite perturbations , i.e. , it is not a first order analysis , it provides precise bounds , and it is valid simultaneously for a large class of structure - preserving strong linearizations .    </S>",
