    "the problem of quantifying the uncertainty of the solution of systems of partial or ordinary differential equations has become in recent years a rather active area of research .",
    "the realization that more often than not , for problems of practical interest , one is not able to determine the parameters , initial conditions , boundary conditions etc . to within high enough accuracy , has led to a flourishing literature of methods for quantifying the impact that this uncertainty imposes on the solution of the problems under investigation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . however , despite the increase in computational power and the development of various techniques for uncertainty quantification there is still a wealth of problems where reliable uncertainty quantification is beyond reach .",
    "the main reason behind the inadequacy is the often high dimensionality ( in probability space ) of the uncertainty sources . when this uncertainty is coupled with the fact that for practical problems , even solving the corresponding equations for one value of the uncertain parameter ( initial condition , boundary condition , @xmath0 ) can be very expensive , it results in the uncertainty quantification problem being a rather formidable task .",
    "one way to address this problem is to look for reduced models for a subset of the variables needed for a complete description of the uncertainty .",
    "we begin by noting that not all sources of uncertainty are created equal .",
    "for example , as we are taught from the theory of ordinary and partial differential equations , the effect of uncertainty in the initial conditions is different from the effect of a parametric uncertainty ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the effect of all types of uncertainty is intimately connected with the inherent instabilities that may be present in the underlying system which we subject to the uncertainty .",
    "these considerations remain equally , if not more , important when we attempt to construct reduced models for uncertainty quantification .    in the current work ,",
    "we are concerned with the construction of reduced models for systems of differential equations that arise from polynomial chaos expansions of solutions of a pde or ode system .",
    "in particular , we focus on the case that the given pde or ode system contains some uncertain parameter and we want to construct a reduced model for the evolution of a subset of the polynomial chaos expansions that are needed for a complete description of the uncertainty caused by the uncertain parameters",
    ". there are different methods to construct reduced models for pde or ode systems ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we choose to use the mori - zwanzig ( mz ) formalism in order to construct the reduced model @xcite .",
    "the main issue with all model reduction approaches is the computation of the memory caused by the process of eliminating variables from the given system ( referred to as the full system from this point on ) @xcite .",
    "the memory terms are , in general , integral terms which account for the history of the variables that are not resolved .",
    "one would like , if possible , to compute these memory integrals _ without _ having to solve the full system .",
    "this is a difficult task , since it is rarely clear how the memory of a reduced model ( which is based on the dynamics of the unresolved variables ) can be estimated from pure analytical considerations or even relatively cheap numerical calculations involving only the resolved variables .",
    "on the other hand , for problems of practical interest where the solution of the full system may be , at best , only feasible for short times , we are forced to consider ways of estimating the memory terms from such analytical or lower dimensional considerations .",
    "we use the case of the viscous burgers equation with uncertain viscosity coefficient to illustrate how it is possible to estimate the parameters needed to specify the memory terms .",
    "the basic idea is that the uncertainty in the viscosity coefficient leads to linear and nonlinear contributions in the memory terms .",
    "one can group the linear contributions from the different memory terms and then require that this linear term is a stabilizing one .",
    "this procedure allows to estimate recursively ( as we increase the order of the terms kept in the reduced model ) the parameters involved in the memory integrals .",
    "section [ mz_formalism ] presents a brief introduction to the mz formalism for the construction of reduced models of systems of odes . in section [ memory_comp ]",
    "we develop a reformulation of the mz formalism .",
    "this allows the calculation of the memory terms through the solution of ordinary differential equations instead of the computation of convolution integrals as they appear in the original formulation .",
    "section [ example ] applies the reformulation of mz presented in section [ memory_comp ] to the viscous burgers equation when the viscosity coefficient is uncertain .",
    "finally , in section [ discussion ] we discuss certain directions for future work .",
    "we begin with a brief presentation of the mori - zwanzig formalism @xcite .",
    "suppose we are given the system @xmath1 where @xmath2 with initial condition @xmath3 our goal is to construct a reduced model for the modes in the subset @xmath4 the system of ordinary differential equations we are given can be transformed into a system of linear partial differential equations @xmath5 where @xmath6 the solution of is given by @xmath7 .",
    "using semigroup notation we can rewrite ( [ pde ] ) as @xmath8 suppose that the vector of initial conditions can be divided as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the vector of the resolved variables ( those in @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 is the vector of the unresolved variables ( those in @xmath13 ) .",
    "let @xmath14 be an orthogonal projection on the space of functions of @xmath10 and @xmath15    equation can be rewritten as @xmath16 where we have used dyson s formula @xmath17 equation ( [ mz ] ) is the mori - zwanzig identity .",
    "note that this relation is exact and is an alternative way of writing the original pde .",
    "it is the starting point of our approximations .",
    "of course , we have one such equation for each of the resolved variables @xmath18 . the first term in ( [ mz ] )",
    "is usually called markovian since it depends only on the values of the variables at the current instant , the second is called `` noise '' and the third `` memory '' .",
    "if we write @xmath19 @xmath20 satisfies the equation @xmath21 if we project ( [ ortho ] ) we get @xmath22 since @xmath23 . also for the initial condition @xmath24 by the same argument .",
    "thus , the solution of ( [ ortho ] ) is at all times orthogonal to the range of @xmath25 we call ( [ ortho ] ) the orthogonal dynamics equation .",
    "since the solutions of the orthogonal dynamics equation remain orthogonal to the range of @xmath14 , we can project the mori - zwanzig equation ( [ mz ] ) and find @xmath26",
    "in this section we describe a reformulation of the problem of computing the memory term which does not use the orthogonal dynamics equation .",
    "we focus on the case when the memory has a finite extent only .",
    "the case of infinite memory is simpler and is a special case of the formulation presented below .",
    "also , the current reformulation allows us to comment on what happens in the case when the memory is very short .",
    "let @xmath27 by the change of variables @xmath28 note , that @xmath29 depends both on @xmath30 and the resolved part of the initial conditions @xmath31 we have suppressed the @xmath10 dependence for simplicity of notation .",
    "if the memory extends only for @xmath32 units in the past ( with @xmath33 ) then @xmath34 the evolution of @xmath29 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 to allow for more flexibility , let us assume that the integrand in the formula for @xmath37 contributes only for @xmath38 units with @xmath39 then @xmath40 we can proceed and write an equation for the evolution of @xmath37 which reads @xmath41 where @xmath42 similarly , if this integral extends only for @xmath43 units in the past with @xmath44 then @xmath45 this hierarchy of equations continues indefinitely .",
    "also , we can assume for more flexibility that at every level of the hierarchy we allow the interval of integration for the integral term to extend to fewer or the same units of time than the integral in the previous level .",
    "if we keep , say , @xmath46 terms in this hierarchy , the equation for @xmath47 will read @xmath48 where @xmath49 note that the last term in involves the unknown evolution operator for the orthogonal dynamics equation .",
    "this situation is the well - known closure problem .",
    "we can stop the hierarchy at the @xmath46th term by assuming that @xmath50    in addition to the closure problem , the unknown evolution operator for the orthogonal dynamics equation appears in the equations for the evolution of @xmath51 through the terms @xmath52 @xmath53 respectively .",
    "we describe now a way to express these terms involving the unknown orthogonal dynamics operator through known quantities so that we obtain a closed system for the evolution of @xmath54    since we want to treat the case where @xmath32 is not necessarily small , we divide the interval @xmath55 $ ] in @xmath56 subintervals .",

    "in this section we show how the above mz formulation can be used for uncertainty quantification ( uq ) . in particular , we apply it to the one - dimensional burgers equation when the viscosity coefficient is uncertain .",
    "the equation is given by @xmath81 where @xmath82 equation ( [ burgersequation ] ) should be supplemented with an initial condition @xmath83 and boundary conditions .",

    "the legendre polynomial triple product integral defines a tensor which has the following sparsity pattern : @xmath114=0,$ ] if @xmath115 or @xmath116 or @xmath117 or @xmath118 @xcite . due to this sparsity pattern , for a given value of @xmath102 only about @xmath119 of the @xmath120 tensor entries are different from zero .",
    "the sparsity pattern will be used below ( see section [ mz_memory ] ) to facilitate the estimation of the length of the memory .      to conform with the mori - zwanzig formalism we set @xmath121 where @xmath122 for @xmath97 and @xmath109 thus , we have @xmath123 for @xmath97 and @xmath109 we proceed by dividing the variables in resolved and unresolved .",
    "in particular , we consider as resolved the variables @xmath124 for @xmath97 and @xmath125 where @xmath126 similarly , the unresolved variables are @xmath127 for @xmath97 and @xmath128 in the notation of section [ mz_formalism ] we have @xmath129 and @xmath130 in other words , we resolve , for all the fourier modes , only the first @xmath131 of the legendre expansion coefficients and we shall construct a reduced model for them .",
    "the system ( [ burgersodemz ] ) is supplemented by the initial condition @xmath132 we focus on initial conditions where the unresolved fourier modes are set to zero , i.e. @xmath133 we also define @xmath134 by @xmath135 to construct a mz reduced model we need to define a projection operator @xmath25 for a function @xmath136 of all the variables , the projection operator we will use is defined by @xmath137 i.e. it replaces the value of the unresolved variables @xmath12 in any function @xmath136 by zero .",
    "note that this choice of projection is consistent with the initial conditions we have chosen .",
    "also , we define the markovian term @xmath138 the markovian term has the same functional form as the rhs of the full system but is restricted to a sum over only the first @xmath131 legendre expansion coefficients for each fourier mode .",
    "we have to decide on the number of terms that will be used in the expansion of the memory as well as the length of the memory kept for each term ( see section [ memory_comp ] ) .",
    "the fact that we are considering the case of uncertain viscosity coefficient becomes important in choosing how many terms to keep in the memory expansion and what the memory length should be for each term . to see this",
    "we need to compute the first few terms in the expansion . for the first two terms @xmath139 and @xmath140",

    "the conclusion from this pattern is that one needs to keep the memory terms in pairs in order to guarantee the stability of the reduced model .",
    "also , since these contributions correspond to higher and higher spatial derivatives in real space we have to use only a few pairs otherwise the reduced model will become extremely stiff . in our numerical experiments",
    "we have used only the first pair of memory terms , namely @xmath144 and @xmath145      we will use the information obtained in section [ mz_number ] to estimate the length of the memory .",
    "ideally , we would like to estimate the values of @xmath32 and @xmath38 _ without _ having to solve the full system .",
    "that would make the construction of the reduced model efficient and applicable in cases where the solution of the full system is expensive ( or possibly unknown ) .",
    "we focus again on the case when @xmath155 and we assume that we use only one subinterval to discretize the time integrals , i.e. @xmath156 and @xmath157 if we keep only the terms @xmath144 and @xmath148 for the memory , the reduced model reads    @xmath158    we can solve and formally and substitute in to get @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161    the quantities @xmath162 and @xmath163 have on the rhs of their equations of evolution the terms @xmath164 and @xmath165 respectively .",
    "as we have seen , the linear contributions of the viscous term to @xmath144 and @xmath148 correspond to higher spatial derivatives . due to the presence of @xmath166 and @xmath167 in the linear terms in the expressions for @xmath144 and @xmath148 respectively",
    ", those linear terms are going to have large value for large wavenumbers .",
    "at the same time , these linear terms are linear in @xmath168 which is expected to evolve more slowly .",
    "thus , the linear terms in the expressions for @xmath144 and @xmath148 are expected to have ( at least for large wavenumbers ) large values and evolve slowly . as a result",
    ", we expect the quantities @xmath162 and @xmath163 to evolve faster than @xmath169 with this in mind , we expect the memory lengths @xmath32 and @xmath38 to be shorter compared to the time scale of evolution of @xmath169 the crudest approximation that one can make for the integrals in are @xmath170 and @xmath171 these approximations for the integrals allow us to group together all the linear terms on the rhs of the equation for @xmath169 indeed , putting together the linear contributions from the markovian term and the two integral terms ( after the approximation ) we get the linear term @xmath172 u_{k0}(t).\\ ] ] the expression in brackets in can be used to determine what should the values of @xmath32 and @xmath38 be so that the reduced model is linearly stable for all wave numbers @xmath173    the calculation of @xmath32 and @xmath38 is done in two steps . if we ignore the @xmath166 and @xmath174 terms , then the only contribution is from the markovian term and the bracketed expression is a parabola in @xmath101 with negative values .",
    "if we also include the @xmath166 term the parabola changes into a double - well curve which can become greater than zero for some wave numbers depending on the value of @xmath175 in fact , we can estimate the minimum value of @xmath32 for this to happen by solving the equation @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the maximum wavenumber present in the solution .",
    "in fact , @xmath178 for @xmath179 all the wavenumbers are linearly stable except for the wavenumber @xmath177 which is only marginally stable .    now",
    ", suppose that we set @xmath32 equal to @xmath179 and we also include the @xmath174 term .",
    "then , the bracketed expression in becomes a 6th order negative curve .",
    "the addition of the negative definite @xmath174 term provides us with an advantage .",
    "it allows us to increase @xmath32 to values larger than @xmath179 as long as @xmath38 is appropriately chosen to make sure that the all the wavenumbers are linearly stable .",
    "of course , one should not increase @xmath32 too much because a correspondingly large value of @xmath38 in conjunction with the @xmath174 factor can render the reduced model very stiff .",
    "thus , the final criterion which allows us to determine @xmath32 and @xmath38 uniquely is that , based on the linear stability domain of the numerical method , we pick @xmath32 and @xmath38 so that the required step size for the reduced model is not smaller than the step size for the original ( full ) system .      in this section",
    "we present numerical results for the reduced model of the viscous burgers equation with uncertain viscosity coefficient given by @xmath104 with @xmath93 and @xmath180 the solution of the full system was computed with @xmath181 fourier modes ( @xmath182 $ ] ) and the first 7 legendre polynomials ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the first 7 legendre polynomials were enough to obtain converged statistics for the full system .",
    "the full system was solved with the modified euler method with @xmath184    the reduced model uses @xmath181 fourier modes but only the first legendre polynomial , so @xmath185 the memory length parameters in the reduced model were chosen to be @xmath186 and @xmath187 according to the scheme presented in section [ mz_length ] .",
    "in particular , this choice of memory length guarantees linear stability of the reduced model when it is solved with the modified euler method with a step size of @xmath188 we discretize the memory integral with 1 subinterval , i.e. @xmath189 @xmath190 and @xmath191 according to the notation of section [ memory_comp ] . with this choice of parameters the running time of the reduced model is about half of that of the full system .",
    "note that according to our analysis in section [ memory_comp ] there is a discrepancy in the local truncation error estimates of the trapezoidal rule and the modified euler scheme . for",
    "the trapezoidal rule the local truncation error estimate is @xmath192 for the memory term @xmath29 and @xmath193 for the memory term @xmath194 on the other hand , the local truncation error estimate for the modified euler method is @xmath195 to make the discrepancy disappear we must use more subintervals at the cost of making the reduced model evolution more expensive .",
    "we tried that but the accuracy of the results of the reduced model did not change .",
    "figure [ plot_viscosity_energy ] shows the evolution of the mean energy of the solution @xmath196 as computed from the full system ( with @xmath183 legendre polynomials ) , the mz reduced model with @xmath155 _ without _ memory ( keeping only the markovian term ) and the mz reduced model with @xmath155 _ with _ memory .",
    "the reduced model performs equally well with or without memory .",
    "figure [ plot_viscosity_gradient ] shows the evolution of the mean squared @xmath197 norm of the gradient of the solution @xmath198 as computed from the full system ( with @xmath183 legendre polynomials ) , the mz reduced model with @xmath155 _ without _ memory ( keeping only the markovian term ) and the mz reduced model with @xmath155 _ with _ memory .",
    "it is obvious from the figures that the inclusion of the memory term improves considerably the performance of the reduced model .    by looking at figure [ plot_viscosity_gradient ]",
    ", we see that the reduced model with memory predicts a smaller value for the peak of @xmath199 we know that the term @xmath144 contributes a linear destabilizing term to the reduced model ( see ) .",
    "so , the obvious question to ask is if one can improve the accuracy of the reduced model with memory by increasing @xmath32 and correspondingly @xmath38 at the cost of making the evolution of the reduced model more expensive .",
    "as explained in section [ mz_length ] , the increase in the cost will come from the increased stiffness of the reduced model .",
    "we have tried increasing @xmath32 and @xmath38 and the results did not become more accurate .",
    "the reason for this lack of improvement is a sign that if one wishes to improve the accuracy of the reduced model , one needs to include higher order terms .",
    "in particular , one will have to add at least the next pair of terms , namely @xmath151 and @xmath200 ( see discussion at the end of section [ mz_number ] as to why the terms need to be added in pairs ) .",
    "we have presented the application of the mori - zwanzig formalism to the construction of reduced models for systems of differential equations resulting from polynomial chaos expansions of solutions of differential equations with parametric uncertainty . in particular",
    ", we presented a way that the reduced model can be reformulated so that instead of integro - differential equations one has to solve differential equations .",
    "the problem that arises in any reduced model with memory is to compute the length of the memory .",
    "if possible , one wishes to obtain the length of the memory without having to solve the full system . for the case of the viscous burgers equation with uncertain viscosity coefficient",
    ", we presented a way to actually compute the length of the memory without having to solve the full system .",
    "note that this construction readily applies also to other equations that include viscous dissipation e.g. the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the viscous burgers example highlights two important issues that arise when one wants to construct reduced models for parametric uncertainty quantification .",
    "the first issue is how to estimate the length of the memory integrals when we keep in the reduced model more than one coefficient in the legendre expansion , so that @xmath201 in this case , the bracketed expression in will be replaced by a @xmath202 matrix . in order for the reduced model to be linearly stable",
    ", we have to require that the matrix is negative definite ( or at least semidefinite ) .",
    "since the elements of the matrix depend on the quantities @xmath203 we can use the negative definite restriction to estimate @xmath204    the second issue is also related to the length of the memory but addresses a different aspect .",
    "we have seen for viscous burgers that because the memory terms correspond to higher derivatives in physical space , the lengths of the integrals for the different memory terms ( in our example @xmath32 and @xmath38 ) _ decrease _ as the order of the memory term increases .",
    "this allowed us to use a crude short - memory approximation of the memory integral ( see section [ mz_length ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there are cases when the length of the integrals for the different memory terms can _ increase _ as the order of the memory term increases . in such cases",
    "the short - memory approximation of the memory integrals will not work .",
    "a simple example which illustrates this behavior is that of a single decaying linear ode @xmath205 where @xmath206.$ ] if one applies the procedure outlined in sections [ memory_comp ] and [ trapezoidal ] , it is easy to see that the terms @xmath207 decrease in amplitude and thus the required memory integrals lengths @xmath208 increase as we go to higher order terms .",
    "a crude approximation is to assume that all the memory kernels in ( and for higher order terms ) have the same decaying characteristic times , that is @xmath209 preliminary numerical calculations show that as we increase the order of the memory terms kept in the reduced model we also have to _ increase _ the value of @xmath32 in order to increase the accuracy .",
    "a detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "when the uncertainty is due not to a parameter in the equations but due to the initial conditions , the criterion presented in section [ mz_length ] for selecting the length of the memory will not work .",
    "for example , in the viscous burgers equation , where the viscous term is diagonal in fourier space , if the viscosity has no uncertainty , the projection operator makes the viscous term part of the markovian term . as a result",
    ", the viscous term will end up contributing in the memory terms but the corresponding contribution is a term which is _ nonlinear _ in the resolved variables .",
    "thus , even if one groups the memory contributions from the viscous term , there is no simple linear stability criterion , like the one invoked in the current work , to facilitate the estimation of the memory length .",
    "the construction of reduced models for the case of uncertain initial conditions will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "such a construction can also be applied to the problem of constructing reduced models for systems forced by random noise @xcite .    finally , we mention that one can construct models which effect reduction both for the variables needed to describe uncertainty and the number of variables needed to describe the system for one realization of the uncertainty sources .",
    "this two - level reduction is imperative in situations where solving even for one realization of the uncertainty sources is very expensive e.g. atmospheric flows , fluid structure interactions .",

    "<S> in many time - dependent problems of practical interest the parameters entering the equations describing the evolution of the various quantities exhibit uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> one way to address the problem of how this uncertainty impacts the solution is to expand the solution using polynomial chaos expansions and obtain a system of differential equations for the evolution of the expansion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we present an application of the mori - zwanzig formalism to the problem of constructing reduced models of such systems of differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we construct reduced models for a subset of the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients that are needed for a full description of the uncertainty caused by the uncertain parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the viscous burgers equation with uncertain viscosity parameter is used to illustrate the construction . for this example we provide a way to estimate the necessary parameters that appear in the reduced model _ without _ having to solve the full system . </S>"
