    "the explicit computation of loop amplitudes in string theory is notoriously difficult . even for the technically most simple theory  the bosonic string ",
    "the level of mathematical complexity is impressing if one tries to go beyond one loop .",
    "adding fermions and supersymmetry on the world - sheet does not improve the situation . on the contrary ,",
    "the calculations become still more intricate and only a few explicit results exist .",
    "it seems that even the general formalism has not yet been fully worked out @xcite .",
    "fortunately , explicit computations can sometimes be replaced by more indirect methods , often related to symmetry arguments .",
    "it is thus not surprising that for the @xmath0 string ( i.e. the theory based on extended supersymmetry on the world - sheet ; see @xcite for a general review and @xcite for a discussion of loop amplitudes ) berkovits and vafa succeeded to avoid the evaluation of the path integral and obtained powerful results for loop amplitudes by embedding the theory into an @xmath1 topological theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , they found that all amplitudes with more than three external legs vanish to all orders in the loop expansion .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to give an alternative derivation of this result .",
    "our approach has the advantage that conceptually it is very clear what is going on since the equations used to derive the vanishing of the amplitudes can nicely be interpreted as ward identities of an infinite set of unbroken symmetries in target space .",
    "another interesting point is that from a technical point of view our analysis rests on the picture dependence of the brst cohomology of the @xmath0 string at zero momentum and demonstrates what kind of information may be stored in the still somewhat obscure picture phenomenon @xcite .",
    "maybe , this lesson can also be useful in some way for the @xmath2 string .",
    "the letter is organised as follows : in the next section we recall some facts about the brst cohomology of the @xmath0 string .",
    "these results will be used in section three to derive an infinite set of target space ward identities which will then be explicitly evaluated so that the vanishing of the loop amplitudes directly follows .",
    "we conclude with some further remarks and a brief discussion of the reliability of our arguments .",
    "one of the attractive features of the brst approach to closed string theory is that it provides an efficient means to analyse symmetries in target space .",
    "more precisely , unbroken target space symmetries generally lead to the existence of ghost number one cohomology classes ( in conventions where physical states have ghost number two ) .",
    "a detailed explanation of this fact is given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where in addition an elegant method to derive the corresponding ward identities  briefly reviewed below  is described .    due to the fact that the closed string fock space factorises into right- and left - moving parts ghost number one cohomology classes can be further characterised : they are most conveniently constructed as a product of a holomorphic piece of ghost number zero and an antiholomorphic piece of ghost number one .",
    "the latter is usually the right - moving part of a physical vertex operator , taken at some discrete value of the momentum whereas the former very often is just the unit operator .",
    "if , however , the chiral (= left - moving ) cohomology at ghost number zero contains further elements besides the unit operator more closed string operators of ghost number one can be constructed resulting in a much richer symmetry structure .",
    "an example is the bosonic string in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "moreover , interesting algebraic structures emerge .",
    "the brst cohomology possesses a natural multiplication rule , additive in ghost number .",
    "the ghost number zero cohomology therefore forms a ring under this multiplication ( the so - called ground ring ) .",
    "as has been emphasised in @xcite the structure constants of this ground ring encode much information about the symmetry of the theory operation ",
    "which , together with the ring multiplication , give the brst cohomology the structure of a bv - algebra @xcite . ] .",
    "the @xmath0 string has been studied along these lines in @xcite .",
    "based on the fact that so many of its scattering amplitudes are known or conjectured to vanish @xcite and comparison with the field theory that reproduces tree - level scattering @xcite it seemed very plausible that in this theory a large symmetry group is realized .",
    "in fact , a ground ring of the @xmath0 string has recently been found in @xcite and will now briefly be reviewed .",
    "the construction looks somewhat unconventional because it does not restrict to operators of a single picture only , but takes into account the full picture degeneracy of the fock space string at zero momentum @xcite . ] .",
    "however , starting from this ground ring one may derive powerful ward identities as has been shown for tree amplitudes in @xcite and will be demonstrated in this letter for loop amplitudes .    at zero ghost number",
    "chiral cohomology classes occur only for vanishing momentum . for low - lying picture numbers and ghost number zero",
    "the cohomology problem is rather straightforward to solve and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cohomologies for pictures @xmath4 with @xmath5 coincide due to spectral flow .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to consider the case @xmath6 only . ] :    * the cohomology is empty for pictures @xmath7 and consists of the unit operator in the @xmath8 picture .",
    "* in the pictures @xmath9 and @xmath10 the cohomology consists of the spectral flow operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( see @xcite for conventions and a description of the @xmath0 string ghost system ) . one may check that @xmath15 and @xmath16 are inverse to each other with respect to ring multiplication . * in the @xmath17 picture the cohomology consists of the picture changing operator @xmath18 _ and _ the operator @xmath19 it should be emphasised that @xmath20 is brst inequivalent to @xmath21 .",
    "analogously , the @xmath22 cohomology consists of the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "we see that the size of the cohomology grows as the picture increases . to obtain cohomology classes with higher integral picture numbers",
    "one may simply consider polynomials of the operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 note that @xmath27 and @xmath28 must not be negative since , contrary to @xmath2 strings , there do not exist local inverse picture changing operators for the @xmath0 string @xcite ( the cohomology at vanishing momentum and ghost number is empty for picture numbers @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that all these operators are _ brst inequivalent _ ! for a given picture @xmath31 we thus have constructed @xmath32 operators , @xmath33 to obtain ghost number one cohomology classes of the closed string connected to the symmetries of the theory the operators in ( [ coh ] ) have to be combined with right - moving cohomology classes of zero momentum and ghost number one .",
    "these operators can be found in a similar way : in @xcite it has been shown that the relevant cohomology in the @xmath8 picture is spanned by the four elements @xmath34 here the target space lorentz indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "multiplication with @xmath39 gives similar operators in higher pictures : @xmath40 we are now ready to write down the sought for closed string cohomology classes of ghost number one : @xmath41 to save space the analogous operators @xmath42 will not be explicitly mentioned in the following .",
    "using the descent equations one may now construct an infinite set of symmetry charges and work out the transformation laws of the physical state .",
    "this has been done in @xcite .",
    "we conclude this section with one further remark .",
    "so far , we have only considered the relative cohomology of states that are annihilated by the zero modes of all fermionic antighosts .",
    "it would , however , be more appropriate also to take into account states that are not annihilated by @xmath43 which defines the so - called semi - relative cohomology ( one way to see that this is the right space to consider is to write down a kinetic term in a string field formalism ) .",
    "allowing for more states generally changes the cohomology .",
    "but fortunately , one can show that the operators ( [ coh2 ] ) are still non - trivial in the semi - relative cohomology .",
    "one may also wonder whether new cohomology classes turn up , as happens for the bosonic string in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "we do not know the general answer to this question , but explicit calculations for low - lying pictures indicate that this is not the case .",
    "we will now use the results from the previous section to derive ward identities for @xmath0 string amplitudes at arbitrary genus .",
    "actually , an @xmath0 string scattering amplitude is further characterised by a chern number classifying @xmath44 bundles over the world - sheet riemann surface .",
    "it is , however , sufficient to focus on vanishing chern number in the following .",
    "this will be justified in section four . for reasons of space the general formalism",
    "will not be reviewed in detail here .",
    "instead , we refer to @xcite for more extensive explanations .",
    "the basic object involved in the computation of scattering amplitudes is the vertex operator of the single degree of freedom in the theory . as usual ,",
    "it splits into holomorphic and antiholomorphic parts : @xmath45 the left - moving operator is @xmath46 in the @xmath47 picture and @xmath48 in higher pictures ( the right - moving piece @xmath49 looks similar ) . counting both metric and @xmath44 but not supersymmetry ghost number vertex operators in closed @xmath0 string theory therefore",
    "have ghost number four ( in our conventions picture changing operators have ghost number zero , see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , they are not annihilated by the zero modes @xmath50 and @xmath51 of the @xmath44 antighosts . on the other hand",
    "the ghost number one operators constructed in the previous section are all elements of the relative cohomology , i.e. they are all killed by the zero modes of all fermionic antighosts .",
    "it is , however , not too difficult to relate relative cohomology classes to operators of higher ghost number , essentially by multiplying with the relevant ghosts . in this way we can construct from the ghost number one operators in equation ( [ coh2 ] ) new cohomology classes of ghost number three : @xmath52 here the dots refer to further terms that might be necessary to achieve brst invariance but are unimportant otherwise .",
    "we are now ready to derive a ward identity involving a genus @xmath53 scattering amplitude of @xmath54 external states with momenta @xmath55 ( denoted @xmath56 in the following ) .",
    "one starts with the correlator @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the the appropriate beltrami differentials integrated with the corresponding antighosts and the index @xmath53 indicates that the correlator is meant to be evaluated with respect to the conformal field theory living on a riemann surface of genus @xmath53 .",
    "the antighosts can be applied to the vertex operators and the integrations can be pulled out of the brackets .",
    "let us denote the remaining integrand by @xmath60 .",
    "if the operator @xmath61 in ( [ corr ] ) were replaced by an ordinary physical vertex operator @xmath62 one could integrate @xmath60 over the moduli space of a genus @xmath53 surface with @xmath63 punctures . from counting dimensions and ghost numbers it follows , however ,",
    "that @xmath60 as defined by ( [ corr ] ) can be integrated only over the boundary of moduli space .",
    "in fact , it can be considered as a differential form on moduli space of codimension one . since",
    "@xmath60 can also be shown to be a closed form @xcite stokes theorem leads to the desired ward identity @xmath64 the next step is to have a closer look at the @xmath0 string moduli space @xmath65 , i.e. the moduli space of @xmath0 super riemann surfaces with genus @xmath53 and @xmath63 punctures ( and vanishing chern number in our case ) .",
    "in addition to the usual metric and super moduli , we also have to consider the so - called @xmath44 moduli @xcite describing a continuum of possible monodromy phases for the world - sheet fermions arising from their transport along non - trivial homology cycles .",
    "however , the @xmath44 moduli space is compact ( it always has the topology of a torus ) and therefore does not contribute to the boundary of moduli space . as a result , in our ward identity ( [ wi ] ) only the familiar boundary components of the metric moduli space appear .",
    "the metric moduli are of two different types .",
    "one corresponds to the shape of the underlying riemann surface whereas the other describes punctures , i.e. the locations of the vertex operators .",
    "if we move to the boundary of moduli space the riemann surface degenerates in some way . in the following it",
    "is convenient to distinguish four different cases : first of all , the underlying surface may pinch either along a trivial or a non - trivial homology cycle .",
    "if a genus @xmath53 surface pinches along a non - trivial cycle it becomes a surface of genus @xmath66 with two points coinciding .",
    "if it pinches along a trivial cycle the result is a connected pair of riemann surfaces with genera @xmath67 and @xmath68 such that @xmath69 . for a @xmath70 surface with four punctures",
    "these two cases are illustrated in the top row of the figure below .",
    "it may also happen that a number of punctures approach each other .",
    "this is conformally equivalent to a situation where a sphere containing the relevant punctures splits off of the rest of the surface .",
    "this is illustrated in the bottom line of the figure , where we also distinguished whether two vertex operators @xmath62 approach each other or one @xmath62 approaches the ghost number three operator @xmath61 .    to see how a pinch ( denoted by @xmath71 in the figure ) can properly be included in the computation",
    "let us recall that it can equivalently be described by an infinitely long cylinder .",
    "this cylinder can be taken into account by inserting a complete set of physical states . in this formulation",
    "the twist angle of the cylinder is one of the moduli leading to an insertion of the metric antighost combination @xmath72 .",
    "so the pinch can be represented by the sum @xmath73 where @xmath74 labels a basis of the absolute brst cohomology and @xmath75 what about the fermionic and @xmath44 moduli ?",
    "the former are correctly taken into account by obeying the right selection rules for picture numbers @xcite . moreover",
    ", a pinch contributes one complex @xmath44 modulus .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the complete set of states ( [ csos ] ) carries two units of @xmath44 ghost number ",
    "just enough to compensate the antighost insertion due to the @xmath44 modulus of the pinch .",
    "let us now become more explicit : we assume @xmath76 , i.e. the presence of at least three vertex operators , and genus @xmath77 since tree - level amplitudes have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it will also be sufficient and technically simpler to consider only operators @xmath78 ( and the corresponding @xmath61 ) of the form @xmath79 which have picture numbers @xmath80 .",
    "the four cases mentioned above will now be discussed in turn .      besides the @xmath54 physical vertex operators already present the pinching leads to an insertion of two further vertex operators @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as explained above .",
    "so we have to evaluate the expression @xmath83 here , the notation for the vertex operators has been simplified in a hopefully obvious way .",
    "the double bracket as usual denotes evaluation of the full amplitude including integration over moduli space .    to further evaluate the expression ( [ c1 ] )",
    "let us note that it contains at least six operators ( since we assumed @xmath84 in the beginning ) .",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath53 integration over moduli space leads for this number of operators to insertions of metric antighosts that transform cohomology classes into integrated vertex operators .",
    "since this effect will be crucial in the following , we briefly review some details : + assume the operator @xmath85 represents a closed string cohomology class . from the explicit form of the brst operator it follows that @xmath86 satisfies the relation @xmath87 = \\partial { \\cal b},\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath88 being the left - moving part of the brst operator .",
    "since this argument goes through for the right - moving half , as well , a @xmath89-ghost insertion leads to the integrated operator @xmath90 which is brst invariant since the integrand transforms into a total derivative . in practice ,",
    "going over from a cohomology class to an integrated vertex operator simply amounts to getting rid of the undifferentiated @xmath91- and @xmath92-ghosts .",
    "if some cohomology class does not contain both these ghost fields ( as for example the unit operator ) its integrated form is zero .",
    "we are always free to choose where to locate the @xmath89-ghost insertions - ghost insertion is immaterial .",
    "] , i.e. which cohomology class to convert into an integrated operator . in the present case",
    "we can pick @xmath61 . from the explicit form of @xmath15 in equation (",
    "[ a ] ) one sees that stripping off a @xmath91-ghost necessarily leads to the presence of a @xmath93-ghost , for example @xmath94 . however , there is no corresponding @xmath95-ghost in sight to compensate @xmath93 in a correlation function .",
    "so we learn from simple @xmath44 ghost number counting that the amplitude ( [ c1 ] ) vanishes ! in other words , the kind of degeneration considered in this subsection does not contribute to the ward identity .",
    "the contribution to the ward identity of this component of the boundary is @xmath96 with @xmath69 and @xmath97 .",
    "the sum over @xmath98 runs over all possible ways to divide the set of @xmath54 physical vertex operators into a subset @xmath99 on the genus @xmath67 surface and the remainder @xmath100 located on the other surface .",
    "since @xmath67 is strictly positive and the correlation function involving @xmath61 contains at least one further operator the expression ( [ c2 ] ) can again be evaluated by transforming @xmath61 to its integrated form . as in the previous subsection the vanishing of ( [ c2 ] ) then follows from @xmath44 ghost number counting .      in this case",
    "we have to evaluate the expression @xmath101 since @xmath77 by assumption the correlator involving @xmath61 vanishes by the same argument as above .      in this final case the contribution to the ward identity reads @xmath102 the ghost number three operator @xmath61 now appears in a tree - level amplitude whose evaluation involves metric antighost insertions as soon as more than three operators are present .",
    "correspondingly , terms in the @xmath98-sum vanish by the standard argument whenever the @xmath103 correlator involves more than one operator @xmath62 besides @xmath61 and @xmath82 .",
    "what remains are those degenerations where @xmath61 splits off with precisely one vertex operator @xmath62 .",
    "these are the only contributions to the ward identity : @xmath104 obviously , the only non - vanishing term in the above sum over @xmath74 occurs when @xmath81 coincides with the vertex operator @xmath105 . in each term of the @xmath106-sum",
    "the second correlator therefore is just the genus @xmath53 amplitude of @xmath54 physical states @xmath107 .",
    "reinserting the momenta @xmath108 allows us to rewrite the ward identity as @xmath109 these identities have already been derived in @xcite for tree amplitudes .",
    "equations ( [ wi3 ] ) tell us that they do not get modified for higher genera .",
    "the remaining correlator can be evaluated as @xmath110 the final identities for the genus @xmath53 amplitude thus read @xmath111 and imply the vanishing of all amplitudes with @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the three point function , however , is generally non - zero .",
    "one may for example check that the tree - level amplitude @xmath113 satisfies all identities without being zero . on dimensional grounds",
    "it seems very plausible that for higher genus the three point function is just a power of the tree - level result : @xmath114 here the pre - factor @xmath115 depends on the genus but not on the momenta .",
    "explicit computations at one loop show that @xmath116 is divergent @xcite .",
    "this concludes our discussion of the scattering amplitudes of the @xmath0 string .",
    "so far we have ignored the possibility of non - vanishing chern number @xmath91 , corresponding to topologically non - trivial configurations of the @xmath44 gauge field on the world - sheet . a careful evaluation of the path integral shows that a non - zero chern number can be simulated by inserting ( a power of ) the spectral flow operator @xmath15 into the @xmath117 correlation function and simultaneously adjusting the picture numbers of the vertex operators @xcite . since the derivative of the spectral flow operator is brst trivial each @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) can be moved towards one of the vertex operators and simply pulls out a momentum factor @xmath118 ( or its inverse , see eq .",
    "( [ hk ] ) for a definition of @xmath119 ) .",
    "therefore , amplitudes with different chern number are proportional to one another . hence , it is sufficient to prove the vanishing of a scattering amplitude for one fixed value of @xmath91 .",
    "secondly we have ignored that , as a riemann surface with @xmath117 degenerates and splits into two , the resulting surfaces may have non - vanishing chern numbers @xmath91 and @xmath120 .",
    "so we actually should include in our ward identity a summation over all such splittings exceeds a certain value . ] .",
    "however , we have just explained that this only leads to additional factors @xmath121 and @xmath122 which cancel each other ( @xmath27 is the momentum flowing through the pinch ) .",
    "this justifies our treatment where we completely neglected sectors with non - zero chern number .",
    "a further point that deserves to be mentioned is the question of non - linear contributions to the symmetries .",
    "one of the remarkable features of the @xmath0 string that make it such an interesting toy model is the fact that we know a simple field theory that reproduces the tree - level amplitudes to all orders in @xmath123 .",
    "this field theory is well known to possess a highly non - linear symmetry structure . in @xcite the linearised version of the unbroken symmetries on the field theory side",
    "was compared to the transformation rules of the @xmath0 string vertex operators under the symmetries that lead to the above ward identities .",
    "they were found to coincide .",
    "in fact , the hilbert space in our formulation of the theory consists only of single string states .",
    "so it seems at first sight correct to restrict a comparison between symmetries in field theory and string theory to the linear level .",
    "however , it has been explained in @xcite ( section 6 ) that non - linear symmetry structures can make their appearance in a first quantised string theory at the level of ward identities .",
    "more precisely , a non - linear contribution to a ward identity corresponds to a situation where the ghost number one ( three for @xmath0 strings ) operator @xmath61 splits off with more than one further vertex operator .    in this case",
    "only the overlap between the charge acting on a single vertex operator with a multi - string state is sent through the pinch . in other words ,",
    "a symmetry is realized non - linearly precisely when the tree - level amplitude @xmath124 is non - vanishing for @xmath125 .",
    "a model where this indeed happens is the bosonic string in two dimensions .",
    "yet it has been argued in section three that in our case of the @xmath0 string the relevant correlation functions vanish . as a consequence",
    "the ward identity ( [ fwi ] ) is linear .",
    "this indicates a clear discrepancy to the field theory and suggests that the behaviour of the @xmath0 string is not fully captured by its tree - level effective field theory .",
    "last but not least we should give our opinion on the reliability of our arguments .",
    "in fact , we must admit that the analysis of the boundary of the @xmath0 string moduli space has been somewhat heuristic .",
    "it is mainly based on counting of dimensions and ghost numbers .",
    "hidden subtleties might be detected by a more careful investigation .",
    "for example , it is conceivable that the @xmath44 moduli space behaves in some discontinuous way as the riemann surface degenerates . whether or not this is the case",
    "can only be answered by studying the relevant index theorem .",
    "other potential difficulties are related to the fermionic moduli that we have treated in a rather straightforward way , ignoring possible ambiguities due to the location of picture changing operators . in any case",
    "it would be helpful to have an explicit computation of the one - loop four point function .",
    "if that turns out to be non - vanishing it will be extremely interesting to see by which mechanism the derivation of the ward identities must be modified .",
