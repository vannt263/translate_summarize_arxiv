    "efimov effect first discovered by v. efimov in @xcite is one of the most intriguing phenomena in physics .",
    "this effect appears in 3-body systems in 3-dimensional space , which interact through short - range pair - potentials .",
    "it is always possible to tune the couplings of the interactions in such a way that none of the particle pairs has a negative energy bound state , but at least two pairs have a resonance at zero energy . in this case",
    "the 3-body system exhibits an infinite sequence of bound levels , where the energy of the @xmath3-th level decreases exponentially with @xmath3 .",
    "the rigorous proof of this effect in @xcite is a highlight of mathematical physics .",
    "suppose that three particles are identical , the pair interaction is tuned to the zero energy resonance , and let @xmath4 be the total number of 3-body bound states with the energy less than @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the root of the known transcendental equation expressed in elementary functions @xcite .",
    "relatively recently the authors in @xcite considered the system of 3 spinless fermions in flatland using field - theoretical methods .",
    "the spherically symmetric pair interaction of fermions was tuned in such a way that pairs of fermions had no negative spectrum but were at the coupling constant threshold @xcite , so that a negligible increase of the coupling constant would result in the formation of an antisymmetric 2-body bound state with negative energy . in this case",
    "one says that the interactions are tuned to the zero energy p - wave resonance . in @xcite",
    "the authors came to the conclusion that such system has two infinite series of bound states each corresponding to the orbital angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the energies of these bound states @xmath8 for large @xmath3 were predicted to approach the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is a constant defined modulo @xmath11 .",
    "the authors termed this phenomenon `` super efimov effect '' . if @xmath4 is the total number of 3-body bound states with the energy less than @xmath2 ( for all values of the angular momentum ) then the results in @xcite predict that @xmath12 there are two interesting features about the super efimov effect .",
    "first , it turns out that the system of 3 spinless fermions in two dimensions may have an infinite number of bound states , though the same system in 3 dimensions has at most a finite number of levels with negative energy @xcite .",
    "secondly , the energy of the @xmath3-th level goes extremely fast to zero with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "this is reflected in the double logarithm in ( [ 1 ] ) and differs from the efimov effect of 3 bosons in 3-dimensional space , where a single logarithm enters the similar formula @xcite .",
    "recently in the physics literature there were raised doubts about whether the super efimov effect is real @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was claimed that the sequence of levels with double exponential scaling does not exist and instead there emerges another infinite sequence of levels , which approaches the scaling law @xmath13 with @xmath14 being a non - universal constant .",
    "the findings in @xcite are in contradiction with eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) . in @xcite",
    "the authors observed the super efimov effect in the lowest order of the hyperspherical expansion .",
    "however , the value of the limit in ( [ 1 ] ) was found to be @xmath15 ; the inclusion of higher order effects could not provide definitive conclusions on whether the infinite sequence of levels exists . in the present paper",
    "we shall provide a rigorous mathematical proof of ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "hence , we demonstrate that the super efimov effect is indeed real and the constant on the rhs of ( [ 1 ] ) coincides exactly with the one predicted in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea behind the proof of ( [ 1 ] ) stems from @xcite , namely , one uses symmetrized faddeev equations and the birman - schwinger principle @xcite for counting eigenvalues . like in @xcite",
    "we reduce the problem to counting the eigenvalues in the interval @xmath16 of an integral operator , which depends on the energy .",
    "let us explain , however , the major difference . in @xcite",
    "when the energy approached zero this integral operator approached ( in the strong sense ) a bounded integral operator , which had a nonempty essential spectrum in the interval @xmath17 . in the 2-dimensional case",
    "a similar integral operator maintains discrete spectrum but its norm goes to infinity when the energy goes to zero .",
    "the control of appearing error terms becomes challenging because their norm diverges as well .",
    "we shall use the following notations .",
    "an abstract hilbert space @xmath18 is assumed to be separable , @xmath19 denotes the ideal of all compact operators on @xmath18 . for a self - adjoint operator @xmath20",
    "we denote by @xmath21 its non - negative eigenvalues ( counting multiplicities ) in descending order ; if this sequence terminates at @xmath22 we set @xmath23 . for a self - adjoint operator @xmath24 on @xmath18 we shall denote by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 the domain , the spectrum , and the essential spectrum of @xmath24 respectively @xcite .",

    "then @xmath93    theorem 1 provides a firm mathematical footing for the super efimov effect .",
