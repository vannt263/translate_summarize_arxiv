    "during the last 30 years the addition laws of elliptic functions stay in the focus of the studies in the nonlinear equations of mathematical physics .",
    "a large part of the interest was drawn to the subject by the works of f.  calogero  @xcite , where several important problems were reduced to the elliptic addition laws .",
    "the term `` calogero - moser model '' being widely used in literature , the papers caused a large series of publications , where on one hand more advanced problems were posed and on the other hand some advances were made in the theory of functional equations .",
    "the `` addition theorems '' for weierstrass elliptic functions : @xmath2 played the key rle in the works of the that period . at the same time , the development of the algebro - geometric methods of solution of integrable systems @xcite employed in an essential way the addition formulas for theta functions of several variables .",
    "the same addition formulas were needed in applications of hirota method . in @xcite the addition theorems for vector baker - akhiezer functions of several variables are obtained and a program is put forward to apply the addition theorems to problems of the theory of integrable systems , in particular , to multidimensional analogs of calogero - moser type systems .",
    "the fundamental fact of the elliptic functions theory is that any elliptic function can be represented as a rational function of weierstrass functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding result ( see @xcite ) in the theory of hyperelliptic abelian functions is formulated as follows : any hyperelliptic function can be represented as a rational function of vector functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the genus of the hyperelliptic curve on the jacobi variety of which the field of abelian functions is built . in particular , for the genus @xmath8 sigma - function we obtain the following trilinear differential addition theorem @xmath9\\sigma(u)\\sigma(v)\\sigma(w)\\big|_{u+v+w=0}=0.\\ ] ]    in the present paper we find the explicit formulas for the addition law of the vector functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 . as an application",
