    "kinematic data for galaxy clusters offer a unique possibility to study their mass distribution and the orbits of the galaxies within them . depending on the quality of data sample and",
    "the purpose of the analysis a number of methods of data modelling has been proposed , from the mass estimate based on the virial theorem @xcite , the jeans analysis with the two even velocity moments @xcite and the caustic technique @xcite to the recently presented kinematic deprojection with the mass inversion @xcite and the projected phase - space analysis with a fully anisotropic model of the distribution function @xcite .",
    "there is no doubt that the component which is best constrained with all methods of data modelling is the mass profile .",
    "the analysis of galaxy kinematics in nearby galaxy clusters revealed that the mass distribution is consistent with the universal nfw @xcite profile ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which was confirmed in other studies based on x - ray observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or lensing data ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "constraints on the parameters of the universal density profile of individual clusters from galaxy kinematics are available for a very limited number of objects ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the main aims of this work is to provide robust estimates of these parameters for a statistically significant sample of nearby ( @xmath1 ) galaxy clusters .",
    "constraining the anisotropy of galaxy orbits from kinematic data is a difficult task .",
    "the main problem arises from the so - called mass - anisotropy degeneracy which occurs in the jeans analysis of the velocity dispersion profile @xcite . in order to break this degeneracy a few solutions have been proposed .",
    "@xcite derived the velocity anisotropy profile by combining the jeans standard analysis with an independent constraint on the mass profile .",
    "this approach was adopted by several authors who used the estimate of the mass profile from the kinematics of ellipticals whose orbits appear to be distributed isotropically @xcite , lensing observations @xcite or x - ray data @xcite .",
    "another method to solve the problem of the mass - anisotropy degeneracy relies on modelling the degree of non - gaussianity in the velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "a way to account for this effect is to use two even velocity moments @xcite .",
    "apart from this , in a few attempts a full model of the distribution function has been used , but in all cases a flat anisotropy profile was assumed ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , this method is still promising .",
    "as shown by @xcite in a series of tests on mock kinematic data , the projected phase - space analysis with a suitable model of the distribution function proposed by @xcite allows to place robust constraints on the spatial variation of the orbital anisotropy within the virial sphere as well as on the total mass profile . in this paper , we follow the method described in @xcite to constrain the orbital anisotropy at the cluster centres and around the virial radius .",
    "most measurements of the orbital anisotropy in galaxy clusters have been obtained under the assumption of a flat profile .",
    "all results are consistent within errors with isotropic orbits ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several studies were devoted to constraining the spatial variation of the orbital anisotropy .",
    "the analysis of galaxy kinematics of individual clusters points to rather isotropic orbits , although the anisotropy exhibits a significant scatter between clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "more robust constraints on the anisotropy profile were obtained in the analysis of the composite clusters resulting from combining a number of kinematic data sets into one .",
    "it was demonstrated that the orbits of early type galaxies tend to be isotropic within the virial sphere , whereas late type galaxies are on predominantly radial orbits at the virial radius @xcite .",
    "this property is referred to as the orbital segregation and is commonly attributed to the orbital evolution from radially dominated orbits for spirals to isotropic ones for ellipticals .",
    "we note , however , that the orbital structure of both morphological types of galaxies can hardly be reconciled with the result of global isotropy .",
    "this problem is also addressed in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe our cluster sample as well as kinematic data and the method of interloper removal . in section 3 ,",
    "we outline the details of our method of the projected phase - space analysis",
    ". the results of the analysis are presented in section 4 . in the same section ,",
    "we discuss the constraints on the mass - concentration relation and study the mass scaling relations .",
    "section 5 is the devoted to comparison between our constraints on the parameters of the mass profile and those found in the literature and based on other methods . in section 6",
    ", we present two tests of consistency between the data and some assumptions underlying our analysis .",
    "the summary follows in section 7 . in this work",
    ", we adopted a flat @xmath11cdm cosmology with density parameter @xmath12 and the hubble constant @xmath13 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "the primary criterion for cluster selection is the number of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts per cluster .",
    "an optimum choice of a threshold for this number should result from the consideration of two contradictory effects .",
    "on one hand , the quality of statistical reasoning requires the number of redshifts to be as large as possible , but on the other we wish to build a sample with a statistically significant number of clusters which means that we also have to include clusters with a rather low number of spectroscopic redshifts . trying to find a compromise we checked the number of available redshifts per cluster , as provided by nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "we found that the optimal choice for the purpose of our analysis is to consider clusters with at least @xmath15 galaxies within the aperture of @xmath16 mpc and with velocities from the range @xmath17 km s@xmath14 in the rest frame of the cluster .",
    "the radius of the aperture equals to the virial radius of massive galaxy clusters and its role is to truncate all clusters to the approximate size of the virial sphere ( in projection ) .",
    "the velocity range @xmath18 km s@xmath14 is a commonly used velocity cut - off which allows to perform a preliminary separation of cluster members from the interlopers ( galaxies of background or foreground ) .    the second criterion for cluster selection concerns their dynamical state .",
    "the reason for considering this property is the fact that the basic assumption underlying our method of dynamical analysis is the state of equilibrium .",
    "it means that our sample should be possibly free of dynamically disturbed clusters , especially major mergers . in order to identify such clusters we studied x - ray images of clusters obtained with asca @xcite , xmm - newton @xcite and rosat @xcite satellites .",
    "we rejected all clusters whose images exhibit signatures of merger activity in the form of clearly visible distortions ( e.g. a3667 ) or the presence of massive subclusters ( e.g. a3558 , the most massive cluster in the shapley concentration ) .",
    "another approach to assess the dynamical state of clusters was to study the general properties of galaxy kinematics .",
    "this method was particularly important in the case of clusters for which x - ray data were not available . following this approach , we excluded all clusters with clearly asymmetric or bimodal velocity distributions which are good signatures of a merger or at least an accidental alignment of some structures .",
    "let us note that the analysis of galaxy kinematics was carried out after the proper removal of interlopers ( see subsection 2.4 ) .    as an independent test",
    ", we also checked for the presence of a cool core which appears to correlate with the dynamical state of clusters @xcite and may be regarded as an indicator of how relaxed the cluster is .",
    "we note , however , that the presence of a cool core was a secondary criterion of our selection .",
    "we used this criterion only in cases when the conclusions drawn from the kinematics or the x - ray image seemed to be ambiguous or contradictory .",
    "finally , we also excluded clusters which appear to be accompanied by other clusters at comparable redshifts and relative positions on the sky smaller than @xmath19 mpc which is around twice the expected virial radius for a typical cluster",
    ". the majority of them are binary clusters at the initial state of merging , e.g. a399 and a401 .",
    "the main reason for rejecting these systems is the fact that their velocity diagrams are severely contaminated by galaxies from neighbouring clusters . due to the proximity of these clusters both on the sky and in redshift space ,",
    "velocity diagrams overlap and the selection of cluster members becomes impossible or at least highly ambiguous .      in order to find all nearby ( @xmath1 ) galaxy clusters which satisfy selection criteria",
    "described above we searched ned and the recently published , but not yet included in ned , spectroscopic data from wings ( the wide field nearby galaxy cluster survey ) which is a photometric and spectroscopic survey of a few tens of nearby galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the final sample resulting from our data mining consists of @xmath0 galaxy clusters , out of which @xmath20 are rich clusters from the abell catalogue @xcite and one ( mkw 4 ) is a poor cluster containing a cd galaxy @xcite .",
    "table [ tab_prop ] provides the list of all clusters as well as their basic observational properties , such as the heliocentric redshift @xmath21 , the number of spectroscopic redshifts within the aperture of @xmath16 mpc and the velocity range @xmath17 km s@xmath14 around the mean @xmath22 and after the removal of interlopers ( see subsection 2.4 ) @xmath23 .",
    ".observational properties of galaxy clusters selected for the analysis .",
    "the table includes the cluster name , heliocentric redshift ( @xmath21 ) , number of galaxy redshifts within the aperture @xmath16 mpc and the velocity range @xmath17 km s@xmath14 ( @xmath22 ) , number of redshifts after interloper removal ( @xmath23 ) , bautz - morgan morphological type ( b - m type ) and the comment on a cool core judged on the basis of : @xmath24@xcite , @xmath25@xcite , @xmath26@xcite , @xmath27@xcite .",
    "superscript @xmath28 marks clusters from the wings survey . [ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that there is no trend in the mean value of the residuals .",
    "one may notice a negative bias in the outer asymptotic value of the anisotropy profile for @xmath29 mpc .",
    "this is , however , a consequence of the fact that using a smaller aperture we probe the inner part of the clusters for which the orbits are more isotropic .",
    "we also note that the logarithmic dispersions which describe the scatter of the relative residuals are smaller or comparable to the relative errors associated with the @xmath30 credibility ranges listed in table  [ tab_para ] . this property together with the stability of the mean values means that our results are not sensitive to the change of the truncation radius of velocity diagrams .",
    "this excludes the possibility that the data may be subject to a significant incompleteness effect .      as a second test of self - consistency between the assumptions of our analysis and the data we show in fig .",
    "[ sigma_test ] the surface number density of galaxies in all clusters combined into one .",
    "the surface density was evaluated in radial bins equally spaced in logarithmic scale , where the universal scaling of radii by @xmath31 was adopted ( @xmath32 is the number of galaxies within the @xmath33 aperture ) .",
    "the points above @xmath34 were corrected for the incompleteness of velocity diagrams which occurs due to the fact that the value of @xmath35 is not universal in the cluster sample . as a line of reference we plotted the projected nfw profile ( black solid line ) . apart from radii above @xmath36 ,",
    "where some deviations between the model and the data occur mostly due to the problem of incompleteness , galaxy density is well approximated by the nfw profile .",
    "our data for small radii do not reveal a signature of a core in galaxy distribution , as advocated by @xcite .",
    "although our analysis concerns the projected densities , we may conclude from fig .",
    "[ sigma_test ] that the assumption of our phase - space density model about a constant mass - to - number density is also satisfied .",
    "this confirms the observational fact that has already been discussed in the literature ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper we presented the analysis of @xmath0 nearby ( @xmath1 ) relaxed galaxy clusters . using the method based on the modelling of velocity diagrams in terms of the projected phase - space density , as described in section 3 , we constrained parameters of the total mass and anisotropy profiles in these clusters .",
    "parameter estimation was carried out in the framework of bayesian data analysis with the use of the mcmc technique .",
    "we found that the concentration parameter is weakly correlated with the morphological type of the clusters as well as with the presence of a cool core .",
    "we interpret this fact as a signature of cluster evolution from the state with a flatter density profile ( low concentration parameter ) to one with a steeper density profile ( higher concentration parameter ) .",
    "our explanation is consistent with the recent results of cosmological simulations which predict steeper density profiles for more dynamically evolved clusters @xcite .",
    "the virial mass of the clusters correlates very well with the velocity dispersion , the x - ray temperature and the x - ray luminosity of the clusters .",
    "the slopes of the mass scaling relations agree with the estimates found in the literature and in the case of the velocity dispersion and x - ray temperature are consistent with the prediction from the virial theorem .",
    "we used constraints on the virial mass and the concentration parameter to test the most up - to - date estimates of the @xmath5 parameter against the observational relation between the virial mass and the concentration parameter . comparing the normalization of the mass - concentration relation for our cluster sample with the calibration from cosmological simulations we found that our data favours a rather high value , @xmath37 . like @xcite",
    ", we found an excellent agreement with @xmath5 from the 1st data release of the wmap satellite .",
    "our model of the projected phase - space density allowed us to constrain the profile of the orbital anisotropy in clusters .",
    "we showed at high significance level that galaxy orbits are isotropic in the cluster centres and radially anisotropic at the virial sphere , with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "this finding is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite for late type galaxies in nearby galaxy clusters and generalizes a number of estimates of the global anisotropy of galaxy orbits in clusters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our constraints on the asymptotic values of the anisotropy parameter implies a growth of the anisotropy from @xmath40 at the cluster centre to @xmath41 at the scale radius .",
    "interestingly , this result agrees fairly well with recent estimates of the anisotropy for dark matter in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the orbital anisotropy at the virial sphere of the low concentration clusters tends to be more radially biased than for the clusters of high concentration parameter .",
    "we suggest that this tendency is a consequence of a change in the galaxy orbits from radially biased at the early stage of cluster evolution to more isotropic for more dynamically evolved clusters .",
    "this scenario is supported by the studies of the orbital anisotropy for different galaxy populations which reveals a similar dichotomy between early and late type galaxies representing more and less relaxed galaxy populations in the clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
