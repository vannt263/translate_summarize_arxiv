    "the problem of fading and the ways to combat it through spatial diversity techniques have been an active area of research .",
    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques have become popular in realizing spatial diversity and high data rates through the use of multiple transmit antennas . for such co - located multiple transmit antenna systems low maximum - likelihood ( ml ) decoding complexity space - time block codes ( stbcs )",
    "have been studied by several researchers @xcite-@xcite which include the well known complex orthogonal designs ( cods ) and their generalizations .",
    "recent research has shown that the advantages of spatial diversity could be realized in single - antenna user nodes through user cooperation @xcite,@xcite via relaying .",
    "a simple wireless relay network of @xmath3 nodes consists of a single source - destination pair with @xmath0 relays . for such relay channels , use of cods",
    "@xcite,@xcite has been studied in @xcite .",
    "cods are attractive for cooperative communications for the following reasons : @xmath4 they offer full diversity gain and coding gain , @xmath5 they are ` scale free ' in the sense that deleting some rows does not affect the orthogonality , @xmath6 entries are linear combination of the information symbols and their conjugates which means only linear processing is required at the relays , and @xmath7 they admit very fast ml decoding ( single - symbol decoding ( ssd ) ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that the last property applies only to the decode - and - forward ( df ) policy at the relay node .    in a scenario where the relays amplify and forward ( af ) the signal",
    ", it is known that the orthogonality is lost , and hence the destination has to use a complex multi - symbol ml decoding or sphere decoding @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the af policy is attractive for two reasons : @xmath4 the complexity at the relay is greatly reduced , and @xmath5 the restrictions on the rate because the relay has to decode is avoided @xcite .    in order to avoid the complex ml decoding at the destination , in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose an alternative code design strategy and propose a ssd code for 2 and 4 relays .",
    "for arbitrary number of relays , recently in @xcite , distributed orthogonal stbcs ( dostbcs ) have been studied and it is shown that if the destination has the complete channel state information ( csi ) of all the source - to - relay channels and the relay - to - destination channels , then the maximum possible rate is upper bounded by @xmath1 complex symbols per channel use for @xmath0 relays . towards improving the rate of transmission and achieving simultaneously both full - diversity as well as ssd at the destination , in this paper , we study relay channels with the assumption that the relays have the phase information of the source - to - relay channels and the destination has the csi of all the channels .",
    "coding for partially - coherent relay channel ( pcrc , section [ pcrc_sec ] ) has been studied in @xcite , where a sufficient condition for ssd has been presented .",
    "the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * first , a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a stbc to be ssd for co - located multiple antenna communication is obtained .",
    "the known set of necessary and sufficient conditions in @xcite is in terms of the dispersion matrices ( weight matrices ) of the code , whereas our new set of conditions is in terms of the column vector representation matrices @xcite of the code and is a generalization of the conditions given in @xcite in terms of column vector representation matrices for cods . * a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a distributed stbc ( dstbc ) to be ssd for a pcrc is obtained by identifying the additional conditions . using this , several ssd dstbcs for pcrc",
    "are identified among the known classes of stbcs for co - located multiple antenna system . *",
    "it is proved that even if a ssd stbc for a co - located mimo channel does not satisfy the additional conditions for the code to be ssd for a pcrc , single - symbol decoding of it in a pcrc gives full - diversity and only coding gain is lost . *",
    "it is shown that when a dstbc is ssd for a pcrc , then arbitrary coordinate interleaving of the in - phase and quadrature - phase components of the variables does not disturb its ssd property for pcrc . *",
    "it is shown that the possibility of _ channel phase compensation _ operation at the relay nodes using partial csi at the relays increases the possible rate of ssd dstbcs from @xmath1 when the relays do not have csi to @xmath8 which is independent of @xmath0 . *",
    "extensive simulation results are presented to illustrate the above contributions .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , the signal model for a pcrc is developed . using this model , in section [ sec3 ] , a new set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a stbc to be ssd in a co -",
    "located mimo is presented .",
    "several classes of ssd codes are discussed and conditions for full - diversity of a subclass of ssd codes is obtained .",
    "then , in section [ sec4 ] , ssd dstbcs for pcrc are characterized by identifying a set of necessary and sufficient conditions .",
    "it is shown that the ssd property is invariant under coordinate interleaving operations which leads to a class of ssd dstbcs for pcrc . the class of rate half cods obtained from rate one real orthogonal designs ( rods ) by stacking construction @xcite is shown to be ssd for pcrc .",
    "also , it is shown that ssd codes for co - located mimo , under suboptimal ssd decoder for pcrc offer full diversity .",
    "simulation results and discussion constitute section [ sec5 ] .",
    "conclusions and scope for further work are presented in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "consider a wireless network with @xmath3 nodes consisting of a source , a destination , and @xmath0 relays , as shown in fig .",
    "all nodes are half - duplex nodes , i.e. , a node can either transmit or receive at a time on a specific frequency .",
    "we consider amplify - and - forward ( af ) transmission at the relays .",

    "we assume that the source - to - relay channels remain static over @xmath10 time slots , and the relay - to - destination channels remain static over @xmath11 time slots .",

    "no channel knowledge is assumed at the relays . under the assumption of no csi at the relays ,",
    "the amplified @xmath15th received signal at the @xmath13th relay can be written as @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transmit energy per transmission of a symbol in the relay phase , and @xmath28 is the amplification factor at the relay that makes the total transmission energy per symbol in the relay phase to be equal to @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the total energy per symbol in both the phases put together .",
    "then , it is shown in @xcite that the optimum energy allocation that maximizes the receive snr at the destination is when half the energy is spent in the broadcast phase and the remaining half in the relay phase when the time allocations for the relay and broadcast phase are same i.e. , @xmath30 .",

    "we can write @xmath66      in this subsection , we obtain a signal model for the case of partial csi at the relays , where we assume that each relay has the knowledge of the channel phase on the link between the source and itself in the broadcast phase . that is , defining the channel gain from source to relay @xmath13 as @xmath67",
    ", we assume that relay @xmath13 has perfect knowledge of only @xmath68 and does not have the knowledge of @xmath69    in the proposed scheme , we perform a phase compensation operation on the amplified received signals at the relays , and space - time encoding is done on these phase - compensated signals .",

    "amplify - and - forward ( af ) schemes in cooperative communications are attractive because of their simplicity .",
    "full diversity ( fd ) , linear - complexity single symbol decoding ( ssd ) , and high rates of dstbcs are three important attributes to work towards af cooperative communications . earlier work in @xcite has shown that , without assuming phase knowledge at the relays , fd and ssd can be achieved in af distributed orthogonal stbc schemes ; however , the rate achieved decreases linearly with the number of relays @xmath0 .",
    "our work in this paper established that if phase knowledge is exploited at the relays in the way we have proposed , then fd , ssd , and high rate can be achieved simultaneously ; in particular , the rate achieved in our scheme can be @xmath2 , which is independent of the number of relays @xmath0 .",
    "we proved the ssd for our scheme in theorem 2 .",
    "fd was proved in theorem 6 .",
    "rate-1/2 construction for any @xmath0 was presented in theorem 5 .",
    "in addition to these results , we also established other results regarding @xmath4 invariance of ssd under coordinate interleaving ( theorem 4 ) , and @xmath5 retention of fd even with single - symbol non - ml decoding .",
    "simulation results confirming the claims were presented .",
    "all these important results have not been shown in the literature so far .",
    "these results offer useful insights and knowledge for the designers of future cooperative communication based systems ( e.g. , cooperative communication ideas are being considered in future evolution of standards like ieee 802.16 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we have assumed only phase knowledge at the relays .",
    "of course , one can assume that both amplitude as well as the phase of source - to - relay are known at the relay .",
    "a natural question that can arise then is ` what can amplitude knowledge at the relay ( in addition to phase knowledge ) buy ? ' since we have shown that phase knowledge alone is adequate to achieve fd , some extra coding gain may be possible with amplitude knowledge .",
