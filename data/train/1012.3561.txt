    "since its inception 13 years ago , the gauge / gravity duality @xcite has engendered vigorous exploration of properties of non - abelian gauge theories by studying their gravitational dual .",
    "one of the crucial attributes is the strong / weak coupling nature of the duality : in the limit of strong coupling and high rank of the gauge group , the theory is described in terms of classical gravity on a higher - dimensional asymptotically anti de sitter ( ads ) background .",
    "such dual picture has offered invaluable insight into the behavior of the field theory in the regime of strong coupling where quantum effects dominate and traditional methods prove inadequate .",
    "one of the most natural questions concerning properties of a strongly - coupled medium concerns its ability to transmit signals .",
    "in particular , how does ` radiation ' propagate in such a medium ?",
    "while this question has been well - studied for numerous weakly coupled systems , the strong coupling case is much more interesting , and of potential relevance to experimentally attainable settings . of course , to achieve closest contact with systems such as the quark gluon plasma produced at the relativistic heavy ion collider , one would like to study strongly coupled field theories at high temperature",
    ".    nevertheless , while perhaps less indicative of real - world systems , the zero - temperature setting is also of active interest , since it provides an excellent toy model for the more realistic cases while being amenable to exact calculations . from the gravitational dual standpoint , zero temperature constitutes a drastic simplification because the vacuum of the gauge theory corresponds to pure ads , whereas a thermal state corresponds to a schwarzschild - ads black hole , which is both geometrically and causally more complicated .",
    "for example , while an exact solution for a string with its endpoint following a given trajectory is known in pure ads for arbitrary endpoint trajectories , in schwarzschild - ads an analogous solution is known only in special cases with high enough symmetry . nevertheless , once a given setup has been well - understood at zero temperature",
    ", one can then use this as a crutch to extend the analysis to non - zero temperature .",
    "a very interesting recent study of radiation in strongly coupled gauge theory at zero temperature was undertaken in @xcite for the case of a quark in uniform circular motion .",

    "the gravitational dual consists of a fundamental string in ads spacetime whose endpoint is anchored at the quark on the boundary .",
    "the quark s trajectory then determines the string s embedding in ads .",
    "the string , having non - trivial stress tensor supported on its world - volume , backreacts on the bulk spacetime , which in turn induces a non - trivial stress tensor in the boundary field theory .",
    "the authors of @xcite compute the corresponding boundary energy density by solving linearized einstein s equations in the bulk .",
    "they find a rather surprising result : the radiation closely resembles synchrotron radiation exhibited in classical electrodynamics and weakly - coupled sym .",
    "in particular , the radiation pulse does not broaden as it propagates outward , despite the field theory being strongly coupled .",
    "indeed , this result is just as remarkable from the gravitational dual standpoint , since it implies that the backreaction effects from string bits deep in the bulk are somehow ` beamed ' towards the boundary , contradicting naive expectations from the scale / radius ( or uv / ir ) duality @xcite , according to which an excitation deeper in the bulk should be represented by a more dispersed signal in the boundary field theory .",
    "this mysterious beaming effect in fact prompted the present study , which was recently summarized in @xcite .",
    "in particular , our main goal is to attain better geometrical understanding of how the backreaction effects of a bulk string manage to produce a tightly collimated beam on the boundary .",
    "as it turns out , this has the added benefit of simplifying the stress tensor calculation itself .    while far simpler than any conceivable direct method within the field theory ,",
    "the calculation of @xcite is still fairly involved . here",
    "we propose a much easier method to obtain the boundary stress tensor , in a straightforward and computationally non - intensive manner which essentially reduces to finding geodesics in ads .",
    "this simplification applies to the regime where the string is sufficiently relativistic , which , as we discuss below , includes the present case of interest , and indeed occurs quite generically for bulk dual describing radiation from an accelerating quark .",
    "it rests on the observation that in such a regime , the backreaction of the string is captured by a superposition of gravitational shock waves sourced by individual string bits . justifying and testing this proposal against the results of @xcite will be the main focus of the present work .",
    "once the string s backreaction is understood in terms of gravitational shock waves , it elucidates the mechanism producing the observed non - dispersive character of the boundary radiation .",
    "this is due to the geometrical nature of the gravitational shock waves @xcite : each shock wave is supported on a null hypersurface in the spacetime , which means that the influence of the backreaction is not allowed to disperse as naively expected . as we will demonstrate",
    ", it is the combined effect from the set of all such shock waves produced by the string that leads to the observed phenomenon of the radiation pulses having correct width and propagating at the speed of light without broadening .",
    "this has further interesting implications for the scale / radius duality , as discussed below .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in",
    "we introduce the circling quark configuration and the corresponding bulk dual in more detail .",
    "this allows us to review the key observations of @xcite , which provide a sharp testing - ground for our proposal . in we detail our proposal for the beaming mechanism .",
    "we first justify our expectations based on general principles and then explain how to calculate the backreaction explicitly .",
    "the actual calculations are relegated to the appendices , in order to maintain the flow of the main text .",
    "having outlined the construction , in we present the results of implementing this construction .",
    "we first do so numerically , by plotting various aspects of our prediction for the energy density induced on the boundary .",
    "we then determine the salient features of this energy density analytically in the asymptotic regime , which allows more detailed quantitative comparison with @xcite .",
    "we summarize our findings in and end by discussing further applications and extensions of our construction .",
    "let us start by reviewing the essential ingredients of the work of @xcite , which uses the ads / cft correspondence to study the radiation from a quark in uniform circular motion in a strongly coupled field theory at zero temperature",
    ". in the gravitational dual , such set - up corresponds to a string in ads , ending on the quark .",
    "as indicated above , the gravitational backreaction of the string deforms the bulk geometry away from ads , and this in turn induces a non - trivial stress tensor on the boundary , which captures both the motion of the quark , as well as the resulting radiation .    to analyze the set - up more explicitly ,",
    "let us first fix the notation .",
    "we will consider the field theory to be formulated on minkowski spacetime .",
    "] so the notion of radiation is best - defined in the asymptotic region @xmath4 .",
    "the source of the radiation is a test quark moving on a circle of radius @xmath5 with constant angular velocity @xmath6 , so that its trajectory is given by @xmath7 and the quark moves with constant speed @xmath8 , with the corresponding lorentz factor @xmath9 . in the gravitational dual ,",

    "we see that in the limit @xmath32 , the string hugs the boundary , so that we expect the boundary stress tensor being localized just above the string , as is indeed confirmed by explicit calculation .",
    "we now discuss several key aspects of the geometry in a bit more detail .",
    "[ [ worldsheet - horizon ] ] worldsheet horizon : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let us first consider the causal structure of the worldsheet metric .",
    "it is intriguing to note that despite the bulk having the causally trivial structure of pure ads , the worldsheet metric corresponds to a black hole geometry , with an event horizon at @xmath33 ( this is easy to see by finding the induced metric on the worldsheet @xmath34 explicitly , @xmath35 and noting that since the metric is static , the killing horizon at @xmath36 coincides with the event horizon . )",
    "this suggests that beyond @xmath37 , the boundary stress tensor will describe radiation form the quark rather than the gluonic ` halo ' of the quark itself .",
    "the total power radiated by the quark coincides with the energy flux down the string , which @xcite evaluate to be @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the quark s proper acceleration .",
    "[ [ transverse - velocity ] ] transverse velocity : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    an important quantity in what follows is the string s velocity .",
    "since a fundamental string has no longitudinal excitations , a natural quantity to describe the string s motion is the transverse velocity of the string , @xmath40 . in the static gauge chosen above with @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath42 is a purely spatial vector , given by the component of @xmath43 perpendicular to the string , @xmath44 the time dependence is trivial since the string rotates rigidly , and using the parameterization , in the coordinates @xmath45 , we find that @xmath46 we see that the direction of the transverse velocity points towards larger @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath12 . in particular , note that @xmath42 points _ away _ from the ads boundary . in the interesting regime of large @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the leading @xmath45 components of @xmath51 approach @xmath52 .    of greater interest",
    "is the magnitude of the transverse velocity .",
    "using we can evaluate , we use only the flat spatial metric without its conformal factor @xmath53 because the @xmath14 direction is likewise scaled by the same conformal factor .",
    "] this to be @xmath54 it is then easy to see that the transverse speed of the string increases monotonically with @xmath12 , and asymptotes the speed of light deep in the bulk . for future use , also note that the product of this speed and the associated lorentz boost factor @xmath55 , which characterizes to what extend is the string moving relativistically , is given by @xmath56 with the worldsheet horizon @xmath57 defined in .",
    "[ [ boundary - stress - tensor ] ] boundary stress tensor : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now summarize the key results of @xcite . to find how the radiation induced by the quark s acceleration propagates through the strongly coupled medium ,",
    "@xcite consider the energy density @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the boundary stress tensor .",
    "since the on - shell bulk gravitational action is the generating functional for the boundary stress tensor , @xmath59 can be read - off from the asymptotic form of the bulk metric deformation . in particular , using the bulk stress tensor produced by the string , @xcite solve the linearized einstein s equations near the boundary .",
    "this yields an analytic few - line expression for @xmath60 ( see eq.(3.70 ) of @xcite , plotted in their fig.4 ) in terms of retarded time @xmath61 which is evaluated numerically .",
    "as remarked above , this boundary energy density turns out to have rather surprising properties : it is mainly supported on a thin spiral rotating rigidly at constant angular velocity , with the energy pulses _ not _ widening in the boundary - radial direction . ; at non - zero temperature , these pulses would widen , slow down , and eventually thermalize . however , for @xmath62 , the synchrotron radiation persists on length scales smaller than the thermal scale @xmath63 . ]",
    "the radiation pattern is in fact in close quantitative agreement with that of a corresponding radiation at weak coupling , which likewise mimics that of synchrotron radiation in classical electrodynamics .",
    "more specifically , the energy density @xmath64 exhibits the following salient features .    *",
    "each pulse remains constant width as it propagates outward , i.e.  it does not broaden .",
    "* a pulse propagates outward at the speed of light , independently of the quark velocity @xmath24 .",
    "if we change the quark velocity @xmath24 , the quatitative features of @xmath64 change in response :    * the spatial separation between the spiral arms of @xmath64 at a fixed time narrows with increasing @xmath24 as @xmath65 , as implied by the previous point .",
    "* pulse width decreases with increasing @xmath24 as @xmath66 .",
    "* @xmath67 decreases off the orbital plane , with the characteristic width narrowing for increasing @xmath24 as @xmath68 .",
    "as argued in @xcite , these features , most notably the first point , are quite surprising from the field theory point of view : since the radiation is strongly coupled , one might have expected it to diffuse and isotropize .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that in fact all of these features are reproduced by our simple method of estimating the backreaction of a relativistic string , which we now discuss .",
    "the curious features of the radiation propagating through a strongly coupled medium summarized above are no less surprising and fascinating from the bulk standpoint : why does the gravitational backreaction of the bulk string behave in such a sharply - localized fashion ? as pointed out in the introduction , this is at odds with the naive expectations from the scale / radius duality that the deeper parts of the string would produce more diffuse signals on the boundary . in this section",
    ", we propose a general mechanism which leads to the observed localization ; we refer to this mechanism as ` beaming ' .",
    "first of all , note that large part of the string is moving relativistically .",
    "this is evident from , and more conveniently quantified by : as long as @xmath69 ( for any @xmath12 ) or @xmath70 ( for any @xmath24 ) , the string s transverse velocity is relativistic @xmath71 .",
    "the object then is to understand how such a relativistic string backreacts on the spacetime .",
    "we use a well - known fact that the backreaction of a massless particle moving at the speed of light is given by a _ gravitational shock wave _ @xcite .",
    "such metric perturbation is supported on a null plane transverse to the particle s velocity , analogously to the behaviour of the electric field for an infinitely - boosted charge in classical electrodynamics .",
    "accordingly , the backreaction of all ` string bits ' ( viewed as a continuum of particles distributed along the string ) , moving relativistically in the direction of @xmath42 , should be given by a superposition of such gravitational shock waves , one for each particle .",
    "we therefore propose that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the backreaction of the full string is well - approximated by a linear superposition of gravitational shock waves normal to the string s transverse velocity .",

    "we first justify why  is a good approximation to the string s backreaction , we then explain how to find the  explicitly , and finally we indicate how to extract the boundary stress tensor induced by such . since the exact result for the boundary energy density @xmath64 is known from the calculation of @xcite , we can readily test our proposal by comparing our results with @xcite , which will be carried out in detail in .      our proposal that the string s backreaction is well - approximated by superposition of gravitational shock waves , , rests on several important assumptions , which we will try to justify in turn .    [ [ neglecting - string - tension ] ] neglecting string tension : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    firstly , we require that the interaction between the individual string bits does not contribute appreciably to the backreaction of the string",
    ". admittedly such an assumption would fail for a slowly - moving string where longitudinal boost invariance of the string s stress tensor implies that the ( negative ) pressure is of the same magnitude as the energy density .",
    "however , under transverse boosts with lorentz factor @xmath55 , energy density is enhanced by a factor of @xmath72 compared to the pressure which captures the effect of interactions .",
    "in fact , this is not surprising , given the parton model of the string @xcite .",
    "this means that our assumption of non - interaction becomes arbitrarily good for high enough string s transverse velocity , so that in the relativistic regime we can indeed treat the string as composed of relativistic particles .",
    "[ [ gsw - from - each - string - bit ] ] gsw from each string bit : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the second assumption is that each string bit produces a backreaction in the form of gsw , which is valid as long as the string s transverse velocity is sufficiently relativistic . as observed above , guarantees @xmath73 whenever either the quark velocity is sufficiently relativistic ( @xmath69 ) or the string bit under consideration is sufficiently deep in the bulk ( @xmath70 ) , which quantifies the regime of validity of our second assumption .",
    "we note that this regime of validity happily coincides with our regime of interest : in particular , we are interested in @xmath64 at @xmath74 where the notion of radiation is well defined , which indeed originates from the string bits at @xmath70 .    [ [ linear - superposition - of - gsws ] ] linear superposition of gsws : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    finally , we assume that the individual gsws superpose linearly , despite the nonlinearities of general relativity .",
    "although this may not hold for arbitrary gsws  for example head - on collisions can produce black holes ( see e.g.  @xcite , and more recent work reviewed in @xcite )  it does hold in our case : examining the geometry in detail , we can show that the individual gsws intersect mildly enough ( in the sense indicated in the next section ) , and their interaction is strongest at the string itself . because we started with a nearly - test string , the gsws produced by its backreaction will themselves backreact parametrically less",
    "( by @xmath75 in the present context ) .",
    "hence , given that @xcite justifiably used linearized gravity to calculate the string s backreaction , it is certainly valid to use linearized gravity for the gsws backreaction .",
    "this justifies superposing individual gsws to estimate the backreaction of the string .",
    "having justified why we may take the string to backreact in a manner which is captured by , we now proceed to construct such a superposition explicitly .",
    "the key step is understanding how a single string bit , moving relativistically in the direction of @xmath42 , backreacts on ads .",
    "such a metric is given by the ads analog of the aichelburg - sexl metric @xcite describing a gravitational shock wave in flat spacetime .",
    "by @xcite and studied further in @xcite . ]",
    "geometrically , a gsw in flat spacetime is supported on a ` transverse null plane ' ; in ads , which is conformally flat , there is a corresponding transverse null hypersurface .",
    "although one could construct this explicitly by a similar procedure to @xcite , we will instead use a trick , detailed in .",
    "we observe that a spatial slice of gsw at a fixed time forms a hypersurface which is generated by spacelike geodesics , emanating from its source in a direction normal to the source s velocity @xmath42 . while this is readily apparent in the coordinates used in @xcite simply by symmetry arguments , the statement as such is a geometric one , and therefore holds in any coordinate system .",
    "this means that to find the support of a gsw in ads at constant @xmath14 , written in the form , we only need to find the constant-@xmath14 spacelike geodesics , whose initial position @xmath76 lies along the string and initial velocity points normally to @xmath42 .    as we show explicitly in",

    "this will be discussed in , but as a zeroth order estimate , we can determine where @xmath64 dominates . at each bulk radius @xmath12 ,",

    "in fact , there the authors conjectured that the natural length scale would be given by @xmath157 ; here we confirm the @xmath5 scaling and the coefficient up to a @xmath158 factor .",
    "in the preceding section we have described the important features of the boundary energy density @xmath159 induced by a relativistic coiling string in the bulk .",
    "we proposed approximating this by a superposition of gravitational shock waves produced by each string bit  we dubbed this the ` beaming mechanism '  and calculated the consequences of this proposal . in particular , we have obtained the characteristic spiral pattern of synchrotron radiation ( cf .  e.g.  ) .",
    "we have calculated the spacing , phase , width , speed of propagation , and polar extent , of each energy pulse , and found each of these characteristic features in complete quantitative agreement with the computations of @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that it is indeed valid to view the string s backreaction as given by superposition of gravitational shock waves . from a computational perspective , this presents a major simplification : instead of having to solve the full linearized einstein s equations in the bulk , we merely need to find geodesics . in fact , this provides a useful tool for understanding the radiation of a relativistic quark following an arbitrary trajectory , since the string tends to become more relativistic deeper in the bulk and develops a worldsheet horizon , making the  approximation more accurate further away from the quark . since for any quark trajectory the corresponding string motion",
    "is known explicitly @xcite , we can construct the  just as easily as for the synchrotron case discussed above .",
    "encouraged by the success in using  in ads to reproduce the synchrotron radiation in strongly coupled medium at zero temperature calculated in @xcite , a natural question to ask is whether this method also applies in the case of non - zero temperature .",
    "indeed , once one generalizes the gsw construction to schwarzschild - ads background , one should likewise be able to estimate at least some part of the quark s radiation in a thermal strongly - coupled plasma , which should suffice to reproduce , for instance , the diffusion wake and sonic boom generated by a moving quark @xcite .",
    "however , it is important to realize that in the presence of a bulk ads black hole , the string no longer remains relativistic deep in the bulk , so the  approximation will have much more constrained regime of validity  in particular , it will no longer improve with distance from the quark .",
    "zeroth order expectations from directly adapting our geodesic construction would suggest that the radiation which starts out collimated diffuses on a thermal scale ; as is indeed consistent with expectations form the field theory side .",
    "moreover , the construction of a gravitational shock wave itself , in schwarzschild - ads background , is substantially more involved and is it no longer guaranteed that the metric perturbation from schwarzschild - ads due to a relativistic particle would remain similarly localized .",
    "nevertheless , given some region where the  approximation is accurate , it may be possible to go beyond the initial regime of validity by performing series expansion in @xmath160 and building up the backreaction effects order - by - order .",
    "we however leave this for future work .",
    "finally , we end with the issue which originally motivated the present work , namely how the observed beaming effect bears on the scale / radius duality .",
    "recall that scale / radius ( or uv / ir ) duality @xcite , which has been one of the first and most important entries in the ads / cft dictionary , suggests that the closer a bulk excitation is to the ads boundary , the smaller is the characteristic size of the dual cft excitation .",
    "this provides an important insight into the holographic nature of the ads / cft duality : the ` extra ' ( radial ) dimension in the bulk arises from a scale in the dual cft .",
    "this intuition has bolstered our understanding of various dynamical processes .",
    "for example , the field theory notion of color transparency , that different - scale excitations pass through each other without interacting , is beautifully explained by bulk locality : in the bulk , the corresponding excitations do not interact due to being separated in the radial direction . from this , one might have naively expected that same - scale excitations passing through each other would interact .",
    "however , the present context emphasized that naive applications of the scale / radius duality should be treated with caution .",
    "in particular , as we have seen , a source deep in the bulk of ads may nevertheless produce a sharply - localized effect on the boundary . by taking an ordinary source and a beamed source",
    ", we can engineer a situation where two excitations with ( instantaneously ) similar characteristic scale do not interact ( because within the bulk they are well separated ) , as well the converse situation where two excitations with widely differing scale nevertheless do interact ( because the dual bulk excitations collide with each other ) .",
    "the beaming mechanism , which underlies such constructions , is quite interesting .",
    "the relativistic velocity of the string causes the backreaction due to each string bit to be localized on a co - dimension one surface of the gsw .",
    "although the size of this surface grows with the bulk position of the source ( it has larger radius for the string bits deeper in bulk ) , the dominant effect is sharply peaked .",
    "the final ingredient , however , is the superposition of all the gsws from individual string bits , as emphasized most clearly by .",
    "it is due to this combined effect that the radiation pulse on the boundary does not broaden as it propagates outward .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank paul chesler , roberto emparan , gary gibbons , gary horowitz , hong liu , shiraz minwalla , rob myers , joe polchinski , and mukund rangamani for valuable discussions .",

    "although a change of coordinates of the form @xmath171 considered by @xcite corresponds to a radial null geodesic @xmath172 at @xmath173 , we could generalize this to arbitrary direction , by simply making an extra change of the @xmath31 coordinates , @xmath174 where @xmath175 is the requisite lorentz transformation to rotate the direction of motion .",

    "<S> we propose a new and simple method of estimating the radiation due to an accelerated quark in a strongly coupled medium , within the framework of the ads / cft correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we offer a heuristic explanation of the collimated nature of synchrotron radiation produced by a circling quark , which was recently studied in phys.rev.*d81 * ( 2010 ) 126001 . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational dual of such quark is a coiling string in ads , whose backreaction on the spacetime geometry remains tightly confined , as if ` beamed ' towards the boundary . while this appears to contradict conventional expectations from the scale / radius duality , we resolve the issue by observing that the backreaction of a relativistic string is reproduced by a superposition of gravitational shock waves . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that this proposal allows us to reduce the problem of computing the boundary stress tensor to merely calculating geodesics in ads , as opposed to solving linearized einstein s equations .    </S>",
