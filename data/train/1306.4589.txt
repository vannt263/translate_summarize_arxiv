    "turbulence plays an important role in mediating the transport of particles , momentum , and energy in a wide variety of plasma environments . from the solar interior , through the solar corona , throughout the interplanetary medium to the magnetospheres of the earth and other planets , and to the interaction of the heliosphere with the local interstellar medium , turbulence influences the evolution of the plasma environment .",
    "further afield , from accretion disks surrounding compact objects , to the interstellar medium filling the galaxy , to the intracluster medium within galaxy clusters , turbulence mediates the transport of angular momentum and energy to impact the observed appearance and evolution of each system .",
    "finally , in the laboratory plasmas of the magnetic confinement fusion energy program , plasma turbulence plays a key role in limiting the efficiency of proposed fusion reactors . in astrophysical plasmas",
    ", the turbulence appears to be dominated by alfvnic fluctuations , and it is now widely accepted that the turbulent cascade of energy develops anisotropically with respect to the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "in addition , although the large - scale turbulent motions in many astrophysical environments are sometimes adequately described by the fluid description of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , at the small scales on which the turbulence is dissipated , the dynamics is often weakly collisional , and therefore a kinetic description of the turbulent dynamics is necessary .    the study of turbulence in a kinetic plasma , or _ kinetic turbulence _",
    "@xcite , represents a new frontier in the study of heliospheric and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the investigation of kinetic turbulence represents a significant challenge both theoretically and numerically due to the six - dimensional phase space of the kinetic description .",
    "the computational cost of kinetic numerical simulations of astrophysical turbulence is orders of magnitude greater than that of a comparable fluid simulation , and it is tempting to pursue a program of turbulence simulations with reduced spatial dimensionality .",
    "we demonstrate here that alfvnic turbulence in a magnetized plasma is , however , inherently three - dimensional , and the applicability of results based on two - dimensional simulations to astrophysical plasma systems remains to be established .    in this study",
    ", we explore the three - dimensional nature of turbulence in a magnetized plasma , highlighting the physical behavior that is eliminated in treatments with reduced dimensionality .",
    "although our interest is the application to realistic astrophysical plasmas that demand a more sophisticated description of the turbulent dynamics , we illustrate here the inherently three - dimensional nature of plasma turbulence using the simplest case of turbulence in an incompressible mhd plasma .",
    "we contend that the incompressible mhd equations represent a minimal description of the physics underlying key aspects of plasma turbulence  the linear wave physics and nonlinear couplings that lead to the development of an anisotropic alfvnic turbulent cascade and the generation of current sheets at small scales  that persist in more comprehensive physical descriptions .",
    "consequently , the three - dimensional nature of incompressible mhd turbulence is shared by kinetic plasma turbulence .",
    "in fact , recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that , under the weakly collisional plasma conditions relevant to astrophysical environments , the nonlinear evolution of weak plasma turbulence is well described by the equations of incompressible mhd @xcite .",
    "first , we provide simple heuristic arguments for the three - dimensional nature of incompressible mhd turbulence in  [ sec : simple ] . in  [ sec : projection ] , the incompressible mhd equations are projected onto the alfvnic and pseudo - alfvnic polarizations to obtain a set of equations that highlights the four distinct nonlinearities , and their geometrical constraints , that determine the evolution of a single alfvn and pseudo - alfvn fourier mode . we evaluate the nonlinear properties of different two - dimensional limits of these equations in  [ sec:2dlimits ] , discuss the implications of these findings for the study of plasma turbulence in  [ sec : discuss ] , and present our conclusions in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "a steady - state turbulent plasma is characterized by the cascade of energy from the large scales , at which the turbulence is driven , down to the small scales , at which the turbulence is dissipated .",
    "the theoretical concept of an energy cascade is most easily understood by employing a spatial plane - wave decomposition of the turbulent fluctuations into a fourier series , in which the cascade of energy flows from wave modes with small wavenumbers ( corresponding to the large - scale motions ) to wave modes with large wavenumbers ( corresponding to the small - scale motions ) .",
    "mathematically , the turbulent transfer of energy is governed by the nonlinear terms in the system of equations .",
    "these nonlinearities determine the transfer of energy from one fourier mode to another .",
    "therefore , the mathematical properties of the nonlinear terms provide insight into the fundamental nature of plasma turbulence .",
    "the inherently three - dimensional nature of magnetized plasma turbulence can be simply illustrated by examining the properties of the linear and nonlinear terms in the incompressible mhd equations .",
    "the ideal incompressible mhd equations can be expressed in the symmetrized elsasser form @xcite , @xmath1 @xmath2 where the magnetic field is decomposed into equilibrium and fluctuating parts @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the alfvn velocity due to the equilibrium field @xmath5 , @xmath6 is total pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) , @xmath7 is mass density , and @xmath8 are the elsasser fields given by the sum and difference of the velocity fluctuation @xmath9 and the magnetic field fluctuation @xmath10 expressed in velocity units . taking the divergence of equation  ( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) , the terms on the left - hand side are zero using equation  ( [ eq : div0 ] ) , leaving the following expression for the pressure , @xmath11 where summation over repeated indices is implied .",
    "the many mathematical properties of the ideal incompressible mhd equations relevant to the study of plasma turbulence are discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "here we merely review a few properties relevant to the investigation of the three - dimensional nature of plasma turbulence .",
    "the second term on the left - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) is the _ linear term _ that governs the lowest - order response of the plasma to an applied perturbation .",
    "this response is a wave - like behavior in which the elsasser field @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) travels down ( up ) the equilibrium magnetic field , @xmath5 , at the alfvn speed , @xmath14 .",
    "henceforth , down implies the @xmath15 direction , and up implies the @xmath16 direction . for a particular plane - wave mode with wavevector @xmath17 , the incompressibility condition , equation  ( [ eq : div0 ] ) , implies that the elsasser fields have no variation along the direction of the wavevector , @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , _ the elsasser fields @xmath19 have only two nonzero components in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the wavevector @xmath20_. the two orthogonal directions that span this plane correspond to the two types of waves in an incompressible mhd plasma : alfvn waves and pseudo - alfvn waves .",
    "the direction of polarization of the alfvn waves is defined by @xmath21 , while the direction of polarization of the pseudo - alfvn waves is defined by @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , for a particular plane - wave mode defined by its wavevector @xmath23 , a natural orthonormal basis to describe the dynamics in incompressible mhd is given by @xmath24 .",
    "on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) , the first term is the _ nonlinear term _ that governs the transfer of energy among plane - wave modes , and the second term is a nonlinear pressure term that ensures incompressibility through equation  ( [ eq : press ] ) .",
    "the mathematical form of the nonlinear term implies that the nonlinear interaction is nonzero only if both @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus , for two waves to interact nonlinearly , they must propagate in opposite directions along the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "when waves are traveling in only one direction along the magnetic field , for example when @xmath27 , an arbitrary waveform @xmath28 is an exact nonlinear solution of the equations , representing a finite amplitude alfvn or pseudo - alfvn wavepacket traveling nondispersively in the @xmath29 direction @xcite .",
    "the vector form of equation  ( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) readily demonstrates that the alfvnic component of the turbulence in an incompressible mhd plasma is an inherently three - dimensional phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the linear term @xmath30 represents propagation of the alfvn waves along the equilibrium magnetic field and is nonzero only when the parallel wavenumber @xmath31 , requiring variation along the field - parallel dimension .",
    "it is easily shown @xcite that the nonlinearity arising from the interaction of counterpropagating alfvn waves is proportional to @xmath32 . in order for @xmath33 ,",
    "variation in both directions perpendicular to the magnetic field is required .",
    "this implies that both perpendicular dimensions must be included for the nonlinear term governing the interaction between counterpropagating alfvn waves to be represented properly .",
    "therefore , the variations in the direction parallel to and in both directions perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field must be represented to capture all of the physical behavior at play in magnetized plasma turbulence_the dynamics of plasma turbulence is inherently three - dimensional , and reduction of the dimensionality eliminates important physical behavior _ , as will be demonstrated in detail in the remainder of this study .",
    "although not proven here , we speculate that the manifestly three - dimensional nature of plasma turbulence not only applies to incompressible mhd plasmas , but persists as a general characteristic of the turbulence for more complex plasmas , such as compressible mhd plasmas or kinetic plasmas .",
    "in this section , we explore the evolution of incompressible mhd turbulence in terms of all possible nonlinear interactions between counterpropagating alfvn and pseudo - alfvn waves .",
    "the result illustrates clearly the inherently three - dimensional nature of incompressible mhd turbulence .      for simplicity in the following calculations ,",
    "we choose just one of the two symmetrized equations of ideal incompressible mhd given by equation  ( [ eq : elsasserpm ] ) , specifically analyzing the equation for the evolution of the elsasser field @xmath12 , @xmath35 where we have evaluated the dot product in the linear term .",
    "we consider a triply - periodic plasma volume of size @xmath36 .",
    "the possible fourier modes in the domain are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 signifies the spatial component @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or @xmath41 , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we write the general solutions for @xmath44 as discrete fourier series , @xmath45 where @xmath46 , and the second form is shorthand to simplify the notation .",
    "we can also write the total pressure @xmath47 in terms of a fourier series as well , @xmath48 henceforth , we suppress the explicit time dependence of the fourier coefficients for notational simplicity . in addition , in order for the elsasser fields to be real , all of the complex fourier coefficients must satisfy a reality condition , @xmath49 .",
    "next , we substitute the fourier series equations  ( [ eq : zpmk ] )  and  ( [ eq : pk ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : elsasserp ] ) , multiply by @xmath50 , and integrate the result @xmath51 to obtain an expression for the time evolution of a single fourier coefficient @xmath34 , @xmath52 { \\mathbf{z}}^+({\\mathbf{k } } '' ) \\delta^3({\\mathbf{k}}'+{\\mathbf{k}}''-{\\mathbf{k}})\\right\\ } -\\frac{i { \\mathbf{k } } p({\\mathbf{k}})}{\\rho_0 } \\label{eq : zkp}\\ ] ]      in this section , we decompose a general spatial fourier mode @xmath53 into its alfvnic and pseudo - alfvnic components by projection of the vector elsasser field onto the orthonormal basis @xmath54 .",
    "note that , although we refer to these fluctuations as alfvn and pseudo - alfvn waves , linearization of the equations was never performed .",
    "this projection is applicable in the fully nonlinear limit , and the results are therefore not limited to small amplitude fluctuations .",
    "since the incompressibility condition @xmath55 implies that @xmath56 , the general decomposition of the fourier coefficient is given by @xmath57 .",
    "note that the directions @xmath58 and @xmath59 are functions of the wavevector @xmath23 , so in the following calculations we employ a notational convention that uses @xmath60 and @xmath61 to denote the alfvnic and pseudo - alfvnic directions associated with a plane - wave mode with wavevector @xmath62 .",
    "projecting equation  ( [ eq : zkp ] ) onto @xmath58 yields a scalar equation for the evolution of the alfvnic component @xmath63 , @xmath64[{\\mathbf{z}}^+({\\mathbf{k}}'')\\cdot { \\mbox{$\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_a$}}]\\ ] ] where we define a shorthand notation to denote the double sum over all possible @xmath62 and @xmath65 subject to the constraint @xmath66 , @xmath67 note that the pressure term drops out upon projection for both the alfvnic or pseudo - alfvnic directions since @xmath68 and @xmath69 . splitting @xmath70 and",

    "six unique dot products appear in equations  ( [ eq : zpa ] )  and  ( [ eq : zpp ] ) : @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",

    "therefore , in the anisotropic limit , @xmath0 , the alfvn waves are dominantly responsible for mediating the nonlinear energy transfer between counterpropagating wave modes .",
    "in addition , the alfvn and pseudo - alfven waves do not exchange energy in this limit .",
    "the dominance of nonlinearities which depend only on the perpendicular gradients ( neglecting the small terms involving @xmath88 in the third nonlinear term of equation  ( [ eq : zpp_final ] ) above ) suggests the possibility that a two - dimensional treatment in the perpendicular plane ( the perpendicular 2d limit analyzed in  [ sec : perp2d ] ) may be sufficient to capture the turbulent dynamics . however , one of the main points of this study is that the perpendicular 2d limit is _ not _ sufficient , but that the reduced , yet still three - dimensional , description governed by the reduced mhd equations is a preferable choice .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : zpa_final ] ) and ( [ eq : zpp_final ] ) also demonstrate that the nonlinear energy transfer that drives the energy cascade in incompressible mhd turbulence potentially involves all possible triads of plane - wave modes that satisfy the wavevector constraint @xmath66 . for the general case of quadratic nonlinearities in fluid equations , when energy is transferred to a particular plane - wave mode with wavevector @xmath23 , the equation for the evolution of the mode",
    "@xmath23 does not uniquely determine whether the energy originated from mode @xmath62 or from mode @xmath65 or from a combination of both modes .",
    "but , in the case of the ideal incompressible mhd equations , another property of the equations can be used to determine uniquely the mode from which the energy was transferred .",
    "it can be readily demonstrated that , for the ideal incompressible mhd equations , the total energy of each of the elsasser fields @xmath101 is independently conserved @xcite , @xmath102 this property implies that the nonlinear interactions do not lead to any exchange of energy between upward and downward waves  the energy fluxes of the waves in each of these directions is conserved .",
    "therefore , since the upward waves @xmath103 or @xmath104 do not exchange energy with the downward waves @xmath63 or @xmath91 , any energy gained ( lost ) by @xmath63 or @xmath105 must have been lost ( gained ) by @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , the upward waves , whether alfvn or pseudo - alfvn waves , merely serve to mediate the energy transfer from one downward wave mode to another downward wave mode .",
    "this does not mean that the energy of an upward wave @xmath103 or @xmath108 remains constant  another equation governs the evolution of the upward wave @xmath103 or @xmath104 involving nonlinear interactions mediated by downward waves .",
    "this property can be confirmed , for example , by verifying that the transfer of energy between two downward alfvn waves , @xmath63 and @xmath106 , mediated by an upward alfvn wave @xmath109 in the complementary triad interactions @xmath66 and @xmath110 , is conservative , given by latexmath:[\\[\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial t } \\left ( |z^+_a ( { \\mathbf{k}})|^2 +      condition @xmath49 requires that all four terms above must be included to obtain this result .",
    "the nonlinear triad interactions between counterpropagating alfvn and pseudo - alfvn waves given explicitly in equations  ( [ eq : zpa_final ] )  and  ( [ eq : zpp_final ] ) govern the nonlinear energy transfer that underlies the turbulent cascade in an incompressible mhd plasma .",
    "it is important to note that one must integrate the equations for all of the fourier modes self - consistently in time to determine if any particular interaction or combination of interactions leads to a secular transfer of energy in time .",
    "the asymptotic analytical solution presented in @xcite provides an explicit example of this time integration that leads to a secular transfer of energy to smaller scales . in that weakly nonlinear case",
    ", it was shown that the interaction between two perpendicularly polarized , counterpropagating plane alfvn waves with equal and opposite values of @xmath88 and equal values of @xmath112 yields a secular transfer of energy through a combination of two triad interactions ( together comprising a _ resonant four - wave interaction _ ) : first , the two counterpropagating alfvn waves generate an intermediary , purely magnetic mode with @xmath113 ; second , the interaction of each of the original alfvn waves with that @xmath113 intermediary transfers energy to a third alfvn wave with higher @xmath112 traveling in the same direction as the original wave .    although the determination of whether a particular nonlinear triad interaction yields a net transfer of energy requires performing such a challenging self - consistent time integration of all modes , one may simply rule out the contribution of a particular nonlinear interaction if the geometric factors contained in the brackets equations  ( [ eq : zpa_final ] )  and  ( [ eq : zpp_final ] ) are zero .",
    "indeed , it is these geometric factors involving the wavevectors @xmath62 and @xmath65 that highlight the elimination , under reduced dimensionality , of many of the four distinct nonlinearities responsible for the energy cascade in incompressible mhd turbulence .",
    "here we analyze the limits of equations  ( [ eq : zpa_final ] )  and  ( [ eq : zpp_final ] ) in several two - dimensional limits that are often used for numerical studies plasma turbulence .",
    "the two most widely used cases are the ( i ) _ perpendicular 2d limit _ , in which the equilibrium magnetic field is perpendicular to the two - dimensional plane of the simulation , and the ( ii ) _ in - plane 2d limit _ , in which the equilibrium magnetic field is contained within the two - dimensional plane of the simulation .",
    "a few studies have employed the ( iii ) _",
    "oblique 2d limit _ , in which the equilibrium magnetic field is inclined by a small angle from the normal to the two - dimensional plane of the simulation .      in this limit",

    ", there is no component of the wavevector parallel to the equilibrium magnetic field , @xmath116 .",

    "we discuss the implications of these limitations on the physical behavior of incompressible mhd turbulence in the perpendicular 2d limit .    in an incompressible mhd plasma ,",
    "magnetic tension is the restoring force that couples the magnetic field and velocity fluctuations and leads to wave propagation of the elsasser fields , @xmath101 , along the equilibrium magnetic field . without the possibility of any variation along the equilibrium magnetic field ( when @xmath123 , as implied by the perpendicular 2d limit ) , there is no restoring force , and therefore no wave behavior , only fluctuations within the perpendicular 2d plane .",
    "note that the response governed by the linear term is the lowest - order , fundamental response of the plasma to any perturbation that varies along the field , and it is entirely absent in the perpendicular 2d limit ; in fact , there is no dynamical evolution at all without the nonlinear term . in this limit",
    ", the elsasser fields @xmath101 lose the physical meaning that they represent finite - amplitude waveforms that travel up or down the equilibrium magnetic field .",
