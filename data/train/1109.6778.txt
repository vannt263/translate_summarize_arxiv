    "one of the most fundamental predictions of the simplest standard , single field , slow - roll inflationary cosmology , is that the primordial density fluctuations , that seeded the formation of the large - scale structure we see today , were nearly gaussian distributed ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "such prediction seems to be in good agreement with current observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( e.g. @xcite ) and large - scale structure ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , a significant , potentially observable level of non - gaussianity may be produced in some inflationary models where any of the conditions that give rise to the standard single - field , slow - roll inflation fail .",
    "the detection of primordial non - gaussianities would decrease considerably the number of viable inflationary models , and it would give us an insight on key physical processes that took place in the early universe . such detection",
    "could be achieved through the statistical characterization of the properties of the large - scale structure , namely the bispectrum and/or trispectrum of the galaxy distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) , or the determination of the evolution with time of the abundance of massive collapsed objects such as galaxy clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "these form at high peaks of the density field @xmath0 and their number density as a function of redshift depends on the growth of structure , thus being sensitive to the dynamics and energy content of the universe and to the statistical properties of the primordial density fluctuations .    in this work ,",
    "we address the issue of how primordial non - gaussianities may affect the determination of the effective dark energy equation of state @xmath1 using the evolution with time of the galaxy cluster abundance . throughout , and unless stated otherwise , we consider our fiducial cosmological model to be a flat @xmath2cdm model with wmap 7-year cosmological parameters ( wmap+bao+@xmath3 ) @xcite , namely , a hubble constant , @xmath3 , equal to @xmath4 with @xmath5 , fractional densities of matter and baryons today of @xmath6 , @xmath7 respectively , a scalar spectral index , @xmath8 , equal to 0.963 , and we normalize the power spectrum so that @xmath9 .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity is commonly parametrized by the non - linear parameter @xmath10 and may be written as follows @xcite ,    @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the primordial curvature perturbation and @xmath14 is an auxiliar function that contains the shape of the bispectrum , @xmath15 , of @xmath13 .",
    "further , @xmath16 is the dimensionless power - spectrum , while @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the wave vectors . in fourier space , the functions @xmath19 and @xmath15 are defined by means of the two and three - point correlation functions ,    @xmath20    @xmath21    where @xmath22 .",

    "the bispectrum of @xmath13 is the lowest order statistics sensitive to non - gaussian features .",
    "depending on the underlying physical mechanism responsible for generating non - gaussianities , different triangular configurations ( shapes ) will arise .",
    "there are broadly four classes of triangular shapes or , equivalently , four different bispectrum parametrizations can be found in the literature : local , equilateral , folded and orthogonal . here",
    "we shall only consider the first two .",
    "they are defined as follows :    * * local shape * : it arises from multi - field , inhomogeneous reheating , curvaton and ekpyrotic models .",
    "mathematically , the local shape can be characterized by a simple taylor expansion around the gaussian curvature perturbation , @xmath23 , @xcite , @xmath24 the wmap 7-year estimate for @xmath25 is @xcite @xmath26 the bispectrum for this shape can be derived using eq .",

    "( [ 2point_function ] ) and ( [ 3point_corr ] ) will be of special relevance in the next section , since in order to incorporate non - gaussian initial conditions in the prediction of rare objects , one has to derive a non - gaussian probability density function ( pdf ) for the smoothed density field , @xmath32 .",

    "figure [ figure1c ] shows how the cluster number density is affected when a constant dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath1 is changed for the same mass threshold , always assuming gaussian initial conditions .",

    "we have generated mock catalogues with the expected redshift evolution of the cluster number density for different non - gaussian initial conditions in bins of redshift with width @xmath77 up to redshift @xmath78,assuming a mass threshold of @xmath79 and a nearly full sky survey area of 40,000 square degrees .",
    "we further consider @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively for thelocal and equilateral parametrizations mentioned in section [ section_2 ] .",
    "the reason for choosing these specific values for @xmath10 will become clear in the next subsection .",
    "having generated the mock catalogues with the expected redshift distribution of the number density of galaxy clusters with non - gaussian initial conditions , we then computed an effective dark energy equation of state , @xmath82 , using eq .",

    "thus , the effective dark energy equation of state , @xmath84 , is defined as the value of @xmath1 which reproduces the number of clusters of the mock non - gaussian catalogue in _ i - th _ redshift bin .",
    "the normalization of the power - spectrum , for models with non - gaussian initial conditions , was done by demanding the present - day number density of galaxy clusters in the concordance model ( @xmath2cdm cosmology with gaussian initial conditions and @xmath9 ) is recovered .",

    "figures [ figure2c ] and [ figure2d ] show the reconstructed dark energy equation of state , @xmath82 , as a function of the redshift for @xmath86 and different values of @xmath10 ( local and equilateral parametrizations , respectively ) . at low redshift",
    ", our reconstructed @xmath82 is very close to our fiducial @xmath74 .",
    "but , as we move towards higher redshifts , our computed @xmath82 deviates from @xmath87 , with this effect being more evident for higher values of @xmath10 in both parametrizations .",
    "further , for @xmath88 there is a redshift interval where @xmath82 , is undefined , which widens with increasing @xmath10 . for @xmath86",
    "this happens in a redshift range centered at the redshift @xmath89 , at which the value of @xmath82 , which we will call @xmath90 , that maximizes the cluster abundance is equal to @xmath87 ( see figure [ figure2a ] ) . in this interval , there is no @xmath82 that solves eq .",
    "( [ w_determination ] ) , since the product of the comoving volume with the integral of the mass function , when assuming gaussian initial conditions , is always smaller than the same quantity for non - gaussian initial conditions , i.e. @xmath91 . if our fiducial cosmological model had a different value for @xmath1 , then the discontinuity would appear at the redshift at which @xmath92 . on the other hand , for models with @xmath93 , we have also a discontinous @xmath82 but there are two values of @xmath82 capable of reproducing the number of clusters in non - gaussian models in a small redshift interval centered at @xmath94 . the dependence of the value of @xmath95 on the mass threshold @xmath67 is shown in figure [ figure2b ] .",
    "the observational estimation of the number density of galaxy clusters is affected by two sources of statistical uncertainty : the shot - noise and the cosmic variance ( e.g. ) . the statistical uncertainty associated with the former increases , for example , with the cluster mass threshold , as clusters then become more rare , while the statistical uncertainty associated with the later increases , for example , as the cosmic volume surveyed gets smaller . however , assuming primordial gaussian density perturbations , and for a cluster mass threshold above @xmath96 , it has been shown that the magnitude of the contribution of the cosmic variance to the statistical uncertainty , in the observed number density of galaxy clusters , is always at least an order of magnitude smaller than the contribution due to shot - noise , almost independently of the surveyed sky area ( e.g. see figures 5 and 9 of ) .",
    "the existence of statistical uncertainties in the observed number density of galaxy clusters will to some extent mask the apparent discontinuity on the evolution of @xmath82 described in the previous section , which could be used to identify the presence of non - gaussian density perturbations . in order to determine the impact of such uncertainties , we will re - estimate @xmath82 in similar fashion to what was done in the previous section , but with the inclusion of shot - noise , @xmath97 , at the @xmath98 level in each redshift bin .",
    "we are able to neglect the contribution from cosmic variance by setting the cluster mass threshold to @xmath96 , and noting that the assumed level of non - gaussianity is relatively small , not affecting much the average number density of galaxy clusters with respect to the gaussian case ( see fig .",
    "figures [ figure4 ] and [ figure5 ] show the @xmath98 statistical uncertainty in the reconstructed @xmath82 , as a function of redshift , when shot - noise is taken into account , and as before for a nearly full sky survey area of 40,000 square degrees . as can be seen , even when including the effect of such uncertainty , the apparent discontinuity on the evolution of @xmath82 found in the previous subsection is still present ( at least at the 2@xmath99 confidence level ) for values of @xmath10 as small as @xmath100 for the local parametrization , and @xmath101 for the equilateral parametrization .",
    "clearly , decreasing the survey area would mean that only values of @xmath10 with larger modulus could be detected .",
    "in this work , we investigated whether the presence of primordial non - gaussianities has an impact on the estimation of the effective dark energy equation of state , when one uses the abundance of galaxy clusters as a tool to probe different cosmological scenarios .",
    "we computed the effective dark energy equation of state , @xmath82 per redshift bin , assuming gaussian initial conditions , that is capable of reproducing the galaxy cluster counts expected in several non - gaussian models , thus constructing a correspondence @xmath102 for each redshift bin .",
    "the most important result of this work is the discovery of a redshift interval where no value for the effective dark energy equation of state is capable of reproducing the non - gaussian cluster abundance for models with @xmath88 , which is the result of there being a @xmath82 that maximizes the cluster number density at each redshift , while for models with @xmath93 a discontinuous @xmath82 is obtained .",
    "the appearance of such type of features may thus constitute a new diagnostic of the presence of primordial non - gaussianities .",
    "although , even under the ideal situation where only statistical uncertainties are present , their detection is only possible for values of @xmath10 not too far away from those permitted by analysis of the wmap 7-year data @xcite , it should be remembered that @xmath10 may not be invariant with scale . in particular , there is nt any particular reason why @xmath10 could not increase as the scale diminishes ( see e.g. @xcite ) ."
