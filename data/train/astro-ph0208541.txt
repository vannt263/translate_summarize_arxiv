    "recent surveys have provided tantalizing evidence that galaxy mergers at high redshift may be the precursors of local massive , quiescent galaxies .",
    "the fraction of both optically - selected mergers and submillimeter / infrared- selected galaxies ( the latter of which are observed locally to be mergers : e.g. joseph & wright 1985 ) has been shown to increase with increasing redshift ( patton et al .",
    "1997 ; smail et al .",
    "1997 ; barger et al . 1998 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; le fvre et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the space density of the high - redshift submillimeter population is observed to be similar to the space density of present day massive elliptical galaxies ( trentham 2001 ) .",
    "further , n - body simulations have shown that the collision of disk galaxies naturally leads to the formation of massive elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "given the likely connection between galaxy mergers and massive elliptical galaxy formation , reconstruction of the evolutionary steps  beginning with the initial interaction of the progenitors and ending with the final merger byproduct  will permit a determination of how the activity and dynamical state of galaxy mergers , and thus of massive galaxies , evolve as a function of evolutionary phase .",
    "molecular gas is a key ingredient in the merger process ; n - body simulations employing a dissipational gas component ( i.e. , barnes & hernquist 1996 ; mihos & hernquist 1996 ) show that gas in the spiral disks of the progenitor galaxies is gravitationally torqued , resulting in either stripping of gas from the disk , or a net inflow of material to the circumnuclear regions of each progenitor .",
    "multiwavelength observations of advanced infrared luminous mergers provide evidence that the enhanced molecular gas densities lead to prodigious star formation and , in some cases , mass accretion onto supermassive nuclear black holes occurs ( see review by sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "the scenario presented above has been assembled from both theoretical and empirical work .",
    "however , observational gaps exist , and feedback mechanisms ( i.e. , star formation , supernovae winds ) are not understood well enough to implement in simulations . in order to fill in the observational details regarding the role of molecular gas in the intermediate evolutionary stages of the most luminous mergers , a co survey of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( uligs : @xmath14 \\gtrsim 10^{12}$]l@xmath2 ) with double nuclei and @xmath15 has been initiated .",
    "these observations make use of the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array to resolve co emission that may be associated with each nucleus .",
    "this sample of uligs has been well - studied at other wavelengths ( e.g. , condon et al . 1991 , 1992 ; murphy et al . 1996 , 2001 ; sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ; sanders et al .",

    "in addition , limits can be placed on the column densities toward co - detected nuclei and the gas mass density , which allow for a discussion of extinction in uligs and their possible association with stellar core formation in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. kormendy & sanders 1992 ) .",

    "section 6 contains a discussion of the molecular properties of each nucleus in comparison with the optical / near - infrared and radio emission lines , determinations of the star formation rate and the column density , and comparisons of the gas mass density to the stellar densities of elliptical galaxy cores .",

    "four criteria for galaxies in the sample must be met in order to achieve the desired science goals .",
    "first , there must be sufficient information obtained at other wavelengths to show that they are strongly interacting merger pairs .",
    "second , the nuclei must be far enough apart such that the progenitors are recognizable as separate galaxies .",
    "third , the progenitors must also be far enough apart so that co(1@xmath190 ) emission possibly present in the nuclei of both progenitors would be resolvable with ovro ( i.e , projected separations @xmath20 ) .",
    "fourth , the mergers must be well - studied at other wavelengths so that additional information ( radio interferometry , optical spectroscopy , optical - to - infrared imaging ) are available .    among the complete sample of 21 uligs from the iras bright galaxy sample ( bgs , with 60 @xmath21 m flux densities , @xmath22 jy : soifer et al . 1987 ) selected by sanders et al .",

    "thus , the ratio of the h@xmath52 mass and the co luminosity is given by    @xmath53 , \\eqno(4)\\ ] ]    where @xmath54h@xmath55 and @xmath56 are the density of h@xmath52 and brightness temperature for the co(1@xmath190 ) transition ( scoville & sanders 1987 ; solomon , downes , & radford 1992 ) .",

    "1993 ) have shown that hotter clouds tend to be denser such that the density and temperature dependencies cancel each other .",
    "the variation in the value of @xmath57 is approximately a factor of 2 for a wide range of kinetic temperatures , gas densities , and co abundance ( e.g. @xmath58 [ k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath59^{-1}$ ] : radford , solomon , & downes 1991 ) .",
    "solomon et al . (",
    "1997 ) and downes & solomon ( 1998 ) have made use of dynamical mass estimates of a low - redshift infrared galaxy sample observed in co with the plateau de bure interferometer to argue that @xmath57 may , in some cases , be as low as 1 @xmath60 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath61 .    in order to determine an appropriate value of @xmath57 for the present sample of galaxies , the assumption will be made that the mass of the inner region of each galaxy is primarily comprised of molecular gas .",

    "given that the co emission associated with each nucleus was not resolved with the ovro observations ( figure 13 ) , @xmath65 is estimated in two ways .",
    "first , the assumption is made that the molecular gas is similar in extent to the radio emission ( condon et al .",
    "1991 : table 5 ) ; this is plausible given that the radio emission may , with the exception of iras 13451 + 1232 and mrk 463 ( see  6.2 ) , be due to supernovae from star formation that has been fueled by the molecular gas ( hereafter , size estimate 1 ) .",
    "second , the co extent is estimated by assuming optically thick , thermalized gas with a unity filling factor and a blackbody temperature , @xmath66 , equal to that of the dust ( hereafter , size estimate 2 ) . given the latter assumption , @xmath66 can be determined using the 60@xmath4 and 100@xmath4 flux densities    @xmath67 ~[{\\rm k } ] \\eqno(6)\\ ] ]    ( see discussion in solomon et al .",
    "thus , the radius of the co distribution is calculated via    @xmath68 \\eqno(7)\\ ] ]    ( see table 5 ) .",
    "the sizes estimated via these two methods are with a factor of 24 of each other , with the size estimate 1 yielding smaller co extents . adopting the more conservative co extent determined from size estimate 2 yields @xmath69 m@xmath2 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath61 with a mean value of 1.6 m@xmath2 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath61 .",
    "these values are similar to @xmath70 m@xmath2 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath61 derived by solomon et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a sample of 37 uligs ; the average of their sample is 1.3 m@xmath2 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath61 .",
    "we adopt @xmath57 of 1.5 m@xmath2 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath61 , which is lower by a factor of 3 than the value determined for the bulk of the molecular gas in the disk of the milky way ( scoville & sanders 1987 ; strong et al .",
    "the derived molecular gas masses are listed in table 4 .",
    "the data presented in figures 13 clearly illustrate the advantage of these new observations .",
    "the beam size is a factor of 1030 smaller than previous single - dish co observations of these double - nucleus galaxies ( sanders , scoville , & soifer 1991 ; alloin et al .",
    "1992 ; sanders et al . 1993 ; solomon et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the improved resolution is sufficient to determine the location of the co emission relative to both the stellar distribution and radio emission (  4 ) .",
    "the beam size is also sufficient to show that the upper limit of the co extent of each nucleus ( 2.14.4 kpc ) is significantly less than the average effective co diameter of @xmath71 kpc determined for a sample of @xmath72 nearby spiral galaxies ( young et al .",
    "1995 ; see also evans , surace , & mazzarella 2000 ) .",
    "this latter comparison may be an indication that the molecular gas in the progenitor galaxies , most of which appear to be spiral galaxies based on the presence of spiral and/or tidal features ( figures 13 ; see also figure 1 of evans , surace , & mazzarella 2000 ) , has already been driven inwards via the gravitational interaction of the galaxy pairs .",
    "the most obvious characteristic of these data is that not all of the nuclei of these intermediate - stage uligs are detected in co(@xmath0 ) .",
    "this issue has been previously discussed ; evans et al .",
    "( 1999 ) presented co observations of the warm ulig iras 13451 + 1232 which show molecular gas to be only detected in radio - loud agn nucleus , and previous co observations of the cool uligs arp 220 and iras 14348 - 1447 show molecular gas associated with both nuclei ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1999 ; evans , surace , & mazzarella 2000 ) . the new data presented here for the additional galaxies support that general trend ; both of the warm uligs ( iras 08572 + 3915 and mrk 463 ) have molecular gas detected only on the redder , radio luminous nucleus , whereas molecular gas is detected on both nuclei of the cool ulig iras 12112 + 0305 .",
    "this effect is not entirely due to differences in the sensitivities of the observations ; two of the three warm uligs ( iras 08572 + 3915 and mrk 463 ) are the closest objects in the sample , and their undetected nuclei have @xmath73 upper limits that are a factor of 3.67.5 less than the co luminosities of the least co luminous cool galaxy nucleus ( iras 12112 + 0305sw ) . in terms of molecular gas mass , iras 08572 + 3915se and mrk 463w",
    "have molecular gas masses a factor of 3.06.2 less than that of the milky way galaxy ( @xmath74 \\sim 2.5\\times10 ^ 9 $ ] m@xmath2 ) .",
    "note , however , that while the single - dish and ovro observations yield comparable flux values , consistent with the possibility that the molecular gas is associated only with the more radio luminous nucleus , it can not be ruled out in the cases of iras 13451 + 1232 and mrk 463 that their galaxy pairs have @xmath73 ratios similar to that of the cool ultraluminous galaxy pairs ( see table 6 ) .",
    "the wealth of multiwavelength data available for this sample make it possible to explore correlations between the molecular gas and both the activity occuring in each nucleus and the estimated stellar masses .",
    "in addition , simple assumptions about the true extent of the molecular gas will be made to derive crude determinations of the column density and gas mass density of the detected nuclei .",
    "these issues , and their relevance to uligs , will be explored for the majority of the discussion section .",
    "table 1 contains a compilation of the optical emission line classifications of each nucleus ( where available ) .",
    "such diagnostics have been used over the past two decades to classify galaxies as seyfert galaxies , low ionization and nuclear emission region galaxies ( liners ) , and hii - region like galaxies .",
    "the seyfert and hii region - like classification are indicative of agn and starburst activity , respectively , whereas the liner classification may be due to shocks produced by either an agn with a shallow power law , or by supernovae events .",
    "extensive studies of uligs and luminous infrared galaxies ( ligs : @xmath75 l@xmath2 ) show that the fraction of hii region - like galaxies decreases with increasing infrared luminosity , the fraction of seyfert galaxies increases , and the fraction of liners stays roughly constant ( e.g. , kim & sanders 1998 ) .",
    "both seyfert nuclei ( classified as type 2 optically , but type 1 via polarized or infrared emission : e.g. , veilleux , kim & sanders 1997 ) contain copious amounts of molecular gas , whereas only 4 of the 6 liner nuclei have detected co. this is in contrast to what has been observed in dynamically young , widely separated ( i.e. , @xmath76 kpc ) uligs ( trung et al . 2001 ) in which all seyfert and liner nuclei in their sample have @xmath77 m@xmath2 of molecular gas m@xmath2 ( k km s@xmath9 pc@xmath78)@xmath9 . ]",
    "associated with them . if indeed the galaxies identified by trung et al .",
    "are components of ultraluminous mergers , then either there is a difference between uligs comprised of widely separated galaxy pairs and intermediate stage uligs ( e.g. , gas may be stripped from one of the galaxies after the initial encounter and transferred to its companion as the merger progresses , thus leaving some relatively low - luminosity liner nuclei gas - poor ) , or the samples are statistically too small to derive firm conclusions .",
    "another obvious avenue to explore is a possible correlation between the amount of molecular gas and the strength of optical and near - infrared emission lines . in other words",
    ", it is reasonable to expect that emission lines associated with the gas - rich nuclei are more luminous because there is more gas present to fuel more vigorous activity .",
    "recombination lines of hydrogen such as paschen @xmath57 and h@xmath57 are suitable for such a comparison ; these photons are a direct probe of ionizing photons from young , massive stars and agn .",
    "paschen @xmath57 measurements exist for both nuclei of iras 08572 + 3915 , iras 12112 + 0305 , and iras 14348 - 1447 ( for the others , only pa@xmath57 data of the radio - loud agn nuclei are published ) and the ratio of pa@xmath57 flux density of nuclei in the uligs sample are tabulated along with co flux density ratios in table 6 . with the exception of iras 12112 + 0305 , the data appear to confirm that , at 1.9@xmath4 , more luminous line emission is associated with more molecular gas . the h@xmath57 measurements ( table 6 ) , which suffer @xmath79 magnitudes more extinction than pa@xmath57 and are thus less reliable indicators of relative nuclear activity , are also consistent with this result .",
    "another tracer of activity in galaxies is radio continuum emission . in galaxies , it is primarily due to synchrotron emission from agn or supernovae . in the latter case ,",
    "the emission is an indication of recent high - mass star formation ( i.e. , stars with masses @xmath80 m@xmath2 , which live @xmath81 years : condon 1992 ) .",
    "two of the galaxy pairs ( mrk 463 and iras 13451 + 1232 ) in the sample clearly have radio emission due to an agn ; the emission is in the form of radio jets emanating from the nuclear region ( e.g. mazzarella et al .",
    "1991 ; stanghellini et al .",
    "the remaining three galaxy pairs have fairly compact radio emission ( condon et al . 1990 , 1991 ) , with upper limit sizes on the order of 100 - 200 pc .    the uligs iras 14348 - 1447 and iras 12112",
    "+ 0305 are the only two uligs for which both nuclei are detected in co and for which no obvious evidence of radio emission due to agn presently exists .",
    "as is the case with the optical / near - infrared line emission , more luminous radio emission is associated with more molecular gas .",
    "it is commonly asserted that ultraluminous infrared galaxies are created by the merger of equal - mass disk galaxies . in order to estimate the relative masses of galaxies in each ultraluminous galaxy pair",
