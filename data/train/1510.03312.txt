    "such systems are generally found to have either a newtonian rheology , with pressure @xmath0 and shear stress @xmath1 proportional to @xmath8 , or a bagnoldian rheology @xcite , with @xmath9 .",
    "it has been argued recently @xcite that it is the particular mechanism of energy dissipation in the system which determines which of these two rheologies a given system will display .    for a system with newtonian rheology",
    "we can define the viscous transport coefficients , @xmath10 , @xmath11 . for a system with bagnoldian rheology we can define the bagnold transport coefficients , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "these transport coefficients characterize the global rheological response to shearing . in the limit of sufficiently small @xmath8 below jamming , these transport coefficients by definition",
    "become independent of @xmath8 @xcite , and hence depend only on the particle packing fraction @xmath7 .",
    "we will refer to this limit of sufficiently small @xmath8 as the  hard - core \" limit .    upon increasing the packing fraction @xmath7 to a critical value @xmath4 ,",
    "such granular systems undergo a shear - driven _ jamming _",
    "transition @xcite from a liquid to a rigid - but - disordered solid state . in the hard - core limit , this transition is characterized by a divergence of the transport coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 for newtonian , @xmath17 for bagnoldian ) . for soft - core particles above the jamming transition ,",
    "these transport coefficients diverge as @xmath18 , reflecting the existence of a finite yield stress in the solid state .    for _ frictionless _",
    "particles , the jamming transition is generally believed to be continuous . in the hard - core limit ,",
    "transport coefficients diverge as a power - law of the distance from jamming , @xmath19 , as @xmath7 increases to @xmath4 from below . for soft - core particles",
    "a critical scaling theory , in analogy with phase transitions in equilibrium systems , has been used @xcite to give a unified description of the critical behavior of rheology as a function of both @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the neighborhood of the jamming transition .",
    "the goal of the present work is to numerically simulate a simple granular model that displays bagnoldian rheology ( @xmath17 ) , and carry out a scaling analysis of the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath1 to determine the critical exponent @xmath2 , and related critical parameters .",
    "we emphasis that when we refer to the _ critical exponent _",
    "@xmath2 , we mean the exponent that characterizes the true algebraic divergence _ asymptotically _ close to the athermal jamming critical point , i.e. @xmath6 , @xmath20 , @xmath18 . while this asymptotic region may be small ( and indeed the present work argues it is ) , it is of fundamental interest because analogy with equilibrium critical phenomena leads one to expect that this asymptotic exponent @xmath2 is _ universal _ , i.e. independent of microscopic details @xcite .",
    "determining the numerical value of @xmath2 then allows one to test competing theoretical models which make specific predictions for behavior in this asymptotic region about the critical point .    to determine the critical exponent @xmath2",
    ", it will be necessary to test that the data used in the analysis is indeed in the asymptotic critical region .",
    "if one fits to numerical or experimental data that lies outside this true asymptotic critical region , one is liable to find only _ effective _ values of the exponent that may vary depending on the range of data considered ( as will be shown in figs .",
    "[ fitparams ] and [ fitparams2 ] ) , or may depend on other microscopic details .",
    "thus , in determining @xmath2 from data fitting or scaling collapses , it is essential to check the self consistency of the resulting value of @xmath2 ( and other fitting parameters ) by varying the window of data used in the fit , shrinking it ever closer to the critical point to see if parameter values are systematically changing or if they remain stable .",
    "without such a test , the value of @xmath2 obtained from such an analysis is likely to be unreliable , even though the fit may seem very good ( as will be illustrated in our fig .",

    "very few of the prior works in the literature carry out such a test . here",
    "we will show that , although we go to quite low shear strain rates @xmath8 , comparable or smaller than other prior works , we can not get close enough to the critical point so that a leading scaling analysis gives self - consistent results ; rather it becomes necessary to include the next leading _",
    "correction - to - scaling _ term to arrive at consistent numerical values of the critical parameters , as we have earlier found for systems with newtonian rheology @xcite .",
    "although we expect that @xmath2 should be universal for a given class of rheology , we do not expect @xmath2 to be the same for newtonian systems ( @xmath16 ) as for bagnoldian systems ( @xmath17 ) , and prior works @xcite are consistent with that . for systems with newtonian rheology ,",

    "numerical simulations @xcite , carried out by varying @xmath7 in a constant volume ensemble , have reported values of @xmath2 somewhat smaller than @xmath31 , but seem perhaps to be approaching this prediction as the window of data analyzed shrinks closer to the jamming critical point .",
    "however , simulations by peyneau and roux @xcite , using an ensemble at constant normal pressure , found significantly different results , equivalent to a value of @xmath32 .",
    "recent theoretical work by deguili et al .",

    "we carry out a careful scaling analysis of the critical behavior of the bagnold coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so as to try to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "we use the same model of massive frictionless disks as in earlier studies @xcite , with a dissipation proportional to the normal component of the velocity difference between particles in contact , such as is known to result in bagnoldian rheology .",
    "our simulations are carried out varying @xmath7 and @xmath8 , shearing the system at constant volume .",
