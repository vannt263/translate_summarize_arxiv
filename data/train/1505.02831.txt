    "@xcite have been some of the most successful .",
    "the logic of such models is that , ultimately , one wants to find an approximation @xmath2 to the joint probability distribution @xmath3 of the observed multivariate data @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",

    ", the maxent approximation @xmath10 is @xcite : @xmath17 here every constrained correlation function gets a term in the exponent , @xmath18 is the partition function , and the lagrange multipliers @xmath19 must be chosen to satisfy the constraints .",
    "this is generally not an analytically solvable problem , and even numerics are hard @xcite .",
    "equation  ( [ qgeneral ] ) has the form of the ising spin problem , allowing a wholesale import of intuition from statistical physics to maxent data analysis .",
    "correspondingly , these ideas have been applied to many biological systems in the last decade @xcite , starting with neurophysiological recordings from salamander retina @xcite .",
    "there @xmath6 was a few dozen neurons , and @xmath20 corresponded to the @xmath21th neuron spiking / not spiking at a certain time .",
    "a surprising result was that truncating eq .",
    "( [ qgeneral ] ) at the quadratic order in @xmath22 ( or , in other words , constraining @xmath10 up to pairwise correlations ) provided a good fit to @xmath7 .",
    "we will refer to this finding as _ pairwise sufficiency _ from now on .",
    "the pairwise sufficiency was later found in other neural systems @xcite ( though it is violated at larger @xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "it was observed further for natural images @xcite ; for discrete , yet non - binary @xmath23 in sequencing data @xcite ; and for real - valued velocities of birds in flocking experiments @xcite .",
    "even for some non - maxent approaches , similar findings were also reported @xcite .",
    "one can interprete these observations in the context of biological systems operating in a special regime @xcite .",
    "however , the wide applicability of the findings suggests an alternative : pairwise sufficiency may emerge for a wide class of biological and non - biological networks _",
    "generically_. indeed , sparse sampling of variables in experiments is similar to decimation in statistical physics , and the resulting renormalization group - like flow may decrease the importance of the higher order couplings @xcite .",
    "further , in a perturbative regime , where fluctuations away from the independence are small , the pairwise sufficiency also appears @xcite .",
    "here we propose one more possibility , arguing that the pairwise sufficiency arises naturally in _ strongly coupled _ multivariate systems .    in",
    "what follows , we first introduce the idea in an intuitive toy model , and then develop it numerically by analyzing randomly generated networks .",
    "we show that the pairwise maxent models approximate such random networks surprisingly well .",
    "further , we explore distributions of states of these networks and their models , leading to an explanation of the pairwise sufficiency .",
    "finally , we discuss why diverse biological systems may find themselves in the pairwise - sufficient regime , but we live it for the future to investigate if this mechanism is responsible for the sufficiency in experimental networks .",
    "for a tractable example of emergence of the pairwise sufficiency , we focus on boolean gates .",
    "these are the limit of ising spin networks in the low temperature ( strong coupling ) regime @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath24 can be written as @xmath25 $ ] with @xmath26 .",
    "if also @xmath27 , then @xmath28 . thus the joint probability distribution for or has the pairwise maxent form , eq .  ( [ qgeneral ] )",
    "similarly , for @xmath26 , @xmath29 is equivalent to @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "this is again a pairwise maxent distribution .",
    "however , @xmath31 , is equivalent to @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "this is an example of a purely third - order gate , with no pairwise contributions to its maxent representation .    in fig  [ xors ] , we now couple of a few such third - order gates to each other .",
    "the spins @xmath34 are connected by an xor ( left column , first row ) , and there is no simpler effective representation of the network ( right column , first row ) .",
    "we then add the fourth spin , @xmath35 ( left column , second row ) .",
    "however , then @xmath36 .",
    "this can be represented as an effective model @xmath37 , @xmath26 .",
    "thus the third order xor interaction is equivalent to a pairwise equal interaction ( right column , second row ) .",
    "the latter is effective and nonlocal , in the sense that @xmath38 is coupled to @xmath39 , with which it does not interact in the true model .",
    "we further add @xmath40 ( third row ) , and this is equivalent to an effective model @xmath41 . in short , of the three third order interactions , each constraining one spin and hence `` carrying '' 1 bit of information , two can be represented without any error as pairwise interactions .",
    "now the network can exist in four distinct global states out of @xmath42 , determined by @xmath43 ( namely , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 ) .",
    "thus it is far from the perturbative regime of ref .",
    "we can grow the network further so that each new spin is coupled by a third order interaction to two existing spins .",
    "then the number of spins , @xmath6 , and the number of interactions , @xmath48 , are related as @xmath49 , and all but one third order interaction can be represented as a second order one . in other words , an effective pairwise model has an error of only @xmath50 when accounting for the statistics of the network states .",
    "alternatively , we can add more xors without adding new nodes .",
    "this may be inconsistent or redundant with already existing couplings . or in a case such as @xmath51 ( fourth row ) , this sets @xmath52 ( thus adding the bias , or the first order term ) , and all other spins are equal to each other , so that the pairwise effective model is exact . finally , adding @xmath53 sets every spin to -1 , and makes even the first - order model exact ( bottom row ) .",
    "we see that a network of xors can exhibit the pairwise sufficiency nonperturbatively .",
    "of course , more realistic physical or biological systems are stochastic ( @xmath54 ) , and such simple arguments will not work .",
    "however , the example suggests that effective pairwise models can approximate more complex networks well when nodes in the network interact strongly and densely , and the space of network states is sufficiently constrained . in such cases , there are many pairs of nodes that are relatively strongly correlated simply by chance , allowing replacement of higher order interactions with pairwise ones . in what follows",
    ", we will develop this intuition further using numerical studies .      to verify our intuition , we proceed by generating random networks that have _ only _ higher order nondeterministic interactions among spins ( @xmath0-spin models , @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "we then quantify the accuracy with which lower order maxent models approximate these networks .",
    "we explore networks with @xmath55 to ensure that our findings do not depend on the exact structure of the true higher order interactions .",
    "further , systems with only fourth order couplings have the @xmath56 symmetry , and thus can not include any first order terms in their maxent approximations , eq .",
    "( [ qgeneral ] ) . studying them will allow us to understand if the eventual freezing to a single well - defined state , as in the last row of fig .",
    "[ xors ] , is crucial for the pairwise sufficiency , or if it emerges even for nonperturbative networks with more than one highly probable state .    to generate the random networks , we first specify @xmath6 , the number of nodes , and @xmath48 the number of interactions . then for each interaction @xmath57",
    ", we generate its coupling constant @xmath58 from a zero - mean gaussian distribution with a certain variance @xmath59 .",
    "we then choose three or four spins at random to couple .",
    "the overall probability of states for these networks is @xmath60 where @xmath61 , so that the spins do not self - interact . to specify these distributions ( and later",
    "calculate various errors of approximations ) , we need to know @xmath18 . to decouple studying the problem of the pairwise sufficiency from a hard problem of efficient sampling , we focus on @xmath62 , which allows us to estimate @xmath18 by direct summation fast enough to do it many times and collect statistics .",
    "we generate many such distributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 , every time picking random @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 $ ] , and @xmath67 $ ] .    for each generated distribution , we estimate its individual and pairwise marginals @xmath68 , @xmath69 for all @xmath70 by direct marginalization ( hereafter we drop subscripts 3 or 4 for @xmath7 if it does not cause confusion ) .",
    "we then calculate the first order ( or independent ) maxent approximation @xmath71    next we fit the pairwise maxent model @xmath72 to @xmath7 . while good algorithms exist for this purpose @xcite , it is unclear if their assumptions are satisfied by our networks .",
    "trying again to decouple the problems of efficient inference and the pairwise sufficiency , we choose a classic , well understood iterative proportional fitting procedure ( ipfp ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "that is , we start with @xmath73 as a guess for @xmath72 , calculate @xmath74 , and redefine @xmath75 we cycle through all pairs @xmath76 , and iterate until @xmath77 up to a relative error of @xmath78 .",
    "this is achieved within @xmath79 iterations depending on how close the final @xmath72 is to @xmath73 .",
    "we verified that starting with different initial conditions results in the same solution , as it should .    to measure the quality of the maxent models , we calculate the kullback - leibler ( kl ) divergence between the true distribution @xmath80 and each approximation , normalized by the number of spins in the system : @xmath81 since our maximum @xmath6 is rather small , this is done by direct summation .",
    "notice that both @xmath82 and @xmath83 are between zero ( perfect fit ) and one ( the worst fit ) if single - spin marginals of @xmath10 and @xmath7 are equal .    in fig .",
    "[ dvss ] , we plot the values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 measured over different ensembles of random networks vs.  the normalized entropy of the network s state space @xmath86 , which also varies between 0 and 1 . for all types of networks and",
    "approximation , the quality of fit is high ( @xmath87 is low ) when @xmath88 , so that the networks are unconstrained , and nearly all states are possible .",
    "this is trivial since even the zeroth order approximation ( each spin up or down with 50% probability ) would work well here",
    ".    as @xmath89 decreases , the fit errors increase .",
    "when @xmath89 reaches small values , the independent approximation , @xmath82 , starts behaving differently for the different network types . in the 4-spin case , by construction , @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath91 for any @xmath21 , and the best independent approximation is the uniform distribution . for this construction , the smallest possible entropy is @xmath92 , where the network exists in two mirror states , and there the error of @xmath73 is @xmath93 .",
    "in contrast , a 3-spin network freezes at @xmath94 , and each spin is strongly biased ( as in our xor networks above ) .",
    "thus the independent approximation provides a perfect fit in this case .",
    "the distinction between @xmath63 and @xmath64 vanishes for the pairwise maxent approximation . here , for both 3- and 4-spin networks , the fit errors behave similarly : for @xmath89 decreasing from 1 , @xmath95 grows from 0 and reaches its peak at about @xmath96 near @xmath97 .",
    "this is already interesting : @xmath83 almost never goes above 0.3 for all networks we tried .",
    "thus even in some of the worst cases , pairwise approximation is quite good !",
    "further , for even smaller entropies , @xmath83 rapidly drops , approaching zero faster than linearly in @xmath89 . for @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "it is even smaller , @xmath100 , for the quartic case .",
    "this is because @xmath101 , so that the whole @xmath102 curve is slightly shifted compared to @xmath103 at low @xmath89 .    in summary , for all the networks we have considered",
    ", pairwise sufficiency emerges robustly at low ( but not too low ) entropy .",
    "in fact , at @xmath98 , our networks can be in more than @xmath104 highly probable states .",
    "thus the networks are not totally frozen , and yet the pairwise approximation is nearly sufficient !",
    "crucially , this finding is robust to the changes in the network size : @xmath105 vs.  @xmath89 curves are stable over the entire range of @xmath6 we explored .    within a single narrow bin of @xmath89",
    ", @xmath83 may still have a rather large range .",
    "we explore this variability in the rightmost panel of fig .",
    "[ dvss ] . for this",
    ", we define @xmath106 ( recall that @xmath107 is the standard deviation of the random couplings used to generate the networks ) .",
    "@xmath108 measures the strength of interactions ( or constraints ) per spin , analogously to a similar parameter in the random constraint satisfaction problems @xcite . for quartic networks , where we have enough samples , we then plot @xmath83 vs.  @xmath89 for different ranges of @xmath108 .",
    "crucially , we find that , for the same @xmath89 , a larger @xmath108 results in better pairwise fits .",
    "in other words , a denser and stronger interacting network is more likely to be pairwise sufficient .",
    "this is potentially a good news for maxent approaches to biological systems , which are known for the immense complexity of the underlying biophysical interactions .",
    "we conclude this section by stressing that high probability states of pairwise sufficient @xmath0-spin networks are not close to each other . to illustrate this , we focus on the 4-spin case with @xmath109 , and on small but not negligible @xmath89 .",
    "we then evaluate the magnitude of the overlap , @xmath110 , among all highly probable network states and plot the distribution of the overlaps in fig .",
    "[ nonperturbative ] . for",
    "purely randomly distributed states , we would expect the standard deviation of overlaps to be @xmath111 , and a peak near zero .",
    "and we would expect magnitudes of overlaps near 1 if all highly probable states were clustered near a dominant one .",
    "instead , the distribution in fig .",
    "[ nonperturbative ] is not concentrated near 1 , and the standard deviation is @xmath112 . therefore , there is some clustering of probable states , but certainly not strong clustering .",
    "thus the state space of our networks can not be described as small fluctuations around a dominant state , and the pairwise sufficiency here is not perturbative @xcite .",
    "it likely emerges due to a previously not investigated mechanism .",
    "the toy example of the xor network suggests that the pairwise sufficiency may emerge when the network `` freezes '' to a few ( but not necessarily just one ) highly probable states , and different relatively tightly coupled clusters of spins decouple from each other .",
    "is this also true for our networks with a nonzero temperature ? how do energy landscapes of the sufficient and the insufficient networks differ from each other ? and are the maxent fits for both cases structurally different ?    to start exploring this , we estimate @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath72 inferred using ipfp .",
    "we do this by choosing @xmath115 states with the highest probability from @xmath116 .",
    "we get the energy of each such state as @xmath117 and then solve the linear regression problem to find the coupling constants from the states and their energies .",
    "finally , we calculate the eigenvalue spectra of the inferred @xmath114 , having set @xmath118 .",
    "the averaged spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ eigenvalues ] for different combinations of @xmath89 and @xmath83 .",
    "we see that the success of @xmath72 is correlated with the magnitude of the eigenvalues of @xmath114  larger magnitudes , which correspond to stronger interactions and more constrained distributions , give the pairwise sufficiency .",
    "this is true irrespective of @xmath89 ( though @xmath89 and @xmath108 are dependent , as we have discussed ) .",
    "crucially , if one rescales the spectra by their largest magnitude negative eigenvalue ( fig .",
    "[ eigenvalues ] , inset ) , then all spectra collapse . thus the @xmath114 ( or the energy landscapes ) of the pairwise",
    "sufficient and the pairwise insufficient fits are not intrinsically different : a rescaling ( change in temperature ) can morph one into the other .    having analyzed the pairwise sufficient and insufficient solutions , @xmath72 , we now focus on the landscapes of the @xmath0-spin networks themselves .",
    "the freezing that results in the decrease of @xmath83 and the growth of the eigenvalues of @xmath119 can create the landscapes of different types .",
    "for example , the highly probable states may be essentially uncorrelated , reminiscent of the landscapes of the hopfield network in the ferromagnetic phase @xcite .",
    "alternatively , as in our xor network , entire blocks of spins can merge into strongly correlated clusters , which then decouple from each other .",
    "then the low energy network states will be direct products of the states of the clusters . to disambiguate the two scenarios , we calculate pairwise spin - spin correlation @xmath120 by direct summation of @xmath7 (",
    "note that , for 4-spin networks , the correlation is equal to the covariance since @xmath121 ) .",
    "we then cluster the spins based on the absolute value of their correlations .",
    "figure  [ correlations ] shows the clusters for 4-spin networks ( note that since the number , the size , and the spin assignment for clusters are different for each network , we only show typical cases ) .",
    "a network with a near - zero @xmath83 ( left panel ) shows a perfect partitioning into two clusters ; @xmath122 bits is a result of this partitioning . as networks with larger entropies",
    "are considered , the number of clusters increases , and their boundaries become fuzzy , leading to worse maxent fits .",
    "when the definite cluster structure disappears , @xmath83 grows dramatically .",
    "thus the existence of well - defined spin clusters is correlated with the pairwise sufficiency .    for 3-spin networks ,",
    "in addition to the pairwise interactions , there are also nonzero single spin biases in the maxent fits .",
    "thus the entropy and correlations among spins are generally smaller for the same @xmath83 . nonetheless , as seen in fig .",
    "[ correlations3 ] , the ( fuzzy ) cluster structure for these networks is not that much different from the 4-spin case .    to further explore the network landscapes ,",
    "we point out that an inferred symmetric @xmath114 can be rewritten as @xmath123 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors , correspondingly .",
    "the eigenvalues take both large positive and large negative values for the pairwise sufficient networks ( cf .",
    "[ eigenvalues ] ) .",
    "the negatives correspond to wells in the landscape , and the positives correspond to peaks .",
    "if the wells and the peaks were clearly separated , then spin configurations in the vicinity of the well center , distinct from it by just a single spin flip , would have similar high probabilities ( this is what allows an eigenvector to act as a broad attractor in the hopfield network @xcite ) .",
    "the repulsive peaks far away from the wells would have little effect on @xmath83 since the probability of states away from the wells is small in the low temperature regime even without the peaks .",
    "in contrast , were spins to form tight clusters , flipping a single spin would not be allowed .",
    "peaks would be needed to decrease the probability of such cluster - breaking states , and thus positive eigenvalues would affect @xmath83 strongly .    to verify which of the two scenarios holds , for 4-spin networks , we construct the coupling matrix and the pairwise maxent distribution from only @xmath126 eigenvalues , @xmath127 we then evaluate @xmath83 between @xmath7 and @xmath128 as a function of @xmath129 .",
    "figure  [ d_eigen ] shows this dependence for a typical pairwise - sufficient distribution and for two different ways of including eigenvalues into @xmath119 . in the first , we proceed from the most negative eigenvalue to the most positive one . in the second , we proceed from the largest magnitude eigenvalue to the smallest one .",
    "since sorting by magnitude ( which includes large positive eigenvalues earlier ) approaches the terminal @xmath83 faster , wells and peaks must both affect close spin configurations .",
    "this is again consistent with the clustering picture .",
    "the clustered structure of the network landscapes allows us to propose a hypothesis for why densely coupled @xmath0-spin networks exhibit the pairwise sufficiency .",
    "we re - group terms in the energies , which define @xmath63 and @xmath64 in eqs .",
    "( [ triplet ] ,  [ quartic ] ) .",
    "for example , all terms that couple @xmath22 and @xmath130 for the 4-spin network can be rewritten as @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a kronecker delta .",
    "( here we slightly abused the notation and imposed that @xmath76 only occur in @xmath133 and @xmath134 . )",
    "this equation defines a random coupling @xmath135 , which depends both on the current network state and on the quenched randomness that went into building the network . for",
    "a large number of couplings , fluctuations in @xmath135 will be large enough so that , averaged over the accessible network states , @xmath135 stays far from zero compared to its standard deviation @xmath136 .",
    "this creates large effective pairwise coupling among spins , so that clusters of spins start behaving coherently",
    ". then the state of every spin in the cluster can be defined by choosing a cluster representative , setting its value , and then coupling each cluster member to the representative through a pairwise interaction  higher order couplings are not needed !",
    "the pairwise maxent fit is nearly exact , even though the network is far from frozen since values of the cluster representatives are not necessarily constrained .",
    "we illustrate this in fig",
    ".  [ cj ] , which shows that higher order couplings average to produce large effective pairwise interactions for correlated spins .",
    "in this numerical study , we showed that pairwise maxent models are more effective in approximating random @xmath0-spin networks ( @xmath55 ) than one would naively expect . even in the worst cases , the error of such models was rarely above @xmath137 , and it was much lower for densely coupled networks , with lower entropy per spin .",
    "we traced the emerging pairwise sufficiency to formation of coherent clusters of spins , largely decoupled among themselves , resulting in a multitude of dependent attractors for the system .",
    "this is not a perturbative effect and is a new proposal for explaining pairwise sufficiency .",
    "such collective behavior introduces substantial redundancy , and would allow error correction .",
    "however , this error correction is of a very different nature compared to , for example , the hopfield network @xcite .    does the mechanism presented here",
    "explain the pairwise sufficiency in any _ real _ biological system ?",
    "this is unclear since our analysis was limited to specific simulated networks , which may or may not be good models of real biology . specifically , the network in the original paper that observed the pairwise sufficiency @xcite had much smaller entropy per spin ( neurons rarely fired ) , and correlations among spins rarely exceed 0.2 . in contrast , while 3-spin networks in our simulations had smaller @xmath89 and smaller spin - spin correlations than their 4-spin counterparts , these numbers were still larger than those in the experiments .",
    "at the same time , pairwise maxent models do not fit experimental data perfectly ( certainly worse than some of our nearly perfect fits ) @xcite .",
    "it may be that some structural features of real systems allow them to operate at higher @xmath83 for smaller @xmath89 compared to the simple models we investigated here  and exploring a wider class of networks for signatures of behaviors that we observed would be the next step .",
    "this is especially important since large coherent deviations from the most probable state into @xmath138 metastable states seems to be a crucial feature of many experimental systems ( such as bursts of neural activity in the retina that predominantly stays quiet @xcite ) .",
    "such metastable states far away from the ground state at least resemble the models that we studied .",
    "in addition , maxent models in other fields may have very different properties compared to those in neuroscience , including different typical entropies and correlation strengths .",
    "therefore , we hope that our models and their generalizations will be able inform interpretation of experimental data , even if they do not match the experiments in some important properties .    with ( approximate )",
    "pairwise sufficiency seen in many collective biological phenomena , it is important to ask why these systems operate in the regime that allows it to hold . indeed , within our model",
    ", the pairwise sufficiency is not generic : low @xmath83 happens only for small @xmath89 , and preferentially when the strength of the interactions is high , @xmath139 ( cf .",
    "[ dvss ] ) .",
    "the need for redundancy and error correction is a potential explanation  but there is no obvious reason why the redundancy must result in the pairwise sufficiency ( indeed , simple parity - based codes probably do not ) . taking the improvement in @xmath83 with the increase in @xmath108 seriously , we propose",
    "a different explanation ( a similar argument was first suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "one can view evolution as trying to satisfy a growing list of constraints imposed upon a biological network by its interactions with the environment .",
    "these constraints can include efficient information processing , low energy consumption , robustness to perturbations , fitting within a certain physical size , responding quickly enough so that actions are relevant in the changing world , etc . some of these global constraints may be equivalent to a large number of local constraints .",
    "for example , efficient information transmission in the visual system typically includes removal of redundancy present in the natural stimuli @xcite , which is equivalent to a multitude of constraints on activities of nearby neurons .",
    "when contraints are added , fewer and fewer states of the network remain accessible .",
    "importantly , at least for certain abstract constraint satisfaction problems @xcite , before there are no more states left , the accessible states organize themselves in a handful of small , well - separated groups .",
    "whether these states are uncorrelated , or consist of collective flipping of clusters of spins , they can be well represented by pairwise maxent models .",
    "( in the former case , such maxent model would have a hopfield network structure @xcite ; in the latter , pairwise interactions would determine cluster assignments . )",
    "therefore , it can be that the pairwise sufficiency is a signature of a biological network nearing the unsatisfiability threshold , being pushed towards it by evolution . exploring landscapes of satisfiability problems with more realistic ensembles of constraints ( or interactions ) and comparing them to the landscapes observed in experiments",
