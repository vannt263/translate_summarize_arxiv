    "cold atom gases confined in reduced dimensionality represent an ideal system to observe many - body phenomena related to the prominent role played by quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental advances have paved the way to the investigation of quantum magnetism , notable examples being the demonstration of super - exchange interactions in bosonic gases  @xcite , the time evolution of spin impurities  @xcite , the observation of frustrated classical dynamics  @xcite and the engineering of ising  @xcite and anisotropic exchange hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "new opportunities in this direction are now stimulated by the prominent progress in cooling and controlling ultracold gases of magnetic atoms and polar molecules , which provide tunable platforms where the effect of long - ranged dipolar interactions can play a dominant role in determining the many - body dynamics  @xcite .",
    "such progress has opened a new door for the investigation of lattice models beyond the conventional hubbard paradigm , where long - range interactions can compete with local ones on the way to unveil richer many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "much attention has been devoted up to now to extended bose - hubbard models , where a new phase of matter , the haldane insulator ( close analog of the haldane phase in spin-1 chains ) has been predicted to occur  @xcite .",
    "however , not much is known on other possible magnetic phases for fermionic dipolar gases in optical lattices  @xcite , which present close analogy to the so called extended hubbard model ( ehm )  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we show that one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard models with long - range interactions support a non - trivial insulating phase characterized by bond order  @xcite [ a bond - order density wave ( bow ) ] due to the competition between dipolar and on - site interactions .",
    "this phase has attracted notable interest in recent years in the context of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "its existence is now well established but it has been long debated in a series of theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "the opportunity of realizing and observing such states of matter may shed new light on a series of issues , from its dynamical properties to its ground state robustness . in order",
    "to prove its existence in dipolar hubbard models , we combined analytical and state - of - the - art numerical methods based on the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the effect of dipolar interaction is evident already in the weak - coupling approach , leading to the prediction of a bow phase within one - loop order .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with standard ehms - on - site and nearest neighbor interaction only- , where a simple formalism is instead unable to capture its existence  @xcite .",
    "while the detection of the bow phase is in general challenging due to the limited extension in parameter space and its lack of density - like order parameters , we show how the recently developed _ in situ _ imaging techniques  @xcite provide an ideal route toward the unbiased identification of such phases since the bow phase is uniquely identified by the long - range order of non local parity correlations  @xcite .    ; the cdw - bow and bow - sdw transitions are of the gaussian and berezinskij - kosterlitz - thouless type respectively . errors in determining phase transition points are smaller than symbol sizes .",

    "the pseudo - spin degree of freedom can either be represented by different @xmath7 states ( for atoms ) , or by preparing molecules in different nuclear or rotor states  @xcite . once confined on a sufficiently deep optical lattice ,",
    "an effective description in terms of the hubbard hamiltonian leads to the discrete formulation @xmath8 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where the single species contributions read : @xmath9 with the first and second term describing tunneling and dipolar interactions respectively , and the interspecies coupling is @xmath10 where the first term is the on - site interaction @xmath11 ( given by a combination of local and dipolar potentials ) , and the last term describes interspecies dipolar interactions . from here on ,",
    "we will focus on purely repulsive dipoles , @xmath12 , as relevant , e.g. , for electrically polarized molecular gases . in the equal mass , equal interaction case ,",
    "the system inherits a global su(2 ) symmetry , which is preserved by the long - range tail , and is reduced to u(1 ) for general parameter choices . from here on , we will focus on the former case and consider a balanced half - filled chain , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of particles in the spin state @xmath15 and @xmath16 the system size .",
    "like in the case of the ehm , the phase diagram of eq .",
    "( [ h_dis ] ) is determined by the competition between local and non - local interactions . before searching for specific bow instabilities ,",
    "we illustrate the competing mechanism in the atomic limit @xmath17 , as such competition will then lead to spin - frustration at the origin of bond - order itself .    for dominant @xmath11 interactions ,",
    "the system ground state is a spin density wave ( sdw ) . on the other hand",
    ", a dominant dipolar interaction will minimize the energy by imposing double occupancies every second site , thus stabilizing a fully gapped charge density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "these two ground states , illustrated in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , become energetically degenerate along the line @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the riemann zeta function ) , which determines a phase transition between sdw and cdw . deeply in the quantum regime @xmath20 , however , quantum fluctuations may enhance the emergent frustration close to the classical transition line and lead to a different critical scenario .",
    "for the ehm , where only nearest - neighbor interactions are considered , it was argued by nakamura  @xcite that an additional phase with dominant charge bond - order instability occurs between the sdw and the cdw phases .",
    "this phase is characterized by a spontaneous spin - peierls dimerization , manifest in a charge polarization on alternating bonds and by the formation of spin dimers on the bonds , and constitutes a notable example of dimerization in strongly correlated systems due to frustration .",
    "a two - dimensional analog of this phase has been recently discussed for spinless dipolar fermions in layers  @xcite .",
    "the existence and extent of the bow phase in the ehm have been intensively debated mainly because ( i ) the instability is not captured by one - loop _ g_-ology calculations based on bosonization ( while more refined methods recently provided analytical evidence of it  @xcite ) , and ( ii ) numerical results were not consistent due to the small extent in parameter space of such a phase , and to the difficulty of providing an accurate location of the critical line  @xcite . in the following , combining analytical and numerical methods ,",
    "we show that dipolar systems support spontaneous spin - peierls dimerization , and that the corresponding bow phase occupies a larger region in parameter space with respect to the ehm .",
    "first of all , we show that one - loop _ g_-ology is sufficient to establish the existence of bond - order in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "then , the existence and extent of the bow phase are benchmarked with dmrg simulations .",
    "we now present a qualitative study of eq .   within the bosonization framework  @xcite . as a first step ,",
    "we express the fermionic lattice operators in terms of continuum chiral fields @xmath21 : @xmath22,\\ ] ] with @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the lattice spacing and @xmath25 the fermi momentum .",

    "typically , the bosonization mapping is applied to the microscopic hamiltonian , taking as a starting point non - interacting fermions , and thus deriving the effective parameters in the low - energy theory in a perturbative manner , limiting the validity to the regime @xmath29 . here",
    "we take advantage of recent analytical and numerical results , and explore an alternative route to derive the coefficients in the effective low - energy theory , typical , e.g. , in the landau theory of fermi liquids @xcite .",
    "our starting point is the single species hamiltonians eq .",
    "( [ h_sigma ] ) , and not the free tunneling hamiltonians as usual . in their gapless regime ,",

    "this ensures a controlled estimate of @xmath33 in the regime @xmath34 , and possibly beyond .",
    "we notice that embodying interactions in a non - perturbative ( although approximate ) manner in bosonized hamiltonians is an established procedure , which allows one to retain features usually missing in perturbative treatments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we then proceed and , on the top of the interacting single species hamiltonian , we consider the role of @xmath35 .",
    "we first introduce density and spin collective fields : @xmath36 after bosonizing the interspecies interaction @xmath35 , the hamiltonian @xmath37 can be decoupled into a density and spin sector , @xmath38 , where the physics in each sector is described by a sine - gordon model : @xmath39 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & g_{c / s}\\int dx \\cos[\\sqrt{8\\pi}\\varphi_{c / s}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that terms coupling density and spin degrees of freedom are also present ; in the following we will neglect their effects , which are supposed to be small away from the regime @xmath29 due to their large scaling dimension .",

    "a similar procedure is illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the ehm model : here , the su(2 ) symmetry is recovered by fixing @xmath43 .",
    "the sine - gordon model then supports a berezinskij - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite at @xmath44 , that , from its microscopic form , is @xmath45 at weak coupling , the transition occurs at @xmath46 . in the charge sector",
    ", the luttinger parameter @xmath47 always satisfies @xmath48 ( since @xmath49 ) : as such , phase transitions in this sector only depend on the coefficient @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , @xmath51 defines a gaussian phase transition line between phases where the cosine potential in @xmath52 is pinned at different values ( at strong coupling , this line can be unstable toward @xmath53 mass terms when @xmath54 ) .",
    "the perturbative estimate of @xmath50 reads @xmath55= u-\\frac{3\\zeta(3)v}{2}.\\ ] ] implying a weak - coupling gaussian transition at @xmath56 .",
    "the phase diagram can be subsequently mapped out by considering the dominant orders as in the case of the ehm .",
    "since we have applied the same mapping procedure and got a similar low - energy field theory , the different phases are characterized by the same field structure as in ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath57 ,",
    "the system is in a sdw phase , with a gapless spin sector and dominant correlations of the form @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",

    "in analogy with the ehm analysis , the corresponding charge field is pinned at the value @xmath63 , contrary to the sdw phase , where @xmath64 .",
    "this behavior is triggered by the pre factor of the mass gap , @xmath50 : according to its sign , the cosine potential is either pinned around @xmath65 or @xmath66 , which implies different expectation values for @xmath67 .    , for @xmath68 as a function of @xmath69 for different system sizes @xmath16 .",

    "this is due to the effects of the long - range dipolar tails , which consistently affect the luttinger parameter of the single species hamiltonians , and lead to different conditions for the bkt and gaussian transitions .",
    "however , the treatment is supposed to work only in the weak - coupling regime since on - site interactions are taken into account only perturbatively , and the provided estimate on the gaussian line does not capture indeed the entire dipolar interaction .",
    "moreover , treating the interchain interactions non - perturbatively requires the su(2 ) symmetry to be reinforced at low - energies as discussed above ; the quantitative accuracy of this procedure is hard to establish _ a priori_. in order to confirm the existence and the finite extent of a bow phase at finite , intermediate couplings , a non - perturbative approach is required . in the next section ,",
