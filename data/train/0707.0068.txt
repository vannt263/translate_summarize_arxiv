    "massive stars distinguish themselves from their lower mass siblings by their exceptionally high main - sequence luminosities , such that their lifetimes are measured in myr rather than gyr .",
    "individual stars may be readily studied in detail in external galaxies - it was not be accident that the first post - servicing mission wfpc2 image was obtained of the wolf - rayet star melnick  34 in the 30 doradus star - forming region of the lmc ( news release : stsci-1994 - 05 ) . here , selected hst results are discussed , together with their impact upon european astronomy .",

    "winds of early - type stars are predicted to be driven by radiation pressure through ( cno , fe - peak ) metal - lines ( e.g. vink et al . 2001 ) , from which metal - poor stars are expected to possess lower density , slower winds .",
    "indeed , wind velocities of early o stars in the smc were established to be slower than those of comparable galactic stars ( e.g. prinja & crowther 1998 ) , from civ 1550 observations , although it has taken large ground - based surveys , such as the vlt / flames survey of massive stars in milky way , lmc and smc clusters to quantify the metallicity - dependence of mass - loss rates , revealing dm / dt @xmath1 ( mokiem et al .",
