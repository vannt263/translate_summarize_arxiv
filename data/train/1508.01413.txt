    "in recent two - flavor lattice simulations with the manifestly chiral - invariant overlap dirac operator a large degeneracy of @xmath0 mesons has been discovered upon truncation of the near - zero modes from the valence quark propagators @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy turned out to be larger than the @xmath1 symmetry of the qcd lagrangian .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the symmetry group that drives this degeneracy has been reconstructed , that is @xmath4 .",
    "this symmetry `` rotates '' the fundamental vector @xmath5 and includes both the @xmath6 chiral rotations as well the @xmath7 rotations in the _ chiralspin _ space that mix the left- and right - handed components of the quark fields .",
    "it has been shown that there are no magnetic interactions between quarks in the system after truncation and consequently a meson after truncation represents a dynamical quark - antiquark system connected by the electric field .",
    "such a system has been interpreted as a dynamical qcd string and the @xmath2 symmetry has been identified to be a symmetry of confinement .",
    "this symmetry has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where transformation properties of different operators have been obtained .",
    "it has also been found that this symmetry is hidden in the qcd hamiltonian in coulomb gauge , namely in the coulombic interaction part .",
    "the confining charge - charge part is a @xmath2-singlet and generates therefore a @xmath2- symmetric spectrum .",
    "interactions of quarks with the magnetic field explicitly break this symmetry of the confinement part and are also responsible for the @xmath6 and @xmath8 breakings .",
    "the appearance of the @xmath2 symmetry has also been demonstrated in @xmath3 mesons , which can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    here",
    "we study if @xmath2 also appears in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 baryon spectrum after removing the quasi - zero modes .",
    "the elimination of the quasi - zero modes has been accomplished earlier with wilson - type fermions ( chirally improved fermions ) in the baryon sector in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the chiral restoration has been studied",
    ". the question of the @xmath2 could not be addressed at that time , however .",
    "the outline of the article is as follows : in chapter [ chapter - chiral - parity ] we review the classification of baryon operators according to the irreducible representations of the parity - chiral group and show , which states should become mass degenerate if the @xmath11 and higher @xmath2 symmetry is in the system . in chapter [ chapter - lattice - setup ] we shortly present the details of the lattice setup . in chapter",
    "[ chapter - results ] the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix and effective masses are presented , which show @xmath6 , @xmath11 and @xmath2 symmetries upon truncation of the near - zero modes . in chapter [ conclusions ] we summarize our findings .",
    "all possible two - flavor baryon fields can be classified according to the @xmath6 representations @xmath12 @xcite , see table i.    .chiral multiplets for baryons with fixed total spin @xmath13 , wirh @xmath12 being the index of the parity - chiral multiplet . [",

    "in the article prd 92 , 074508 ( 2015 ) we have demonstrated a @xmath2 symmetry in the baryon spectrum upon elimination of the quasi - zero modes of the dirac operator from the quark propagators .",
    "we have also claimed a degeneracy of states belonging to different irreducible representations of @xmath2 .",
    "the latter statement is actually incorrect and the present lattice data indicate existence of @xmath2 only . whether a higher symmetry exists or not can not be deduced from these results .",
    "we considered the former interpolator as to be independent from the latter .",
    "this is actually incorrect , because their sum vanishes after performing of the fierz transformation .",
    "consequently , the interpolator @xmath17 together with the interpolator ( 6 ) of the paper form a @xmath18 representation of @xmath6 .",
    "this means that all three @xmath19 interpolators with @xmath17 form an irreducible dim=20 representation of @xmath2 ."
