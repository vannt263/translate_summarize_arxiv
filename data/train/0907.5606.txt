    "it has been known for a long time that the floer theoretic invariants of cotangent bundles should be expressible in terms of classical invariants of the base .",

    "closer to the subject of this paper , abbondandolo and schwarz proved in @xcite that the wrapped floer cohomology of a cotangent fibre is isomorphic to the homology of the based loop space .",
    "the study of fukaya categories in the setting of homological mirror symmetry as well as some of its applications to lagrangian embeddings ( see @xcite ) requires understanding such floer theoretic invariants at the chain level .",

    "theorem [ thm : main ] relies on the fact that a certain map we shall construct inverts an isomorphism constructed by abbondandolo and schwarz in @xcite . in summer 2009 , the author was informed by schwarz that he , together with abbondandolo , can prove that these maps are indeed inverses and planned to write it out in an upcoming paper , leading the author to write down a proof that the maps are right inverses ( the proof is sketched in section [ sec : cotangent ] ) .",
    "an interesting analytic problem seems to arise when trying to construct by hand the homotopy that would independently prove that the maps are also left inverses , but this is of course unnecessary as the right inverse to an isomorphism is also a left inverse .",

    "corollary [ cor : restriction ] leads us to make the following conjecture :    any inclusion of a liouville subdomain @xmath35 induces an @xmath2 restriction functor @xmath38    it is important to note that this result can not hold if we do not pass to twisted complexes on the right hand side ( or derived categories if the reader prefers that language ) .",
