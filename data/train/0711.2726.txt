    "estimate of free energy differences is useful for many applications including protein / ligand binding affinities and drug design as well as for theoretical perspectives .",
    "a rough classification of the plethora of computational methods devised for determining free energy differences can be based on the possibility of sampling a system at equilibrium or out of equilibrium .",
    "equilibrium approaches include thermodynamic integration@xcite , free energy perturbation@xcite and umbrella sampling techniques@xcite .",
    "representative examples of nonequilibrium techniques are the so - called adaptive force@xcite or potential@xcite bias methods .",
    "the efficiency of the latter techniques depends crucially on how fast the history - dependent force or potential changes in time , or in other words , how far from equilibrium the simulation is carried out . from this point of view",
    ", adaptive bias potential methods would be more appropriately defined as quasi - equilibrium techniques .    in the context of nonequilibrium approaches@xcite ,",
    "a substantially different scenario has been disclosed by jarzynski@xcite and crooks@xcite , who introduced `` truly '' nonequilibrium methods for determining free energy differences . in particular they proposed two exact equations , referred here as jarzynski equality and crooks nonequilibrium work theorem , relating free energy differences between two thermodynamic states to the external work done on the system in an ensemble of nonequilibrium paths switching between the two states . in a recent paper shirts _",
    "et al._@xcite have demonstrated that the bennett acceptance ratio@xcite can be interpreted , exploiting the crooks nonequilibrium work theorem , in terms of the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimate of the free energy difference given a set of nonequilibrium work values in the forward and reverse directions .",
    "one of the major shortcomings of these nonequilibrium techniques is that free energy profile along a given reaction coordinate , _",
    "i.e. _ the potential of mean force ( pmf ) , is hardly available .",
    "with the two sets of forward and reverse nonequilibrium paths , crooks nonequilibrium work theorem@xcite and ml method@xcite yield only the free energy differences between the final and initial states .",
    "the jarzynski equality , on the other hand , can in principle be used to calculate the pmf .",
    "however it is well - known @xcite that the exponential average in the jarzynski equality depends crucially on a small fraction of realizations that transiently violate the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "since such `` magic '' realizations are very unlikely to occur among a collection of fast rate realizations , it is clear that the potential of mean force can not be determined accurately by the direct application of the jarzynski equality .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate how to recover the pmf using ml estimators@xcite and path - ensemble averages in systems driven far from equilibrium@xcite .",
    "we test the method on the unfolding process of the @xmath0-helix form of an alanine deca - peptide through steered molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "let us consider a system that can switch between two states , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , characterized by different values of an arbitrary reaction coordinate @xmath3 , namely @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we denote with @xmath6 ( forward ) any realization during which the reaction coordinate is forced to vary from @xmath4 to @xmath5 with a prescribed time schedule .",
    "accordingly , we denote with @xmath7 ( reverse ) any realization that brings the reaction coordinate from @xmath5 to @xmath4 with inverted time schedule .",
    "the kind of computational or experimental technique used for producing the realizations is not relevant .",
    "the essential requirement is that the used technique furnishes the value of the work done on the system during the realizations .",
    "suppose to produce a collection of @xmath8 forward realizations and a collection of @xmath9 reverse realizations , each realization being started from microstates ( _ i.e. _ , phase space points ) sampled from an equilibrium distribution ( equilibrium microstates of @xmath1 for the @xmath6 realizations and equilibrium microstates of @xmath2 for the @xmath7 realizations ) .",
    "specifically , an equilibrium microstate of , _ e.g. _ , @xmath1 is simply obtained by sampling the system in thermal equilibrium with a bath , the reaction coordinate being constrained to the value @xmath4@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we assume that all realizations are performed at a very fast rate , which implies that they are carried out far from equilibrium . as a consequence",
    ", the final microstates of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 realizations will not be distributed according to the equilibrium distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "it is evident that the same holds true for the intermediate microstates of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 realizations .",
    "for example , the microstates characterized by a generic value @xmath10 of the reaction coordinate obtained during a realization starting either from @xmath1 ( @xmath6 realization ) or from @xmath2 ( @xmath7 realization ) will not be equilibrium microstates of the state @xmath11 characterized by the reaction coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "this situation is schematically represented in fig .",
    "we now denote a generic @xmath12th @xmath6 realization with @xmath13 , where the superscript @xmath14 means that the thermodynamic state corresponding to the initial microstate is @xmath1 ( first letter ) and that such microstate is taken from an equilibrium ensemble of microstates ( uppercase ) , while the thermodynamic state corresponding to the final microstate is @xmath2 ( second letter ) and that such microstate belongs to an ensemble of microstates out of equilibrium ( lowercase ) . following this notation ,",
    "the segments from @xmath4 to @xmath10 and from @xmath10 to @xmath5 of the @xmath13 realization are denoted as @xmath15 and @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 .",
