    "the development of the luttinger liquid description of quantum fluids  @xcite and the related formalism of conformal field theory  @xcite have lead to the prediction of power - law scaling for first - order correlations at large distances , with an exponent given in terms of the equation of state that is known exactly from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "the algebraic bethe ansatz provides a determinantal representation of correlations , from which their asymptotic behavior can be extracted  @xcite .",
    "more recently , exact expressions for local second- and third - order correlations  @xcite , together with exact results for the one - body correlation function at asymptotically short distances  @xcite in terms of the equation of state have been derived .",
    "away from the asymptotic short- and long - range regimes , the behavior of correlation functions is less well known . for intermediate interaction strengths and arbitrary",
    "length scales one must resort to numerics to determine the correlation functions .",
    "results for the latter have been obtained using numerical methodologies including quantum monte carlo  @xcite , and density matrix renormalization group approaches  @xcite . a recently developed , integrability - based approach combines the decomposition of correlation functions into sums over matrix elements ( form factors ) of certain simple operators between bethe ansatz eigenstates  @xcite .",
