    "[ continua ] let @xmath0 be a locally connected , simply connected , homogeneous continuum .",
    "then no arc separates @xmath0 .",
    "we recall that an arc in @xmath0 is the image of a 1 - 1 continuous map @xmath1\\to x$ ] .",
    "we say that an arc @xmath2 separates @xmath0 if @xmath3 has at least two connected components .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is simply connected if it is path connected and every continuous map @xmath4 can be extended to a continuous @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the 2-disc and @xmath7 its boundary circle ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ continua ] relies on alexander s lemma for the plane ( see @xcite ) and our generalization of this lemma to simply connected spaces ( see sec .",
    "2 ) .    there is a family air between continua theory and group theory .",
    "this became apparent after gromov s theory of hyperbolic groups ( @xcite ) .",
    "gromov defines a boundary for a hyperbolic group which is a continuum on which the group acts by a ` convergence action ' .",
    "the classic ` cyclic elements ' decomposition theory of whyburn was extended recently by bowditch ( @xcite ) in this context and it gave deep results in group theory . `",
    "asymptotic topology ' , introduced by gromov ( @xcite ) and developed further by dranishnikov ( @xcite ) , shows that the analogy goes beyond the realm of hyperbolic groups .",
    "the ` philosophy ' of this is that topological questions that make sense for continua can be translated to ` asymptotic topology ' questions which make sense for groups ( see @xcite for a dictionary between topology and asymptotic topology ) .",
    "one wonders whether theorem [ continua ] holds in fact for all locally connected , homogeneous continua of dimension bigger than 1 :    let @xmath0 be a locally connected , homogeneous continuum of dimension 2 .",
    "is it true that no arc separates @xmath0 ?",
    "we note that by a result of krupski ( @xcite ) , homogeneous continua are cantor manifolds .",
    "it follows that no arc separates a homogeneous continuum of dimension bigger than 2 .",
    "krupski and patkowska ( @xcite ) have shown that a similar property ( the disjoint arcs property ) holds for all locally connected homogeneous continua of dimension bigger than 1 which are not 2-manifolds .",
    "we remark that by @xcite if a cantor set separates a homogeneous continuum @xmath0 then @xmath8 .",
    "so question 1 is equivalent to the following question : is it true that if no cantor set separates a locally connected , homogeneous continuum @xmath0 , then no arc separates @xmath0 ?",
    "restated in this way the question makes sense also for boundaries of hyperbolic groups .",
    "in fact a similar question can be formulated for finitely generated groups too ( see @xcite ) .",
    "not much is known about locally connected , simply connected homogeneous continua .",
    "one motivation to study them is the analogy with finitely presented groups .",
    "another reason is that one could hope for a classification of such continua in dimension 2 :    are the 2-sphere and the universal menger compactum of dimension 2 the only locally connected , simply connected , homogeneous continua of dimension 2 ?",
    "we recall that @xmath7 and the universal menger curve are the only locally connected homogeneous continua of dimension 1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "prajs ( @xcite , question 2 ) asks whether @xmath9 is the only simply connected homogeneous continuum of dimension 2 that embeds in @xmath10 .",
    "a related question about locally connected , simply connected continua that makes sense also for finitely presented groups is the following :    let @xmath0 be a locally connected , simply connected homogeneous continuum which is not a single point . does @xmath0 contain a disc ?",
    "we remark that in the group theoretic setting the answer is affirmative for hyperbolic groups ( @xcite ) . by a result of prajs ( @xcite ) a positive answer to this",
    "would imply that @xmath9 is the only locally connected , simply connected , homogeneous continuum of dimension 2 that embeds in @xmath11 .",
    "we refer to prajs list of problems ( @xcite ) for more questions on homogeneous continua .",

    "we note that the interior , say @xmath67 , of @xmath351 is homeomorphic to @xmath360 and since @xmath361 are separated by @xmath334 in @xmath0 , it follows by alexander s lemma that @xmath361 are separated in @xmath67 by a connected component of @xmath362 .",
    "we call this component @xmath71 ( figure [ diskos ] ) .",
    "clearly @xmath363 is a subarc of @xmath334 that contains cross points or cross intervals of @xmath334 with @xmath364_{\\alpha } $ ] .",
    "let @xmath312 be such a cross point",
    ". then we can write @xmath363 as @xmath365 , where @xmath366 , are ( connected ) subarcs of @xmath334 , such that @xmath367 . furthermore , at least one of @xmath166 does not intersect @xmath336 ( this is by our choice of @xmath368 and @xmath312 ) .",
    "it follows that at least one of @xmath369 is compact .",
    "we set @xmath370 .",
    "we will define two sets @xmath39 such that the following are satisfied : @xmath39 are closed subsets of @xmath67 that contain @xmath371 and @xmath372 respectively , @xmath41 is connected contained in @xmath373 and @xmath374 .",
    "let now @xmath378 be a connected component of @xmath375 different from @xmath77 and suppose that @xmath379 .",
    "we consider the closure of @xmath71 , @xmath380 , in @xmath381 .",
    "@xmath380 is connected thus the closure of the component of @xmath382 containing @xmath378 intersects @xmath383 .",
    "indeed , we consider the set @xmath384_{\\alpha})$ ] as an open subset of the continuum @xmath385 .",
    "let @xmath386 be the component of @xmath387_{\\alpha})$ ] that contains @xmath378 .",
    "we recall that if @xmath67 is an open subset of a continuum and @xmath77 is a component of @xmath67 then the frontier of @xmath67 contains a limit point of @xmath77 ( theorem 2.16 , p.47 of @xcite ) .",
    "it follows that the closure of @xmath386 intersects @xmath350_{\\alpha}$ ] .",
    "we have a similar conclusion if @xmath390 . therefore if a connected component of @xmath375 different from @xmath77 lying in @xmath376 intersects the closure of both @xmath391 we have that an open interval of @xmath136 around @xmath312 lies in @xmath348 .",
    "this is impossible since @xmath312 is a cross point .",
    "we argue similarly for connected components of @xmath375 contained in @xmath377 .",
    "we conclude that the union of the components of @xmath375 which lie in @xmath376 , intersect exactly one of @xmath391 .",
    "clearly the same is true for the union of the components of @xmath375 contained in @xmath377 . in particular",
    "exactly one of the following two holds :    \\1 . if @xmath378 is a connected component of @xmath375 different from @xmath77 lying in @xmath376 then the component of @xmath392 containing @xmath378 intersects @xmath371 , while if @xmath378 lies in @xmath377 the component of @xmath393 containing @xmath378 intersects @xmath372 .",
    "\\2 . if @xmath378 is a connected component of @xmath375 different from @xmath77 lying in @xmath376 then the component of @xmath392 containing @xmath378 intersects @xmath372 , while if @xmath378 lies in @xmath377 the component of @xmath393 containing @xmath378 intersects @xmath371 .",
    "assume that we are in the first case .",
    "then we define @xmath105 to be the union of the components of @xmath375 intersecting @xmath376 together with @xmath371 .",
    "we define @xmath106 to be the union of the components of @xmath375 intersecting @xmath377 together with @xmath372 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath39 are closed and that @xmath394 , @xmath374 .",
    "since @xmath71 is connected , @xmath39 are connected too .",
    "we define @xmath39 similarly in the second case .",
    "we note now that at least one of @xmath39 is compact subset of @xmath67 , thus bounded in @xmath67 .",
    "since @xmath71 separates @xmath395 and @xmath39 are closed subsets of @xmath351 , applying alexander s lemma for the plane we have that at least one of @xmath39 separates @xmath395 in @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that either @xmath396 or @xmath397 separates @xmath395 .",
    "we remark that the same argument holds in the case @xmath312 is replaced by a cross interval @xmath208 : we have then that @xmath398 with @xmath399 and as before either @xmath396 or @xmath397 separate @xmath395 in @xmath67 .",
    "now we can continue subdividing intervals along cross points ( cross intervals ) that lie in @xmath364_{\\alpha } $ ] as follows : let s say that @xmath396 separates @xmath395 .",
    "we have that there is a connected component of @xmath396 , say @xmath400 , that separates them .",
    "we note that @xmath401 is a subinterval of @xmath136 and if there is a cross point ( or cross interval ) of @xmath402_{{\\alpha}},h\\beta$ ] contained in its interior , we repeat the previous procedure replacing @xmath71 by @xmath400 . if not we have a contradiction .",
    "therefore , either @xmath395 are separated in @xmath67 by the inverse image of an interval @xmath363 of @xmath334 which does not contain in its interior any cross point of @xmath403 lying in @xmath364_{\\alpha } $ ] , or by iterating this procedure we conclude that the inverse images under @xmath53 of intervals of @xmath404 of arbitrarily small diameter separate @xmath219 from @xmath177 in @xmath67 .",
    "it is clear that both are impossible , so the theorem is proven ."
