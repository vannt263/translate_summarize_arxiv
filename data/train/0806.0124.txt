    "a fluxon in long josephson junctions ( ljj ) is a well - known physical example of a sine - gordon fluxon .",
    "fluxons , endemic to ljjs , have been employed in the fabrication of devices like constant voltage standards @xcite , flux flow oscillators @xcite , logic gates @xciteand also in qubits @xcite .",
    "ljjs of various geometries have been thoroughly studied both experimentally and theoretically in the past .",
    "fluxon dynamical properties like fluxon pinning @xcite , fluxon trapping @xcite , and phase locked states have been studied for rectangular @xcite and annular @xcite ljjs .",
    "the non rectangular josephson junction has been in the focus of fluxon dynamics study in recent years because of the non uniformity caused by the shape .",
    "semicircular geometry for josephson junction has been proposed and fluxon dynamics has been studied both analytically and numerically and its various applications has been discussed @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in the presence of an external magnetic field applied parallel to the dielectric barrier of such a geometry , the ends of the junction has opposite polarities and because of that opposite polarity fluxons can enter the junction from the ends under a properly biased dc current .",
    "if the direction of the current is reversed , flux penetration and progression is not possible and flux free state exists in the junction .",
    "this unique phenomenon can not be achieved in any other geometry and thus this junction behaves as a perfect diode .",
    "the effect of in - plane static and rf - magnetic field on fluxon dynamics in a semiannular josephson junction has also been studied @xcite .",
    "the response of a fluxon to an ac - drive has investigated by several authors .",
    "it was shown that in a system with periodic boundary condition average progrssive motion of fluxon commenses after the amplitude of the ac drive exceeds a certain threshold value @xcite .",
    "complex switching distributions has been obtained for ac - driven annular jjs and theoretical explanation has been provided for the multipeaked experimental observations @xcite . the behavior of fluxon under two ac forces has been studied and it was shown that the direction of motion of fluxon is dependent on ratio of frequencies , amplitudes and phases of the harmonic forces @xcite . in this work , we study the effect of an ac - bias applied in the plane of a semi - annular josephson junction . in section",
    "ii we discuss the equation representing the junction and arrive at an expression for the potential of the junction .",
    "the numerical results are also presented . in section iii",
    "we demonstrate creation and annihilation of fluxons in semiannular jjs in the presence of an ac bias and an external magnetic field . section iv deals with the results and discussion .",
    "the dynamical equation for a semiannular ljj in a harmonically oscillating field applied in its plane is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the superconducting phase difference between the electrodes of the junction with the spatial coordinate @xmath2 normalized to @xmath3 , the josephson penetration depth and time @xmath4 normalized to the inverse plasma frequency @xmath5and @xmath6 , @xmath7 being the maximum velocity of the electromagnetic waves in the junction .",
    "@xmath8 is resistance per unit length , @xmath9 is the inductance per unit length , @xmath10 is the capacitance per unit length , and @xmath11is the normalized amplitude of a dc bias normalized to maximum josephson current @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the applied ac biasing .",
    "@xmath14 is the quasiparticle tunneling loss and @xmath15 is the surface loss term in the electrodes and their values vary from @xmath16 to @xmath17 in experiments .",
    "the surface loss term is important and it will dominate fluxon propagation in some cases .",
    "the term @xmath18 is due to the semicircular geometry of the junction and @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the first critical field of the josephson junction .",
    "@xmath22 is the flux quantum and its value is @xmath23 .",
    "the extra term @xmath24 corresponds to a force that drives fluxons towards the left and anti fluxon towards the right .",
    "thus in the absence of an external field a flux free state will exist in the junction as any static trapped fluxon present in the junction will be removed @xcite . in the absence of any perturbation ( [ singannu ] )",

    ", the change in potential energy due to the combined effect of fluxon motion and the applied field can be determined by integrating the term @xmath31 over the length of the junction @xcite .",
    "the fluxon induced potential as a function of the fluxon coordinate x may be calculated as @xmath32 the integration over @xmath33 to @xmath34 may be justified as the length of the junction is very large as compared to the size of the fluxon . substituting eq .",

    "the pinned state of a vortex corresponds to a zero voltage state .",

[ velrate ] describes the effect of perturbations on the vortex velocity .",
    "the first term represents the effect of applied biasing , the second and the third term represents dissipation and fourth term is the effect of the external magnetic field on the semicircular geometry .    in perturbational analysis ,",
    "a vortex is considered as a non - relativistic particle of rest mass @xmath45 moving in one dimension .",

    "is increased the potential gets tilted finally favoring the motion of the vortex .",
    "the dc bias at which the zero voltage switches to a finite voltage is called the depinning current .",

    "hence progressive motion of fluxon does not occur for this value of biasing as the average velocity of a fluxon moving in such a potential would be zero .",
    "however as the dc - biasing is increased though the form of the potential is still oscillating , there is a definite tilt which makes progressive motion of fluxon possible .",
    "the response of the system to such a potential can be investigated by measuring the velocity of the fluxon in the potential .",
