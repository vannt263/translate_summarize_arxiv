    "if the system is time - reversal invariant , we have @xmath66 .      theoretically speaking , the hamiltonian for superconducting pairing potential generally has the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the real ( imaginary ) part of the s - wave gap , @xmath69 is the imaginary ( real ) part of the p - wave gap , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the basis @xmath72 .",
    "we find that the matrices @xmath73 and @xmath74 satisfy the dirac algebra @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",

    "next , we will show that the matrix @xmath80 corresponds to rotating the spin from z axis to the @xmath81 direction where @xmath81 is a three dimensional unit vector .",
    "generally a wave function in the basis @xmath61 has the form @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the 2-component spinor wave function for the electron ( hole ) .",
    "when we rotate the electron spin as @xmath84 the spinor wave function for the hole will be transformed as @xmath85 therefore the wave function is transformed as @xmath86 therefore the matrix @xmath80 corresponds to the rotation in the spin space . because the su(2 ) generators @xmath79 are constructed from the eq .",

    "this is consistent to the fact the @xmath87 are the basis of spin - triplet pairing .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath89 represent the superconducting pairing in the same spin channel .",
    "therefore , as long as the superconducting pairing can be written as the superposition of the basis @xmath87 , we can always find a rotation operator which can rotate a general spinor to the axis in which the electron and hole have the spin .",

    "based on the lehmann representation , the retarded green s function is related to the spectral function as @xmath94 where @xmath35 and @xmath95 are the spatial coordinates .",
    "because the spectral function @xmath96 is hermitian , the principle integral @xmath97 is hermitian , and @xmath98 is anti - hermitian . the spectral function can be written as @xmath99 . as we are interested in the superconducting pairing , in the following , we will focus on the off diagonal part of the spectral function which has the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the superconducting pairing amplitudes . because @xmath103 , @xmath104 and the spectral function @xmath96 are hermitian , the coefficients @xmath101 and @xmath102 are real .",
    "we now focus on the retarded green s function at @xmath50 because it is related to the mfs in the topological superconductors .",

    "[ gf-5 ] , we conclude that spin - singlet pairing is completely forbidden in the anti - hermitian part of the anomalous green s function @xmath111 which indicates that the mfs can not have spin - singlet pairing .",
    "when a normal lead is attached to a superconductor , the andreev reflection at the sc / nm interface will induce the superconducting condensate in the normal region . in the following and for a one - dimensional ( 1d ) sc / nm junction , we use scattering matrix theory to show that the induced superconducting condensate by the mf resonant andreev reflection is always spin - triplet .",

    "this requires @xmath120 because @xmath121 we have either @xmath122 , @xmath123 or @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",

    "soc will shift the two spin - subbands to opposite direction in the momentum space . in the 1d tight - binding model with @xmath132-like soc hamiltonian at low energy limit",

    ", we have @xmath138 , @xmath139 .",

    "the induced spin - triplet condensates are described by @xmath142 which is even under time - reversal operation . here",
    "we assume the majorana spins are parallel or anti - parallel to z axis .",

    "<S> , we show that mfs , zero - energy bound states of tscs , have only spin - triplet superconducting correlations which are model independent and guaranteed by particle - hole symmetry for time - reversal broken tscs ( d class @xcite ) and particle - hole as well as time - reversal symmetries for time - reversal respected tscs ( diii class @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to our experimental prediction that no matter whether the bulk superconducting gap is spin singlet @xcite or triplet @xcite , the mf - induced resonant andreev reflection ( ar ) only injects spin - triplet cooper pairs into the normal lead . </S>",

    "<S> however the situation for time - reversal invariant tscs is very different . </S>",
    "<S> because the superconducting condensates exist in both spin - up and spin - down channels , the spin - triplet cooper pairs can always enter the time - reversal invariant tscs which is independent of their spin direction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our prediction can also be applied to multi - band and even two - dimensional quantum wells with equal rashba and dresselhaus soc strengths , which have been realized experimentally @xcite . in this case , the spin precession angles for all transverse channels are the same @xcite and the d - vector of the triple pairs will not decay even in the presence of spin - independent disorder @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillatory critical current has also been predicted and observed in the non - topological superconductor / ferromagnet / superconductor ( sfs ) josephson junction where time - reversal is broken and mfs do not play any role in contrast to our system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the current - phase relation in the sfs junction undergoes a 0-@xmath1 transition when the critical current approaches zero . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the current - phase relation of our time - reversal broken josephson junction does not undergo a @xmath0-@xmath1 transition . </S>",
    "<S> this makes our prediction qualitatively different from that in the sfs junction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our prediction of a soc controlled critical current is a transport signature of mfs . in a realistic experimental setup , </S>",
    "<S> the semiconductor wire may not necessarily be perfect 1d but may have several channels . however , our prediction requires the scattering at the tsc / nm interface to be 1d . </S>",
    "<S> the recent development of a surface split - gates design @xcite can make a real 1d point contact between the topological superconducting semiconductor wire and the normal lead . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our experimental proposal can be realized by an existing experimental technique .    </S>",
