    "oscillations between particle and antiparticle have been observed first in the neutral kaon system @xcite and later also in the neutral @xmath4 meson system @xcite .",
    "such oscillations are predicted by the standard model and proceed through the so called box diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "1 . since the top quark as well as the @xmath5 boson are heavy compared to the @xmath4 meson it is convenient to describe the oscillations in an effective theory , where the top quark and the @xmath5 boson are integrated out .    we shall concentrate in this paper on the oscillations in the neutral @xmath4 meson system .",
    "the effective hamiltonian , which is obtained after integrating out the top quark and the @xmath5 boson , consists of only one operator @xmath6 where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 denotes the left - handed component of the @xmath9 quark field ) and @xmath10 is a function which arises from integrating out the top quark and the @xmath5 boson at the same scale @xcite @xmath11    to evaluate the mass shift @xmath3 relevant for the oscillations , one needs to calculate the matrix element of this effective interaction between a neutral @xmath4 meson and its antiparticle ; it is given by @xmath12 where @xmath2 is the @xmath4 meson decay constant defined by @xmath13 the coefficient @xmath14 contains the short distance contribution of the qcd corrections which is calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "it depends on the factorization scale @xmath15 at which the short distance contributions become separated from the long distance ones ; the non - perturbative long distance contributions are contained in the `` bag parameter '' @xmath16 , which depends in such a way on @xmath15 that the matrix element of the hamiltonian is scale independent .    as an estimate for the order of magnitude of the effect",
    "the so called `` vacuum insertion '' assumption has been frequently used in the past , which corresponds to the case @xmath17 . however , since @xmath16 is scale dependent this assumption has to be supplemented by a statement about the scale where it is assumed to be valid .",
    "the short distance contribution from scaling down to a scale @xmath18 has been calculated in leading logarithmic approximation some time ago @xcite and yields @xmath19 which gives a correction factor of @xmath20 at the scale of the @xmath21 quark .",
    "the corrections induced by subleading logarithms wich are to be considered in conjunction with the @xmath22 matching conditions at the @xmath5 scale have also been calculated @xcite .",
    "if one could get some information on the parameter @xmath16 at a scale of the order of the @xmath4 quark mass , one could in fact predict the amplitude of the oscillations as a function of the ckm matrix elements and the top quark mass .",
    "however , at the present time the only non - perturbative information available is from lattice methods @xcite , which gives some information on the parameter @xmath23 at low scales at these low scales is indeed close to the value @xmath17 used in the vacuum insertion assumption @xcite . ] .",
    "thus it is desirable to scale further down to these very low scales .",
    "this is possible by switching at the point @xmath24 to heavy quark effective theory @xcite , in which the @xmath21 quark is integrated out and replaced by a static color source . the leading logarithmic result for the scaling @xmath25 , i.  e.",
    "the resummation of logarithms @xmath26 , has been calculated in @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath27 this result is indeed very peculiar , since the anomalous dimension of the four fermion operator @xmath28 is the sum of the anomalous dimensions of the two left handed currents involved . in fact , if factorization like e.  g. vacuum insertion assumption takes place , one would expect this behaviour of the anomalous dimension to all orders .",
    "however , the qcd scaling below @xmath29 has been calculated even to subleading order @xcite and it seems that this factorization does not hold for the subleading result .",
    "heavy quark effective theory is a systematic expansion in inverse powers of the heavy quark mass .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the existing calculations of the scaling below @xmath29 by including terms of the order @xmath30 into the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the motivation is twofold .",
    "firstly , there are indications from the lattice that the @xmath30 corrections could be large , even for the @xmath21 quark .",
    "secondly , this is the first attempt to deal with the @xmath30 corrections in a non - leptonic process , of which the hamiltonian for @xmath31 mixing is certainly the easiest to deal with .    in section 2",
    "we shall discuss an appropriate operator basis for the @xmath30 corrections to @xmath0 mixing and calculate the anomalous dimension matrix and the wilson coefficients at some low scale @xmath15 .",
    "in section 3 we shall estimate the @xmath30 effects by using the vacuum insertion assumption and the results on the @xmath32 corrections for the heavy meson decay constants obtained from qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "to leading and subleading order in @xmath32 , the effective lagrangian for a heavy quark moving with velocity @xmath33 is given by @xcite ( we use @xmath34 ) @xmath35 where the transverse derivative @xmath36 is denoted as @xmath37 , the heavy quark field is defined by @xmath38 and the sources @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the heavy quark and antiquark fields with velocity @xmath33 have been retained .",
    "since there is also a heavy antiquark involved , one has to use also the effective lagrangian for an antiquark which can be obtained from ( [ hqet - lagrangian ] ) just by replacing @xmath33 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath43 along with the proper replacements of the sources : @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    using the quark - type parameterization for one factor in the effective hamiltonian ( [ o_0 ] ) and the antiquark - type parameterization in the other factor ( using the nomenclature of @xcite ) one obtains the effective hamiltonian density at the matching scale @xmath24 in terms of heavy quark fields @xmath46 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the matching scale there are two local operators @xmath47 and three nonlocal operators @xmath48 , which are time - ordered products originating from the @xmath32 piece of the lagrangian : @xmath49 \\nonumber\\\\    { \\cal o}_2^+ & = & i\\int d^4 x\\ ,      { \\rm t}\\left [ { \\cal o}'_0(0)\\ , ( \\bar h_v^+ ( id)^2 h_v^+          + \\bar h_v^- ( id)^2 h_v^- ) ( x ) \\right ] \\\\    { \\cal o}_3^+ & = & i\\int d^4 x\\ ,      { \\rm t}\\left [ { \\cal o}'_0(0)\\ , ( \\bar h_v^+              \\frac{g}{2 } \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu}g_{\\mu\\nu } h_v^+          + \\bar h_v^- \\frac{g}{2 } \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } g_{\\mu\\nu } h_v^- ) ( x )      \\right].\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficients of the @xmath30 terms are @xmath50    in order to calculate the leading logarithmic qcd corrections to this effective hamiltonian , one first has to set up a basis of operators bearing the correct dimension and quantum numbers .",
    "since there are three independent momenta in the transition , and five independent gamma matrix structures possible , one arrives at a basis of 15 local operators : @xmath51(\\bar d_l h_v^- ) \\nonumber\\\\",
    "r_2 & = & \\left[i\\partial_\\mu ( \\bar d_l \\gamma_\\mu h_v^+)\\right ]          ( \\bar d_l h_v^- ) \\nonumber\\\\    r_3 & = & \\left[i\\partial_\\mu ( \\bar d_l h_v^+)\\right ]          ( \\bar d_l \\gamma^\\mu h_v^- ) \\nonumber\\\\    r_4 & = & \\left[iv\\cdot \\partial ( \\bar d_l \\gamma_\\mu h_v^+)\\right ]          ( \\bar d_l \\gamma^\\mu h_v^- ) \\nonumber\\\\    r_5 & = & i \\epsilon_{\\lambda\\mu\\nu\\rho } v^\\lambda        \\left[i\\partial^\\mu    ( \\bar d_l \\gamma^\\nu h_v^+)\\right ]          ( \\bar d_l \\gamma^\\rho h_v^- ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] operators containing @xmath52 or @xmath53 matrices can be eliminated by the projection operators implicit in the @xmath8 and @xmath54 fields .",
    "these operators can mix with each other through the diagrams of fig.2 .",
    "in addition , there are also the diagrams of fig .  3 which introduce mixing of the nonlocal operators @xmath48 with the local operators .",
    "note that there is no mixing in the other direction since the local operators do not require the nonlocal ones as counterterms .",
    "one can employ the symmetries of the effective hamiltonian to simplify the mixing matrix .",
    "firstly , the lowest order operator as well as the @xmath30 corrections in ( [ hqet - heff ] ) have the property of being symmetric under fierz transformations , i.  e.  after exchanging the two light quarks one recovers the original operator by rearranging the indices of the gamma matrices operators which arise in the mixing , in order to obtain the fierz transform a partial integration is also necessary . ] .",
    "therefore it is useful to switch to an operator basis @xmath55 of definite fierz parity : @xmath56 in the case at hand , there are seven linear combinations of @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 with positive and eight combinations with negative fierz parity .    secondly , the operators can be divided into a class of operators @xmath60 which are symmetric under the exchange @xmath61 , and another class of antisymmetric operators @xmath62 .",
    "it turns out that there is no mixing between these two sets .",
    "since the operators introduced by tree - level matching ( [ hqet - heff ] ) have positive parity both under fierz and @xmath61 transformations , the @xmath63 and @xmath64 operators can be neglected altogether .",
    "thirdly , one can eliminate all operators which vanish because of the equations of motion @xmath65 since they do not contribute to physical matrix elements and do not mix with operators that do contribute .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of the nonlocal operators is obtained simply by adding the anomalous dimension of the lowest order effective hamiltonian @xmath66 and the anomalous dimensions of the @xmath32 terms in the effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "since the former is just twice the anomalous dimension of the involved current , this pattern of factorization is found again for the nonlocal part of the recoil corrections to the four fermion matrix element .    evaluating the one loop diagrams depicted in fig . 2 and 3",
    "we obtain the result summarized in tab .",
    "( tab .  [ matrix - table ] ) : the mixing matrix of the relevant operators separates into two blocks . the chromomagnetic moment operator @xmath67 mixes with the fierz symmetric operators @xmath68 the first one being the operator that already occurred in the matching conditions ( [ match ] ) .",
    "the kinetic energy operator @xmath69 requires as counterterm a fierz antisymmetric operator which is renormalized multiplicatively @xmath70 with these definitions , the effective hamiltonian at scales @xmath71 is given including the @xmath30 terms by @xmath72.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the array of wilson coefficients @xmath73 is the solution of the renormalization group equation @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the anomalous dimension matrix as listed in tab .",
    "[ matrix - table ] .",
    "@xmath76    the entries in the anomalous dimension matrix have been calculated in a general covariant gauge and have been found to be gauge independent , as it should be the case .",
    "however , there is a gauge dependence in the counterterms of the @xmath77 operators corresponding to operators which vanish according to the equations of motion ( [ eom ] ) , indicating that these terms are unphysical .",
    "the solution of ( [ rge ] ) can be written in the form @xmath78",
    "\\left(\\begin{array}{c } c(m_b)\\\\a(m_b)\\\\b(m_b ) \\end{array } \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for @xmath82 . with the initial conditions at @xmath83 taken from ( [ initial ] ) the solution ( [ formsol ] )",
    "reads @xmath84 with @xmath85 for @xmath82 . inserting the values @xmath86 and the one loop approximation for @xmath87",
    ", we obtain at @xmath88 @xmath89 together with the value @xmath90 .",
    "in order to state numerical results , one has to calculate the matrix elements of the operators as given above , evaluated between eigenstates of the lowest - order hqet langrangian since the mass dependence resides now in the coefficients .",
    "as long as a non - perturbative calculation is not available , one has to rely on model assumptions .",
    "we shall estimate all matrix elements using the vacuum insertion assumption .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction we expect this assumption to at least give the correct order of magnitude since the parameter @xmath16 calculated from the lattice is indeed of order unity .    using the vacuum insertion assumption for the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian we shall encounter the same matrix elements as in the discussion of the heavy meson decay constant @xmath2 which has been analyzed to order @xmath91 using qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the meson decay constant @xmath2 and its leading recoil corrections may be parameterized in terms of four constants , which have been estimated in @xcite .",
    "both results for @xmath2 @xcite are consistent and we shall use the values given in @xcite for the four parameters .",
    "the parameters describing the heavy meson decay constant are defined by the following matrix elements @xmath92 @xmath93    | \\bbar^0 ( v ) \\rangle \\\\    & & =   f(\\mu ) \\,g_1 ( \\mu)\\ ,    { \\rm tr } \\left\\ { \\gamma m^+ ( v ) \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\    \\label{g2 }    & & i \\int d^4 x \\ ,    \\langle 0 | \\,{\\rm t } \\left [ ( \\bar{d } \\gamma h_v^+ ) ( 0)\\ ,    \\frac{g}{2}(\\bar{h}_v^+ \\sigma_{\\mu \\nu } g^{\\mu \\nu } h_v^+ ) ( x ) \\right ]    | \\bbar^0 ( v ) \\rangle \\\\    & & =    6 f(\\mu ) \\,g_2 ( \\mu)\\ ,    { \\rm tr } \\left\\ { \\gamma m^+ ( v ) \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constant @xmath94 is the difference between the heavy quark and the heavy meson mass ; the other three constants @xmath95 and @xmath96 depend on the renormalization point @xmath15 . in @xcite these constants",
    "have been estimated at the low scale @xmath97 .",
    "the values obtained from qcd sum rules for the four parameters are @xcite @xmath98 where the effective value for @xmath99 as discussed in @xcite has been used . furthermore , the matrix @xmath100 appearing in eqs.([fmu]-[g2 ] ) is the representation matrix for a heavy pseudoscalar meson containing a heavy quark @xmath101    vacuum insertion for the lowest order operator @xmath66 corresponds to the replacement @xmath102 where the factor @xmath103 is a colour factor : the light quark operators may be contracted in two ways with the light quarks in the mesons which corresponds to taking the fierz transform .",
    "one of the possibilities is colour singlet and contributes with a factor 1 , the other one is a combination of colour singlet and octet , of which only the singlet contributes .",
    "this yields in total a factor of @xmath103 for a fierz symmetric operator like @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , one would obtain a factor of @xmath104 for a fierz antisymmetric operator .    to evaluate this",
    "the matrix elements involving mesons containing a heavy anti - quark are needed .",
    "they are given by the same constants @xmath105 and @xmath106 due to charge conjugation and are evaluated by replacing the matrix @xmath100 by @xmath107 thus we obtain for the matrix element of @xmath66 @xmath108    after vacuum insertion all the matrix elements of the local operators in the order @xmath91 @xmath109 and @xmath110 may be expressed in terms of @xmath111 and @xmath94 .",
    "the non - vanishing matrix elements of the local operators are @xmath112 where the two possible contractions of the light quark in the four fermion operators have been taken into account . for the local operators with a definite fierz parity , the result is @xmath113    we shall now define the vacuum insertion for the non - local operators @xmath48 . for the piece of @xmath114 containing the quark operators @xmath42",

    "analogously we define vacuum insertion for the matrix element of the non - local operator @xmath67 and obtain @xmath117 while the matrix elements of @xmath118 vanish due to the equations of motion of the heavy quark .    within the framework of the vacuum insertion assumption",

    "the most important @xmath30 corrections arise from the nonlocal operators ; furthermore , the fact that @xmath99 is not well known @xcite introduces a large uncertainty in the final result .    however , the matrix elements of the nonlocal operators factorize in leading log order in the same way as the leading operator @xmath66 does , because the diagrams of fig .",
    "3 which could lead to non - factorizable contributions only introduce local operators as counterterms , and the local operators in turn do not mix with the nonlocal ones",

    "in fact , the leading log result only implies that in the static limit @xmath131 is scale independent for @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the scale where perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "however , the static value @xmath134 of @xmath16 is not fixed and we have simply set its value to unity . for an arbitrary value of @xmath134 our results for @xmath3 would be multiplied by this factor . in particular , eq .",

    "we presented a complete calculation of the leading log qcd corrections to order @xmath30 for the effective hamiltonian relevant for @xmath0 mixing .",

    "the latter have recently been estimated using the qcd sum rule approach @xcite . as far",
    "as @xmath2 is concerned the @xmath30 corrections according to @xcite are indeed large ; however , in our analysis we have absorbed these large corrections into @xmath2 .",

    "eventually , the matrix elements of the four fermion operators should be evaluated non - perturbatively , e.  g.  by lattice calculations .",
