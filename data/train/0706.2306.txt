    "applying a bias voltage or a temperature gradient across a conductor makes rise to charge and energy currents .",
    "the linear response between the biases and currents is described via the thermoelectric matrix , whose diagonal parts are the charge and thermal conductances , and the off - diagonal parts are often referred to as the thermoelectric coefficients . in typical metals ,",
    "the latter arise due to the asymmetry between positive- and negative - energy excitations with respect to the fermi energy , i.e. , electrons and holes .",
    "such asymmetry in metals is very small , making the typical thermoelectric effects at sub - kelvin temperatures hard to measure accurately .",
    "placing a superconductor in good contact to a normal - metal conductor makes rise to finite pair correlations also inside the latter , even when the pair potential inside it vanishes .",
    "this superconducting proximity effect has an energy - dependent penetration depth ; at typical measurement temperatures of the order of 100 mk it extends up to the micrometer range . the proximity effect modifies the thermoelectric response of the normal conductor .",
    "most importantly , it makes rise to thermoelectric effects which are orders of magnitude larger than in the absence of superconductivity .",
    "the proximity - induced modifications are discussed in this paper by employing the quasiclassical theory in the diffusive limit @xcite . in this theory",
    ", we assume that all the relevant length scales of the problem exceed especially the fermi wavelength ( quasiclassical approximation ) and the mean free path ( diffusive limit ) .",
    "examples of such relevant length scales are the structure size and the superconducting coherence length .",
    "a further property of the quasiclassical theory , especially important for thermoelectric effects , is that it assumes electron - hole symmetry .",
    "because of this , in the normal state it predicts vanishing thermoelectric coefficients .    the proximity modification of the thermoelectric matrix is conveniently described in andreev interferometers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) , where there are two superconducting contacts to the normal metal . in this structure ,",
    "the phase difference between the two contacts affects the proximity modifications , and its presence is an important requirement for finite thermoelectric effects , at least within the quasiclassical theory .",
    "this type of a dependence of the electric conductance on the phase has for example been suggested for use in quantum measurements of flux qubits @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermoelectrictransport ] , we briefly introduce the thermoelectric effects and their relations in normal metals and after that detail the quasiclassical equations for the diffusive limit .",
    "we also discuss briefly effects left out in the present paper .",
    "section [ sec : scspectrum ] introduces to the properties of the spectral supercurrent and two aspects of nonequilibrium supercurrent : first , we briefly mention the nonequilibrium control of the supercurrent and then concentrate more on how the energy distribution function of electrons is controlled with the supercurrent .",
    "the latter is a precursor to the thermoelectric effects .",
    "these are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : thermocoefs ] , which first introduces to the special symmetries of the thermoelectric matrix , and then details the behavior of its components as a function of the phase difference and temperature . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluxdependence ] , we mention the effects relevant when considering the dependence on the magnetic flux , and finally in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] we conclude and point out the open questions related with understanding the measurements of the thermoelectric effects .",
    "in this paper , we show that the superconducting proximity effect is able to generate large thermoelectric effects , which can be described without employing the electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "an important factor in the theory is the presence of supercurrent , which then needs to be taken into account in the description of the currents .",
    "moreover , to describe transport between normal metals in the presence of supercurrent , we need to have multiple terminals connected to the structure .",
    "as the biases mostly deal with the quasiparticle current , we define the thermoelectric matrix in a multi - terminal structure according to @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the total charge current and the equilibrium supercurrent flowing to terminal @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the energy current ( supercurrent as such carries no energy current ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath5 is the bias voltage and @xmath6 is the temperature difference from some average temperature @xmath7 , both present in terminal @xmath8 .",
    "thermoelectricity in normal - metal wires can be practically described especially in the diffusive limit ( structure size @xmath9 , elastic mean free path @xmath10 and fermi wavelength @xmath11 satisfying the relation @xmath12 ) . in this limit , the charge and heat currents flowing in the wire are given by    @xmath13    here @xmath14 is the diffusion constant , @xmath15 is the density of states , @xmath16 is the cross - sectional area of the wire and @xmath17 is the coordinate parallel to the wire .",
    "the heat current can be simply related to the energy current via @xmath18 .",
    "for linear response , @xmath19  the second term is responsible for joule heating  and we can expand the electron energy distribution function @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , the fermi function . furthermore , assuming some characteristic length @xmath9 and taking @xmath22 and @xmath23 allows us to relate the results to eq .  .",
    "the energy - dependent changes in the density of states or the diffusion constant typically take place at large energy scales of the order of the fermi energy @xmath24 .",
    "we can thus expand them as @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "to linear order in @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we then get @xcite    [ eq : nstateexpressions ] @xmath29    here @xmath30 w@xmath31k@xmath32 is the lorenz number , and the electron - hole asymmetry is described by the factor @xmath33 .",
    "these relations show that the thermoelectric effects in normal metals are of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "the onsager - kelvin relation between the two thermoelectric coefficients is an example of a more general relation @xcite between different linear - response coefficients . according to this relation , the elements of the thermoelectric matrix in eq .   should satisfy @xmath35 under the reversal of the magnetic field @xmath36",
    "here @xmath37 .",
    "this relation results essentially only from the assumption of time - reversal symmetry . in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetry ] , we show how this equation can be derived for the energy - dependent response coefficients within the quasiclassical theory .    the presence of superconductivity modifies the above laws in many different ways @xcite .",
    "for example , the andreev reflection @xcite breaks the wiedemann - franz law , and the mott law is broken in asymmetric structures @xcite .",
    "the effects related to the superconducting density of states or to charge imbalance make modifications to the thermoelectric effects at interfaces @xcite and for the nonlinear response @xcite .",
    "the main modification at linear response due to the proximity effect is the appearance of thermoelectric effects even without electron - hole asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the latter effect is at the low temperatures where superconductivity can be observed much stronger than that expected from the electron - hole asymmetry .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on an electron - hole symmetric theory in the remainder of this paper .",
    "we employ the quasiclassical theory that provides a fair description of inhomogeneous superconductivity both in equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems .",
    "moreover , for simplicity and also dictated by many of the experiments , we concentrate on the diffusive limit .",
    "heterostructures composed of diffusive normal - metal or superconducting wires in and out of equilibrium can be described through the use of usadel equations @xcite for the keldysh green s functions @xmath38 .",
    "these equations are reviewed in many references  we cite here only a few of those @xcite applying similar parametrization as here .",
    "written in the nambu @xmath39 keldysh space , usadel equation is a nonlinear differential equation for a @xmath40 matrix , @xmath41=\\left[-i e + \\check{\\delta } + \\check{\\sigma},\\check{g}\\right ] .",

    "an example of such other types of scattering is the spin - flip scattering , described in the born approximation by the self - energy@xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the spin - flip scattering time .",
