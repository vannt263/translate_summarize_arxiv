    "the @xmath6 anisotropic heisenberg model ( ahm ) on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) chain is one of the prominent models describing the physics of strongly interacting fermions on a lattice .",
    "the model is also well realized in several novel materials , e.g. , in the 1d mott - hubbard insulator the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom remain spin excitations , and the closest realizations correspond to the isotropic case @xmath7 .",
    "the integrability of the model via the bethe ansatz has so far led to a number of exact results regarding the spin dynamics at @xmath8,@xcite as well as some thermodynamic results at @xmath9 .",

    "a nontrivial example is @xmath14 representing the energy current and leading directly to its non - decaying behavior@xcite and within the linear response to infinite thermal conductivity @xmath15 at any @xmath16 , being also the explanation for the very large spin contribution to heat conductivity in spin - chain materials .",
    "@xcite    we concentrate in this paper rather on spin dynamics and response , as evidenced by the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath17 , with the emphasis on the hydrodynamic regime of small @xmath18 .",
    "the behavior is also expected to be anomalous since it has been shown that spin conductivity @xmath4 has a ballistic ( dissipationless ) contribution  spin stiffness @xmath19  again at any @xmath16 within the gapless xy regime @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite although the corresponding spin current @xmath20 is not a conserved quantity , the ballistic component has been well established via several connections : ( a ) the spin current is closely related to many - body ( mb ) level dynamics @xmath21 with respect to flux @xmath22 @xcite and their independent - like character in an integrable mb model@xcite in contrast to level repulsion in a generic nonintegrable system , ( b ) via the limited decay of correlation functions due the overlap with conserved quantities @xcite , @xmath23 , at least for a partly polarized system with nonzero magnetization , @xmath24 , ( c ) the overlap with a steady state solution@xcite which  unlike other local conservation laws  is not orthogonal to the spin current in the @xmath25 sector . while the behavior is evidently different@xcite but as well highly nontrivial in the gapped ising - like regime @xmath26 where results seem to favor @xmath27 , @xcite there seems to be most controversy on the strict vicinity of the isotropic point @xmath28 .",

    "the latter quantity should be constant @xmath32 within the diffusion regime , as is shown to be for the nonintegrable case .",

    "this behavior of @xmath236 at low frequency is also clearly visible in the normalized integrated dynamical conductivity @xmath232 , see lower part of fig .",
    "such a behavior has been already observed in ref  .     dependence of ( a ) @xmath224 and ( b ) normalized @xmath232 . ]",
    "to strengthen our arguments we numerically investigate @xmath224 and the normalized integrated @xmath232 , obtained with exact ( full ) diagonalization where @xmath164-peaks are binned in windows @xmath256 . in fig .",
    "[ si ] we present characteristic results on @xmath224 and @xmath232 for anisotropies @xmath257 and different magnetizations @xmath258 . as clearly visible ,",
    "the regular part @xmath259 starts with zero , consistent with eq .",
    "( [ regu ] ) . however , due to the small system sizes reachable by ed , it is hard to differentiate the predicted @xmath260 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ regu ] ) from some more general power law of @xmath261 with @xmath262 .",
    "let us comment on the above results and the form of the memory function @xmath263 , as deduced from the relation eq .",
    "( [ to ] ) . if one would insert a general form @xmath264 into eq .",
    "( [ to ] ) and assume a nonsingular behavior of @xmath265 , it is evident that the dissipationless component and @xmath266 are only consistent for @xmath267 and @xmath268 .",
    "in particular , for reproducing the form ( [ regu ] ) we need @xmath269 .",
    "such a result clearly puts strong restrictions to proper analytical approaches to the dynamical response of integrable systems such as the ahm in the `` conducting '' regime .",
    "still some caution is welcome in the interpretation of our result since both analytical argument as well as numerical results should be firm against finite - size scaling . in particular , the relation ( [ lc ] ) requires the uncorrelated eigenvalues of @xmath226 and @xmath270 beyond the finite size @xmath271 ( some our preliminary results confirm this conjecture ) while certain numerical results also reveal low - frequency finite - size anomalies @xcite although not for presented examples .",
    "our results confirmed the essential difference of the finite-@xmath35 hydrodynamic behavior between integrable and generic nonintegrable quantum many - body systems .",
    "for the example of the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath17 and spin relaxation function @xmath138 in the 1d generalized ahm we showed that a term breaking integrability , in our case non - zero next - neighbor repulsion @xmath272 , induces a `` normal '' diffusive behavior in the hydrodynamics , i.e.  small @xmath273 regime .",
    "this is well reflected in the memory - function analysis where the spin - current decay rate @xmath0 as the central quantity is effectively constant , i.e.  @xmath274 in a range of small @xmath273 .",
    "results are in addition well captured within the perturbation - theory approach starting from the xx noninteracting - fermion model .",
    "the integrable model with @xmath134 we investigated in the `` conducting '' ( gapless ) regime , i.e.  for @xmath25 , @xmath275 and @xmath24 , in this way avoiding the anomalous diffusion as established in the `` mott - insulating '' state at @xmath276.@xcite from the existence of dissipationless spin transport and finite stiffness @xmath277 it is evident that the current decay rate should vanish in the limit @xmath18 , i.e.  @xmath278 .",
    "a nontrivial result of our analysis is , however , that in this respect the universality of the noninteracting xx model is followed throughout the whole gapless regime revealing @xmath279 at @xmath181 .",
    "while the similarity to the xx model occurs in the low-@xmath38 regime , this is not the case at larger @xmath280 . in the latter regime @xmath281 for the xx model while @xmath180 induces @xmath282 but only weakly @xmath273-dependent .",
    "in fact , results in this @xmath283 regime again resemble the perturbation - treatment analysis , which at least within the lowest order clearly fails to capture the low - frequency dynamics .",
    "nontrivial are also conclusions for the uniform case @xmath118 where the results for @xmath284 are extracted from the uniform conductivity @xmath236 .",
    "the only consistent possibility with the dissipationless @xmath285 component and vanishing regular part @xmath286 is @xmath287 with @xmath268 , e.g.  for @xmath269 the analytical argument is correct .",
    "this again indicates that in an integrable system the current scattering is ineffective at low @xmath38 at any @xmath35 in spite of even strong fermion interactions at @xmath179 .",
    "although we analyzed only spin - density hydrodynamics , one can easily speculate on the behavior of other transport properties , in particular the energy density in the context of heat diffusion .",
    "since @xmath251 is a conserved quantity , the @xmath118 dynamical thermal conductivity @xmath288 is particularly simple with only a dissipationless part and the corresponding thermal - current memory function @xmath289 at any @xmath16 .",
    "the extension to finite-@xmath36 energy - density response @xmath290 is not straightforward , but from the analogy to spin hydrodynamics and the noninteracting case one can firmly predict that the decay rate should vanish again as @xmath291 . in a similar way one can possibly speculate on the @xmath181 hydrodynamics of other 1d integrable models such as the 1d hubbard model .    experimentally , the most relevant model is the isotropic @xmath197 1d heisenberg model realized in several novel materials @xcite .",
    "but in the absence of external magnetic field @xmath25 case it is also the most controversial one .",
    "our results in fig .",
    "[ q ] both for high @xmath202 as well as for lower @xmath169 are not conclusive due to the restricted system sizes .",
    "nevertheless , together with the assumption @xmath292 ( anomalous diffusion ) one could expect the dependence @xmath293 with @xmath294 . since the effective ( momentum - dependent ) diffusion coefficient @xmath295",
    ", one could conclude that the scaling with the system size @xmath296 should follow @xmath297 .",
    "indeed at high temperatures such a scaling and divergence of @xmath298 has been recently found in nonequilibrium bath scenarios with @xmath299 .",
