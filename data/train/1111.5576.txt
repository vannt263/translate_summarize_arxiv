    "the idea of modifying the algebra of the space - time components @xmath2 in such a way that they become non - commuting operators has appeared many times in the physical literature ( @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite blokhintsev @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "the aim of most of these proposals was to endow space - time with a discrete structure , to be able , for example , to construct quantum fields free of ultraviolet divergences .",
    "sometimes a non - zero commutator is simply postulated , in some other instances the motivation is the formulation of field theory in curved spaces .",
    "string theories @xcite @xcite and quantum relativity @xcite @xcite have also provided hints concerning the non - commutativity of space - time at a fundamental level .",
    "a somewhat different point of view has been proposed in @xcite vilela3 . there",
    "the space - time noncommutative structure is arrived at through the application of the _ stability of physical theories principle _ ( spt ) .",
    "the rationale behind this principle is the fact that the parameters entering in physical theories are never known with absolute precision .",
    "therefore , robust physical laws with a wide range of validity can only be those that do not change in a qualitative manner under a small change of parameters , that is , _",
    "stable _ ( or _ rigid _ ) theories .",
    "the stable - model point of view originated in the field of non - linear dynamics , where it led to the notion of _ structural stability _",
    "andronov @xcite .",
    "later on , flato @xcite and faddeev faddeev have shown that the same pattern occurs in the fundamental theories of nature , namely the transition from non - relativistic to relativistic and from classical to quantum mechanics , may be interpreted as the replacement of two unstable theories by two stable ones . the stabilizing deformations lead , in the first case , from the galilean to the lorentz algebra and , in the second one , from the algebra of commutative phase - space to the moyal - vey algebra ( or equivalently to the heisenberg algebra ) .",
    "the deformation parameters are @xmath3 ( the inverse of the speed of light ) and @xmath4 ( the planck constant ) . except for the isolated zero value ,",
    "the deformed algebras are all equivalent for non - zero values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "hence , relativistic mechanics and quantum mechanics might have been derived from the conditions for stability of two mathematical structures , although the exact values of the deformation parameters can not be fixed by purely algebraic considerations . instead , the deformation parameters are fundamental constants to be obtained from experiment and , in this sense , not only is deformation theory the theory of stable theories , it is also the theory that identifies the fundamental constants .",
    "the spt principle is related to the idea that physical theories drift towards simple algebras @xcite @xcite @xcite , because all simple algebras are stable , although not all stable algebras are simple .    when the spt principle is applied to the algebra of relativistic quantum mechanics ( the poincar - heisenberg algebra)@xmath5 & = & i(m_{\\mu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\nu \\rho } + m_{\\nu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\mu \\sigma } -m_{\\nu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\mu \\rho } -m_{\\mu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\nu \\sigma } ) \\\\   \\lbrack m_{\\mu \\nu } , p_{\\lambda } ] & = & i(p_{\\mu } \\eta _ { \\nu \\lambda } -p_{\\nu } \\eta _ { \\mu \\lambda } ) \\\\",

    "is that from the unstable poincar - heisenberg algebra @xmath8 one obtains a stable algebra with two deformation parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in addition there are two undetermined signs @xmath11 and @xmath12and the central element of the heisenberg algebra becomes a non - trivial operator @xmath13 .",
    "the existence of two continuous deformation parameters when the algebra is stabilized is a novel feature of the deformation point of view , which does not appear in other noncommutative space - time approaches .",
    "these deformation parameters may define two different length scales .",
    "of course , once one of them is identified as a fundamental constant , the other will be a pure number .",
    "being associated to the noncommutativity of the generators of space - time translations , the parameter @xmath10 may be associated to space - time curvature and therefore might not be relevant for considerations related to the tangent space .",
    "it is , of course , very relevant for quantum gravity studies @xcite .",
    "already in the past , some authors @xcite , have associated the noncommutativity of translations to gravitational effects , the gravitation constant being the deformation parameter .",
    "presumably then @xmath10 might be associated to the planck length scale .",
    "however @xmath9 , the other deformation parameter , defines a completely independent length scale which might be much closer to laboratory phenomena .",
    "this will be the working hypothesis to be explored in this paper .",
    "therefore when @xmath10 is assumed to be very small the deformed algebra may be approximated by@xmath5 & = & i(m_{\\mu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\nu \\rho } + m_{\\nu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\mu \\sigma } -m_{\\nu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\mu \\rho } -m_{\\mu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\nu \\sigma } ) \\\\",

    "notice that in relation to the more general deformation obtained in chrysso , we are also considering @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 in ahluwalia2 ) .",
    "the nature of the sign @xmath11 has physical consequences . if @xmath17 time will have a discrete spectrum , whereas if @xmath18 it is when one the space coordinates is diagonalized that discrete spectrum is obtained . in this sense if @xmath17 , @xmath9 might be called `` the fundamental time '' and `` the fundamental length '' if @xmath19 . in this paper one",
    "discusses consequences of both signs .",
    "general ( noncommutative ) geometry properties of the algebra ( [ i.3 ] ) have been studied before @xcite as well as some other consequences vilela2 @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite . here",
    "the emphasis will be on effects which might be detectable at the laboratory level , if the working hypothesis that @xmath9 defines a much larger scale than planck s is true .",
    "in addition , some of the non - commutativity and time - discreteness effects that have been proposed in the past will be discussed , in particular to find out whether they are or not relevant as a test of the algebra ( [ i.3 ] ) .",
    "in the recent past , most papers dealing with space - time non - commutativity start from the hypothesis@xmath20=i\\theta _ { \\mu \\nu }   \\label{i.4}\\]]@xmath21 being a c - number antisymmetric tensor ( for a review see @xcite ) . then , calculations are carried out by replacing the usual product of functions in space - time by the @xmath22product@xmath23a similar @xmath22product formulation may be implemented for the algebra ( [ i.2 ] ) by replacing in ( [ i.5 ] ) @xmath21 by the operator @xmath24 and , to have a full @xmath22product formulation , using the moyal product for products of functions of coordinates and momenta .",
    "however the situation is quite different from the one implied by ( [ i.4 ] ) because @xmath25 is an operator , not a constant tensor deformation parameter .",
    "hence it does not lead to lorentz violation , the deformed algebras ( [ i.2]-[i.3 ] ) being consistent with preservation of lorentz invariance",
    ". therefore some of the tests proposed for ( [ i.4 ] ) are not relevant for ( [ i.3 ] ) .",
    "in addition the deformed algebras introduce a new non - trivial operator @xmath13 which replaces the central element of the heisenberg algebra . in particular",
    "this operator corresponds to an additional component in the most general connections compatible with ( [ i.3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "when the right - hand side of ( [ i.4 ] ) is a c - number @xmath21 , with dimensions of length - squared , it may be roughly interpreted as the smallest patch of area in the @xmath26plane that one may consider to be observable , like @xmath27 in @xmath28=i\\hslash \\delta _ { ij}$ ] may be interpreted as the smallest patch in phase space .",
    "however here the right - hand - side of the commutators is an operator and the interpretation is subtler .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the discussion of effects which might lead to actual experimental tests if @xmath9 is not too small .",
    "it must be pointed out that some of these effects , as it will be referred to in the appropriate places , may have already been suggested by other authors . nevertheless in most cases they are suggested in the framework of a simple time or space discreteness hypothesis , without the benefit of a full space - time algebra .",
    "for that reason some of the conclusions are different or more detailed .",
    "phase - space modifications , deviations from @xmath0 in speed measurements of massless wave packets , resonances , interference , electron spin resonance and non - commutative qed are considered .",
    "finally , in the appendix , some explicit representations of the space - time algebra are collected , which are useful for the calculations .",
    "if @xmath17 there is a phase space contraction effect at high energies .",
    "this was discussed in @xcite , being pointed out that it might relevant for the calculation of the gzk radius @xcite zatsepin . from the calculations in @xcite , the conclusion was that , whereas the value of the gzk cutoff would not be much changed , the radius of the gzk sphere would increase , allowing for more nucleons from farther distances to reach earth at energies above @xmath29ev . for this effect to be detectable the fundamental time should not be smaller than @xmath30 seconds .    here , further consequences of the phase - space modification are studied . both signs @xmath17 and @xmath19 are considered . in particular , if the conjecture that the scale @xmath9 is much larger than the planck s scale is true , such effects might already be observed at the energy of the existing colliders .    the modification of the density of states @xcite is obtained by computing how many available states a particle of momentum @xmath31 has , for example , in a scattering experiment .",
    "once the direction of @xmath31 is fixed , the problem becomes a one - dimensional problem , which may be dealt with by a subalgebra @xmath32 of ( [ i.3 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath33 and define hyperbolic coordinates in the plane @xmath34@xmath35then@xmath36one comparing with the representation ( [ a.8 ] ) one obtains@xmath37or , equivalently@xmath38for @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the classical result is obtained .",
    "hereafter let us consider @xmath39 .",
    "in the @xmath41basis the eigenvectors @xmath31 of the momentum @xmath42 are @xmath43 which , with vanishing boundary conditions on a box , has eigenvalues @xmath44corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    "therefore the number of states with momenta smaller than @xmath31 is@xmath46and the density of states is@xmath47for three dimensions , considering the number of independent states with absolute momentum less than @xmath48@xmath49leads to a density of states@xmath50    for @xmath19 the appropriate coordinates in the plane @xmath51 are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and one would obtain the opposite effect , namely the factor @xmath55 ) .",
    "therefore@xmath56@xmath57    the conclusion is that for @xmath17 there is a contraction of phase space increasing with energy and an expansion for @xmath19 , the cross sections being corrected by the new density of states ( [ ps5 ] ) and ( ps5a ) . for @xmath17 the suppression effect of the phase - space contraction on high energy reactions may be estimated by comparing the integral @xmath58with @xmath59 .",
    "this estimates the suppression effect on an high energy final state integral for total energy @xmath60 neglecting masses . changing variables one obtains @xmath61with @xmath62 .",
    "fig.[supress ] is a plot of the suppression function @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "one sees that the suppression effect decreases when the number of final particles increases .",
    "the phase space suppression effect implies that if cross section values found at low energies are used to predict the final states at higher energies , an increase in particle multiplicity will be found above the expected one .",
    "for @xmath19 the effect would be the opposite one , that is , a smaller multiplicity .",
    "one also sees that these effects will only become noticeable for @xmath65 .",
    "for example , an observation of the effects starting at around @xmath66 gev would imply @xmath67 or @xmath68 .      that the phase space volume modifications at high energies ( contraction for @xmath69 , dilatation for @xmath19 ) would also lead to statistical mechanics predictions",
    "was briefly mentioned in @xcite .",
    "this might , in particular , have some consequences for models of dense star matter . here",
    "i will analyze the modifications implied by the deformed algebra on the degeneracy pressure of a fermi gas .",
    "both the non - relativistic and the relativistic case will be analyzed . for a gas of nonrelativistic particles the kinetic energy @xmath70 is@xmath71for @xmath17 , changing variables in ( [ ps4 ] ) the density of states becomes@xmath72from@xmath73at @xmath74 , one obtains@xmath75 in leading @xmath76 order the energy and the pressure are@xmath77@xmath78leading to@xmath79    in the relativistic case , which is the one that is relevant , for example , for neutron star matter , the total energy density per unit volume is@xmath80and the pressure@xmath81with @xmath82 . writing @xmath83 and @xmath84 with the adimensional variables @xmath85 and @xmath86@xmath87@xmath88    in the fig.[pressure ] the ratios @xmath89 and @xmath90 are plotted for two @xmath91 values .",
    "one sees that the phase - space suppression ( @xmath17 ) implies a larger degeneracy pressure and a smaller total energy density for the same @xmath92 . however , ( in contrast with the effects that might seen at high energy colliders , as discussed above ) and for reasonable star matter densities the effect is probably too small to be observed .",
    "for example , with @xmath93 the neutron mass , a matter density of @xmath94 and @xmath95 one has @xmath96 but only @xmath97 .",
    "one sees from fig.[pressure ] that for these values the effect is extremely small .",
    "the corresponding results for the case @xmath19 are obtained by replacing @xmath98 by @xmath99 and @xmath100 by @xmath101 in the equations above .",
    "in the noncommutative context , because the space and the time coordinates can not be simultaneously diagonalized , speed can only be defined in terms of expectation values , for example@xmath102here , one considers a normalized state @xmath103 with a small dispersion of momentum around a central value @xmath104 . at time",
    "zero@xmath105where @xmath106 , @xmath107 standing for the quantum numbers associated to the little group of @xmath31 and @xmath108 a normalized function peaked around @xmath109 .    to obtain @xmath110 one should apply to @xmath111 the time - shift operator . however this is not @xmath112 because@xmath113follows from @xmath114 = i\\im   \\label{sw4}\\]]whereas a time - shift generator @xmath115 should satisfy@xmath116 = i\\mathbf{1 }   \\label{sw5}\\]]in order @xmath117 one may take@xmath118because@xmath116 = i\\left ( 1-\\ell ^{4}\\left ( p^{0}\\right ) ^{4}\\im ^{-4}\\right )   \\label{sw7}\\]]to obtain this result , use was made of @xmath119 = -i\\epsilon \\ell ^{2}p^{0}\\im ^{-2}$ ] , which follows from @xmath120 = 0 $ ] .",
    "here one uses a basis where the set @xmath121 is diagonalized and define@xmath122@xmath123 is the momentum in units of @xmath13 .    therefore up to the same @xmath117 order@xmath124    to compute the expectation value of @xmath125 one notices that from@xmath126using @xmath127 one obtains@xmath128@xmath129 meaning symmetrization of the operators .",
    "now the expectation value of this operator in the state @xmath110 is computed and taking the time derivative one obtains for the wave packet speed in order @xmath76@xmath130@xmath76 being small , this deviation from @xmath131 may be difficult to detect for massive particles given the uncertainty on the values of the mass .",
    "however , for massless particles the deviation from @xmath132@xmath133might already be possible to detect accurately with present experimental means @xcite .",
    "such deviation above or below the speed @xmath0 ( depending on the sign of @xmath11 ) would not imply any modification of the relativistic deformation constant @xmath134 , nor a breakdown of relativity .",
    "rather , it would be a manifestation of the noncommutative space - time structure .    for @xmath135 gev and @xmath136 ( or @xmath137 ) @xmath138 .",
    "some years ago ehrlich @xcite , finding a regularity in the resonance widths known at the time , conjectured that the widths might be quantized in multiples of some fundamental time unit .",
    "later , the same author @xcite using more recent data , pointed out that the quantization hypothesis of the resonance widths did not agree as well as before . nevertheless , the conjecture has its merit and deserves to be checked within the present framework . if the time quantization has a direct bearing on resonance widths it should already be apparent in simple potential models .",
    "consider the simple one dimensional potential displayed in fig.potential .",

    "it is @xmath146and in the relativistic case@xmath147    the resonances are associated to the complex zeros of @xmath148 , that is using ( [ 2.4 ] ) , to the zeros of the function@xmath149 in fig.[zeros ] the location of the zeros of @xmath150 are plotted for @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "one sees no evidence for the width of the resonances being quantized in multiples of @xmath9 . rather , the widths and separation of the resonances is related to the geometry of the problem .",
    "however , what one notices is that as @xmath9 approaches the scale of the problem , the resonances become extremely wide being , in practice , undetectable in the scattering amplitudes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[scatampl ] where the amplitude of @xmath154 is plotted .",
