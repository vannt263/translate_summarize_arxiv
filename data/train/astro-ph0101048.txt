    "kilohertz ( khz ) oscillations in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) were first discovered ( @xcite ; @xcite ) in observations with the proportional counter array ( pca ) onboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) have now been observed in the persistent flux of well over a dozen sources ( @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "these khz qpo sometimes occur in pairs whose difference frequency is not constant ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and show properties that are remarkably uniform over a wide range of accretion rates ( @xcite ) .",
    "some of these sources also show oscillations in the @xmath2 range that occur during type  i ( thermonuclear ) bursts ( @xcite ) .",
    "current models for khz qpos have explanations related to the inner portions of the accretion disk and the transition flow of matter onto the ns surface ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other alternatives focus on the motions of blobs of matter near the last stable orbit of a ns ( @xcite ) and propose evidence for lense - thirring precession of orbiting matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "the unique millisecond x - ray pulsar , sax  j1808.4 - 3658 , shows high q millisecond pulsations ( @xmath3 ) and a lack of khz qpos ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , pairs of khz qpo are not observed in sources with black holes ( @xcite ) indicating that the generation of khz qpo is likely related to a mechanism near the surface of the ns .    in this paper , we present the torque free precession ( tfp ) model for khz qpo observed in lmxb sources which relates the properties of the observed x - ray emissions from the surface of the ns over a wide range of accretion rates to the intrinsic properties of neutron star ( ns ) structure .",
    "this model is in strong contrast to existing models which primarily relate the khz qpo phenomenon to the physics of gas dynamics external to the ns surface .",
    "kilohertz oscillations are explained as a natural consequence of the spinup of a neutron star to near breakup due to sustained high rates of accretion . in this model ,",
    "the fluid core of the ns spins up due to accretion torques ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "further transfer of angular momentum to the ns causes the  crust \" of the ns to partially decouple from the core and rotate at a higher rate ( up to @xmath5 ) than the fluid core .",
    "the crust of the ns both rotates and undergoes torque free precession ( tfp ) as a rigid body : this causes a modulation of the x - ray emission from this observable outer region at a pair of frequencies in the khz band .",
    "we designate these frequencies as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the lower and upper khz qpo .",
    "these oscillations are quasi - periodic because of fluctuations in the moments of inertia of the outer region of the ns and possible exchange of angular momentum between the rigid crust and the fluid core .",
    "although the khz qpos observed in x - rays are the most well studied predictions of this model , most of the energy released is likely in the form of khz gravitational waves ( gw ) .",
    "the crust of the ns will undergo classical tfp in the absence of any accretion .",
    "torques due to the accretion flow or changes in the internal structure of the ns will modify the precession and rotation of the ns on a timescale which is slow compared to either the spin of the crust at frequency @xmath8 , the precession of the crust at frequency @xmath9 , or the spin of the fluid core at a frequency @xmath10 . for the purposes of the model proposed here , we identify the  rigid \" crust as that portion of the outer part of the ns which undergoes rotation and precession independently of the fluid core of the ns .",
    "the structure of the outer layers of a ns is divided into a surface layer at low density ( @xmath11 ) , an outer crust ( @xmath12 ) , and an inner crust ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "these layers are outside of an neutron fluid core at nuclear density ( @xmath14 ) . there may be an interior core region that is solid or some other form of matter distinct from a neutron liquid at even higher densities ( @xcite ) .",
    "the exact details of the ns structure are not important for the simple application of the tfp model .    simplifying these constructs , we refer to only two components , the  crust \" and the  core \" of the ns . in a latter section ,",
    "we identify the outer crust as the portion of the ns that undergoes tfp because the inner crust is likely melted in an accreting lmxb ns .",
    "we further assume that the crust is rigid and undergoes rotation and precession while the core is a fluid and only undergoes rotation .",
    "clearly there is a complex interface between the crust and core as well as time dependent deformations of the crust and core , and perhaps non - rotational differential flows in the fluid interior .",
    "all of these details are ignored in modeling the basic response of the ns to increasing angular momentum and approach to breakup conditions .",
    "let @xmath15 and @xmath16 be the parallel and perpendicular components of the moment of inertia of the crust of the ns as related to the rotational axis of the ns .",
    "we approximate the response of the crust of the ns to a variation in rotation rate by the following pair of equations where @xmath8 is the ns crust spin frequency and @xmath17 is the moment of inertia of the non - rotating crust . clearly , @xmath15 must equal @xmath16 in the limit of no rotation :    @xmath18 \\label{iparallel}\\ ] ]    @xmath19 \\label{iperp}\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are constants that characterize the response of the crust to rotation , in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the ns spin axis .",
    "we also define a dimensionless ratio ellipticity @xmath22 : @xmath23 } \\over { i_{c\\perp } } } \\label{epsilon_c}\\ ] ]    the ellipticity @xmath22 is related to the eccentricity @xmath24 by    @xmath25    where the eccentricity @xmath24 is defined as @xmath26 here @xmath27 indicates the equatorial radius of the ns and @xmath28 indicates the polar radius .",
    "the ns is assumed to have the shape of a oblate spheroid which is induced by rotation of the crust at frequency @xmath8 .",
    "note that in equation [ epsilon ] we have made the interpretation that the observed lower khz qpo frequency is the crust s precession frequency ( @xmath29 ) while the upper khz qpo frequency is the crust s spin frequency ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "equations [ epsilon_c ] and [ epsilon ] are consistent with tfp of a rigid body ( @xcite ) .    from the maclaurin sequence of the equilibrium figures of uniform rotation and density ( @xcite ) critical values of the ellipticity @xmath31 are determined as purely geometrical functions of the ratios of moments of inertia . in the following discussion @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( no subscripts )",
    "refer to the ellipticity and eccentricity respectively of a maclaurin spheroid defined analogously as the equations [ epsilon_c ] , [ epsilon ] and [ radius ] for the crust .",
    "generalizations ( @xcite ) of the maclaurin sequence indicate that the critical values of @xmath22 are approximately the same as those for @xmath31 , even in cases of non - uniform rotation and density .",
    "even if the surface shape of the ns does not match an ideal oblate spheroid , @xmath22 is still well defined as a function of the ratios of the moments of inertia .",
    "the critical values of ellipticity ( @xmath31 ) and also the eccentricity ( @xmath32 ) are often expressed as corresponding critical values of the ratio of kinetic energy ( @xmath33 ) to the absolute value of the potential energy ( @xmath34 ) designated @xmath35 .    considering a maclaurin sequence of increasing angular momentum",
    ", we first encounter a secular instability at @xmath36 .",
    "this first instability determines the maximum rotation of a ns for an assumed equation of state ( eos ) and mass .",
    "note that the values of eccentricity ( and also @xmath35 ) are slightly less than the critical value for the  normal \" sequence of maximally rotating ns computed by cook ( see table 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "this result is robust for all eos for which cook computed models .",
    "the next important critical value ( @xmath37 ) occurs at the state with the maximum possible rotation rate .",
    "beyond this point , increasing the angular momentum will not increase the rotation rate .",
    "this state does not indicate the onset of any instability , but rather reflects the fact that the system has reached its maximum possible spin for a rigid internal structure .",
    "the next critical value ( @xmath38 ) occurs when the rotating rigid body becomes dynamically unstable because of the rapid growth of nonradial toroidal modes .",
    "any rotating system , including a rigid body , is unlikely to maintain a value of eccentricity greater than 0.9529 .",
    "recall that we have previously associated the precession frequency of the ns crust ( @xmath9 ) with the observed lower khz qpo frequency ( @xmath6 ) , and the spin frequency of the crust ( @xmath8 ) with the upper khz qpo frequency ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "for the conditions considered here the accretion is likely higher onto a large equatorial region of the crust .",
    "the polar regions of the crust likely rotate with interior fluid which is observed in type  i bursts from lmxb nss ( see a later section for more discussion of this possibility ) . at low angular momentum ,",
    "the fluid and crust rotate together as a single rigid body at the spin frequency @xmath39 . as the angular momentum",
    "is increased , the ns reaches the critical internal state which results in the partial decoupling of an equatorial portion of the crust from the interior of the ns .",
    "the details of this internal change in the ns structure are likely due to heating of the inner crust due to nuclear burning associated with the accretion of matter onto the ns surface and subsequent migration to deeper layers of the ns .",
    "this catastrophic event will occur at a unique spin for a particular ns among an uncertain range of spin frequencies depending on the details of the history of accretion .",
    "since we have no quantitative theoretical model we identify a plausible range as @xmath40 for consistency with observations of nco in type  i bursts and the possibility that z - sources have spins as high as @xmath41 .",
    "the details of this event are discussed in a later section .",
    "for the discussion here , we only need assume that a portion of the crust has been reduced in mass ( @xmath42 ) and is less coupled to the ns fluid interior . we will show later that the eos of the ns is such that at the time just prior to the catastrophic event , the shape of the ns has an eccentricity @xmath43 and is a stable .",
    "subsequent to the decoupling of the outer crust from the interior of the ns , this part of the crust begins to rotate at a spin frequency different and higher than the fluid core . in this context",
    ", the descriptive term decouple means that the interaction of the crust ( reduced in mass ) with the ns interior is sufficiently weak that an equatorial portion of the crust can rotate and precess independently from the ns fluid core .",
    "clearly there is still a significant interaction between the crust and core",
    ". the crust will experience torques due to both accretion and internal changes in the ns .",
    "since the crust is reduced in mass , its spin can more easily be changed .",
    "the torques due to accretion are not large enough to change the spin of the crust by a large amount ( @xmath44 to @xmath45 ) .",
    "however , internal changes in the ns will produce torques on the crust that can significantly spin the crust up or down .",
    "the crust will always spin faster than the fluid core .",
    "therefore the spin frequency of the fluid core ( @xmath10 ) is less than the minimum value of the frequency of the upper khz qpo ( @xmath7 ) in each particular source .",
    "as the crust spins up its shape will change due to a continuous elastic response . as the crust reaches a spin frequency of @xmath46 and an eccentricity @xmath47 it approaches the onset of a secular instability .",
    "the response of the crust to this secular instability is the likely initiation of tfp .",
    "this transition near @xmath46 is supported by observations of 4u1728 - 34 and 4u1608 - 52 that show both khz qpo for @xmath48 but only the upper khz qpo for @xmath49 ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the crust now both spins and precesses over a range of spin frequencies @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , while the fluid core continues to rotate near the same rate that it had just prior to decoupling of the equatorial crust .",
    "the ns does not  break up \" as a single body but rather breaks into two separate bodies .",
    "the core is a fluid which rotates but does not precess , while the  rigid \" crust rotates and precesses .",
    "this motion of the crust leads to the appearance of the pair of khz qpo at the rotation frequency of the crust @xmath52 and the precession frequency of the crust @xmath53 .",
    "as @xmath8 increases to @xmath5 , the crust reaches the next critical value of eccentricity @xmath54 which corresponds to the maximum rotation rate of the rigid crust that will allow both rotation and precession to occur . as the rotation rate increases higher than @xmath5 toward slightly greater values ( @xmath45 which corresponds to @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the crust approaches dynamical instability which quenches its precession .",
    "an alternative and perhaps more likely scenario is that for spins above @xmath5 the equatorial crustal material and the plasma atmosphere above the crust are moving very close to escape velocity of the ns and may merge with orbiting material at the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "the upper khz qpo in the frequency range @xmath56 may be caused by orbital motion hence the lack of tfp and a missing lower khz qpo .",
    "when this spin / orbital frequency reaches @xmath45 the accretion disk and crust come into contact which results in the cessation of the upper khz qpo .",
    "at this state of maximum angular momentum , the fluid core is still rotating at frequency @xmath10 ( some value in the range @xmath4 ) while the crust is rotating at @xmath8 ( @xmath5 ) . for greater angular momenta",
    ", the entire ns system ( crust and core ) can no longer rotate as two bodies .",
    "also the surface of the crust is moving at a speed near the escape velocity .",
    "further increases in angular momentum are likely to lead to mass ejection or the real  breakup \" of the ns .",
    "the decoupling of the crust from the core at spin frequencies @xmath4 stalls the further spinup of the ns while the equatorial crust spins up to @xmath5 . at this point",
    "the ns ( crust and core ) has reached the breakup state .",
    "the successful quantification of the tfp model is confirmed by fitting the observed frequencies of the khz qpo from sco x-1 .",
    "we can approximately model the moments of inertia of the crust ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) as a response to rotation at frequency @xmath8 as a linear increase from an initial value at zero rotation ( @xmath17 ) as shown in equations [ iparallel ] and [ iperp ] .",
    "the fixed free parameters in this model are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath17 .",
    "the value of @xmath22 defined by equation [ epsilon_c ] is independent of the value of @xmath17 since it only depends on ratios of moments of inertia .",
    "equation [ epsilon ] relates the moments of inertia to the ratio of the lower and upper frequencies of the khz qpo with the interpretation that the upper frequency is the spin frequency of the crust ( @xmath57 ) and the lower frequency is the precession frequency of the crust ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we use this model to fit the data for scox-1 and thereby empirically determine the values for @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these values are computed by a @xmath61 fit to the 38 pairs of measurements of @xmath62 and @xmath7 for sco  x-1 with two free parameters and @xmath63 error bars ( @xmath64 ) derived according to @xcite .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath61 is 92.4 for 34 degrees of freedom .",
    "this fit is of similar quality to that from @xcite and implies systematic errors @xmath65 times larger than the statistical errors .",
    "the value of @xmath17 is not determined by the fit .",
    "this fit is shown in figure 1 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the fit to the data by the tfp model ( solid line ) as well as the phenomenological equation of @xcite ( dashed line ) .",
    "the fits are similar ; however for the tfp model we are fitting a dynamical model rather than a phenomenological function . in panel",
    "( a ) , the data point near the abscissa value of @xmath66 is obtained from observations of gx  5 - 1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "it has not been included in the fit for @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but is included in the figure to demonstrate that the tfp model appears to fit the data over the full observed range of @xmath7 ( @xmath67 ) with @xmath62 present . in panel",
    "( b ) we show an expanded view of the sco  x-1 data and the models .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the ordinate as the difference frequency of the khz qpo as usually shown in prior work ( @xcite and references therein ) .    in panels ( c ) and ( d )",
    "we show the same data and the tfp model fit with the ordinate as the ratio @xmath68 which is equal to the ellipticity of the crust @xmath22 .",
    "again the tfp model is the solid curve which is shown to match the sco  x-1 data and the single point from gx5 - 1 .",
    "panel ( d ) is the same as panel ( c ) at an expanded scale showing a better view of the sco  x-1 data .",
    "panel ( c ) also shows horizontal dotted lines for the critical values of the eccentricity of the crust .",
    "also shown in panel ( c ) is one curve that correspond to a particular model of a rotating ns .",
    "the model uses the specific eos fps ( @xcite ) for a ns of mass @xmath69 taken from a computation in @xcite .",
    "given the interpretation of the model proposed here , the curve for the real eos lies below the solid curve for all values of @xmath7 . by inspection of table 15 from @xcite",
    ", it can be shown that the ratio of the radius of a ns at maximum spin is close to @xmath70 times the radius at zero spin .",
    "similarly the decoupled crust also increases its equatorial radius by @xmath71 as it approachs maximum spin .",
    "this result is consistent with the condition @xmath72 which from equation [ iparallel ] means that the moment of inertia of the crust has doubled corresponding to an increase in the equatorial radius by a @xmath71 . in other words ,",
    "the radius of the decoupled crust at maximum spin is nearly the same as the radius that the ns would have at maximum spin if the crust did not decouple .",
    "the condition that the rotating and precessing crust must be outside the radius of the fluid core mean that the eos of the ns must have a maximum spin greater than @xmath5 . since observations support the contact on the inner edge of the accretion disk with the equatorial crust at maximum spin of the crust @xmath73 therefore the eos of the ns must have a maximum spin less than @xmath45 and likely close to @xmath5 .",
    "of all the eos considered by @xcite , eos fps is closest to matching this requirement .",
    "of the polytropes considered in @xcite only the index @xmath74 matches this requirement .",
    "if the tfp model is correct , then the eos of a ns is tightly constrained within a range that is comparable to the systematic errors in the computation of the structure of a rotating ns .",
    "the best fit polytrope for the interior of a ns has an index @xmath75 likely within @xmath76 of @xmath77 .",
    "the empirical relationship in equation [ polytrope ] relates the value of the polytropic index @xmath75 to the maximum spin frequency @xmath78 of a ns with a mass @xmath79 .",
    "this equation is derived from equation 31 and the data in table 3 from @xcite . for a @xmath80 ns and assumimg",
    "@xmath78 is equal to the maximum value of @xmath81 with a simultaneous measurement of @xmath6 yields a value @xmath82 . if the masses of the ns in an lmxb are as high as @xmath83 then @xmath84 .",
    "the basic conclusion of a tightly constrained eos with @xmath85 still holds .",
    "@xmath86 \\label{polytrope}\\ ] ]    in panel ( d ) we show an expanded view of the sco  x-1 data . note that the maximum value of @xmath7 at @xmath87 corresponds to the critical value of @xmath54 .",
    "the dashed curve in panels ( c ) and ( d ) shows the locus for a maclaurin spheroid that just passes through these points at maximum spin with precession .",
    "the mass ( @xmath69 ) and radius ( @xmath88 km ) of the spheroid is approximately correct for nominal values of a ns .",
    "the upper khz qpo from sco  x-1 has been observed at values greater than @xmath89 but without the presence of the lower khz qpo .",
    "the model suggests that the maximum spin rate without precession present ( missing lower khz qpo ) would occur at a frequency @xmath90 which is determined by the intersection of the @xmath91 line with the solid curve .",
    "this point marks an upper limit for the breakup frequency of the ns in the context of the tfp model .",
    "an alternative , and more likely interpretation , is that the true breakup frequency of full ns ( core and crust ) is closer to @xmath89 .",
    "the observed upper khz qpo in the frequency range @xmath56 ( without the lower khz qpo ) marks a transition region in which the outer crust and the ns plasma atmosphere are moving near escape velocity and are merging with the inner edge of the accretion which has a matching keplerian velocity .",
    "full merger of the outer crust with the inner edge of the accretion disk marks the cessation of the upper khz qpo .    in panel ( c ) a vertical dot - dash line is plotted at a frequency @xmath92 , which is the spin frequency of sax  j1808.4 - 3658 , the millisecond x - ray pulsar discovered by @xcite .",
    "the locus for eos fps intersects the line for this pulsar near @xmath93 . for the eos fps the radius of the ns varies from @xmath94 km",
    "( see table 12 in @xcite ) . for a @xmath95 ns with @xmath96 ( or @xmath97 )",
    "the radius as set by eos fps is @xmath98 km in agreement with the upper limit @xmath99 km suggested by @xcite .",
    "a high q pulsar such as sax  j1808.4 - 3658 has not reached the condition for melting the inner crust . in the context of the tfp model",
    "such a high q pulsar would never show khz qpo .",
    "also the millisecond radio pulsar psr  1937 + 214 discovered by @xcite has a spin frequency of @xmath100 .",
    "the high q of this pulsar is consistent with the lack of accretion and a solid inner crust .",
    "perhaps this radio pulsar once had a melted inner crust and significant accretion rate and has since reformed a solid inner crust after cooling subsequent to a cessation of accretion .",
    "the correctness of the tfp model is strongly supported by the the consistent prediction of the sequence of khz qpo observed in lmxb sources .",
    "the angular momentum transfer via accretion is too small to drive a large variation in the spin of the outer crust ( @xmath101 ) over a short period ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "any realistic and complete tfp model requires a mechanism that taps a small fraction of the large reservoir of both rotational energy and angular momentum of a rapidly spinning ns that drives the outer crust to vary in spin frequency .",
    "we suggest that the controlling mechanism is related to giant glitches observed in radio pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "initially the ns is spinning up due to the accretion of material onto the surface of the outer crust . over a long accretion",
    "timescale the outer and inner crust are repeatedly replenished .",
    "@xcite has calculated detailed models for the equilibrium structure of the crust in such a accreting source . for a sufficiently high accretion rates ( @xmath103 ) ,",
    "brown s model predicts that the temperature in the inner crust is independent of the surface temperature of the ns . just below the layer beginning at onset of neutron drip , the boundary between the outer and inner crust , the nuclear reactions heat the interior of the inner crust .",
    "most of this heat is conducted into the core of the ns .",
    "brown s model suggests that the inner crust will melt for a sufficiently high accretion rate .",
    "the fall of the average value of z in the inner crust also lowers the melting temperature of this layer as well .",
    "also the presence of any r - mode driven by the rapid spin of the ns will heat the boundary - layer between the fluid core and inner crust ( @xcite ) and further raise the temperature of the inner crust .",
    "this scenario leads to the possibility of melting the inner crust .",
    "however for rates as high as 5 times eddington the outer crust may not melt ( see figure 10 of @xcite ) .",
    "the conductivity of the outer crust is low compared to that for the inner crust ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "we suggest that the onset of tfp occurs when the inner crust melts leaving the outer crust as a solid .",
    "the spin of the ns star at the time when the inner crust melts will vary depending on the history of the accretion rate , the detailed structure of the inner and outer crust , and the presence of any additional non - nuclear heating sources ( for example an r - mode ) .",
    "the onset of melting of the inner crust is consistent with a range of spin rates of the fluid core seen in type  i bursts ( @xmath40 ) . in the tfp model",
    "only the equatorial portion of the outer crust of the ns spins up and down ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "large polar regions of the ns outer crust continue to spin with the interior fluid core .",
    "a later section contains a more detailed discussion of the implications of the tfp model for observations of type  i bursts in lmxb sources .",
    "once the inner crust melts then the outer crust can undergo tfp driven by a mechanism that taps internal ns rotational energy .",
    "we suggest that a likely candidate for this mechanism is similar to that proposed to explain giant glitches in radio pulsars ( @xcite ) .",
    "these giant glitches are observed to cause discrete jumps in the spin period of the outer crust that correspond to a changes in angular momentum of the a large portion of the ns .",
    "the size of the giant glitch in vela is @xmath104 expressed as the fractional change in the spin frequency before and after the glitch .",
    "the energy source for the giant glitches is likely a internal superfluid component which has a moment of inertia , @xmath105 , as measured by the fractional change of the spin s first derivative before and after the giant glitch , where @xmath106 is nearly the total moment of inertia of the ns .",
    "both of these parameters are determined by radio observations of giant glitches in the spin of a ns and are not based on any theoretical models of ns interiors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the energetics of this `` glitch '' in the spin rate of an lmxb ns is somewhat larger than a giant glitch in a radio pulsar .",
    "this possibility is not that extreme since a lmxb ns is spinning @xmath107 times faster than the radio pulsars ( vela ) for which the giant glitches are measured .",
    "we suggest that the `` glitch '' in an lmxb likely scales as the period of rotation yielding an estimate of the fractional change in the total angular momentum @xmath108 .",
    "if the superfluid transfers a large fraction of this stored angular momentum to the solid outer crust ( @xmath109 ) then a small differential in the spin of the superfluid ( @xmath110 ) compared to the spin of the core of the ns ( @xmath40 ) would cause a large change in the spin of the outer crust ( from @xmath40 to @xmath5 ) since the ratio of the moment of inertia of the outer crust to that of the superfuild layer is @xmath111 .",
    "also the timescale for recovery from a giant glitch in radio pulsars is order @xmath112 .",
    "this long timescale is likely due to low viscosity in the superfuild layer .",
    "theoretical estimates for this timescale are uncertain but may also scale with the period of rotation ( see equation 36 in @xcite ) . therefore in an lmxb",
    "ns spinning @xmath107 times faster than the vela pulsar , the glitch recovery time would become @xmath113 .",
    "we suggest that the outer crust spins up and down rapidly ( @xmath114 ) on a timescale of @xmath115 due to the pinning and unpinning of vortices in a superfluid layer within the ns .",
    "this superfluid layer ( which includes the melted inner crust ) likely has an interface at the base of the outer crust where it interacts via slow viscous effects .",
    "this allows the outer crust to undergo tfp on a fast timescale ( @xmath116 ) while exchanging angular momentum with the superfluid reservoir on a slow timescale ( @xmath117hours ) .",
    "this exchange of angular momentum proceeds in a limit - cycle that is observed in the spin and precession of outer crust .",
    "this process results in a rapid changes in the spin and shape of the outer crust and is consistent with the observed qs of the khz qpo .",
    "the random meander of this limit - cycle ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) is associated with the pinning and unpinning of vortices in the superfluid with resulting discrete interaction with the outer crust .",
    "these interactions induce changes in the both the parallel and perpendicular components of the moments of inertia of the outer crust and excite tfp .",
    "some of the unpinned superfluid likely rotates with the outer crust up to @xmath5 .",
    "this superfluid then repins with the pinned superfuild causing the spin down of the outer crust . since the outer crust in an lxmb ns",
    "is weakly coupled to the interior of the ns as compared to the crust of a ns in a radio pulsar , the manifestation of the observed `` glitch '' is slow both going up and down in an lmxb ns .",
    "in addition the accretion onto the surface of the outer crust also causes torques which excite tfp .",
    "the outer crust is also continuously elastically responding to the changes in the internal strain .",
    "these internal adjustments also contribute to fluctuations in the components of the moments of inertia and the excitation of tfp .",

    "<S> the basic theory of torque free precession ( tfp ) of the outer crust of a neutron star ( ns ) as the signature of the approach to ns breakup is a viable explanation of the uniform properties of khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpo ) observed in x - rays emitted by low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) sources . </S>",
    "<S> the theory outlined in this paper relates the intrinsic properties of ns structure to the observed khz frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the range of khz frequencies and the observed quality factors ( qs ) are also explained by this simple dynamical model . a scenario that begins with the melting of the inner crust of an lmxb ns creates the conditions necessary for the generation of khz qpo . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that a mechanism analogous to that proposed to explain giant glitches in radio pulsars drives the dynamics of variations of the khz qpo . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the theory provides a simple explanation for the high q of the unique millisecond x - ray pulsar sax  j1808.4 - 3658 , and also explains why it does not exhibit khz qpo . </S>",
    "<S> the theory relates the ratio of the observed khz frequencies to the ratios of the components of the moments of inertia of the ns , thereby tightly constraining the equation of state ( eos ) of ns matter ( polytrope index @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tfp model is in strong contrast to existing models which primarily relate the khz qpo phenomenon to the physics of gas dynamics near the inner edge of the accretion disk and the transition flow onto the surface of the ns . </S>",
    "<S> the tfp theory is consistent with the presence of lense - thirring precession of matter orbiting the ns . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the possibility of the direct detection of very low frequency ( @xmath1 khz ) radio waves from magnetic dipole radiation and also predict khz gravitational wave emission from the lmxb sco  x-1 that may be detectable by ligo . </S>",
    "<S> the high accretion rates consistent with the predicted gw emission indicate the likely conversion of some lmxbs to maximally rotating kerr black holes ( bh ) and further suggest that these systems are progenitors of some gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) . </S>"
