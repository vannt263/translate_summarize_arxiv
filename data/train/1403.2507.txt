    "the electron correlations and the configurational disorder , although different in the origin and in the way they manifest themselves , have in common that they hinder free propagation of electrons in metals .",
    "when sufficiently strong they both may lead to a metal - insulator transition .",
    "there are two types of the metal - insulator transition at zero temperature .",
    "the first one is the so - called mott - hubbard transition at which the density of electrons on the fermi energy vanishes .",
    "the second one is the anderson localization transition at which the electron diffusion vanishes but the density of states at the fermi energy remains nonzero .",
    "the latter transition is , however , driven entirely by the configurational disorder and will not be addressed in this paper .",
    "the early ideas that electron correlations in chemically homogeneous materials may lead to a metal - insulator transition came from mott.@xcite first quantitative scenarios of a correlation - induced metal - insulator transition were proposed by hubbard and gutzwiller .",
    "the former picture is based on a self - consistent theory of conduction electrons effectively scattered on other thermally equilibrated localized electrons with the opposite spin .",
    "multiple scatterings on the localized electrons then lead to repulsion of the electron states from the fermi energy and eventually to a metal - insulator transition.@xcite the latter approach uses a variational method in which electron correlations reduce the width of the otherwise undeformed energy band . a metal - insulator transition",
    "is then signaled by vanishing of the bandwidth.@xcite the two scenarios for the correlation - driven metal - insulator transition are non - critical , all characteristic parameters are continuous and bounded at the transition .",
    "there is no divergence in the spectral or response functions .",
    "they hence describe a transition from a metal to a band insulator but not to a mott insulator where the self - energy has a pole at the fermi energy .",
    "neither of these two pictures reflects reality , since they both completely neglect dynamical fluctuations that interfere these static scenarios by the kondo effect present in the local fermi liquid.@xcite a reliable theory of the correlation - induced metal - insulator transition without any symmetry breaking in fermi liquids must hence cope with this dynamical effect .",
    "a resolution to the problem of the correlation - induced metal - insulator transition was offered for the hubbard model a few decades ago by the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft).@xcite this approximation becomes exact in infinite spatial dimensions and contains the kondo asymptotics of the single - impurity anderson model .",
    "but in addition to the kondo physics it contains a self - consistency between the impurity ( local fermi liquid ) and the surrounding metallic environment that can suppress the kondo peak and enforce an insulating state . there is , however , only numerical evidence for the existence of a metal - insulator transition within the dynamical mean - field theory and a comprehensive analytic solution is still missing.@xcite    unlike the hubbard model , that can not be solved analytically , a simpler falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) allows for an analytic solution in infinite dimensions .",
    "its infinite - dimensional solution resembles that of the hubbard approximation for the metal - insulator transition , called hubbard iii.@xcite the falicov - kimball model is not a fermi liquid and it is free of the kondo effect .",
    "it was explicitly shown that it displays a metal - insulator transition on a bethe lattice.@xcite the transition at half filling is critical with a divergence of the self - energy.@xcite even in this model , however , a detailed critical asymptotics of the self - energy and the spectral functions at this metal - insulator transition is missing .    a metal - insulator transition , similar in properties to the mott - hubbard transition , is known also in disordered systems where it is called a split - band transition .",
    "it is described reliably by the coherent - potential , mean - field , approximation.@xcite a similarity between the mott - hubbard and the metal - insulator transition in a binary alloy was unveiled in ref .  .",
    "the split - band transition is generally not critical , it means there are no divergences at the transition point .",
    "it occurs when the chemical potential reaches one of the edges of the renormalized band at which the imaginary part of the self - energy vanishes .",
    "the exception to it is the split - band transition for the symmetric distributions of the random potential . in this case",
    "the transition is marked by a divergence of the self - energy .",
    "this is the feature that is shared with the mott - hubbard transition .",
    "it is hence apparent that a unified and universal description of the mott - hubbard and the metal - insulator transition in random systems with the diverging self - energy should exist .",
    "the mott - hubbard transition can be fully described with one - electron functions , the self - energy and the local green function .",
    "generally , continuous phase transitions are marked by singularities in response functions , that is , two - particle quantities .",
    "it is argued that the local spin susceptibility diverges at the mott - hubbard transition.@xcite there is no two - particle function that would diverge at the metal - insulator transition in the disordered falicov - kimball model .",
    "there is , however , a singularity in a two - particle irreducible vertex prior the metal - insulator transition is reached.@xcite this singularity is not , however , connected with a symmetry breaking , a long - range order , or a non - analytic behavior of measurable quantities .",
    "it is an indicator of proximity of a metal - insulator transition as discussed recently in the hubbard as well as the falicov - kimball models.@xcite the exact quantitative relation between the singularity in the two - particle irreducible vertex and the singularity of the self - energy at the metal - insulator transition has not yet been demonstrated .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find the explicit low - frequency asymptotics of spectral functions at the metal - insulator transition characterized by the diverging imaginary part of the self - energy and to clarify its relation to a singularity in the two - particle irreducible vertex in the disordered falicov - kimball model .",
    "this model combines the effects of electron correlations and disorder and allows for a solution in the mean - field limit , exact solution on an infinite - dimensional lattice .",
    "we set the conditions for the existence of this type of the metal - insulator transition for general input parameters , such as the density of states of the conduction electrons , band filling , and the type of the disorder distribution .",
    "we further demonstrate that the singularity in the two - particle irreducible vertex always precedes the divergence in the self - energy .",
    "although we study a model that is not a fermi liquid , our analysis unveils universal features of the metal - insulator transition with the diverging self - energy that are transferable also on the mott - hubbard transition , if it exists , in models of the strongly correlated local fermi liquid .",
    "the falicov - kimball model describes noninteracting electrons being scattered on a static , but spatially inhomogeneous atomic potential of ions forming a regular crystalline lattice .",
    "we consider the basic version of the spinless single - orbital falicov - kimball model and take into account only one type of the extended ( conduction ) and one type of the localized electrons .",
    "we further assume homogeneity in the distribution of the localized electrons and hence the noninteracting part of the hamiltonian describing such a situation reads    [ eq : fk - hamiltonian ] @xmath0 we are interested in the dynamical properties of the delocalized electrons induced by the fluctuations of the atomic potential the conduction electrons feel . to this purpose",
