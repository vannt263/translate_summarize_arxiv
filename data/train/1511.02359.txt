    "stability of electron current layers is a long standing topic in theoretical plasma physics .",
    "the typical electron current layers are found to be formed in many physical situations like , fast z - pinches @xcite , collision less magnetic reconnection @xcite , fast ignition phenomena of laser fusion @xcite , plasma opening devices @xcite , inter planetary current - carrying plasmas @xcite etc .",
    "these current layers having equilibrium length scale smaller than the ion skin depth are prone to various current - gradient driven instabilities under which they evolve , sometimes to the point of complete destruction . in typical electron current layers ,",
    "current flows faster than the alfven velocity and the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) model is not applicable .",
    "the stability of these current layers has been studied using electron magnetohydrodynamic ( emhd ) model of plasmas @xcite .",
    "emhd is a single fluid description of plasma which describes the dynamics of electron only by ignoring the ion response .",
    "emhd model has proven to be very convenient in describing numerous phenomena occurring at fast time and short length scale where mhd is not applicable .",
    "a rich literature on this model is available , which can be found elsewhere . here",
    ", we will discuss applicability of this model to describe the current gradient driven instabilities .",
    "the current - gradient driven instabilities in the framework of emhd have been previously considered by califano et al .",
    "@xcite , where they have been broadly categorized as tearing and bending instabilities depending upon the orientation of perturbations relative to the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "the classification can be understood from fig .",
    "the perturbations propagating along the direction of flow ( perpendicular to magnetic field ) give rise to the excitation of kelvin helmholtz ( kh ) like modes @xcite , which bends the flow lines and leads to the formation of vortex structures .",
    "this mode is known to play the role in stability of vortices generated by the interaction of ultra intense laser pulse with a plasma @xcite , generation of small scale turbulence @xcite , anomalous stopping of the energetic electron beam in fast ignition @xcite etc .",
    "the other choice of perturbations ( i.e. propagating along the magnetic field ) gives excitation to the collisionless tearing instability @xcite of thin current sheets which leads to the magnetic reconnection in the presence of electron inertia .",
    "apart from these tearing - bending instabilities , an inertial scale instability is known which also falls in the category of current - gradient driven instabilities @xcite .",
    "this mode shares the geometry of tearing mode [ fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ] , but unlike the tearing mode it is a local mode and does not require reversed equilibrium magnetic field configuration .",
    "this mode preserves the surface of magnetic flux .",
    "henceforth , this mode shall be referred to as non - tearing mode . in the study presented here",
    ", we suppress the kh mode by not considering the perturbations along the flow direction .",
    "hence our study is two dimensional with perturbations confined in the plane containing the magnetic field and gradient directions .    in the literature",
    ", the tearing mode has been studied for a 1d magnetic field profile , @xmath2 , which is a harris current sheet @xcite with thickness @xmath3 . for this choice of profile , as we will see , one of the conditions for non - tearing mode , @xmath4 ( see @xcite ) is not satisfied and hence the non - tearing mode was not present in the earlier studies of tearing mode . in order to study",
    "the non - tearing mode lukin @xcite used the harris current sheet equilibrium but up - shifted so that @xmath5 everywhere and the condition @xmath4 is satisfied . in the studies by jain et al .",
    "@xcite and gaur et al .",
    "@xcite also , the magnetic profile had the definite sign ( @xmath6 everywhere ) and the non - tearing mode was present . however , in these studies , due to the absence of null - line in the magnetic field profile , the tearing mode was not present .",
    "thus , so far , the two modes have not been investigate simultaneously in the same system .",
    "here , we study the two modes simultaneously present in the same system for a suitably tailored 1d magnetic field profile .",
    "the paper has been organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly discuss the model used and the equilibrium configuration of the system .",
    "iii contains linear instability analysis where we discuss the stability conditions of the two modes .",
    "section iv presents the results of nonlinear simulations that we carried out to understand the nonlinear state when two modes are operative separately and simultaneously .",
    "section v summarizes our work .",
    "the emhd model works for the phenomena involving the fast time scales @xmath7 and short spatial scales @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is the debye radius , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the gyro and plasma frequencies respectively and @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the larmor radius and skin depth respectively .",
    "subscripts @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the electron and ion species of plasma . at these scales",
    "the ions can be assumed to be static and unmagnetized .",
    "thus , the emhd equations are obtained from combined set of electron fluid equations and the maxwell s equations .",
    "the emhd model can be described by the following set of dimensionless equations , @xmath16    \\nonumber   \\\\ \\vec{v_e } & = & -\\vec{\\nabla } \\times \\vec{b } \\label{emhd_eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the length scale has been normalized by electron skin depth @xmath17 , magnetic field by a typical magnitude concerning any problem , e.g. @xmath18 , the time has been normalized by the electron cyclotron period corresponding to the normalizing magnetic field @xmath18 .",
    "the first equation represents the evolution of generalized vorticity @xmath19 . here",
    ", @xmath20 is the vector potential .",
    "second equation is ampere s law in which displacement current has been ignored by taking , @xmath21 . under this assumption",
    "the density fluctuations are ignored @xmath22 and the condition of quasi - neutrality demands the incompressibility of electron fluid i.e. @xmath23 . moreover ,",
    "the electron ion collisions have also been ignored .    in two dimensions ( with variation along @xmath24 only ) with the use of @xmath25 condition the total magnetic field can be expressed as , @xmath26 .",
    "the corresponding electron velocity would be expressed as , @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the above set of emhd equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ emhd_eq ] ) ] can be cast in terms of the evolution of two scalars , @xmath28    the equilibrium of eq .",
    "( [ 2d_emhd ] ) is defined as follows .",
    "we choose , @xmath29 . with this and choice of one dimensional equilibrium , eq .",

    "( [ eqb ] ) further gives , @xmath34 here , @xmath35 ; @xmath36^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the constants and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are some arbitrary functions .",
    "thus , we choose an equilibrium sheared magnetic field @xmath41 .",
    "this corresponds to a sheared electron flow directed along @xmath42 axis as , @xmath43",
    ". this choice would exclude the kh modes in our system as there are no variations along the equilibrium velocity .",
    "we linearize the emhd equations [ eqs .",
    "( [ 2d_emhd ] ) ] about the above equilibrium .",
    "since the equilibrium is the function of @xmath44 only , we take fourier transform in @xmath45 and @xmath46 to obtain the following set of linearized equations , @xmath47",
    "in this section we analyze the set of coupled linearized equations ( [ lin_emhd ] ) obtained in the previous section to understand the growth rate and eigen functions of tearing and non - tearing modes .",
    "we solve the eqs .",
    "( [ lin_emhd ] ) numerically as a matrix eigen value problem for @xmath48    where , @xmath3 is shear width and @xmath49 is a uniform magnetic field added externally in the direction of tangent hyperbolic field .",
    "the presence of this magnetic field does not disturb the equilibrium , however , it shifts / removes the null - point in the profile depending upon its magnitude [ fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ] .",
    "we numerically obtain the growth rate as eigen values for different choices of @xmath49 .",
    "we would like to point out here that the modes with value of @xmath50 would be termed as pure tearing modes and the modes with value of @xmath51 as pure non - tearing modes .",
    "modes with value of @xmath52 would be the mixed modes .",
    "we would make this nomenclature clear later in this section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot the growth rate as a function of @xmath53 .",
    "the three different curves correspond to different values of @xmath49 .",
    "the growth rate for pure tearing case ( i.e. @xmath54 ) is nonlocal i.e. only modes with @xmath55 are unstable .",
    "all the local modes ( with @xmath56 ) are stable . however , as the value of @xmath49 is made finite , local modes are also become unstable . for the case",
    "@xmath57 , the growth rate curve shows a dip and then saturates at higher @xmath53 values . for the case",
    "@xmath58 , the growth rate curve shows no dip .",
    "this is the case when magnetic field has no null - line and the tearing mode is absent .",
    "the growth rate curve saturates in the local region and becomes independent of @xmath53 .",
    "this behavior is consistent with studies of lukin @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ figc ] , we show the surface plot of growth rate as a function of @xmath59 and @xmath49 .",
    "this plot shows that the growth rate of local modes first increases with @xmath49 and then vanishes for some @xmath60 .    in fig .",
    "[ eigfn ] we plot the eigenfunctions of pure tearing and pure non - tearing modes in the left and right panels respectively .",

    "the structure is asymmetric around @xmath62 both in @xmath61 and @xmath63 .      assuming that the perturbation scales ( @xmath64 ) are sharper than the equilibrium scales",
    ", we can take the fourier transform of eqs.([lin_emhd ] ) along @xmath44 also and obtain the dispersion relation as follows , @xmath65 here @xmath66 .",
