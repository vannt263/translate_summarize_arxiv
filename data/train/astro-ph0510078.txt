    "on 2004 september 11 , the all - sky automated survey @xcite detected the transient object asas j002511 + 1217.2 ( @xmath4 : 00h 25 m 11.4s , @xmath5 + 12@xmath6 17 14.3 \" , j2000 ) , a source not previously known to be variable ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "it was later found that the object at this position had previously been detected by rosat ( 1rxs j002510.8 + 121725 ; @xcite ) and had been identified as a blue point source in the hamburg quasar survey @xcite .",
    "amateur and professional astronomers from around the world began observing this object , and tracked its behavior for two months following the initial detection .",
    "time - series spectra of asas j002511 + 1217.2 were obtained late in the outburst on jd 2,453,288 ( 2004 october 10 ) using the apache point observatory 3.5-meter telescope .",
    "the spectra , obtained over a span of two hours , show radial velocity variations consistent with an orbital period of approximately 82 minutes .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic behavior of this object is clearly that of a dwarf nova system , having many of the hallmarks of the small class of wz sagittae stars @xcite .",
    "the wz sge stars are characterized by large - amplitude , infrequent outbursts , orbital periods below the period gap ( around 2 hours ) , the presence of superhumps in the light curve , echo outbursts , and a slow decline from maximum light to quiescence . for an overview of the wz sge class , see @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the available photometric and spectroscopic evidence and justify our classification of asas j002511 + 1217.2 as a wz sge star . in section 2 , we describe the photometric observations obtained by aavso observers during the 2004 outburst and discuss the periodic behavior seen . in section 3",
    ", we describe the spectroscopic observations , and the orbital parameters derived from these data . in section 4 , we discuss how this star fits into the wz sge class , and what questions remain about its nature .",
    "the photometric observations of asas j002511 + 1217.2 were first discussed by @xcite , and were obtained during the course of the outburst beginning on 2004 september 10 .",
    "amateur and professional observers from around the world contributed nearly 17000 positive observations of asas j002511 + 1217.2 between 2004 september 15 ( jd 2,453,264 ) and 2004 december 12 ( jd 2,453,352 ) .",
    "in addition , a few hundred visual and ccd `` fainter than '' estimates were obtained through 2005 february 13 ( jd 2,453,414.5 ) .",
    "the majority of observations were made with ccd cameras , both filtered and unfiltered .",
    "figure [ fig01 ] shows the overall light curve of this variable , including all of the positive visual observations and un - calibrated ccd measurements .",
    "of particular interest are the high amplitude of the initial superoutburst ( nearly seven magnitudes ) , the early , abrupt decline in the superoutburst at jd 2,453,277 followed by a single echo outburst at jd 2,453,282 , and the long decay time to quiescence ( 90 days ) .",
    "the high outburst amplitude , long decay time , and echo outbursts are phenomena observed in the wz sge stars , and are our primary reasons for suggesting the wz sge classification .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we discuss the photometric behavior both early and late in the outburst , concentrating on ccd observations made early in the outburst to detect and characterize the superhump period and evolution .",
    "we also discuss the late - outburst photometry , the decline toward quiescence and the probable quiescent level .",
    "the photometric data were obtained by many amateur and professional observers world - wide , and were taken with a variety of equipment including telescopes of both large and small aperture , and with a variety of filters and ccd cameras . however , for period - searching the absolute calibration of the data is not very important .",
    "therefore , prior to time - series analysis , a simple linear fit was subtracted from each observer s data on each night to remove the much larger variation of the underlying outburst along with any zero point differences .",
    "the detrended light curve of the superhumps is shown in figure [ fig02 ] .",
    "as we discuss below , our time - series analysis indicates a superhump period of 0.0569 days ( 81.9 minutes ) .",
    "we do not detect any eclipse signature in the lightcurve , and any signal caused by orbital variation would be difficult to disentangle from the superhump and its evolution . for now , we treat these data as if the signal were purely due to superhumps .      because the periods and light curve profiles of superhumps are known to change throughout the course of outbursts , we investigated whether or not period and superhump profile variations were apparent in the light curve of asas j002511 + 1217.2 .",
    "we performed two separate fourier analyses on the data : one in which we analyzed single days of photometry individually , and one in which we analyzed _ clusters _ of frequencies in the full data set s fourier transform , to search for time - varying periods in the complete set of data .",
    "signals with time - varying periods will generate clusters of frequencies in a fourier power spectrum , rather than a single peak at the main frequency , and analysis of these clusters can provide information on the period evolution with time .",
    "see @xcite for a description of this method .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] shows the period as a function of time for the two analysis methods . because the photometric coverage of individual days was not uniform ,",
    "the error bars of the daily period measurements differ throughout",
    ". however , the period clearly varies at the 3-@xmath1 level .",
    "variations were strongly detected by the first reported time - series observations on jd 2,453,264 , five days after the outburst was first detected .",
    "fourier analysis indicates an average period of 0.0569 days , which remained reasonably constant until jd 2,453,268 ( nine days after the outburst detection ) when the period began to increase by a small but significant amount .",
    "we also used @xmath7 analysis to study the time - varying nature of the superhumps .",
    "the @xmath7 method has been used in the past to study superhump evolution in su uma- and wz sge - type objects , and often shows substantial changes over the course of individual outbursts @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] shows an @xmath7 diagram of the outburst prior to the rapid decline and first echo , using an ephemeris period of 0.0569 days . between jd 2,453,269 and 2,453,272",
    "the phases of the superhumps steadily shifted until they reached a steady offset of approximately 0.03 days , or slightly more than half a period .",
    "this could indicate either a true change in period @xcite , or a change in superhump morphology .",
    "this is a common feature of dwarf novae that exhibit superhumps in outburst , and the @xmath7 diagram is reminiscent of those of wz sge @xcite and al com @xcite .",
    "visual inspection of figure [ fig02 ] shows that the superhumps are clearly changing in shape and amplitude as the outburst progresses .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have any time - series observations for the earliest part of the outburst , and thus can not make any statement on whether so - called `` orbital humps '' having the orbital period were present .",
    "wz sge exhibited clear orbital humps during the first 12 days of the 2001 outburst , as did al comae for the first several days .",
    "both stars were caught very close to the outburst onset , and time - series photometry commenced immediately .",
    "there was a lag of at least five ( and perhaps as much as ten ) days between the onset of the outburst of asas j002511 + 1217.2 and the commencement of time - series photometry .",
    "an answer to this question will have to wait until the detection of the next outburst of this system .",
    "the system began to fade rapidly after jd 2,453,276.5 , and spent nearly four days at @xmath8 prior to the single echo outburst .",
    "the detrended time - series measurements of asas j002511 + 1217.2 over this four day span are shown in figure [ fig05 ] , and a fourier spectrum of these data is shown in figure [ fig06 ] . just prior to the end of the main superoutburst ,",
    "the amplitude of the superhumps dropped significantly , and they do not appear in the light curve during rapid fading .",
    "if superhumps are caused by distortion of the accretion disk @xcite , then the decreasing amplitude may indicate the return of the disk to its normal shape prior to the disk transitioning from its hot , outburst state to the cool state .",
    "a new photometric period of @xmath2 days appears in the data during its time at @xmath8 , and the variations have a much smoother , double - peaked profile that is quantitatively different from that of the superhumps . if this new period were the true orbital period , the resulting period excess @xmath9 would be 0.004 , smaller than that of the shortest - excess wz sge star eg cnc with @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we therefore suspect that this period is not the orbital period , but is another modulation related to superhumps , and that the as - yet undetected orbital period may be closer to the period minimum .",
    "one echo outburst occurred approximately five days after the end of the main outburst , during which the star returned to @xmath11 for less than one day before it rapidly declined to @xmath12 . following this single echo , no other echoes",
    "were observed , and asas j002511 + 1217.2 began its slow decline to quiescence over the following 70 days .",
    "very weak variations are present during the echo ; a period of about 0.0568 days is marginally detected , close to the period of the late superhumps .",
    "@xcite fit maxima to these variations and integrated them into their @xmath7 analysis , indicating that the resulting @xmath7 is similar to that of other wz sge - star outbursts like wz sge itself @xcite .",
    "the timing of the echo outburst is similar to that of eg cnc , which underwent a series of echo outbursts beginning several days after the initial decline of the superoutburst .",
    "however , asas j002511 + 1217.2 exhibited only _",
    "one _ echo .",
    "there are several theories as to the causes of echo outbursts , though all theories predict that the disk must be heated over the thermal instability limit for a new outburst to occur .",
    "the occurrence of only one echo suggests that the accretion disk had either been significantly drained of matter following the initial superoutburst or first echo , or had been cooled sufficiently that the reheating mechanism could only increase the temperature beyond the instability limit one time before the disk began a transition back to its quiescent state .",
    "we discuss these scenarios further in section 4 .",
    "the end of the first echo on jd 2,453,284 left asas j002511 + 1217.2 at @xmath12 , and the system never rebrightened significantly over the following two months .",
    "time - series measurements were obtained through jd 2,453,303 , with visual and ccd monitoring continuing through early 2005 .",
    "the system declined by about one magnitude over the 70 days following the end of the echo outburst , returning to quiescence at @xmath13 .",
    "a few nights of time - series ccd photometry were obtained by several observers following the echo outburst .",
    "we performed a fourier analysis of the data , and found a signal at 0.0570 days , nearly the same as the _ superhump period _ , and not the supposed orbital period as one would expect .",
    "this suggests that the disk remained elliptical throughout outburst _ and _ quiescence .",
    "permanent superhumps are believed to be a feature of high mass - transfer systems , because the disk maintains a large enough radius to be tidally distorted and precessing @xcite .",
    "however , the wz sge stars are believed to have a _ low _ mass - transfer rate .",
    "@xcite recently found an su uma - type system with what appeared to be negative superhumps at quiescence , possibly due to a tilted accretion disk .",
    "photometry of asas j002511 + 1217.2 obtained with a larger telescope during quiescence can determine whether superhumps are actually present , and whether there are orbital variations .",
    "the spectroscopic data were acquired with the apache point observatory ( apo ) 3.5 m telescope on the night of 2004 october 10 from 04:39:21 to 06:39:36 ut ( jd 2,453,288.6940 to 2,453,288.7775 ) .",
    "a total of 15 exposures were taken over this time interval , each with an exposure time of 360 seconds .",
    "this allowed observations at an average separation of seven minutes .",
    "the primary instrument used was the double imaging spectrograph ( dis ) run in high resolution mode with a 1.5  slit .",
    "the dis instrument is designed so that the incoming light is split by a dichroic , and red and blue spectra are taken simultaneously on two separate ccd cameras , allowing for an extended spectral range and improved wavelength resolution .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 3850  to 5550  with 0.6  per pixel resolution on the blue images , and 5550  to 7250  with 0.8  per pixel resolution on the red images .",
    "the spectral coverage provides adequate sampling of several strong emission lines .",
    "the raw spectra were processed using iraf subroutines to produce one - dimensional wavelength and flux calibrated spectra in both wavelength regimes .",
    "the target exposure time of 6 minutes allowed for reasonable signal - to - noise ratios ( s / ns ) such that our orbital period uncertainties were not limited by the raw data resolution , but by limits imposed by the total span of observations and the separation interval of consecutive exposures .",
    "a @xmath14 magnitude of 16.3 was estimated from the flux - calibrated spectra ; this agrees with the @xmath14-band time - series photometry obtained on jd 2,453,285 and 2,453,290 .",
    "coincident @xmath15-band time - series photometry obtained around jd 2,453,288.7 has an average near 15.9 .",
    "figure [ fig07 ] shows sample red and blue spectra for asas j002511 + 1217.2 .",
    "all the spectra show prominent , broad balmer lines in emission with a central absorption that is typical for systems containing an accretion disk .",
    "the average equivalent widths were 66 , 39 , and 24  for h@xmath4 , h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 respectively .",
    "these values , together with the widths of the line ( full - width , zero - intensity measures of 75  and 60  for h@xmath4 and h@xmath16 respectively ) and the depth of the central absorption imply a fairly high inclination .",
    "velocity measurements of the balmer emission lines were made in order to determine the orbital period of the system .",
    "the h@xmath4 , h@xmath16 , and h@xmath17 lines all had sufficient signal to noise to allow for measurement of their central wavelengths .",
    "initially , the iraf centroid fitting technique ` e ' was used in the @xmath18 task to estimate the line wavelengths in each spectrum over the course of the night .",
    "these wavelengths together with observation times were run through the idl routine @xmath19 that performed a least - squares sinusoidal fit to the data , and simultaneously output the calculated values and uncertainties for period ( p ) , semi - amplitude ( k ) , phase offset @xmath20 and the velocity of the system @xmath21 .",
    "however , as one example shows in figure [ fig08 ] , some of the lines had sub - structure that prevented a consistent wavelength estimate .",
    "although the emission lines were strong and statistically distinguishable from the continuum noise , narrow components can distort the centroid calculation .",
    "a second velocity measurement was made of all spectra using a double gaussian routine that is optimized to measure the line wings @xcite .",
    "this method works best for broad lines with high signal to noise ratios .",
    "shafter found that the optimum gaussian separation width for computing the central wavelength corresponds to an effective flux of about @xmath22 or @xmath23 of the line flux .",
    "analyzing the velocities closer to the wings of the emission lines rules out the possibility that variations resulting from a hotspot located in the outer edge of the disk could mislead a centroid finding program , as the wings correspond to the faster rotating inner disk . to allow maximum flexibility for a variety of spectra",
    ", this method iterates through and produces a variety of gaussian separations as a function of velocity .",
    "each one of these gaussian separations is put into the idl routine @xmath24 which generates a radial velocity curve where the errors can be minimized interactively . by looking at a diagnostic plot ( figure [ fig09 ] ) of the sinusoidal fits for each of the radial velocity measurements , the fit with the lowest errors could be selected for each of the emission lines .",
    "the best estimate for the period from this double gaussian method , could then be set as a fixed parameter in our original idl sinusoidal fitting routine @xmath25 and the error estimates could be compared with an unconstrained fit .",
    "additional analysis attempting to search for periodicity in the blue and red continuum fluxes in the spectra showed no repetitive behavior .",
    "the final parameters from both of the analysis routines are presented for comparison in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "since there was large disagreement in the periods for the centroid analysis ( which could be partly due to the differing contributions of the narrow line component in the blue versus the red ) , we fixed the period at the average of the double gaussian method for the 3 lines ( 82 min ) and reran a final solution which is the bottom entry in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "the final fits to the data with this solution are shown in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "analysis of the narrow components of the balmer emission features via the same iraf centroid routine was attempted to estimate the location of a hotspot .",
    "the phase offset between the narrow and broad components allows us to quantitatively estimate where the mass stream impacts the accretion disk .",
    "however , measurement of the narrow component is difficult as it could not be accurately located at all phases .",
    "the result of our measurements of the velocities for the narrow component in h@xmath4 is shown overplotted with the broad component in figure [ fig11 ] .",
    "although an exact origin of the narrow component can not be calculated , the narrow component is most visible around an orbital phase of 0.9 .",
    "this rules out irradiation of the secondary star as an origin for this component , because at an orbital phase of 0.9 the secondary is near inferior conjunction and we are viewing the side of the secondary that is away from the white dwarf .",
    "this , together with the phase offset and large velocity amplitude of the narrow component ( figure [ fig11 ] ) argues for an origin in a hot spot due to the impact of the accretion stream on the outer edge of the disk .",
    "we argue that the observational evidence gathered so far indicates that asas j002511 + 1217.2 is a wz sge star .",
    "the outburst amplitude of seven magnitudes ( based upon the initial asas detection at @xmath26 and the hamburg quasar survey pre - outburst detection at @xmath27 ) is marginally larger than the maximum of about six magnitudes seen in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "this star is also a 2mass point source , and the @xmath28 and @xmath29 colors of @xmath30 and @xmath31 respectively suggest a late - k , early - m companion ( see figure 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "the period as derived from superhumps and late - outburst photometry is short , and similar to other known wz sge systems , although su uma stars can have similarly short periods .",
    "the superhump evolution is nearly identical to that observed in other wz sge stars .",
    "the overall outburst lightcurve is similar to those of wz sge systems , including the presence of an echo outburst , and a very long decay time to true quiescence ( _ at least _ 90 days from peak to @xmath13 ) .",
    "the echo outburst is particularly striking evidence , as echoes have not been detected in su uma stars ; only in wz sge stars .",
    "the single echo detected in asas j002511 + 1217.2 was separated by a few days from the rapid decline of the main outburst , as is seen in the most prominent echo outburster , eg cnc .",
    "however , further information is needed since we lack a clear understanding of the development of the superhumps , and havent determined the orbital period .",
    "the period of @xmath32 days observed during the short quiescent interval between the main outburst and the first echo is accurate , and does not appear to be a sidelobe misidentification .",
    "the 0.0570-day period present after jd 2,453,288 matches the supposed superhump period observed during the main outburst .",
    "it is possible that the early variations observed during the main outburst were _",
    "orbital humps _ , before the disk had begun to precess , but such humps typically appear very early in outburst",
    ". our time - series photometry does not begin until _ at least _ five days after the star reached maximum , and it is possible that the true maximum occurred as much as five days before the asas detection because the last non - detection was made on jd 2,453,254 .",
    "the presence of only one echo outburst may indicate a low mass transfer rate .",
    "echo outbursts may be due to several things , including a temporary increase in mass transfer caused by heating of the secondary @xcite , or temporary reheating episodes of a still - elliptical , post - superoutburst disk while it drains @xcite .",
    "the presence of superhumps during echo outbursts that are in phase with those of the main outburst @xcite suggests that the main outburst ends while the disk is still elliptical .",
    "if echo outbursts are triggered by mass draining from the outer disk , then the single echo implies that this reservoir was sufficiently drained by the original outburst and first echo to preclude any additional echoes .",
    "our photometric and spectroscopic study of asas j002511 + 1217.2 has revealed a system showing all the properties of a low accretion rate dwarf nova . the bulk of the evidence ( large outburst amplitude , an echo outburst , superhumps , long decline to quiescence , and a suspected short orbital period ) justifies a wz sge classification rather than an su uma system . it does not appear that this system has eclipses , although the breadth and deep doubling of the emission lines implies a fairly high inclination .",
    "longer time - resolved spectroscopy can be used to pin down the orbital period to higher precision .",
    "this can then be compared with the superhump period to obtain a period excess and hence a mass ratio and estimate of the mass of the secondary , as has been done for other wz sge systems @xcite .",
    "further time - resolved photometry during quiescence can determine if the continuum is modulated at the orbital period due to structures in the disk .",
    "continued monitoring of this system , both by the amateur community and by automated systems such as asas @xcite can catch future outbursts and determine if the single echo outburst is typical of this system , and related to its particular mass transfer rate .",
    "this system is bright enough at maximum to be well - within the range of both visual and ccd observers .",
