    "elliptical galaxies in clusters are old .",
    "dispersions of colours around colour - magnitude ( _ c - m _ ) relation of cluster ellipticals are small at low and intermediate redshifts ( bower , lucey & ellis 1992b ; ellis 1997 ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that almost all stars in ellipticals formed at a high redshift , at least @xmath3@xmath4 .",
    "colour change of ` red - envelope ' galaxies in high redshift clusters suggests that these galaxies formed at @xmath3 and evolved passively since then ( aragn - salamanca 1993 ) .",
    "a similar implication was given by mg@xmath5 indices of ellipticals in clusters at intermediate redshift ( bender , ziegler & bruzual 1996 ) .",
    "recent analyses of the _ c - m _ relations of cluster e / s0s at high redshift , all of which are morphologically classified by hst imaging , also require that ellipticals should form at @xmath3 ( kodama 1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1997 ) .",
    "an implication derived from these observational evidence is in full agreement with a picture predicted by a galactic wind model for the formation of elliptical galaxies ( larson 1974 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "elliptical galaxies should form by dissipative collapse of proto - galactic massive cloud , during which stars were born intensively and the star formation ceased when the gas in a galaxy was expelled due to the super - novae driven galactic wind .",
    "galaxies then evolved passively without experiencing any significant event of star formation .",
    "nevertheless , there is a growing piece of evidence showing that elliptical galaxies , in particular in the low density environment , might have experienced secondary formation of stars in the recent past ( e.g. , schweizer 1990 ; schweizer & seitzer 1992 ; rose 1994 ; bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ; barger 1996 ) .",
    "schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) analysed colours and line indices of e / s0 galaxies in the field as well as in groups and found that @xmath6 and @xmath7 become systematically bluer and h@xmath1 indices become stronger as the number of fine structure increases , which suggests that the secondary episode of star formation is related to dynamical disturbances of galaxies , probably caused by mergers and/or interactions with other galaxies ( see also schweizer 1990 ) .",
    "hierarchical clustering models of galaxy formation based on the cdm hypothesis ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole 1994 ) suggest that the star formation took place recently in elliptical galaxies due to galaxy merging .",
    "the cdm based models predict significant fraction of star burst at @xmath8 in elliptical galaxies especially in the field .    with a help of population synthesis model by worthey ( 1994 ) , de jong & davies ( 1996 )",
    "have recently analysed the h@xmath1 and [ mgfe ] indices of elliptical galaxies , spectra of which were taken by gonzlez ( 1993 ) .",
    "most of galaxies are the members of small groups .",
    "they estimate the amount of star burst that is required to reproduce the h@xmath1 and disk - to - total light ratio ( d / t ) .",
    "the resulting fraction of young stars is larger than 10  % if they are 2  gyr old .",
    "barger ( 1996 ) demonstrate that at least 30  % of cluster galaxies in ac 103 , ac 114 , and ac 118 ( @xmath9 ) , seem to have undergone a secondary burst of star formation during the last @xmath10 2  gyr prior to the epoch of observation , though many of them are regular e / s0s .",
    "this implies that the frequency of secondary burst is very high even for cluster ellipticals , where the galaxy - galaxy merger is supposed to be less frequent than in the field .",
    "independently , broad band colours can put much stronger constraints on the nature of secondary star burst in cluster e / s0s .",
    "bower ( 1992b ) analysed @xmath0 colour dispersions around the _ c - m _ relations of coma and virgo clusters , and found that the amount of mass involved in the secondary burst should be less than 10  % if the age of burst population is 5  gyr .",
    "if a younger age of 2  gyr is assumed , the burst population should be less than only a few percent .",
    "the problem arising here is an apparent inconsistency between the two types of analyses ; the line indices against the colour dispersion .",
    "the lines always indicate larger fraction of the secondary burst population .",
    "recent studies tend to heavily rely on the line indices data to derive the contribution of the secondary burst population ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; de jong & davies 1996 ) .",
    "however , the burst strength thus derived should also explain the observed @xmath0 , since at least the synthesized broad band colours are much more reliable than the line indices which are usually calculated independently of colours by using empirical polynomial fitting functions ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this paper",
    ", therefore , we analyse @xmath0 and h@xmath1 indices of ellipticals in gonzlez ( 1993 ) sample , and derive new constraints on the amount of young population .    in ",
    "2 we compile the data used in this study . in ",
    "3 we describe the method to compute models for elliptical galaxies with the secondary star burst .",
    "the resulting constraints for the star formation history in ellipticals are given in  4 . in ",
    "5 we discuss possible causes for the discrepancy between @xmath0 and h@xmath1 analysis , and conclude this paper .",
    "we have analysed a whole sample of 41 elliptical galaxies to which gonzlez ( 1993 ) gives measurements of the conspicuous lick line strengths .",
    "h@xmath1 line strengths ( at @xmath11   ) and central velocity dispersions @xmath12 ( within the inner 5 arcsec ) are taken from gonzlez ( 1993 ) and broad band colours are taken from rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "following schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) , we define @xmath13 as @xmath14,\\ ] ] where subscript @xmath15 refers to global colours , subscript @xmath16 indicates colours corrected for the extinction due to interstellar dust in our galaxy as well as for the redshift , and subscript @xmath17 refers to average colours within an effective radius .",
    "internal extinction is neglected because they are not given in rc3 but an argument is given later on the possible influence of the internal extinction .",
    "observational errors are taken into account in @xmath18 , but errors involved in the correction procedure in deriving @xmath13 are not included because they are not given in rc3 . therefore the errors of @xmath13 could be substantially larger than those given in figs .",
    "[ fig : uv],[fig : uv_tb2 ] , [ fig : uv_hbeta_tb2 ] , and [ fig : uv_av_tb2 ] .",
    "this would not affect our arguments significantly , however , since our main concern is to understand why the dispersion in colours is so small along the @xmath13 versus @xmath19 relation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : uv ] ) while some galaxies are showing strong evidence of young stars in the measured h@xmath1 lines .",
    "errors in the velocity dispersion are very small ( @xmath10 1  % ; gonzlez 1993 ) , and thus are ignored .",
    "1.0    the 10 galaxies among gonzlez s sample show strong h@xmath1 absorption , which may be due to contamination of some young stars in these galaxies .",
    "in analogy to h@xmath20 strong galaxies defined by couch & sharples ( 1987 ) , we define h@xmath1 strong galaxies as those having equivalent width ew(h@xmath1 ) larger than 2   . gonzlez ( 1993 )",
    "gives h@xmath1 indices for three different apertures ; nuclear 5 arcsec , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the effective radius of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we adopt the @xmath22 aperture for h@xmath1 indices , since it is the closest to @xmath24 within which the colours in rc3 are defined .",
    "this would minimize the effect of h@xmath1 line strength gradient which is sometimes shown for elliptical galaxies ( gorgas , efstathiou & aragn - salamanca 1990 ; davies , sadler & peletier 1993 ; gonzlez 1993 ) . figure  [ fig : hbeta ] shows the h@xmath1 indice versus central velocity dispersion ( @xmath25 ) for the gonzlez s whole sample .",
    "the filled circles represent the h@xmath1 strong galaxies .",
    "the ngc number is attached to each of them .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a sequence of model ellipticals ( see   3 ) .",
    "note that the h@xmath1 strong galaxies are away from the sequence more than 0.3   .",
    "1.0    figure  [ fig : uv ] shows the @xmath13 versus @xmath25 ( km s@xmath26 ) diagram for 33 ellipticals .",
    "8 galaxies among gonzlez s sample are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] because @xmath13 are not available in rc3 .",
    "the h@xmath1 strong galaxies are indicated by filled circles .",
    "we note that a well defined correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath25 is clearly seen ( the _ c_-@xmath27 relation ) in this diagram .",
    "the solid line gives a regression line for the sampled galaxies .",
    "the regression line to elliptical galaxies in coma and virgo clusters ( bower 1992b ) is also shown by the dot - dashed line . since the @xmath28-band filter used by bower , lucey & ellis ( 1992a ) is slightly different from the standard johnson system , we apply small corrections , although it is negligibly small compared to the errors in colours ( @xmath29 mag ) . in spite of a difference in the aperture size between the two photometries , agreements both in slope and zero - point are remarkable .",
    "the standard deviations are also comparable ; 0.046  mag for bower ( 1992b ) and 0.054  mag for our sample .",
    "true that most of the gonzlez galaxies locate in small groups , yet they have similar _",
    "c_-@xmath27 relation to that of cluster ellipticals .",
    "considering the fact that cluster ellipticals have an almost universal metallicity sequence as a function of galaxy luminosity or size ( kodama et al .",
    "1998 ) , the similarity in the _ c_-@xmath27 relation we see above suggests that gonzlez sample would also share the same metallicity sequence .",
    "this reinforces our coming assumption that the colour of the underlying old population in ellipticals should locate along the _",
    "c_-@xmath27 relation thus defined ( see   3.2 ) .",
    "although larson , tinsley , & caldwell ( 1980 ) claimed that the _ c - m _ relation of field ellipticals are less tight than that of cluster ellipticals , we do not find this in the case for the gonzlez galaxies .",
    "it is clearly needed to settle this problem with new systematic photometry data of nearby field ellipticals .",
    "the other notable thing is that the h@xmath1 strong galaxies are not always bluer in colours compared to the _",
    "c_-@xmath27 relation , although they are expected to be appreciably bluer if suffering from the secondary burst of star formation recently .",
    "the 5 galaxies out of 10 h@xmath1 strong galaxies , ngc 507 , ngc 584 , ngc 1700 , ngc 3377 , and ngc 7454 , locate below ( bluer ) the line of _ c_-@xmath27 relation in fig .  [",
    "fig : uv ] .",
    "these galaxies are likely to have considerable number of young stars .",
    "however , except ngc 3377 , these galaxies are bluer no more than 0.1  mag , which indicates little contamination of young stars to the galactic light .",
    "the h@xmath1 strong galaxies should contain certain amount of young stars and yet some of them do not show any evidence in colours for young stars . in the following  3",
    ", we build a series of models for elliptical galaxies with the young population superposed onto the underlying old populations and examine how much young stars can be in hiding to give compatible h@xmath1 line strengths while keeping the _ c_-@xmath27 relation tight .",
    "we build models for elliptical galaxies , having experienced the secondary burst of star formation , by superposing the young stellar population onto the old underlying populations . for the underlying populations ,",
    "we adopt the metallicity sequence models of elliptical galaxies calculated by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) and kodama ( 1997 ) .",
    "these models are calibrated to reproduce the _ c - m _ relation of elliptical galaxies in coma cluster by changing a galactic wind epoch as a function of initial mass of a galaxy .",
    "this is equivalent to change the mean stellar metallicity of galaxies along the _ c - m _ relation .",
    "the age of the galaxies is assumed to be 12  gyr .",
    "all stars formed very quickly before the wind ( @xmath300.5  gyr ) .",
    "the time scale of star formation is assumed to be 0.1  gyr .",
    "a salpeter - like initial mass function ( imf ) is assumed with a slope @xmath31 ( the salpeter imf corresponds to @xmath32 in our definition ) .",
    "the lower and the upper mass cutoffs @xmath33 and @xmath34 are set to be 0.1 and 60 @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "the mean stellar metallicity @xmath36 decreases from 0.0 to @xmath370.5 for the range of 6 magnitudes covered by the _ c - m _ relation ( @xmath38 to @xmath39  mag ) .",
    "chemical evolution is taken into account under the so - called infall model scheme ( kppen & arimoto 1990 ) .",
    "the models are shown to match very well with the observed _ c - m _ relations of elliptical galaxies in distant clusters ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ; kodama et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion is assigned to each model galaxy with a help of the @xmath13 versus @xmath40 relation defined in  2.3 ( solid line in fig .  [ fig : uv ] ) as :    @xmath41,\\ ] ]    where we use theoretical @xmath0 for @xmath13 .",
    "the lick spectral indices are calculated by using the polynomial analytical fits given by worthey , faber & gonzlez ( 1992 ) .",

    "[ fig : hbeta ] by the solid line .",
    "1.0    we assume that the secondary burst happened instantaneously .",
    "in such a case , the spectrum of the burst population is approximated by the so - called simple stellar population ( ssp ) model ( buzzoni 1989 ) .",
    "thus we ignore the metal enrichment during the secondary burst .",
    "the imf slope of the secondary population is assumed to be @xmath32 ( the salpeter imf ) . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the same as those of the underlying population .",
    "note we adopt different imf slope for the burst popualtion from that of the underlying population , simply because there is no reliable estimate available .",
    "however , our conclusion would not be affected by this choice of imf slope .",
    "if we were to use @xmath31 for the burst population instead , the acceptable burst strength would become even smaller due to more numerous young stars .",
    "therefore , our coming conclusion would be more strengthened .",
    "the evolution of @xmath0 and h@xmath1 index of the ssp models are illustrated in fig .",

    "1996 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "the age of the burst population @xmath45 is varied from 0.1 gyr to 5  gyr as a free parameter .",
    "if the secondary burst is induced by capturing a small gas - rich galaxy , as is most likely , the mean stellar metallicity of the burst population should not exceed the solar metallicity , since typical metallicities of dwarf irregulars are well below the solar value ( skillman , kennicutt & hodge 1989 ) . even if the chemical enhancement during the burst is considered , the average metallicity of the bust population hardly exceeds the solar value unless the imf slope is significantly flatter than the salpeter imf",
    ". therefore we adopt @xmath46 and @xmath47 as the representative metallicities of the secondary burst .",
    "the burst strength ( @xmath48 ) is defined by a _",

    "we assume that the velocity dispersion does not change before and after the burst , since the mass involved in the secondary burst is usually small compared to that of the underlying population .",
    "even if the fraction of the burst is as high as 20  % in mass , the resulting increase of the velocity dispersion is at most @xmath49 if the galaxy is in virial equilibrium before and after the burst .",
    "if the dark matter dominate the galaxy potential , the influence of the burst population to the velocity dispersion should be less significant .    along the _",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbeta_tb2 ] for the case of @xmath562  gyr .",
    "it is clearly seen that the h@xmath1 strong galaxies can only be reproduced by adding more than 1015  % young star burst , which is consistent with de jong & davies ( 1996 ) . however , this number is more than twice as much as that expected from the @xmath0 analysis presented above .",

    "the results are tabulated in the fifth column of table 1 . as a consequence ,",
    "the h@xmath1 indices are always smaller than 2   .",
    "thus the models constrained from the @xmath0 colours fail to reproduce the h@xmath1 strong galaxies ( h@xmath1 @xmath57 2   ) .",
    "since the strong balmer absorption lines are characteristic of a - type stars , the contribution from such stars becomes maximum at around @xmath10 0.20.5  gyr after the onset of burst ( fig .",

    "if the age of secondary burst is as young as 0.51  gyr as suggested from the numerical simulation of shells around dynamically disturbed ellipticals ( hernquist & quinn 1987 ) , the burst strength should be quite small , such as less than 12  % .",
    "conversely , if we assume older burst ages , the limit of @xmath48 becomes larger ( more than 20  % for @xmath515  gyr , for example ) , but @xmath60",

    "thus , the lower limit of @xmath64 is 7.39.1  gyr and that of @xmath65 is 8.410.5  gyr .",
    "these are much older than the age of bulk of ellipticals that worthey , trager & faber ( 1996 ) assigned from the balmer line indices .",
    "these authors find significant number of extremely young elliptical galaxies with age only 23  gyr .",
    "the mean age is also quite young such as 45  gyr , nearly half of what we find .",
    "the discrepancy of the results between the analysis based on the colours and the one based on the line indices can be seen here as well .    in conclusion , apart from ngc 3377 , which could be the only candidate that might actually have high burst strength of upto 1520   % for @xmath55  gyr and could be consistent with its h@xmath1 strength ,",
    "the intensity of the secondary star burst should be less than only a few percent in mass to be compatible with the observed @xmath0 .",
    "it is not strong enough to explain the h@xmath1 strong galaxies , however .",
    "so far we have calibrated the models of the underlying old populations using the linear regression line of the data on the _",
    "c_-@xmath27 diagram , supported by the existence of mass - metallicity relation for elliptical galaxies as we discussed in   2.3 .",
    "however , one could alternatively take the location of the underlying population as the reddest envelope of the sample galaxies , if all galaxies bluer than the red envelope are regarded as being contaminated by young stars .",
    "although we believe this is unlikely as discussed above , we estimate how much the upper limit of @xmath59 could be increased if this effect is the case .",
    "if we take the red envelope at 0.07  mag redder than the regression line , the acceptable burst strength increases to @xmath6610  % .",
    "therefore , even in this case , the maximum burst strength in mass fraction should be less than 10  % at most , within recent 2  gyr .",
    "1.0    furthermore , one may claim that low mass systems have more often disky shapes and can contain more young stellar populations ( e.g. , kormendy and bender 1996 ) , therefore the slope of the _ c_-@xmath27 relation of the underlying old population might possibly be flattened at the faint end than that defined in this paper .",
    "this is equivalent to weaken the metallicity variation as a function of galaxy mass and to introduce some age difference instead .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv_hbeta_tb2 ] where the sample galaxies are plotted in the @xmath0 versus h@xmath1 diagram with the secondary burst models superposed , the four h@xmath1 strong ellipticals with low dynamical masses ( @xmath67 ) could be explained consistently both in @xmath0 and h@xmath1 at the same time with some combination of metallicity and burst strength , if one could neglect the _",
    "c_-@xmath27 relation .",
    "the other h@xmath1 strong ellipticals with larger masses locate out of the model grid , and the @xmath60-h@xmath1 discrepancy is quite evident for these galaxies in anycase . however , if lower mass systems tend to be more contaminated by young stars , the slope of the _ c_-@xmath27 relation and hence the _ c - m _ relation is expected to vary from cluster to cluster , given the colour is very sensitive to a small difference of the amount of young stars .",
    "this trend is far from what we actually observe both locally and at high redshifts ( garilli et al .",
    "1996 , stanford et al .",
    "1997 , kodama et al .",
    "1998 , lpez - cruz 1997 ) .",
    "it has been shown that most of clusters have a common slope when compared to coma or virgo cluster . even if it were the case that low mass galaxies would contain more young stars , the @xmath60-h@xmath1 discrepancy could not be compensated . in order to be consistent with strong h@xmath1 indices of these low mass galaxies ,",
    "the secondary star burst of 1520  % in mass is required with @xmath68  gyr .",
    "if they were to have such strong star burst ( 15  % ) , the colour of the underlying population should be @xmath69 , just comparable to the typical colour of the rest of ellipticals , and we would no longer see the _",

    "the 15  % burst with @xmath68  gyr gives luminosity weighted ages of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which are 67  gyr younger than the bulk of more massive ellipticals ( which corresponds to about 4 magnitude brighter using the fabor - jackson law ) .",
    "as expected , the 67  gyr difference in 4 magnitude range of _ c - m _ relation is almost comparable to a pure age sequence discussed in kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) and kodama et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which is absolutely rejected by the evolution of _ c - m _ slope as a function of redshift . therefore ,",
    "the observed _ c - m _ relation of clusters does not support the idea xthat the low mass h@xmath1 strong ellipticals have experienced much stronger secondary burst than our estimate .",
    "after all , the @xmath60-h@xmath1 discrepancy does remain ; i.e. , the integrated @xmath0 colour of gonzalez s sample of ellipticals permit only 10% of the secondary stellar population at most , while the strong h@xmath1 indices suggest much larger burst strengths .",
    "we here consider possible reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "\\(1 ) _ model uncertainty_. one possible reason is that the h@xmath1 synthesis model based on the empirical calibration of worthey ( 1992 ) may be still premature partly because the scatter around the polynomial fitting lines might be too large and/or because the zero - point of the model might be uncertain .",
    "@xmath0 could have uncertainties as well ( charlot , worthey & bressan 1996 ) , but they are expected to be small at ages 12  gyr or younger , since at such young ages , @xmath0 colour is driven primarily by the evolution of the main sequence turn - off stars , and is relatively simple to model .",
    "( 2 ) _ emission correction_. gonzlez ( 1993 ) corrected the contamination of h@xmath1 emission for the equivalent width of h@xmath1 absorption by using the intensity of [ oii ] emission .",
    "although this empirical procedure is reasonable , it causes uncertainty in the h@xmath1 indices . if the correction tends to be overestimated , the real h@xmath1 absorption could be much lower and consistent with @xmath0 analysis .",
    "\\(3 ) _ aperture effect_. h@xmath1 indices are defined in the @xmath72 aperture , while the colours are defined in the @xmath23 aperture .",
    "if all stars of the secondary population are formed locally within @xmath72 , the allowed burst strength could be 1.56 times larger within @xmath72 following de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath73-law . this could rise the model h@xmath1 indices by about 0.10.15    , and it could marginally make up the discrepancy . according to davies , sadler & peletier ( 1993 ) , however , h@xmath1 absorption is constant or increasing with a radius in almost all cases of elliptical galaxies in their sample . though this could be partly due to the dilution of the h@xmath1 absorption feature by emission in the centers of galaxies ( davies et al .",
    "1993 ) , h@xmath1 would be hardly changed between @xmath72 and @xmath23 aperture .",
    "\\(4 ) _ internal dust extinction_. the internal dust extinction is expected to have more effect on @xmath0 colour than on h@xmath1 indices .",

    "the internal extinction is taken into account to the model spectra in a simple way .",
    "the extinction law is taken from mathis ( 1990 ) .",
    "we assumed that the dust distribution in the galaxies is localized only in the region where the secondary burst occurred .",
    "hence we applied the extinction correction only for the burst population , and not for the old underlying population . in figures  [ fig : uv_av_tb2 ] and [ fig : hbeta_av_tb2 ] , the effect of extinction is shown for @xmath0 and h@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "@xmath74 is changed as 0.0 , 0.5 , and 1.0 mag . the model with @xmath59=20  % and @xmath74=0.5  mag , for example",
    ", could possibly reproduce some of the h@xmath1 strong galaxies both in @xmath0 and h@xmath1 .",
    "the effect of internal extinction certainly allows a higher upper limit to the burst strength .",
    "a study of infrared colours of gonzlez sample would help since the sed at longer wavelengths is less vulnerable to the dust extinction .",
    "1.0    .",
    "1.0    in summary , although considerable dust extinction for burst population could solve the discrepancy between @xmath0 and h@xmath1 analyses , we rely on @xmath0 at the moment , considering that the h@xmath1 might have great uncertainties both in models and in observational data . in this case",
    ", we can put strong constraint on the secondary episode of star formation in ellipticals : elliptical galaxies , regardless of their environments , experience little secondary star formation in the recent past .",
    "for example , the mass fraction of the young burst population should be quite small , typically less than 47  % , and 10  % at most within recent 2  gyr , this suggests that the dynamical disturbance found in some ellipticals is more likely to be caused by a capture of dwarf galaxy with a mass of order @xmath75@xmath76 , rather than a merging of two galaxies of comparable size .",
    "if ellipticals formed by the recent mergings of comparable galaxies , as hierarchical clustering models of the universe suggest , it should have proceeded without any significant star formation .",
    "however , it is yet to be studied in detail how such process can create the observed _ c - m _ relation of ellipticals .",

    "<S> we put upper limits of secondary burst of star formation in elliptical galaxies of the gonzalez s ( 1993 ) sample , most of which locates in small groups , based on the colour dispersion around the @xmath0 versus central velocity dispersion relation , and the equivalent width of h@xmath1 absorption . </S>",
    "<S> there are significant number of h@xmath1 strong galaxies which have ew(h@xmath1)@xmath2   , however they do not always have bluer colours in @xmath0 . to be consistent with small colour dispersion of @xmath0 , the mass fraction of secondary burst to the total mass should be less than only 10  % at the maximum within recent 2  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests that even if recent galaxy merging produce some ellipticals , it should not have been accompanied by an intensive star burst , and hence it could not involve large gas - rich systems . </S>",
    "<S> a capture of dwarf galaxy is more likely to explain dynamical disturbances observed in some elliptical galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis based on the @xmath0 is not compatible with the one based on the line indices , which requires that more than 10  % of mass is present in a 2  gyr old star burst to cover the full range of the observed h@xmath1 ( de jong & davies 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the discrepancy might be partly explained by the internal extinction localized at the region where young stars form . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering that the h@xmath1 index might have great uncertainties both in models and in observational data , we basically rely on @xmath0 analysis .    </S>",
