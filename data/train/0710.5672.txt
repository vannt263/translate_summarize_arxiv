    "the experimental and computational advances in our capacity of producing and trapping samples of cold ( below 1 k ) or ultracold ( below 1 mk ) molecules in the gas phase have made tremendous progress in recent years and have dramatically enhanced our detailed understanding of the processes at hand within their nanoscopic evaluation  @xcite .",
    "the ensuing cold and ultracold molecular species have many possible applications such as allowing for the accurate measurement of fundamental physical properties  @xcite , the possible evaluations of small energy differences between enantiomers  @xcite and the observation of temporal changes of the fine - structure constant  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dipolar species have been suggested as qubits in quantum computers  @xcite and polar gases in general , neutral and ionic , are expected to exhibit even more marked novel features due to their environment  @xcite .",
    "in addition , translationally cold molecular ions , and polar ions at that , can also become embedded inside coulomb crystals  @xcite and provide ideal targets for a large variety of investigations like high precision spectroscopic measurements and state selected partners in ionic reactions  @xcite .",
    "earlier suggestions in this experimental area include the analyses of the ca@xmath0/na system by the storrs group  @xcite , while the choice of a molecular partner as we shall be examining here is currently being considered by various experimental groups as a possible option  @xcite .",
    "the insertion of a molecular ion partner within a coulomb crystal  @xcite , i.e. their phase transition to an ordered state at ultralow temperatures in the range of a few millikelvins , is one of the intriguing steps for the subsequent handling of such ions within a broad variety of molecular processes .",
    "the present study therefore intends to provide , within a fully ab initio formulation of the problem , an accurate description of the interaction forces which drive some of the possible collisional processes at such low temperatures .",
    "in particular , we wish to present the energy details and the spatial features of the various potential energy surfaces ( pes ) which become relevant in the direct process that involves mgh@xmath0(x@xmath1 ) in collision with rb(@xmath2s ) , both partners being current candidates in cold trap experiments  @xcite . because of",
    "the differences between the ionization potentials of the two partners we shall also show that the mgh(x@xmath3 ) molecule interacting with rb@xmath0(@xmath4s ) is indeed an important outgoing channel , which provides an interesting _ reactive _ outcome of the process and which remains open even at ultralow energies .",
    "the section  [ sec : compdet ] therefore discusses our computational details while section  [ sec : result ] presents our results and analyses the novel features of our final pes s .",
    "conclusions are given by the last section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in order to become familiar with the terms and the physical features of the chosen partners in the iontrap , it is useful to remind ourselves of the way in which their electronic features are put together from an ab initio viewpoint . a direct comparison between the ionization potentials ( ip ) of the mgh(x@xmath3 ) and rb(@xmath2s )",
    "reveals that the ground state of the complex molecular ion rbmgh@xmath0 has its lowest energy correlation with the mgh(x@xmath3 ) + rb@xmath0(@xmath4s ) species .",
    "consequently , the electronic state of the ion complex that correlates with mgh@xmath0(x@xmath1 ) + rb(@xmath2s ) , i.e. with fragments which do not undergo charge - exchange , is an excited state from the rbmgh@xmath0 electronic manifold .",
    "if we start our analysis with the simpler case of a collinear geometry , an appropriate generalization of the wigner - witmer correlation rules for diatomic molecules ( see for example pagg .",
    "281 - 284 of  @xcite ) allows us to derive the electronic state manifold of the complex using only the knowledge of the spatial and spin symmetry properties of the electronic states of the combining fragments .",
    "it is worth noting here that the use of the collinear geometry does not limit the generality of our results : it is always possible to univocally resolve the electronic states symmetry species for a particular spatial configuration of a molecule into those of a molecular geometry of lower symmetry by means of group theory .",
    "furthermore , if we combine that qualitative information with the available spectroscopic data for the mgh and mgh@xmath0 , and the ip of rb and mgh , we would obtain the relative energies for the complex electronic states . in this particular case",
    ", we have taken as origin of the energy axis the mgh(x@xmath3 ) + rb@xmath0(@xmath4s ) energy at infinite separation distance .",
    "the relative energy of the mgh@xmath0(x@xmath1 ) + rb(@xmath2s ) asymptote , which is the lowest energy pathway to dissociate into the mgh@xmath0 molecular ion and a neutral rb atom , with respect to the origin of the energy axis is simply the electronic energy difference between the mgh(x@xmath3 ) and the rb(@xmath5 ) ips ( about 2.69 ev ) .",
    "the asymptotic relative energy of any electronic state of the triatomic complex which correlates with an excited electronic state of one , or both of the fragments , is simply obtained by adding the electronic excitation energy to the energy of the appropriate asymptote .",
    "for example , the mgh@xmath0(x@xmath1 )",
    "+ rb(@xmath2p ) energy equals the energy of the mgh@xmath0(x@xmath1 ) + rb(@xmath2s ) plus the rb electronic @xmath2s-@xmath2p transition energy . in this way it is possible to determine the relative energy ordering of the triatomic complex electronic states , at least for an infinite separation between the fragments .",
    "in fact , it should be clear that this approach while giving an exact idea of the possible electronic states , says nothing about their stability and even less about which nuclear conformation is the most stable .",
    "nevertheless , this qualitative information provides valuable help in the choice of the more suitable _ ab initio _ method which should be used in the actual electronic structure calculation .",
    "our figure  [ fig : rbmgh_levels ] summarizes the results obtained from this type of analysis . at the very right side of the figure  [ fig : rbmgh_levels ] we report the possible dissociation channels in the molecular ion mgh@xmath0 and neutral rb for the energy range we have considered relevant for our purposes in this study , while in the center the possible dissociation pathways into neutral mgh and rb@xmath0 are represented . finally , proceeding from the right to the left of figure  [ fig : rbmgh_levels ] the wigner - witmer correlation rules bring the fragments electronic states into the complex ones .",
    "a perusal of figure [ fig : rbmgh_levels ] suggests that a reasonable description of the rbmgh@xmath0 manifold of states could be obtained as a summation of three subsets of electronic states well separated in energy : in the first subset we put the system ground state , in the second one the a@xmath6 and the b@xmath3 states , while the third one collects a number of very high energy electronic states which will eventually correlate with the rubidium excited states and the mgh(b@xmath3 ) state .",
    "it is also worth noting here that all the electronic states employed in the present scheme have the same spin symmetry : they are all doublets . with that information in mind , it is clear that an _ ab initio _ description of the rbmgh@xmath0 electronic structure should be able to treat at least the ground state and the first two excited states in a balanced manner .",
    "in other words , in a case like the present one the use of a multireference ( mr ) electronic wavefunction is mandatory . we have therefore designed a mr wave function within the state averaged complete active space ( sa - cas ) approach : thus , the problem of the choice of a set of n - electron wave functions ( slater determinants or configuration state functions ) is recast into a partition of the molecular orbital space in    * active orbitals , which can have different occupation numbers ( 0,1,2 ) and * inactive orbitals , which are doubly occupied in all the configurations .",
    "the electrons which populate the active orbitals are then called the active electrons .",
    "it is worth noting that , in our calculation the active electrons correspond exactly to the ones commonly defined in chemistry as the valence electrons .",
    "in other words , we choose those molecular orbitals that are supposed to generate within the cas procedure all the n - electron configurations which are important for the description of the electronic states we are interested in .     interacting with a rubidium atom .",
    "see text for details.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    a prior knowledge of the electronic structure of the isolated fragments is therefore helpful in guiding the choice of the active orbital space within the complex : in figure [ fig : mgh_uamo ] a united - atom correlation diagram allows us to determine the symmetry and gives us an idea of the relative energies of the valence molecular orbitals of mgh and mgh@xmath0 by considering the corresponding structures of al and al@xmath0 .",
    "following the aufbau principle , we therefore see that the first two low - lying electronic states , x@xmath3 and a@xmath7 , could be described by single electronic configurations : @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the case of the next higher energy state b@xmath3 is not so straightforward because more than one configuration could be important to describe it : @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc . in the case of the mgh@xmath0(x@xmath12 )",
    "state the single configuration @xmath13 could be the one which manages to account for the main features of that electronic state .",
    "we used that qualitative argument for the choice of a suitable orbitals active space for the calculation of the x@xmath3 , a@xmath6 and b@xmath3 mgh electronic states : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and a @xmath19 anti - bond molecular orbital which has to be included in order to correctly describe the bond dissociation .",
    "this active space produces the cas(3,6 ) ( 3 active electrons in 6 active orbitals ) multireference wavefunction that we used as reference in the multi reference configuration interaction with single and double excitations ( mrci - sd ) calculation of the mgh potential energy curves ( pecs ) reported in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mgh_pes ] .",
    "a completely analogous orbital active space was used to calculate the pecs of mgh@xmath0 low lying electronic states ( reported in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : mgh_pes ] ) , here the only difference is the number of active electrons : there are two of them .",
    "it is interesting to note that the value of the coefficients of the configurations interaction ( ci ) expansion actually reflects the simple qualitative argument based on the aufbau principle and the molecular orbital scheme obtained from the united atom correlation diagram .",
    "in fact , as we can see from table  [ tab : cicoeff ] , the coefficient of the @xmath8 configuration is about 0.95 for the x@xmath3 state , while the a@xmath6 is chiefly described by the @xmath9 configuration ( ci coefficients of 0.96 ) . as expected , in the case of the b@xmath3 state more than one electronic configuration is important : the ci coefficients of the @xmath10 and @xmath20 configurations have comparable values : 0.77 and 0.55 respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the configurations in which the @xmath19 is occupied essentially do nt contribute to the ci expansion , at least at the interatomic distances around the equilibrium value .",

    "the equilibrium distance of the mgh@xmath0(x@xmath1 ) electronic states was extrapolated from the ground state pec reported in the lower panel of figure  [ fig : mgh_pes ] .",
    "the electronic structure calculations have been carried out on a discrete grid defined by varying the jacobi coordinates r and @xmath25 .",
    "the r coordinate was allowed to vary between 3.00 and 16.00  .",

    "the total number of grid points and , eventually , the number of computed ab initio energies was 450 .",
    "the cas(3,6 ) wavefunction outlined in the previous section was used , for each grid point , in a state - averaged mcscf ( sa - mcscf ) calculation of the lowest 4 doublet states of the rbmgh@xmath0 ( the three @xmath34 and the one @xmath35 ) .",
    "however , because the calculations were carried out in @xmath36 symmetry , the actual number of averaged states is indeed 5 ( four @xmath37 and one @xmath38 ) because the @xmath35 state splits into two components ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) which are fully degenerate only at collinear geometries .",
    "the sa - mcscf therefore generates a common set of orbitals for the 5 states which in turn we have used for the subsequent mrci - sd calculations which we expect to correctly account for electron correlation effects : all the electrons , except the mg ( 1s@xmath2 ) , were treated as correlated in the present calculations .",
    "it is worth noting that the highest @xmath3 state was included only to ensure correct convergence of the sa - mcscf wavefunction at all the considered geometries and does nt really have a simple physical meaning : from figure [ fig : rbmgh_levels ] one can see that the actual electronic states above the b@xmath3 are those which correlate with mgh@xmath0(x@xmath1)+rb(@xmath2p ) , i.e. with our present asymptotic state .",

    "see main text for discussion . ]",
    "the results reported by figure  [ fig : rbmgh_pes_cut0 ] further underline the characteristic behavior of the relevant surfaces : the lowest curve for the rb@xmath0 approach on the h atom of the neutral molecular partner clearly shows an attractive well of about @xmath47 , placed well below the incoming channel associated with the charge exchange process ( the b@xmath3 state ) and also below the more stable mgh@xmath48-rb@xmath0 complex of @xmath49 symmetry . in other words , the marked difference in energy between the ionization potential ( see table  [ tab : ip ] and [ tab : rbext ] ) generates the dramatic energy gain that occurs when the interaction is included and which produces the neutral molecule in either an excited or its ground electronic state .",
    "the configurations which describe the approach at the mg side are reported in figure  [ fig : rbmgh_pes_cut180 ] .    , but this time for the rb approach on the mg - side of the molecule ( @xmath50 ) . ]",
    "the basic process remains the same in terms of providing the mgh(x@xmath3 ) as the lower energy molecular partner in the complex , while we see that , for the linear geometries , the possible splitting of the @xmath35 state associated with the nearest charge - exchange channel into its two components ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) strengthens the nonadiabatic coupling with the incoming channel since the latter also shows an @xmath37 symmetry component at those geometries . in other words ,",
    "the formation of mgh@xmath0-rb complex at large distances ( around 6.0 ) is very strongly coupled with the quasi - degenerate charge - exchange process into mgh(a@xmath6)+rb@xmath0(@xmath4s ) , which can in turn radiatively decay into the @xmath37 complex with mgh(x@xmath3 ) as a final partner molecule .",
    "thus , while the @xmath26 orientation indicates a more strongly bound ( mgh@xmath48-rb@xmath0 ) complex which could then radiatively decay to its stable ground state but which had to be reached by a nonadiabatic coupling with a sizable energy gap ( see figure  [ fig : rbmgh_pes_cut0 ] ) , the approach on the other side of the molecule ( figure  [ fig : rbmgh_pes_cut180 ] ) suggests a much smaller energy gap for the nonadiabatic event and the more likely radiative emission from a quasi - bound ( mgh@xmath48-rb@xmath0 ) complex .",

    "interaction and therefore one of its components ( the @xmath37 state ) corresponds to a strongly bound ( mgh@xmath48+rb@xmath0 ) charge exchange complex close in energy to the incoming channel .",
    "the latter , bound intermediate complex can now decay to a nearby lower state and form the most stable charge - exchange arrangement . here again , therefore we see that the analysis of the slopes and feature of the pes already indicates ( at least preliminarily ) that the formation of ultracold mgh could occur via charge - exchange complex into an intermediate , bound complex where the molecular partner is in its excited electronic state , the mgh(a@xmath6)(@xmath37 ) state , from which it can further decay by radiative transitions . from the above discussion , therefore , it is clear that the strength of the relative interactions , and the possible existence of complex bound states within any of the relevant pess for the title system , are crucial elements for selecting possible pathways to the decay , or excluding it , for the initial system containing the molecular cation .",
    "we shall therefore present below the overall fitting of all the relevant interactions which we have discussed above along specific angular cuts and describe their overall feasibility for collisionally coupling radiative states into the final charge - exchange products .",
    "the calculation of the potential energy surfaces have been carried out , as mentioned before , by considering the initial molecular ion at its equilibrium geometry so that only a 2-dimensional mapping of the pes s was generated using the previously discussed ab initio procedure .",

    "both components indicate very weak interaction on the mg - side approach of the impinging atom .",
    "the overall anisotropy , however , changes very markedly as we look at the entrance channel side of the potential energy surface , i.e. at the electronic state of the complex which describes the @xmath3 state whereby the asymptotic partners are given by the mgh@xmath0 molecular ion in the x@xmath1 state and the neutral rb(@xmath2s ) atomic partner .",
    "the change in anisotropy is shown pictorially by the data presented in figure  [ fig : rbmgh_pes_e3 ] , where the spherical dipole polarizability of the atomic partner drives the asymptotic behavior of the whole pes .",
    "the anisotropy of the surface presented in figure  [ fig : rbmgh_pes_e3 ] is indeed showing a smaller attractive well located further out from the molecular center - of - mass and a more uniformly attractive region over the whole angular range .",
    "the above findings therefore suggest a possible dynamical scheme that could be active during the initial interaction between the coulomb crystal arrangement of the molecular ions and the ultracold rb gas interacting with them . in other words ,",
    "the uniformly attractive features of the entrance channel pes indicate long - range attraction between partners which is largely independent of their relative orientational approach and which could thus drive the system into its geometries of stronger interactions .",
    "symmetry ( linear nuclear configuration term symbol : b@xmath3 ) ]    a possible , pictorial path of the process is outlined over the data of figure  [ fig : rbmgh_pes_cut90 ] , where we show superimposed over the potential curves : the entrance channel access ( dashed arrow on the upper right ) to the region of nonadiabatic coupling between the @xmath3 electronic state and the upper charge - exchange channel which produces mgh@xmath48+rb@xmath0 .",
    "the likely dominance of collinear orientations in that channel , and the dramatic increase of the attractive well depth in both @xmath35 components , could drive the system to reach one of the many bound states supported by the @xmath37 components of the @xmath6 electronic configuration , as represented by the thick circular area .",
    "those states could then undergo radiative stabilization into the vibrationally bound complexes of the electronic ground state ( this process is represented by the dotted downward arrow ) , thereby forming the neutral molecule : one can argue that the latter can then be replaced by the cold atomic ions within the coulomb crystal environment . to confirm the above mechanism obviously requires a more detailed analysis of its main ingredients , i.e. of the bound states supported by the [ mghrb]@xmath0 complex in both the relevant electronic states after charge - exchange transitions , the spatial features and the changing strength of the corresponding transition moments , together with the actual calculation of the relevant franck - condon integrals .",
    "all of the above shall be the subject of an additional study , currently under way in our laboratory , while the present work chiefly intends to extract first and discuss the specific properties of accurate ab initio potential energy surfaces which could be employed to drive the ultracold dynamics .",
    "the general characteristics of such interactions , to our knowledge , have never been obtained before .",
    "in this work we have computed from ab initio methods a set of potential energy curves which are expected to be involved in the low - energy interaction of a molecular polar cation , the mgh@xmath0(@xmath1 ) , and the neutral rb(@xmath2s ) atomic partner .",
    "the experimental setup which is considered relevant for the present study is the one provided , at ultralow temperatures , by a coulomb crystal arrangement of molecular ions interacting , and sympathetically cooled , by rb atoms in a cold trap environment  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the accurate calculations which have been carried out here has provided the analytic fitting of 2d grids of raw ab initio points representing the relative strength and the orientational anisotropy of the overall interactions between the four possible asymptotic channel partners : mgh@xmath0 and rb and the three low - lying electronic states of mgh in interaction with rb@xmath0 .",
    "the results indicate the existence of marked energy gain on charge exchange , as obviously expected from the very beginning , but also allow us to uncover the marked orientational effects of the dynamical coupling between partners along the entrance channels and the expectedly strong nonadiabatic coupling which would allow for transitions into intermediate charge - exchange states that include mgh@xmath48 as a partner within the complex .",
    "the present calculations also indicate the possible radiative decay within the trap onto the ground state complex whereby the molecular ion within the coulomb crystal can be replaced by cold atomic ions : the latter partners are , in fact , formed within a fairly attractive potential supporting a large number of bound states that could then break up independently of their initial geometry of formation into the intermediate state . in conclusion , the present study constitutes the necessary , preliminary stage for any dynamical analysis of the collisional processes occurring in the cold environment of a coulomb crystal arrangement : it provides detailed information , which to our knowledge has not been available before , on the spatial extension and orientational features of four of the relevant interaction potentials which can be involved in understanding the nanoscopic dynamics of trap collisions with ultracold ions .",
    "the outcomes of the calculations locate spatial regions where nonadiabatic couplings are more likely to play an important role , suggest possible intermediate complex formations during charge - exchange processes and indicate a possible radiative pathway to ionic replacement within the coulomb crystal environment .",
    "although no experiments as yet exist on the present complex , the information which has been gathered by the present calculations should be a useful starting point for deciding on the likelihood of this molecular ion to be employed for sympathetic cooling with rb cold atomic condensates .",
    "the financial support of the university of rome research committee , of the miur national research project prin 2006 and the computational aid from the caspur consortium are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "we also thank professor s. schiller for suggesting this problem to us ."
