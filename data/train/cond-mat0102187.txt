    "there is currently considerable experimental activity in the area of harmonically confined fermion vapors @xcite .",
    "this has been the motivation for the present letter , in which equations are set up involving the particle density @xmath0 and the kinetic energy density @xmath1 .",
    "we have written both quantities solely as functions of the radial distance @xmath2 , as we shall be dealing with an arbitrary number , say @xmath3 closed shells in an isotropic external potential .",
    "two equations form the basis for what constitutes a density functional theory of independent harmonically confined fermions in three dimensions .",
    "the first is a form of differential virial equation , specific to an isotropic oscillator potential @xmath4 where @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the force constant and @xmath7 the fermion mass .",
    "the second equation relates the turning points of the particle density @xmath0 and kinetic energy density @xmath1 , which we define from the wave function form @xmath8 two other forms of the kinetic energy density will be used below , the first from the gradient of the wave function @xmath9 and the other derived as the average of @xmath1 and @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    "as to the differential virial equation mentioned above , the early work of march and young @xcite , which however was restricted to one - dimensional motion along the @xmath12 axis , say , gave by expansion of the equation of motion of the dirac density matrix around its diagonal : @xmath13 this was termed a differential virial equation since , by multiplying by @xmath12 and integrating over all @xmath12 the usual integral virial theorem was recovered .",
    "we note from the definitions  ( [ ti])-([tibar ] ) above , with the consequence that @xmath14 that eq .",
    "( [ vir1d ] ) can be rewritten @xmath15    while , for one dimension eq .",
    "( [ virmod1d ] ) is valid for a general confining potential @xmath16 , its generalization of present interest refers to a three - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator with closed - shells occupancy .",
    "it is not our purpose in this letter to attempt any general proof , but we shall mention later a number of convincing confirmations of our result . this is @xmath17 but with @xmath18 now restricted to the harmonic form  ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "the factor 3/2 , by comparison with eq .",
    "( [ virmod1d ] ) , is readily understood as due to dimensionality , as is confirmed by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ vir3d ] ) throughout by @xmath2 to form the virial of the force @xmath19 .",
    "a volume integration , followed by integration by parts on the lhs of the resulting equation yields @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total kinetic energy .",
    "it is a very simple matter to verify eq .",
    "( [ vir3d ] ) directly for the lowest shell only occupied , when @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the harmonic oscillator length and @xmath25 a normalization constant . more generally , numerical tests of eq .",
    "( [ vir3d ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for three values of the number of filled shells . in these calculations",
    "we have used the explicit expressions for the particle and kinetic energy densities reported by brack and van zyl @xcite in terms of laguerre polynomials .    as a last remark we note that , although the focus of the present work is on spherical harmonic confinement , any additional term that may enter the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ vir3d ] ) for more general central @xmath18 potentials does not contribute to the integral virial . indeed",
    "( [ virint ] ) is the correct form of the virial theorem for such confinements .",
    "having given these arguments for the form  ( [ vir3d ] ) of the differential virial equation for spherical harmonic confinement , we pass to the second central result of the present study , namely a relation between the turning points of kinetic energy and particle densities . again",
    ", we can make a useful analogy with the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator . with @xmath26",
    "singly occupied shells we can write , following lawes and march @xcite : @xmath27 the single lowest occupancy corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "we now assert that , for the three - dimensional oscillator potential energy  ( [ potential ] ) the appropriate generalization of eq .",
    "( [ turning1d ] ) reads @xmath29 again , no general proof will be attempted .",
    "but for the lowest shell @xmath30 only occupied , we can again use the explicit gaussian wave function @xmath31 given above to calculate @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) and @xmath32 is also readily obtained .",
    "equation  ( [ turning ] ) is confirmed for @xmath30 after a short calculation . more generally , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] reports numerical tests of eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) for three values of the number of filled shells .",
    "again the specific expressions of brack and van zyl @xcite for @xmath1 and @xmath0 have been used .",
    "further confirmation , now in integral form but for general @xmath33 , comes by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) throughout by @xmath34 and doing a volume integration .",
    "integration by parts readily yields , invoking the equipartition theorem for the harmonic oscillator , @xmath35 but the integral on the rhs is related to the total number @xmath26 of fermions occupying @xmath3 closed shells , the simple result @xmath36 following as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) .",
    "this is readily confirmed by calculating the eigenvalue sum @xmath37 from the oscillator levels plus the known degeneracies .",
    "again , for @xmath28 or equivalently @xmath30 , @xmath38 follows immediately from the virial result @xmath39 since @xmath40 for the lowest shell .    before considering the consequences of eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) , when combined with the differential virial theorem , we want to stress that , for @xmath41 , the pauli exclusion principle plays a role in determining both particle and kinetic energy densities . therefore , as a further confirmation of eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) we have used explicit harmonic oscillator wave functions ( see _ e.g. _ morse and feshbach @xcite ) to construct the dirac density matrix @xmath42 for two shells occupied , _",
    "i.e. _ for @xmath43 .",
    "since the degeneracy of the levels for a given total quantum number @xmath44 is @xmath45 , one is then dealing for singly occupied levels with 4 particles , and the dirac matrix is readily constructed as @xmath46 \\exp[-(r^2+{r'}^2)/2a_{ho}^2]\\;.\\ ] ] forming the kinetic energy density from @xmath47 and using the explicit form of @xmath48 following from differentiating with respect to @xmath2 the diagonal density @xmath49 , once again confirms the correctness of eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) for @xmath50 .",
    "given therefore eqs .",
    "( [ vir3d ] ) and ( [ turning ] ) as the two pillars of the present study we go on to construct the density functional theory of this problem of three - dimensional harmonic confinement .",
    "first of all , let us use eqs .",
    "( [ tibar ] ) and  ( [ tigivsti ] ) to remove @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ vir3d ] ) in favour of @xmath1 and @xmath52 . then invoking eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) the derivative @xmath53 can be eliminated , the result being a differential equation for the particle density @xmath0 .",
    "this reads @xmath54 + [ ( m+2)\\hbar \\omega -v(r)]\\rho'(r ) + \\frac{3}{2}\\frac{\\partial v(r)}{\\partial r } \\rho(r)=0\\ ; , \\label{eqdiff}\\ ] ] which we must again emphasize is valid for the three - dimensional potential energy  ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eqdiff ] ) is evidently a third - order , linear , homogeneous equation for the particle density @xmath0 of @xmath3 closed shells . since the pioneering work of von weizscker @xcite",
    ", it has been clear that a major objective of density functional theory is to construct directly the fermion particle density from a given one - body potential .",
    "equation  ( [ eqdiff ] ) achieves that aim quite explicitly for closed shells in the harmonic potential  ( [ potential ] ) .",
    "it is the three - dimensional generalization of the early result of lawes and march @xcite for one - dimensional harmonic confinement .",
    "but there is a further consequence of the two basic equations  ( [ vir3d ] ) and ( [ turning ] ) . for one can alternatively eliminate the potential , in order to directly relate kinetic energy and particle densities .",
    "one finds almost immediately @xmath55\\;.\\ ] ] as emphasized earlier , @xmath51 and @xmath1 differ only by a constant times the laplacian of the particle density .",
    "the resulting relation can be integrated , using an appropriate integrating factor , to give @xmath1 in terms of integrals of @xmath0 and its low - order derivatives .",
    "explicitly we find @xmath56=\\frac{\\hbar^2}{12 m } \\frac{1}{\\rho^{5/3}(r)}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } \\nabla^2 \\rho(r)\\;. \\label{leili}\\ ] ] one can reduce the order of the differential equation  ( [ leili ] ) by explicit integration and by using the `` boundary condition '' @xmath57_{r=0}=(m+2)\\hbar   \\omega$ ] from eq .",
    "( [ turning ] ) to obtain @xmath58 a second integration leads to the final result @xmath59 ^ 2}{\\rho^{8/3}(s ) } \\left[\\frac{1}{2s}+\\frac{\\rho'(s)}{3\\rho(s)}\\right]\\right\\}\\rho^{5/3}(r )     \\label{func}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 ^ 2/\\rho(r)$ ] is the von weizscker `` surface '' contribution to the kinetic energy density @xcite and the constant @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 .",
    "we have assumed @xmath63 .",
    "the form @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ func ] ) suggests , with of course the exact density @xmath0 , the introduction of the thomas - fermi ( tf ) kinetic energy density defined by @xmath65 the constant @xmath66 is a multiplicative factor which we do not need to specify for the present purposes .",
    "thus , as in earlier work in this journal @xcite on the one - dimensional case of harmonic confinement , we obtain that @xmath67 and @xmath68 enter as building blocks the non - local kinetic energy density functional  ( [ func ] ) .",
    "in summary , we have derived two relatively simple equations , namely eqs .",
    "( [ vir3d ] ) and  ( [ turning ] ) , the first being a differential form of the virial theorem and the second relating turning points of kinetic energy density @xmath1 and particle density @xmath0 .",
    "these allow _",
