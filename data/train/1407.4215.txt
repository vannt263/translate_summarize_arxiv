    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators ( tis ) are materials that have a bulk bandgap but conducting surface states @xcite .",
    "these materials usually have strong spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the conducting surface states are protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the surface states have a linear dispersion relation and the quasiparticles ( dirac fermions ) at the surface obey the massless dirac equation .",
    "further , the surface states are helical where intrinsic angular momentum ( spin ) and translational momentum are locked to each other with the dirac cone centered at the time - reversal invariant momentum point in the brillouin zone with spin polarized berry phase@xcite ; which was confirmed by spin polarized angle resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "these helical dirac fermions exist on the edge of three - dimensional topological insulators such as @xmath0 @xmath1    the gapless surface states are primarily responsible for transport in topological insulators . in transport studies of tis ,",
    "a major challenge is to separate the bulk contribution from the surface contribution . since several tis",
    "are layered materials , thin films can be synthesized with the advantage that thin films of topological insulators have minimum bulk contribution .",
    "experiments on thin films are being actively pursued and it has been demonstrated that they exhibit thermoelectric effect@xcite , quantum spin hall@xcite , quantum anomalous hall effect@xcite and excitonic superfluidity@xcite . additionally , thin films provide an extra tunable degree of freedom which is their thickness .",
    "thin films where states of top and bottom surfaces hybridize exhibit even richer physics .",
    "this hybridization can happen for 1 - 5 quintuple layers with a thickness of the order of @xmath2@xcite .",
    "fabrication of @xmath3 thin film by molecular beam epitaxy@xcite as well as its low temperature transport studies have been reported in@xcite .",
    "hybridization leads to opening the gap in the surface state dispersion@xcite ; in other words , it provides mass to dirac fermions on the top and bottom surfaces .",
    "further , this gap can be tuned by the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "it has been shown that the response of ti thin films in an external magnetic field is highly nontrivial@xcite .",
    "ti thin films exhibit topological phases with phase transition that can be tuned by an external magnetic field . for surface state effects , the fermi level has to be in the bulk band gap which can be controlled by doping a ti@xcite or by a gate potential .",
    "another system that shares similarities with a ti thin film is bilayer graphene . at each valley , there are four parabolic bands in bilayer graphene , two valence and two conduction bands .",
    "two of these meet at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) exhibiting no energy gap in pristine bilayer ; the remaining two are split from these .",
    "gapless bilayer is a semi - metal but that can be changed .",
    "the gap can be opened and tuned by an electric field ( gate potential ) applied perpendicular to bilayer graphene sheets .",
    "this is in contrast to a ti thin film where there is a gap when the top and bottom surfaces are coupled and can be tuned by an applied magnetic field .",
    "the main question that we address in this work is the effect of hybridization between top and bottom surface states on the magneto - optical response in thin film tis . for this",
    ", we determine the complex frequency dependent longitudinal optical conductivity @xmath4 its real part gives the absorption as a function of photon energy .",
    "this has been carried out for graphene which shows good agreement between theory and experiment@xcite . recently in @xcite optical properties of topological insulator thin films doped with magnetic impurities has been investigated .",
    "the authors include hybridization effects and for exchange field that breaks time reversal symmetry show that the value of kerr and faraday rotation angles is large for a wide range of frequencies .",
    "magneto - optical properties of tis@xcite and other single layer material such as @xmath5@xcite and silicene@xcite have also been investigated .",
    "landau levels are formed in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "transitions between the landau levels generate absorption lines in the magneto - optical conductivity@xcite . in @xcite",
    ", these absorption lines were used to distinguish topological insulator phase and normal ( band ) insulator phase in silicene in the presence of spin orbit interaction and staggered potential . in this paper",
    ", we investigate topological phase transition in thin film of a topological insulator where hybridization between top and bottom surfaces is important .",
    "this will be done on the basis of information obtained from magneto - optical absorption spectra .",
    "we obtain the absorption spectra in both topological insulator phase and normal insulator phase as well as at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 and 3 we develop the theoretical model of a thin film topological insulator in a uniform external magnetic field . in section 4",
    ", we determine the longitudinal conductivity and transverse hall conductivity . in section 5 , response to circularly",
    "polarized light is considered . in section 6 , the topological phase transition in the semiclassical limit is investigated . in section 7 and 8 , effect of broken inversion symmetry and effect of warping in thin film topological insulator on landau levels has been discussed .",
