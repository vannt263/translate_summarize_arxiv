    "moreover it would provide information about @xmath5 resonance  @xcite and about @xmath0 meson properties in nuclear matter  @xcite , as well as about contribution of the flavour singlet component of the quark - gluon wave function of @xmath0 meson  @xcite .    according to the theoretical considerations",
    ", the formation of the @xmath0-mesic nucleus can only take place if the real part of the @xmath0-nucleus scattering length is negative ( attractive interaction ) , and the magnitude of the real part is larger than the magnitude of the imaginary part  @xcite :    @xmath6    calculations for hadronic- and photoproduction of the @xmath0 meson gave a wide range of possible values of the s - wave @xmath0n scattering lenght , from @xmath7=(0.27 + 0.22i ) fm up to @xmath7=(1.05 + 0.27i ) fm .",
    "such a high values has not exluded the formation of @xmath0-nucleus bound states for a light nuclei as @xmath8 , t  @xcite and even for deuteron  @xcite .",
    "those bound states have been searched in several past experiments  @xcite , however none of them gave empirical confirmation of their existence .",
    "there are only a promissing experimental signals which might be interpreted as   of the @xmath0-mesic nuclei .",

    "signals of the nuclei are searched for via studying the excitation function of specific decay channels of the system , formed in deuteron - deuteron collision  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0 meson can be absorbed by one of the nucleons inside helium and may propagate in the nucleus via consecutive excitation of nucleons to the @xmath11 state  @xcite until the resonance decays into the pion - nucleon ( n , @xmath12 or p , @xmath13 ) pair outgoing from the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the relative nucleon - pion angle is equal to @xmath14 in the @xmath15 reference frame and it is smeared by about @xmath16 in the center - of - mass frame due to the fermi motion of the nucleons inside the helium nucleus .    in june 2008 a search for the @xmath1-@xmath0 bound state was based on the measurement of the excitation function of the @xmath9 @xmath4 reaction near the @xmath0 production threshold .  during the experiment",
    "the deuteron beam momentum was varied continuously from 2.185  gev / c to 2.400  gev / c which corresponds the excess energy variation from -51.4 mev to 22 mev .",
    "excitation function was determined after applying cuts on the p and @xmath13 kinetic energy distribution and the @xmath17 opening angle in the cm system  @xcite .",
    "the relative normalization of points of the @xmath9 @xmath4 excitation function was based on the quasi - elastic proton - proton scattering . in the excitation function",

    ", two channels of the @xmath0-mesic helium decay were measured : @xmath2-@xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath2-@xmath3 @xmath18 @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "the measurement was performed with the beam momentum ramping from 2.127 gev / c to 2.422 gev / c , corresponding to the range of the excess energy . until now",
