    "the galactic center ( gc ) has long been suspected of harboring a central mass concentration , which appears to be coincident with the unique , nonthermal radio source , sgr a*. haller et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used the velocity dispersions of stars at @xmath2 pc from sgr a * to derive a compact mass of @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with the value of @xmath4 derived more recently by genzel et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , using the radial velocities and velocity dispersions of @xmath5 early - type stars and of @xmath6 red giants and supergiants within the central 2 pc .",
    "a third technique for tracing the central gravitational potential is based on the acquisition of proper motions for the @xmath7 brightest stars within the radial range @xmath8 pc ( eckart & genzel 1996 ; ghez et al .",
    "these stellar motions seem to require a central dark mass of @xmath9 , in good agreement with earlier ionized gas kinematics and the velocity dispersion measurements .    of course , showing that the gc must contain a centralized mass concentration does not necessarily imply that this dark matter is in the form of a compact object with a few million solar masses . it does not even imply that the unusual radio source sgr a *",
    "must be associated with it .",
    "vlba images of sgr a * with milliarcsecond resolution ( bower & backer 1998 ) show that at @xmath107 mm , its size is @xmath11 mas , or roughly @xmath12 cm , much smaller than @xmath13 pc , the present limiting region within which the @xmath14 are contained .",
    "so the dark matter may be distributed , perhaps in the form of white dwarfs , neutron stars , or @xmath15 black holes ( e.g. , haller et al .",
    "1996 ) , though the latest stellar kinematic results appear to rule out the first two possible constituents ( genzel et al .",
    "1996 ) .    whatever the composition of a distributed mass concentration is ,",
    "one is left with the task of accounting for the nature of sgr a * itself .",
    "it is likely that many of sgr a * s characteristics are associated with the liberation of gravitational energy as gas from the ambient medium falls into a central potential well ( melia 1994 ; see also ozernoy 1989 for an alternative conclusion regarding wind accretion ) .",
    "there is ample observational evidence in this region for the existence of rather strong winds in and around sgr a * itself ( from which the latter is accreting ) , e.g. , the cluster of mass - losing , blue , luminous stars comprising the irs 16 assemblage located within several arcseconds from the nucleus . measurements of high outflow velocities associated with ir sources in sgr a west ( krabbe et al .",
    "1991 ) and in irs 16 ( geballe et al .",
    "1991 ) , the @xmath16 emission in the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) from molecular gas being shocked by a nuclear mass outflow ( genzel et al .",
    "1996 ; but see jackson et al .",
    "1993 for the potential importance of uv photodissociation in promoting this @xmath16 emission ) , broad br@xmath17 , br@xmath18 and he i emission lines from the vicinity of irs 16 ( hall et al . 1982 ; allen et al . 1990 ; geballe et al .",
    "1991 ) , and radio continuum observations of irs 7 ( yusef - zadeh & melia 1991 ) , provide clear evidence of a hypersonic wind , with a velocity @xmath19 km s@xmath20 , a number density @xmath21 @xmath22 , and a total mass loss rate @xmath23 , pervading the inner parsec of the galaxy .",
    "even so , the observations do not yet provide sufficient information for us to identify the physics of accretion when the infalling gas penetrates to within about @xmath24 or @xmath25 schwarzschild radii of the central object .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations ( coker & melia 1997 ) indicate that the accreted specific angular momentum @xmath10 ( in units of @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the schwarzschild radius in terms of the black hole mass @xmath28 ) can vary by @xmath29 over @xmath30 200 years with an average equilibrium value for @xmath10 of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , even with a possibly large amount of angular momentum present in the wind , relatively little specific angular momentum is accreted .",
    "this is understandable since clumps of gas with a high specific angular momentum do not penetrate to within 1 @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the capture radius defined in terms of the wind velocity @xmath34 at infinity .",
    "the variability in the sign of the components of @xmath10 suggests that if an accretion disk forms at all , it dissolves , and reforms ( perhaps ) with an opposite sense of spin on a time scale of @xmath35 years .",
    "the captured gas is highly ionized and magnetized , so it radiates via bremsstrahlung , cyclo - synchrotron and inverse compton processes .",
    "however , for purely spherical accretion , the efficiency of converting gravitational energy into radiation is quite small ( as little as @xmath36 in some cases ) , so most of the dissipated energy is carried inwards ( shapiro 1973 ; ipser & price 1977 ; melia 1992 ) .",
    "in fact , if the magnetic field is a negligible fraction of its equipartition value ( see below ) , sgr a * would be undetectable at any frequency , except perhaps at soft x - ray energies . but",
    "as the plasma continues to compress and fall toward smaller radii , one or more additional things can happen , each of which corresponds to a different theoretical assumption , and therefore a potentially different interpretation .",
    "the questions one may ask include the following : ( 1 ) does the flow carry a large specific angular momentum so that it forms a disk with lots of additional dissipation ?",
    "( 2 ) does the flow produce a radiatively dominant non - thermal particle distribution at small radii ( e.g. , from shock acceleration ) , or does thermal emission continue to dominate the spectrum ? ( 3 ) does the flow lead to an expulsion of plasma at small radii that forms a non - thermal jet , which itself may then dominate the spectrum ?",
    "these , either individually or in combination , have led to a variance of assumptions about the nature of the inflowing gas that then form the basis for the development of different interpretations .",
    "observationally , a key issue is why the infalling gas maintains a low radiative efficiency .",
    "beckert & duschl ( 1997 ) suggest that shocks in the accreting plasma produce a power - law electron distribution , which is truncated by strong cooling .",
    "this forms a `` quasi '' mono - energetic distribution . the overall emission , which is strictly non - thermal , is suppressed by constraining the number density of relativistic particles and the intensity of the magnetic field ( at about 5 to 10 gauss ) .",
    "falcke , mannheim and biermann ( 1993 ) and falcke & biermann ( 1999 ) , on the other hand , assume that the infalling plasma eventually produces a jet of power - law electrons whose number density varies with radius in the expulsion .",
    "the overall emission , which is a sum of non - thermal components , is also suppressed by constraining the particle number density and hence the equipartition magnetic field , both of which are assumed to be scaled by a low luminosity disk .    in the picture developed by narayan , et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the infalling gas is assumed to carry a very large angular momentum , so that a disk forms with an outer radius at more than @xmath37 schwarzschild radii . to suppress the overall emission , which now includes the additional dissipation of this large angular momentum",
    ", it is also assumed that the electron temperature is much lower than that of the protons ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath39 k. since the electrons do the radiating , the efficiency remains small even though the protons are very hot .",
    "the idea that sgr a * s low radiating efficiency is due to a sub - equipartition magnetic field @xmath40 deserves further attention , especially in view of the fact that the actual value of @xmath40 depends strongly on the mechanism of field line annihilation , which is poorly understood .",
    "two processes that have been proposed are ( i ) the petschek ( 1964 ) mechanism , in which dissipation of the sheared magnetic field occurs in the form of shock waves surrounding special neutral points in the current sheets and thus , nearly all the dissipated magnetic energy is converted into the magnetic energy carried by the emergent shocks ; and ( ii ) van hoven s ( 1979 ) tearing mode instability , which relies on resistive diffusion of the magnetic field and is very sensitive to the physical state of the gas . in either case , the magnetic field dissipation rate is a strong function of the gas temperature and density , so that assuming a fixed ratio of the magnetic field to its equipartition value may not be appropriate .",
    "kowalenko & melia ( 1999 ) have used the van hoven prescription to calculate the magnetic field annihilation rate in a cube of ionized gas being compressed at a rate commensurate with that expected for free - fall velocity onto the nucleus at the galactic center . whereas the rate of increase @xmath41 in @xmath40 due to flux conservation depends only on the rate @xmath42 of the gas ,",
    "the dissipation rate @xmath43 is a function of the state variables and it is therefore not necessarily correlated with @xmath42 . although these attempts at developing a physical model for magnetic field dissipation in converging flows is still rather simplistic , it is apparent from the test simulations that the equipartition assumption is not always a good approximation to the actual state of a magnetohydrodynamic flow , and very importantly , that the violation of equipartition can vary in degree from large to small radii , in either direction .",
    "as such , calculations that assume equipartition of the magnetic field with the gas throughout the domain of solution may be greatly underestimating the importance of the deviations of @xmath40 from its @xmath44 value since the predicted spectrum relies critically on the contribution from magnetic bremsstrahlung .",
    "the first serious attempt at modeling the spectrum of sgr a * as being due to emission by the accreting gas was carried out by melia ( 1992 , 1994 ) , who assumed a black hole mass of @xmath45 . but this mass is no longer consistent with the now more accurately known value of @xmath0 , which accounts for a factor of @xmath46 increase in @xmath47 .",
    "in addition , the earlier calculations integrated the cyclo - synchrotron emissivity out to the lowest 20 harmonics only , which misses some of the contribution to the flux by the highest temperature gas at the smallest radii ( mahadevan , narayan & yi 1996 ) . in this paper",
    ", we recalculate the spectrum produced by a quasi - spherical infall onto sgr a * using the updated mass value , a more accurate handling of the magnetic bremsstrahlung and an empirical fit to the magnetic field , motivated by the simulations of magnetic dissipation discussed above . in section   2 , we derive the equations governing this spherical infall , which we adopt as a simplified version of the real accretion picture .",
    "of course , the real accretion flow will deviate from radial at small distances from the black hole , where the gas begins to circularize with its advected specific angular momentum . in a fully self - consistent calculation",
    ", we will use the distributions derived from an actual 3d hydrodynamic simulation as the basis for calculating the emissivity .",
    "the model parameters and results of our calculations are discussed in   3 , and we summarize our conclusions in   4 .",
    "we follow the sequence of derivations in shapiro ( 1973 ) , with the primary differences being the inclusion of the magnetic field and a radiation pressure term and the fact that we restrict out attention to supersonic flows .",
    "the equation of mass conservation reduces to @xmath48 where @xmath47 is the mass accretion rate onto the black hole , @xmath49 is the mass density of the accreting gas , @xmath50 is the radial component of the fluid 4-velocity ( but defined to be positive inwards , so that @xmath51 for the infalling plasma ) , and @xmath52 is the distance from the black hole . equation ( [ eq : mdoteq ] ) can be recast into the form @xmath53 where a prime denotes @xmath54 . at @xmath55 , where the numerical integration begins , we assume that the gas is non - relativistic and that the gravitational potential is weak .    the second equation , arising from momentum conservation , is the steady state relativistic euler equation for a spherical geometry : @xmath56 where the mass of the central black hole is given by @xmath28 , the total pressure is given by @xmath57 the non - magnetic pressure is given by @xmath58 the particle mass - energy density is @xmath59 and the internal energy density of the gas is @xmath60 in the fully ionized but non - relativistic limit ( i.e. , @xmath61 k ) , @xmath62 . on the other hand , in the relativistic electron limit ( @xmath63 k ) , @xmath64 .",
    "we use the general expression from chandrasekhar ( 1939 ) that is valid for all @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and k@xmath69 refers to the i@xmath70 order modified bessel function .",
    "we assume that the gas consists solely of completely ionized hydrogen .",
    "note that since we will assume a mostly radial @xmath40 ( see below ) , the numerator of equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) does not depend on the magnetic field .",
    "that is , there is no large scale current , since @xmath71 .",
    "the radiation pressure , @xmath72 , is given by the rayleigh - jeans approximation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the frequency below which the radiative emission is highly absorbed , so that the optical depth , @xmath75 , from @xmath52 to infinity is unity .",
    "this assumes that the accretion flow is relatively unimpeded by radiation pressure , or , in other words , that the accretion is sub - eddington . as mentioned in melia ( 1992 ) , with @xmath76 , ( zylka et al . 1995 ; shapiro and teukolsky 1983 ) , this certainly appears to be the case for sgr a*. numerically , this means that @xmath77 , which we verify _ a posteriori_.    the third primary equation follows from energy conservation , which we derive from the first law of thermodynamics : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the proper time in the gas frame .",
    "the use of @xmath80 rather than @xmath81 assumes that the compression of the gas is parallel to the magnetic field lines ( i.e. , radial inflow with a mostly radial @xmath40 ) .",
    "the heating ( @xmath82 ) and cooling ( @xmath83 ) terms render the flow non - adiabatic ( i.e. , @xmath84 ) .",
    "the radiative cooling includes magnetic bremsstrahlung and electron - ion and electron - electron thermal bremsstrahlung ( see melia 1994 , with an updated prescription in melia & coker 1999 ) . local uv heating from nearby stars results in a minimum gas temperature of @xmath85k ( tamblyn et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the shocked gas at the model s outer radius , @xmath55 , is expected to be hotter . thus , the major heating term ( other than the effects of compression ) is expected to be due to magnetic field reconnection .",
    "specifically , we use ( see ipser & price 1982 ) @xmath86 thus , if the magnetic field is flux conserved , for which @xmath87 , then no reconnection is taking place and @xmath88 . however , if the magnetic field remains in approximate kinetic equipartition with the gas , meaning that its pressure increases in tandem with the ram pressure of the accreting gas ( @xmath89 constant ) , then @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "since @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 will turn out not to be perfect power - laws , these statements are only approximate .    to find the velocity gradient , @xmath95 , we place the above definitions for @xmath80 and @xmath72 into equation ( [ eq : euler ] ) to get @xmath96 + { { 8k\\pi}\\over{9c^3}}[t^\\prime \\nu^3_m + t 3\\nu^2_m { \\nu^\\prime}_m]\\right ) -   { { gm}\\over{r^2}}\\;.\\ ] ] thus , substituting for @xmath97 from equation ( [ eq : nprime ] ) , we have , @xmath98 - v{{gm}/{r^2 } } } \\over{v^2 - 2nkth}}\\;,\\ ] ] where , for ease of writing",
    ", we have defined the quantity @xmath99 note that in the non - relativistic and small @xmath40 limit , @xmath100 . for simplicity ,",
    "we write @xmath95 as the sum of two terms : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103    the form of these expressions is that of the classic wind equations ( see , parker 1960 ; melia 1988 ) . in the simulations we consider here ,",
    "the gas is supersonic at @xmath55 and remains supersonic on its inward trajectory ( i.e. , for @xmath104 ) .",
    "we , therefore , avoid the special handling required for solutions that cross any sonic points , where the denominator of equation ( [ eq : vprime ] ) vanishes .",
    "since @xmath105 , equation ( [ eq:1st ] ) reduces to @xmath106 substituting in @xmath80 and @xmath107 , we get @xmath108 substituting in equation ( [ eq : nprime ] ) and explicitly taking the derivatives , we then obtain @xmath109    we use equations ( [ eq : vprime ] ) and ( [ eq : temp ] ) to determine @xmath95 and @xmath110 , respectively , then solve for @xmath111 and @xmath65 using an implicit differencing scheme , with @xmath112 where @xmath113 is a function of @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "similar relations hold for @xmath111 .",
    "thus , the whole flow is determined given some outer boundary conditions ( @xmath55 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 ; see below ) , the empirically inferred behaviour of @xmath119 , and a prescription for finding @xmath74 .",
    "note that boundary condition values for @xmath110 , @xmath95 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 are also needed ; at the outer boundary , we assume the flow is optically thin , in adiabatic free - fall with a thermal equipartition field and determine the derivatives accordingly .",
    "since the gas is not expected to be optically thin at low radio frequencies , the effective optical depth as a function of frequency must be determined before the radial profiles can be calculated . for sgr a * , we assume ( and check _ a posteriori _ ) that the energy absorbed at any given radius is small compared to the thermal and kinetic energy at that radius ; this is not likely to be true for objects that are accreting closer to their eddington luminosity .",
    "further , we assume that multiple scatterings are unimportant .",
    "following rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) , we use , for an effective optical depth in a zone of observed size @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) at infinity , @xmath124 where @xmath125 @xmath126 is the absorption coeffecient , @xmath127 is the electron number density , and @xmath128 is the electron scattering cross section .",
    "note that @xmath129 .",
    "the coefficient c in equation ( [ eq : taueq ] ) is a geometric term arising from the fact that in spherical symmetry , the average path length of a photon that reaches the observer is somewhat larger than @xmath122 .",
    "it is given by @xmath130 where @xmath131 is defined in equation ( [ eq : mumax ] ) .",
    "in equation ( [ eq : rprime ] ) , @xmath132 and @xmath133 is the average of the minimum of the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the flow ( which is here @xmath134 ) and the maximum , @xmath135 given by zeldovich & novikov ( 1971 ) .",
    "this maximum in @xmath136 is a consequence of the fact that not all of the emitted photons reach the observer ; some are captured by the black hole .",
    "note that @xmath131 changes sign and becomes negative at radii smaller than 1.5 @xmath137 .",
    "also , @xmath138 at the event horizon since the curvature in the trajectory of photons emitted at other angles takes them back into the event horizon .",
    "although @xmath79 has a more complex angular dependence , the use of @xmath133 in equation ( [ eq : rprime ] ) is a necessary simplification at this point .    for @xmath126",
    ", we use kirchoff s law , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the total emissivity ( in ergs @xmath22 s@xmath20 hz@xmath20 steradian@xmath20 ) and @xmath141 is the blackbody planck function . for the models discussed here , we use a total emissivity that includes cyclo - synchrotron emission ( coker & melia 1999 ) and electron - ion and electron - electron bremsstrahlung ( melia & coker 1999 ) .",
    "for @xmath128 we use the exact scattering cross section ( see , e.g. , lang 1980 ) @xmath142\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath143 and @xmath144 is the rms value of the thermal velocity at the temperature in the given zone .    finally , to find the total optical depth from zone @xmath145 out to infinity at some observed frequency @xmath146 , related to the emitted frequency @xmath147 by @xmath148 we use @xmath149 the minimum frequency @xmath74 that a photon needs to have in order to escape is found by iteratively determining the wavelength at which @xmath150 is unity with the caveat that @xmath74 not be less than the plasma frequency @xmath151 this caveat is required since photons with a frequency less than @xmath152 are unable to propogate and are thus trapped by the infalling gas .",
    "once the radial profiles ( optical depth , density , velocity , and temperature ) are determined , it is possible to calculate the emission spectrum for a given magnetic field profile .",
    "now we are ready to calculate the predicted observable luminosity @xmath153 at infinity ( see shapiro 1973 ; ipser & price 1982 ; and applied to sgr a * in melia 1992 , 1994 ) : @xmath154 where , if the emitting zone is optically thick ( i.e. , if @xmath155 ) , then @xmath156 otherwise @xmath157 in these two expressions , @xmath158 and @xmath159 depend on @xmath136 not @xmath133 .",
    "the use of @xmath160 here is a calculational simplification ; ideally , it too should be a function of @xmath136 .",
    "the sum over @xmath145 is truncated at @xmath161 , for which @xmath162 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath163 .",
    "this ignores the possible absorption by sgr a west of the low frequency ( @xmath164 hz ) radiation ( beckert et al . 1996 ) .",
    "sgr a west is an hii region surrounding sgr a*.",
    "the stellar winds that accrete onto sgr a * are thought to be hypermagnetosonic , so it is sensible to continue using the standard definition of an accretion radius ( eq . [ [ eq : radef ] ] ) , which is defined to be the point at which the gravitational potential energy is equal to the _ initial _ kinetic energy of the gas , but using an average of the stellar wind velocities weighted by the mass loss rate . for the galactic center , @xmath165 cm .",
    "however , this definition of @xmath32 does not necessarily give the physical radius at which the capture always occurs .",
    "for example , wind - wind collisions , combined with radiative cooling , can reduce the effective value of @xmath34 . for simplicity",

    "however , more recent work suggests that the mass loss rate of at least some of the central massive stars is less than previously thought ( hanson et al .",
    "1998 ) , so that @xmath168 may be smaller as well .",
    "if the gc wind is dominated by a source some distance @xmath170 away from sgr a * , then one would expect @xmath171 for example , if the @xmath172 wind from irs 13e1 ( which is thought to be @xmath173 pc away from sgr a * ; see melia & coker 1999 ) , dominates the flow , then @xmath174 .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath177 at 1 @xmath32 is thought to be a few milligauss ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "1996 ) but its large scale average value may be a few times smaller than this ( marshall et al .",
    "1995 ) . in practice",
    ", we use a value for @xmath177 such that at @xmath55 the magnetic field is close to thermal equipartition : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a parameter of order unity .",
    "together , @xmath47 and @xmath179 effectively determine the normalization of the model spectrum .",
    "> from a combination of hei line observations ( najarro et al .",
    "1997 ) and hydrodynamic modeling",
    "( coker & melia 1997 ) , the accreting wind is thought to be supersonic at @xmath55 with a temperature @xmath180 k and a velocity @xmath181 .",
    "the temperature , @xmath182 , and velocity , @xmath34 , of the individual stellar winds that accrete onto sgr a * are not necessarily the same as @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "wind - wind shocks and subsequent radiative cooling and acceleration result in @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "the winds , which originate well outside of 1 @xmath32 , are originally hypersonic with a mach number of 10 - 30 , but by the time they reach 1 @xmath32 , they are on average only mildly supersonic with a mach number of 1 - 3 .",
    "the non - zero velocity at infinity tends to make @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the free - fall velocity , while shocks tend to have the opposite effect , making @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we assume that @xmath184 is given by a fraction @xmath117 , of order unity , of the free - fall value . with @xmath166 and equation ( [ eq : radef ] )",
    ", we then have @xmath190 in order to end up with a supersonic accretion solution , it is also necessary to set @xmath183 to be less than the local virial temperature , i.e. , @xmath191 we parameterize the starting temperature according to the prescription @xmath192 , where again @xmath118 is of order unity",
    ".      some accretion models of sgr a * ( e.g. , narayan et al . 1995 ) assume that @xmath193 , requiring a deceleration mechanism fairly close to 1 @xmath32 . since @xmath183 and @xmath177 are too small to decelerate the inflowing gas , the most likely reason for @xmath184 being so small would probably be that the gas contains a greater specific angular momentum than is seen in the hydrodynamic simulations ( ruffert & melia 1994 ; coker & melia 1997 ) .",
    "with the wind originating from more than a dozen sources distributed fairly isotropically around sgr a * ( melia & coker 1999 ) , the time averaged specific angular momentum accreted by the black hole is likely to be small .",
    "this is the conclusion to which one is led with the current series of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the circularization radius at which the accreted specific angular momentum is equal to its keplerian value is @xmath194 where @xmath27 is the schwarzschild radius and @xmath10 is the accreted specific angular momentum in units of @xmath195 .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations suggest that @xmath10 is highly time variable with a value in the range @xmath196 .",
    "however , these calculations have had limited physical resolution near the black hole and they have therefore sampled the @xmath10 accreted within the region @xmath197 . as one would expect , tests have shown that smaller values of @xmath198 result in smaller values of @xmath10 carried across that threshold .",
    "thus , the average values for @xmath10 given above may be thought of as upper limits so that @xmath199 .",
    "similarly , the viscous transport of angular momentum outward and a possible mass loss via a wind off the disk ( see , e.g. , xu & chen 1997 ) should result in @xmath200 .",
    "numerical calculations as yet do not have the physical resolution to verify this in the case of sgr a*.    more importantly , these simulations indicate that the vector _",
    "direction _ of the accreted specific angular momentum is highly time variable and dependent on conditions outside of the accretion radius , with sign changes occurring on a time scale of 1 - 50 years .",
    "thus , with @xmath201 representing the length scale within the nascent disk ( though the distribution of angular momentum outwards may increase the disk s outer radius somewhat above this value ) , even if such a disk forms , it is not likely to be stable over a time scale of more than a few decades , since the gas contains no long term preferred angular momentum axis .",
    "recent work ( genzel 1998 ) suggests that the wind sources may have a small net rotation around sgr a * and , if the resulting additional angular momentum is not canceled in wind - wind collisions , then angular momentum could play a more significant role in the spectrum of sgr a * than we assume here .      in this paper , we do not attempt ( as kowalenko & melia 1999 did ) to determine the magnetic dissipation rate from first principles , but rather we will use our fits to the observed spectrum of sgr a * to infer empirically what the profile of @xmath40 should be in order to validate this picture . in other words , we have a sense of how @xmath40 might behave ( most likely different from simple equipartition ) based on the calculations of kowalenko & melia ( 1999 ) , and we use that algorithm for @xmath119 to fit the spectrum . we find that a 3 component profile is necessary and sufficient for this purpose .",
    "the profile of @xmath40 affects primarily the heating term , @xmath82 , and the magnetic bremsstrahlung emissivity , @xmath202 , as discussed above . with 3 components , we have 5 parameters describing the magnetic field : 3 power - law indices ( @xmath203 ) and the location of 2 breakpoints ( @xmath204 ) . since the magnetic field of the ism",
    "is observed to be approximately in thermal equipartition , we fix the first index , @xmath205 , so that @xmath206 , or @xmath207 .",
    "the shape of the final spectrum is sensitive to the remaining 4 parameters ( @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath211 ) but we find that one general configuration works best .",
    "the first breakpoint @xmath208 occurs at a few hundred @xmath137 , with @xmath212 constant ( i.e. , @xmath213 ) .",
    "interestingly , the second breakpoint @xmath210 is at @xmath214 , the radius of the last stable orbit for a non - rotating black hole . at that point , @xmath215 , which suggests the presence of a magnetic dynamo at small radii .",
    "these three segments of @xmath119 ( an equipartition region , a region of constant field intensity , and a dynamo region ) are all necessary to fit the general flat spectral shape of sgr a*. the equipartition region results in a sufficiently large field and temperature to reproduce the observed flux at low frequencies ( i.e. , @xmath216 hz ) with @xmath52 large enough so that the emission is not self - absorbed .",
    "the region of constant magnetic field is required to match the flat spectral index of @xmath217 ( lo 1986 ) at moderate radio frequencies ( @xmath218 hz ) . at @xmath219",
    "hz there is an observed sub - millimeter excess , presumably due to an ultra - compact component a few @xmath137 in size ( falcke et al .",
    "1998 ) ; our dynamo region produces this excess .",
    "there are many arguments ( see , e.g. , hawley & balbus 1992 ) for the presence of a magnetic dynamo close to a black hole so such a component is not implausible .",
    "the calculation of the magnetic bremsstrahlung contribution to @xmath140 assumes that @xmath136 , the cosine of the angle between the flow and the line of sight , is the same as the cosine of the angle between @xmath40 and the line of sight . for a spherical flow , in the absence of magnetic reconnection ( which should be minimal for @xmath220 anyway ) , @xmath221 , while @xmath222 .",
    "thus , even if the magnetic field at infinity is perfectly tangled , it is reasonable to assume that at @xmath55 , @xmath223 .",
    "however , because the magnetic field is divergence - less , the stretched out field lines must close somewhere . presumably this occurs quite close to the black hole . in a fully self - consistent calculation , we will use the distributions derived from an actual 3d hydrodynamic simulation as the basis for calculating the emissivity .",
    "we present the resulting spectrum of our best fit model in figure [ fig : specsize](a ) . for comparison with previous calculations ( e.g. , melia 1994 ) , we also plot results for a model which assumes only gravity acts to accelerate the accreting gas ( i.e. , @xmath224 ) .",
    "since the flow is only mildly supersonic at moderate radii , the assumption of free - fall is physically invalid , but such models do allow hotter gas to exist at larger radii and , thus , have more emission at lower frequencies than the full solution models .",
    "nonetheless , both model spectra are consistent with the observations over 16 decades of frequency .",
    "the parameters used in the two fits are given in table [ tab : specparms ] .",
    "note that one clear prediction of these models is that the source of the majority of the high energy @xmath18-ray emission is not sgr a * or its associated accretion flow , unless some exotic particle acceleration mechanism is operating within the inflow .",
    "this is consistent with recent models ( melia , yusef - zadeh , & fatuzzo 1998 ) , which suggest the gc high energy emission is due to sgr a east , a super - nova - like remnant near or possibly even enveloping sgr a*. the details of the predicted emission in the ir region are fairly sensitive to the details of radiative transport , since the gas circularizes at small radii , possibly producing a small disk which emits primarily in the ir .",
    "nonetheless , the next generation of infrared observations should be able to detect the emission from the inner @xmath225 of the black hole .",
    ".parameters for the sgr a * spectral fits [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     some of the observations used in figure [ fig : specsize](a ) are averaged over a span of years while others are contemporaneous . since the flux of sgr a * can vary with time by more than @xmath226 ( depending on frequency ) ,",
    "we do not necessarily wish to reproduce the entire suite of observations but rather the general trend .",
    "the resolution of the observations also varies greatly but most of the values reported in the table have backgrounds subtracted out and in principle refer to the flux of sgr a * only .",
    "those observations which have a potential for source confusion are plotted as upper limits .",
    "for example , at @xmath227 hz , the background emission due to , e.g. , dust at a temperature of 90k , is comparable to emission from sgr a * itself ( zylka et al . 1992 ) .",
    "this is particularly true in the infrared , where sgr a * has yet to be definitely identified and has a flux considerably less than that of the surrounding gas and stars , and in the x - rays and @xmath18-rays , where the poor spatial resolution is likely to result in multiple sources being in the field of view .",
    "similarly , observations at @xmath228 ghz are unreliable as limits for the luminosity of sgr a * due to source confusion , scattering , and self - absorption ( davies et al .",
    "in converting the observed fluxes to the luminosities plotted in figure [ fig : specsize](a ) , it is assumed that sgr a * is 8.5 kpc away .",
    "the predicted size of sgr a * is shown in figure [ fig : specsize](b ) .",
    "also shown are the present observational limits and measurements ( see lo et al .",
    "1998 for a summary of recent work ) . at present",
    "there are two observations which address the intrinsic diameter of the minor axis of sgr a*. however , these observations are difficult and , for example , may have had difficulties with calibration ( see , e.g. , krichbaum et al .",
    "the model satisfies the upper limit at 3.5 mm as well as the lower limit at 0.8 mm , but it predicts a source that is somewhat more compact than the other observations suggest .",
    "but while the observations tend to fit gaussian fwhm to the data , the predicted diameter is defined as the last scattering surface ( i.e. , @xmath229 $ ] ) . for a more detailed and accurate size comparison , one needs a more sophisticated treatment , using , for example , the theory of wave propagation in an extended , irregular medium ( melia , jokipii & narayanan 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , at small radii , the presence of angular momentum and asymmetries in the flow will result in a distended non - circular source shape .",
    "for example , at 7 mm the axial ratio is observed to be less than @xmath230 ( lo et al .",
    "thus , the model size results presented here should be taken as approximate lower limits .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spectandb ] we show the radial profiles for the temperature and magnetic field for the two fits shown in figure [ fig : specsize ] .",
    "the gas is always sub - virial ( @xmath231^{-1}$ ] ) with a peak temperature of @xmath232k .",
    "this peak temperature is within the present observed lower ( @xmath233k ; lo et al .",
    "1998 ) and upper ( @xmath234k ; gwinn et al . 1991 ) brightness temperature limits . only within @xmath235 of the black hole , where the gas becomes relativistic , is there significant magnetic bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "it is not a coincidence that @xmath208 is @xmath236 .",
    "the accreting gas must stay hot enough at such radii to produce the flat spectrum ; the constant magnetic field and subsequent heating via reconnection very nearly achieve this .",
    "however , this can not continue all the way down to the event horizon or else the resulting magnetic field is insufficient to produce the observed sub - millimeter excess and the gas gets too hot to continue accreting and becomes pressure supported .",
    "thus , we require a sharp increase in the magnetic field strength within @xmath225 of the black hole with a resulting peak magnetic field of @xmath35 gauss .",
    "we postulate that this may occur when the frozen - in magnetic field lines , which have been stretched out during the accretion process , finally close or are twisted by sheared gas motions due to a transition resulting from residual angular momentum in the flow ; however , if the viscosity is large , the bulk gas flow still remains primarily radial and supersonic ( narayan et al .",
    "as described by hawley and balbus ( 1992 ) , instabilities in the flow , possibly tied to differential rotation once the gas circularizes , may result in the generation of strong poloidal and toroidal fields , driving the magnetic field strength up to thermal equipartition , as required in our model .",
    "except in the transrelativistic region ( @xmath236 ) , the gas density and velocity profiles are close to that from free - fall so that n@xmath237 .",
    "by incorporating an enhanced treatment of the magnetic bremsstrahlung emissivity and solving the accretion flow equations explicitly , we have improved the accreting black hole model for sgr a * with resulting spectra that are consistent with observations over more than 16 decades of frequency .",
    "the mass accretion rate of @xmath238yr@xmath20 , as determined from the spherical accretion model , is consistent with the rate expected on the basis of observations and hydrodynamical arguments ( see , e.g , coker & melia 1997 ) .",
    "however , other models , such as an `` advection dominated accretion flow '' ( adaf ) with outflow ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) , require an accretion rate that is 2 or more orders of magnitude smaller than this .    there are some difficulties with the model .",
    "the full solution , using the euler equation , suggests that the flow may be transonic and that it may therefore shock at smaller radii .",
    "a shock could produce high energy particles , which would result in significant magnetic bremsstrahlung emission at larger radii ( markoff , melia , & sarcevic 1997 ) , thereby increasing the emission at lower frequencies .",
    "we hope to address this difficulty in future work .",
    "it is interesting that the break seen in the low energy @xmath18-ray observations coincides with the high energy turnover in the model , suggesting the presence of another , hotter source within the field of view of egret .",
    "in addition , we have effectively ignored the role played by angular momentum , the presence of which would introduce viscous processes that are even more poorly understood than magnetic reconnection .",
    "also , the handling of radiative transport has so far been very simplistic .",
    "inclusion of relativistic 3d radiative transfer , including ray bending and inverse compton , could potentially alter the resulting spectra significantly .",
    "the model suggests that if the accretion rate onto sgr a * is large ( @xmath238yr@xmath20 ) then the observed x - ray emission from the gc is due to the extended x - ray emission from this accretion process .",
    "however , the observations have a resolution on the order of arcminutes while the ` extended ' emission region from the model spans a few arcseconds . due to calibration difficulties and an uncertain column depth between here and the gc ,",
    "the observed x - ray limits are uncertain to within a factor of a few ( narayan et al . 1998 ) so the model is still marginally consistent with the x - ray observations .",
    "the next generation of observations ( such as with chandra ) will most likely settle this issue .",
    "the picture with which we have worked here under - predicts somewhat the low frequency radio emission . within the context of the model , unreasonable temperature and magnetic field profiles",
    "are required to fit the observations and even then the fit at other frequencies degrades .",
    "this difficulty is due to two things .",
    "first , the low frequency emission from close to the black hole is trapped so it does not contribute to the low frequency spectrum .",
    "second , gas with sufficient magnetization and temperature to produce the observed magnetic bremsstrahlung emission at large radii is gravitationally unbound and could not self - consistently accrete .",
    "an improvement to the model that addresses this low-@xmath147 deficiency in the spectrum may come with more realistic 3d simulations , which will be reported elsewhere .    finally , although we have briefly touched on the likely importance of the sub - millimeter excess to our understanding of the environment just outside the event horizon , this clearly is an issue that warrants further detailed theoretical work .",
    "taking into account scatter - broadening of the image in the interstellar medium , and the finite achievable telescope resolution , the @xmath239 `` shadow '' of the galactic center black hole ( see , e.g. , falcke , melia & agol 1999 ) should be well observable with very long - baseline interferometry at sub - millimeter wavelengths . in our picture , the dynamo effect that leads to the intensification of the magnetic field that accounts for this spectral excess may be due to the circularization of the infalling gas when it approaches the circularization radius @xmath240 ( see   3.1 ) .",
    "we are in the process of examining the behavior of the magnetized plasma when shearing motions become important in this region , and we will report on the results of this investigation in the near future ."
