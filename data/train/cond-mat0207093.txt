    "extensive research efforts have been made for increasing the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) in mgb@xmath2 since superconductivity in this compound was discovered @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used procedures are high pressure treatment and element substitutions as summarized in a recent review article by buzea and yamashita @xcite and references therein .",
    "it appears that all element substitutions caused crystal lattice contraction and reduced @xmath0 .",
    "the elements which do not considerably reduce @xmath0 are zn , si and li . however , all element substitutions reported so far are limited to single element doping . because of the rigid lattice structure and small number of elements in the mgb@xmath2 compound the level of substitution",
    "is substantially restricted , otherwise @xmath0 would be strongly depressed .",
    "furthermore , the majority of studies on substitution was carried out to replace mg except recent work on c @xcite and si @xcite substitutions aimed at replacing b.    another important goal of substitution is enhancement of pinning in mgb@xmath2 . in spite of impressive progress on improving the critical current density ( @xmath1 ) @xcite at temperatures above 20  k , which is considered to be the benchmark operating temperature for this material , @xmath1 rapidly drops with increasing magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) due to its poor pinning ability . if mgb@xmath2 is to be useful in high fields , the flux pinning strength must be improved .",
    "attempts have been made to enhance the flux pinning by oxygen alloying in mgb@xmath2 thin films @xcite and by proton irradiation of mgb@xmath2 powder @xcite , which led to an encouraging improvement of both irreversibility field ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 .",
    "the question is whether one can introduce effective pinning centers into mgb@xmath2 by chemical doping .",
    "numerous attempts have been made to improve flux pinning using this procedure .",
    "the results for doping into mgb@xmath2 reported so far are largely limited to addition rather than substitution of the doping elements .",
    "additives appeared to be ineffective for pinning enhancement at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , if doping elements are substituted into , instead added to mgb@xmath2 crystals , pinning properties can be much improved by induction of a net of intra - granular defects due to crystal lattice distortions and local fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "both can strongly contribute to pinning .",
    "indeed , pinning reinforcement research in mgb@xmath2 has to be focused on intra - granular pinning as the weak - link problem is insignificant for this material @xcite , unlike for high-@xmath0 systems .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to have a high level and multi - element substitution , creating effective pinning sites but not lowering @xmath0 dramatically . indeed , for mgb@xmath2 , the boron plane is responsible for superconductivity , therefore it is desirable for substitution to take place of b positions , which would induce local fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .    in our previous work @xcite , we doped mgb@xmath2 with sic nano - particle powder , producing mgb@xmath2(sic)@xmath9 compound where @xmath5 to 0.34 .",
    "it was found that the added sic was _ dissolved _ within the crystal lattice ; that si and c co - substitution resulted in a surprisingly modest reduction of @xmath0 ( only 2.6  k for @xmath10 ) ; and that vortex pinning was significantly increased , drastically improving @xmath8 behavior @xcite . however , from the doping procedure it was difficult to estimate the level of substitution upon increasing @xmath11 .",
    "excessive secondary phases also appeared , as 10  nm inclusions inside the mgb@xmath2 grains .",
    "it was not quite clear what was the predominating factor for the enhanced pinning : the substitution or the inclusions . in this detailed work ,",
    "we report not only the influence of sic co - substitution for b in the form of mgb@xmath3(sic)@xmath4 with @xmath11 varying from 0 to 1 on different aspects of superconductivity in its material , but also show that the substitution governs the improved @xmath8 performance , whereas impurities ( inclusions ) bear an assisting role , having a considerable contribution to the pinning of vortices presumably at relatively low fields .    in the next section",
    "we describe the sample preparation procedure and experimental details . in section [ disc ] , we show the effect of substitution on mgb@xmath2 crystal lattice contraction and phase composition ( sect .",
    "[ crlat ] ) ; in section [ vol ] we discuss reasons for a small critical temperature degradation for relatively high sic - doping level , and show that @xmath0 degradation due to the substitution is similar to the effect of hydrostatic pressure applied to mgb@xmath2 ; in section [ j ] we mainly deal with critical current density behavior as a function of the applied field and temperature , providing evidence for the improved performance as a result of sic doping procedure .",
    "we also propose a quantitative pinning mechanism to account for the @xmath8 behavior . in the last section",
    "we summarize the obtained results and conclusion .",
    "mgb@xmath2 samples were prepared by the in - situ reaction , which has been previously described in details @xcite .",
    "powders of magnesium ( 99% ) and amorphous boron ( 99% ) were well mixed with powder of sic nano - particles , varying from 10  nm to 100  nm in size , with an atomic ratio of mgb@xmath3(sic)@xmath4 , where @xmath5 , 0.04 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.65 , 0.8 , and 1.0 .",
    "the mixed powders were filled into fe tubes .",
    "the composite tubes were groove - rolled , sealed in a fe tube and then directly heated at preset temperatures to @xmath12c , for 1 hour in flowing high purity ar .",
    "this was followed by quenching to the liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "x - ray - powder diffraction ( xrd ) measurements were performed on undoped and sic - doped samples .",
    "the x - ray scans were recorded using cu@xmath13   , and indexed within the space group p6/mmm .",
    "microstructure and micro - composition were characterized using scanning electron microscope ( sem ) and transmission electron microscope ( tem ) equipped with an energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy analyzer ( eds ) and mapping analysis .",
    "the magnetization as a function of temperature @xmath14 and magnetic field @xmath6 applied along the longest sample dimension was measured using a quantum design magnetic property and physical property measurement systems within the field range @xmath15  t , and within the temperature range of @xmath16  k. a magnetic @xmath1 was derived from the half - width of magnetization loops @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are descending and ascending branches of the magnetization loop , respectively ) , using the following critical state model formula : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a geometrical factor , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 being sample thickness and width , respectively .",
    "all the samples were of a similar rectangular shape and size .",
    "because of the strong thermo - magnetic flux - jump instabilities the low field @xmath1 could not be measured at @xmath24  k.",
    "x - ray diffraction patterns for all the measured mgb@xmath2(sic)@xmath4 samples . ]    fig .",

    "the sample consists of a major phase with mgb@xmath2 structure . at @xmath33 minority phase mg@xmath2si and trace amount of mgo",

    "the amount of these non - superconducting phases was increased with increasing sic doping level . at @xmath34 to 0.2 , the minority phase mg@xmath2si occupied about 10% volume fraction .",
    "this minority phase increased to about 30% volume fraction for @xmath35 . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the amount of non - superconducting phases _ already exceeded _",

    "both crystal lattice axes are sharply reduced at low doping levels @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ cl ] ) , nevertheless the sample overwhelmingly remained as the single phase ( fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ) . after the sharp contraction",
    ", the @xmath28-axis continues to moderately decrease with increasing doping level till the nominal composition @xmath39 is reached . in the same time , the @xmath31-axis remains almost constant .",
    "the negligible @xmath31-axis variations are within the experimental error .",
    "these results suggest that at the low doping level the sic - dopant is to a large extent dissolved in the mgb@xmath2 crystal lattice .",
    "as the doping level grows the substitution effect slows down , but it can still be quite effective up to @xmath40 , where the @xmath28-axis change reaches a quasi - plateau ( fig .  [ cl ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the slow variation in the @xmath28-axis with increasing sic doping level indicates that b was substituted by c and si . in comparison ,",
    "pure c substitution for b resulted in a reduction of the @xmath28-axis from 3.085 to 3.070 at @xmath41 @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ cl ] ) , while the co - doping of si and c for b reached the similar level of the @xmath28-axis reduction at the nominal composition @xmath39 .",
    "this is an order magnitude higher than the single c doping ( fig .",
    "it is clear that the si and c substitution raised the saturation level considerably .",
    "it is probably due to the fact that the average atomic radius of c ( 0.91   ) and si ( 1.46   ) closely matches that of b ( 1.17   ) .",
    "therefore , this co - doping counter - balanced the negative effect of the single element doping @xcite .",
    "the formation of mg@xmath2si phase could not consume all of si , the crystal lattice would then show a similar contraction to the one obtained for the single element c - doping @xcite ( see fig .  [ cl ] ) accompanied by the strong decrease of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "this was not observed in our experiment ( see sect .  [ vol ] ) .",
    "the eds analysis results taken on single grains of @xmath42 ( a ) and @xmath43 ( b ) samples .",
    "it shows the co - existence of si , c , b , and mg within each single grain .",
    "a small cu - peak in ( b ) appeared due to the background signal from the sample holder . ]",
    "the simultaneous incorporation of c and si into the lattice structure is also supported by energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy analysis on single grains of mgb@xmath2 .",
    "the analysis clearly shows that si and c co - exist with mg and b within the same grain ( fig .",
    "[ edx ] ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath44 ratio obtained for samples having different doping levels quantitatively correlates with the corresponding doping level of the sample .",
    "however , we observed local variations of the signal intensity for c and si across each analyzed grain , suggesting very local variations in the substitution level and making a qualitative assessment impossible .",
    "this is in contrast to mg and b , which appear to be rather uniformly distributed across each analyzed grain . in fig .",
    "[ edx ] , we present the spectral analysis for two samples having @xmath42 ( a ) and @xmath43 ( b ) .",
    "note that the b - peak intensity became comparable to the intensities of si- and c - peaks for the higher doping level sample ( fig .",
    "[ edx](b ) ) , pointing out that si and c replace b within the mgb@xmath2 grains .",
    "the spectral analysis clearly shows an o peak within the mgb@xmath2 grains ( fig .",
    "[ edx ] ) .",
    "the oxygen itself could be brought into the material by sic dopant which can absorb oxygen and moisture during storage .",
    "there are two reasons why oxygen peak appears in the eds spectrum within the grains .",
    "firstly , it might be due to oxygen alloying in boron layers , which was reported to result in strong pinning in the mgb@xmath2 thin films @xcite .",
    "secondly , the oxygen peak may be attributable to the presence of mgo nano - size inclusions formed within the grains .",
    "the critical temperature onset @xmath45 versus the doping level for all the measured samples . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath0 for the single element doping taken from ref .   is also shown . ]",
    "figure  [ tcx ] shows the onset of critical temperature @xmath45 as a function of the doping level , as obtained by zero - field cooled magnetization measurements at @xmath46  oe .",
    "the onset was defined at @xmath47  emu/@xmath48 . for undoped sample ,",
    "@xmath49  k. for the doped samples , @xmath45 decreases almost monotonically with increasing doping level .",
    "surprisingly , the degradation of @xmath45 slows down , and likely reaches a quasi - plateau for @xmath50 , whereas for samples having @xmath51 the bulk superconductivity vanishes , at least in the measured temperature range of @xmath52  k. the total @xmath45 drop is only 2.4  k for the superconducting samples with the sic doping level up to @xmath53 ( nominal composition ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath0 was depressed by almost 7  k in the case of pure c doping in mgb@xmath3c@xmath9 with @xmath42 @xcite ; @xmath0 was reduced by about 0.5  k in the case of si substitution in mgb@xmath3si@xmath9 with @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "the latter result suggested that silicon substitution has much less dramatic effect on depression of @xmath0 compared to carbon .",
    "there is no data available for a higher si doping level .",
    "these results also support the idea of the counter - balance effect caused by c and si co - substitution , producing the higher @xmath0 tolerance to mgb@xmath2 structural changes induced by sic doping .",
    "it is evident that the co - doping counter - balanced the negative effect on @xmath0 of the single element doping .    the crystal lattice unit cell volume change versus @xmath45 for the investigated doping range .",
    "the dotted line is a linear fit to the data . ]",
    "as widely discussed in the literature , there are two factors : lattice structure change and electronic structure change that influence @xmath0 @xcite . from pressure experiments",
    ", it was found that @xmath0 decreases almost linearly with decreasing lattice volume ( see the review paper and references therein ) .",
    "as far as the lattice volume change is concerned , the c substitution for b would cause contraction of the crystal lattice and , hence , reduction of the unit cell volume ; whereas the si substitution for b would lead to expansion of the lattice and increase of the unit volume .",
    "thus , it is plausible for mgb@xmath2 to accommodate larger amounts of c and si , than in the case of the single element doping",
    ". the larger level of substitution could bring forward an additional @xmath0 suppressing factor .",
    "indeed , the reduction may occur not only due to the lattice contraction , but also due to alteration of the electron configuration with the doping . to assess each of the possible contributions ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath45 versus crystal lattice unit cell volume as shown in fig .",
    "the resulting dependence is rather linear .",
    "similar linear dependences have been obtained for pressure experiments on pure mgb@xmath2 material @xcite .",
    "therefore , this similarity enables us to conclude that our co - substitution produces the same effect on @xmath0 as in the case of the pressure induced volume decrease , indicating that the volume ( structural ) factor plays the dominant role in affecting @xmath0 in si and c co - doped mgb@xmath2 system .",
    "effect of sic doping on @xmath8 behavior of selected investigated samples compared to the pure mgb@xmath2 sample at @xmath55  k ( a ) , 10  k ( b ) , 20  k ( c ) , and 30  k ( d ) . ]    fig .",
    "[ jc ] shows the @xmath8 curves for selected samples at @xmath55  k ( a ) , 10  k ( b ) , 20  k ( c ) , and 30  k ( d ) . the most striking feature shown in this figure is that @xmath8-curves for samples with a wide range of doping cross the curve of the pure ( @xmath5 ) mgb@xmath2 sample , exhibiting significantly higher critical current densities at higher applied fields .",
    "this is consistent with our first report on mgb@xmath2(sic)@xmath9 samples @xcite .",
    "the behavior is valid for the samples having the doping range of @xmath56 , however @xmath8-curves in fig .",
    "[ jc ] are shown not for all measured samples for clarity .",
    "for example , samples in the doping range of @xmath57 have shown hardly distinguishable @xmath8-behavior .",
    "it is important further to note at least two more interesting features revealed by our study .",
    "( i ) the sample having @xmath39 , showed a relatively good @xmath8 performance in high fields and @xmath58  k ( fig .  [ jc ] ) , but the striking is that it has as much as more than 50% volume fraction of _ non - superconducting phase _ , according to the xrd results shown in fig .",
    "( ii ) at low doping level @xmath32 the @xmath8 behavior is surprisingly worse not only than that for the pure sample , but also for the higher doping level samples ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "below , we shall discuss possible reasons for the described @xmath8 behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ jc ] , and draw possible pinning mechanisms responsible for this behavior .",
    "first , for our case we rule out the densification effect reported in the literature @xcite for different doping materials , leading to a @xmath1 increase in rather low fields and temperatures .",
    "this would mean that , instead of introducing pinning into mgb@xmath2 , doping would help increase the density of the material , which would increase the effective cross - sectional area for supercurrent transport and reduce its percolative flow . in contrast to their works @xcite but similarly to the work on y@xmath2o@xmath60 nano - particle doping @xcite , sic doping showed no densification effect as evidenced by the fact that the density of our samples is independent of the doping level and equal to approximately 1.2  g/@xmath61 .",
    "this is less than 50% of the theoretical density for this material , 2.63  g/@xmath61 .",
    "this can be understood because melting temperature of sic is very high and sic would not act as sintering aid in the temperature range of @xmath62 to 950@xmath63c .",
    "thus , the densification can not be claimed responsible for the improved @xmath8 behavior at high fields in our doped samples .    in order to describe the origin of pinning enhancement which is responsible for the obtained @xmath8 behavior ,",
    "it is necessary to recognize the unique feature of sic doping emphasized in the previous sections .",
    "it takes place in the form of the prevailing substitution and addition , while in works reported in the literature @xcite element doping was in the form of additives , either not incorporated into the crystal lattice or incorporated to a lesser extent than in our work .",
    "this indicates that @xmath1 is very sensitive to the way impurities are introduced .",
    "a question arises , what kind of implications does the _ substitution _ have on pinning properties of the material ?",
    "tem images of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 samples .",
    "a high dislocation density within grains is shown in ( a ) .",
    "dislocations and round shape inclusions are present within each grain ( b ) .",
    "the number of inclusions increases with the doping level ( c ) .",
    "the solid and dotted arrows mark dislocations and inclusions , respectively . ]    as already shown in fig .",
    "[ cl ] , the substitution causes the crystal lattice parameters to contract inducing local lattice strains in mgb@xmath2-framework .",
    "this would create not only local fluctuation of the superconducting order parameter , but also appearance of a number of crystal defects .",
    "indeed , our transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) investigations clearly show a large number of dislocations within each mgb@xmath2 grain ( fig .",
    "[ tem](a ) ) , which are similar to those shown in our previous report @xcite .",
    "dislocations are known to serve as strong pinning centers @xcite .",
    "very limited structural study of the mgb@xmath2 superconductor available in the literature indicated that pure mgb@xmath2 has only very few atomic - scale dislocations @xcite , which can hardly provide strong pinning in high fields .",
    "therefore , the high density of the dislocations induced by the substitution and revealed by tem is a strong intra - granular source of pinning .",
    "the dislocation size is estimated to vary from 5  nm to 30  nm which , in average , is larger only by a factor of about 2 than the coherence length @xmath64 in mgb@xmath2 superconductor @xcite .",
    "this makes them perfect pinning sites , because each vortex line has the diameter of the normal core of @xmath65 .",
    "another contributing source of pinning , as in the case of y@xmath2o@xmath60 doping @xcite , is non - superconducting nano - size precipitates , the amount of which grows with increasing doping level , as evident by the xrd patterns ( fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ) .",
    "indeed , the tem study shows 2  nm to 10  nm large round shape particles , presumably mg@xmath2si , existing within each mgb@xmath2 grain ( fig .",
    "[ tem](b , c ) ) .",
    "note , the inclusions are in average one order of magnitude smaller than initially added sic - particles , indicating that the size of the initial dopant powder is not crucial for the final effect .",
    "moreover , the amount of these inclusions increases with increasing doping level , in particular starting from @xmath66 . at lower doping , fewer inclusion particles are observed . the optimal @xmath8 dependence is reached for the sample with @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ jc ] ) when the volume fraction of the non - superconducting impurity mg@xmath2si content was about 30% ( fig .",
    "[ xrd ] ) .",
    "a further @xmath11-increase starts to worsen the @xmath8 behavior , and , at the same time , the @xmath28-axis of the crystal lattice parameter exhibits a quasi - plateau within the experimental error ( fig .",
    "this correlation points out that the optimal @xmath8 behavior is reached when the substitution effect has reached its saturation . presumably , because at this stage maximum amount of dislocations and rather high level of inclusions , balanced with a reasonable amount of superconducting phase co - exist .",
    "further b replacement leads to the gradual elimination of the superconducting phase and , hence , worsening of @xmath8 performance .",
    "the above arguments , together with the fact that inclusions alone @xcite had a less pronounced effect than in our case , lead to a conclusion that at high fields the substitution , inducing a strongly developed net of dislocations , is the dominating source of the pinning in the material , which is possibly aided by the localized superconducting order parameter fluctuations .",
    "the secondary , however rather significant role , is held by the nano - size impurities confined within the grains .",
    "however , the point - like round shape inclusions seen in fig .  [ tem](b , c ) can be effective only in the case of their extremely high density , since their pinning ability is of a  collective \" nature due to their point - like action .",
    "this influence would be less pronounced in high fields when the vortex - vortex interaction is very strong , which makes the vortex lattice more rigid , so that the point - like defects become less important .",
    "since the thermally activated processes seem to be negligible in mgb@xmath2 superconductor , it is likely that the point - like pinning would be temperature independent .",
    "this is in contrast to dislocations ( extended defects ) which pinning efficiency would be influenced by the temperature dependence of the coherence length .",
    "the higher the temperature , the shorter the coherence length , the weaker the pinning since the dislocation size remains unchanged .",
    "this behavior is seen in the experiment : at @xmath68  k the high - field part of @xmath8-curves is much stronger for the best doping performance ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this is an additional piece of the evidence to favor our scenario .    the irreversibility field as a function of @xmath11 for different temperatures .",
    "at lower temperatures @xmath24  k , @xmath7 for the samples within @xmath57 doping range is increased beyond the field range accessible by our measuring equipment . ]    in figure  [ irr ] the available irreversibility fields as a function of doping level are plotted for all the samples .",
    "unfortunately , the upper field limitation in our experimental techniques did not allow us to measure @xmath7 for some samples at @xmath24  k , since the @xmath7 increase for these samples having doping level within @xmath57 was too large .",
    "however , we would like to note that the sample with @xmath39 has @xmath7 larger than that of the pure sample at @xmath68  k ; whereas at @xmath69  k it becomes smaller than the corresponding value of the pure sample .",
    "this is in support of our temperature dependence of the pinning mechanism outlined above .    a puzzling situation is imposed by the lowest doping level sample having @xmath70 .",
    "it shows the @xmath8 behavior which is worse than most of the other samples except the one with highest  superconducting \" doping level @xmath53 .",
    "similar behavior was observed in our preceding work @xcite , but it remained unexplained .",
    "this behavior is also well seen in fig .",
    "there is a minimum at @xmath70 , which is the easiest to notice for @xmath69  k. we speculate that because of too - small level of substitution , neither sufficiently large density of dislocations nor inclusions could be formed .",
    "on the other hand , the doping did cause a significant crystal lattice contraction , which might have lead to strongly distorted super - current paths ( for example due to a higher level of porosity ) leading to the poor @xmath8 behavior observed .",
    "the main result of this work is the introduction of atomic substitutions of both si and c in the crystal lattice of the mgb@xmath2 superconductor .",
    "this was possible due to the counter - balanced atomic size of si and c , in average nearly coinciding with the size of b. the substitution was shown to prevail up to rather high doping level @xmath71 in the mgb@xmath3(sic)@xmath4 composition . at higher doping level the doping results in impurities , which eventually suppress the bulk superconductivity .",
    "the substitution was shown to very strongly improve @xmath8 dependence at high applied fields .",
    "we suggested a pinning mechanism explaining this improvement , in which the main intra - granular ingredients are the dominating contribution of a large number of dislocations induced by substitution effect and the secondary contribution of the nano - inclusions .",

    "<S> we investigated the effect of sic nano - particle doping on the crystal lattice structure , critical temperature @xmath0 , critical current density @xmath1 , and flux pinning in mgb@xmath2 superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> a series of mgb@xmath3(sic)@xmath4 samples with @xmath5 to 1.0 were fabricated using in - situ reaction process . </S>",
    "<S> the contraction of the lattice and depression of @xmath0 with increasing sic doping level remained rather small due to the counter - balanced effect of si and c co - doping . the high level si and c co - doping allowed the creation of intra - grain defects and highly dispersed nano - inclusions within the grains which can act as effective pinning centers for vortices , improving @xmath1 behavior as a function of the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced pinning is mainly attributable to the substitution - induced defects and a local structure fluctuations within grains . </S>",
    "<S> a pinning mechanism is proposed to account for different contributions of different defects in mgb@xmath3(sic)@xmath4 superconductors . </S>"
