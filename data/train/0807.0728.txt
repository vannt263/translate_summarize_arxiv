    "( 1994 ) , who described the optical spectrum to be of wolf - rayet type , and proposed that the x - rays could arise in the colliding winds of a wn+ob binary system .",

    "this routine provides an estimation of errors for each fitted parameter .",
    "for example , in the fitting of the heii 4686  emission lines , we obtained errors in line position of about 11 km s@xmath2 and 6 km s@xmath2 , for the casleo and echelle spectra , respectively .",
    "the spectra were first normalized to the continuum and , to standardise the rv measurements in the broad lines , we used the position of the core of the line ; this procedure has the advantage of being less dependent on the errors in the definition of the continuum .",
    "we do not have any target in common among the different instruments , which could be used as a comparison star to investigate possible wavelength zero - point differences .",
    "the different spectral coverages prevented a suitable characterization of any such differences by means of interstellar lines .",
    "however , as will be shown in section  4 , we did not detect any significant shifts within our measurement errors .",
    "figure  [ splow ] shows a low - resolution optical spectrum of wack  2134 , obtained at saao .",

    "n  iii is faint , and n  v is observed in absorption .",
    "faint absorption lines of h and he  ii are also present .",
    "the observed optical spectrum of wack  2134 resembles that of hd  93162 ( @xmath6 wr  25 ) , a wn6 ha type star and the second brightest x - ray source in the carina nebula ( ngc3372 ) , which has also been recently unveiled as a massive binary system ( gamen et al .",
    "the spectrum of wack  2134 presents intrinsic h and he  ii absorptions ( see below ) , as well as the c  iv and n  iv emissions with comparable intensities .",
    "an effort to classify this star has been made by reig ( 1999 ) .",
    "he found spectral evidence for a wn+of classification , i.e. a very broad , high - intensity he  ii @xmath7 emission line but nitrogen ( n  v @xmath04604 and @xmath04620 ) and hydrogen absorption lines .",
    "however , the fwhm of the he  ii @xmath7 emission line is narrower than 30   and , in the following section , we demonstrate that the observed absorption lines move in phase with it , so they belong to the same star .",
    "thus , we prefer to classify wack  2134 as o3  f*/wn6 ha , i.e. as a massive star in an intermediate evolutionary stage between an o - type and a wolf - rayet star similar to those found in the r136 cluster ( at the center of the 30 doradus nebula in the large magellanic cloud ) , cf .",
    "melnick ( 1985 ) , walborn & blades ( 1997 ) , massey & hunter ( 1998 ) .",
    "many strong interstellar features are observed in the spectrum , indicating that it is a heavily reddened star .",
    "spectral lines of the secondary component are observed in our high resolution echelle spectra obtained during both quadratures of the binary system ( see below ) .",
    "these lines correspond to absorptions of h and he  ii .",
    "he  i lines are not visible in our spectra .",
    "therefore , the secondary component certainly is an early o - type star , probably as early as o4 .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary may not be much earlier than this , since we observe single",

    "we introduced the he  ii emission line radial velocities into a lafler & kinmann ( 1965 ) period search routine .",
    "the radial velocities from our spectra do not show large variations from one night to the next , but considerable variations are present between data obtained during different observing runs , thus suggesting a binary period longer than 10 days .",
    "the best period found was 31.67 days , with some aliases , i.e. 40.68 , 45.64 , 63.34 days .",
    "an inspection of the distribution of the radial velocities phased with each of those periods readily indicated that the most suitable is 31.67 days and that the orbit of wack  2134 is very eccentric .",
    "the period of 31.67 days was then introduced as an initial value into a routine for defining the orbital elements of the binary . to this end",
    "we used an improved version of the program originally written by bertiau & grobben ( 1969 ) . taking into account the different instrumental configurations involved in our dataset but also the spectral s / n , we decided to weight the spectra such that echelle data were assigned a value of 1 and the lowest resolution spectrum 0.1 .",
    "thus , saao data were weighted with 0.1 , casleo with 0.4 , and ctio with 0.8 .",
    "we inspected the individual @xmath9 values derived by the program looking for systematic rv shifts , but in all cases the mean of the @xmath9 ( of each dataset ) remained below 30 km  s@xmath2 , which we considered as a conservative internal error .",
    "thus we did not apply any zero - point corrections to the data .",
    "we calculated the orbital elements of wack  2134 independently with the radial velocities of the he  ii and n  iv emissions and the n  v absorptions .",
    "we adopted the period determined with the most numerous set of radial velocities from the he  ii emission also for the orbit of the n  v absorptions and n  iv @xmath04058 emission .",
    "we obtained eccentric orbital solutions , @xmath10 for the three datasets .",
    "similar times of periastron and of maximum radial velocity found in each dataset indicate that these lines move together , thus belonging to the same component .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for the c  iv emission lines , confirming that c and n lines are formed in the same envelope .",
    "the orbital elements for the different datasets of radial velocities are listed in table  [ orbital ] .",

    ". the higher amplitude of the radial velocity variations of the he  ii emission in principle could arise from distortions of the emission line by a superimposed absorption moving in anti - phase , i.e. a he  ii absorption originating in the atmosphere of the secondary component .",
    "however , our spectra do not show any clear evidence for an absorption line originating in the secondary component . on the other hand ,",
    "if the secondary component were of earlier spectral type , i.e. an o3 star which also shows n  v absorptions in its spectrum , then blending of both components could explain the lower amplitude of the radial velocity variations of these absorption lines .",
    "spectra of higher s / n and resolution are needed to verify these hypotheses .",
    "our high - resolution echelle spectra obtained during orbital phases close to the quadratures ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) show double absorption lines of h and he  ii , most clearly seen in he  ii @xmath05411 , as illustrated in figure  [ 5411 ] . measuring the component of the he  ii @xmath05411 absorption line belonging to the assumed o companion in the echelle spectra taken during quadratures ( four spectra obtained during maximum rv but only one presenting minimum rv ) , we obtained a difference in radial velocities of about 541 km s@xmath2 between quadratures .",
    "when we did the same with the absorption lines from the wn component , we obtained a radial - velocity difference of about 352 km s@xmath2 , which means an orbital semi - amplitude of 174 km s@xmath2 , in good agreement with the n  iv and he  ii emission lines . assuming that the radial velocity orbit defined by the he  ii @xmath04686 emission represents the orbital motion of the primary ( wn ) component , and the radial velocities of the he  ii @xmath05411 absorption line ( corrected by the difference between the systemic velocities of both components ) show the secondary orbital motion , we performed a fit of the orbital solution .",
    "the new sb2 orbital solution implies very high minimum masses for the binary components , namely 87@xmath16 m@xmath3 for the primary wn type component , and 53@xmath14 m@xmath3 for the o4 : type secondary component .",
    "this solution is depicted in figure  [ vrs5411 ] .",
    "if the radial velocity orbit of the n  v absorptions represents the true orbital motion of the primary , then the minimum masses of the primary and secondary components would be 83@xmath122 m@xmath3 and 47@xmath114 m@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "similar values were obtained when we used both components of the he  ii @xmath05411 absorption line as representing the orbital motion of each star in the system .    with the high minimum masses found from our radial velocity orbit",

    "wack  2134 has been monitored in @xmath27 magnitude by the all sky automated survey ( asas ) ( cf . pojmaski 2001 ) .",
    "we have examined the public asas data of this star .",
    "no obvious variations were found in the v magnitudes when we folded them at the spectroscopic binary period of 31.673 days .",
    "however , as wack  2134 is near the faint magnitude limit of the asas survey , the v magnitudes show rather high noise .",
    "more accurate photometry is needed to rule out , or confirm , the eclipsing nature of this binary .",
    "from the radial - velocity variations of the he  ii @xmath04686 emission line in the spectrum of the wn - type star wack  2134 , we found a most probable period p=31.673@xmath10.002 days , thus revealing wack  2134 as an eccentric binary system ( e=0.64@xmath10.03 ) .",
    "our higher - resolution spectra taken during quadratures show h and he  ii resolved into two components .",
    "we could obtain an orbital solution for the secondary component measuring the he  ii @xmath05411 absorption line in those spectra , but this orbit has only one measurement at one of the quadratures ( see fig .",
    "[ vrs5411 ] ) . using the he  ii @xmath04686 emission line and the he  ii @xmath05411 absorption line to follow the motion of the wn and o component , respectively",
