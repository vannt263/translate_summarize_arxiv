    "recently , a unified approach to describe charged particle production in high - energy collisions and describing two distinct mechanisms of hadroproduction has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested to approximate the charged particle spectra as a function of the particle s transverse momentum @xmath0 by a sum of an exponential ( boltzmann - like ) and a power law distributions : @xmath1 where @xmath2 with m equal to the produced hadron mass .",
    "@xmath3 are the free parameters to be determined by fit to the data .",
    "according to this approach , the exponential part stands for the release of `` thermalized '' particles by the preexisting valence quarks and a quark - gluon cloud coupled to them inside the colliding baryon .",
    "the power - law term accounts for the fragmentation of mini - jets formed by the secondary partons ( gluons ) produced with a relatively large @xmath4 at the first stage of the collision , that can be described within the pqcd . from this qualitative picture of hadroproduction one can naively expect that the spectra of charged hadrons in @xmath5 collisions should be described by the power - law term alone due to the absence of `` thermalized '' quarks and gluons in the colliding systems .",
    "such behavior has also been proven recently  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare the shapes of charged particles produced in these two types of interactions ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) with a more complex case of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is suggested to look at the recent data on lead - lead collisions measured by the alice collaboration  @xcite in the range of transverse momentum @xmath0 up to @xmath7 gev .",
    "figure  [ fig.1 ] shows experimental data on @xmath5  @xcite , @xmath6  @xcite and lead - lead  @xcite collisions fitted with the parameterization introduced  ( [ eq : exppl ] ) .",
    "one can notice , that this parameterization can not describe the shape of the spectra in lead - lead collisions for the very high-@xmath0 values and an additional power - law term is needed : @xmath8    note , that an additional power - law term in lead - lead collisions might be explained by the peculiar shape of the nuclear modification factor @xmath9 .",
    "figure  [ fig.2 ] shows @xmath9 for lead - lead collisions measured at alice  @xcite together with the lines showing contributions from the three terms of eq .",
    "( [ eq : expplpl ] ) independently , each of them divided over the spectrum in @xmath6-collisions measured at the same c.m.s . energy  @xcite .",
    "one can notice , that each of these terms contribute to different regions of the transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the observed behavior might be explained by the following picture of hadroproduction in heavy - ion collisions :    1 .",
    "the bulk of low-@xmath0 particles originates from the quark - gluon soup formed in the heavy - ion collision and has an exponential @xmath0 distribution , as shown by the red dashed line in figures  [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] .",
    "the high-@xmath0 tail ( shown by the green solid line in figures  [ fig.1 ] and  [ fig.2 ] ) accounts for the mini - jets that pass through the nuclei , the process that can be described in pqcd  @xcite .",
    "when these jets hadronize into final state particles * outside * the nuclei , we get the same power - law term parameter @xmath10 as in @xmath6-collisions ( figures  [ fig.1 ] b ) and c ) ) , resulting in a constant suppression ( @xmath9 ) of high-@xmath0 ( @xmath11 gev ) particles ( figure  [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "note , that while passing through the nuclei these jets should loose about @xmath12gev  @xcite , where @xmath13 is the radius of the nuclei .",
    "therefore , hadrons with @xmath14 gev produced from these jets will be largely suppressed , as it seen in the figure  [ fig.2 ] .",
    "3 .   on the other hand",
    ", mini - jet fragmentation into final state hadrons can also occur before the jet leaves the nuclei volume .",
    "the produced particles have to wade out through the nuclei , being affected by multiple rescatterings , and thus their distribution ( blue dash - dot line in figures [ fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] ) becomes more close to the exponent , resulting in higher values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the power - law term , and dominates the mid-@xmath0 region .",
    "this process ca nt be described in pqcd , however .",
    "now one can notice the hierarchy in hadroproduction dynamics by complexity ( number of involved partons or initial size ) of the colliding system :    * @xmath17 collisions : a point like interaction that can be described in terms of pqcd and thus , need a power - law term only in its spectrum .",
    "* baryon - baryon collision : in addition to the mini - jet fragmentation of the virtual partons an exponential term standing for the release of thermalized particles due to preexisting quarks and gluons is added . therefore , one gets a sum of exponential and power - law terms to describe the spectra in @xmath6-collisions . *",
    "heavy - ion collision : due to the quenching of charged hadrons inside the nuclei the power - law term splits into two distributions with different parameters ( the second closer to the exponent ) .",
    "therefore , we need a sum of exponential and * 2 * power - law terms to describe the spectra .",
    "though , the parameterisation using an exponential and two power - law terms  ( [ eq : expplpl ] ) gives a rather perfect description of the experimental data  @xcite ( figure  [ fig.1 ] c ) , it is known that boltzmann thermodynamics is not applicable for heavy - ion collisions . when a large colliding system is formed",
    ", one should also take effects of the collective motion into account  @xcite .",
    "thus , in heavy - ion collisions the multiparticle production is usually considered in terms of relativistic hydrodynamics , contrary to widely used thermodynamic approaches  @xcite for @xmath6 , @xmath18 and @xmath5-collisions .",
    "therefore , it is suggested to modify the introduced approach  ( [ eq : exppl ] ) using recent theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "the idea of hydrodynamic approach is that the thermalized system expands collectively in longitudinal direction generating the transverse flow by the high pressure in the colliding system .",
    "according to this approach the radiation of thermalized particles can be parameterized by the following formula : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 standing for the surface velocity . in this analysis",
    "we take @xmath23 which is consistent with previous observations  @xcite .",
    "thus , one have to substitute the exponential term in  ( [ eq : exppl ] ) by  ( [ eq : bessel ] ) .",
    "note , that the power - law term in  ( [ eq : exppl ] ) stands for the point - like pqcd interactions that occur in the early stage of the collision , with the hadrons produced from the mini - jet fragmentation leave the interaction area before reaching the thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , we assume this term to be considered without taking the collective motion into account .    now one can use this hydrodynamic approach to fit the recent experimental data on lead - lead collisions measured by the alice collaboration  @xcite at @xmath24tev .",
    "+ these data are shown in figure  [ fig.3 ] together with the fit : +    @xmath25    note , that the proposed hydrodynamic extension ( [ eq : besselplpl ] ) of ( [ eq : exppl ] ) only slightly modifies the description of the experimental data and still two power - law terms are needed",
    ". however , the values of the parameter @xmath26 extracted from parameterizations ( [ eq : expplpl ] ) and ( [ eq : besselplpl ] ) differ significantly with one in @xcite . ] .",
    "the introduced approach ( [ eq : besselplpl ] ) allows to extract the thermalized production ( described by function  ( [ eq : bessel ] ) ) of charged hadrons from the whole statistical ensemble . in this paper",
    "it is proposed to study the variations of the temperature - like parameter @xmath27 in ( [ eq : bessel ] ) with the centrality and the c.m.s .",
    "energy in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to consider the experimental data measured at rhic and lhc together .    since the centre - of - mass energies per nucleon in these experiments are varied by a factor of @xmath28 , a unified approach considering the energy density is suggested .",
    "the energy density in heavy - ion interactions is known to depend not only on the centre - of - mass energy , but also on the centrality of the collision .",
    "hence , while the maximum energy densities that can be reached at rhic and at lhc differ significantly , the energy density in central collisions at rhic might be of the same order with that in peripheral collisions at lhc .",
    "in this paper we consider the experimental data measured in auau collisions at @xmath29 gev / n and @xmath30 gev / n by phenix  @xcite and pbpb collisions at @xmath31 tev / n by alice  @xcite",
    ".    the energy density @xmath32 for central collisions can be determined from the experimental data by the formula  @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the energy density averaged over the transverse area , and @xmath35 is the nuclear radius .",
    "however , for non - central collisions it is more convenient to estimate it using a simple parameterization  @xcite : @xmath36 with @xmath37 calculated for the most central collisions , @xmath38  @xcite , @xmath39  @xcite and @xmath40 gev  @xcite . here",
    "the second factor is responsible for the incident energy dependence , @xmath41 is the c.m.s collision energy , and the third one shows the dependence on the number of binary parton - parton collisions @xmath42 which is related to the centrality of the collision .",
    "note , that in this analysis @xmath37 turned out to be the same for phenix and alice data , thus confirming the @xmath43 value proposed in @xcite .",
    "having calculated the energy density @xmath32 using the formula  ( [ eq : ed ] ) , one can plot the temperature @xmath27 extracted from ( [ eq : besselplpl ] ) as a function of it , as shown in figure  [ fig.4 ] .",
    "first of all , as it was expected , the energy density obtained in central collisions at rhic is similar to those in peripheral collisions at lhc , and , remarkably , a smooth transition in the @xmath27 values between these three measurements is also observed .",
    "note , that as one could naively expect , the value of @xmath27 ( as well as @xmath10 and @xmath44 of the power - law term in ( [ eq : besselplpl ] ) ) for peripheral lead - lead collisions turns out to be practically identical with that obtained for @xmath6-collisions at the same c.m.s .",
    "energy  @xcite .",
    "next , one can notice rather interesting behavior of the temperature @xmath27 as a function of energy density ( @xmath45 ) , which is in a good agreement with the bag model  @xcite , with @xmath46 gev/@xmath47 , as determined from the fit in figure  [ fig.4 ] .",
    "another remarkable observation on the temperature @xmath27 of the final state particles is that for high energy densities it reaches a certain limit .",
    "this might be explained from qgp theory that considers the phase transition temperature @xmath48 from qgp to final state hadrons : the expanding system cools down until it reaches the freeze - out stage , thus , the temperature of the final state particles should be always below @xmath48 . indeed , for high values of @xmath32 one can notice , that the observed freeze - out temperature is @xmath49 mev , and ( as one can expect ) is slightly below the critical temperature @xmath50 mev for qgp obtained in different calculations  @xcite .",
    "the spectra of charged hadron production in heavy - ion collisions have been compared with those measured in @xmath6 and @xmath5 interactions using the recently introduced two component model .",
    "the observed hierarchy on the size of the colliding system has been discussed and the qualitative picture for hadroproduction in heavy - ion collisions explaining the peculiar shape of nuclear modification factor , @xmath9 , has been introduced .",
    "next , the hydrodynamic extension of this parameterization accounting for the collective motion in heavy - ion collisions was suggested .",
    "this approach allowed to extract the thermalized production of charged hadrons from the whole statistical ensemble and to study it separately .",
    "thus , the variations of the temperature of the final state hadrons coming from the thermalized part of the spectra have been studied as a function of energy density using both rhic and lhc data and the behavior that might be explained in terms of qgp formation has been observed .",
