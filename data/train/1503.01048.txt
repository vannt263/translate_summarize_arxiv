    "we begin with some basic definitions in the areas of both graph reconstruction and the swappability of graphs . for the extent of this writing ,",
    "all graphs introduced are understood to be finite , simple , and connected unless explicitely stated otherwise .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph , and let @xmath4 .",
    "then the unlabeled graph @xmath5 is said to be an * edge - card * of @xmath0 .",
    "the multiset of all such edge - cards of @xmath0 is called the * edge - deck * of @xmath0 , and is written @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 .",
    "a * blocker * of @xmath8 is a graph @xmath9 such that @xmath10 .",
    "if no such graph @xmath11 exists , then @xmath0 is said to be * reconstructable * from @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph such that @xmath0 is reconstructable from @xmath6 .",
    "then the * edge reconstruction number * of @xmath0 , noted @xmath1 , is the size of the smallest @xmath7 such that @xmath0 is reconstructable from @xmath8 .",
    "froncek , hlavacek , and rosenberg @xcite define @xmath12-swappability as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph and let @xmath12 be a positive integer .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is * @xmath12-swappable * if @xmath13 , there exists @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .    the smallest such @xmath12 is called the * swapping number * of @xmath0 .",
    "if no such number exists , the swapping number of @xmath0 is said to be infinity .    it is worth noting that in the context of regular graphs , there can be no individually replaceable edges .",
    "thus , if a regular graph is finitely swappable , the size of the swapping sets for any edge is at least 2 .",
    "originally published in k.j . asciak",
    "s master s thesis at the university of malta in 1999 , the following conjecture was republished in a recent ( 2010 ) survey regarding open questions in reconstruction numbers @xcite .",
    "[ conj ] if @xmath0 is an @xmath2 regular graph , then @xmath19 .",
    "while exploring the possibility of this conjecture , we found the following relation between 2-swappability and @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath0 is a graph with @xmath20 , then @xmath0 is @xmath21-swappable .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph , and suppose @xmath20",
    ". then @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , there is a graph that blocks @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath4 , and let @xmath24 .",
    "then there must exist some blocker @xmath11 such that @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , there exist distinct @xmath26 such that :    @xmath27    @xmath28    this implies there is some @xmath29 so that @xmath30 . by substituting the left hand side of this expression for @xmath11 in",
    "we see that wlog there must be some @xmath31 so that @xmath32 [ see remark below ] , and thus there must exist @xmath33 so that @xmath34 . since @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , then @xmath37 .",
    "thus , for every edge @xmath4 , there exists @xmath38 and @xmath36 so that if the former edges are replaced with the latter , we get a graph isomorphic to the original .",
    "i.e. @xmath0 is @xmath21-swappable .    if @xmath39 , there exist 2 distinct edges of @xmath11 that make suitable choices for @xmath40 .",
    "we choose the one that is not @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , this makes a fair bit of sense .",
    "one would expect graphs with high edge reconstruction numbers and graphs that are finitely swappable to both have a relatively high level of symmetry .",
    "and so it turned out that 2-swappability was a necessary condition for a graph to have an edge reconstruction number higher than two .",
    "then , what could be said of sufficient conditions ? for this , we examined graphs with the highest level of symmetry .",
    "namely , those for which all edges are removal similar .",
    "( i.e. all of their edge cards are isomorphic . ) in regular graphs , that line of questioning gave us the following result .",
    "if @xmath0 is a regular , 2-swappable graph for which all edges are removal similar , then @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a regular , 2-swappable graph , for which all edges are removal similar .",
    "let @xmath4 .",
    "then there exist @xmath24 and @xmath42 so that @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 . since @xmath0 is regular , @xmath9 .",
    "however , @xmath45 .",
    "further , @xmath46 for some @xmath47 .",
    "thus , @xmath48 .",
    "let @xmath7 with @xmath49 .",
    "since all edges of @xmath0 are removal similar , @xmath50 therefore , @xmath0 is not reconstructable from @xmath8 .",
    "so , @xmath20 .",
    "finally we arrived at the most important question : `` do such graphs even exist ? ''",
    "if so , the conjecture we were examining would be false .",
    "but as 2-swappable graphs had never been studied before , it was not known ; that is , until we discovered a wonderfully simple example , the standard 3 dimensional cube .",

    "let @xmath53 .",
    "then there exist @xmath54 such that @xmath55 , and @xmath56 .",

    "then there exist @xmath74 such that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "then , @xmath57 by a near - identity mapping that swaps @xmath58 with @xmath59 , ( which are in the same bipartite set ) and maps all other vertices to themselves .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is 2-swappable    if @xmath77 , where @xmath11 is a hamiltonian cycle , and @xmath78 then @xmath0 is 2-swappable .",

    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "then , @xmath67 is a hamiltonian cycle in @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is 2-swappable .",
    "for each of the following graphs @xmath0 , @xmath20 .    1 .",
    "@xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a perfect matching , 2 .",
    "@xmath60 where @xmath11 is a hamiltonian cycle , 3 .",
    "@xmath72 , where @xmath52 is a perfect matching , 4 .",
    "@xmath77 , where @xmath11 is a hamiltonian cycle .",
    "all of the above graphs are regular and 2-swappable .",
    "they are also all edge transitive , and thus all of their edges are respectively removal similar .",
    "thus , we have not only demonstrated that there are indeed @xmath82 regular graphs with an edge reconstruction number that is greater than 2 , but also done much of the ground work linking the topics of edge reconstruction and the swappability of graphs .",
    "the hope is that these results can be leveraged to provide insight into both areas in the future .",
    "the framework of swappability as applied to edge reconstruction provides a number of potential leads for getting more edge reconstruction results . and so , we present the following questions and ideas .",
    "currently , the only regular , connected , 2-swappable graphs known are cycles , and those 4 families presented in this paper .",
    "all of these are edge transitive , and thus all have an edge reconstruction number greater than 2 .",
    "all we have done here is give a lower bound for the edge reconstruction number of these graphs .",
    "but what is their @xmath83 exactly ?",
    "it is known that this number is bounded above as a function of the regularity of the graph ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "but since our results refuted the conjecure that this number was bounded above by 2 , the following questions must be asked .",
    "we believe this to be possible , and it would be something along the lines of for every pairing of edge - cards , it must be possible to swap 2 edges of those respective types with 2 edges from the complement . giving a sort of `` full 2-swappability '' .",
    "we have played with this idea a bit , and the results seem promising ."
