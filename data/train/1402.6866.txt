    "the problem of summation of random variables is one of the most important fields of probability theory .",
    "the classical result states that if @xmath14 are two independent random variables with given distributions , then the distribution of their sum @xmath15 is given by the convolution of their distributions . clearly , this result is also valid for the sum of arbitrary finite number of independent random variables .",
    "the same concerns independent stochastic processes .",
    "if @xmath16 are two independent stochastic processes with given distributions ( that is , if for any @xmath17 the random variables @xmath18 are independent ) then the distribution of their sum @xmath19 is given by the convolution of their distributions for any fixed @xmath10 .    while the convolution operation solves the problem of desribing the distribution of the sum of two independent stochastic processes , in practice it is almost useless when the distributions of these processes have non - trivial forms .",
    "except the case of exponential - type distributions , the evaluation of such convolutions is a very difficult and often impracticable problem .",
    "that is why those cases ( very rare indeed ) , when the distribution of the sum of two processes with non - trivial distributions can be obtained in an explicit form , look like a miracle and excite great interest .    in the present article",
    "we examine this problem when @xmath20 are two independent goldstein - kac telegraph processes developing with some constant speed and driven by two independent poisson processes of the same rate .",
    "this subject is motivated by the great theoretical importance and numerous fruitful applications of the telegraph processes in physics , biology , transport phenomena , financial modelling and other fields .",
    "another motivation has a more general mathematical character .",
    "let we have two functions @xmath21 ( classical or generalized ) and suppose that each of them is a solution ( partial or fundamental ) to respective partial differential equation ( the same or different ones ) .",
    "let @xmath22 be the convolution ( in @xmath23 ) of these functions .",
    "what is the differential equation solved by function @xmath24 ? in the case",
    "when @xmath25 are the probability densities of two independent stochastic processes , this question can be treated as the problem of obtaining a partial differential equation for the density of the sum of these processes for arbitrary fixed @xmath10 . despite great importance of such a problem for probability theory , analysis and mathematical physics , it is not solved so far .",
    "even the order of such equation is unknown .",
    "our analysis throws some light upon this problem for the case when @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the densities of two independent goldstein - kac telegraph processes .",
    "the classical telegraph process @xmath28 is performed by the stochastic motion of a particle that moves on the real line @xmath2 at some constant finite speed @xmath29 and alternates two possible directions of motion ( forward and backward ) at poisson - distributed random instants of intensity @xmath6 .",
    "such random walk was first introduced in the works of goldstein @xcite and kac @xcite ( of which the latter is a reprinting of an earlier 1956 article ) .",
    "the most remarkable fact is that the transition density of @xmath28 is the fundamental solution to the hyperbolic telegraph equation ( which is one of the classical equations of mathematical physics ) .",
    "moreover , under increasing @xmath29 and @xmath30 , it transforms into the transition density of the standard brownian motion on @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the telegraph process can be treated as a finite - velocity counterpart of the one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "the telegraph process @xmath28 can also be treated in a more general context of random evolutions ( see @xcite ) .    during last decades the goldstein - kac telegraph process and",
    "its numerous generalizations have become the subject of extensive researches .",
    "some properties of the solution space of the goldstein - kac telegraph equation were studied by bartlett @xcite .",
    "the process of one - dimensional random motion at finite speed governed by a poisson process with a time - dependent parameter was considered by kaplan @xcite .",
    "the relationships between the goldstein - kac model and physical processes , including some emerging effects of the relativity theory , were thoroughly examined by bartlett @xcite , cane @xcite .",
    "formulas for the distributions of the first - exit time from a given interval and of the maximum displacement of the telegraph process were obtained by pinsky ( * ? ? ? * section 0.5 ) , foong @xcite , masoliver and weiss @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the telegraph process with absorbing and reflecting barriers was examined by foong and kanno @xcite , ratanov @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional stochastic motion with an arbitrary number of velocities and governing poisson processes was examined by kolesnik @xcite .",
    "the telegraph processes with random velocities were studied by stadje and zacks @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the telegraph - type evolutions in inhomogeneous environments were considered by ratanov @xcite",
    ". a detailed analysis of the moment function of the telegraph process was done by kolesnik @xcite .",
    "probabilistic methods of solving the cauchy problems for the telegraph equation were developed by kac @xcite , kisynski @xcite , kabanov @xcite , turbin and samoilenko @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the goldstein - kac model for the case of a damped telegraph process with logistic stationary distributions was given by di crescenzo and martinucci @xcite .",
    "a random motion with velocities alternating at erlang - distributed random times was studied by di crescenzo @xcite .",
    "formulas for the occupation time distributions of the telegraph process were obtained by bogachev and ratanov @xcite .",
    "the explicit probability distribution of the euclidean distance between two independent telegraph processes with arbitrary parameters was obtained by kolesnik @xcite .",
    "the most important properties of the telegraph processes and their applications to financial modelling were presented in the recently published book by kolesnik and ratanov @xcite .    to the best of author s knowledge , despite the great variety of works on the telegraph processes , the probability laws for their linear combinations were not studied in the literature so far . in the present article we take the first step in this important field and examine the sum @xmath9 of two independent goldstein - kac telegraph processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , both with the same parameters @xmath31 , that , at the initial time instant @xmath4 , simultaneously start from the origin @xmath5 of the real line @xmath2 . despite a fairly complicated form of their densities involving modified bessel functions , one managed to obtain the transition density and the probability distribution function of @xmath32 in an explicit form . to avoid the convolution operation which is practically useless in this case ,",
    "we apply the characteristic functions technique leading to fourier and inverse fourier transforms combined with some important properties of bessel and hypergeometric functions .",
    "we also prove that the density of @xmath32 satisfies a third - order hyperbolic partial differential equation with an operator representing a product of the telegraph operator and shifted time differential operator .",
    "some remarks on the more general case of arbitrary parameters and start points are also given .",
    "the telegraph stochastic process is performed by a particle that starts at the initial time instant @xmath4 from the origin @xmath5 of the real line @xmath2 and moves with some finite constant speed @xmath29 .",
    "the initial direction of the motion ( positive or negative ) is taken on with equal probabilities 1/2 .",
    "the motion is driven by a homogeneous poisson process of rate @xmath6 as follows .",
    "as a poisson event occurs , the particle instantaneously takes on the opposite direction and keeps moving with the same speed @xmath29 until the next poisson event occurs , then it takes on the opposite direction again independently of its previous motion , and so on .",
    "this random motion has first been studied by goldstein @xcite and kac @xcite and was called the _ telegraph process _ afterwards .",
    "let @xmath28 denote the particle s position on @xmath2 at time @xmath10 .",
    "since the speed @xmath29 is finite , then , at arbitrary time instant @xmath10 , the distribution @xmath33 is concentrated in the close interval @xmath34 $ ] which is the support of this distribution .",
    "the density @xmath35 of the distribution @xmath36 has the structure @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the densities of the singular ( with respect to the lebesgue measure on the line ) and of the absolutely continuous components of the distribution of @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the singular component of the distribution is , obviously , concentrated at two terminal points @xmath40 of the interval @xmath34 $ ] and corresponds to the case when no one poisson event occurs till the time moment @xmath41 and , therefore , the particle does not change its initial direction . therefore , the probability of being at arbitrary time instant @xmath10 at the terminal points @xmath40 is @xmath42 the absolutely continuous component of the distribution of @xmath28 is concentrated in the open interval @xmath43 and corresponds to the case when at least one poisson event occurs by the moment @xmath41 and , therefore , the particle changes its initial direction .",
