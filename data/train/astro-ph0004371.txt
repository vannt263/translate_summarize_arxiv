    "this paper describes two ongoing observational programs at keck unified by a common goal : to investigate the metallicity , structure , and dynamics of m31 s extended stellar halo .",
    "the first is a low - resolution spectroscopic survey of field red giant stars in m31 s outer halo ( @xmath4@xmath550  kpc ) , while the second aims to combine low- , intermediate- , and high - resolution spectroscopy of giants in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) companions of m31 located at @xmath6@xmath5300  kpc .",
    "such dwarfs have long been thought of as basic building blocks in the process of galaxy formation .",
    "the metallicity distribution of our target stars serves as as a fossil record of the formation of m31 s halo .",
    "moreover , these stars are good tracers for investigating the internal dynamics of the dwarfs as well as the global dynamics of the m31 subgroup , and hence the dark matter distribution within the local group .",
    "the radial abundance gradient and abundance spread in m31 s stellar halo can potentially discriminate between competing galaxy formation models .",
    "the dissipational collapse model@xcite predicts a strong radial metallicity gradient , whereas the accretion model@xcite predicts no strong gradient .",
    "it is important to study both globular cluster and field star populations since they may be dynamically distinct from each other .",
    "the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) provides a global external perspective of a large spiral much like our own , and yet is close enough for individual stars to be resolved . ref",
    ".   shows evidence for a weak metallicity gradient in a sample of 150  m31 globular clusters , with a mean iron abundance of @xmath7=-1.2 $ ] , which is slightly higher than the mean value of @xmath7=-1.4 $ ] for galactic globular clusters .",
    "the metallicity of m31 field halo stars remains uncertain even after a decade or more of concerted effort using ground - based telescopes .",
    "ref .   found a metallicity of @xmath7\\approx-0.6 $ ] for stars located at a projected distance of @xmath8  kpc along the minor axis and ref .",

    "( _ hst _ ) studies have used its excellent angular resolution to separate field stars from background galaxies and find the mean metallicity at various points in the m31 spheroid to be comparable to that of 47  tuc : @xmath7\\sim-0.7$]@xcite .",
    "the ground - based studies are hindered to one degree or another by sample contamination by distant background field galaxies many of which are compact enough to be mistaken for stars at faint magnitudes .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "studies , on the other hand , are limited by a small field of view and the lack of comparison field control samples .",
    "studies of the inner halo risk possible contamination by m31 disk stars , while those of the sparse outer halo have to contend with a significant fraction of foreground contaminants , milky way dwarf stars at m31 s low galactic latitude . in general ,",
    "sample contamination makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the average [ fe / h ] of m31 s stellar halo and especially its [ fe / h ] spread .",
    "our study is based on deep @xmath1 images , obtained with the kpno 4-meter telescope , of a @xmath12 field at @xmath0  kpc ( @xmath13 ) on m31 s se minor axis .",
    "this field is further out on the minor axis than the ones used in previous studies , probes at least as far out into the m31 spheroid as the others ( based on a 2:1 flattened spheroid ) , and is the least susceptible to contamination by the m31 disk .",
    "observations of a well - matched comparison field , well away from m31 but at a comparable galactic latitude , serve as a control data set .",
    "four high resolution @xmath14-band images obtained with keck , covering most of the field , provide morphological information .",
    "the stars in these fields ( m31 giants and milky way dwarfs ) are outnumbered by the dense background of distant faint blue field galaxies , many of which are too compact to be distinguished from stars on the basis of image morphology alone ( even with keck s @xmath15@xmath16 seeing ) .",
    "we use an alternative method developed in ref .   for discriminating between stars and faint galaxies , one that uses broadband @xmath1 color information in addition to morphological information .",
    "the technique relies on the fact that stars , even those spanning a wide range of age and metallicity , occupy a narrow , well - defined locus in multicolor space whereas galaxies display a broad distribution due to their mix of stellar populations and redshifts . for an object to be identified as a stellar candidate",
    ", its intensity profile must be consistent with the psf _ and _ its @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 colors must be consistent ( within errors ) with the stellar locus defined by model isochrones@xcite and empirical data on galactic globular cluster giants .",
    "this morphological and @xmath1 color - based screening is done on all objects detected in the m31 halo and comparison fields .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of surviving objects in the comparison field is well described by a superposition of foreground galactic dwarf stars ( in keeping with a standard empirical model of the galaxy ) against a backdrop of residual contaminating faint blue field galaxies , while the m31 halo field contains a clear excess of faint red objects ( @xmath20@xmath523 , @xmath21@xmath53.5 ) in addition to these two components .",
    "the location of this population of faint red objects in the cmd is consistent with what one would expect for red giant stars at the distance of m31 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we have carried out a statistical subtraction between the m31 halo field and comparison field cmds .",
    "a detailed description of the selection process and results is given in ref .  .",
    "-2.25truecm      of the @xmath1- and morphology - selected sample of objects in our @xmath0  kpc minor axis field , the brightest ones ( @xmath22 ) serve as excellent targets for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "spectra of 99  m31 halo red giant candidates have been obtained with the 10-meter keck telescope and low - resolution imaging spectrometer@xcite ( lris ) around the ca  ii triplet ( @xmath238700 ) .",
    "in addition , spectra have been obtained of 12  control objects which are known to be significantly brighter than the tip of m31 s red giant branch , and which are thus likely to be foreground galactic dwarf stars .",
    "five multislit masks were observed for @xmath24  hr each during 4  nights in the fall 1996 and 1997 observing seasons , with @xmath25@xmath525  objects per mask .",
    "the observations used a 1200  lines  mm@xmath26 grating and @xmath27-wide slitlets , for a dispersion of 0.62  pixel@xmath26 and resolution of @xmath28  km  s@xmath26 over the spectral range of 75009000@xmath29 .",
    "the radial velocity of each target object is determined from its spectrum using standard cross - correlation techniques .",
    "this kinematic information is useful for distinguishing among m31 halo giants , m31 disk giants , foreground galactic dwarfs , and distant background galaxies .",
    "most of the foreground contamination in this low galactic latitude m31 field ( @xmath30 ) is expected to be due to dwarf stars in the milky way s disk with heliocentric velocities close to zero , significantly displaced from m31 s systemic velocity of @xmath31  km  s@xmath26 .",
    "m31 halo red giants are expected to have a large spread of radial velocities due to their random motion in the galaxy s potential , while m31 disk giants are expected to cluster tightly around its systemic velocity ( the line - of - sight component of the disk rotation velocity is expected to be zero as our field is on the minor axis ) .",
    "in addition to the removal of residual contaminants , spectroscopy allows direct measurement of the metallicity of each star using the near infrared ca  ii absorption line strengths , @xmath32 ( sum of the three equivalent widths ) .",
    "there has been a lot of work to develop calibration relations based on observations of the line strengths of red giants in fiducial galactic star clusters with known metallicities@xcite .",
    "such relations connect @xmath32 and the brightness of the star @xmath33 relative to the horizontal branch to [ fe / h ] , and have been calibrated over the range @xmath34\\leq0.0 $ ] .",
    "the line strength , @xmath32 , of each of our m31 halo red giant candidates is determined using an empirical linear relation between the relative strength of the cross correlation peak and the directly - measured , but somewhat noisier statistic @xmath32 for selected stars .",
    "this derived @xmath32 is then used to calculate the metallicity of each object .",
    "a detailed description is given in ref .  .",
    "the surface density of red giant candidates in the @xmath0  kpc m31 halo field , as derived from the statistically - subtracted , @xmath1 color- and morphologically - selected sample , is coupled with the _ hst _ studies in ref .  .",
    "the data indicate that m31 s stellar halo is much denser and/or larger than that of the galaxy :",
    "@xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ratio of the radial scale lengths of m31 and the galaxy and @xmath37 is the assumed power law index of the density profile@xcite .",
    "the density of m31 s inner halo may be even higher than this estimate : while we have adopted a single power law profile for m31 s halo , the outer profile is known to steepen both from the counts in our @xmath0  kpc field and from ref .   which finds that the profile is better fit by a de  vaucouleurs law than a power law . a refined estimate of the halo density profile and flattening",
    "are underway based on a spectroscopically - selected sample of an additional 50100  secure m31 halo red giants at various locations on the major and minor axes .",
    "radial velocities and line strengths derived from this sample should enhance our knowledge of the dynamics and metallicity of m31 s halo , respectively ( see sec .",
    "2.4.2 and 2.4.3 below ) .",
    "the radial velocities measured from the @xmath38 keck spectra presented in this paper display a bimodal distribution with one component centered on m31 s systemic velocity ( @xmath39  km  s@xmath26 ) and another component centered at @xmath40  km  s@xmath26 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "we use an empirical star count model of the galaxy ( iasg model)@xcite to estimate the expected distribution of line - of - sight velocities of foreground dwarfs .",
    "the spectroscopic control sample consists of 12  stars with @xmath41 , which is brighter than @xmath42 at the distance of m31 ( fig .",
    "1 ) ; these stars are thus exclusively foreground dwarfs .",
    "the iasg model matches their velocity distribution very well ( dotted histogram in fig .  2 ) .",
    "a linear combination of the iasg model @xmath43 distribution and a gaussian centered on m31 s systemic velocity is fit to the data ; the best fit gaussian width is @xmath44  km  s@xmath26 and the fraction of m31 halo stars in the sample of 99 targets is estimated to be @xmath45 .",
    "note , with this normalization of the galactic dwarf @xmath43 distribution ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , almost all the stars with @xmath46  km  s@xmath26 are likely to be foreground dwarfs . the model results may be used to estimate the foreground contamination fraction for various velocity cuts in the sample  e.g .",
    ",  @xmath47  km  s@xmath26 corresponds to @xmath4850% contamination in all velocity bins , while @xmath49  km  s@xmath26 corresponds to @xmath5025% contamination .",
    "the different symbols in the cmd plot ( fig .  1 ) are based on these velocity ranges .",
    "the lack of a significant concentration of objects at the exact systemic velocity indicates a negligibly small degree of contamination by m31 disk giants .",
    "selecting stars with @xmath49  km  s@xmath26 yields a secure sample of m31 halo red giant stars .",
    "6.3truecm      the secure sample of m31 halo red giant stars with @xmath49  km  s@xmath26 is particularly useful for investigating the mean [ fe / h ] and spread .",
    "the iron abundance of each of these stars is measured using two independent methods : the star s location in the @xmath51 vs.  @xmath14 cmd and the strength of the ca  ii absorption lines , @xmath32 .",
    "the cmd - based photometric method compares each star to model isochrones calculated over a range of metallicities@xcite .",
    "the line strength @xmath32 is calibrated to [ fe / h ] using two independent calibration relations@xcite , labeled `` zw '' and `` cg97 '' , respectively , following the designation in ref .  .",
    "the photometric estimate of [ fe / h ] is in reasonable agreement with the spectroscopic estimates within the calibrated range of each method , especially for the cg97 calibration ( fig .",
    "measuring the abundance gradient versus radius in m31 s halo involves comparison of the mean [ fe / h ] in our data set to _ hst_-based photometric determinations of [ fe / h ] at @xmath8 and 11  kpc on the minor axis@xcite and at @xmath52  kpc on the major axis@xcite .",
    "both of our @xmath0  kpc samples of halo red giants , the large @xmath1- and morphologically - selected statistically - subtracted sample and the smaller but cleaner spectroscopically - selected secure sample , yield @xmath53\\rangle$ ] in the vicinity of @xmath54 to @xmath55 using various ways to estimate [ fe / h ] ( photometric and spectroscopic ) .",
    "this mean abundance is roughly consistent with the results of the _ hst _ studies indicating that m31 lacks a strong radial gradient in metallicity .",
    "however , the use of heterogeneous samples , different [ fe / h ] determination methods , and possible sample contamination ( m31 disk stars ) in the inner halo fields , makes this conclusion uncertain .",
    "we are in the process of isolating clean samples of halo red giants at a variety of radii in m31 and determining [ fe / h ] in a uniform way with the help of keck lris spectra ( sec .",
    "2.4.1 ) .",
    "the secure sample of m31 halo red giants in the @xmath0  kpc field displays a large spread in [ fe / h ] ( @xmath56  dex ) , independent of the metallicity measurement method ( upper panels of fig .",
    "the metallicity distribution among m31 field halo stars is similar to the distribution of mean [ fe / h ] values of m31 globular clusters and local group dwarf satellite galaxies ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "the observed [ fe / h ] distribution in m31 s halo can be explained in terms of chemical enrichment models with steady gas loss from the system ( see details in ref .  ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies , the most numerous type of galaxy , are considered to be major building blocks for the formation and evolution of more massive galaxies@xcite . among dwarf galaxies ,",
    "the least luminous , least massive morphological type known is the dwarf spheroidal subclass .",
    "almost all known dsphs are found in close proximity to more massive galaxies , and are therefore particularly useful as tracers of the gravitational potential of the `` parent '' galaxy as well as for the study of environmental effects on dwarf galaxy evolution .",
    "while the nine dsph companions of the milky way have been studied in great detail , similar studies of the m31 dsphs have only recently become feasible thanks to large - aperture 810-meter class telescopes and efficient modern - day spectrographs@xcite .",
    "large area surveys in search of low surface brightness objects have led to the discovery of three new m31 dsph galaxies in the last couple of years@xcite , bringing the census to six dsph galaxies .",
    "the present set of m31 dsph galaxies cover the same range of galactocentric distances as the milky way companions .",
    "thus it should be possible to make a direct comparison of environmental effects on these two sets of dsphs .",
    "we present initial results from a keck spectroscopic survey of five of the six m31 dsph companions , andi , andiii , andv , andvi , and andvii .",
    "the first four have been studied with lris using a similar multislit ca  ii triplet setup as for our m31 field halo star survey ( sec .",
    "2.3 ) ; the fifth dsph has been observed with the high - resolution echelle spectrometer@xcite ( hires)see sec .",
    "3.2.4 below .        integrated stellar velocities of the five m31 dsph companions are listed in table  1 . in each case , this is based on the mean radial velocity of 1525  member giants .",
    "the quoted uncertainty is the @xmath57 error of the mean , derived from the observed rms dispersion of velocities among member stars ( combination of measurement error and internal velocity dispersion ) ; it does _ not _ include possible systematic error in the measurements .",
    "note , the signal - to - noise ratio of the andiii data is substantially lower than that of the other dsphs and this is due to truncation of the exposure time .",

    "the hi cloud tentatively detected in the vicinity of andiii has a radial velocity of @xmath64  km  s@xmath26 in the radio 21 cm line , which is within @xmath57 of the optical velocity measurement .",
    "if this low significance hi detection at andiii is confirmed , it likely represents gas that is physically associated with the dsph .",
    "by contrast , the 21 cm velocity of the hvc  368 cloud in the direction of andv is @xmath65 and this is clearly inconsistent with the optical value . as",
    "originally suspected@xcite , this cloud is likely to be a fragment of a larger neighboring gas cloud ( complex ` h ' ) that happens to be superposed on andv .",
    "figure  5 shows cmds of four of the m31 dsphs , the ones we have targeted for lris spectroscopy ( targets marked by special symbols ) .",
    "the slope and width of the red giant branch traced by member stars are indicative of the mean metallicity and metallicity spread of the dsph , respectively .",
    "for example , the andv red giant branch is significantly closer to vertical than andi s or andvi s indicating a lower metallicity .",
    "this is confirmed by the spectroscopic [ fe / h ] estimates@xcite for these galaxies ( see fig .",
    "2.5truecm    perhaps an even more striking aspect of fig .",
    "5 is the variation of the _ width _ of the red giant branch from one dsph to another .",
    "it is convenient to compare andv to andvi since their cmds are based on photometric data of near - identical quality : short @xmath66 and @xmath14 band exposures with lris in @xmath67@xmath16 seeing conditions@xcite . while the andv member giants define a very narrow track , the andvi members display a substantial spread in color that is significantly in excess of the photometric error ; this is most easily explained in terms of a metallicity spread in andvi . the spectroscopically - determined [ fe / h ] histograms ( fig",
    ".  6 ) support this hypothesis : despite the fact that it has the highest signal - to - noise spectra of the four , the andvi histogram shows a prominent tail towards high metallicity and a spread in excess of 1.5  dex . similarly , the andi red giant branch is broader than that of andiii ( fig .  5 ) , perhaps due to an intrinsic metallicity spread in the former galaxy .",
    "the large spread in spectroscopic [ fe / h ] values observed for andiii ( fig .",
    "6 ) is likely a result of measurement error caused by the low signal - to - noise ratio of its spectra .",
    "dwarf companions can be treated as test particles in a large galaxy s gravitational potential .",
    "ref .   presents the most up - to - date and thorough dynamical analysis of the m31 halo using available radial velocity and distance data for several classes of tracers : gas and stars in the rotating disk , globular clusters , planetary nebulae , and dwarf satellites .",
    "the recent discovery of distant dsphs around m31 , some almost 300  kpc from the parent galaxy , has breathed new life into this subject .",
    "the most distant tracers provide the best constraints on the total mass of the halo .",
    "an update of the m31 dynamical analysis , including radial velocity data for all of the dsphs presented in this paper@xcite , yields the best total mass estimate to date : @xmath68 .",
    "surprisingly , this m31 value is somewhat lower than the best estimate for the total mass of the milky way halo .",
    "however , the large uncertainty associated with each determination means that one can not rule out the possibility that the two galaxies have the same mass .",
    "the hires observations of andvii red giants presented in this paper were carried out in an unusual manner .",
    "special purpose multislit masks were designed and fabricated to enable simultaneous observations of multiple red giants .",
    "each mask contains 56 slitlets , with lengths in the range @xmath27 to @xmath69 , so that the sum total of all slitlet lengths is @xmath70 in order to prevent overlap of adjacent echelle orders .",
    "needless to say , there is not much blank `` sky '' area available on the typical slitlet . instead of the usual method of sky subtraction",
    ", we synthesize a single sky spectrum for each multislit mask by coadding blank pixels from all the slitlets on that mask .",
    "the experiment was made doubly difficult by the fact that our typical target star is very faint by hires standards : @xmath7123 .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to reliably extract velocities for most of the 21  stars ( fig .",
    "the observed rms dispersion is @xmath72  km  s@xmath26 , quadrature sum of the dsph s internal velocity dispersion and the velocity measurement error .",
    "these data are being used to probe the dynamics and mass - to - light ratio of andvii@xcite .",
    "* a new color - based screening technique , using deep @xmath1 photometry obtained with the kpno 4-meter telescope , is combined with traditional morphological star - galaxy separation based on high resolution @xmath14-band images obtained with the keck 10-meter / lris .",

    "<S> we present keck 10-meter / lris spectra of candidate red giants in the halo of m31 , located at a projected radius of @xmath0  kpc on the minor axis . </S>",
    "<S> these spectroscopic targets have been selected using a combination of @xmath1-based and morphological screening to eliminate background galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> radial velocity measurements are used to separate m31 halo giants from foreground milky way dwarf stars , m31 disk stars , and residual background galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity of each m31 halo giant is measured using standard photometric and spectroscopic techniques , the latter based on the strength of the ca  ii triplet . </S>",
    "<S> the various [ fe / h ] estimates are in rough agreement with one another . </S>",
    "<S> the data reveal a large spread ( @xmath2  dex ) in [ fe / h ] in m31 s halo ; there is no strong radial [ fe / h ] gradient . </S>",
    "<S> lris and hires spectra are also presented for red giants in five dwarf spheroidal satellites of m31 : andi , andiii , andv , andvi , and andvii . there appears to be a significant metallicity spread in andvi and possibly in andi . </S>",
    "<S> the new radial velocity data on these outer dwarfs are used to constrain the total mass of m31 : the best estimate is under @xmath3 , somewhat less than the best estimate for the milky way . </S>"
