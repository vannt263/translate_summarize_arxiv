    "current density distribution and the ac losses of thin superconductors carrying ac current and/or subjected to external ac magnetic field can be calculated by solving the integral equations for the current density distribution by means of finite elements  @xcite .",
    "the integral equation ( ie ) model was first proposed in  @xcite for individual tapes ; then , it was extended to the case of interacting tapes in  @xcite , where the electromagnetic interaction between tapes was calculated by means of an auxiliary 2-d magnetostatic model ; finally , it was developed to the stage where the interaction between tapes is directly included in the integral equation to be solved  @xcite .",
    "the most important advantages of this approach , especially compared to analytical formulations , are that arbitrary current - voltage characteristics for the superconductor and the dependence of the superconductors parameters ( e.g. the critical current density @xmath0 ) on the position and the local magnetic field can be easily incorporated .",
    "the ie model has been successfully used to compute the ac losses of interacting tapes and a very good agreement with experimental data has been found for tapes characterized by a lateral variation of @xmath0  @xcite and arranged in a bifilar winding for fault - current limiter application  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the approach utilized in  @xcite to derive and solve the integral equations for the current density distribution in two other cases of practical interest , namely cables with radially and polygonally arranged thin superconducting tapes .",
    "the former is potentially interesting for bus bar applications ( especially with bidirectional currents , see  @xcite ) ; the latter can be useful to quickly estimate the losses of straight cable samples  @xcite .",
    "these configurations were analyzed by mawatari and kajikawa under the assumptions of the critical state model  @xcite .",
    "their method is not devoid of elegance , however their solutions are valid only for certain current levels ( @xmath1 for both configurations and @xmath2 for the polygonal configuration only ) , which are usually not found in practical applications . on the contrary ,",
    "the ie approach allows using arbitrary current levels .",
    "in addition , it can take the dependence of certain parameters on the local magnetic field and/or on the position inside the tape into account , see for example  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "this latter dependence is very important for simulating real rebco coated conductors , which often present a reduced @xmath0 near the edges due to the manufacturing process  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : derivation ] describes in detail the derivation of the integral equations for the cases under scrutiny .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] contains the main results of our investigation : we discuss the dependence of the ac losses on the geometrical parameters and we show the obtained current profiles ; differences from and analogies with the analytical models are pointed out .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusion ] draws the main conclusions .",

    ", we consider the vertices @xmath3 of a regular polygon with @xmath4 sides centered in the origin @xmath5 and a point @xmath6 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodicity ] .",
    "if we call @xmath7 the point @xmath6 and @xmath8 the point @xmath9 , the vertices of the polygon will be given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the @xmath4-th roots of the unity .",
    "based on the properties of those roots , we shall have @xmath12 taking the logarithm of both members , we have @xmath13 and by deriving with respect to @xmath7 we obtain the identity @xmath14      since in two - dimensions the biot - savart law for the magnetic field generated by a current line @xmath15 situated in @xmath8 can be expressed in the complex plane by the following complex expression @xmath16 we shall have that , according to ( [ eq : sum ] ) , the magnetic field generated by @xmath4 _ identical _ current lines situated in the vertices @xmath17 of a regular polygon of radius @xmath8 is @xmath18 in the case where @xmath19 and the currents have alternate signs , we can write @xmath20 using ( [ eq : sum ] ) and the fact that @xmath21 , for @xmath22 currents we can write @xmath23      let us consider the case where the magnetic field is generated by a distribution of current lines @xmath24 along a path @xmath25 with angular periodicity , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : periodicity ] . the magnetic field",
    "is obtained simply by integrating ( [ eq : hzn ] ) or ( [ eq : hzm ] ) along @xmath25 @xmath26 due to the angular periodicity it is sufficient to study the magnetic field in the angular sector @xmath27 .",
    "we will now study two cases interesting for practical applications : a system of @xmath4 tapes with radial and polygonal arrangement , which are schematically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : star - polygonal ] .",
    "let us place the tape along a segment @xmath28 on the @xmath29-axis with a current density distribution @xmath30  see fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] . the magnetic field will be given by the integral @xmath31    we can compute the flux ( in each tape ) between the edge @xmath32 and an arbitrary point @xmath33 as @xmath34 similarly to what was done in  @xcite , using this expression for the flux we can define the integral equation for the computation of the current density @xmath35 where the term @xmath36 is the contribution to the integral in  ( [ eq : flux ] ) due to the logarithmic part not dependent on the flux variable @xmath29 . in practice the @xmath36 term is obtained by imposing the total current @xmath37 flowing in each tape . for",
    "the solution of the integral equation by finite elements the term does not need to be explicitly introduced in the equation , since it is automatically evaluated by means of the integral constraint .",
    "@xmath38    in case of bidirectional currents ( neighboring tapes carrying current of the same amplitude but with opposite direction ) , one can follow the same procedure to find the integral equation for the current density @xmath39      in this case the tape can be represented by the segment @xmath40 at a distance @xmath41 from the origin ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : polygonal ] . obviously , in order to avoid tape overlapping , the condition @xmath42 must hold .",
    "according to ( [ eq : hz_gamma ] ) the magnetic field is given by the integral @xmath43 with this formula we can compute the flux ( in each tape ) between the edge @xmath44 and an arbitrary point @xmath45 as @xmath46 from this expression we can derive the integral equation for the current density @xmath47",
    "in this section we show the ac loss numerical results for various configurations , including a comparison with those obtained with the analytical models  @xcite .",
    "the plotted ac loss values represent the losses per tape , normalized by the loss value of a single isolated tape carrying the same transport current : it is therefore what we called a geometric factor , representing the change of the ac loss value with respect to that of a single isolated tape , due to the particular geometric configuration under scrutiny .    for our simulations",
    ", we considered a tape 12 mm wide with @xmath48  a and @xmath49 , representative of state - of - the - art ybco coated conductors .",
    "the frequency of the current source was 50  hz .    for validation purpose , we compared the current density profiles with those obtained by means of the 2-d fem model developed in  @xcite , always obtaining an excellent agreement  an example is shown later in this section .",
    "figure  [ fig : unidir ] shows the geometric factor of the cable with radially arranged tapes carrying current in the same direction as a function of the distance of the tapes from the center of the cable ",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : star ] for reference .",
    "this is not a convenient geometry from the point of view of ac losses because each tape undergoes the magnetic field generated by the neighbors . at the tape",
    "s edge the field contributions sum up , which results in losses that are always higher than those of a single isolated tape . the higher the number of tapes in the cable ,",
    "the higher the losses . plotted with a continuous line is the loss value predicted with the analytical model  @xcite , which was developed only for the case @xmath1 .",
    "it can be noticed that for the case @xmath50 the results of the ie model agree well with the analytical predictions , whereas for higher current values they are significantly different .",
    "the difference increases with the number of tapes in the cable .",
    " see fig .",

    "different scales are used for the two axes.,height=6 ]    figure  [ fig : bidir ] shows the same type of results as fig .  [",
    "fig : unidir ] , but for bidirectional currents , i.e. adjacent tapes carry the same current but with opposite direction .",
    "this is a more advantageous configuration from the point of view of ac losses , because in certain cases the losses are significantly lower than those of a single isolated tape .",
    "more specifically this happens for a sufficiently high number of tapes .",
    "this is due to the fact that , similarly to the case of bifilar coils  @xcite , the perpendicular component of the magnetic field at the tape s edge is significantly reduced .",
    "however , the distance of the tapes from the center also plays an important role and if the tapes are situated very close to the center of the cable ( @xmath54 ) the loss reduction vanishes , especially at high currents .",
    "also for this configuration we found a good agreement between the ie model and the analytical predictions in the case @xmath55 and substantial differences in the case of higher currents .",
    "figure  [ fig : j_profiles ] shows the current density profiles for @xmath56 ( @xmath52 mm , @xmath53 mm ) for different values of the transport current .",
    "the shape of the profile drastically changes with the current amplitude , and one can clearly see that only for very low currents the meissner - state approach described in  @xcite holds . in the figure ,",
    "results obtained with the 2-d fem model developed in  @xcite are also shown ( symbols ) .",
    "the overlapping of the profiles computed with the two models is perfect . due to periodicity , in the 2-d model",
    "one needs to simulate only one sector .",
    "the condition of uni- or bi - directional currents is obtained by appropriately setting the boundary conditions for the magnetic field ( state variable ) on the domain s boundary , see also fig .",
    "[ fig : hk_field ] . in the case of uni - directional currents ,",
    "the tangential component of the magnetic field vanishes on the simulated boundary ; conversely , in the case of bi - directional currents , the normal component vanishes ( as shown in the figure ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : poly ] shows the geometric factor of the losses for a polygonal cable .",
    "losses are plotted as a function of @xmath57 , and in the low current limit they are in excellent agreement with the results of the analytical model in  @xcite .",
    "the agreement with the analytical model is not as perfect in the case @xmath2 .",
    "this is most probably due to the intrinsic difference between the superconductor s characteristics in the two models : with the critical state model ( used in the analytical formulas ) the tape is filled with current at @xmath2 and @xmath58 everywhere ; on the contrary , with the power - law resistivity ( used in the ie model ) , current density values higher than @xmath0 are allowed and the @xmath59 is not just constant everywhere .    .",
    "the continuous and dashed lines indicate the analytical predictions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 from  @xcite , respectively.,height=6 ]",
    "we derived the integral equations for radially and polygonally arranged thin hts tapes and solved them by finite elements .",
    "the obtained results are in good agreement with existing analytical model , which are valid only for certain values of the transport current .",
    "our integral equation model , on the contrary , can consider arbitrary values of the transport current .",
    "another important advantage of the ie model is that the dependence of the critical current on the lateral position inside the tape or on the local magnetic field can be easily implemented .",
    "in addition , since only one tape is simulated in 1-d , the solution takes only few seconds ; the ie model can therefore be used to simulate a large number of configurations for design optimization purposes .    finally , we would like to conclude with a practical remark . similarly to the cases presented in  @xcite , the magnetic interaction between the tapes in integral equations  ( [ eq : ie_unidir ] ) , ( [ eq : ie_bidir ] ) , ( [ eq : ie_poly ] ) is expressed by a term @xmath60 , i.e. by the finite space convolution of the time derivative of the sheet current @xmath61 with a kernel @xmath62 of logarithmic type .",
    "this kernel is the only thing that need to be changed to study the different geometries .",
    "this means that one needs to build only one file in the finite element program and simply change the selection of the kernel to simulate different configurations .",
