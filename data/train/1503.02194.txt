    "this paper continues the rigorous study ( initiated in @xcite ) of the coupled time - harmonic motion of the mechanical system which consists of water and a rigid body freely floating in it .",
    "the former is bounded from above by a free surface , whereas the latter is assumed to be an infinitely long cylinder which allows us to investigate two - dimensional modes orthogonal to its generators .",
    "the body is surface - piercing and no external forces acts on it ( for example , due to constraints on its motion ) .",
    "the water domain is either infinitely deep or has a constant finite depth ; the surface tension is neglected on the free surface of water whose motion is irrotational .",
    "the motion of the whole system is supposed to be small - amplitude near equilibrium which allows us to use a linear model .    in the framework of the linear theory of water waves , the time - dependent problem describing the coupled motion of water and a freely floating surface - piercing rigid body",
    "was developed by @xcite .",
    "however , his formulation was rather cumbersome , and so during the second half of the 20th century the main efforts were devoted to various problems involving fixed bodies instead of freely floating ones ( see the summarising monograph by @xcite ) .",
    "the cornerstone was laid by @xcite himself who proved the first result guaranteeing the absence of trapped modes at all frequencies provided an immersed obstacle has a fixed position and is subject to a geometric restriction now usually referred to as john s condition . in the two - dimensional case ,",
    "it includes the following two requirements : ( i ) there is only one surface - piercing cylinder in the set of cylinders forming the obstacle ; ( ii ) the whole obstacle is confined within the strip between two vertical lines through the points , where the surface - piercing contour intersects the free surface of water , the part of bottom ( when the depth is finite ) is horizontal outside of this strip .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that if condition ( i ) holds , then condition ( ii ) can be replaced by a weaker one .",
    "namely , if the depth is infinite , then the whole obstacle must be confined to the angular domain between the lines inclined at @xmath0 to the vertical and going through the two points , where the surface - piercing contour intersects the free surface .",
    "if the depth is finite , then it is required that the whole obstacle is confined to a smaller angular domain between the lines going through the same two points , but inclined at a certain angle to the vertical that is a little bit less than @xmath0 .",
    "the results of @xcite and @xcite are illustrated in @xcite ; see pp .  125 , 126 and 137 , respectively .    in @xcite ,",
    "another geometric condition alternative to ( ii ) was found which together with ( i ) guarantees the absence of trapped modes at all frequencies for fixed bodies . this condition does not impose any restriction on the angle between the surface - piercing contour and the free surface ( arbitrarily small angles are admissible ) , but",
    "this is achieved at the expense that the wetted contour is subject to a certain point - wise restriction ( it must be transversal to curves in a certain definite fashion ) .",
    "on the other hand , condition ( i ) is essential for the absence of trapped modes .",
    "this became clear when @xcite constructed an example of such a mode for which purpose she applied the so - called semi - inverse method ( see , for example , @xcite for its brief description ) .",
    "her example involves two fixed surface - piercing cylinders each of which satisfies the modified condition ( ii ) of @xcite , but they are separated by a nonzero spacing .",
    "another example of a mode trapped by two fixed surface - piercing cylinders was found by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite proved that the latter cylinders can be considered as two immersed parts of a single body which freely floats in trapped waves , but remains motionless .",
    "(0.525 * 0.94 ) @xmath1 + (0.93 * 0.8 ) @xmath2 + (0.8 * 0.8 ) @xmath3 + (0.615 * 0.8 ) @xmath4 + (0.312 * 0.8 ) @xmath5 + (0.15 * 0.8 ) @xmath3 + (0.56 * 0.54 ) @xmath6 + (0.32 * 0.44 ) @xmath7 +    [ fig1 ]    during the past decade , the problem of the coupled time - harmonic motion of water and a freely floating rigid body has attracted much attention . along with the just mentioned paper @xcite ,",
    "rigorous results were obtained in @xcite , where a brief review of related papers is given .",
    "however , the substantial part of work concerns the study of trapped modes and the corresponding trapping bodies and only the paper @xcite has been focussed on conditions eliminating trapped modes in the case when a surface - piercing or totally submerged body is present ( for a surface - piercing body the original proof of @xcite was essentially simplified ) . in the present paper ,",
    "our aim is to fill in this gap at least partially .    in the present note ,",
    "we find conditions on the frequency so that they guarantee that no modes ( or some specific modes ) are trapped by a freely floating body provided its geometry satisfies the assumptions used in @xcite and @xcite for establishing the absence of modes trapped by the same body being fixed .",
    "let the cartesian coordinate system @xmath8 in a plane orthogonal to the generators of a freely floating infinitely long cylinder be chosen so that the @xmath1-axis is directed upwards , whereas the mean free surface of water intersect this plane along the @xmath2-axis , and so the cross - section @xmath9 of the water domain is a subset of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the bounded two - dimensional domain whose closure is the cross - section a floating cylinder in its equilibrium position .",
    "let both the immersed part @xmath12 and the above - water part @xmath13 be nonempty domains and @xmath14 be a nonempty interval of the @xmath2-axis , say @xmath15 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we suppose that @xmath9 is either @xmath16 when water has infinite depth ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) or @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , when water has constant finite depth . we suppose that @xmath9 is a lipschitz domain , and so the unit normal @xmath19 pointing to the exterior of @xmath9 is defined almost everywhere on @xmath20 .",
    "finally , by @xmath21 and @xmath22 we denote the wetted contour and the free surface at rest , respectively ; if water has finite depth , then @xmath23 is the bottom s cross - section .    for describing the small - amplitude coupled motion of the system it is standard to apply the linear setting in which case",
    "the following first - order unknowns are used .",
    "the velocity potential @xmath24 and the vector - column @xmath25 describing the motion of body whose three components are as follows :    @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the displacements of the centre of mass in the horizontal and vertical directions , respectively , from its rest position @xmath29 ;    @xmath26 @xmath30 is the angle of rotation about the axis that goes through the centre of mass orthogonally to the @xmath8-plane ( the angle is measured from the @xmath2- to @xmath1-axis ) .",
    "we omit relations governing the time - dependent behaviour ( see details in @xcite ) , and turn directly to the time - harmonic oscillations of the system for which purpose we use the ansatz @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the radian frequency , @xmath33 is a complex - valued function and @xmath34 . to be specific ,",
    "we first assume that @xmath9 is infinitely deep in which case the problem for @xmath35 is as follows:-6 mm @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the spatial gradient , @xmath38 is the acceleration due to gravity that acts in the direction opposite to the @xmath1-axis ; @xmath39 ( the operation @xmath40 transforms a vector - row into a vector - column and vice versa ) , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 stands for the vector product . in the equations of body s motion , the @xmath44 matrices are as follows : @xmath45 the positive elements of the mass / inertia matrix @xmath46 are @xmath47 { \\mathrm{d}\\kern0.2pt}x { \\mathrm{d}\\kern0.2pt}y , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the density distribution within the body and @xmath49 is the constant density of water . in the right - hand side of relation , we have forces and their moments . in particular , the first term is due to the hydrodynamic pressure , whereas the second one is related to the buoyancy ( see , for example , @xcite ) ; the non - zero elements of the matrix @xmath50 are @xmath51 note that the matrix @xmath50 is symmetric .    in relations , and , @xmath52 is a spectral parameter which is sought together with the eigenvector @xmath53 .",
    "since @xmath9 is a lipschitz domain and @xmath33 , relations  are , as usual , understood in the sense of the following integral identity : @xmath54 which must hold for an arbitrary smooth @xmath55 having a compact support in @xmath56 .",
    "finally , relations and specify the behaviour of @xmath57 at infinity .",
    "the first of these means that the velocity field decays with depth , whereas the second one yields that the potential given by formula describes outgoing waves .",
    "this radiation condition is the same as in the water - wave problem for a fixed obstacle ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the relations listed above must be augmented by the following conditions concerning the equilibrium position :    @xmath26 the mass of the displaced liquid is equal to that of the body : @xmath58 ( archimedes law ) ; @xmath26 the centre of buoyancy lies on the same vertical line as the centre of mass : @xmath59 ; @xmath26 the matrix @xmath50 is positive semi - definite ; moreover , the @xmath60 matrix @xmath61 that stands in the lower right corner of @xmath50 is positive definite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the last of these requirements yields the stability of the body s equilibrium position , which follows from the results formulated , for example , by @xcite ,  2.4 .",
    "the stability is understood in the classical sense that an instantaneous , infinitesimal disturbance causes the position changes which remain infinitesimal , except for purely horizontal drift , for all subsequent times .    in conclusion of this section",
    ", we note that relations and must be amended in the case when @xmath9 has finite depth .",
    "namely , the no flow condition @xmath62 replaces , whereas @xmath63 must be changed to @xmath64 in , where @xmath64 is the unique positive root of @xmath65 .",
    "it is known ( see , for example , @xcite ) , that a potential , satisfying relations , , and , has the asymptotic representation at infinity of the same type as green s function .",

    "\\mbox{as } \\ x^2 + y^2 \\to \\infty , \\label{eq : uas}\\ ] ] and the following equality holds @xmath67    assuming that @xmath68 is a solution of problem  , we rearrange the last formula using the coupling conditions and .",
    "first , transposing the complex conjugate of equation , we get @xmath69 this relation and condition yield that the inner product of both sides with @xmath70 can be written in the form : @xmath71 second , substituting this equality into , we obtain @xmath72 in the same way as in @xcite , this yields the following assertion about the kinetic and potential energy of the water motion .",
    "[ propos:1 ] let @xmath68 be a solution of problem  , then @xmath73 moreover , the following equality holds : @xmath74    here the kinetic energy of the water / body system stands in the left - hand side , whereas we have the potential energy of this coupled motion in the right - hand side .",
    "thus the last formula generalises the energy equipartition equality valid when a fixed body is immersed into water .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 for such a body , and turns into the well - known equality ( see , for example , formula ( 4.99 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "proposition 1 shows that if @xmath76 is a solution of problem  with complex - valued components , then its real and imaginary parts separately satisfy this problem .",
    "this allows us to consider @xmath77 as an element of the real product space @xmath78 in what follows ( the sum of two quantities defines an equivalent norm in @xmath79 ) .",
    "let the subsidiary conditions concerning the equilibrium position ( see   2 ) hold for the freely floating body @xmath11 . a non - trivial real solution @xmath80 of problem and",
    "is called a _ mode trapped _ by this body , whereas the corresponding value of @xmath52 is referred to as a _ trapping frequency_.    in order to determine when @xmath81 is not trapped by @xmath11 we write as follows : @xmath82 it is clear that the left - hand side is non - negative provided @xmath83 is sufficiently large , and so we arrive at the following .",
    "[ propos:2 ] let @xmath84 and @xmath50 be given by and let @xmath83 be greater than or equal to the largest @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 .",
    "if the domain @xmath9 is such that the inequality @xmath87 holds for every non - trivial @xmath88 , then @xmath52 is not a trapping frequency .",
    "note that if @xmath9 has finite depth , then @xmath63 must be changed to @xmath64 in relation , where the behaviour of the remainder must be also replaced by the following one : @xmath89 in relations and @xmath63 must be also changed to @xmath64 . on the other hand , formula remains be valid in the same form as above , and so proposition 2 is true in this case as well .",
    "we begin with the case when @xmath9 has infinite depth . by @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    "we denote the rays emanating at the angle @xmath0 to the vertical from the points @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively , and going to the right and left , respectively .",
    "let the whole rays @xmath90 and @xmath91 belong to @xmath9 for all @xmath94 .",
    "thus , @xmath6 is confined within the angular domain between the lines inclined at @xmath0 to the vertical and going through the points @xmath95 and @xmath96 to the right and left , respectively . under this assumption ,",
    "@xcite proved ( see also @xcite ,   3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2 ) that the inequality @xmath97 holds provided @xmath57 satisfies conditions and relations and . here",
    "@xmath98 is the subset of @xmath9 covered with rays @xmath99 . according to the last inequality ,",
    "if @xmath57 is non - trivial , then holds .",
    "therefore , proposition  2 is applicable , thus giving a criterion which values of @xmath52 are non - trapping frequencies for the freely floating @xmath11 whose immersed part @xmath6 is confined as described above .    in order to obtain inequality in the case",
    "when @xmath9 has finite depth , @xmath90 and @xmath91 must be replaced by similar segments connecting @xmath3 and @xmath100 and inclined at a certain angle to the vertical that is a little bit less than @xmath0 .",
    "numerical computations of @xcite show that the same result as for deep water is true when @xmath6 is confined between the segments inclined at @xmath101 .",
    "in this section , we turn to the case when @xmath6 does not satisfy the conditions of  3.2 . to be specific",
    ", we suppose that @xmath9 is bounded from below by the rigid bottom @xmath100 .",
    "moreover , we assume that @xmath11 is symmetric about the @xmath1-axis ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) ; this implies that @xmath102 @xmath103 attains the opposite ( the same , respectively ) values at every pair of points on @xmath6 which are symmetric about the @xmath1-axis .",
    "let also @xmath104 be an even function of @xmath2 , and so @xmath105 ( the centre of mass lies on the @xmath1-axis ) ; this implies that @xmath106 has the same behaviour as @xmath107 .",
    "the last restriction on @xmath11 or , more precisely , on @xmath6 is expressed in terms of the curves @xmath108 parametrised by @xmath109 . on curves of these two families",
    "we define directions as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is clear that all curves , that intersect @xmath100 transversally , enter into @xmath9 .",
    "let this property also hold on @xmath7 ; that is , all transversal intersections of curves with @xmath7 are points of entry into @xmath9 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) . in what follows ,",
    "a body satisfying the listed conditions is referred to as belonging to the class @xmath110 provided the conditions considered in  3.2 are not fulfilled for it .",
    "the following assertion generalises the criterion of @xcite guaranteeing the absence of trapped modes for fixed surface - piercing bodies immersed in deep water and satisfying the above transversality condition with the family of curves . as in proposition  2",
    "the values of @xmath52 that are not trapping frequencies must be sufficiently large , but what is new that some restrictions must be also imposed on the type of mode .",
    "[ propos:3 ] let @xmath9 have finite depth and let @xmath11 be a freely floating body belonging to the class @xmath110 . if @xmath83 is strictly greater than the largest @xmath85 such that @xmath111 with @xmath84 and @xmath50 given by",
    ", then @xmath52 is not a trapping frequency for modes of the form :    \\(a ) @xmath57 is an even function of @xmath2 and @xmath112    \\(b ) @xmath57 is an odd function of @xmath2 and @xmath113 .",
    "let us write relations  and using the bipolar coordinates @xmath114 .",
    "the corresponding conformal mapping is usually defined as follows ( see , for example , @xcite ,  10.1 ) : @xmath115 therefore , maps the strip @xmath116 onto @xmath117 so that for every @xmath118 the image of the left ( right ) half - line @xmath119 is the circular arc that lies in the left ( right ) half - plane ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath120 are mapped onto @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively .",
