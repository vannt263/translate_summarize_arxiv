    "term by term integration is one of the frequently used methods in evaluating integrals and in constructing asymptotic expansions of integrals .",
    "it typically involves expanding the integrand or a factor of it and then interchanging the order of summation and integration .",
    "of course the order can not be arbitrarily interchanged without satisfying certain uniformity conditions .",
    "but we , nevertheless , often chivalrously perform the interchange at the cost of introducing divergent integrals in an otherwise well defined integral .",
    "we often see this happen in asymptotic evaluation of integrals where the first step in constructing an asymptotic expansion is by deriving a formal expansion , say , by means of an appropriate expansion of the integrand followed by a term be term integration @xcite .",
    "the emergence of divergent integrals in such formal manipulation calls for their proper interpretation and treatment .",
    "the interpretation of divergent integrals is made complicated by the fact that a divergent integral may be assigned different values corresponding to different ways of interpreting the divergent integral .",
    "a divergent integral can be assigned meaningful value by means of analytic continuation @xcite , caesaro limits @xcite , regularization methods @xcite , distribution theory @xcite , or finite part integration @xcite or still by some other means @xcite . these generally assign different values to the divergent integral .",
    "a naive application of any of these interpretations of a divergent integral in term by term integration can lead to misleading results , sometimes yielding the correct value but more often correctly reproducing only some of the terms of the correct results but completely missing out some group of terms .",
    "the problem with naive term by term integration is exemplified by the asymptotic evaluation of the stieltjes transform @xmath3 .",
    "the canonical example is given by the integral @xcite @xmath4{1+x}\\ , ( \\omega+x)}\\mathrm{d}x   .\\ ] ] inserting the binomial expansion of @xmath5 at infinity and performing term by term integration lead to the infinite series @xmath6{1+x}\\ , ( \\omega+x)}\\mathrm{d}x\\leadsto \\sum_{s=0}^{\\infty } \\binom{-1/3}{s } \\int_0^{\\infty } \\frac{x^{-s-1/3}}{(\\omega+x ) } \\mathrm{d}x .\\ ] ] only the @xmath7 term exists and the rest of the integrals do not exist due to the non - integrable singularity at the origin .",
    "the question now arises as to how the divergent integrals should be interpreted .",
    "the divergent integrals can be interpreted in several ways .",
    "one way is to interpret them via analytic continuation .",
    "the idea behind `` analytic continuation is to match the divergent function of interest to an analytic function in a region where the original function is well behaved '' @xcite .",
    "for instance , we have the integral @xmath8 we can assign the divergent integral the value equal to the value of the analytic continuation of the right hand side of equation [ analex ] for @xmath9 . applying this interpretation , term by term integration leads to the asymptotic expansion @xmath10 the same result is obtained when the divergent integral is interpreted as a finite part integral .",
    "however , the given integral [ example ] can be evaluated explicitly and the result expanded for @xmath11 .",
    "the result is given by @xmath12    comparing expressions [ wrong ] and [ correct ] , we find that expression [ wrong ] correctly reproduces the first group of terms of [ correct ] but completely misses out the second group .",
    "this demonstrates how naive term by term integration involving divergent integrals can lead to missing terms .",
    "this problem for the stieltjes transform was resolved by mcclure and wong by interpreting the singular factors in the integrand as distributions and the divergent integral as a linear functional @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give term by term integration another look and the interpretation of divergent integrals that accompanies in such operation without appealing to distribution theory . here",
    "we will consider the incomplete stieltjes transform @xmath13 from which the well - known stieltjes transform can be recovered in the limit as @xmath14 , provided the limit exists.we will consider two expansions of the integrand leading to divergent integrals upon term by term integration , which are @xmath15 @xmath16 expansion [ expand1 ] is appropriate for term by term integration for small @xmath17 or at the origin ; and expansion [ expand2 ] is for term by term integration for large @xmath17 or at infinity . both expansions lead to the family of divergent integrals @xmath18 for some function @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "the later expansion [ expand2 ] has been the area of asymptotics and the area of application of the distributional approach due to mcclure and wong @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is for the first time that term by term integration involving divergent integrals arising from expansion [ expand1 ] is dealt with .    in this paper",
    "we will approach the problem of missing terms by lifting the integration in the complex plane .",
    "our solution to the problem is motivated by our recent work that saw the representation of the cauchy principal value and the hadamard finite part of the generalized principal value by fox @xcite as complex contour integrals @xcite .",
    "our results there hint that the emergent divergent integrals [ divergent ] can be interpreted as a finite part integral provided an appropriate contour integral representation of the finite part is obtained , and provided the original integral is likewise represented as a contour integral consistent with the contour integral representation of the finite part integral .",
    "we will pursue that hint here .",
    "to do so we will obtain the contour integral representation of the finite part of the divergent integrals [ divergent ] , from which we read off the required consistent contour integral representation of the incomplete stieltjes transform . replacing the integral [ incomplete ] with its equivalent contour integral representation in the complex plane and performing the term by term integration over this representation will lead us to uniquely identify the divergent integrals that arise as finite part integrals .",
    "moreover , we will find that the missing terms emerge as contributions coming from the complex singularities of the function @xmath21 ( which is the extension of the integrand @xmath22 in integral [ incomplete ] in the complex plane ) .    here",
    "we will primarily treat term by term integration arising from expansion [ expand1 ] , and show that the finite part integral in complex contour integral representation leads to an analytic ( exact ) evaluation of the incomplete stieltjes transform and the stieltjes transform in positive powers of @xmath17 .",
    "we will find , in particular , that the missing term arise from the simple pole of @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",
    "we will cursorily consider term by term integration arising from expansion [ expand2 ] , contenting ourselves with an application of our method to the specific example of a generalization of the canonical example , and demonstrating that our approach reproduces a known result of the distributional approach to asymptotics .",
    "we will find that , for the given example , the missing terms arise from the branch point of @xmath24 .",
    "we will treat elsewhere an in depth comparison of our approach to that of the distributional approach of mcclure and wong .",
    "overall , lifting the problem of term by term integration in the complex plane by way of the finite part integral offers a novel method in evaluating analytically and asymptomatically integral transforms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ contour ]",
    "we obtain the contour integral representation of the finite part of the divergent integrals [ divergent ] for pole ( @xmath25 ) and branch point ( @xmath26 ) singularities . in section [ origin ] , we perform term by term integration at the origin corresponding to the expansion [ expand1 ] for both cases of singularities involving entire integrands ; we derive the known series expansions of the exponential function and the incomplete gamma function as examples . in section [ origin2 ] ,",
    "we consider expansion at the origin for holomorphic integrands . in section [ infinity ]",
    "we perform term by term integration at infinity corresponding to the expansion [ expand2 ] for a specific class of integrals , the canonical example [ example ] is a special case of which .",
    "we now obtain the contour integral representation of the finite part of the divergent integral [ divergent ] under certain conditions to be detailed below . assuming that the function @xmath19 is locally integrable in the interval @xmath27 $ ] , the finite part integral is obtained by replacing the lower limit of integration by some positive @xmath28 .",
    "the resulting integral is then grouped in two terms , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the group of terms that posses a finite value in the limit as @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the group of terms that diverge in the same limit .",
    "the finite part of the divergent integral is obtained by dropping the diverging term @xmath32 and assigning the limit of @xmath30 as the value of the divergent integral , otherwise known as the finite part integral ( fpi ) @xcite , that is @xmath33 equivalently the finite part integral can expressed in the form @xmath34 .\\ ] ] these different representations of the finite part integral will serve us separate purposes .",
    "we will use equation [ limit1 ] to compute explicitly the finite part integral later ; while we will use equation [ limit2 ] to establish the desired contour integral representation of the finite part integral .",
    "now given the function @xmath19 , the complex extension of @xmath19 is the function , @xmath35 , obtained from @xmath19 itself by replacing the real variable @xmath36 with the complex variable @xmath37 . here , as in @xcite , we assume that the function @xmath19 has a complex extension , @xmath35 , that is analytic in some region of the complex plane containing the strip @xmath27 $ ]",
    ". we will denote the finite part of the divergent integral [ divergent ] under this assumption by @xmath38 .",
    "we distinguish this with the more familiar notation @xmath39 because the function @xmath19 does not not necessarily have an analytic extension in the complex plane for the finite part integral to exist .",
    "however , this is not much of a restriction because the functions @xmath19 involved in practice have analytic extensions .",
    "the contour integral representation of the divergent integral [ divergent ] will depend on the value of @xmath40 .",
    "the cases @xmath25 ( pole singularity ) and @xmath26 ( branch point singularity ) are distinct and have to be considered separately .",
    "the representation of the finite part integral given by equation [ limit1 ] or [ limit2 ] by a contour integral in the complex plane means that the fpi is the value of an absolutely convergent integral .",
    "this lifts the somewhat vague meaning of the finite part , and endows it with an unambiguous interpretation as a legitimate integral itself .",
    "let @xmath19 be @xmath41 continuously differentiable in the interval @xmath27 $ ] and @xmath42\\}<\\infty$ ] .",

    "the second and third terms in the left hand side of equation [ limit ] are exactly the diverging terms that have to be removed from the diverging first term to obtain a finite limit , or the diverging terms that have to be dropped to obtain the hadamard finite of the integral",
