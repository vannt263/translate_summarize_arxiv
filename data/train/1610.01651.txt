    "mixing in fluids is a question of fundamental interest in engineering , the physical sciences , and the natural sciences , with applications ranging from industrial and chemical mixing on small and large scales , to preventing the spreading of pollutants in geophysical flows . in many applications ( e.g.  microfluid mixing  @xcite ) homogeneity requirements for mixtures are becoming more stringent as mixing technology improves and new materials are developed .",
    "the goal of this work is to introduce a general purpose method for manipulating the mixing of fluids , under user - specified limits on the extent of the external changes to the generating dynamical flow .",
    "we refer the reader to the book of sturman _",
    "@xcite for mathematical foundations of advective ( kinematic ) mixing , and to @xcite for a recent survey of chaotic advection . for @xmath1 a smooth manifold , and @xmath2 a steady . ]",
    "vector field , the fokker - planck equation ( or kolmogorov forward equation or advection - diffusion equation ) @xmath3 describes the evolution of a concentration field @xmath4 in the fluid .",
    "the right hand side of ( [ fpe ] ) is a second order elliptic operator @xmath5 ( the infinitesimal generator ) whose spectrum lies in the left half of the complex plane . for steady flows ,",
    "the eigenfunction corresponding to the zero eigenvalue describes the steady state concentration field .",
    "the rate at which initial concentrations converge to this equilibrium concentration depends on the gap between the imaginary axis and the real part of the next spectral value .",
    "an important global feature of mixing , _ strange eigenmodes _",
    "@xcite , arises directly from eigenfunctions of the infinitesimal generator .",
    "strange eigenmodes are eigenfunctions of the infinitesimal generator that correspond to eigenvalues close to the imaginary axis , when the remainder of the spectrum is much farther from the imaginary axis ; that is , there is a large spectral gap between the two collections of eigenvalues .",
    "this large spectral gap means that the strange eigenmodes decay much more slowly and survive over much longer timescales than lower eigenmodes ; see @xcite for a discussion in the present setting and @xcite for analogous results in discrete time .",
    "the term  strange \" was suggested since the spatial scale of the eigenmode can be arbitrarily small as the diffusion approaches zero . when the flow is time - periodic , the strange eigenmodes are themselves time - periodic @xcite",
    "; see also @xcite and @xcite for the discrete time case with periodic and aperiodic driving , respectively . at low pclet numbers ( @xmath6 small ) , level sets of the strange eigenmodes correspond to parts of the domain @xmath7",
    "that are almost - invariant @xcite ( resp .",
    "almost - periodic @xcite ) under the steady flow @xmath8 ( resp .  under the periodically driven flow @xmath9 ) .",
    "if the goal is to enhance mixing , then one of the outcomes of our approach will be to weaken the invariance properties of these structures .",
    "the concept of strange eigenmodes has been applied to the identification of oceanic gyres @xcite , and the tracking of atmospheric vortices @xcite and ocean eddies @xcite .",
    "strange eigenmodes have also been investigated in the context of open flows @xcite and flows in batchelor - regime turbulence , where the momentum diffusivity is much larger than the scalar diffusivity  @xcite .    in prototype flows of industrial mixing and static mixing devices , a  _ mapping method _",
    "introduced in @xcite has been recently applied to analyse , design and optimize mixing protocols  @xcite for time - periodic flows .",
    "we remark that the mapping method @xcite is equivalent to ulam s method @xcite , which we introduce later .",
    "before one can optimize mixing , one first needs to quantify mixing .",
    "popular mixing measures in the advection - diffusion setting have been based on quantities such as dispersion statistics and spatial variance of passive scalar concentrations ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "mathew , mezi and petzold @xcite introduced a multiscale measure for mixing on tori .",
    "this multiscale norm , called the mix - norm , is equivalent to a sobolev norm of index @xmath10 .",
    "if one instead uses an index of @xmath11 , the decay of a concentration field in the corresponding sobolev norm is equivalent to weak convergence of the concentration field to zero in @xmath12 , provided the concentration field remains uniformly bounded in @xmath12 for all @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "further , if one obtains the above weak convergence for all @xmath14 with zero mean , then this is equivalent to the notion of mixing in ergodic theory @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a detailed review on multiscale norms , including an extensive list of references .",
    "our approach in the present work is to quantify the ( exponential ) mixing rate as the largest nontrivial real part of the spectrum of the generator ; that is , @xmath15 if @xmath16 is a concentration field with zero mean , we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant depending on @xmath16 , but the _ rate @xmath19 is independent of @xmath16_. thus , one has that @xmath20 converges _ exponentially quickly ( at rate @xmath19 ) to zero in @xmath12 norm_. with these established methods of quantifying mixing , one can now turn to the problem of _ optimising _ mixing .",
    "existing methods include switching the vector field between a small number of prespecified vector fields @xcite , or by additionally optimising a small number of parameters for the vector field @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above work we carry out a _ full _ optimisation over all vector fields in a small neighborhood of the provided vector field , rather than a restricted low - dimensional optimisation based on switching between specified vector fields or tuning a small number of control parameters .",
    "the problem we solve is more difficult because of its high dimensionality , but the payoff is that we can find more efficiently mixing vector fields because we do not restrict ourselves to a handful of prespecified vector fields .",
    "other approaches which can be viewed in this high - dimensional category include @xcite , who determine an instantaneous vector field ( perhaps far from the current vector field ) which most rapidly stirs the current concentration field , and @xcite who determine an optimal local diffusion to minimize the @xmath12 distance between the current concentration field and the steady state in one time step .",
    "another crucial difference between our current approach and all previous approaches mentioned above is that our proposed optimisation provides a guaranteed mixing rate for _ all _ initial concentration , and is not only effective for a specific initial concentration .",
    "this advantage arises from the manipulation of the _ spectrum _ of the generator , rather than the manipulation of _ norms of specific concentration fields_. other work on fluid mixing includes @xcite who identify optimal source distributions which are best mixed for given stirring field and diffusivity .",
    "balasuriya @xcite surveys dynamical systems techniques to enhance mixing in the context of microfluids .",
    "our focus in this paper is to numerically determine an optimal small perturbation of a given vector field which most enhances mixing .",
    "this goal can be easily reversed to find an optimal small perturbation that _ most inhibits mixing _ , and further , one can also _ target specific strange eigenmodes _ to either weaken or strengthen their effect on overall mixing .",
    "our approach is based on representing this difficult nonlinear problem as a linear problem via the generator of the flow .",
    "we use a low - order approximation method known as `` ulam s method for the generator '' : we ( indirectly ) compute a time derivative of the matrix produced by the usual ulam s method ; see @xcite .",
    "this approach , which is strongly related to the upwind scheme in finite volume methods @xcite has many advantages , perhaps most importantly the considerably reduced numerical effort as time integration of trajectories is no longer required as in the standard ulam approach @xcite . once in this linear",
    "( but high - dimensional ) form , we use finite difference methods to create a linear program which may be solved using standard software ( e.g. a standard implementation of simplex or barrier methods ) .",
    "we illustrate our numerical approach on a steady two - dimensional flow and a periodically driven two - dimensional flow .",
    "our approach is very flexible : it allows the trivial introduction of practical constraints , such as prohibiting perturbations ( i ) in certain parts of the spatial domain and ( ii ) at certain times in the case of periodic driving .",
    "moreover , it is also trivial to make the size of the perturbation depend on either space or time , or both .",
    "our results show that by making small changes to the vector field , dramatic changes in the dynamics and mixing of the fluid flow can be achieved .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : generator ] we describe in more detail our mathematical setting and define the generator for the steady and periodically driven situations . section [ sec : gennum ] outlines the numerical approximation of the generator ; specifically ulam s method for the generator @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we develop the linear program which forms the core of the paper .",
    "we begin by introducing the necessary constraints to ensure that the feasible region is the class of matrices that are interpretable as ulam generators .",
    "we then move on to the constraints that ensure that the perturbed ulam generator corresponds to a generator for a vector field that is a small perturbation of the original vector field , and finally , we construct the objective itself . having performed the numerical optimisation , section [ sec : interp ] then describes how to extract a perturbed vector field from the perturbed ulam generator matrix .",
    "two case studies are presented in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the first is a steady two - dimensional flow . in this",
    "setting the advective dynamics is rather rigid : particle trajectories must either move around closed curves or approach equilibrium points .",
    "we show that even in this rather inflexible situation , one can still make significant improvements in the mixing rate by small modifications to the vector field .",
    "the second case study is a periodically - driven two - dimensional flow where the advective dynamics displays both chaotic and regular ( integrable ) regimes .",
    "we demonstrate how a relatively small perturbation can achieve a large increase in the size of the chaotic region and a corresponding decrease in the regular region , leading to a sharp improvement in mixing .",
    "finally , for the same system , we specifically target the regular regions and using small perturbations , ( i ) destroy the regular regions as much as possible , and ( ii ) enhance the regular regions as much as possible .",
    "our domain @xmath1 is a smooth , compact manifold and @xmath21 denotes the volume measure on @xmath7 .",
    "we begin by discussing the autonomous setting before extending the discussion to the periodically - driven case .",
    "we denote by @xmath22 the vector field that generates the flow ; we assume that @xmath23 is at least @xmath0 and that unique solutions of @xmath8 exist in both time directions .",
    "the flow map generated by the vector field is denoted @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the location of a trajectory after beginning at @xmath26 and flowing for @xmath27 units of time .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 preserves an absolutely continuous invariant probability measure @xmath29 ; that is , @xmath30 for all borel measurable @xmath31 and for all @xmath32 .",
    "for example , if the flow is incompressible ( i.e.  @xmath23 is divergence - free ) , then @xmath29 is normalised volume : @xmath33 .",
    "we denote the density of @xmath29 with respect to lebesgue by @xmath34 .",
    "associated with the flow map @xmath28 is the transfer ( or perron - frobenius ) operator @xmath35 defined by @xmath36 the operator @xmath37 is the natural push - forward on densities for @xmath27 units of time , and invariance of @xmath38 can be stated as @xmath39 for all @xmath32 .",
    "the transfer operator is generated by the _ infinitesimal operator _ or _ generator _",
    "@xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the set of @xmath43 functions where the limit exists . from this definition , it is clear that @xmath44 .",
    "it is well - known that for continuously differentiable @xmath45 , one has @xmath46 and that functions @xmath47 satisfy the continuity equation @xmath48 the operator @xmath5 `` generates '' @xmath49 because @xmath50 for @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; this is the content of the spectral mapping theorem @xcite ( theorem 2.2.4 ) .    in the sequel we consider the generator of the sde @xmath54 for small @xmath6 , where @xmath55 represents brownian motion .",
    "the reason for the introduction of a wiener process is mainly to simplify the functional analytic setup .",
    "the corresponding generator is @xmath56 and one is concerned with solutions of the fokker - planck ( or forward kolmogorov or advection - diffusion ) equation @xmath57 initialised with some @xmath58 , and with zero neumann boundary conditions on @xmath59 ( the latter ensure that mass is preserved in @xmath7 by this `` no flux '' condition ) .",
    "the operator @xmath5 is elliptic , but not self - adjoint in general , and one can find a @xmath60 such that @xmath61 consists only of the eigenvalue @xmath62 . associated with the eigenvalue @xmath62 is the unique equilibrium concentration @xmath38 of the associated stochastic process : @xmath44 .",
    "the real part of the eigenvalue @xmath63 closest to the imaginary axis controls the mixing rate of the sde ( more negative , faster mixing ) , and it is this spectral gap between @xmath64 and @xmath65 that we wish to widen through perturbation of @xmath23 .      for periodically - driven flows we have @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the driving period and @xmath68 is the circle of unit circumference .",
    "the flow map is @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the location of a trajectory after beginning at @xmath26 at a time @xmath71 , and flowing for @xmath27 units of time .",
    "associated with the flow map @xmath28 is the transfer ( or perron - frobenius ) operator @xmath72 defined by @xmath73 if we were to take the limit ( [ gen_limit ] ) we would obtain a different operator @xmath74 at each @xmath75 , and none of these would generate @xmath49 in the usual sense .",
    "therefore , following the constructions in @xcite we augment the phase space by defining @xmath76 .",
    "further , as in the autonomous setting , we add a brownian motion term to yield a simpler spectral theory .",
    "we have @xmath77 or alternatively , @xmath78 where the augmented state  @xmath79 , the vector field  @xmath80 , and @xmath81 is a  @xmath82-dimensional standard wiener process , and @xmath83 where  @xmath84 is the identity matrix . the generator on this augmented phase space",
    "can be obtained from the fokker ",
    "planck equation associated with  .",
    "let @xmath85 and denote @xmath86 on each time fibre @xmath87 by @xmath88 .",
    "we have @xmath89 where by ( [ gen_eps ] ) , one has @xmath90 we call  @xmath91 the _ augmented generator_. the spectral structure of @xmath91 in the periodically driven setting is similar to the spectrum of @xmath5 in the autonomous setting ; see @xcite for details .",
    "in particular , we wish to widen the spectral gap between the imaginary axis and the eigenvalue @xmath63 with real part closest to the imaginary axis .",
    "our strategy for optimally perturbing the vector field @xmath23 in some pre - specified neighborhood to maximize the rate of mixing is to work directly with the generator rather than the vector field . in order to practically optimize the generator we require some finite - dimensional numerical representation .",
    "moreover , it is advantageous if there is a simple connection between this numerical representation and the underlying vector field .",
    "our numerical method of choice is the `` ulam s method for the generator '' method , developed in @xcite , and we refer the reader to this paper for details beyond those presented here .",
    "the recent work of @xcite extends this methodology to the situation of periodically driven dynamics , which is of particular interest in fluid dynamics .",
    "we describe the method first for autonomous vector fields and then the required modifications for periodically - driven systems .",
    "partition @xmath7 into rectangular sets of identical size to form @xmath92 , and let @xmath93 denote the span of the indicator functions on the elements of @xmath94 .",
    "the standard ulam s method @xcite to estimate the action of transfer operators on @xmath93 can be adapted to create an approximate generator @xmath95 ( also acting on @xmath93 ) by using ( [ gen_limit ] ) with @xmath49 replaced by its ulam version ; see @xcite .",
    "it may then be shown that the matrix representation of @xmath96 , under left multiplication , is given by the following formula : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the @xmath99-dimensional volume measure induced on co - dimension 1 surfaces ( used here to integrate over a face of a rectangular prism ) , and @xmath100 is the unit normal vector pointing out of @xmath101 into @xmath102 ( or the zero vector if @xmath103 is empty ) .",
    "given @xmath104 , one computes @xmath105 .",
    "it is shown in lemma 4.7 @xcite that there exists a nonnegative , nonzero @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of @xmath108 is confined to the left half of the complex plane .",
    "the matrix @xmath108 is related to the upwind scheme in finite - volume methods @xcite and the spatial discretisation of @xmath7 into @xmath94 induces a numerical diffusion .",
    "thus , as remarked in @xcite , the generator @xmath95 is in fact a better numerical approximation of an sde of the type ( [ sde ] ) for suitable @xmath109 and covariance matrix , than the deterministic ode @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite that @xmath108 can be regarded as a rate matrix for a markov jump process , identifying each box as a state . in our computations , we use a partition @xmath94 into cubes , or approximate cubes , so as to make this numerical diffusion as isotropic as possible .",
    "we therefore think of @xmath95 as an approximate generator for a process of the type ( [ sde ] ) .",
    "we compute the integral in ( [ ulamformula2 ] ) by numerical quadrature .      in the periodically - driven setting ,",
    "we use exactly the same constructions as above , but now @xmath94 is a partition of the augmented space @xmath110 into rectangles with are approximately cubic . we remark that if two rectangles @xmath101 and @xmath102 intersect at a face perpendicular to the time direction , the integral in ( [ ulamformula2 ] ) is simply @xmath111 ; in particular , no quadrature is required for these faces .",
    "recall that we wish to increase the @xmath12-mixing rate @xmath19 ( defined in ( [ l2mix ] ) ) of the sde ( [ sde ] ) ( resp .  ( [ eq : augsde ] ) ) in the autonomous ( resp .",
    "periodically - driven ) setting , by increasing the spectral gap of @xmath108 from the imaginary axis .",
    "we now discuss this problem of optimising the spectrum of @xmath108 subject to necessary and desirable constraints .",
    "first , we attend to the necessary constraints .",
    "suppose that we perturb the matrix @xmath108 by adding a perturbation matrix @xmath112 .",
    "the resulting matrix @xmath113 should satisfy various conditions .",
    "note that all of the following constraints are linear in @xmath112 .",
    "[ [ conservation - of - mass ] ] conservation of mass : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    conservation of mass is expressed as @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the @xmath12-adjoint of @xmath95 .",
    "we require that the perturbed generator also conserve mass . in terms of @xmath108",
    "this is expressed as @xmath116 .",
    "thus we insist that @xmath117    [ [ signs - of - entries - of - a_ne ] ] signs of entries of @xmath113 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a necessary condition for @xmath113 to be a genuine generator is that the signs of the entries of @xmath113 match those prescribed in ( [ ulamformula2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , diagonal entries are non - positive and off - diagonal entries are non - negative , or in symbols , @xmath118    [ [ preservation - of - the - same - equilibrium - distribution ] ] preservation of the same equilibrium distribution : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    suppose that @xmath119 is the invariant density of the approximate generator @xmath95 ; one has @xmath120 , or @xmath121 . after adding the perturbation , it is likely that we wish to preserve the same invariant density .",
    "an important example of this principle is that a volume - preserving flow should remain volume - preserving after the perturbation .",
    "thus , we require @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the coefficients of the step function @xmath124 .    [ [ flow - can - only - occur - through - rectangles - with - adjacent - faces ] ] flow can only occur through rectangles with adjacent faces : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    if two rectangles @xmath101 and @xmath102 do not meet at a face then there can be no flow directly from @xmath101 to @xmath102 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 in fact , at the discrete level of rectangles , there should not be flow out of @xmath101 into @xmath102 _ and _ vice - versa .",
    "a simple way to enforce this , which is only a mild restriction on the generality of @xmath112 , is to allow outflow from @xmath101 into @xmath102 according to the perturbed generator only when there was already such an outflow for the original generator .",
    "we do this in all reported numerical experiments in section [ sec : numerics ] .      at this point ,",
    "if @xmath113 satisfies the above conditions , it is a perfectly good ulam generator .",
    "however , by making the entries of @xmath112 larger , which corresponds to making the underlying flow faster , we can trivially speed up the rate of mixing simply by putting e.g.  @xmath126 for some large @xmath127 ; this would correspond to replacing @xmath23 with @xmath128 .",
    "our goal is to maximize the mixing rate while only perturbing within a _ small neighborhood _ of the original vector field .",
    "thus , we require additional constraints on @xmath112 to remain in such a neighborhood .",
    "the discussion below is for the autonomous setting ; afterwards we describe the necessary changes in the periodically driven settting",
    ". the user may be satisfied with only a subset of the following constraints , for example , only constraining the optimized velocity field or the optimal perturbation , but not both . for completeness",
    "we describe how to constrain both .    by inspecting ( [ ulamformula2 ] ) , we see that we may interpret @xmath129 as the mean , normal , outward velocity on the face @xmath103 divided by the diameter of the rectangles in this normal direction . therefore , given a matrix @xmath108 , we can infer a corresponding spatially discretized vector field at the centroids of the rectangle faces , denoted @xmath130 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the rectangle diameter in the direction normal to @xmath103 .",
    "as we assume that the rectangles comprising @xmath94 are identical , there are only @xmath133 distinct values for the @xmath132 .",
    "we now detail several constraints to control the perturbed , discrete vector field , denoted by @xmath134 .",
    "we denote by @xmath135 a vector field created from @xmath134 by a smooth interpolation .    in the time - periodic case ,",
    "we apply ( [ maxspeed])([maxderivpert ] ) only when @xmath103 has normal pointing in a spatial ( not the temporal ) direction . if @xmath103 has normal in the time direction we set @xmath136 as we can not adjust the flow of time .",
