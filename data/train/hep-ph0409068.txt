    "in this meeting we have talked mainly about nuclei and baryons but i will concentrate on mesons .",
    "the reason is that the lightest mesons are the simplest bound states present in quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "they have the minimal number of constituents and are the lightest state so should be spatially the simplest .",
    "their properties are to a large extent determined by chiral symmetry which enforces vanishing masses in the limit of zero current quark masses , the chiral limit , as well as vanishing interactions in the zero momentum and chiral limit .",
    "it is the combination of these two properties that allows us to produce a well defined low energy theory , chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , as a consistent approximation to qcd . in the remainder",
    "i review chpt at two loops .",
    "the underlying idea is really the essence of ( most of ) physics .",
    "_ use the right degrees of freedom_. when there is a gap in the spectrum with a consequent separation of scales , we can build the theory containing only the lighter degrees of freedom and include the effects of the neglected high mass / energy states perturbatively by building the most general ( local ) lagrangian with the low mass degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads in general to an infinite number of parameters so no predictivity is left .",
    "but when these terms can be ordered in importance by some principle , usually referred to as power counting , we have a finite number of parameters at any given order and thus an effective theory .",
    "we need to use field theory since it is the only known way to locally combine quantum mechanics and special relativity .",
    "a taylor expansion can not be used because in the chiral limit the continuum of states gives it zero convergence radius . as important is the fact that off - shell effects are fully under control . the freedom allowed by this",
    "is fully described by extra free parameters .",
    "in addition it is systematic , _ all _ effects at a given order in the expansion are included and errors can be estimated .",
    "drawbacks are of course the large number of free parameters , but do not forget the fact that while a model can have few parameters there is a large freedom in the space of possible models hidden behind it , and as always the expansion itself might also not converge .    for chpt the included",
    "degrees of freedom are the goldstone bosons from spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry , identified with the pseudoscalar octet , @xmath5 , @xmath6,@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the powercounting principle is dimensional counting , counting powers of generic momenta @xmath10 , and the expected breakdown scale is the mass of the neglected resonances , on the order of @xmath11 .",
    "chiral symmetry is the interchange of @xmath12 quarks which in the limit @xmath13 can be done independently for the left and right chirality since the qcd lagrangian , @xmath14\\,,\\ ] ] does not couple left and right in the chiral limit .",
    "the symmetry group is @xmath15 and is spontaneously broken to the diagonal subgroup by @xmath16 .",
    "the 8 broken generators correspond to the pseudoscalart octet .",
    "chpt in its present form was introduced by weinberg , gasser and leutwyler @xcite and introductory lectures can be found in @xcite .    in the case of lattice qcd",
    "we need to extend this .",
    "one distinguishes between valence and sea quarks and they can be treated independently .",
    "a simple example of how a meson loop contains quark loops is shown in fig .",
    "[ figpq ] . in general",
    "it is much easier to get to light valence quarks than to light sea quarks .",

    "the version of chpt with sea and valence quarks separately is called partially quenched chpt ( pqchpt ) .",
