    "establishing the determinants of biological diversity is a fundamental question in biology .",
    "a particular aspect of this question that has attracted a great deal of attention is the distribution ( in genotype or phenotype space ) of a population of interacting organisms , and to what extent and under what conditions clusters of similar individuals tend to arise  @xcite .",
    "a better understanding of this question could shed some light onto the process of sympatric speciation , whereby a ` mother ' species splits into two or more other species without geographic isolation @xcite .",
    "there is a history of mathematical models proposed to elucidate the mechanisms whereby species ( as clusters of phenotypically similar organisms ) tend to form spontaneously due to competition  @xcite . models",
    "initially considered asexual populations , to facilitate analytical tractability .",
    "it was shown that spontaneous clustering can occur  @xcite , but the phenomena is somewhat sensitive to particular assumptions about the functional form of the interaction kernels used  @xcite , questioning the biological relevance of the findings .",
    "models in which reproduction is sexual tend to lead to spontaneous clustering with less restrictive assumptions  @xcite , but the biological realism of the conditions required has also been questioned  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that stochastic effects can greatly increase the range of parameters for which species are formed in asexual models  @xcite , presenting stochastic pattern formation as a novel mechanism for speciation , which has particular biological implications  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will study the effects of stochasticity in a speciation model with sexual reproduction .",
    "we will show that demographic stochasticity can increase the parameter range in which species clustering is observed and that , in some cases , noise can have a sizeable effect , rendering the deterministic modelling insufficient to understand the phenotype distribution .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we will present the model as well as its mathematical formulation in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in sec .",
    "[ sectiondet ] we will present the analysis in the deterministic ( large population ) limit , summarising some previously known results and presenting some new ones .",
    "we will then perform the analysis of the stochastic effects in sec .",
    "[ sec : stochastic ] , highlighting the cases in which noise effects are largest .",
    "we will conclude with a summary and conclusions .",
    "some technical details are left for two appendixes .",
    "the model consists of a population of individuals which reproduce sexually and die through competition with each other .",
    "each individual is described by its phenotype , which determines the extent to which the organism competes with other organisms , and the likelihood with which it can mate with a given other organism . for simplicity , we will assume that the phenotype is well described by a single scalar variable which can take on all possible real values .",
    "a simple example in which a single scalar variable is the main determinant of the strength of competition between organisms could be the beak size in birds or the jaw size in lizards  @xcite ( which determines the extent to which they feed on the same resources ) , or in general , body size .",
    "the model is stochastic in that deaths and births are random events ( which , however , take place with probabilities determined by the state of the system ) .",
    "there are two basic processes :    * _ death_.the death rate ( probability per unit time ) of individual @xmath0 , @xmath1 , is given by @xmath2^{-1}\\,\\sum_jg(x_i - x_j)$ ] , where @xmath3 is the competition kernel that quantifies the strength with which two individuals with phenotype distance @xmath4 compete , @xmath5 is a constant that controls the overall carrying capacity of the ecosystem and @xmath6 is a function that determines the relative intrinsic advantage of phenotype @xmath4 .",
    "* _ reproduction_. each individual reproduces at a rate one . the probability that individual @xmath0 mates with individual @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath8 , with @xmath9 a function determining the strength of assortment ( preference for individuals which are alike ) .",
    "if individuals @xmath0 and @xmath7 mate , an offspring is generated with phenotype given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a random variable with probability density function @xmath12 .",
    "this models mutation about the average of the parents phenotype @xmath13 .",
    "this simple reproduction rule is justified when the character under consideration is determined by a large number of additive genes ( that is , without dominance or epistasis  @xcite ) ; in this limit , the ` reproduction noise ' , @xmath11 , is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance given by @xmath14 , that , for simplicity , will be assumed to be phenotype - independent ( the influence of this quantity will be one of the main aspects of our investigation ) . the function @xmath6 modulates the relative advantage of the phenotypes",
    "; it typically decays to zero for large @xmath15 , constraining the phenotypes to a given region of interest .",
    "we are also assuming that the organisms are hermaphroditic , but this assumption will be relaxed later .",
    "the model is a generalisation of the asexual model studied in  @xcite .",
    "following  @xcite , we will describe the state of the system by the density in phenotype space , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the number of organisms at time @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the dirac delta function .",
    "we have introduced the carrying capacity , @xmath5 , to obtain a function @xmath21 that has a well - defined @xmath22 limit .    when an organism with phenotype @xmath23 dies , @xmath21 is modified by the subtraction of delta function centred at @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , if a new organism with phenotype @xmath23 is born , @xmath21 is modified by the addition of a delta function at @xmath23 . with this in mind",

    "the definition of the process implies that @xmath32 is given by : @xmath33    the probability that individual @xmath0 , if it mates , does so with individual @xmath7 is @xmath34 . the probability density that their offspring has phenotype @xmath4",
    "is given by @xmath35 , where @xmath12 is the gaussian probability density with variance @xmath14 .",
    "with this in mind , we see that the rate density at which a new individual is created with phenotype @xmath4 , @xmath36 , is : @xmath37 combining the two contributions to the change in @xmath31 , the probability density of finding the system at state @xmath31 at time @xmath19 , @xmath38 , changes in time according to the following functional master equation @xcite : @xmath39dx.\\label{me}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    due to the non - linearity of the system ( that arises due to the interactions ) we are unable to obtain an exact solution and some approximation scheme is needed to proceed . expanding the @xmath40 operators in eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) to second order in @xmath41 , we can derive a functional fokker - planck equation , given in appendix  [ appfpe ] .",
    "for our purposes , it is clearer to work with the equivalent stochastic differential equation which takes the form ( see eqs .",
    "( [ sde_general ] ) and ( [ corr_gen ] ) ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a gaussian white noise with zero mean and with a correlator which is given by eq .",
    "( [ corr_gen ] ) of the appendix .",
    "it is interesting to compare this equation with the analogous equation in the asexual case .",
    "there @xmath44 and so @xmath45 .",
    "then eq .  ( [ sde_specific ] ) becomes @xmath46 which is the equation found in ref .",
    "@xcite , apart from the function @xmath6 , which was not included in the form of the model previously analysed ( note that we are allowing self - fertilization since , for simplicity , in eq .",
    "( [ birthrate ] ) we do not exclude @xmath47 ; forbidding the @xmath47 case would add @xmath48 terms ) .",
    "we will now analyse eq .",
    "( [ sde_specific ] ) , first of all in the deterministic limit , and then in the general stochastic setting .",
    "the deterministic limit corresponds to taking @xmath22 , and so the governing equation is simply eq .",
    "( [ sde_specific ] ) , but with the last ( noise ) term absent .",
    "some progress may be made analytically if we assume that the ecological functions , namely the competition kernel [ @xmath3 ] , the mating function [ @xmath50 , the function modulating the carrying capacity [ @xmath6 ] and the offspring distribution [ @xmath12 ] , are all gaussian functions .",
    "we denote their variances by @xmath53 and @xmath14 , respectively . in this case",
    ", the deterministic equation has a gaussian stationary solution , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 both satisfying complicated algebraic equations ; the equation for @xmath55 being first derived by doebeli et .",
    "these authors also found that numerical integration of the deterministic equation showed that when @xmath57 and @xmath14 are small compared with @xmath58 , there is an intermediate range of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , for which the gaussian solution becomes unstable and a multi - modal stationary solution is obtained .",
    "the random mating case ( @xmath61 ) is particularly interesting to analyse . in this limit",
    ", the equation for @xmath55 reduces to a cubic equation @xmath62 , where @xmath63 since @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the cubic equation always has a single positive solution .",
    "this then is the required solution . in this limit , the constant @xmath56",
    "is found to be @xmath66 ( we have not taken @xmath6 to be normalised ; @xmath67 , so that @xmath58 controls the size of phenotype space available ) .",
    "if we now , in addition , investigate the @xmath68 limit ( the most relevant when the phenotype distribution is not too constrained by the external fitness landscape ) , we find two very different regimes , depending on the relative width of the competition kernel and the reproduction noise distribution .",
    "when the reproduction noise , @xmath14 , is smaller than a critical value given by @xmath69 , the variance of the phenotype distribution is small and independent of @xmath58 , @xmath70 . if @xmath55 depends on @xmath58 in a way which means that it diverges as @xmath68 , then the term @xmath71 dominates over the term quartic in @xmath72 and the term quadratic in @xmath72 dominates over @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , @xmath74 , and this implies that if the reproduction noise exceeds the critical value , @xmath75 then the variance of the phenotype distribution grows linearly with @xmath76 . in both cases , numerical integration of the deterministic equation shows that the gaussian distribution is always stable and the phenotype distribution is always uni - modal , a consequence of the random mating .",
    "the factors determining the transition into a multi - modal distribution can be understood in a simpler way if we assume that the range of phenotype space is finite , for instance @xmath77 , and assume that the deterministic equation ( eq .  ( [ sde_specific ] ) without the noise term ) satisfies periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the competition function , @xmath78 , the assortment function , @xmath9 , and the offspring distribution will be assumed to be periodic functions of period @xmath79 . since there is now no need for the function @xmath6 to regulate the competition process at large @xmath15 , we set @xmath80 . while the periodic boundary condition assumption is biologically unrealistic",
    ", we expect it to have a small impact when the scales of the competition , mating and offspring distributions are all much smaller than the available region of phenotype space ( as determined by @xmath81 ) .",
    "under these conditions , the deterministic equation has a uniform solution @xmath82 constant .",
    "using the normalisation @xmath83 , one finds that @xmath84 . a linear stability analysis of the deterministic equation around the solution @xmath85 is performed in appendix  [ appfpe ] .",
    "this shows that the uniform solution is unstable if : @xmath86 for some @xmath87 , with @xmath88 and @xmath89 the fourier modes of the reproduction noise , the mating and the competition kernel , respectively . an equivalent expression to ( [ linearstab ] ) in a slightly different model",
    "was derived in  @xcite .    from the inequality ( [ linearstab ] )",
    "one can obtain the bifurcation diagram of the system that shows the regions of parameter space in which the deterministic equation [ eq .  ( [ detfield ] ) ] leads to patterns .",
    "figure  [ bifdia ] portrays several bifurcation diagrams for the case in which the ecological functions are uniform and gaussian functions ( projected onto the @xmath90 plane ) .",
    "the figure shows that phenotypic clusters are observed for low values of the reproduction noise @xmath91 and for intermediate values of the assortativity scale @xmath92 , in accordance with what was found in @xcite .",
    "intuitively , clusters tend to form with a distance , @xmath93 , between them so that they barely compete ( so @xmath94 ) , but these clusters will only be durable if individuals from different clusters do not mate ( so @xmath95 ) , suggesting that clusters will not form if @xmath96 .",
    "sexual reproduction tends to concentrate the phenotype distribution , so a moderate value of @xmath92 can promote the formation of clusters",

    "( for instance , spots and stripes ) , so individuals which react ( for example , compete ) and diffuse ( for example , mutate in trait or gene space ) may create patterns ( clusters ) .",
    "the traditional approach of the theoretical physicist would then be to construct a simple model to see if the effect appears , and if so , then see if a deeper understanding of the effect can be gained from an analysis of the model .",
    "this is the approach that we have adopted here .",
    "we have started from a simple model that only contained birth , death ( through competition ) and mutation , and asked under which conditions clusters of individuals in phenotype space were formed . as discussed in the introduction , this is a question which has been investigated by several authors , however our study focused on individuals who gave birth only after mating with another individual , whereas most previous investigations assumed asexual reproduction .",
    "we also investigated stochastic pattern formation  @xcite .",
    "most previous work was carried out in the case of infinite carrying capacity ( in our notation , @xmath136 ) where the governing equations are deterministic .",
    "the standard way of proceeding in this case is to look under what conditions the constant density ( homogeneous ) solution of this equation is unstable .",

    "these patterns typically are stochastic , and can be found by analysing the governing equations at finite carrying capacity , @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , the scaling of these patterns with @xmath5 has particular biological implications @xcite .",
    "the search for stochastic patterns in models of asexual reproduction has been carried out previously  @xcite .",
    "it was found that noise originating in the discrete nature of individuals can lead to the spontaneous formation of species in situations where this would not happen deterministically .",
    "the main purpose of this paper was to extend this to the case of sexual reproduction .",
    "we first supposed that individuals played both the male and female role ( i.e. were hermaphrodite ) .",
    "we found that when mating is assortative ( i.e. organisms show preference for like individuals ) stochastic patterns can appear in the region of stability of the deterministic homogeneous solution .",
    "these patterns were , however , somewhat restricted to parameter values not too far from the deterministic instability boundary . when mating is random the stochastic effects are stronger , and the phenotype distribution for moderate @xmath5 is always relatively narrow , in contrast with the deterministic predictions .",
    "the case where the individuals were either male or female led to very similar results , which in some cases could be mapped directly onto the the hermaphroditic case .",
    "there are several extensions of the current work which could be carried out .",
    "one could distinguish between `` genetic noise '' ( arising from recombination and mutations ) , which affects the inheritable traits , and `` environmental '' or `` developmental '' noise , which leads to two individuals with same genotype to have different phenotypes and which is not inherited .",
    "these two types of noise are likely to have rather different effects in the phenotype distribution .",
    "also , if a dominant part of the genetic noise is due to recombination , that is , the trait considered is determined by the effect of many genes in a diploid organism , and the effect of the different genes is additive ( no epistasis or dominance ) , then the noise should depend on the position in genotype space ( i.e. it would be multiplicative noise ) .",
    "multiplicative noise would break the spatial symmetry and could lead to interesting effects , but would be more difficult to study analytically .",
    "another possible extension is to include the allee effect , which we have here ignored for simplicity .",
    "we believe , however , that the work discussed here shows that the inclusion of stochastic effects is vital if we wish to predict the range of parameters for which patterns , and therefore possibly species , occur .",
