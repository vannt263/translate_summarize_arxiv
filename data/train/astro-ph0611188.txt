    "the need for a magnetic dynamo to produce and amplify the immense magnetic fields observed external to galaxies and in clusters of galaxies has long been recognized .",
    "the theory of kinematic magnetic dynamos has had a long history and is a well developed subject by now .",
    "there are numerous monographs and review articles devoted to the magnetic dynamos in astrophysics , some of which are : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "hundreds of papers on magnetic dynamos are published each year .",
    "three main astrophysical areas , in which dynamos are involved , are the generation of magnetic fields in the convective zones of planets and stars , in differentially rotating spiral galaxies , and in the accretion disks around compact objects .",
    "the possibility of production of magnetic fields in the central parts of the black hole accretion disks in agn has been pointed out by @xcite and the need and possibility for a robust dynamo by @xcite .",
    "dynamos have been also observed in the laboratory in the riga experiment @xcite and in karlsruhe experiment @xcite , although these flows only partially simulate astrophysical ones .",
    "the flow resulting in a dynamo is essentially three dimensional flow and often , especially under astrophysical circumstances , is a chaotic or turbulent flow .",
    "the shear in a rotating conducting fluid amplifies the magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the shear and facilitates the growth of the magnetic field .",
    "originally , @xcite proposed to combine the effects of kinetic helicity of the small scale motions of the fluid with the differential rotation to generate large scale magnetic fields in the sun . here",
    "we consider just such a dynamo in its application to the differentially rotating flow in the accretion disk around central massive black holes ( cmbh ) in the centers of galaxies .",
    "the necessary and robust source of helicity is provided by the rising and expanding plumes of the gas heated by the star passages through the accretion disk .",
    "this property of the rotation of expanding plumes in a rotating frame is discussed at length in the companion paper , @xcite , `` a magnetic @xmath3 dynamo in agn disks : i. the hydrodynamics of star - disk collisions and keplerian flow '' , which is referred to as paper  i. this natural and unique coherent flow is supported by experimental evidence @xcite and is fundamental to the origin of a robust dynamo in an agn accretion disk .    the magnetic dynamo in the disk is the essential part of the whole emerging picture of the formation and functioning of agns , closely related to the production of magnetic fields within galaxies , within clusters of galaxies , and the still greater energies and fluxes in the inter - galactic medium .",
    "black hole formation , rossby wave torquing of the accretion disk @xcite , jet formation @xcite and magnetic field redistribution by reconnection and flux conversion , and finally particle acceleration in the radio lobes and jets are the key parts of this scenario @xcite .",
    "finally we note that if almost every galaxy contains a cmbh and that if a major fraction of the free energy of its formation is converted into magnetic energy , then only a small fraction of this magnetic energy , as seen in the giant radio lobes @xcite , is sufficient to propose a possible feed back in structure formation and in galaxy formation .",
    "this work is arranged as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] we briefly overview the ingredients of the star - disk collisions dynamo with a brief review of the disk conditions and star disk collisions from paper  i. in section  [ sec3 ] we introduce the flux conversion dynamo analysis with a discussion of the necessary reconnection and turbulence driven resistivity . in section  [ sec4 ] the mean field theory is developed , in section  [ sec6 ] the dynamo equations and numerical method are developed , and in section  [ sec7 ] the results of numerical calculations are presented in support of all three approaches .",
    "finally , we end with the conclusions in section  [ sec_concl ] .",
    "cgs units are used throughout the paper .",
    "a poloidal magnetic field can be of two types distinguished by the reflectional symmetry in the equatorial plane : quadrupole ( or even ) and dipole ( or odd ) .",
    "quadrupole field has the same sign of the radial component above and below the disk plane .",
    "the radial component of the dipole field changes sign under the reflection in the disk plane , it vanishes exactly at the disk plane .",
    "rigourous definitions and properties of the odd and even fields are given in appendix  a. as is evident in figure  [ fig1a]a , the quadrupole field has a large radial component , both within and external to the disk and furthermore maintains the same radial direction in both spaces .",
    "on the other hand the differential shear of a dipole field , symmetric about the midplane and therefore with zero radial component , results in no winding of the flux within the disk and therefore no toroidal gain .",
    "various higher multipoles than the quadrupole have an alternating radial component as a function of radius and therefore a greater possibility of cancellation by reconnection .",
    "differential winding of a symmetric poloidal field by the keplerian flow results in a uniform toroidal field having the same direction over the disk height and within the disk , figure  [ fig1a]b .",
    "an @xmath4 deformation resulting in a large scale helicity , on the scale comparable to the radius of the disk , will transform toroidal field into poloidal field .",
    "this transformed field , or new poloidal flux must have the same polarity as the original poloidal flux .",
    "then the closure of the dynamo cycle demands that this transformed flux be merged or reconnected with the original poloidal flux in order that it is augmented and hence produce gain .",
    "if this transformed flux alternates in direction ( as would be the case for a dipole field across the thickness of a disk ) , then the merged flux will be averaged to near zero . only in the case of the quadrupole field",
    "is there a possibility of a coherent addition to the original poloidal field when the @xmath4 deformation , as produced by star - disk collisions , changes sign across the midplane and further rotates only @xmath5 radians .",
    "one notes that star collisions in the opposite , axial , direction equally contribute to the quadrupole poloidal flux . the toroidal field produced by the shear of differential rotation from the quadrupole field , ( figure  [ fig1a]b ) ,",
    "has opposite directions far above the surface of the disk from that inside the disk .",
    "the opposite direction of the toroidal field above the disk is not shown in these drawings , because , in addition to the dynamo , it presumes the formation of a force - free oppositely directed helix in the conducting half space above and below the disk .",
    "we have , however , predicted and calculated this force - free helix @xcite , and furthermore , as mentioned above , we associate partial dissipation of its free energy with the visible structure of agn jets . however , the magnitude of the quadrupole field in the region closer to the disk surface and to the midplane should be stronger ( as computations actually prove ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath4 deformation will primarily take the bottom portion of the quadrupole flux and convert it into radial flux above the disk plane directed in the same way as the upper portion of the quadrupole field , figure  [ fig1a]d .",
    "therefore , in the accretion disk dynamo , plumes from star - disk collisions entrain and rotate toroidal flux by @xmath6 radians , originating primarily from within the disk , figure  [ fig1a]c .",
    "furthermore these plumes terminate close to or not far above the surface of the disk , and so produce negligible rotation of flux not so displaced from the disk .",
    "we then expect this rotated flux , before rotating a further @xmath7 radians and so before self cancellation , to reconnect as loops of poloidal flux , figure  [ fig1a]d .",
    "these loops of flux now merge with the initial poloidal field , figure  [ fig1a]a , thereby completing the cycle . to proceed with the dynamo problem we need to utilize the following results from paper",
    "i :    1 .   the distribution of stars in coordinate and velocity space in the central star cluster of an agn .",
    "2 .   the velocity , and density of the plasma in the disk and in the corona of the disk .",
    "3 .   the hydrodynamics of the flow resulting from the passage of the star through the disk , the plumes .",
    "we review briefly the properties of the plumes produced by the star disk collisions as they relate to the dynamo . then with these results",
    "we estimate the conductivity in order to develop a flux rotation theory of the dynamo .",
    "let us first introduce a term which is used frequently below .",
    "because of high conductivity of the plasma considered in this paper , the magnetic field is close to a `` frozen - in '' state , when the magnetic field lines follow the motions of the plasma .",
    "imagine now a closed contour attached to the particles of plasma with some magnetic flux passing through this contour .",
    "let us also draw this contour such that it is close to being a plane contour . as the result of plasma motions ,",
    "this contour can be rotated by some angle .",
    "if this rotation happens quickly enough , so that no substantial magnetic field crosses the contour due to diffusion , the magnetic flux passing through this closed contour remains almost unchanged .",
    "the component of the magnetic field normal to the plane of the contour and averaged over the surface of the closed contour should have rotated by the same angle as the contour .",
    "we will name this process `` flux rotation '' .",
    "we describe the number density of central stellar cluster and the kinematics of the stellar orbits in paper  i. the most important result of this consideration is that the rate at which stars cross the unit area of the disk surface peaks at a radial distance of about @xmath8 to @xmath9 from the cmbh , where @xmath10 is the gravitational radius of the cmbh and @xmath11 is the mass @xmath12 of the cmbh expressed in units of @xmath13 solar masses : @xmath14 .",
    "the rate of stars - disk collisions closer to the cmbh than @xmath8 is depleted because of the tidal destruction of stars in the gravitational field of cmbh and because of the grinding of the star orbits into the accretion disk plane .",
    "this grinding occurs because of the action of a drag , which every star experiences on its passage through the accretion disk .",
    "after many passages this drag causes an inclined keplerian orbit of a star to become coplanar with the disk plane and this star becomes trapped inside the disk .",
    "the physics and dynamics of a star - disk collision is also considered in paper  i. here we briefly summarize the results of paper  i for the convenience of the reader . a star collides with the disk at a typical velocity of @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the velocity of escape from the surface of a solar like star is @xmath17 .",
    "this is one order of magnitude smaller than the velocity of the star moving through the gas in the accretion disk .",
    "also , the sound speed in the accretion disk at a radial distance of @xmath18 is @xmath19 ( see appendix  a in paper  i for details and more accurate numbers ) .",
    "therefore , the gravitational field of the star itself does not influence a highly supersonic flow of gas onto the star . in this regard ,",
    "the physics of a star - disk collision is radically different from the physics of the classical accretion process on either the moving or the resting star .",
    "the classical theory of accretion of interstellar gas with zero angular momentum onto stars was developed in @xcite .",
    "since the peculiar velocities of stars in the galaxy are much less than @xmath17 and the sound speed in the interstellar material is also much less than @xmath17 , the gravitational potential of a star dominates the dynamics of the accretion flow in the near proximity of a star .",
    "the radius of the gravitational capture of the gas is much larger than the radius of the star .",
    "captured gas falls almost radially down to the star surface .",
    "the presence of a small asymmetry or non - homogeneity of the surrounding gas causes nonzero angular momentum , which strongly influence the dynamics of the accretion flow below the gravitational capture radius .",
    "the term `` collision '' rather than `` accretion '' is much more appropriate for the description of the interaction of a passing star with the accretion disk . because of the high velocity of the star , the cross section of the interaction of a star with the gas is equal to the geometric cross section of a star .",
    "the high ram pressure of the incoming stream with the density @xmath20 to @xmath21 strips away the outer layer of a star .",
    "the underlying layers with the temperature @xmath22 and density @xmath23 are exposed .",
    "this picture is completely different from the physics of the mixing of the radial accretion stream with the stellar ( solar ) atmosphere in the classical accretion theory as described by @xcite .",
    "a radiation shock is formed in front of the star and the channel of the hot gas is left behind the star .",
    "this channel expands sideways inside the accretion disk and heats the surrounding gas .",
    "the hot gas is subject to buoyancy force acting away from the equatorial plane of the disk . as a result of this force ,",
    "two plumes rising from the two sides of the accretion disk are formed at the location of the star - disk crossing .",
    "note , that the amount of gas in the rising plumes and the size of the plumes are much larger than the initial mass and size of the hot channel made by the star .",
    "as explained in paper  i , the plume should expand to several times its original radius by the time it reaches the height of the order @xmath24 above the disk surface , where @xmath25 is the semi - thickness of the disk .",
    "the corresponding increase in the moment of inertia of the plume and the conservation of the angular momentum of the plume causes the plume to rotate slower relative to the inertial frame . from the viewpoint of the observer in the frame corotating with the keplerian flow at the radius of the disk at the location of the plume",
    ", this means that the plume rotates in the direction opposite to the keplerian rotation with an angular velocity equal to some fraction of the local keplerian angular velocity depending upon the radial expansion ratio .",
    "since the expansion of the plume will not be infinite in the rise and fall time of @xmath7 radians of keplerian rotation of the disk , we expect that the average of the plume rotation will be correspondingly less , or @xmath26 or @xmath6 radians .",
    "any force or frictional drag that resists this rotation will be countered by the coriolis force .",
    "finally we note that kinetic helicity is proportional to    @xmath27    for the dynamo one requires one additional dynamic property of the plumes .",
    "this is , that the total rotation angle must be finite and preferably @xmath28 radians , otherwise a larger angle or after many turns the vector of the entrained magnetic field would average to a small value and consequently the dynamo growth rate would be correspondingly small .",
    "this property of finite rotation , @xmath29 radians , is a natural property of plumes produced above a keplerian disk .",
    "thus we have derived the approximate properties of an accretion disk around a massive black hole : the high probability of star - disk collisions , the three necessary properties of the resulting plumes all necessary for a robust dynamo .",
    "what is missing from this description is the necessary electrical properties of the medium .",
    "the dynamos producing large scale magnetic fields require a compromise between high and low conductivity . a poor conductor or",
    "an insulator will not allow the field to be dragged with the motion of the medium .",
    "ohmic dissipation will cause the magnetic field to decay , and if sufficiently rapid , no dynamo will be possible . in the limit of very high conductivity ,",
    "kinematic exponential growth of magnetic field has been predicted to occur in the presence of random or chaotic three dimensional motions of the medium ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the problem with analytic three dimensional motions is that being described as kinematic , they are reversible in the sense that little or no entropy is generated by the motions themselves",
    ". the field can be unwrapped by a `` non - maxwell '' demon following the line of force .",
    "since the `` demon '' does not have to `` throw away '' any information in following the reverse path , no entropy is generated .",
    "the chaotic behavior in time of kinematic mathematically reversible motions does not create entropy because of time reversal invariance of the equations .",
    "the plumes from star disk collisions indeed occur randomly in time , but since the initial state is as random as the final state , no entropy is generated just due to the randomness in time of the plumes themselves . by comparison ,",
    "if the initial state were a large amplitude coherent wave , then phase scrambling would indeed alter the entropy , but by a relatively small amount compared to a scattering process that leads to a maxwell distribution .",
    "this lack of a change in entropy is then equivalent to laminar flow ( without molecular diffusion ) where mixing is reversible .",
    "by contrast , the randomness created by fluid turbulence is irreversible , satisfying a principle of maximizing the dissipation of the free energy of shear flow in a fluid . the plumes ,",
    "although random in time , result in a coherent addition of poloidal flux , because every plume translates axially , expands radially , and rotates through nearly the same angle , @xmath6 , for every plume .",
    "the negative effect of turbulence on dynamo gain has been documented in three major liquid sodium dynamo experiments : lyon , cadarache  @xcite , maryland @xcite , and madison @xcite , all using the similar flow configurations .",
    "numerous theoretical simulations of these flows , the dudley - james flow in a sphere  @xcite or similar von krmn flow in a cylinder ( i.e. , two counter - rotating radially converging and axially diverging flows ) in the kinematic or laminar limit have been performed : ( lyon , cadarache ) @xcite , ( maryland ) @xcite , and ( madison ) @xcite .",
    "they all predict exponential dynamo gain at a critical magnetic reynolds numbers , @xmath30 . yet the experiments give a null result , i.e. , no exponential dynamo gain for experimental flows where @xmath31 are achieved in the experiments .",
    "these null results are interpreted as due to the negative effects of turbulent diffusion @xcite .",
    "our generalized interpretation of these results is that turbulence behaves as an enhanced diffusion of magnetic flux or an enhanced resistivity @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the turbulent velocity @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average shear velocity @xcite",
    ". then the turbulence leads to a decreased conductivity or an enhanced resistivity as described by @xcite as : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the conductivity of the fluid , @xmath36 is the magnetic diffusivity of the same fluid , and @xmath37 is the effective conductivity in the presence of turbulence .",
    "the constant @xmath38 is derived from mean - field electrodynamics assuming isotropic turbulence : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mean correlation time of a turbulent fluctuation . since the correlation time is an eddy turn over time , then @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an eddy size .",
    "we then identify @xmath43 as a turbulent diffusion coefficient and the turbulent conductivity becomes the original conductivity decreased by the factor @xmath44 . in the limit of a large @xmath45 ,",
    "the effective magnetic diffusivity then becomes just the turbulent diffusivity , @xmath46 .",
    "it is the combination of turbulent diffusivity with fluid resistivity or equivalently , effective restivity that determines dynamo gain . in unconstrained flows",
    "@xmath42 becomes the dimension of the largest eddy that can `` fit '' in the flow or @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dimension of the shear flow .",
    "this larger effective resistivity then results in a smaller effective magnetic reynolds number that determines dynamo exponential gain , @xmath49 for a given @xmath33 and @xmath48 . since @xmath50 , then @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this value of @xmath53 is significantly smaller than the predicted value of @xmath54 for the dudley - james or von krmn flows used in the current major experiments .",
    "it is even smaller than @xmath55 for ponomarenko flow used in riga dynamo experiment @xcite .    the critical threshold for dynamo gain ,",
    "@xmath56 is determined from kinematic dynamo calculations without enhanced turbulent resistivity . for bounded sheared flows , namely except for all but these special flows mentioned above , @xmath57 .",
    "the question is whether there can be any exponential dynamo gain in any unconstrained shear flows .    by way of confirmation , in the two dynamo experiments that have demonstrated positive exponential dynamo gain , the riga experiment @xcite and the karlsruhe experiment @xcite , turbulence was greatly constrained by the presence of a ridged wall(s ) separating the counter flowing shear flows .",
    "it was therefore well recognized that these experiments did not represent astrophysical dynamos , but , on the other hand , strongly confirmed dynamo theory .",
    "we were therefore convinced that a natural constraint of turbulence must exist for the dynamos of astrophysics .",
    "there are at least five constraints of turbulence in shear flow that may alter the magnitude of turbulence as well as its isotropy .",
    "we list five of these constraints , expecting others to be identified :    1 .   viscosity .",
    "2 .   a ridged wall .",
    "3 .   a positive outward gradient of angular momentum .",
    "4 .   a gradient of entropy in a gravitational field ( e.g. , the base of the convection zone of stars ) .",
    "delay in the onset of fully developed turbulence in unconstrained shear flow .",
    "viscosity may inhibit all turbulence so that in this limit the properties of turbulence are not relevant .",
    "a ridged wall affects the magnitude of turbulence and its isotropy ( the law of the walls ) .",
    "the gradients of angular momentum and entropy apply to astrophysical circumstances , where depending upon the presence of other instabilities , e.g. the magnetorotational instability or rossby vortex instability , turbulence may be a small fraction of the average shear flow .",
    "time dependence is similar to viscosity , in the case where the initiation time of the shear flow may be very short compared to the development time of the turbulence as in the case of the plumes driven by star - disk collisions .",
    "this limit leads to negligible levels of turbulence compared to the shear flow .",
    "we chose a gradient of angular momentum and time dependence of the shear flow , e.g. , plume flow , as the probable mechanisms of constraint of turbulence for the most likely circumstances for producing an astrophysical dynamo ; angular momentum as the circumstance for the accretion in massive black hole formation , and time dependence for the constraint of the transient period of the rise and fall of plumes in astrophysical circumstances .",
    "it is with this uncertainty of the role of turbulence in dissipating the magnetic flux as opposed to amplifying it that the current work was undertaken .",
    "hence , when we found the possibility of a combination of ( a ) , a near laminar shear flow , keplerian flow , and ( b ) , a repeatable , transient , non - turbulent source of helicity , could the possibility of a robust astrophysical dynamo become evident .",
    "although the star - disk collisions are random in time , the flow , to first order is repeatable and therefore not turbulent .",
    "the flow resulting from a superposition of many plumes may be chaotic in time , but the superposition of many plumes , all with the same rotation , leads to a net rotated flux in the same direction . on the other hand , the vortices in anisotropic turbulence make an arbitrary number of turns and so the instantaneous mean value of rotated flux is proportional to the square root of the number of vortices .",
    "thus we characterize the plumes as semi - coherent rather than a truly chaotic phenomena in which the entropy would be increased . in addition",
    "we discuss next the analysis in which turbulence may augment or possibly limit the `` fast dynamo '' .",
    "the dynamos with non - vanishing growth rate in the limit of very high conductivity are called fast dynamos @xcite .",
    "a classical picture of the fast dynamo mechanism is stretch - twist - fold process @xcite .",
    "there are strong indications that the fast dynamo action is typical for chaotic flows @xcite .",
    "however , in the kinematic stage of the dynamo , a sharp exponential decrease in some spatial scales of the magnetic field occurs .",
    "the magnetic field becomes concentrated in the narrow sheets or narrow filaments until the frozen - in picture becomes invalid for any conductivity .",
    "in the kinematic limit the thickness of these structures of strong magnetic field is estimated as @xmath58 , where the magnetic reynolds number , @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the velocity of the conducting fluid , @xmath48 is the characteristic dimension of the fluid , and @xmath61 is magnetic diffusivity due to finite resistivity .",
    "the growth of small scale fields invalidates the kinematic approximation beginning with the resistive scale and up to the larger scales . the structure and the spectrum of this , hydromagnetic",
    ", turbulent dynamo is expected to be different from the hydrodynamic turbulence because of the action of the magnetic forces .",
    "the size @xmath62 of the smallest magnetic structures depends on the details and properties of the hydromagnetic regime of the turbulence , which are still the subject of active debate in the literature @xcite , but is always much smaller than the large scale @xmath48 by some positive power of @xmath63 . in the limit of infinite conductivity , no flux can merge in an infinite time and hence , there can be no multiplication of flux at a scale of the system ( large scale ) . the motions with nonzero helicity @xmath64 at a large scale and the ability to reconnect",
    "is required to obtain the growth of the large scale fields and magnetic flux comparable to the growth rate of the small scale field .",
    "when the large scale field growth is at a rate comparable to the growth rate of the small scale field , the characteristic growth time is of order of the diffusion time @xmath65 .    yet our ionized disk of thickness @xmath66 , velocity @xmath67 and resistivity @xmath68 at 1  ev @xmath69 temperature , results in @xmath70",
    "this is a number so large as to preclude useful growth of the magnetic flux and the large scale fields in a hubble time , which is much shorter than the diffusion time of the magnetic field @xmath71 .    only by invoking the phenomena of turbulent resistivity , ( above )",
    "can the existence of an accretion disk dynamo producing large scale magnetic fields be made convincing .",
    "turbulent resistivity within the disk is likely to be due to the same turbulence that creates the @xmath4-viscosity of the shakura ",
    "sunyaev disk or the rossby vortices of the rvi disk . within the disk we expect turbulent diffusion of the magnetic flux to be the same as that of angular momentum , and thus proportional to the shakura ",
    "sunyaev parameter @xmath72 ( see paper  ) .",
    "reconnection may be occurring within the turbulence leading to more rapid dissipation of the magnetic flux than the turbulent cascade alone .",
    "however , the force - free fields above ( and below ) the disk that are produced by the winding of the dynamo - produced large scale fields need not be dissipated until they are projected large distances away from the disk .    recognizing this lack of fundamental understanding , but that laboratory and astrophysical observations lead to the same order of magnitude for reconnection",
    ", we proceed with the assumption that a value of @xmath73 approximates the magnetic diffusion within the disk . in what follows",
    "this parameter could be several orders of magnitude larger , but not much smaller and still result in an effective accretion disk dynamo .      with these values of plume size , frequency , and magnetic diffusivity as well as keplerian flow ,",
    "let us make some estimates of the threshold parameters and the growth rate of the @xmath3 dynamo , which has been outlined in a previous section .",
    "the approach developed below , in the rest of section  [ sec3 ] , we call the flux rotation dynamo as opposed to the mean field dynamo",
    ". later we will compare these approaches with emphasis upon the difference between coherent motions versus random averaged variables .",
    "we consider for now the linear growth , i.e. when the magnetic field is not strong enough , such that one can neglect the back reaction of the generated magnetic field on both the keplerian flow and on the plume flow fields .",
    "suppose that at some moment of time we have an even symmetry poloidal magnetic field , @xmath74 ( see appendix  [ appendix_c ] for definitions of even and odd symmetries ) .",
    "the radial component of this field within the disk defines a poloidal flux , @xmath75 , such that at a given radius @xmath76 , the poloidal flux through one half of the disk , either side of the mid - plane , is @xmath77 , where @xmath25 is a semi - thickness of the disk .",
    "this flux , within the conducting and differentially rotating keplerian disk , will be wrapped up into a toroidal magnetic field within the disk , @xmath78 .",
    "this toroidal field will be stronger or a multiple of the initial poloidal field depending upon the number of turns and the resistive dissipation of the currents .",
    "initially we consider no dissipation so that an initial flux line of poloidal magnetic field @xmath79 will be differentially wrapped @xmath80 times around the axis leading to an enhanced @xmath78 .",
    "let us introduce the number of differential turns , @xmath80 , that occurs at a radial distance , @xmath76 , during time , @xmath81 , as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the keplerian angular velocity of the disk .",
    "we consider the toroidal flux , @xmath84 , in the azimuthal direction and within the half thickness of the disk , @xmath25 : @xmath85 .",
    "then , the increment of this toroidal flux added to the original @xmath84 per @xmath86 and per @xmath87 differential turns becomes @xmath88 since @xmath89 , this is equivalent to @xmath90 .",
    "if we integrate over @xmath87 and integrate over @xmath86 to give the change in toroidal flux , @xmath91 , per revolution we obtain an estimate @xmath92 the poloidal flux , @xmath75 , in turn is derived from the toroidal flux by the helicity , @xmath64 , of the plumes driven by star - disk collisions .",
    "each plume lifts a loop of toroidal flux with cross section @xmath93 , fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , where @xmath94 is the radius of the shock produced by a star ( see paper  i for details ) .",
    "the small distortion @xmath95 from the circular cross section is neglected .",
    "when this unit of area or flux is rotated @xmath5 radians into the poloidal direction with an efficiency of a single plume , @xmath96 , it creates an equal unit of poloidal flux @xmath97 inside the disk .",
    "the top parts of the field loops created by the plumes are rising quickly because of the low density of plasma in the corona : even a very weak magnetic field can overcome the gravity acting on a rarefied gas and the expansion will be at a relativistic alfvn speed @xmath98 . also , the shearing of the top part of the loops is small , so the toroidal field produced is also small .",
    "the rate of this removal of the toroidal and poloidal fields from above the disk to the magnetized jet is higher than the diffusion feeding from the inside of the disk , if @xmath99 .",

    "each plume exists for the time @xmath115 before falling back to the disk surface .",
    "then in the spirit of a flux rotation explanation of the dynamo we evaluate the fractional contribution to the total poloidal flux by each rotated plume .",
    "the plumes occur randomly over the area of the disk , but their contribution to the average flux of either poloidal of toroidal is independent of position on the surface , because the coherence of the plume rotation ensures an effect proportional to the algebraic sum of the number of plumes regardless of their location",
    ". therefore we can rearrange , gedanken - wise , the location of the plumes over the disk without affecting the result .",
    "we therefore rearrange and align a fraction of the plumes , @xmath107 in number , to create a single , continuous poloidal flux tube of poloidal flux , @xmath116 , and length @xmath76 where @xmath117 .",
    "we have enough plumes , @xmath112 , to create @xmath118 such flux tubes .",
    "these poloidal flux tubes of width @xmath24 then collectively cover a fraction in azimuth or a sector of angular width of @xmath119 and produce a poloidal flux per half revolution of @xmath120 one can express @xmath121 from equation  ( [ eqn3.31 ] ) as @xmath122 we then note that @xmath123 by construction , and therefore the poloidal flux created by @xmath112 plumes per half revolution becomes @xmath124 we define a parameter @xmath125 as @xmath126 to give @xmath127 per revolution . here",
    "@xmath125 becomes an efficiency for the rotation of toroidal flux into poloidal flux per radian of revolution and averaged over all the plumes .",
    "then the time derivative considering two plumes per keplerian period becomes @xmath128    similarly from equation  ( [ eqn3.30 ] ) we obtain @xmath129 because one keplerian revolution , @xmath130 , corresponds to @xmath131 differential turns according to expression  ( [ eqn_ndiff ] ) .",
    "in addition we must consider the fractional flux cancellation of each of these two flux transformations .",
    "this leads to partial cancellation of each orthogonal component by the other and to partial self cancellation as well .",
    "finally second order effects , as well as the different dissipation rates of the two fluxes must be considered .",
    "these effects are usually averaged in mean - field theory , but here we consider them separately , because we are concerned with a semi - coherent flow as opposed to a turbulent dynamo .",
    "we considered above that the flux is frozen within the disk fluid flow .",
    "now we consider the relaxation of this condition by resistive diffusion or reconnection .",
    "resistive dissipation of the currents supporting these fields limits the growth of toroidal field . here",
    "we consider the saturation of the toroidal multiplication alone with a fixed poloidal field . after many turns ,",
    "this additional toroidal magnetic field reaches a saturation value determined by the balance of the multiplication rate with resistive diffusion .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field changes fastest in the vertical direction on the scale @xmath25 , therefore the dissipation rate is estimated as @xmath132 where magnetic reynolds number with respect to keplerian rotation is defined as @xmath133 if we add this loss to the gain of equation  ( [ eqn3.35 ] ) , we then have @xmath134 thus the toroidal field saturates after @xmath135 turns . in view of equation  ( [ eqn3.36 ] ) the limiting , steady state is achieved when @xmath136 this limiting value of the ratio @xmath137 can be measured separately in the laboratory ( in @xmath138 geometry ) , without the motions producing the @xmath4-effect of the complete dynamo , by applying an external , fixed poloidal initial field .",
    "the same situation may apply to the galaxy if a small residual poloidal flux is left over from the initial agn phase , i.e. , this dynamo , and therefore no further dynamo in the galactic disk would be required , even though one likely exists @xcite .",
    "furthermore this ratio represents the maximum possible toroidal multiplication that should off set losses in the rotation of toroidal flux back into poloidal flux for achieving net positive dynamo growth rate .",
    "thus if the toroidal amplification is large , the efficiency of rotation of toroidal flux back into poloidal flux , @xmath125 , can be small , and the dynamo will still be growing .    to this toroidal multiplication and resistive loss",
    "we must add the back reaction effects of the helicity or flux rotation mechanism(s ) , of the `` @xmath125-effect '' .      in order to calculate @xmath125 of equation  ( [ eqn3.f_t ] ) ,",
    "we require both @xmath110 and @xmath96 .",
    "the coverage factor , @xmath110 , is more straight forward to estimate from the star disk collision rate and plume size , but the efficiency of the helical deformation by a single plume  ( [ eqn3.28 ] ) is more problematic .",
    "the simplest and ideal concept of poloidal flux production by a plume is that a plume of radius @xmath139 rises a distance @xmath140 above the disk with entrapped flux , @xmath141 , rotates this flux exactly @xmath142 radians , i.e. , into the poloidal direction , falls back , merges with the disk matter , and releases this now poloidal flux by diffusion or reconnection so that this unit of poloidal flux adds in the same direction , i.e. coherently , to @xmath75 .",
    "of course this sequence of rotation , rise , fall , and merging of the fluxes will happen episodically and only when averaged , leads to the factor @xmath125 such that @xmath143 per revolution ( equation  ( [ eqn3.f_t ] ) ) .",
    "the associated experimental paper , @xcite , on laboratory measurements of plume rotation implies that a rising and expanding plume , in a rotating frame , indeed rotates a finite angle @xmath144 radians before merging with the background fluid . in this case",
    "the finite angle of rotation occurs for the same reason as expected in the accretion disk . in the laboratory case",
    "the velocity of the plume relative to the velocity of rotation is chosen such that the plume is destroyed or broken up by striking the end wall of the apparatus in a chosen finite fraction of a period of rotation . in an accretion disk ,",
    "as pointed out earlier , the plume indeed rises and falls in @xmath7 radians with the rotation angle as well as the merging with background disk material , both increasing monotonically during this rise and fall time . hence the ideal angle , @xmath5 radians , occurs as a result of the product and average of the three progressive deformations , but most importantly throughout the entire sequence the incremental addition to @xmath125 is always positive .",
    "also one should note that with each plume there is an equal upward vertical flux , @xmath145 , as downward vertical flux , @xmath146 , which presumably averages to zero with flux merging .",
    "as described in equations  ( [ eqn3.33 ] ) and  ( [ eqn3.f_t ] ) the number of plumes adding to the poloidal flux is described by the filling factor , @xmath110 , of the disk by plumes , where @xmath147 .",
    "the average number of plumes on one side of the disk within a radius @xmath76 at any given time is approximately equal to the number of stars with impact radii inside @xmath76 , @xmath112 , given by expression  ( 2 ) in paper  i.    @xmath25 is given by expression  ( 6 ) in paper  i , valid for the inner zone  ( a ) of a standard or shakura  sunyaev disk .",
    "the reader is referred to paper  i for the details , arguments and caveats of using this model of an accretion disk originally proposed by @xcite and further developed in @xcite . here",
    "we only remark that we use the expressions for the disk parameters valid for @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the transition radius between zones ( a ) , ( radiation dominated ) and ( b ) , ( particle pressure dominate ) generally a few hundreds of @xmath150 . as we see from expression  ( [ sc_eqn3.44 ] ) below ,",

    "there the force - free approximation @xmath279 describes the magnetic field evolution at @xmath280 . in the particular case @xmath281 the force - free magnetic field satisfies the vacuum equation @xmath282 .",
    "@xcite investigated the @xmath273 turbulent dynamo in accretion disks with linear force - free coronae .",
    "they match axisymmetric solutions of the dynamo equations  ( [ eqn3.50 ] ) and  ( [ eqn3.51 ] ) inside the disk to the solutions with constant @xmath283 of a force - free equation @xmath284 outside the disk .",
    "they find that the results for the dynamo eigenvalues and dynamo eigenmodes do not change significantly with the value of @xmath283 .",
    "the @xmath4-quenched saturated mode also depends weekly on @xmath283 .",
    "thus , in order to obtain estimates for the star - disk collisions driven dynamo we can assume that @xmath281 and the magnetic fields obey the vacuum condition @xmath282 outside the disk .",
    "note , however , that some of the poloidal magnetic field lines obtained in @xcite have inclination angles to the surface of the accretion disk less than @xmath285 .",
    "this means that mhd outflow should start along these poloidal magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "the presence of the mhd outflow would make the force - free approximation invalid .",
    "however , these field lines , although radial initially , after many turns become wrapped up into a force - free helix where the radial magnetic field becomes smaller than either the external poloidal or toroidal fields . both these external fields , in turn are smaller than the toroidal field inside the disk @xcite .",
    "since the magnetic field inside the disk is much stronger than outside the disk , the boundary condition at the top of the plume zone , @xmath286 , can be approximated as on the boundary with the vacuum : @xmath287 and @xmath288 .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for the @xmath273 dynamo in the thin slab @xmath289 with the vacuum outside the slab ( @xcite ) can be reduced to solving a one - dimensional eigenvalue problem in the @xmath235-coordinate . in this way ,",
    "the local growth rate of the dynamo @xmath290 is obtained .",
    "the growth rate of the global mode @xmath195 is very close to the maximum value of @xmath291 over the disk radius .",
    "the corresponding eigenmode is localized in the ring of the disk near radius @xmath292 .",
    "the characteristic radial width of the eigenmode for the dynamo numbers , that do not much exceed the threshold limit , is @xmath293 @xcite .",
    "the most easily excited mode of the dynamo has quadrupole symmetry and is steady .",
    "the excitation condition of this most easily excited mode is @xmath294 for the vertical dependence of the @xmath4-coefficient @xmath254 @xcite .",
    "the excitation condition varies somewhat depending on the choice of the profile of the @xmath4-coefficient but is of the same order as for the linear profile of @xmath4 . the growth rate of the most easily excited steady state quadrupole mode not far from the excitation threshold is @xmath295 the growth rate for large dynamo numbers , @xmath296 , or for small @xmath61 is @xmath297    this differs from eq .",
    "( [ eqn3.41a ] ) by a negligible factor , @xmath298 , for @xmath299 , in view of the many approximations .",
    "we therefore conclude that mean field dynamo theory results in a similar growth rate to that predicted by the flux rotation analysis . in either case",
    "the growth is so rapid in view of eq .",
    "( [ eqn3.45 ] ) that nearly the entire history of the accretion disk dynamo will be dominated by the near steady state saturated conditions .",
    "unfortunately this steady state is beyond the scope of the present paper where instead we feel satisfied in demonstrating an understanding of the dynamo gain using a flux rotation model , a mean field theory , and numerical simulations .",
    "we see that the filling factor @xmath300 is crucial for the mean field dynamo .",
    "let us estimate @xmath300 .",
    "the cross section area of the plume is @xmath301 , the number of plumes present at any moment of time on one side of the disk is @xmath302 .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath303 using expression  ( 16 ) of paper  i for the flux of stars , @xmath304 , and expression  ( a5 ) of paper  i for the disk half - thickness , one obtains @xmath305    the ratio of the toroidal to the poloidal or radial magnetic field in the growing mode and inside the volume occupied by plumes is @xmath306 using expression  ( [ q_differ ] ) for the value of @xmath267 one has @xmath307    as in all @xmath3 dynamos , the generated toroidal field is larger than the poloidal field .",
    "however , the toroidal field in the vacuum outside the region of dynamo activity vanishes , because the normal component of the current at the vacuum boundary must be zero . if there is conductivity , as we expect , and therefore force - free magnetic field above the plume region , then the toroidal magnetic field generated by the dynamo penetrates into this region @xcite .",
    "however , due to the quadrupole symmetry of the poloidal magnetic field , the toroidal field in the force - free corona has the opposite direction from the toroidal field inside the disk .",
    "the axial component of the magnetic field , @xmath308 , is much smaller than the radial component inside the slab occupied by plumes , @xmath309 .",
    "however , the radial component of the magnetic field decreases down to the value comparable to @xmath308 at @xmath310 . the quadrupole poloidal field in the corona is weaker than the poloidal magnetic field inside the disk by the factor @xmath311 .",
    "the structure of the force - free corona above the dynamo generation region can not be determined without further knowledge about boundary conditions at the outer boundaries of the force - free region or physical processes , which limit the applicability of force - free ideal mhd approximation in the corona ( i.e. , fast reconnection of magnetic fields ) .",
    "if one requires that the magnetic field in the force - free region vanishes for @xmath312 , as @xcite assume , then , the toroidal magnetic field is comparable to the poloidal field in the corona . in this case",
    ", the toroidal magnetic field in the force - free corona is much smaller than the toroidal magnetic field inside the disk , and so we neglect it in the simulations . in the actual case of the black hole accretion disk dynamo , we expect the coronal field to be force - free and to progressively remove the flux and magnetic energy generated by the dynamo in a force - free helix as described in @xcite where the field strength , as discussed above , is of the order of the poloidal field .",
    "because of limited numerical resolution and limited computing time we can not attempt to directly simulate the dynamo problem for the real astrophysical parameters .",
    "three dimensional simulations of just one star passage through the accretion disk is already quite a challenge for computational gas dynamics . even if we assume that we know the velocity field for a single star - disk collision and treat only the kinematic dynamo problem , the existence of @xmath313 plumes , the necessity of good resolution in the space between and above the plumes , and long evolution times required by the dynamo problem make the direct computations very difficult and demanding of major computer resources .",
    "numerical modeling done in this work illustrates and proves essential features of the star - disk collisions dynamo described above .",
    "we simulate the kinematic dynamo with only a few plumes present and adopt a simplified flow model for individual plumes .",
    "then , we compare the numerical growth rate and magnetic field structure to the predictions of flux rotation and mean field theories extrapolated to a small number of plumes .",
    "qualitative agreement between all three approaches in the limit of only a few plumes is observed .",
    "we have computed order of magnitude estimates of the growth rate and threshold for the dynamo by direct numerical simulations . for that purpose",
    "we have written a 3d kinematic dynamo code evolving the vector potential @xmath314 of the magnetic field in a given velocity field @xmath315 and with resistive diffusion .",
    "the code is written in cylindrical geometry .",
    "we start with the equations describing the evolution of fields in nonrelativistic quasineutral plasmas .",
    "@xmath316 where @xmath317 is the conductivity of the plasma .",
    "because we are considering the kinematic dynamo , @xmath318 is specified and the momentum equation is ignored . substituting the expression for the current @xmath319 from the equation  ( [ eqn9 ] ) into ohm s law , equation  ( [ eqn10 ] ) , and introducing a coefficient of magnetic diffusivity @xmath61 as @xmath320",
    "we obtain ohm s law in the form @xmath321 subject to the constraint ( [ eqn7 ] ) .",
    "the conventional and widely accepted way of writing and solving the kinematic mhd equations ( mhd without the hydrodynamical part ) is to obtain a single equation for the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "substitution of the electric field @xmath322 from the equation  ( [ eqn11 ] ) into faraday s law , equation ( [ eqn8 ] ) , results in @xmath323 introducing the vector potential @xmath324 with @xmath325 equation ( [ eqn12 ] ) takes the form @xmath326 where @xmath327 is the scalar potential ; no gauge has been chosen .",
    "any solution of equation ( [ eqn13 ] ) satisfying the boundary and initial conditions for the magnetic field should give a physical result for the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "the equation ( [ eqn13 ] ) has the same second order in space derivatives as equation ( [ eqn12 ] ) for the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "the gauge freedom can be used to simplify the procedure for solving equation ( [ eqn13 ] ) .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath327 may be chosen to be an arbitrary function by an appropriate choice of gauge transformation .",
    "for instance , one can choose to set @xmath328 , in which case the remaining equation for @xmath314 takes the form @xmath329 the boundary conditions for @xmath314 should be consistent with the gauge chosen . in principle , equation  ( [ eqn19 ] ) requires three separate boundary conditions for the components of @xmath330 .",
    "this number is the same as the number of boundary conditions required to solve the equation for the evolution of the magnetic field  ( [ eqn12 ] ) .",
    "note , however , that there is still a freedom to add @xmath331 to @xmath314 and therefore to the boundary conditions for @xmath314 , where @xmath332 is an arbitrary time independent function , and still preserve the gauge condition @xmath328 .",
    "although any arbitrary initialization of @xmath314 satisfying the boundary conditions can be allowed , many initializations would result in the same magnetic field @xmath333 .",
    "initializing eq .",
    "( [ eqn12 ] ) @xmath334 is formally required .",
    "we have the following requirements for the boundary and initial conditions for @xmath314 :    1 .   there must be boundary and initial conditions on all three components of @xmath335 .",
    "2 .   boundary and initial conditions should be consistent with the gauge used .",
    "the physical boundary conditions and the initial conditions for the magnetic and electric fields ( or any other quantities ) specific to a particular problem must be satisfied .",
    "the last requirement means that the physical boundary conditions must be derivable from the boundary conditions equations imposed on @xmath314 .",
    "the reverse is not necessarily true , i.e. for one specific physical boundary conditions there may be many possible boundary conditions for @xmath314 .",
    "the situation with the boundary conditions for @xmath314 is analogous to the situation with the initial conditions for @xmath314 . with this specification of initial and boundary conditions ,",
    "the curl of the solution to equation  ( [ eqn13 ] ) will be equal to the solution of equation  ( [ eqn12 ] ) .",
    "if one chooses to evolve the magnetic field directly , then in addition to the equation of evolution  ( [ eqn12 ] ) the magnetic field must obey the constraint @xmath336 , which should be specified as an initial condition .",
    "although it follows from ( [ eqn12 ] ) that , once initialized to zero , @xmath337 will be kept equal to zero , the numerical methods used to solve ( [ eqn12 ] ) introduce discretization errors , which after a sufficient time can accumulate so that @xmath337 is no longer zero ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "special procedures are employed in the codes to deal with this problem such as `` divergence cleaning '' . however , in the case of the evolution of the vector potential there are three equations  ( [ eqn13 ] ) to solve , while there are four dynamic variables in them ( i.e. three components of @xmath314 and one scalar function @xmath327 ) .",
    "therefore , one can utilize this one extra degree of freedom in choosing @xmath327 for a suitable gauge constraint without actually imposing any constraints on three components of @xmath314 .",
    "this will allow us to have freedom to choose the gauge and at the same time will not introduce the necessity of taking special measures in order to ensure that the gauge will be kept correctly throughout the computation .",
    "the magnetic field is than obtained by taking curl of @xmath314 .",
    "this way @xmath337 vanishes automatically within the discretization error associated with approximating the curl by finite differencing .    in the simulations presented in this work we used the following gauge @xmath338",
    "one can show that for this gauge the basic equation ( [ eqn13 ] ) reduces to @xmath339 we choose the gauge ( [ eqn20 ] ) because the resulting equation for @xmath314 has similarity with the equation for the advection of a vector quantity .",
    "it has the familiar advection term @xmath340 and diffusion term @xmath341 .",
    "the term @xmath342 corresponds to a stretching term @xmath343 in the equation for the advection of the magnetic field .",
    "finally , @xmath344 term is associated with the nonuniformity of electric conductivity . in this work",
    "we will consider the case of @xmath345 only and concentrate on the effects of the plasma flow producing the dynamo .",
    "thus this term drops out of the equations .",
    "note , that the equation  ( [ eqn21 ] ) is valid both for incompressible and compressible flows .",
    "finally , we present equations ( [ eqn21 ] ) written out in cylindrical coordinate system @xmath76 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 ( corresponding unit vectors are @xmath236 , @xmath246 , @xmath346 ) @xmath347 where @xmath348 . the gauge condition ( [ eqn20 ] ) takes the form @xmath349 also expressions for the magnetic field components in cylindrical coordinates are @xmath350      although the use of the vector potential eliminates the problem with the divergence cleaning , the boundary conditions in terms of the vector potential may be somewhat more complicated and not so obvious from intuitive physical standpoint than the boundary conditions for magnetic fields . in this work we used perfectly conducting boundary conditions at all boundaries of the cylinder .",
    "there is no general agreement on what boundary conditions are most physically appropriate for a thick accretion disk dynamo simulations .",
    "for example , @xcite used vacuum boundary conditions outside some given spherical domain for solving the mean field dynamo equations in axial symmetry .",
    "khanna  & camenzind ( 1996a , 1996b ) also considered an axisymmetric mean field dynamo in the disk and in the corona surrounding the disk on the kerr background gravitational field of a rotating black hole .",
    "they used an artificial boundary condition that the magnetic field is normal to the rectangular boundary of their computational domain and the poloidal component of the current density vanishes near the boundary .",
    "however , the main goal of these investigations was to demonstrate that certain types of helicity distributions inside the disk produce a dynamo .",
    "as soon as the boundary of the numerical domain is extended far enough from the region of large helicity and large differential rotation , the influence of the boundary conditions on the process of the generation of the magnetic fields far inside from the boundary should be small .",
    "since both the keplerian profile of the angular rotational velocity and the frequency of star - disk collisions have increasing values toward the central black hole , the approximation of a distant boundary can be applicable to the case of our simulations .",
    "therefore we have chosen a perfectly conducting rotating cylindrical boundary as a simple boundary condition prescription .",
    "we checked that the results of our simulations do not strongly depend on the position of the outer boundary .",
    "the magnetic field near the rotation axis is strongly influenced by the presence of the black hole as well as the general relativistic effects associated with the black hole .",
    "magnetic field lines in the region close to the rotation axis have their foot - points on the black hole horizon or in the region between the black hole and the inner edge of the accretion disk .",
    "therefore , one should expect that this region of the magnetosphere will be also strongly influenced by relativistic effects of the black hole .",
    "the subject of the influence of the central black hole on the magnetic fields produced by the dynamo is a part of the so - called `` black hole electrodynamics '' theory ( e.g. , see the chapter `` electrodynamics of black holes '' in @xcite ) . since the number density of stars should decrease near the black hole due to their capture by the black hole and due to tidal disruption",
    ", one should not expect the star - disk collision dynamo to operate effectively in this region , where strong relativistic effects are important . therefore ,",
    "for the purpose of this work we replace the region close to the axis of symmetry by imposing an inner cylindrical boundary ( also perfectly conducting )",
    ". this may be adequate to the real astrophysical situation in the coronae of the accretion disks , since there is highly conducting plasma there .",
    "we choose as an initial condition a purely poloidal magnetic field with even symmetry with respect to the plane of the disk ( see appendix  [ appendix_c ] for definitions and properties of odd and even magnetic fields ) .",
    "the field is contained within the computational boundaries such that the normal component of the magnetic field is zero on all boundaries .",
    "let us consider the perfectly conducting rotating boundaries .",
    "there is no magnetic flux penetrating the boundaries .",
    "this means that the normal component of the magnetic field must always remain zero on the boundary .",
    "if the velocity of the boundary is @xmath351 , then the tangential component of electric field in the rest frame of the moving boundary @xmath352 is also zero on the boundary .",
    "if @xmath351 and @xmath333 are both tangential at the boundary , then this implies that the tangential component of @xmath322 is also zero there .",
    "this then implies that we can chose the @xmath327 and the tangential components of @xmath314 to be zero on the boundary .",
    "then from expression  ( [ eqn20 ] ) and the vanishing of the normal component of @xmath315 on the boundary , we conclude that we must have @xmath353 there .",
    "specifically we have @xmath354 and @xmath355 this forms a complete set of three boundary conditions for three components of @xmath314 on each boundary , which are compatible both with the physical requirements for fields on a perfectly conducting boundary and the gauge condition ( [ eqn20 ] ) .",
    "one can also see that the equations ( [ eqn31][eqn32 ] ) are consistent in the corners of the computational domain , i.e. , at the intersections of the planes @xmath356 and cylinders @xmath357 .",
    "we use the finite differences predictor - corrector scheme to solve equations ( [ eqn22][eqn24 ] ) in cylindrical coordinates . for approximating advection and stretching terms",
    "we use central differencing , which gives second order accuracy in the coordinates .",
    "the diffusion term is approximated by the usual 7 point stencil .",
    "since the numerical method is explicit , it requires the stability condition to be satisfied .",
    "let us denote discretization intervals in coordinates and time as @xmath358 , @xmath359 , @xmath360 , and @xmath361 and define the quantities @xmath362 , @xmath363 , @xmath364 and @xmath365 , @xmath366 , @xmath367 .",
    "then , the stability conditions that we used in our simulations are @xmath368 one can show that these conditions follow from the local linear stability analysis of the dynamo equations  ( [ eqn22][eqn24 ] ) . before doing each new cycle of predictor - corrector calculations we set up the value of the time step @xmath361 .",
    "first , we choose some reasonable value of @xmath361 dictated by the accuracy requirements or how frequent we want to get an output measurements from our simulations .",
    "then , we decrease the value of @xmath361 until the first of the conditions in equation  ( [ eqn33 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "after that we check the second condition in ( [ eqn33 ] ) and see , if it is satisfied . if not , than we decrease @xmath361 further .",
    "one can see , that the second condition in equation ( [ eqn33 ] ) will be always satisfied at some value of @xmath361 since the right hand side depends on @xmath361 linearly while the left hand side depends on @xmath361 quadratically .",
    "the first stability criterion is the usual one for the diffusion equation and means that the diffusion per single time step propagates no further than through only a single grid cell .",
    "the second condition is specific for central differences in the advection term and means that the distance the magnetic field is advected during one time step @xmath361 is less than the distance through which the field diffuses per single time step @xmath361 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in practice , we ensure stability by using a safety coefficient of @xmath369 in the inequalities ( [ eqn33 ] ) .    when coding the boundary conditions ( [ eqn31][eqn32 ] ) we used a second order one sided difference scheme for approximating derivatives .",
    "the resulting expressions have been solved for the unknown value of the component of @xmath314 at the point on the boundary .",
    "boundary conditions have been updated after both predictor and corrector steps . in the @xmath234 direction seamless periodic boundary conditions",
    "have been used , i.e. we make the first and the last grid points in the @xmath234 direction identical and corresponding to @xmath370 and @xmath371 and use the same difference scheme as for other values of @xmath234 to update these points .",
    "also we used the same seamless treatment of lines @xmath370 and @xmath371 at the radial cylindrical boundaries and at the top and bottom boundaries .",
    "the code is able to treat both the domains with an inner radial boundary and the domains including the symmetry axis . in the latter case",
    ", there is a singularity of the grid at @xmath372 , namely , all grid points having @xmath372 and all values of @xmath234 from @xmath191 to @xmath373 coincide .",
    "one needs a special treatment of the grid points at @xmath372 ensuring the regularity of cartesian components @xmath374 , @xmath375 , @xmath376 of @xmath314 and the correct asymptotes for @xmath377 , @xmath378 and @xmath376 .",
    "if the values of the cartesian components at @xmath379 are @xmath380 , @xmath381 , @xmath382 , then the asymptotic behavior of the polar components is @xmath383 , @xmath384 , @xmath385 . to impose these asymptotic conditions",
    "we first interpolate @xmath380 , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 by calculating the average over @xmath234 of the cartesian components of the vector potential at grid points situated on a ring with radius @xmath358 .",
    "we take this average for @xmath380 , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 .",
    "then , we assign the values of the components of @xmath335 in the cylindrical coordinate system at @xmath372 according to @xmath386 , @xmath387 , @xmath388 .",
    "this finalizes the prescription for the boundary condition at @xmath372 . when the symmetry axis @xmath372 is included in the computational region , the code slows considerably because of the small ( @xmath389 ) distance between grid points in the @xmath234 direction and , therefore , more restrictive limitations on the time step imposed by the first of the conditions ( [ eqn33 ] ) .      in the process of writing the code we performed tests for separate parts of the code and , then , for the complete code itself .",
    "the diffusion part of the code has been tested by reproducing the analytic solution for eigenmodes of the diffusion equation @xmath390 with @xmath391 boundary conditions .",
    "a variety of different eigennumbers have been tested and decay rates are found to be in excellent agreement with analytic expressions .",
    "the code preserves the shape of eigenmodes with very high accuracy even for a very moderate number of nodes .",
    "coupling between equation ( [ eqn22 ] ) for @xmath377 and equation ( [ eqn23 ] ) for @xmath378 has been tested by evolving nonaxisymmetric eigenmodes .",
    "the advection part of the code has been tested by computing the advection by the uniform flow of the magnetic field of the type @xmath392 , where @xmath393 is a fixed vector of unit length ( we made a few runs with different directions of @xmath393 ) , and the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath394 has the constant gradient vector @xmath395 perpendicular to @xmath393 .",
    "the current density corresponding to such a magnetic field is uniform , and therefore , the magnetic field does not diffuse . the boundary condition for this test was set to time - dependent explicit values computed from the known purely advective behavior of the field .",
    "we observed good agreement with the picture of the pure advection of flow .",
    "we also compared the results for dynamo simulations with the two dimensional flow given by our code to the simulations produced by two other 2d kinematic dynamo codes , one evolving vector potential and another evolving magnetic field .",
    "the latter 2d code has a divergence cleaning procedure for @xmath396 .",
    "the flow was an axisymmetric beltrami flow with @xmath397 .",
    "for the interior of the domain @xmath398 and @xmath399 one can obtain the following analytic solution for the beltrami flow : @xmath400 where @xmath401 and @xmath402 are the bessel functions , @xmath403 is the first root of @xmath404 , @xmath405 .",
    "the solution can also be written in terms of the flux function @xmath406 : @xmath407 the 3d kinematic code picks up the fastest growing mode of the dynamo . in the case of axisymmetric",

    "the fastest growing mode in our simulations was with @xmath410 .",
    "the growth rate and the structure of the @xmath410 modes obtained with 3d and 2d codes agrees remarkably well .",

    "we now approximate the flow for our kinematic code from the analysis of the simplified model of plumes in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "when describing the results of our numerical simulations , we will use dimensionless units with the unit of length equal to the radius at which the star - disk collisions occur , and the unit of velocity equal to the keplerian velocity at that radius . then",
    ", one turn of the disk at unit radius takes @xmath373 dimensionless units of time .",
    "the disk is assumed to have constant thickness .",
    "its top boundary is at @xmath414 and bottom boundary is at @xmath415 .",
    "we usually put the disk at @xmath416 , in the middle of computational cylindrical domain , and then , @xmath417 .",
    "however , we will preserve separate notations for top and bottom boundaries .",
    "for simplicity we assume that all star - disk collisions happen at unit radius , but are randomly distributed in azimuthal angle along @xmath418 . also , a remarkable feature of star - disk collisions is that the numbers of stars crossing the disk in both directions are equal on average .",
    "we consider two models for the position of star - disk collisions addressing this property . in the first model",
    "we assume that collisions happen in pairs : at each time there are two collisions at @xmath418 , one with the star going up through the disk and the other at the opposite point on the circle @xmath418 with the star going down through the disk .",
    "thus , at any moment of time the flow is symmetric with respect to the inversion relative to the central point of the disk .",
    "the second model considers random directions of plumes as well as random distribution of plumes over the circle @xmath418 . in the next section",
    "we describe the results obtained with both models .",
    "the plume flow is superimposed onto a background of keplerian differential rotation occupying the whole computational domain @xmath419 .",
    "a star - disk collision is simulated by a vertically progressing cylinder of radius @xmath420 in the corotation frame .",
    "the cylinder starts at the bottom of the disk located at @xmath415 , penetrates the disk , and rises to a height of @xmath64 above the disk . at the same time the cylinder rotates about its axis opposite to the local keplerian frame",
    "such that the cylinder does not rotate about its axis if viewed in laboratory frame ( an inertial frame where the central black hole is at rest ) , but the axis corotates with the local keplerian frame .",
    "by the time the plume reaches its highest point , @xmath5 radians of keplerian rotation , the axis corotates with the keplerian flow also by @xmath5 radians on average . since the cylinder does not rotate about its axis , the relative rotation between the cylinder and keplerian flow corresponds to an untwisting of @xmath5 radians , when the local frame rotates @xmath5 radians as measured at the radius of the axis of the jet .",
    "the length of the cylinder is progressive with time and its velocity , @xmath421 .",
    "the vertical velocity of the gas inside the cylinder is constant and is equal to @xmath422 . after the time the plume rotates by @xmath5 it is stopped and the velocity field",

    "the dominance of the quadrupole magnetic field in the outer asymptotic region is obvious from fig .",
    "[ f_num_col ] . in the central region for @xmath481 , the field is strongly perturbed by individual plumes , and the nonaxisymmetric field caused by the action of each single plume is visible .",
    "toroidal magnetic field is also strongest in the central part of the computational domain .",
    "finally , let us compare the predictions of the flux rotation and the mean field theories with the results of our numerical simulation .",
    "all three predict that the growing magnetic field will be quadrupole .",
    "the simulation formally corresponds to @xmath544 , @xmath545 , @xmath546 in dimensionless units of simulation . using these parameters and @xmath547 in the expression for the growth rate in the flux rotation theory , equation  ( [ eqn3.43a ] ) , one obtains @xmath548 . for the mean field theory the expression  ( [ eqn3.53 ] ) gives @xmath549 , the dynamo number ( equation  ( [ eqn3.54 ] ) ) is @xmath550 , and both expressions  ( [ eqn3.55 ] ) and  ( [ eqn3.56 ] ) give @xmath551 .",
    "this is to be compared to numerical growth rate @xmath521 .",
    "both the flux rotation and especially the mean field theory growth rates are higher , but all three are within one order of magnitude from each other .",
    "such a result is satisfactory because of the far reaching extrapolations of the applicability of both flux rotation and mean field theories .",
    "we believe that by theory and calculation we have demonstrated that a robust @xmath273 dynamo is likely to occur in conducting accretion disks with a robust source of helicity .",
    "the growth rates as large as @xmath552 are expected . we have discussed in depth one such source of helicity in the accretion disk forming the central massive black holes of most galaxies .",
    "this is the almost inevitable star - disk collisions that should occur in the dense stellar populations at the center of the galaxy .",
    "we estimate that this source of helicity is far larger than necessary for the dynamo fields to reach saturation in less than the formation time of the black hole .",
    "star - disk collisions should also be the most robust source of helicity because the resulting plumes are driven several scale heights above the surface of the disk as compared to turbulence were the vertical motions are limited to a fraction of a scale height .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath553 dynamo is that because it produces a large scale coherent field outside the disk , the poloidal field , the differential winding of this poloidal field leads to a large scale force - free helix that transports the magnetic energy away from the disk and from the dynamo .",
    "the back reaction of this force - free field ( force - free except at the disk surface boundary ) only acts as a torque on the keplerian flow and thus the field energy of the force - free helix can grow at the expense of the free energy of formation of the black hole .",
    "the back reaction of this force - free field , being much smaller than the toroidal field , does not affect the plume formation by star - disk collisions .",
    "only the much larger toroidal field affects the plumes and this in turn must be less than the pressure inside the disk . thus the star disk collisions produce a robust dynamo where the back reaction does not quench the dynamo action at low values of field .",
    "the resulting exponential gain of this dynamo is an instability converting kinetic to magnetic energy .",
    "since the gain is large , the dynamo fields should rapidly grow to saturation or the back reaction limit .",
    "this limit we conjecture is the torque corresponding to the accretion flow of angular momentum away from the black hole .",
    "hence , the dynamo should convert a large fraction of the free energy of the black hole formation to magnetic energy .",

    "any arbitrary vector field @xmath554 can be decomposed into the sum of parts even and odd with respect to the reflection @xmath511 , @xmath555 .",
    "the following symmetry rules are valid for an even field : @xmath556 and for an odd field : @xmath557 often even fields are called quadrupole type fields and odd fields are called dipole type fields . the last terminology reflects on the largest scale modes possible within each symmetry class and allows one to visualize fields of each symmetry type easily .",
    "the even and odd decomposition of an arbitrary field @xmath558 can be performed as follows :    @xmath559    one can check that for any volume @xmath560 symmetric with respect to the plane @xmath416 @xmath561 this implies that if @xmath562 is a magnetic field , then the energy of the magnetic field is equal to the sum of the energies of its even and odd components .",
    "the even and odd components of solutions of equations  ( [ eqn3.50 ] ) and  ( [ eqn3.51 ] ) decouples if the mean velocity field is even , @xmath563 , @xmath564 , @xmath565 , the coefficient @xmath4 is antisymmetric with respect to reflection @xmath511 , and the coefficient @xmath38 is symmetric with respect to reflection @xmath511 .",
    "thus , even ( quadrupole ) and odd ( dipole ) modes will have different growth rates .",
    "the axisymmetric magnetic field is even if @xmath566 , @xmath567 and is odd if @xmath568 , @xmath569 .",
    "let us consider equation  ( [ asym_eqn1 ] ) written in spherical coordinates @xmath570 , @xmath571 , and @xmath234 such that @xmath572 and @xmath573 corresponds to the symmetry axis of the system",
    ". in the case of time - dependent flow described in section  [ subsec7.1 ] there are no eigenmodes with a fixed frequency . instead",
    ", the magnetic field can be represented as an integral over frequencies in the fourier transformation .",
    "however , in the case of a growing ( and possibly oscillating ) magnetic field , there is a characteristic growth rate @xmath195 of the dynamo averaged over plume pulses .",
    "in addition , the magnetic field will possess oscillating fourier components associated with the period of the emergence of plumes and , possibly , some intrinsic oscillatory behavior of the dynamo .",
    "we consider the behavior of one such fourier component assuming the dependence @xmath574 , where the complex @xmath575 is the sum of the real and imaginary parts as @xmath576 .",
    "the @xmath195 is the average growth rate of the dynamo , while @xmath577 can take on a whole range of values , including the frequency of plumes , the keplerian period , all its harmonics , etc .",
    "we impose the boundary condition for @xmath240 on some sphere of radius @xmath578 such that @xmath579 but still @xmath578 is of the order of @xmath427 .",
    "we assume that the value of @xmath240 at @xmath580 is dictated by the dynamo process inside @xmath578 .",
    "then , for one fourier component equation  ( [ asym_eqn1 ] ) becomes @xmath581 where @xmath582 is the angular operator acting on @xmath240 .",
    "in spherical geometry , equation  ( [ asym_eqn3 ] ) has separable variables @xmath570 and @xmath571 .",
    "thus , we look for solutions in the form @xmath583 .",
    "the operator @xmath584 commonly occurs in problems with axisymmetric flows , when solving the equation for the stream function . since the magnetic field should be finite on the axis @xmath572",
    ", the quantity @xmath585 must be finite at @xmath572 and at @xmath573 , because @xmath586 .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions @xmath587 satisfying these boundary conditions are @xmath588 where prime denotes the differentiation of the legendre polynomial @xmath589 with respect to @xmath590 and @xmath591 besides these eigenvalues , @xmath281 is also an eigenvalue with the eigenfunction @xmath592 .",
    "the first three eigenfunctions given by formula  ( [ asym_eqn4 ] ) are @xmath593 the angular dependence @xmath594 determines the symmetry of the solutions .",
    "the mode proportional to @xmath595 describes the radially directed magnetic field with nonzero total flux through the sphere from @xmath572 to @xmath573 .",
    "all terms with @xmath596 corresponds to the magnetic field with vanishing total flux through the sphere from @xmath572 to @xmath573 .",
    "the @xmath595 term can not be excited by the dynamo operating inside @xmath578 because of @xmath334 condition .",
    "this is also clear from the fact that @xmath597 when @xmath598 , which means that the vector potential can not be well defined for a magnetic field with @xmath599 .",
    "the terms with @xmath596 represent multipole expansion of the magnetic field in the far zone of the generation region .",
    "@xmath600 is a dipole term , @xmath601 is a quadrupole term , and so on .    for the radial part of the solution we obtain the equation @xmath602 we introduce a new variable @xmath603 where @xmath604 then , equation  ( [ asym_eqn6 ] ) reduces to the bessel equation of imaginary argument .",
    "solutions of this equation which vanishes at @xmath605 are given in terms of modified bessel function @xmath606 as @xmath607 the bessel functions of half - integer order can be expressed through elementary functions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we obtain for the dipole and quadrupole terms @xmath608 finally , collecting all the terms together and retaining only the leading dipole and quadrupole terms , we obtain the following solution for @xmath240 @xmath609 where the coefficients @xmath610 and @xmath611 should be determined by the condition of the continuity of harmonics of @xmath240 at the surface @xmath580 .",
    "the values of @xmath610 and @xmath611 are determined by the dynamo action inside the radius @xmath578 .",
    "we see that both dipole and quadrupole components ( and all higher multipole components ) decay as @xmath612 . using the expression  ( [ asym_eqn7 ] ) for @xmath332",
    "one obtains @xmath613 where we assumed @xmath614 and @xmath615 .",
    "the thickness of the skin layer is determined by the real part of the expression under the exponent in equation  ( [ asym_eqn9 ] ) .",
    "the larger the growth rate @xmath195 , the faster the magnetic field decays with the radius . also , oscillating modes with @xmath615 decay faster with the radius than the steady modes with @xmath616 .",
    "thus , far from the dynamo source one should expect the magnetic field to be growing in time , steadily , without oscillations .",
    "the characteristic length of the exponential decay of the field , @xmath530 , is found from equation  ( [ asym_eqn9 ] ) as @xmath617 for a steady magnetic field @xmath618 .",
    "when @xmath570 is approaching the radius of the outer boundary @xmath619 , the solution  ( [ asym_eqn8 ] ) starts to `` feel '' the boundary condition as an ideally conducting boundary and the numerical results at @xmath620 are not approximated by formula  ( [ asym_eqn8 ] ) .",
