    "a pseudoconvex @xmath0 manifold is called _ normal _ if it admits a _ reeb _ vector field whose flow preserves the @xmath0 structure ( in other words , it admits a symmetry transversal to the underlying contact structure ) .",
    "if the manifold has dimension 3 , this is equivalent to the fact that it admits a compatible riemannian _ sasakian _ structure , for which the above mentioned reeb vector field is a unitary killing vector field .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have classified the sasakian structures on compact 3-manifolds and shown that the underlying ( therefore normal ) @xmath0 structures essentially determine the sasakian structure ( in other words , the symmetry group of the @xmath0 structure is one - dimensional ) , in the case where the manifold is not a finite quotient of the 3-sphere .",
    "we obtained therefore the classification of the normal @xmath0 structures on these manifolds .",
    "on the other hand , finite quotients of @xmath1 admit normal @xmath0 structures with bigger automorphism groups ( for example the standard _ flat _ ( see next section )",
    "@xmath0 structure on @xmath1 admits @xmath2 as automorphism group ) , and in this case the problem of classifying these structures was still open .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to complete the classification of the normal @xmath0 structures on compact 3-manifolds by solving the remaining case of @xmath1 and its quotients . to do that",
    ", we study the automorphisms of the normal @xmath0 structures on @xmath1 and use the classification of the sasakian structures @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the only ( locally ) homogeneous normal @xmath0 structure is the standard one , and otherwise the ( connected component of the ) automorphism group is either a circle or a 2-torus ( section 3 , theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "there are other examples of homogeneous @xmath0 structures on compact 3-manifolds , but they are not normal : a left - invariant @xmath0 structure on @xmath1 admits no infinitesimal automorphism _ transversal _ to the contact distribution unless it is also right - invariant , i.e. flat .",
    "the classification of the normal @xmath0 structures on @xmath1 is then achieved in terms of the _ wrapping numbers _ of a certain uniquely defined @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath3 , whose orbits are all closed , and of the metric @xmath4 induced by projection on the orbit space of @xmath3 ( this space is topologically @xmath5 , possibly with 1 or 2 conical points )  see section 3 and theorem [ clas ] .",
    "note that , _ a priori _ , the invariant tensor of a @xmath0 structure in dimension 3 is the _",
    "tanaka curvature tensor _",
    "( an analogue of the cotton - york tensor from conformal geometry ) , which , even in the simple case of a normal @xmath0 structure , depends on a second order derivative of the curvature of @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we consider the following question : which contact structures admit compatible normal @xmath0 structures ? in dimension 3 , any contact manifold @xmath7 admits an infinity of compatible @xmath0 structures on it  : to pick such a complex structure @xmath8 on @xmath9 , all we need is to choose a positive definite metric on @xmath9 , as there is no integrability condition for @xmath8 required .",
    "so , the existence of a @xmath0 structure in dimension 3 implies no topological condition at all ( except orientability ) , because every 3-manifold admits a contact structure @xcite .",
    "but if we want to find compatible _ normal _ @xmath0 structures on @xmath7 , then we already know that @xmath10 has to be a finite quotient of a principal circle bundle over a riemann surface , of non - zero chern class @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , we want to know what contact structures , up to diffeomorphism , on such a manifold admit compatible normal @xmath0 structures .",
    "it turns out that there exists at most one , which turns out to be _ tight _ ( proposition [ cont ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we recall the classification of sasakian structures on @xmath1 and we study in detail the orbits of the occurring @xmath0 reeb vector fields ; in section 3 we consider , in general , the differential equation related to the existence of multiple @xmath0 reeb vector fields and describe the structure of the lie algebra of the @xmath0 automorphism group .",
    "the proof of the main result ( theorem [ main ] , stated at the beginning of section 3 ) is contained in section 4 and 5 .",
    "the classification result ( theorem [ clas ] ) follows in section 6 from the previous sections and the investigation of the flat structures on @xmath1 . in section 7",
    "we describe the contact structures underlying a normal @xmath0 structure in dimension 3 .",

    "in this paper , we call a @xmath0 structure @xmath11 on an odd - dimensional oriented manifold @xmath12 with a _ contact _ distribution of hyperplanes @xmath13 ( such that , if @xmath14 is a non - vanishing _ ( contact ) _ 1-form for which @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is a non - vanishing volume form on @xmath10 ) , endowed with a _ compatible _ complex structure @xmath8 , i.e. , for @xmath14 as above , @xmath17 .    in this case , @xmath18 is a bilinear symmetric non - degenerate form on @xmath9 . if @xmath19 , we will always consider _ positive _ contact forms @xmath14 , i.e. such that @xmath20 is a positive definite hermitian metric on @xmath9 ( the renormalization factor is useful when considering sasakian structures  to be defined below ) .",
    "the canonical orientation of the manifold is then , by definition , given by the volume form @xmath21 .    with this convention ,",
    "the canonical orientation of @xmath1 with its standard @xmath0 structure induced from its embedding in @xmath22 is reverse to the usual one .    in general , in contact geometry one can associate to each contact form",
    "@xmath14 a canonical vector field @xmath23 , called a _ reeb _ vector field , such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 stands for the lie derivative .",
    "@xmath23 is called a @xmath0 reeb vector field if , in addition , @xmath27 . here",
    "we follow the convention from @xcite and consider as a _",
    "tensor _ on a contact manifold any tensorial combination of elements in the tensorial algebras of @xmath28 , @xmath9 , @xmath29 and their duals ; with respect to that , @xmath30 is a tensor and the lie derivative @xmath31 can be restricted to @xmath32 because @xmath9 is @xmath23-invariant , so the equation @xmath27 makes sense .",
    "if @xmath23 satisfies this equation , it is an infinitesimal automorphism of the @xmath0 structure of @xmath10 , transverse to @xmath9 ; conversely , any such vector field is a @xmath0 reeb vector field for an appropriate contact form .",
    "a reeb vector field is _ positive _ if associated to a positive contact form , _ negative _ otherwise .",
    "a _ cr _ structure is called _ normal _ if it admits a @xmath0 reeb vector field .",
    "a _ sasakian _ structure @xmath33 on a 3-dimensional manifold @xmath10 is a riemannian metric @xmath34 admitting a unitary killing vector field @xmath35 such that @xmath36 is a complex structure @xmath8 on @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath35 is unitary killing , then @xmath36 is antisymmetric and vanishes on @xmath35 ; the above condition ensures , in addition , that its square is minus the identity on @xmath9 . in higher odd dimensions",
    "@xmath8 has to satisfy some integrability conditions , which are vacuous in dimension 3 .",
    "it is easy to see that , if @xmath38 is sasakian , then @xmath39 , with the notations above , is a normal @xmath0 structure , because @xmath35 is a @xmath0 reeb vector field .",
    "conversely , it turns out that for any positive @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath23 , the riemannian metric defined to be equal to @xmath40 on @xmath9 , for @xmath24 , @xmath15 , and such that @xmath23 is unitary and orthogonal to @xmath9 , is sasakian @xcite , @xcite",
    ".    the sasakian structures on a compact 3-manifold have been completely classified @xcite using the theory of _ locally conformally khler metrics _ with parallel lee form on compact complex surfaces @xcite , and , if we could tell which sasakian metrics on @xmath10 have the same underlying @xmath0 structure , we could reduce the problem of classification of the normal @xmath0 structures on @xmath10 to the previous one , which is solved .",
    "it turns out @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that @xmath10 is then always a finite quotient of a non - flat ( i.e. with non - zero chern class ) circle bundle over a riemann surface ( and endowed with the appropriate orientation ) , and if this surface has positive genus , the orbits of a reeb vector field are always the fibers of such a fibration ( the corresponding sasakian metrics are called then _ regular _ ) . in this case",
    ", it follows @xcite that each normal @xmath0 structure on @xmath10 admits , up to multiplication by a constant , exactly one @xmath0 reeb vector field , and , if we fix the length of its orbits to be equal to @xmath41 , the @xmath0 structures on @xmath10 are in 11 correspondence to the sasakian structures satisfying the above normalization condition . that closes the classification of normal cr structures on 3-manifolds which are not covered by @xmath1 .",
    "locally , every sasakian structure can be realized as a fibration over a surface , with a suitable connection on it , and we are frequently going to use the terminology from fiber bundles : we will often refer to the vectors in @xmath9 as _ horizontal _ , and to @xmath35 as _",
    "vertical_.    from the classification @xcite",
    "we retain the following facts concerning sasakian structures on @xmath1 ( and its quotients )  : on @xmath1 there are regular sasakian structures ( with respect to the hopf fibration of @xmath1 over @xmath42 ) , but also _ quasi - regular _",
    "( i.e. all the orbits of the reeb vector field are closed , but of different lengths ) or _ irregular _ ( some orbits of the reeb vector field are not closed ) .",
    "the structure of the orbits will be discussed below in detail .",
    "the orbits of a quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector field are the fibers of a seifert fibration of @xmath1 over a simply - connected _ orbifold _ with 1 conical point , or with 2 conical points with different angles . in general , an _",
    "orbifold _ is a topological space endowed with a differential structure with singularities , and it is given by an atlas of charts pointing to open sets in @xmath43 or in quotients of @xmath43 by finite linear groups . in dimension 2 ,",
    "conical _ point of _ angle _ @xmath44 has a neighborhood diffeomorphic to the quotient of the unit disc in @xmath45 by the cyclic group generated by multiplication by a @xmath46-th root of unity .",
    "it is well - known that the orbifolds that occur above are not finite quotients of any smooth surface .",
    "* convention . * from now on , the manifold denoted by @xmath10 will be implicitly considered to be diffeomorphic to @xmath1 and endowed with a normal @xmath0 structure . except",
    "otherwise stated , the symbol @xmath1 , when used to denote a @xmath0 manifold , will be reserved to the standard ( flat ) @xmath0 structure on the three - sphere .",
    "as already mentioned , the sasakian structures on @xmath47 have been investigated by considering the riemannian product @xmath48 , endowed naturally with a complex structure ( we extend @xmath8 such that it sends @xmath35 into a unitary vector field on the @xmath49 factor ) ; this complex surface is a _ primary hopf _ surface _ without resonance ( or of class 1 ) _",
    "@xcite , i.e. it is the quotient of @xmath50 by an infinite cyclic group generated by a contraction @xmath51 and with parallel _ lee form _",
    "@xmath52 ( defined by the equation @xmath53 ) equal to ( a constant times ) @xmath54 , the length form on the factor @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "the key information that we will use here is that the _ lee vector field _ , which is the dual of the lee form , and equal to ( a constant times ) @xmath55 ( where @xmath35 is the reeb vector field on the sasakian manifold @xmath38 ) , turns out ( @xcite , proposition 8) to be , up to a constant , identified on @xmath22 with @xmath56 and to get the expression that corresponds to @xmath35 we have to multiply this with @xmath57 and , possibly , a real constant .",
    "the condition to get the above product structure on @xmath50 ( for example , it is necessary , but not sufficient , the orbits of @xmath58 to be closed ) is that @xmath59 and @xmath60 , so both are real positive numbers @xcite .",
    "the regularity of the sasakian structure @xmath61 is then decided by the ratio @xmath62 :    [ reg ] @xmath35 is regular , quasi - regular , resp .",
    "irregular if and only if @xmath62 is equal to 1 , rational or irrational .",
    "this ratio is exactly the ratio of the lengths of the _ exceptional _ orbits of @xmath35 contained in the complex lines @xmath63 , resp .",

    "generic ( i.e. , different from the 2 exceptional ones ) orbit are @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a positive constant .",
    "if @xmath62 is irrational , then a generic orbit of @xmath35 is dense in a 2-dimensional torus ; outside the exceptional orbits , the rest of @xmath1 is foliated by these tori , to which are tangent all @xmath0 reeb vector fields ( which commute with @xmath35 ) and are represented in @xmath22 by @xmath70 , for @xmath71 ( in particular , this set contains the regular @xmath0 reeb vector field represented by @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is enough to note that the orbits of @xmath35 in @xmath10 can be identified to the orbits of @xmath73 on @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a sasakian structure such that its product with @xmath49 leads to the hopf surface @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , for @xmath76 mutually prime and @xmath77 is a constant .",
    "then @xmath78 is quasi - regular , and the space @xmath79 of its orbits in @xmath47 ( seen as a factor in the riemannian product @xmath48 , and not as the standard 3-sphere in @xmath22 ) is the space of the complex orbits of @xmath35  seen as a holomorphic vector field  in @xmath80 .",
    "it is topologically @xmath42 , and the projection from @xmath80 is the holomorphic map @xmath81 $ ] , but this fails to be a submersion at the _ poles _ @xmath82 $ ] and @xmath83 $ ] .    to recover the orbifold structure of the basis @xmath79 we proceed as follows : around the exceptional orbit contained in @xmath84 we consider a covering @xmath85 defined by @xmath86 .",

    "the map from @xmath88 to @xmath79 , which assigns to each orbit of @xmath92 the corresponding orbit of @xmath35 , is then the ramified covering @xmath93\\mapsto[x^q : y^q]$ ] , which gives the orbifold structure around the pole @xmath82 $ ]  this is thus a conical point of angle @xmath94 ( a smooth point has angle @xmath41 ) .",
    "note that the orbits of @xmath92 have the same length as the generic orbits of @xmath35 , over each of which project @xmath95 different orbits of @xmath92 . over the exceptional orbit contained in @xmath96",
    "is `` wrapped '' one orbit of @xmath92 @xmath95 times .",
    "an analogue statement holds for the other pole : @xmath83 $ ] is then a conical point of angle @xmath97 , there is a ramified covering with @xmath98 leaves over it , the source smooth manifold being the orbit space of @xmath92 , the lift of @xmath35 on some @xmath98-fold smooth covering of @xmath99 , these orbits generating a fibration , and the generic orbits of @xmath35 are covered by @xmath98 different @xmath92 orbits , the exceptional one by only one , `` wrapped '' @xmath98 times .    the situation where one of @xmath98 or @xmath95 is equal to 1 corresponds to the _ teardrop _ orbifold ( a sphere with one conical point ) , if both are superior to one we get two conical points .    the ratios between the lengths of a generic orbit and an exceptional one , in case of a quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath35 , are called the _ wrapping numbers _ of @xmath35 .    of course",
    ", the wrapping numbers coincide with the multiplicity , at the conical points , of the ramified coverings defined above .",
    "an important fact , that does not directly follow from the section above , but from @xcite , @xcite , is the following :    [ rapel ] the @xmath0 structure of an irregular sasakian metric @xmath38 always admits a regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath3 which commutes with @xmath35 ; on the other hand , if @xmath100 is a regular sasakian metric on @xmath1 , it admits a @xmath0 reeb vector field commuting with @xmath3 if and only if the metric induced by @xmath101 on the basis @xmath42 ( recall that the orbits of @xmath3 are the fibers of a @xmath49 fibration on @xmath42 ) admits a killing vector field .    to summarize , there are three types of normal @xmath0 structures on @xmath1 : with a regular @xmath0 reeb vector field ; with a regular and an irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field , commuting ; with a quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector field .",
    "the last situation can be described , locally around each reeb orbit , as ( a finite quotient of ) a regular sasakian structure ( see the construction in the remark above ; the lifted vector @xmath92 is regular ) .",
    "note that we do not know yet whether these types overlap or not . in the next sections",
    ", we are going to prove :    [ main ] if a normal @xmath0 structure admits no irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field , then it admits a unique ( up to a constant ) regular or quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector field ; the connected component of its @xmath0 automorphism group is then @xmath49 .",
    "if a normal @xmath0 structure admits an irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field , then it is either the standard flat one ( in which case the automorphism group is @xmath2 ) or it admits an unique regular @xmath0 reeb vector field ; in this latter case , the 2 @xmath0 reeb fields span the ( abelian ) lie algebra of the @xmath0 automorphism group , whose connected component is a 2-dimensional torus .    to prove this theorem we will investigate the existence , on a sasakian manifold @xmath61 , of other @xmath0 reeb vector fields @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the component in @xmath104 of @xmath105 , and @xmath106 , a positive function .",
    "it turns out @xcite that @xmath105 is a reeb vector field if and only if @xmath107 and that it is a @xmath0 reeb vector field if and only if @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the _ tanaka - webster _ connection on @xmath110 , defined as follows : @xmath111 and the following conditions on its torsion @xmath112 : @xmath113 where the norm is relative to the sasakian metric .",
    "the tanaka - webster connection can easily be related to the levi - civita connection of the above sasakian metric @xcite , but it is more suitable than this one in the case of a regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath35 , because it is easily constructed from the fibration ( following the orbits of @xmath35 ) data @xcite ; in particular , the operator @xmath114 , if @xmath106 is a function constant along @xmath35 , can be computed using formally the same expression above , but replacing @xmath109 with @xmath115 , the levi - civita connection on the basis @xmath79 ( the space of the orbits of @xmath35 ) .",
    "such functions appear when we look for @xmath0 reeb vector fields @xmath116 commuting with @xmath35 , when @xmath117 and @xmath103 is the horizontal lift of the vector field @xmath118 on @xmath79 ; the following lemma holds :    [ l1 ] the horizontal part @xmath103 of a @xmath0 reeb vector field commuting with the ( quasi)-regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath35 on @xmath1 projects on the basis @xmath79 as a killing vector field , whose orbits , with the exception of two , which are points ( among which the one or two possible conic points of the orbifold @xmath79 ) , are all circles .",
    "the regular case has been treated in @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath103 projects on a killing vector field follows from a local computation , so it holds also in the quasi - regular case .",
    "as any isometry of an orbifold has to fix ( or interchange ) the conical points , it follows that @xmath103 vanishes at the conical points .",
    "now , if a killing vector field on a ( even open ) surface has a zero , then it is isolated and has index 1 ; we can smoothen the conical points and deform a little @xmath103 such as the resulting vector field on @xmath5 has the same number of zeros , each with the same index as before",
    ". they must be thus exactly 2 , as the euler characteristic of @xmath5 ; we will call these degenerate orbits of @xmath103 _ poles_. the other orbits of @xmath103 are smooth submanifolds , because they coincide with the level sets of @xmath106 ( recall that @xmath119 ) , and that @xmath120 is non - degenerate away from the 2 poles ) .    [ irr ] let @xmath35 be an irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field on @xmath1 .",
    "then there is a unique regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath3 which commutes with @xmath35 .",
    "we know that there exists such a @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "consider the closure of an orbit of @xmath35 : this is a torus @xmath123 .",
    "from the standpoint of @xmath121 , @xmath35 is a commuting @xmath0 reeb vector field : as such , @xmath124 , @xmath125 is a killing vector field on @xmath126 , the space of the orbits of @xmath121 , and we know from lemma [ reg ] that the orbits of @xmath35  as an irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field commuting with @xmath121  are dense in tori to which @xmath121 is tangent .",

    ", @xmath121 is determined by its value at a point @xmath127 ( as @xmath121 commutes with @xmath35 , we transport , through the flow of @xmath35 , this vector to all the points situated on the orbit of @xmath35 passing through @xmath127 , and this set is dense ) . the same holds for @xmath3 , so if @xmath121 coincides with @xmath3 at a point of @xmath123 , it coincides everywhere . in any case",
    "we get that @xmath128=0 $ ] on @xmath123 , and , as @xmath123 was arbitrarily chosen , @xmath3 and @xmath121 commute on @xmath1 . as they are both regular , they coincide ( lemma [ reg ] , see also the remark below ) .",
    "any @xmath0 reeb vector field has at least 2 closed orbits ; for example , if we consider a @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath105 commuting with a regular one , @xmath35 , the orbits of @xmath35 and @xmath105 over the two poles @xmath129 and @xmath130 coincide , but they have different lengths ; if they both have length 1 for @xmath35 ( measured using the dual contact form @xmath14 ) , their lengths for @xmath105 ( measured using the contact 1-form @xmath131 dual to @xmath105 ) are @xmath132 , resp .",
    "@xmath133 . unless @xmath106 is everywhere constant , these are then different , because the values of @xmath106 at the poles are the only critical points of @xmath106 , thus its 2 extrema .",
    "so there is no other regular @xmath0 reeb vector field commuting with @xmath35 , and if @xmath35 admits other commuting @xmath0 reeb fields , one can always find irregular ones among them ( we can modify the ratio of the maximum and minimum of @xmath106 , if @xmath106 is not constant , by adding to @xmath106 some positive constant ) .",
    "the last statement also holds if @xmath35 is a quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector field : any solution @xmath106 of the equation @xmath134 still has only 2 critical points ( see above ) , hence they coincide with its extrema .    of course , the equation @xmath135 being linear , the space of its solutions is a vector space , containing the constants ; this space can be identified with the lie algebra of the @xmath0 automorphisms group , the solution corresponding to @xmath35 is the constant @xmath136 , and the solutions corresponding to @xmath0 reeb vector fields form the cone of everywhere - positive solutions . if @xmath35 is regular , then we can integrate @xmath106 on the fibers ( the orbits of @xmath35 ) using the contact 1-form @xmath14 dual to @xmath35 , and get the function @xmath137 , which is constant on the orbits of @xmath35 , and still verifies the equation @xmath138 ; it thus corresponds to a @xmath0 reeb vector field ( more generally , if @xmath106 is not everywhere positive , a @xmath0 infinitesimal automorphism ) which commutes with @xmath35 .",
    "we can consider then @xmath139 as a linear projection on the commutator of @xmath35 ( it is even a projector if we fix , by no loss of generality , the length of the orbits of @xmath35 to be equal to 1 ) .",
    "this commutator is 1-dimensional if @xmath79 admits no killing vector fields , 2-dimensional if it admits one , and 4-dimensional if @xmath140 has a round metric .    if @xmath35 is a quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector field , whose generic orbits have length @xmath141 , and its exceptional orbits @xmath142 and @xmath143 have lengths @xmath144 , resp . @xmath145 ( for @xmath146 mutually prime , and @xmath147 ) , and if @xmath106 is a solution to the equation @xmath134 , we define @xmath137 on a generic orbit as the integral of @xmath106 on it , and on an exceptional orbit , say , @xmath142 , as @xmath95 times the integral of @xmath106 on it .",
    "the resulting function @xmath137 on @xmath79 , the space of the @xmath35 orbits , is smooth in all the smooth points of @xmath79 , and continuous at the conical points .",
    "moreover , if we lift it to one of the local ramified coverings of one of the poles , say , @xmath148 ( see above ) , @xmath149 , we get a smooth function , which is actually obtained by integration along the orbits of the regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath92 on some smooth covering of a neighborhood of @xmath142 ( see above ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath137 satisfies the equation for @xmath0 infinitesimal automorphisms commuting with @xmath35 , and @xmath139 is , also in this case , a linear projection ( a projector if @xmath150 ) on the commutator of @xmath35 , which can be 1-dimensional ( no killing vector field on @xmath79 ) , or 2-dimensional . as a non - smooth orbifold can not admit more than 1 linear independent killing fields , these are the only cases .    if a quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb field @xmath35 admits no linearly independent commuting @xmath0 reeb field , and if @xmath134 , then @xmath137 is constant everywhere .",

    "@xmath46 can be retrieved , by computation , from @xmath338 : we use that @xmath350 , as @xmath351 is unitary and is tangent to the meridians , which are geodesics , and @xmath352=[jx , rx]=0 $ ] , as @xmath334 is killing and thus preserves the meridians , and get : @xmath353=\\frac{r'}{r}x\\ ] ] everywhere except in the poles , thus @xmath354 on the above dense open set in @xmath5 . the derivatives are taken with respect to the arc length parameterization , hence correspond to derivations along the vector field @xmath351 .",
    "we get thus the following equation : @xmath355 which , together with ( [ eq : dk ] ) , yields a second order non - linear differential equation on @xmath340 , for which we seek periodic solutions : @xmath356 this equation can not be integrated , in general ( using elementary functions ) , but it is equivalent to a first order system of ordinary differential equations , given by the following vector field on @xmath210 ( in coordinates @xmath357 ) : @xmath358 ( for any solution @xmath46 of ( [ eqq ] ) , the curve @xmath359 is an integral curve of @xmath360 , and conversely , the first component of any integral curve of @xmath360 is a solution of ( [ eqq ] ) . )",
    "any solution to the equation ( [ eqq ] ) is a solution of an equation of the type @xmath361 which comes from the fact that , if @xmath362 solves ( [ eqq ] ) , then @xmath363 satisfy an order 3 algebraic equation ( see below ) that leads to ( [ weier ] ) .",
    "the general solution to this equation is an elliptic function and can not be expressed , in general , in terms of elementary functions .",
    "a simple way to find a solution of ( [ eqq ] ) could be , _ a priori _ , the following : a regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath35 on @xmath1 equipped with the standard @xmath0 structure is still a killing vector field for the sasakian structure given by another @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath92 , provided that @xmath201=0 $ ] ; the metrics induced , by projection , on the space @xmath79 of orbits of @xmath35 , from the sasakian metric on @xmath1 determined by @xmath35 or by @xmath92 are different , and their curvatures @xmath364 both satisfy the equation @xmath365 ; it is , however , easy to check that @xmath366 is , as well as @xmath46 , constant ; not only they are conformally equivalent ( through the identity of @xmath79 ) , but also isometric up to a global homothety .",
    "so we do nt get this way any non - trivial solution to ( [ eqq ] ) .",
    "we seek for periodic solutions of ( [ eqq ] ) , hence for closed integral curves of @xmath360 ( [ z ] ) .",
    "first we note that , for negative @xmath69 , the component along @xmath367 of @xmath360 is always negative , fact which excludes any periodic orbit .",
    "for @xmath368 the only periodic orbit is the fixed point @xmath369 . in general",
    ", the orbits of @xmath360 are contained in the level sets of the function @xmath370 , @xmath371 which are cubics in @xmath210 :    for values of @xmath372 contained between @xmath373 and @xmath374 , where @xmath375 , its level sets are cubics with 2 connected components in @xmath210 , one of which is an embedded line , and the other an embedded circle  each of which is an orbit of @xmath360 , because @xmath360 does not vanish on these curves  ; the level set @xmath376 has 2 components , one of which is the fixed point @xmath377 and the other an embedded line  which is an orbit of @xmath360  ; the level set @xmath378 has only 1 connected component  a cubic with a simple double point in @xmath379  , and contains one stationary orbit @xmath380 and 3 different , non - periodic orbits of @xmath360 , which are exactly the connected components of the above cubic after removal of the fixed point @xmath379 of @xmath360 . for other values of @xmath372",
    "its level sets consist , each of them , of one connected cubic in @xmath210 , diffeomorphic to @xmath340 , and containing one ( non - periodic ) orbit of @xmath360 .",
    "( see figure above )    the only case which is interesting for the equation ( [ eqq ] ) , for which we seek periodic solutions , is @xmath381 ( thus @xmath382 ) , and the solutions whose orbits coincide with the embedded circles contained in the level sets of @xmath372 , for values of @xmath372 between @xmath383 and @xmath374 .",
    "actually all the solutions obtained this way satisfy the equation ( [ eqq ] ) , and yield metrics on @xmath337 with the desired property ( @xmath8 times the differential of the curvature is dual to a killing vector field ) ; it remains to check the smoothness at the poles : the only condition is that the constructed metric gives an angle of @xmath41 around each pole .",
    "this angle can be measured by integration around a pole ( that is , multiplication by @xmath41  the period of the killing vector field @xmath339 ) of the differential of the length of @xmath334 .",
    "we need thus @xmath384 where @xmath385 are the solutions , between @xmath386 and @xmath387 , of the equation @xmath388 , or equivalently , @xmath389 are the points where the considered orbit of @xmath360 crosses the @xmath390 axis  these points correspond to @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which are the extrema of @xmath46 , thus where @xmath391 vanishes . because @xmath392 and @xmath393 ( the orbit `` turns around '' the fixed point @xmath377 ) , the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is equivalent to : @xmath394 on the other hand , the fact that @xmath395 ( and @xmath396 ) is equivalent to @xmath397 it follows then that @xmath398 , which leads to @xmath399 , contradiction .",
    "so there is no metric on @xmath5 such that @xmath8 times the curvature is dual to a killing vector field , except the constant curvature metric ( in which case the corresponding killing vector field is trivial ) .",
    "if we are looking for a metric with conical points at the poles @xmath400 , with wrapping ( natural ) numbers @xmath401 , resp .",
    "@xmath402 , the reasoning above remains unchanged , except for the part referring to the angles given by the metric at the poles ; we need to replace equation ( [ eq1 ] ) by the following system : @xmath403 which is equivalent to @xmath404 from here , we get the expressions of @xmath405 , then replace them in ( [ s12 ] ) and finally get : @xmath406 which implies @xmath407 thus , for any pair of mutually prime numbers @xmath408 ( the last one may be equal to 1 , in which case we get a teardrop orbifold metric on @xmath5 ) , and for each fixed @xmath147 , there is exactly one value of the parameter @xmath387 , and exactly one orbit of @xmath360 , thus exactly one solution of ( [ eqq ] ) , which is equivalent to @xmath409 from the point of view of the metric that we obtain on @xmath140 , the change in the parameter @xmath348 means a homothety ( i.e. , if we fix the total volume of @xmath79 , then @xmath348 is unique ) .",
    "we have proven :    [ plat ] for any regular @xmath0 reeb vector field on a flat @xmath0 structure on @xmath1 , the orbit space has constant curvature .",
    "the metric on the orbit space of a quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector field @xmath35 is , up to homothety , determined by the wrapping numbers of @xmath35 .",
    "we obtain , in particular , another proof of the unicity of the @xmath0 flat structure on @xmath1 , under the additional supposition that it admits global @xmath0 reeb vector fields .",
    "of course , this fact holds in general , as a consequence of the theory of cartan connections @xcite .    as mentioned before ,",
    "the orbifold metrics on @xmath5 for which the curvature function @xmath46 satisfies @xmath410 can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions _ in the arc length parameterization of the meridians_. in fact , these metrics , an their curvatures , are easy to compute , as the corresponding sasakian metrics on @xmath1 , because they are determined by quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector fields on @xmath1 , all of which can be explicitely computed .",
    "the metrics on their orbit spaces can be explicitly given in terms of elementary functions .",
    "but this does not lead to any contradiction , because it is the _ arc length parameterization of the meridians _  as a solution to a second degree differential equation  which can not be expressed in terms of elementary functions .",
    "theorem [ plat ] has interesting geometric implications on the automorphism group of the standard @xmath0 structure on @xmath1 , namely @xmath2 :    the commutator of any regular @xmath0 reeb vector field in@xmath411 is 4-dimensional .",
    "for any 2 quasi - regular @xmath0 reeb vector fields @xmath412 ,",
    "@xmath413 with the same wrapping numbers there is an element in @xmath2 mapping @xmath412 on a constant multiple of @xmath413 .",
    "another consequence of this is that we can check if two @xmath0 structures are isomorphic , just looking at the @xmath0 reeb vector field and at the metric induced on the orbit space ( recall that any irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field admits exactly one commuting regular one  it is easy to find it just by looking at the lengths of the exceptional orbits of the irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field  see section 3 ) , thus reducing the problem of comparing 2 @xmath0 structures to the elementary problem of comparing 2 metrics on a riemann surface  more generally , an orbifold :    [ clas ] if 2 sasakian metrics on a compact 3-manifold @xmath10 admit the same underlying @xmath0 structure , then :    1 .",
    "they are both regular and are _ 0-type deformation _ of each other , if @xmath10 is not a quotient of @xmath1 ; 2 .   if @xmath414 or a finite quotient , first we replace ( if necessary ) the irregular sasakian metrics with the ( uniquely defined ) regular sasakian metrics by _",
    "basic first type deformations _ , so we only need to compare ( quasi- ) regular sasakian structures . if the sasakian structures are both quasi - regular with the same wrapping numbers they are 0-type deformations of each other ; if they have different wrapping numbers the underlying @xmath0 structure is flat , and the metric induced on each one s orbit space is determined , following the procedure described in the proof of theorem [ plat ] , by the wrapping numbers .    by definition @xcite ,",
    "a _ 0-type deformation _ of a sasakian metric is a rescaling of the reeb vector field ( multiplication by a constant ) , and a _ first type deformation _ is given by a change in the @xmath0 reeb vector field ( [ t ] ) ; it is called _ basic _ if we use in ( [ t ] ) a function constant along the orbits of the reeb vector field .",
    "a 0-type deformation is , thus , a particular basic first type deformation , given by an everywhere constant function . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "second type deformation _ is defined by keeping the same @xmath0 reeb vector field , the same operator @xmath8  previously extended to @xmath28 by acting trivially on the reeb vector field  , and by changing the metric on the orbit space  as a consequence , the contact structure will be modified .",
    "a non - trivial second type deformation of a sasakian structure always changes the underlying @xmath0 structure .",
    "if the @xmath0 reeb vector field is quasi - regular , this follows from the theorems above ; if it is irregular , then any second type deformation of it necessarily commutes with the first type deformation that replaces the irregular @xmath0 reeb vector field with the unique ( commuting ) regular one , and we can apply the conclusion above .",
    "[ cont ] let @xmath10 be a compact 3-manifold .",
    "then , up to isomorphism , there exists at most one contact structure on @xmath10 underlying a normal @xmath0 structure .",

    "tight_.    by definition , an _ over twisted _",
    "contact structure is one such that it exists an embedded disc @xmath415 , transverse to @xmath9 everywhere except in a point @xmath416 in the interior of @xmath417 , and such that the border of @xmath417 is tangent to @xmath9 .",
    "a @xmath0 structure is called _ tight _ if it is not overtwisted .",
    "overtwisted contact structures exist on any orientable 3-manifold @xcite , and the isotopy classes of overtwisted contact structures on @xmath10 coincide with their homotopy classes in the category of 2-plane fields in @xmath10 @xcite . on the other hand , tight structures are more rigid :",
    "there is only one isotopy class of tight contact structures on @xmath1 @xcite ; recently , there have been found examples of 3-manifolds not admitting tight contact structures @xcite .    we know , from @xcite , that , if @xmath10 admits a normal @xmath0 structure , then it is a finite quotient of a circle bundle @xmath418 over a riemann surface @xmath79 with non - zero chern class , and , in most of the cases ( see the exceptions below ) , this @xmath0 structure is @xmath49-invariant , where the @xmath49-action is free and transverse to the underlying contact structure .",
    "the latter is thus given by a connection on the @xmath49-bundle @xmath419 ( where @xmath79 is the orbit space of @xmath49 ) , such that its curvature is a given volume form on @xmath79 ( from here follows that the chern class should be non - zero ) . on @xmath418 , we have thus a @xmath266-invariant sasakian structure , where @xmath266 is the covering group of the finite covering @xmath420 . on @xmath418 , all ( @xmath266-invariant ) contact structures which are invariant and transverse to the free action of @xmath49 are homotopic within ( @xmath266-invariant ) contact structures @xcite , and this ( @xmath266-equivariant ) homotopy is followed by a ( @xmath266-equivariant ) isotopy @xcite , @xcite .    on the other hand , all free @xmath49 actions on @xmath10 ( and , implicitly , the diffeomorphism type of the quotient space @xmath79 )",

    "we can , nevertheless , deform the metric on the orbifold @xmath79 such that it admits a killing vector field ; the corresponding ( second type ) deformation of the @xmath0 structures is such that the underlying contact structures are all isotopic @xcite ; but the new @xmath0 structure admits at least 2 linearly independent @xmath0 reeb vector fields , therefore it is invariant to a free @xmath49 action , which is the case treated above ."
