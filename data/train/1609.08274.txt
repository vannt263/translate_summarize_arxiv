    "studying self - similar solutions that collapse in finite time is a topic of widespread interest in both the mathematical and the physical literature .",
    "the contexts range from scaling  @xcite , to focusing in prototypical dispersive equations such as the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation  @xcite and most notably the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation  @xcite on the one hand , and from droplets in thin films  @xcite and flow in porous media  @xcite to the roughening of crystal surfaces @xcite on the other .",
    "one may try to to avoid collapse ( e.g. by imposing space  @xcite or time modulations  @xcite ) or by identifying the higher order effects that preclude collapse in physical experiments  @xcite .",
    "one may alternatively explore what happens to the mathematical , computational ( or even physical  @xcite ) setting at , or past , the moment of collapse ; see , e.g. , the relevant chapter of  @xcite . with this latter intent , we start here from an array of simple , controllable examples and progressively explore more elaborate ones . our motivation is simple and , while also physical in part ( as in  @xcite , where the impact of collapse on optical filaments is sought ) , it is chiefly mathematical / computational . as collapse",
    "is approached in time , computations naturally break down and so also do , in part , mathematical approaches ; there are notable exceptions , e.g. efforts to explore beyond collapse , detailed in the book of  @xcite for nls , or in  @xcite for the porous medium problem .",
    "this breakdown has motivated extensive efforts to refine computational meshes  @xcite and avoid collapse at the numerical level ( possibly transforming into a co - exploding frame , thus factoring out the self - similarity  @xcite as will be discussed further below ) .",
    "such numerical approaches do not , however , possess the ability to cross infinity , even in a simpler array of examples in which we know by construction , or via analytical arguments , that `` life past infinity persists '' ( i.e. , that the solution does not cease to exist and can be continued past a singular point ) .",
    "this is precisely our aim here : we will propose how to numerically go beyond infinity as if it was a regular , rather than a singular point .",
    "we construct and apply , on demand , a singular transformation that  absorbs \" the singular nature of the dynamics , allowing the solution to re - emerge on the other side of infinity , where the dynamics becomes regular again .",
    "a complementary perspective that we explore in this regard is one of compactification transformations which place infinity on equal footing with the rest of the points in , e.g. , the ode orbit .    in ordinary differential equation ( ode )",
    "examples , an instantaneous encounter with infinity ( crossing or otherwise , as will be discussed below ) will be considered in what follows . in partial differential equation ( pde ) examples",
    ", however , the introduction of physical space leads to multiple possibilities ; one is that collapse might only occur at a single physical point / moment in time , with no subsequent continuous `` crossing '' of infinity .",
    "this is the so - called transient blowup in the insightful summary of  @xcite aiming at the classification ( see the discussion of item ( 5 ) therein ) of post - focusing regimes ; we will return to it in our discussion . a number of important examples have this structure , that will not be examined in detail here ( although we expect that the techniques proposed below are quite relevant in these cases too ) .",
    "instead , we will focus on the computationally intriguing case where , upon `` touching '' infinity at an initial point in space / time , the solution will start gradually crossing ; in one dimension this will generically result in two simultaneous crossings that emerge from the original encounter with infinity , and subsequently propagate apart in space / time .",
    "this poses computational challenges , as collapse persists in time ( there needs to be a singular transformation in some portion(s ) of the domain for entire time intervals ) , and it is also mobile ; we need to adaptively follow the region(s ) where the singular transformation is detected and accordingly performed as needed",
    ". it does not escape us that an additional possibility can be envisaged : finite _ spatial _ intervals of the solution ( possibly multiple ones simultaneously ) may become infinite , leading the regular part of the solution to be supported in compact regions , resembling so - called compacton structures originally introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this is referred to as `` incomplete blowup '' in  @xcite . remarkably , complexification of the evolving variable(s ) and how this may lead to a _",
    "regularization _ of the ( real ) collapsing dynamics naturally emerges as a potential `` variant '' of collapse .",
    "this is , arguably , a topic of interest in its own merit ; yet it connects naturally with the overall picture of approaching ( and potentially crossing ) infinity , and , as such , we will discuss it here .",
    "our presentation is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii , we will briefly outline our ode examples and their concomitant singular transformations , as well as issues of numerical computation and the notions of compactification , and of regularization via complexification . in section iii",
    "we will discuss one of the scenarios mentioned above in the case of a 1d pde .",
    "for this purpose , we `` engineer '' a transformation of a simple , 1d linear reaction - diffusion problem that exhibits the ",
    "single initial @xmath0 multiple mobile \" collapse point(s ) scenario ; we discuss and illustrate how to address that numerically .",
    "we show in this case too how complexification may lead to regularization .",
    "we then summarize our findings and present some conclusions and topics for future study .",
    "some relevant auxiliary notions are discussed in the appendix and the supporting information ( si ) .",
    "the standard textbook ode for collapse in finite time ( and its solution by direct integration ) reads : @xmath1 the collapse time @xmath2 , is fully determined by the initial condition , and the textbook presentation usually stops here .",
    "a numerical solver would overflow close to ( but before reaching ) @xmath3 ; yet we can bypass this infinity by appropriately transforming the dependent variable @xmath4 near the singularity . indeed , the `` good '' quantity @xmath5 , satisfies the `` good '' differential equation @xmath6 ; this equation will help `` cross '' the infinity ( for @xmath4 ) by crossing zero and smoothly emerging on the other side ( for @xmath7 ) .",
    "once infinity is crossed , we can revert to integrating the initial ( `` bad '' , but now tame again ) equation for @xmath4 .    to manifest the feature that infinity crossing",
    "should be thought of as being on equal footing with any other point on the rest of this orbit , we introduce a notion of compactification  @xcite .",
    "reshuffling the ( hyperbolic form of the ) solution , we have @xmath8 compactification through the variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 converts this hyperbola to a circle ; one can verify that indeed @xmath12 and @xmath13 and also that @xmath14 .",
    "this puts both relevant infinities @xmath15 on equal footing with all other points of the orbit along the circle .",
    "the trajectory between the point @xmath16 ( the infinity in @xmath17 , the steady state in @xmath4 ) and the point @xmath18 ( the infinity in @xmath4 ) can be thought of as reminiscent of a `` heteroclinic connection '' .",
    "such connections often arise in dynamical systems with symmetries ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the compactification also suggests that , provided we utilize `` the right variables '' , i.e. , the right quantities to observe the solution , ( e.g. , in the form of this circle ) we should obtain a consistent , smooth picture ( with consistent , smooth numerics ) . indeed , @xmath19 is a transformation in itself singular , yet one which converts the `` bad '' exploding variable @xmath20 into a `` good '' variable @xmath21 , satisfying @xmath6 that merely smoothly crosses @xmath22 .",
    "the following numerical protocol then naturally circumvents problems associated with infinity in a broad class of odes that collapse self - similarly , as power laws of time ( or , importantly , as we will see below including in the si , also _ asymptotically _ self - similarly ) :    * solve the `` bad '' ode of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) for a while , continuously monitoring , during the integration , its growth towards collapse . *",
    "if / when the approach to collapse is detected , estimate its ( asymptotically ) self - similar rate ( the exponent of the associated power law , here @xmath23 ) and use it to _ switch _ to a `` good '' equation for @xmath7 , relying on the singular transformation @xmath24 with this exponent ( and on continuity , to obtain appropriate initial data for this good equation ) .",
    "* run this `` good '' equation for @xmath7 until @xmath22 for it ( or @xmath25 for the former , `` bad '' equation ) is safely crossed , computationally observing for @xmath4 an ( asymptotically ) self - similar `` return '' from infinity . *",
    "finally , transform back to the `` bad '' equation ( no longer that bad , as infinity has been crossed ) and march it further forward in time .",
    "this protocol has been carried out in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( see caption ) , illustrating that the dynamics can cross infinity and computation can be continued for all time , provided that the self - similar approach to infinity is adaptively detected and the associated , and appropriately numerically estimated , singular transformation is used to cross it .",
    "note that the compactification also allows the progression past infinity _ in time _ too , when now @xmath7 crosses zero as time approaches positive infinity and then `` returns '' from negative infinity .",
    "we can now try to extend / generalize these ideas to other collapse rates ( i.e. arbitrary powers / exponents of self - similarity ) .",
    "the collapse of @xmath26 whose exact solution is @xmath27 is worth examining separately .",
    "the relevant singular transformation ( here @xmath28 ) will take us to infinity in finite time , but , at first sight , will not cross - @xmath21 becomes imaginary beyond @xmath3 .",
    "an appropriate compactificaton resolves the issue @xmath29 leading to perfectly regular dynamics on a circle , so that the singularity is again  bypassed \" in the spirit of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . yet",
    "an implicit multi - valuedness clearly arises as a crucial issue in selecting useful transformations for such exact solutions ; we will return to this important issue below .    for the time being , we argue that one can generalize the above notions for odes that asymptotically collapse self - similarly , @xmath30 , so as to produce a useful compactification in the form @xmath31 in this form , the dynamics `` benignly '' travels along the circle .",
    "relevant examples can straightforwardly be extended to , e.g. , fractional powers although it is known from standard ode analysis that issues of uniqueness may arise there that we do not delve into in the present work .",
    "more generally then , the self - similarly collapsing ode @xmath32 has the solution @xmath33 and its scaling in time follows @xmath34 , with the collapse time once again determined by the initial data .",
    "given a `` legacy code '' that integrates the ode @xmath35 , we monitor its growth approaching collapse ( i.e. , how @xmath36 scales as @xmath37 , or more generally with @xmath38 )  , although we will not explore such a case here . ] .",
    "upon detection of asymptotically self - similar collapse , at sufficiently large @xmath39 ( e.g @xmath40 in the ode of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , or @xmath41 in the pdes of the next section ) we stop solving the `` bad '' ode .",
    "we use instead the singular transformation @xmath42 ( more generally @xmath43 ) to solve the `` good '' @xmath21 ode that crosses @xmath22 rather than infinity .",
    "then , a little beyond the collapse time ( beyond infinity for @xmath20 , beyond @xmath22 for @xmath21 ) we simply revert to the original , `` bad '' ( yet no longer dangerous  ! ) ode , with continuity furnishing the relevant matching conditions .",
    "an illustration of asymptotically self - similar blowups , where different transformations are used to cross two different infinities ( the finite - time / infinite value and the infinite - time / finite value ones ) is included in the si .    examining such infinity crossings as regular , rather than singular points begs an `` explanation '' for the mechanism of exiting the real axis along @xmath44 and then re - emerging on the other side at @xmath45 ( for @xmath46 ) or -arguably more remarkably- from @xmath47 back towards the origin in the example involving @xmath48 ) . in the latter case",
    "there is an obvious ambiguity : the solution might just as well be chosen to re - emerge from @xmath49 : one can formally , past the collapse , accept @xmath50 for @xmath51 or , alternatively , @xmath52 . this is perhaps a prototypical ( and tangible ) example of the `` phase loss '' feature argued in  @xcite . as a way of shedding further light into these features , we examine the _ complexified version _ of eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "the complexified version @xmath53 leads to the two - dimensional dynamical system : @xmath54 the real axis is an invariant subspace , retrieving our real results ; yet complexification endows the dynamics with an intriguing `` capability '' : as fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] illustrates through the @xmath55 phase plane , collapse _ is avoided _ in the presence of a minuscule imaginary part .",
    "large `` elliptical - looking '' trajectories are traced on the phase plane , eventually returning to the neighborhood of the sole fixed point of @xmath56 which in the real case one would characterize as semi - stable. the system of eq .",
    "( [ eqn21 ] ) can be tackled in closed form since the ode @xmath53 yields @xmath57 . for @xmath58 ( @xmath59 )",
    "we obtain the explicit orbit formula @xmath60 eliminating time by dividing the two odes within eq .",
    "( [ eqn21 ] ) directly yields an ode for @xmath61 ( rather than the parametric forms of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn23])-([eqn24 ] ) ) . from this ode",
    ", one can obtain that the quantity @xmath62 is an invariant of the phase plane dynamics , and thus the latter can be written as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 .",
    "that is , the trajectory evolves along circles of radius @xmath65 in the upper ( resp .",
    "lower ) half - plane if @xmath66 ( resp .",
    "@xmath67 . )",
    "approaching the axis with @xmath68 , the curvature of these circles tends to @xmath22 and their radius to @xmath25 ( retrieving the real dynamics as a special case ) .",
    "[ fig2 ] through its planar projections illustrates not only the radial projection of the dynamics in the @xmath69 plane , but the @xmath70 and @xmath71 dependencies .",
    "starting with a minuscule imaginary part the real dynamics tends to infinity ; yet when the real part gets sufficiently large ( somewhat in the spirit of our computations above ) , the imaginary part `` takes over '' , grows rapidly , and `` chaperons '' the real part to the negative side .",
    "once the real part reaches the  opposite \" ( absolutely equal ) negative value , the imaginary part rapidly shrinks and the formerly bad , yet now benign real equation `` takes over '' again .",
    "we point out here that there is also a canonical way to generalize the compactification of this complex picture to the riemann sphere through the inverse stereographic projection @xmath72 now the real dynamics become a great geodesic circle , while all other complex plane curves become regular circles on the surface of the sphere . under this transformation",
    "all points with @xmath73 are identified with @xmath74 , rationalizing the vanishing time needed to move from one to the other .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we attempted to address here a few prototypical cases of a spectrum of problems arising in both ordinary and partial differential equations , so as to deal with the emergence of infinities during the evolution of the relevant models . in a number of cases the model at hand",
    "will become physically inaccurate , and will need to be suitably modified as these singular points are approached ; if not , our questions may be relevant for the physical realm . in any event , the questions are of particular relevance towards the mathematical analysis and numerical computation of the models at hand . in that light",
    ", we argued that it is possible in our context to perform singular transformations on demand , that may sidestep -through the help of a `` good equation''- the computational difficulties associated with infinities , rendering them tantamount to the crossing of a regular point such as zero .",
    "for ordinary differential equations , once the crossing has transpired , one can safely return to the original `` bad '' equation and continue the dynamics from there ( until possibly a new infinity is approached ) .    in the case of partial differential equations ,",
    "the scenario at hand is more complex .",
    "there , the solution is distributed in space , and hence we assume and have analyzed the setting where a ( generically assumed to be parabolic ; see the relevant discussion in the appendix ) tip of a waveform approaches infinity .",
    "we have discussed in detail a scenario of initially touching infinity and then crossing it .",
    "suitable computational `` buffers '' need then to be devised , where the detected singular transformation allows us to locally re - interpret ( for computational purposes ) the crossing of infinity as the crossing ( in a transformed space ) of a regular point , such as zero .",
    "these buffers need to be in constant and consistent communication , through appropriate continuity conditions , with the rest of the computational domain ( the `` rest of the world '' ) .",
    "typically , the buffers are defined by the location at which the solution takes on a sufficiently large ( absolute ) value - say @xmath41 to the left and right of the growing tip in the pre - crossing regime , or , say , @xmath41 till @xmath75 on the left , and @xmath76 till @xmath77 on the right in the post - crossing regime .",
    "our computational findings were complemented by a compactification approach , supporting the argument that infinity can be addressed in the same way as a regular point or a regular level set along the orbit . at the same time , a complexification of the model was observed to provide a regularization of the original real dynamics , avoiding the collapse of the latter and offering insight on how collapsing orbits can be envisioned as limiting scenarios of nonlinear dynamical systems within the complex plane .",
    "naturally , there are numerous directions of interest for potential future studies .",
    "clearly , exploring additional examples and examining whether the ideas can be equally successfully applied to them is of particular relevance . in the context of odes ,",
    "this is especially relevant as regards vector / multi - dimensional systems .",
    "a related , especially important part in the realm of odes is that of convergence of algorithms e.g. to fixed points ( or extremizers ) of functions .",
    "recall that in such cases , a concern always is whether the code may diverge along the way , rather than reach a root ( or an extremum ) .",
    "our approach can be used to devise algorithms with the ability to systematically bypass infinities during the algorithmic iterations- and such a `` boosted '' algorithm may be useful towards achieving enhanced , possibly global convergence to the roots ( or extrema ) of a function .",
    "this is particularly interesting now that continuous time versions of time - honored discrete algorithms like newton or nesterov iteration schemes have become a research focus ; see the related discussions in  @xcite .    on the pde side ,",
    "we are envisioning ( and currently starting to explore ) a multitude of emerging aspects .",
    "for instance , when a distributed waveform reaches infinity at a single point in space - time , different post - collapse outcomes are possible .",
    "for example , an alternative possibility to the infinity - crossing presented here has been argued to be that the solution may `` depart '' from infinity without crossing ( the transient blowup in  @xcite ) , as in the case of the standard collapsing nls equation discussed extensively in textbooks  @xcite .",
    "there , the crossing through infinity is precluded by the existence of conservation laws . past the initial point , it is argued in  @xcite that the solution will return from infinity incurring a `` loss of phase '' . at the bifurcation level , the work of  @xcite offers a suggestion of how the return from infinity manifests itself : there , a solution with a positive growth rate was identified , that was dynamically approached during the collapse stage . yet a partial  mirror image `` of that , with negative growth rate , which presumably is followed past the collapse point in order to return from infinity was also identified ; see , in particular , fig .  1 and especially fig .  2 of  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that such a ' ' touch and return `` from infinity may occur without the loss of phase as , e.g. , in the recent work of  @xcite . in examining a nonlocal variant of nls",
    "( motivated by @xmath78-symmetric considerations , i.e. , systems invariant under the action of parity and time - reversal ) , ref .",
    "@xcite identified a solution that goes to infinity in finite time that can be theoretically calculated ; subsequently this solution returns from infinity and then revisits infinity again , in a periodic way , always solely touching it and never crossing .",
    "this solution is analytically available in eq .",
    "( 22 ) of  @xcite and the collapse times are given by eq .",
    "( 23 ) therein ; perhaps even more remarkably , the model itself is integrable . in this case ,",
    "infinity is reached , subsequently returned from and then periodically revisited .",
    "such an observation would arise in our context if the ' ' original `` pde for @xmath79 ( i.e. , a variant of eq .",
    "( [ pdeqn8 ] ) ) had a spatiotemporal limit cycle that attained somewhere in space an extremal value @xmath80 .",
    "then , @xmath81 would feature the above phenomenology .",
    "such cases where infinity is reached but not crossed merit separate examination .",
    "the same is true for solutions exhibiting entire intervals at infinity , whose support progressively grows ( or anyway remains finite ) , bordered by moving ' ' fronts `` ; here one may envision that the ' ' good \" equation develops compacton - like solutions  @xcite . a related issue that may be worth exploring with such techniques is the possibility of bursting mechanisms ( e.g.  @xcite involving heteroclinic connections with entire invariant planes at infinity ) and the associated emergence of extreme events in nonlinear pdes .",
    "generalizations of the techniques developed herein to settings where , rather than @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( or this happens for other quantities associated with the dependent variable ) , as is , e.g. , the case during the formation of shocks , should also be interesting to explore . effectively , our considerations here can be thought of as identifying and numerically evolving the infinity level set of the solution .",
    "thus , a related interesting direction for future work could be to try to connect the considerations herein with ones of level set methods  @xcite , adapting the latter towards capturing , e.g. , the regions of the singular buffers .",
    "equally relevant are explicit examples similar to the one herein where multiple collapses may occur and propagate .",
    "an intriguing such case is the _ defocusing _ scenario of the nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath84 which , in fact , has been shown in  @xcite to possess solutions such as @xmath85 , or @xmath86 with propagating singularities at @xmath87 , and @xmath88 it is obvious that to follow such dynamical examples , a methodology bearing features such as the ones discussed above is needed in order to bypass the continuously propagating singular points . in turn , generalizing such notions to higher dimensions ( e.g. , a two - dimensional variant of the analytically tractable example herein ) and addressing collapsing waveforms both at points , as well as in more complex geometric examples such as curves  @xcite is of particular interest for future studies .",
    "it is tempting to explore whether the tools developed here may have something to add in the way we analyze collapse in well - established pdes like the navier - stokes , or even singularities arising in a cosmological context .",
    "several of these topics are under active consideration and we hope we will be able to report on them in future publications .",
    "* parabola self - similar crossing *    in the 1d case , starting from the assumption of a self - similar solution approaching infinity , we can prescribe a generic `` unimodal '' profile of the form : @xmath89 where @xmath3 is the collapse time and @xmath90 is the point around which the blowup solution is centered .    then , around @xmath91 ( and for @xmath92 ) , we can use a taylor expansion locally in the form : @xmath93 \\label{ceq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    combining the powers and bringing the dominant power to the left , we obtain that the field @xmath94 , defined as @xmath95 , \\label{ceq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] behaves like a `` regular '' field which crosses @xmath96 at @xmath91 , when @xmath97 .",
