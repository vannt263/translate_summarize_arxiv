    "the magnetically dominated plasma of the solar corona can support propagation of various types of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) waves .",
    "observations of these waves allow us to determine physical parameters of coronal structures that can not be measured directly via a technique called _ coronal seismology _ @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of the appropriate value of the polytropic index is important for understanding the energy transport and the relation between density , temperature and pressure in hydrodynamic and mhd models of the solar and stellar coronae as well as of space plasmas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast to the adiabatic index that is always 5/3 for an ideal monatomic gas ( or fully ionized ideal plasma ) , the polytropic index can have other values to account for the overall contribution of the different physical processes ( e.g. , heating , radiative cooling , and thermal conduction ) in the energy equation . from hinode / eis observations of propagating slow magnetoacoustic waves in a coronal loop ,",
    "@xcite estimated the polytropic index to be close to 1 , and suggested that thermal conduction is the dominant heat transport mechanism in the warm ( 12 mk ) corona .",
    "impulsive energy release in a closed magnetic structure ( so - called confined or non - eruptive flares ) provides a natural scenario for excitation of slow magnetoacoustic waves .",
    "this phenomenon was first discovered by the soho / sumer spectrometer in hot coronal loops as doppler shift oscillations in the flare lines ( * ? ? ?",

    "these oscillations were mainly interpreted as fundamental standing slow modes because their phase speed is close to sound speed in the loop , and there is a quarter - period phase shift between the velocity and intensity oscillations in some events @xcite .",
    "the initiation of the waves was often associated with small flares at the loop footpoint @xcite .",
    "these waves typically show a rapid decay .",
    "theoretical and numerical studies suggested that the dominant dissipation mechanisms are thermal conduction @xcite , compressive viscosity @xcite , and nonlinearity effect @xcite .",
    "these hot loop oscillation events are characterized by impulsive heating followed by a gradual cooling phase with similar features as solar flares , so also referred to as hot loop transient events ( hltes , * ? ? ?",
    "the hltes observed in multiple spectral lines formed at different temperatures have been used to diagnose the heating function by a forward modeling approach @xcite . in addition , the wave periods were also used to determine the loop magnetic field by coronal seismology @xcite .",

    "the waves have similar physical properties as hot loop oscillations observed by sumer @xcite , however , they bore the feature of bouncing back and forth in the heated loop , suggestive of a propagating wave .",
    "@xcite found the first aia wave event in agreement with a fundamental standing slow mode wave , and clear evidence for thermal conduction suppression in the hot ( @xmath19 mk ) flare loop by coronal seismology .",
    "they suggested that compressive viscosity dominates in the wave dissipation .",
    "it is known that the classical spitzer form of conductivity is valid under the assumptions that the electron velocity distribution is locally close to maxwellian and the mean free path @xmath5 is much smaller than the temperature gradient scale length @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "laboratory experiments and numerical studies showed that the actual conductivity is smaller ( by at least a factor of two ) than that given by spitzer when @xmath7 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is the case for typical solar flare loops with higher temperature ( @xmath2 ) because @xmath5 increases with @xmath8 .",
    "for example , for hot ( @xmath2=10 mk ) loops with the length @xmath9=10 mm and electron number density @xmath10 @xmath11 ( or @xmath9=100 mm and @xmath12 @xmath11 ) , we find @xmath13 . for a long - duration event ( lde ) with the slower - than - expected decay rate in soft x - ray ( sxr )",

    "figures[fig2](a ) and ( b ) show their temporal variations . by fitting to a damped sine - function with a parabolic trend , we measured the physical parameters of the wave and loop background plasma which are marked on the plots .",
    "we found that the temperature and density oscillations have similar periods and they are nearly in phase ( figs.[fig2](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "the phase shift measured using the cross correlation is about 12@xmath26 which corresponds to the data cadence of 24 s. this nearly inphase relationship may suggests an adiabatic process on the timescale of oscillations because otherwise a large phase shift between the temperature and density oscillations caused by the nonideal effects such as conductive loss at higher temperature plasma would be expected ( see paper i ) .",
    "we calculated the expected variation in temperature ( @xmath27 ) during an adiabatic process from the measured density variation ( @xmath17 ) using @xmath28 ( assuming the adiabatic index @xmath23=5/3 for fully ionized coronal plasma ) .",
    "we found that the expected and observed variations are in good agreement ( except for the near - ending time of 10 min , see fig.[fig2](c ) ) .",

    "note that to correctly apply eq.([eqalp ] ) to measure @xmath25 the phase shift between @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( if non - negligible ) should be first removed .",
    "figure[fig3 ] shows the linear - squares fitting for measurements of @xmath25 in the two cases : @xmath32 for all the data and @xmath33 for only the data with @xmath34 min , where the uncertainty is the 1@xmath14 error from the fit .",
    "we found that the measured values for @xmath25 are same as those in paper i. this indicates that the effect of nonlinearity is negligible , consistent with the signature that the temperature and density oscillations follow well the ( damped ) sinusoidal wave .",
    "we studied a longitudinal wave event triggered by the non - eruptive flare using sdo / aia .",
    "the waves in the hot flaring loop were identified as a fundamental standing slow mode .",
    "we analyzed the plasma thermal and wave properties of the oscillating loop , and found that its temperature and electron density variations are nearly in phase and the measured polytropic index @xmath25 agrees well with the adiabatic index of 5/3 for a fully ionized ideal plasma .",
    "these results imply that the mhd energy equation can be well represented with an adiabatic form , or the nonideal effects such as the stratification , optically thin radiative loss , and heat conduction are negligible during the oscillation period . in paper",
    "i , based on a 1d linear mhd model of slow waves , we argued that because thermal conduction dominates in the energy equation in the hot ( @xmath19 mk ) plasma , the interpretation suggests a significant reduction of thermal conductivity ( by at least a factor of 3 as estimated quantitatively ) .",
    "the dissipation of slow waves by thermal conduction is due to temperature variations along the loop caused by the wave , while thermal conduction causes the hot loop cooling due to its rooting on the cool chromosphere .",
    "now that thermal conduction is suppressed as known from the wave analysis , its influence on the loop cooling would also be expected .",
    "figure[fig4 ] shows that the observed cooling timescales ( calculated by @xmath35 ) is about a factor 24 longer than the cooling timescales based on spitzer s thermal conductivity ( @xmath36 using eq.(d2 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "this slower - than - expected cooling rate can be explained by conduction suppression which has a suppression factor consistent with that inferred from the wave analysis . for the mean temperature and density",
    ", we obtained @xmath37 where @xmath6 is taken as the loop length @xmath9 . under the nonlocal conduction approximation @xcite , we calculated the modified spitzer cooling timescales by @xmath38 .",
    "figure[fig4 ] shows a good agreement between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , suggesting that the nonlocal conduction in hot plasmas may account for the observed conduction suppression in this event .",
    "in addition , the thermal conduction suppression mechanism may be used to explain the phenomenon that the larger ( solar and stellar ) flares tend to be hotter than expected by the em-@xmath2 relation where @xmath2 is the peak temperature and em the volume emission measure @xcite . assuming the balance between conduction cooling and reconnection heating and the pressure balance for flare loops , @xcite derived the scaling law @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the magnetic field strength .",
    "if considering the suppressed conductivity @xmath43 where @xmath44 cgs is the classical spitzer conductivity and @xmath45 the suppression factor , we obtained the modified scaling law @xmath46 as well as the relations @xmath47 and @xmath48 . given @xmath45=3 , for instance , we estimated that the conduction suppression would lead to the flare loop hotter by about a factor 1.5 ; if the conduction suppression effect is neglected , the magnetic field strength of stellar flares may be overestimated by a factor of 2 from fitting the observed em-@xmath2 diagram .",
