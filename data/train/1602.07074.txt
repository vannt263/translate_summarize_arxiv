    "polymer confinement in nano - scale geometries has become a problem of interest in recent years .",
    "this phenomenon has applications in the design of nanotechnology devices , such as polymer separation , dna sequencing , and protein sensing @xcite .",
    "it is also a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological environments .",
    "packaging of the viral genome in the capsid @xcite and its ejection into the host cell @xcite , translocation of rna through nuclear pores and protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum are known examples @xcite .",
    "advances in the fabrication of nano - structures for polymer confinement have also lead to considerable achievements in polymer physics .",
    "entropic effects on polymers arisen from confinement were first observed in 1999 @xcite .",
    "polymer translocation is the passage of a polymer through a nano - pore in a membrane . to date , biological nano - channels have been used for dna sequencing purposes ; while solid - state nano - pores are of interest as a tool for single - molecule studies .",
    "the two protein channels used for dna sequencing are @xmath0-hemolysin and mspa @xcite .",
    "when dna passes through the cylindrical part of the @xmath0-hemolysin channel , the ionic current through the channel depends on 10 - 15 nucleotides that reside inside the channel .",
    "however , the protein channel mspa has a conical shape and the ionic current depends on few nucleotides near the cone tip .",
    "indeed , the electric field is focused in the tip of a cone shaped channel , which also pronounces the difference between the ionic current signals received from the four nucleotides @xcite .    for interaction between polymers and cone - shaped structures ,",
    "other biological and technological examples can be counted : the hiv-1 capsid which confines its viral genome has a cone - shaped structure @xcite , coating of the conical nano - pores with dna is used for tuning their ionic properties @xcite , and asymmetric conical pores are shown to act as brownian ratchets for colloids @xcite and polymers @xcite .",
    "in addition , there exist cases that the polymer is confined inside a cone as a result of interaction with the surrounding polymers @xcite or a hydrodynamic flow @xcite",
    ".    polymers confined near surfaces and inside different geometries such as cylindrical and cone - shaped nano - channels , nano - slits and nano - spheres have been studied ( ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "generally , confinement reduces the number of possible configurations of the polymer and causes its entropy to decrease . for a polymer near a surface",
    ", confinement leads to entropic forces on the polymer which are measurable with the enhanced sensitivity of current experimental devices ( e.g. afm and optical tweezers ) @xcite .",
    "entropic forces are also the main driving force for polymer escape from confined geometries @xcite . for a polymer in an asymmetric confinement such as a cone , difference in the entropy of the polymer in the two sides results in an entropic force on the polymer toward the larger side @xcite .        in a previous work",
    ", the authors studied the translocation of a flexible polymer through a cone - shaped nano - channel , using md simulations .",
    "it was shown that the entropic force from the cone results in a forced polymer translocation .",
    "the passage time was shown to have a non - monotonic dependence on the cone angle and a slight dependence on the cone length .",
    "a theoretical description was developed for a flexible polymer inside a cone .",
    "small and large cone angles were studies separately , because of the crowding effect in front of the nano - channel in small angles . the number of monomers inside the nano - channel and the entropic force was obtained for a polymer inside a closed cone and inside an open cone - shaped channel .",
    "it was shown that the theory can explain the translocation time dependence on the cone angle and length , qualitatively @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to further investigate a polymer confined inside a cone - shaped nano - channel . a flexible polymer that one of its ends is fixed inside the channel is studied by two different sets of simulations . in the first set ,",
    "the channel is so long that the polymer is completely confined inside it ( case i ) .",
    "extension of the polymer along the channel axis and the entropic force on the polymer are studied in these simulations .",
    "it is seen that the polymer extension along the channel rapidly decreases with the cone angle .",
    "however , the force has no considerable dependence on the channel angle and the polymer length . in the second set of simulations ,",
    "the polymer is so long that more than half of the monomers lie outside the channel ( case ii ) .",
    "the number of monomers that remain inside the channel and the force on the polymer are investigated , in this case .",
    "the number of monomers inside the channel is found to increase with the channel angle , especially for longer channels .",
    "however , the force dependence on the channel length is ignorable . despite the case",
    "i , dependence of the force on the channel angle is considerable , in these simulations .",
    "these results on the dependence of the force on the properties of the cone - shaped channel can be important in the design of nano - pores for practical purposes .",
    "the force arisen from the asymmetric shape of the channel on the polymer is around four times the force from thermal fluctuations .",
    "so , its effects on the polymer behavior in experimental conditions can be significant which is explained in details in this manuscript .",
    "the results of md simulations are also used to check the correctness of the theoretical framework developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , quantitatively .",
    "it is shown that the four sets of data obtained from the cases i and ii can be fitted with the theoretical functions , with only three fit parameters .",
    "the theory also explains the distribution of monomers inside the channel .",

    ", the entropic force reaches to its highest value at @xmath87 and then plateau .",
    "the local maximum of the translocation time is observed around this angle and then there is a plateau in larger angles . in the previous study ,",
    "the translocation time had a weak dependence on the channel length , in agreement with the results of the present study .    according to the present simulation results , the force from the channel has a maximum around @xmath88 , where @xmath6 is the monomer size .",
    "if we consider the translocating polymer to be single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) , the size of the coarse - grained monomers is around @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "so , the entropic force from the cone can be as large as @xmath90 , which can be considerable in practical situations .",
    "in experiments , the mspa protein channel has an apex angle around @xmath91 and an opening diameter of @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "ssdna is usually entered into the mspa through its base , using an applied electric voltage .",
    "it is possible to immobilize the strand inside the nano - channel , using a hairpin construct at one end @xcite or a dna polymerase @xcite .",
    "the entropic force on the immobilized ssdna from the mspa channel can be calculated theoretically from eq .",
    "[ fl2 ] , which is approximately equal to @xmath90 .",
    "although a detailed knowledge of the electric field inside the cone - shaped channel is required to find the electric force , it can be estimated using the relation @xmath93 .",
    "most of the applied electric voltage @xmath94 falls on the narrow constriction of the cone - shaped nano - channel and one can assume an effective length for the nano - channel @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 is the total charge of the nucleotides that are inside this effective length .",
    "each nucleotide has 0.3 nm length and one electron charge , @xmath97 .",
    "the applied voltage difference that gives an electric force equal to the entropic force from the channel can be obtained as @xmath98 .",
    "experimentally , the threshold voltage required to keep ssdna inside the mspa channel can be measured .",
    "the threshold voltage depends on the entropic contributions both from the nano - channel and the membrane containing the nano - channel .",
    "an immobilized polymer inside a nano - channel can be divided into three segments : the segment inside the channel and the two arms outside the channel .",
    "each of the two outside arms of the polymer is nearly fixed on the wall containing the nano - channel .",
    "the wall reduces the available configurations for the polymer and thus exerts an entropic force on the polymer @xcite .",
    "comparison between the threshold voltage of mspa and that of a cylindrical nano - channel can be used to separate the two entropic contributions .",
    "ssdna fixed inside a cylindrical nano - channel ( such as @xmath0-hemolysin ) feels only the entropic force from the wall and can be used as a reference to find the entropic force from the mspa channel .    in the experiments of ssdna translocation through mspa , the voltage difference @xmath99 is often used which gives an electric force equal to @xmath100 on the strand .",
    "the polymer is often entered from the base of the cone - shaped channel , to achieve higher capture rates @xcite . in this condition , the entropic force from the channel acts against the direction of the polymer entry and can reduce the capture rate . however , non - equilibrium effects are determining in polymer translocation .",
    "the polymer becomes stretched when it enters the pore @xcite and the monomers crowd close to the pore after the passage .",
    "as ssdna enters from the base of the mspa channel , crowding does not alter the entropic force but stretching can reduce interaction of the polymer with the channel walls and decrease the entropic force .",
    "finally , the theory and the simulation results for the polymer configuration and the entropic force on the polymer inside a cone - shaped channel are in good agreement .",
    "the simulation results are well fitted with theoretical functions .",
    "it was shown that the entropic force from the channel can be significant in ssdna translocation through mspa channel .",
    "in these experiments , the entropic force depends on the angle and the tip diameter of the channel , and not on the channel length .",
    "it means that changing the angle of the cone - shaped channel may have a determining role in polymer translocation but changing the channel length has no noticeable effects .",
    "this point can be considered in the design of cone - shaped channels through protein engineering @xcite , or through solid state methods in fabricating solid - state cone - shaped channels @xcite . in some experiments ,",
    "the polymers are used to alter transport properties of cone - shaped nano - channels @xcite .",
    "distribution of monomers and the polymer extension inside the cone - shaped nano - channel are important in these experiments .",
    "the obtained results give a detailed view on these quantities ."
