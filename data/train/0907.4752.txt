    "to derive abundances of these molecular absorptions with respect to the hydrogen and solid h@xmath0o column densities , we followed the procedure in @xcite to fit the h@xmath0o ice and silicate absorption profiles to sl and ll spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : continuum ] shows an example for sstgc  797384 .",
    "we used the silicate absorption profiles in the line of sight to the gc ( gcs  3 spectrum ; * ? ? ?",

    "fit separately after fixing the continuum and extinction to previously found values , is an upper limit because the @xmath136 m absorption is not solely due to h@xmath0o ice .",
    "we adopted the integrated line strengths @xmath186 for the bending mode and @xmath187 for the librational mode @xcite .",
    "errors in these parameters ( table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) are formal estimates made by varying the range of wavelengths that we used for the @xmath134 m silicate fitting , or by taking a few different ways of setting the continuum .",

    "our derived abundances of @xmath188@xmath189 for c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn are comparable to those found for massive ysos @xcite , although abundances for sstgc  524665 have large errors .",
    "intervening molecular clouds in the line of sight to the gc are less likely the main cause of these absorptions , because the average hcn abundance of @xmath190 @xcite towards sgr  b2(m ) is an order of magnitude lower than our measurements .",

    "both sstgc  797384 and sstgc  803187 have higher @xmath116 values than the average for field stars , implying that a significant fraction of the attenuation is intrinsic to the source .",
    "sstgc  524665 has a lower @xmath116 , comparable to the average value for surrounding field stars .",
    "we also note that sstgc  524665 is located at @xmath196 , so it is possible that it is in front of the gc .",
