    "the existence of quark matter or quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) which is the fundamental theory of hadronic world . it is supposed that the quark matter may exist in the early stage of the universe or in the core of the compact stars .",
    "recently such a new state of matter has been explored in the high - energy heavy ion collisions ( rhic ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "now it is very important to study the various physical properties of the quark matter in relation to these researches .    several years ago one of the present authors ( m.i .",
    ") studied the specific heat and compressibility of the quark matter by using the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite .",
    "these quantities are enhanced near the critical temperature . on the other hand",
    "the transport coefficients , shear viscosity and heat conductivity , are also important in relation to the high - energy heavy ion collisions .",
    "recently it was discovered that the quark matter seems to be almost perfect fluid above the critical temperature .",
    "therefore the calculation of the shear viscosity has been paid attention by many authors from the various viewpoints @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite(lattice qcd ) , @xcite-@xcite(black hole physics ) .    in this paper",
    "we try to calculate the shear viscosity of the quark matter by using the kubo formula and the njl model .",
    "we start to discuss the shear viscosity in terms of the kubo formula @xcite-@xcite , which is expressed by the correlation function of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "suppose that the quark system in the qgp is a free gas .",
    "then the shear viscosity becomes _ infinite _ because of the strong correlation between their current densities . on the other hand",
    "the rhic data suggests very small viscosity . in order to clarify the physical origin of this small viscosity",
    ", we consider the shear viscosity of quark sector with the use of the njl model , which does not include gluons explicitly . in the previous paper ( referred to as i ) , the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( rpa ) was applied to this formula and it was shown that the shear viscosity is represented by the quadratic form of the quark spectral function @xcite .",
    "consequently it is the main purpose of this paper to calculate the spectral function within the njl model and obtain the values of the shear viscosity under the various temperature and density .",
    "the spectral function is related to the self energy of the quark .",
    "in particular it depends on its imaginary part ( or mean free path ) strongly .",
    "what interaction does enhance the self energy ?",
    "here we are reminded of the soft mode , which was proposed as a precursor of the chiral phase transition by hatsuda and kunihiro long time ago @xcite .",
    "these modes grow strongly just above the critical temperature which is just the region we are interested in .",
    "we think that the collective mode couples strongly to the quark .",
    "we calculate the self energy of the quark due to the coupling to the soft modes . as is pointed out in @xcite , the spectral function of the soft mode decreases as the temperature increases .",
    "this means that the shear viscosity seems to be enhanced as the temperature increases .",
    "we will investigate the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity as well as the density dependence .",
    "finally we calculate the reynolds number of the quark matter in order to discuss the magnitude of the calculated shear viscosity .    in the next section",
    ", it is reviewed that the shear viscosity is expressed in terms of the quark spectral function , which is the main result of i. then the spectral function is represented by the self energy of the quark (  .3 ) . in ",
    ".4 , the main part of this paper , we calculate the self energy by using the coupling to the soft modes in the quark matter .",
    "the numerical calculations are carried out and their results are discussed in the final section (  .5 ) .",
    "the kubo formulas for the hydrodynamic transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the correlation function of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath2 . according to i , the formula for shear viscosity",
    "is given by @xmath3where @xmath4 is a retarded green s function obtained by analytic continuation of the following ( imaginary time ) green s function : @xmath5 , @xmath6here @xmath7 is the matsubara frequency for bosons and @xmath8 means the ( imaginary ) time ordering operator .",
    "we take the njl model for the quark matter in this paper @xcite",
    ". then the lagrangian density is given by @xmath9\\ ; \\label{eq : njl_lag},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the field operator for quarks and @xmath11 is their coupling constant .",
    "we assume that the current quark mass is zero ( @xmath12 ) for convenience .",
    "the canonical energy - momentum tensor is read as @xmath13\\ ; \\label{eq : energy_mom}.\\ ] ] when this equation is substituted into eq.([eq : im_green ] ) , we have an infinite series for the correlation function @xmath14 .    according to i , we approximate the higher orders by the ring diagrams shown in fig.[fig : ring_diagrams_1 ] ( random phase approximation ) .     with @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "]    as is shown in i , the higher order terms which consists of two loops or more vanish . because the leftist ( rightist ) loop of each diagram contains odd number of @xmath17 matrices and its trace vanishes .",
    "thus only the first term of fig.1 survives .",
    "the correlation function is written as @xmath18\\ ;   \\label{eq : matsubara_sum},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath19 denotes the dressed quark propagator . if the free propagator is substituted instead of the dressed one , we have an infinite viscosity .",
    "so finite viscosity comes from the finite life time of the quark or finite mean free path in the present model . the spectral representation for the dressed propagator is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the matsubara frequency for fermions .",
    "substituting this expression into the correlation function eq.([eq : matsubara_sum ] ) , we obtain the expression of @xmath22 in terms of quark spectral function as follows : @xmath23\\ ;   \\label{eq : viscosity_spectral}.\\ ] ] here @xmath24 denotes the fermi distribution function ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the detailed derivation of this equation was given in i. the factor @xmath26 in the right - hand side implies that the shear viscosity is crucially affected by the distribution function near the fermi surface .",
    "next we calculate the spectral function of quarks . the spectral function is defined by @xmath27\\;,\\ ] ] where the retarded and advanced green s function are written as    @xmath28    the full green s function @xmath29 is expressed in terms of the self energy @xmath30 as follows @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the free green s function . here",
    "we introduce the projection operators for positive and negative energy states , @xmath33 .",
    "according to h.a.weldon @xcite , the free green s function @xmath34 is written as a sum of two ( positive and negative ) parts .",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37chemical potential ) .",
    "similarly , the self energy can be written as    [ eq : se ] @xmath38    by substituting eq.([eq : free_gf ] ) and ( [ eq : se ] ) into eq.([eq : gf_se ] ) , we obtain the expressions ,    [ eq : gf_r&a ] @xmath39    here we used the following formula , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are arbitrary variables . by using these expressions , the spectral function @xmath43 is rewritten as follows : @xmath44 where the coefficients @xmath45 are defined by @xmath46    thus the spectral function is written in terms of self energy . in other words , our calculation of the shear viscosity is reduced to that of the quark self energy . it is instructive to notice that if there is no interaction , the spectral function is simply given by @xmath47 in this case , the viscosity @xmath22 obviously diverges , which indicates that the quark interaction is essential for realizing finite viscosity .",
    "in order to obtain finite shear viscosity , we have to know the self energy of quark @xmath30 . as the largest contribution to the self energy",
    ", we assume that the self energy is acquired by the coupling to the soft modes , which are predicted in the scheme of the njl model @xcite,@xcite . the soft mode is a collective mode of quark - antiquark pair above @xmath48 as shown in fig.[fig : soft_modes ] .",
    "the existence of such mode is one of the precursor phenomena of the chiral transition and it behaves as a bosonic quasi - particle .",
    "as the soft modes are carriers of chirality , isospin and energy momentum , it is likely that the modes affect various transport coefficients including viscosity .",

    "we are now ready to evaluate the shear viscosity at various temperature and density .",
    "the parameters of the njl model are taken to be the same values as those in the reference @xcite : the coupling constant , @xmath113 and the cut off parameter , @xmath114 .",
    "the quark mass @xmath115 is assumed to be zero so that the chiral symmetry holds exactly .",
    "first we restrict ourselves to the case of the chemical potential @xmath116 .",
    "note that the rhic data covers @xmath117 . under these parameters ,",
    "the critical temperature @xmath118 is @xmath119 , which is derived from the vanishing condition of the inverse propagator of the soft mode : @xmath120 @xcite .      to begin with ,",
    "let us consider the soft mode in the quark matter .",
    "its spectral functions @xmath121 are calculated from eq.(35 ) and the results are shown in fig.4 at various temperatures : @xmath122 . for @xmath123 very close to @xmath118 ,",
    "the soft mode becomes a sharp resonance and acquires the nature of a good quasi - particle .",
    "as the temperature increases , the resonance width is spread out and its strength is weakened at @xmath124 .     as a function of the frequency of the soft mode . ]    as is pointed out by hatsuda and kunihiro , this peak near the critical temperature reflects a precursor of the chiral phase transition .",
    "therefore its existence implies that the system is in the restored chiral symmetry phase or qgp phase . in fig.5",
    ", we present the spectral functions with various momenta at @xmath125 .     as a function of the frequency of the soft mode ( @xmath125 ) . ]",
    "the position of the peak does not depend on the momentum @xmath126 but the strength depends on @xmath126 or the temperature @xmath123 .",
    "hence the soft mode is determined by the temperature .",
    "it will be shown later that the soft mode is not sensitive to the chemical potential .",
    "next let us calculate the self energy of the quark , which is described by the coupling to the soft modes as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of @xmath30 do not depend on the momentum @xmath126 sensitively as well as the soft mode .",
    "we show the spectral function of quark in fig.6 .",
    "( @xmath127 ) , which is generated by the coupling to the soft mode . ]",
    "they have a broad and small peak except for the case of @xmath128 .",
    "the position of the broad peak moves with the momentum such that the denominator in eq.(16 ) is minimized .",
    "the sharp peak near @xmath129 at @xmath128 seems to come from the overlap between two spectral functions , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we see that the strength of the spectral functions are suppressed due to the integration of the momentum @xmath132 .",
    "this behavior lowers the shear viscosity as shown in the next subsection .",
    "now we can calculate the shear viscosity by using eq.(7 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig.7 as a function of the temperature above the critical one , @xmath133 .",
    "similarly its ratio to the entropy is drawn in fig.8 .",
    "the solid lines in these figures represent guidelines for the data .",

    "( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the dashed line denotes for result by the particle mode explained in the text . ]",
    "these values are almost constant but increase gradually at @xmath134 .",
    "the smallness of the shear viscosity is understood by the smallness of the quark spectral function as shown in fig.6 .",
    "this comes from the strong coupling to the soft modes , which gives rise to the large self energy , that is the short mean free path . as the temperature increases ,",
    "the soft mode becomes weak and its peak moves to the high frequency ( fig.4 ) .",
    "then the quark spectral function is enhanced .",
    "this is the reason that the shear viscosity increases gradually at @xmath135 .    for the comparison",
    ", we also calculated the shear viscosity by the coupling to the particle mode .",
    "this mode represents that the quark collides with another particle instead of the soft mode .",
    "the feynman diagram of this process corresponds to the second diagram of the fig.3 .",
    "hence the spectral function of this mode is given by @xmath136 the calculated result is denoted by the dashed line in fig.7 and 8 .",
    "we see that the viscosity by the particle mode is one - order larger than those by the soft mode .",
    "this means that the particle mode gives rise to the weak correlation between quarks and makes the quark matter fermi gas - like .",
    "this property is seen in the spectral function of the particle mode as shown in fig.9 .",
    "( @xmath127 ) , which is generated by the coupling to the particle mode . ]",
    "next let us discuss the density or chemical potential dependence of the shear viscosity .",
    "the shear viscosity for @xmath137 is shown in fig.10 .",
    "the viscosity is increasing very slowly with the chemical potential .",
    "this dependence is understood by noting that the soft mode is not changed for the chemical potential as shown in fig.11 at @xmath125 .",
    "( @xmath127 ) . ]     as a function of the frequency of the soft mode ( @xmath125 ) . ]",
    "finally we will discuss how small the shear viscosity obtained in this paper is .",
    "to this end , let us introduce ( dimensionless ) reynolds number which is defined by @xmath138 in the numerator , @xmath139 and @xmath140 denote typical size and velocity of the system , respectively .",
    "we set @xmath141 and @xmath142 for convenience .",
    "it is difficult to define  mass density @xmath143 \" appeared in the denominator . here",
    "we have defined it by the qusi - particle mass @xmath115 times number density of the quark and antiquark .",
    "if we set @xmath144 , the reynolds number becomes @xmath145 on the other hand , @xmath146 in the case of the coupling to the particle mode .",
    "taking into account that the shear viscosity is negligible under the large @xmath147 , the evaluated @xmath147 implies that our quark matter is close to a perfect liquid due to the strong coupling to the soft mode .      in conclusion",
    ", we have evaluated the shear viscosity of the quark matter ( qgp ) by using the kubo formula and the njl model .",
    "the self energy of quark is calculated by the coupling to the soft mode which is a collective mode composed of the quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this strong correlation of quarks lowers the shear viscosity of the quark matter and the quark matter is nearly a perfect fluid . as the temperature increases , the shear viscosity increases gradually because the strength of the soft modes decreases with the temperature .",
    "on the other hand it is shown that the shear viscosity is not sensitively depend on the chemical potential .",
    "the authors would like to thank professors y.tsue and k.iida ( kochi university ) for valuable comments and discussions .",
    "they also thank the yukawa institute for theoretical physics at kyoto university .",
    "discussions during the yitp workshop yitp - w-04 - 07 on thermal quantum field theories and their applications and the ykis2006 on `` new frontiers qcd '' were very useful to start and complete this work .",
