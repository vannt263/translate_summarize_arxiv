    "<S> the pl scans in fig.[fig : setup](b ) show the anticrossing characteristic of strong coupling between the qd and the cavity . here , the qd is tuned into resonance using local temperature tuning@xcite around an average temperature of 20 k maintained in a continuous flow cryostat . </S>",

    "<S> the measurement on the reflected port from this single - sided cavity is analogous to a transmission measurement in a fabry perot arrangement .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy eigenstates of a two - level system strongly coupled to an optical resonator are grouped into two - level manifolds denoted @xmath3 , with energies @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of energy quanta in the system and @xmath6 is the bare cavity frequency ( fig.[fig : theory](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the anharmonic energy level spacing causes phenomena such as photon blockade@xcite or photon - induced tunneling . to observe photon blockade , a coherent probe beam ( frequency @xmath7 ) tuned at @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> is coupled to the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> this probe is resonant with the first - order manifold , but detuned from transitions to the second manifold , @xmath9 as shown in fig.[fig : theory](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , once a photon is coupled into the system , it suppresses the probability of coupling a second photon with the same frequency . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the output field acquires sub - poissonian statistics with second - order correlation @xmath10 , as recently demonstrated by birnbaumm et al@xcite in an experiment with neutral atoms .     and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> photon blockade is expected at @xmath12 because the absorption of a photon into @xmath13 suppresses the probability of absorbing a second photon of the same energy for a transition to @xmath14 . as @xmath15 the absorption of a photon into the first manifold enhances the absorption probability into higher order manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) computed second - order correlation @xmath16 for a coherent laser probe reflected from the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> inset shows that photon blockade is expected when the probe detuning is @xmath17 ( and not @xmath18 ) because of the finite linewidth of the polaritons . as @xmath19 the output field is bunched . </S>",

    "<S> the value for ( @xmath21 ) drops rapidly for time delays greater than @xmath22ps , corresponding to the cavity photon lifetime.,width=336 ]    in addition to photon blockade , photon - induced tunneling is expected near the bare cavity resonance ( @xmath23 ) : the absorption of a first photon enhances the absorption of subsequent photons so the output consists of `` photon bunches . '' in fig.[fig : theory](b ) we show the output spectrum as the probe is tuned through the cavity and mark the resonance of the transitions @xmath24 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated driving field injects an average photon number @xmath25 when resonant with the polaritons in the first manifold , thus causing a slight saturation of the qd dipole . as @xmath15 , the probability of absorbing the first photon decreases . </S>",
    "<S> however , if a photon is nevertheless absorbed , it enhances the probability of capturing the second photon . </S>",
    "<S> this process produces a photon - bunched output . </S>",
    "<S> this intuitive explanation can be extended in the same way to include higher order manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> the expected second - order correlation function for our system is shown in fig.[fig : theory](c ) , where we plot the dependence of @xmath16 for different detunings @xmath26 of the probe from the anticrossing frequency @xmath27 . as expected from the intuitive argument above </S>",
    "<S> , the simulation predicts photon bunching as @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> photon blockade is evident in the antibunched region near @xmath28 ( see inset of fig.[fig : theory](c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the blockade does not occur for @xmath29 as previously explained , but at @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the linewidth of the eigenstates ( @xmath30 ) is comparable to the splitting of the manifolds ( @xmath31 ) , resulting in significant overlap of the allowed transitions between consecutive manifolds .        </S>",
    "<S> we measure the time - dependent autocorrelation @xmath21 using the hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) setup shown in fig.[fig : setup](a ) and described in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant features occur at the qd - cavity coupling rate @xmath32 , enveloped by the coherence time@xcite , as shown in fig.[fig : theory](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the coherence time for our system is given by the cavity photon lifetime @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the time - dependent features in @xmath21 occur much faster than the 300 ps time - resolution of the single photon counting modules in the hbt setup . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we sample the autocorrelation function by short pulses ( @xmath34 ps , @xmath35 ghz ) with a repetition rate of @xmath36ns . </S>",
    "<S> this probe pulse duration forms a compromise between fast sampling and a spectral linewidth narrow enough to resolve the relevant spectral features . in the remainder of the paper we present </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of @xmath21 for different detunings of the probe beam , denoted as @xmath37 .    to observe photon blockade and photon - induced tunneling , we measured the second - order correlation at detunings @xmath38 and @xmath39 as shown fig.[fig : antibunch ] . </S>",
    "<S> the expected photon antibunching and bunching behavior is clearly visible at zero time delay ( fig.[fig : antibunch](b , d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the histograms also show bunching over timescales of hundreds of nanoseconds . this bunching results not from the quantum nature of the system , but from blinking behavior of the qd . as reported by santori et al@xcite , such blinking behavior between a _ bright _ and a _ dark _ state results in bunching near t=0 , with a characteristic fall - off rate given by the mean switching rate . </S>",
    "<S> our observations indicate that the blinking rates vary for different qds and for different probe powers , and the quantum dot spends @xmath40 of the time in the _ bright _ state .    </S>",
    "<S> photon blockade and photon - induced tunneling are quantified by the normalized second - order correlation function @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> each peak in the histogram of fig.[fig : antibunch ] represents the unnormalized value of @xmath37 averaged over the pulse duration of 40 ps . </S>",
    "<S> we express this time averaging by using the notation @xmath41 . because of the qd blinking there are two choices for the normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> one choice is to normalize such that @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> we keep the notation @xmath41 for this normalized quantity ( fig.[fig : antibunch](b ) ) . we stress that @xmath41 captures both the quantum and classical nature ( i.e. blinking ) of the output field . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization constant @xmath43 for @xmath41 is determined by fitting the histogram with the function @xmath44}+ \\overline{g}^{(2)}_{\\infty}$ ] for @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath46 represents the number of counts at time @xmath47 , where @xmath48 indexes the peak number with @xmath49 corresponding to @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ns is the pulse repetition period . the other choice of normalization constant is @xmath52 , which is equivalent to normalizing to the nearest neighbor peaks at @xmath53 ns . when referring to this normalization we use the notation @xmath54 ( fig.[fig : antibunch](b ) ) . the time - dependence in @xmath37 on the time scale of 12.5 ns is due almost exclusively to the fast interaction between probe and qd and is only negligibly affected by the comparatively slow qd blinking process . </S>",
    "<S> thus the nearest - neighbor normalized @xmath54 better captures the photon blockade ( @xmath55 ) and photon - induced tunneling ( @xmath56 ) effects .     for different detunings between the probe and the anticrossing frequency . </S>",
    "<S> as the probe is tuned through the resonance of the qd - cavity system , the output field shows antibunched and bunched behavior as it transitions from photon blockade regime to photon - induced tunneling regime . the fit takes into account the finite pulse - width of the probe , qd blinking and background due to the imperfect extinction of the cross - polarized setup . in the bottom - right corner </S>",
    "<S> we show the relative width of the pulsed laser probe.,width=336 ]    in the case of photon blockade , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( fig.[fig : antibunch](b ) ) , showing the antibunched quantum nature of the system for both choices of normalization . for photon - induced tunneling , @xmath59 and @xmath60 ( fig.[fig : antibunch](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> these values are different from the ideal theoretical prediction in fig.[fig : theory](c ) because of the background noise caused by the imperfect extinction of the cross - polarized experimental setup ( signal to noise ratio @xmath61 ) , qd blinking and finite bandwidth of the probe . both the background and the output signal when the qd is in the _ dark _ state have @xmath62 .    </S>",
    "<S> we repeated the autocorrelation measurements for a large set of detunings to map the full spectrum of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of the full autocorrelation spectrum entails several challenges such as sample drift resulting in fluctuating coupling intensity into the cavity , and fluctuating temperature . to map the dependence of @xmath63 on probe detuning </S>",
    "<S> , we took care to maintain constant coupling into the cavity mode for the full duration of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> our most consistent data set is presented in fig.[fig : g2spec ] where we plot @xmath63 for different detunings of the probe frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we kept a constant probe power of @xmath64 nw before the objective lens corresponding to an average cavity photon number @xmath25 , and the coupling was re - optimized for every data point . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest value for @xmath63 obtained in this data set is not as antibunched as the value @xmath65 reported in fig.[fig : antibunch](b ) , mainly because we could not reproduce exactly the same coupling conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the data in fig.[fig : g2spec ] is well fitted by a numerical model that takes into account pulses of finite bandwidth , qd blinking and background from the imperfect extinction of the cross - polarized setup ( see methods section for details ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data in fig.[fig : g2spec ] shows that this strongly coupled system allows control of the statistics of the output field from sub - poissonian to super - poissonian . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the probability of transmitting a specific number of photons can be tailored by controlling @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> given the above - mentioned properties , this device can be used as a single photon transistor@xcite where the presence of a gate field could control the transmission of a signal field . </S>",
    "<S> one scheme to implement the transistor is to tune the frequency of the gate field resonant with one of the polaritons in the first - order manifold , say @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> a photon injected at @xmath67 , increases the probability of absorbing photons that are resonant with the @xmath11 transition at @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> if the signal is tuned to this frequency , the presence of the gate field enhances the transmission of the signal field . </S>",
    "<S> the photonic crystal architecture allows for easy integration of such a single photon transistor with photonic crystal waveguides@xcite so the single photon switching is done directly on the chip . the most straightforward configuration would be a photonic crystal cavity butt - coupled in between two photonic crystal waveguides@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion we observed the phenomena of photon blockade and photon - induced tunneling in a solid - state strongly coupled qd / cavity system . by changing the frequency of the input beam , we synthesized nonclassical states of light with various degrees of bunching or antibunching ( @xmath69 ) . these results complement the photon blockade experiments in atomic physics by showing the full dependence of @xmath21 on the probe frequency . </S>",
    "<S> they have promise in realizing single photon transistors for on - chip optical logic devices operating at the single photon level , or the implementation of two - qubit gates and generation of nonclassical states for quantum information processing , quantum lithography and quantum metrology . </S>"
