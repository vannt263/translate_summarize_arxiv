    "the phenomenon of mode - locking is a general feature of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "it consists of the resonant response to an external periodic force that occurs when a characteristic frequency of the driven system matches or _ locks onto _ the driving frequency . in the mode - locked region",
    "the system traces periodic orbits in phase space . outside the region of mode locking , the system may follow quasiperiodic orbits or march towards the onset of chaos .    examples of systems that exhibit mode - locking abound in nature . in 1665",
    ", huygens discovered the spontaneous synchronization of swinging pendulum clocks in close proximity to one another . on the celestial scale , the moon s period of rotation locks onto its period of revolution about earth in a 1:1-ratio , so it always presents the same face to earth .",
    "the rotation of mercury is also locked onto the sun such that there are three rotations for every two orbits , constituting a 3:2-mode locking .",
    "mode - locking to external periodic stumuli is a common feature in biology .",
    "examples include the cell cycle in budding yeast  @xcite , the swimming and heartbeat networks of medicinal leeches  @xcite , and the rhythmic behavior produced by neuronal networks  @xcite .",
    "mode - locking is also relevant in such diverse phenomena as vortex shedding  @xcite , singing sand dunes  @xcite , and multimode lasers  @xcite . in condensed - matter physics , josephson junction arrays  @xcite ,",
    "driven superconducting vortices  @xcite , and charged - density waves ( cdw )  @xcite provide convenient settings for studying mode - locking .",
    "mathematicians have long used the language of @xmath0 to describe the trajectories followed by dynamical systems in phase space and thus infer their physical properties .",
    "in particular , circle maps  @xcite , along with the mathematical tools of bifurcation theory and return map , lay the foundation for much of the theoretical modeling and analysis of mode - locking phenomena .",
    "conceptually , the simplest evolution equation that yields mode - locking consists of a single overdamped degree - of - freedom ( dof ) @xmath1 in a periodic _ pinning _ potential @xmath2 of stength @xmath3 , driven by an external periodic force of frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics is described by the equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the pinning force .",
    "mode - locking occurs when the time - averaged velocity locks on to a rational multiple of the external driving frequency , @xmath7 for a region of nonzero area in the @xmath8-space .",
    "the regions of the @xmath8 parameter space where mode - locking occurs are known as arnold tongues  @xcite .",
    "the time - averaged velocity exhibits a devils - staircase ( ds ) behavior : there exists a mode - locked plateau corresponding to each rational @xmath9 .",
    "while there have been much work on the fractal dimensionality of the set of gaps between the mode - locked steps in the staircase  @xcite , the calculation of the width of the mode - locked steps has mainly relied on an argument put forward by shapiro for a single - particle model of cdws  @xcite . in this case",
    "the dof @xmath1 is the phase of the cdw , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes of the dc and the ac driving electric fields , respectively .",
    "the time - averaged velocity corresponds to the drift velocity @xmath12 of the cdw , which in turn determines the cdw current .",
    "most available results on mode locking have been obtained numerically .",
    "one of the rare analytical results is for a single dof in a cosine pinning potential , @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the arnold tongues are symmetric with respect to the mirror axis centered at the apex of the tongue and pinch to zero width for all parameters in its phase space , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] . on the other hand",
    ", numerics have shown that in extended systems consisting of many coupled dofs the arnold tongues are generally asymmetric and never pinch to zero width . in this work ,",
    "we reexamine single dof model for various pinning potentials and show that the cosine pinning is special . for a generic pining potential",
    "the tongues are asymmetric and do not pinch to zero as soon as the pinning potential contains any higher harmonics .",
    "this more complex shape of the arnold tongues may be the result of the collective behavior of many coupled degrees of freedom , but it arises even for a single particle , provided the pinning potential differs from a simple cosine .",
    "of course in an extended system collective effects renormalize the pinning potential , so that even a bare cosine pinning yields asymmetric arnold tongues .",
    "we show below that for generic pinning potential the shapiro s method always fails at small @xmath11 , where the asymmetry of the arnold tongue is most apparent . for the specific case of scalloped potential",
    ", we develop an exact analytical mehtod for the calculation of the mode - locking behavior of one dof for @xmath11 small enough that the single dof does not hop from one scallop to the next .",
    "this is precisely the regime where the shapiro s argument always fails .",
    "our analytical solution fro small @xmath11 also provides dynamical constraints that are both necessary and sufficient for the full determination of the mode - locked step widths .",
    "this work serves as a starting point in our effort to construct a mean - field theory for the general phenomenon of mode - locking in extended media that is amenable to analytical analysis in useful limits . to do so",
    ", we must first test analytical approximations at the single - particle level and identify a simple , yet generic , pinning potential as our prototypical starting model . to achieve these two first - step goals",
    ", we study in detail the case of 1:1-mode locking and consider two specific periodic pinning potential @xmath14 $ ] , a scalloped parabolic and an impure cosine potential . in section ii we review shapiro s method for calculating the width of the mode - locked steps .",
    "we then consider the one - particle mode - locking dynamics in the scalloped parabolic pinning potential in section iii .",
    "this form of potential has the advantage of permitting exact analytical solution in the no - hopping regime . in section iv",
    ", we repeat our analysis for the impure cosine pinning potential .",
    "section v concludes our paper .",
    "adapting an argument proposed by shapiro  @xcite , thorne _ et .",
    "al . _ computed the width of the harmonic and subharmonic mode - locked steps for the one - dof model of cdw given in eq .",
    "( [ eom ] )  @xcite .",
    "while their calculation explains the occurrence of mode - locking in terms of the lowering of the pinning energy , their results do not agree with numerical results for the shape of the arnold tongues in the regime of low ac - driving amplitude or high ac - driving frequency .",
    "this regime corresponds to the case where the particle dynamics is confined to one period of the pinning potential . to show how shapiro s method fails in this regime , we first review the calculation of thorne et al .  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to first consider the single dof model of eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) for a cosine pinning potential .",
    "we note that in the absence of pinning the equation of motion has the exact solution @xmath15 , with @xmath16 a constant , which gives the trivial result @xmath17 . in the presence of pinning we",

    "the particle moves rapidly over the pinning potential and the temporal variations due to pinning are small .",
    "following ref .",
    "we then look for a solution where @xmath20 , independent of time .",
    "we expect this approximation will apply for large @xmath11 and weak pinning .",

    "the region of parameters where the system is mode - locked coincides with the region where the energy of the mode - locked state is lower than that of the unlocked state .",
    "this is not , however , the case for arbitrary pinning potential , as we will see below . in general the condition that energy of the mode - locked state be lower than that of the unlocked state is necessary for their stability of the mode - locked state , but not sufficient ( see fig .",

    "thorne and collaborators adapted this argument to an arbitrary periodic pinning potential that can be expressed as a fourier sum : @xmath32 proceeding as in the single cosine case , using again the bessel summation formula and averaging over a cycle , we find that @xmath12 is determined by eq .",

( [ arnold ] ) suggests that the width of the shapiro steps oscillates with @xmath11 , which has indeed been observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "these authors further assumed that the range of parameters where the system is mode - locked coincides with those where the mean pinning energy in the mode locked state is lower than its value @xmath35 in the unlocked state , i.e. , @xmath36 the mean pinning force given by eq .",

    "thorne et al .",
    "use the condition @xmath40 to determine the arnold tongues .",
    "the latter holds for a range @xmath41 . for pure cosine pinning @xmath42 . for arbitrary pinning potentials @xmath43 , resulting in an overestimate of the mode - locked regions .",
    "regardless of the condition used for mode - locking , a consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ arnold ] ) and ( [ thorne ] ) is that each arnold tongue is symmetric about a central axis for any periodic pinning potential . in the case of 1:1-mode locking",

    "we first consider the case of scalloped parabolic pinning , whose potential can be expressed either in terms of the floor function , @xmath48 , defined as the largest integer less than or equal to its argument @xmath49 , or as a fourier series : @xmath50 a plot of the scalloped parabolic potential is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this case",
    "the double sum in the expression for the time - averaged pinning force , eq .",

    "[ fig1 ] the pinning force is piece - wise linear and the dynamics of the driven particle can be solved exactly within each period of the pinning potential .",

    "clearly the analytical solution yields the exact value of @xmath10 for the onset of mode - locking at @xmath62 and also does an excellent job of fitting the exact arnold tongues for small @xmath11 , where the driven particle remains within a single scallop .    ]    in contrast , shapiro s argument fails most severely precisely in this region of small @xmath11 , as apparent from fig .",
    "[ scap ] where the arnold tongues obtained for the 1:1 mode - locked step by the shapiro argument ( triangles ) are compared to the exact solution ( diamonds ) . as mentioned in section ii ,",
    "shapiro s method predicts symmetrical oscillation about the axis @xmath44 .",
    "however , exact numerical solution reveals that the 1:1-mode locked step , in fact , originates from @xmath63 .",
    "this difference arises because the shapiro method is essentially a perturbation theory about the high velocity state and becomes exact at large drives and very weak disorder . on the other hand for fixed driving frequency @xmath4 and small ac - drive amplitude @xmath11 , or",
    "conversely fixed @xmath11 and high frequency the driving force has only a weak effect and pinning dominates . in this region the time - averaged velocity is well approximated by the instantaneous velocity .",
    "this fact underlies our approximation scheme in which we solve exactly for the instantaneous dynamical solution for the cdw phase @xmath64 , assuming that the particle does not hop over any one scallop in the periodic pinning potential .",
    "neglecting the effect of scallop - hopping simplifies the dynamics considerably , as the elimination of the associated nonlinearity permits analytically tractable solutions .",
    "this method is complementary to the one developed by shapiro .",
    "our method can be readily generalized to other harmonic and subharmonic mode - locking steps that involve no hopping between scallops and thus satisfy the constraint @xmath54 .",
    "for a cosine pinning potential the width of mode - locked steps pinches to zero periodically at finite values of the ac - driving amplitude , @xmath11 .",
    "this is well explained by shapiro s argument  @xcite based on its expression of the time - averaged pinning potential : since the time - averaged pinning force has only one term for any particular values of @xmath23 and @xmath65 and it is a consequence of the fact that pinning potential contains only a single harmonic in its fourier series . to see this point explicitly , we compare the two cases of a pure cosine pinning potential function and of an _ impure _ cosine , consisting of a sum of two different harmonics : @xmath66        again we are focusing on 1:1-mode locked steps . for the impure cosine pinning , the time - averaged pinning force is @xmath67 it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ impure ] that the addition of a small harmonic is sufficient to give a finite width to the tongues for all nonzero values of @xmath11 .",
    "again shapiro s method clearly fails at small @xmath11 . to analyze the dynamics in this region",
    ", we assume that there is no particle - hopping and use the analytical method discussed in the previous section . to do this",
    "we fit the impure cosine pinning potential to a parabola over one cycle . using mathematica , we find that the fitted pinning potential yields @xmath68 , or equivalently , a scalloped parabolic pinning potential with a pinning strength of @xmath69 over the same cycle . the resulting comparison plot of the numerically obtained arnold tongue for 1:1-mode locking and the  v \"- shaped asymptotes obtained analytically in the no - hopping approximation is shown in fig .",
    "( [ impurearnold ] ) .",
    "again , there is remarkable agreement between our analytical approximation and the exact numerical solution in the small - drive regime .        to further clarify the role of the no - hopping approximation used in our analytical calculation",
    ", we note that in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ dis ] ) , we implicitly assume that @xmath70 , for @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "self - consistency of our solution is then imposed by looking for the set of points in the region defined by eq .",

    "[ gr5 ] , the region of @xmath39 , bounded by black circles , which explicitly satisfies the constraint @xmath70 is an excellent approximation to the lopsided pear - shaped region of the arnold - tongue for @xmath72 . beyond this region ,",
    "the particle presumably hops over more than one scallop per drive period , and our analytical approximation would no longer apply .     which are explicitly checked to satisfy the constraint of @xmath70 . ]",
    "in summary , we have developed a simple analytical method to obtain the shape of the arnold tongues in the regime of small ac - driving amplitude @xmath11 or high - driving frequency , where the driven particle does not hop between different periods of the driving potential within one period of the drive .",
    "this method is complementary to the perturbative one based on shapiro s argument  @xcite that applies in the large @xmath11 or low frequency regime .",
    "the method is exact for a scalloped pinning potential and is easily adapted to other pinning potentials by a simple fit .",
    "our method is easily adapted to the analysis of @xmath9 mode - locking steps for arbitrary @xmath65 and @xmath54 .    as mentioned in the introduction , the motivation of this work was to develop simple methods for the analysis of mode - locking steps that will serve as the starting point for the development of a mean - field theory of mode - locking in systems composed of many interacting many degrees - of - freedom .",
    "we hope to do this by combining the no - hopping approximation for the analysis of the low drive regime with the shapiro argument for the study of the high - drive region . finally ,",
    "while the phenomenon of mode - locking is pervasive in dynamical systems , each subfield has developed its own set of theoretical tools , often inspired and required by real - world applications . despite past attempts  @xcite , a consensus is still lacking in regard to a unifying formalism in the description of mode - locking .",
    "it is our further hope that our results would illuminate aspects of mode - locking , which are still not well understood and which would merit further study .",
