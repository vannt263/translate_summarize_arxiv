    "since the seminal paper on synthesis of elements in stars @xcite , our understanding of the nucleosynthesis process have greatly improved ( for recent papers see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath1- and @xmath5-processes are the mastermind responsible for nucleosynthesis of heavy elements .",
    "the @xmath1-process mechanism basically requires the understanding of nuclear characteristics of hundreds of neutron - rich nuclide , mostly unknown .",
    "the weak interaction rates and reaction cross sections are amongst the key nuclear input data to affect the @xmath1-process calculation .",
    "the @xmath0-decay rates deserve a special mention as they are responsible for changing the nuclear specie during heavy element synthesis . at the same time @xmath1-process mechanism",
    "also demands accurate estimate of other physical parameters including entropy , temperature , density and lepton - to - baryon ratio of the stellar matter .",
    "the physical conditions conducive for occurrence of @xmath1-process are relatively high temperatures ( of the order of few gk ) and high neutron densities ( @xmath6 10@xmath7 @xmath8 ) @xcite . under prevailing conditions the capturing process of neutrons takes place at a faster pace than the competing @xmath0-decay processes and many neutron - rich nuclei ( with @xmath9 mev )",
    "are produced .",
    "nuclei possessing closed neutron shells of 50 , 82 and 126 exhibit discontinuities in neutron separation energies because of stronger binding energy .",
    "consequently the @xmath1-process matter flow decelerates and wait for occurrence of several @xmath0-decays to occur before the process of rapid neutron capture resumes .",
    "peaks have been observed in the distribution abundances of @xmath1- mechanism at @xmath2 = 50 , 82 and 126 because of accumulation of matter at these waiting point nuclei .",
    "the calculated half - lives of @xmath0-decay for waiting point nuclei describes the time scale it takes the mass flow to transpose seed nuclei to larger nuclei in the third peak at around @xmath10 200 .",
    "provided that the @xmath1- mechanism has enough duration time for @xmath0-flow equilibrium to built , the @xmath0-decay half - lives are proportional to the relative elemental abundances @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the experimental information for waiting point nuclei is scarce . for the neutron",
    "closed shells of @xmath2 = 50 and 82 waiting point nuclei , the available half - lives are rather limited and insufficient @xcite .",
    "the scenario is expected to improve in near future with radioactive ion beam experiments at riken @xcite and gsi @xcite .",
    "hence for @xmath1-process simulations the required @xmath0-decay half - lives come primarily from theoretical estimations . an extensive tabulation of microscopic @xmath0-decay rates for a wide range of nuclei was reported by klapdor - kleingrothaus et al .",
    "later , staudt et al . @xcite and hirsh et al .",
    "@xcite , used the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) model , for the first time , to predict @xmath0-decay half - lives for a wide range of proton - rich and neutron - rich exotic nuclei .",
    "the @xmath1-process spectra of waiting point nuclei can be affected by the presence of low lying energy levels possessing different parities .",
    "this necessitates the incorporation of the first - forbidden ( ff ) chapter to the @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "the pn - qrpa model was used to estimate the ff contributions for a handful of nuclei for the first time by homma et al .",
    "later other models were used to estimate the ff contribution .",
    "these include , but are not limited to , the qrpa + gross theory @xcite , self - consistent density - functional + continuum qrpa @xcite and more recently the large - scale shell model calculation @xcite .",
    "only a small percent of the total @xmath11 sum rule lie within the @xmath12 window for the neutron - rich nuclei participating in the @xmath1-process .",
    "the rest of the strength resides in the gamow - teller ( gt ) giant resonance located at much larger excitation energies .",
    "this may furnish explanation as to why different model calculations of @xmath0-decay half - lives may differ significantly without violating the sum rule .",
    "taking the weak - interaction rates to stellar domain is a next level calculation .",
    "nabi and klapdor - kleingrothaus used the pn - qrpa approach and calculated stellar weak rates of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15-shell nuclei @xcite for various astrophysical applications .",
    "the current pn - qrpa approach , using a separable interaction with a multi-@xmath16 space , makes possible a state - by - state calculation of weak interaction rates summing over boltzmann - weighted , microscopically estimated gt strengths for all parent excited levels .",
    "this distinguishing feature of current calculation makes it unique amongst all calculations of stellar weak rates ( including those using the independent particle model and shell model ) .    in the present work we report the gt strength distribution calculation , half - life calculation , stellar @xmath0-decay and positron emission rate calculations , energy rates of @xmath0-delayed neutron and corresponding neutron emission probabilities ( @xmath17 ) for nuclei having neutron magic numbers ( @xmath2 = 50 and 82 ) using the pn - qrpa model .",
    "ten waiting point nuclei ( six having @xmath2= 50 and four having @xmath2 = 82 ) were selected for this paper . in all cases",
    "we consider both the allowed gt and unique first - forbidden ( u1f ) transition contribution to the total weak rates .",
    "non - unique transitions are also important .",
    "currently we are working on codes to calculate non - unique contributions and their inclusion would be taken as a future assignment .",
    "we organize our paper in four sections .",
    "section  2 describes the necessary pn - qrpa formalism . in section  3",
    ", we show our results and present comparison with measurement and previous calculations .",
    "conclusions and our key findings are drawn in section  4 .",
    "the addition of all transition probabilities to levels in the daughter state @xmath18 with energies @xmath19 lying within the @xmath12 window gives the terrestrial half - life of @xmath0-decay .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 shows the partial half - life for the allowed @xmath0-decay transition given by @xmath22 here ( @xmath23/@xmath24 ) is axial to vector coupling constant ratio , ( numerical value is -1.254 ) , @xmath25 is a physical constant given by @xmath25=@xmath26 ( numerical value is 6295 s ) and @xmath27 is the fermi integral function ( taking into account finite size effects and screening of nucleus , using the recipe of gove and martin @xcite ) .",

    "for the case of @xmath98rh , once again the u1f contribution is very significant but from table  [ tab1 ] the half - life is reduced only by 32@xmath3 .",
    "the reason for this is traced back to phase space calculation where it is seen from fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] that at t@xmath99 = 0.01 ( at this low temperature , stellar phase space would very much mimic the terrestrial phase space ) the u1f phase space is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the allowed phase space .",

    "our calculation fulfilled the model - independent ikeda sum rule , except for a couple of odd - a cases .",
    "the pn - qrpa calculated half - lives , after incorporation of u1f transitions , were in decent agrement with the measured half - lives and at the same time were also suggestive of incorporation of non - unique forbidden contributions which we plan to take as a future assignment .",
    "it is hoped that the present study would prove useful for a better and reliable simulation of nucleosynthesis calculation .",
    "we found substantial u1f contribution to the @xmath0-decay half - lives for the @xmath2 = 82 waiting points . except for @xmath98rh ,",
