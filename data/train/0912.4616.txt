    "this degree of connection between the tev blazars and the gev regime was not found by egret and the previous generation of tev instruments , and is evident now only as a result of the improved sensitivity and greater overlap between the effective energy ranges of _ fermi _ and the current generation of tev instruments .        the majority of the tev blazars detected by _",

    "the intrinsic spectrum for some of the tev sources can be well described by a single power - law across the energy range spanned by the _ fermi _ lat and the tev observatories , with any breaks in the measured gamma - ray spectra between the two regimes being consistent with the effects of absorption with a model of minimal ebl density .",
