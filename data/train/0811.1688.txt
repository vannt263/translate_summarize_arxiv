    "high resolution visible and near - infrared observations by the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics show nuclear spirals in the centers of active galaxies @xcite , as well as in those of normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "nuclear spirals have a variety of morphologies such as grand - design spirals , one - armed spirals , and flocculent spirals @xcite .",
    "the grand - design nuclear spirals are symmetric two - armed spirals , while the flocculent , or `` chaotic , '' nuclear spirals have multiple arms that are likely to be segmented into smaller arms .",
    "the morphology of symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals depends on the gas sound speed and the shape of the gravitational potential in the nuclear regions of galaxies @xcite . a number of hydrodynamic simulations @xcite have already been performed to understand the effect of the gas sound speed on the gas flows inside the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) .",
    "the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of @xcite and @xcite showed that the off - axis shocks form at low gas sound speed , while the on - axis shocks develop at high gas sound speed .",
    "however , they were unable to analyze the nuclear morphology in detail due to the lack of resolution of their simulations .",
    "on the other hand , the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals generated by the gravitational torque of the bar were found in the high - resolution hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it was shown by @xcite with grid - based hydrodynamic simulations that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spiral can be explained in terms the gas density waves , since the spiral arms open out as the gas sound speed increases .",
    "a similar effect of the gas sound speed on the openness of symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals was also found in the sph simulations of @xcite .",
    "however , their simulations suggested that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals are formed by hydrodynamic spiral shocks driven by the bar .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the gas sound speed plays a crucial role in the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies .",
    "their grid - based hydrodynamic simulations showed that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals are formed by hydrodynamic shocks driven by the bar when the gas sound speed is high ( @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) , while for gas at a low sound speed ( @xmath10 km s@xmath9 ) , they are maintained by gas density waves .",
    "it was noticed in the grid - based hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite that like the gas sound speed , the bar strength can also affect the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies .",
    "since the central mass concentration determines the shape of the gravitational potential in the nuclear regions of galaxies , it can also affect the morphology of symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals .",
    "this can be understood from the simulations of @xcite and @xcite , where they have mentioned that the openness of symmetric two - armed nuclear spiral arms depends on the central mass concentration .",
    "our previous simulations @xcite showed that the presence of a central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , which can greatly affect the central mass concentration , plays a significant role in the sense that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals form when the mass of an smbh is massive enough to remove the inner inner lindblad resonance ( iilr ) .",
    "in addition to this , @xcite noticed that a central massive black hole ( mbh ) of sufficient mass can allow the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals to extend all the way to its immediate vicinity .",
    "however , it is important to note here that the effect of the central mass concentration on the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spiral was not known from previous studies , whereas that of the gas sound speed was understood from the simulations of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning that if we consider the model galaxy whose bulge central density varies as @xmath1 , its mass would be more centrally concentrated as the cusp parameter @xmath0 increases .",
    "thus , the purpose of the present paper is to examine the effect of the central mass concentration by varying the cusp parameter @xmath0 on the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies . for this purpose",
    ", we employ the sph technique to solve the hydrodynamic equations for the gas flow in the model galaxies whose bulge central densities vary as @xmath1 .",
    "we have also included the self - gravity of the gas in our calculations , since this can play a significant role in high - density regions such as shocks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the model galaxy , model parameters , the gaseous disk model , and the numerical method . in ",
    "3 we present the results of our simulations , and the discussion of our results is given in ",
    "the conclusions are presented in   5 .",
    "the model galaxy is assumed to be composed of four components : halo , disk , bulge , and bar .",
    "the properties ( density , size and structure ) of all these potential generating components are assumed to be invariant in time in the frame corotating with the bar .",
    "the halo component , which gives rise to the flat rotation curve at outer radii , is assumed to have a logarithmic potential with finite core radius , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the halo core radius and @xmath13 is the constant rotation velocity at large @xmath14 .",
    "the disk component is assumed to have the potential of @xcite exponential disk , @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the disk scale length , @xmath17 is the central surface density , and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are the modified bessel functions .",
    "the total disk mass is simply @xmath20 .    for the bulge component",
    ", we adopt the potential of the spherical @xmath0-models of @xcite , @xmath21 , \\textrm{for $ \\gamma \\ne 2$},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the total mass of the bulge , @xmath23 is the scale - length , and @xmath0 is the cusp parameter that can have a value in between @xmath24 .",
    "its corresponding density varies as @xmath1 near the center and @xmath2 at large radii , and hence possesses a central density core for @xmath3 and cusps for @xmath4 .",
    "this bulge with @xmath25 most closely resembles the de vaucouleurs @xmath26-profile @xcite that is known to better represent the bulges of real galaxies .",
    "hereafter , the central mass concentration will be represented by @xmath0 , since the central mass concentration of the model galaxies increases with the cusp parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the bar is a triaxial component in three dimensions .",
    "however , our simulation is restricted to the two - dimensional disk .",
    "thus , we assume the following form of the gravitational potential proposed by @xcite for the bar component : @xmath27 where @xmath28}$ ] , and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the needle length and softening length , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 defines the elongation of the bar , which is proportional to the axis ratio @xmath32 of the flattened homogeneous ellipsoid bar of @xcite when @xmath33 ( see fig . 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the major and minor axes of a flattened homogeneous ellipsoid bar .",
    "table 1 + 0.2 cm model parameters 0.2 cm    [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     we have considered ten models m1-m10 , which are listed in table @xmath36 .",
    "all these models are defined according to different choices of the gas sound speed @xmath37 and the central mass concentration @xmath0 . in this paper , we are mainly interested to examine the effect of the central mass concentration @xmath0 on the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies when the gas sound speed is chosen to be @xmath38 10 km s@xmath9 ( see   3.2 and ",
    "thus , apart from the models with @xmath39 , @xmath5 , and @xmath36 , an additional model with @xmath40 is considered for the gas sound speed of @xmath38 10 km s@xmath9 ( i.e. , model m4 ) .",
    "however , the models with @xmath39 , @xmath5 , and @xmath36 are chosen for each of the remaining gas sound speeds of @xmath41 and @xmath42 km s@xmath9 .",
    "since the total visible mass of the model galaxies is assumed to be @xmath43 , the masses of the gas , disk , bulge , and bar components in units of @xmath44 are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "thus , the mass distributions of the model galaxies are chosen to be similar to those of early - type barred galaxies ( @xmath49sba ) , since the disk - to - bulge mass ratio and the fractional mass of the bar are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "the scale lengths of the halo , disk , and bulge are assumed to be @xmath52 kpc , @xmath53 kpc , and @xmath54 kpc , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the bar needle length @xmath29 , the bar softening length @xmath30 , the bar pattern speed @xmath55 , and the rotation velocity of the halo @xmath56 are fixed at @xmath57 kpc , @xmath58 kpc , @xmath59 km s@xmath9 kpc@xmath9 , and @xmath60 km s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "figure @xmath36 shows the rotation curves and angular frequency curves of the models mentioned in table @xmath36 that have the central mass concentrations of @xmath39 and @xmath36 .",
    "since the models with constant values of @xmath0 have the same mass distribution , we present the rotational curves and angular frequency curves of models m1 and m3 that assume @xmath39 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the top left panel of figure @xmath36 represents the rotational velocities of the halo , disk , bulge , and bar components of model m1 with @xmath3 as a function of radius , while the top right panel shows the rotational curves of model m3 with @xmath61 .",
    "since the bar is nonaxisymmetric component , its contribution to the rotational velocity is included here after averaging it axisymmetrically @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in the top panels of figure @xmath36 , the rotational velocities in the vicinity of the galactic center are affected by the increase in central mass concentration from @xmath62 to @xmath36 .",
    "however , the bottom panels of figure @xmath36 represent the angular frequencies corresponding to the rotational velocity generated by the axisymmetric components as a function of radius .",
    "the adaption of @xmath55 = @xmath59 km s@xmath9 kpc@xmath9 places the iilr at the negligible distance from the galactic center , and the outer inner lindblad resonance ( oilr ) near @xmath63 kpc in model m1 with @xmath3 , whereas it places the single ilr close to @xmath7 kpc in model m3 with @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , the corotation radius ( @xmath64 ) is found to be around @xmath65 in models m1 and m3 for the above choice of @xmath55 .",
    "since the angular frequency curve reaches high values ( larger than @xmath55 ) at the nucleus for model m1 that considers the central mass concentration of @xmath3 , it suggests that for the assumed values of @xmath47 and @xmath54 kpc , the mass of model m1 with @xmath3 is sufficiently centrally concentrated @xcite to weaken the iilr by placing its location at the negligible distance from the galactic center .",
    "however , the iilr is completely removed and the angular frequency curve goes to infinity at the galactic center for model m3 with @xmath61 , since the central mass concentration increases from @xmath39 to @xmath36 .",
    "although it is not presented here , we would like to mention that except for the slight difference in the very vicinity of galactic center , the rotation curves of the models with the remaining values of @xmath0 = @xmath5 and @xmath7 appear to be similar to those of model m3 with @xmath61 .",
    "in addition to this , the angular frequency curves of the models with @xmath0 = @xmath5 and @xmath7 do not greatly differ from those of model m3 with @xmath61 , except for the minor shift in the location of the single ilr .      in the direction of modeling the response of the gaseous disk to the imposition of nonaxisymmetric bar potentials ,",

    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite pointed out that this approach of considering isothermal gas is consistent with the ism model of @xcite , who argued that the cloud fluid can be treated like an isothermal gas if the clouds have an equilibrium mass spectrum .",
    "the equilibrium is assumed to be maintained by a steady supply of small clouds by supernovae .",
    "thus , we assume the infinitesimally thin and isothermal uniform gaseous disks with the effective sound speeds of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath42 km s@xmath9 .",
    "the mass of the gaseous disk was chosen to be @xmath68 of the total visible mass of the model galaxy , since we simulate the response of the central kiloparsec region of the gaseous disk in early - type barred galaxies . in order to represent the initial gaseous disk with constant density ,",
    "@xmath69 sph particles are distributed uniformly over a grid inside a circular disk of @xmath70 kpc radius .",
    "the initial circular velocities are given to the sph particles so that the centrifugal accelerations of the particles are balanced with their gravitational accelerations . in the context of this equilibrium gaseous disk model , the pressure gradient forces are zero .",
    "the initial resolution length , defined by equation ( 12 ) , was found to be @xmath71 pc .",
    "however , the resolution of the sph simulations becomes far better than the initial values in the central region as the density in the nuclear region increases within a few bar rotation periods ( see   2.4 ) .",
    "we introduce the bar potential slowly within one - half bar rotation period to avoid a spurious response of the gaseous disk , where the bar rotation period @xmath72 is @xmath73 yr . the previous simulations of the isothermal gas flow in barred galaxies with broad spectrum of values for effective sound speed @xcite and the compilation of hi velocity dispersion by @xcite suggest that our adopted values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath42 km s@xmath9 correspond to the vertical cloud velocity dispersion in the galactic bulge .",
    "we have used the pmsph method to solve the hydrodynamical equations for the gas flow in barred galaxies .",
    "our simulations are confined in two dimensions , since restricting the calculation to two dimensions increases greatly the resolution , which is important in the present problem of resolving the shocks ( cf .",
    "* ) . in this regard",
    ", @xcite mentioned that the two - dimensional description appears to be a reasonable approximation , since they have done some three - dimensional simulations , where the gas flows were indeed similar to the two - dimensional ones .",
    "we have used the pmsph code of @xcite , which has recently been used by @xcite to model the gas flow in the barred galaxy ngc 4123 .",
    "r. fux of geneva observatory group has kindly provided the pmsph code to us . here",
    "we briefly describe the necessary specifications relevant to the particular aspects of our pmsph code and refer the readers to @xcite for a detailed description of our code and to @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for the general properties of solving euler s equation of motion using the popular lagrangian method .",
    "since sph is fully lagrangian , it does not have any grid to impose any artificial restrictions on the global geometry of the systems under study or any mesh - related limitations on the dynamic range in spatial resolution . thus",
    ", a high numerical resolution is naturally achieved in high - density regions such as shocks by using sph @xcite , which is necessary to solve our present problem of understanding the response of gaseous disks in the nuclear regions of barred galaxies .    using the sph method , we solve the euler equation of motion that can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the velocity field and @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the density , pressure , and artificial viscosity of the gas , respectively .",
    "@xmath79 is the gravitational force , where @xmath80 includes potentials of the gas , as well as the stellar and dark components .    in sph",
    ", the density is evaluated directly at each particle position @xmath81 in space by summing the contributions from the density profiles of neighboring particles and is represented by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of gas particles , @xmath84 is the mass of individual particles , @xmath85 is the kernel function , and @xmath86 is the smoothing length that defines the local spatial resolution and is proportional to the local mean interparticle spacing . in our code , the adopted sph kernel is a spherically symmetric spline that vanishes outside @xmath87 because of its finite spatial extension .",
    "our code assumes an isothermal equation of state , i.e. , @xmath88 where @xmath37 is the effective sound speed , which can be interpreted globally as the velocity dispersion of the interstellar clouds .",
    "the internal energy of the gas is at any time and everywhere constant , and in particular , there is no energy equation involved in our code . with the above equation ( 7 ) ,",
    "the pressure gradient term of @xcite in the euler s equation simply takes the form @xmath89    the introduction of an artificial viscosity is required for an accurate treatment of the flow near shocks . in our code , the artificial viscosity is calculated exactly as in @xcite .",
    "it consists of the bulk and the von neumann - richtmyer viscosities , with the standard parameters set to @xmath90 and @xmath91 , and takes into account @xcite correction to avoid energy dissipation in pure shearing flows .    in order to achieve high resolution ,",
    "it is necessary to treat the smoothing length @xmath86 properly , since it determines the local spatial resolution . to increase the resolution in high - density regions like shocks , our code uses a spatially variable smoothing length @xmath86 to assign an individual smoothing length @xmath92 to each particle in such a manner that the number of neighbor particles @xmath93 to each particle always remains as close as possible to a fixed number @xmath94",
    "this allows us to save significant computing time while keeping spatial resolutions high enough to resolve the shocks @xcite .",
    "two particles @xmath95 and @xmath96 are defined as mutual neighbors if @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the symmetrized smoothing length , which is supplied in equations @xmath100 and @xmath101 , as well as in the formula for the artificial viscosity to ensure momentum conservation .    at each time step , the smoothing lengths are updated in our code according to the general three - dimensional scaling law : @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are constants , @xmath93 is the number of neighbors of particle @xmath95 , and @xmath105 is added to take into account particle @xmath95 . following @xcite , we take the time derivative of equation @xmath106 and substitute the continuity equation to yield @xmath107 in equation @xmath108 , @xcite did not include the term @xmath109 to ensure a constant number of neighbors .",
    "however , this does not prevent a slow numerical departure of the @xmath93 s from @xmath94 with time . to overcome this problem ,",
    "our code simply damps such departures by setting @xmath110 in equation @xmath108 and integrates the resulting equation along with the equations of motion .",
    "the parameter @xmath111 controls the damping rate per time step @xmath112 and should be significantly greater than @xmath36 to avoid abrupt discontinuities in nongravitational forces . in all our simulations , we have assumed @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the initial smoothing lengths of the gas particles , confined near the plane @xmath115 , are defined as @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the mass of each gas particle and the surface density of the initial gaseous disk of radius @xmath119 kpc , respectively .",
    "it is customary to impose quite a large lower limit on the minimum smoothing length @xmath120 to save computing time .",
    "however , because of the fast neighbor searching algorithm adopted in our code , we have used @xmath120 = 0.1 pc to resolve structures down to the parsec scale . although the initial smoothing length ( i.e. , the initial resolution length ) of @xmath121 pc is employed in our simulations ( see   2.3 ) , the smallest smoothing length actually achieved after a few bar rotation periods is @xmath122 pc , which is smaller than the @xmath123 pc used in the high - resolution sph simulations of @xcite .",
    "we find that the smoothing length of @xmath122 pc is small enough to resolve the nuclear spirals , as shown in   3 .",
    "furthermore , it is worth mentioning here that our code uses a synchronized version of the standard leap - frog time integrator ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is known to well conserve the total energy and the total angular momentum and also employs an adaptive time step to temporally resolve the high - density shocks in the gaseous disk ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our gaseous disk is not a self - gravitating one , since its mass is assumed to be only a tiny fraction of the model galaxy ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "this suggests that toomre s @xmath125 value is much greater than unity ( i.e. , @xmath126 ) , which represents a stable gaseous disk ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we have included the self - gravity of gas in our calculations because it can play a significant role in high - density regions such as shocks that develop in the later evolution of gaseous disk . to compute to the self - gravity of gas , our code uses the particle - mesh ( pm ) technique with polar - cylindrical grid geometry described in @xcite .",
    "the advantage of considering the polar - cylindrical grid is that the radial and azimuthal resolutions increase toward the center , where a variety of features are likely to develop because of the gas inflow driven by the bar . using the convolution theorem ,",
    "the potential is computed on the polar - cylindrical grid by the fast fourier transform ( fft ) technique in the @xmath127 and @xmath128 dimensions , where the cells are equally spaced .",
    "the radial spacing of the cells is logarithmic with a linear core to avoid an accumulation point at the center . since the keplerian kernel",
    "does not truly satisfy the conditions of the convolution theorem , a variable homogeneous ellipsoidal kernel is adopted in our code for the softening of the short range forces ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this kernel tends toward the keplerian kernel at large distance , and can also be useful in situations that need anisotropic resolution @xcite .",
    "since the polar - cylindrical grid is non - homogeneous , a variable softening length is necessary .",
    "otherwise a softening length intermediate between the smallest and largest cell sizes both decreases resolution in some parts of the grid and enhances grid noise in other parts of the grid .",
    "thus , the softening lengths represented by the semi - axes of our adopted variable homogeneous ellipsoidal kernel have been set as @xmath129 times the respective cell dimensions .",
    "this ensures the conservation of the total energy , as well as of the total angular momentum while keeping high central resolution @xcite . for a more detailed description of the pm technique used in our code ,",
    "we simply refer the readers to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nuclear features of the gaseous disks in models m1-m10 at the evolution time of @xmath130 are shown in figure @xmath131 . here",
    "our results are shown on the frame corotating with the bar , which always lies horizontally . as can be seen in figure @xmath131",

    "it is also apparent that the nuclear disks are completely filled with the gas particles for models m8-m10 in the last column that assume the gas sound speed of @xmath8 km s@xmath9 . in this case",
    ", the innermost parts of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spiral of model m8 with @xmath39 extend all the way to the center with winding angle of @xmath135 , whereas they appear to be tightly wound in the sense that their arms can not be resolved after @xmath136 for model m10 with @xmath6 .",
    "these characteristics of the nuclear features show that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spiral arms open out as the central mass concentration @xmath0 decreases while keeping the gas sound speed @xmath37 constant . by comparing the winding angles corresponding to the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals of the models with constant values of @xmath0 in figure @xmath131 such as those mentioned above for models m1 and m8 that assume @xmath39 but different gas sound speeds of @xmath132 and @xmath42 km s@xmath9 , respectively ,",

    "in addition to the above nuclear features of the gaseous disks in models m1-m10 , figure @xmath131 also shows that the diameter of the nuclear disk depends on the central mass concentration @xmath0 and the gas sound speed @xmath37 .",
    "the models with high central mass concentrations allow a larger nuclear disk than those with low central mass concentrations .",
    "furthermore , a larger nuclear disk is also found in the models with low gas sound speeds . as a result ,",
    "a largest nuclear disk among our selected models is noticed in model m4 , which assumes @xmath40 and @xmath132 km s@xmath9 .      as shown in the previous section ,",

    "the mechanisms such as the hydrodynamic shocks @xcite and the gas density waves @xcite were proposed for the formation of such nuclear spirals in barred galaxies . since a significant role is played by the gas sound speed @xmath37 to decide whether the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals are formed by hydrodynamic shocks or by gas density waves ( cf .",
    "* ) , we are interested here to examine any such role of the central mass concentration @xmath0 . for this study , we mainly consider models m1-m4 , which have @xmath132 km s@xmath9 but different central mass concentrations of @xmath0 = 0 , 0.5 , 1 , and 1.5 , respectively . in order to see whether the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals shown in figure @xmath131 for models m1-m4 are made of shocked gas particles , we examine the distributions of gas particles that are shocked by supersonic flow , i.e. , @xmath137 @xcite , in the central kiloparsec of models m1-m4 at the evolution time of @xmath130 in figure @xmath138 .",
    "as can be seen in figure @xmath138 , the distributions of shocked gas particles in the central kiloparsec of models m1 and m2 reveal well - defined spiral patterns whose innermost parts extend up to winding angle of @xmath134 .",
    "these nuclear spiral shocks look very similar to the symmetric two - armed nuclear spiral patterns developed in figure @xmath131 for the distributions of all the gas particles in the central kiloparsec of models m1 and m2 . on the other hand",
    ", it is also apparent from figure @xmath138 that the distributions of shocked gas particles in the central kiloparsec of models m3 and m4 can not move inward in a curling manner after winding angle of @xmath139 .",
    "however , the distributions of all the gas particles in the central kiloparsec of models m3 and m4 show the development of symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals whose innermost parts extend up to winding angle of @xmath134 , as shown in figure @xmath131 .",
    "thus , our simulations suggest that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals of models m1 and m2 that respectively assume @xmath39 and @xmath5 are formed by hydrodynamic spiral shocks driven by the gravitational torque of the bar , whereas they can not be supported by the shocked gas particles for models m3 and m4 that respectively assume @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention here that the models with each of the remaining values of the gas sound speed ( i.e. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 km s@xmath9 ) show a similar effect of the central mass concentration @xmath0 on the formation of the nuclear spirals in barred galaxies to that shown in figure @xmath138 for the models with @xmath132 km s@xmath9 .",
    "symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals are suggested to be formed by the gas inflow across the ilr due to the loss of angular momentum at the shocks driven by the gravitational torque of the bar @xcite .",
    "thus , it is quite plausible that the central mass concentration @xmath0 can affect the gas inflow into central hundred parsec of models m1-m4 with @xmath132 km s@xmath9 , since figure @xmath138 shows that the central mass concentrations of @xmath39 and @xmath5 make physical conditions in which it is plausible for the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals to take the form of hydrodynamic shocks .",
    "this inspires us to examine the effect of the central mass concentration @xmath0 on the gas inflow into the central hundred parsec of models m1-m4 in detail .",
    "in order to do this , the time evolution of the fraction of gas particles accumulating inside the radial zone of @xmath140 kpc is shown in figure @xmath141 for models m1-m4 .",
    "the gas accumulated inside the radial zone of @xmath140 represents the gas inflow deep inside the ilr , since the oilr in model m1 and the ilrs in models m2-m4 are located around at @xmath63 kpc and @xmath7 kpc , respectively . as can be seen in figure @xmath141 , models m1-m4 show appreciable gas inflow into the central hundred parsec throughout the evolution .",

    ", the highest gas inflow rate is found for model m1 with @xmath39 whose mass is less centrally concentrated than models m2-m4 that assume @xmath144 , @xmath36 and @xmath7 , respectively .",

    "however , similar to @xcite and @xcite , the gas inflow rate increases when the gas sound speed increases from @xmath132 to @xmath42 km s@xmath9 .",
    "using the sph method , @xcite have found that when the gas in barred galaxies is modelled as an isothermal fluid , the gas flow morphology depends on the shape of the underlying potential and the sound speed .",
    "they noticed that the off - axis principal shocks with a nuclear ring developed by the gas flow at low sound speed turn into the on - axis ones with a straight inflow to the center when the sound speed is high .",
    "however , the resolutions of their simulations were not high enough to analyze the nuclear morphology in detail .",
    "our present sph simulations confirm their findings that not only the underlying potential , which can be greatly affected by the central mass concentration , but also the gas sound speed influence the morphology of the gas flow .    because of the better resolution of our sph simulations",
    ", we analyze the gas flows in the central kiloparsecs of barred galaxies , where the morphology of nuclear spirals is found to be dependent on the central mass concentration @xmath0 and the gas sound speed @xmath37 ( see   @xmath145 ) . the openness of the nuclear spiral arms increases as the central mass concentration decreases . increasing the gas sound speed has a comparable effect on the openness of nuclear spirals to that of decreasing the central mass concentration .",
    "this implies that the nuclear spiral arms also open out when the gas sound speed increases . as a result",
    ", the less centrally concentrated model with high gas sound speed ( i.e. , model m8 with @xmath39 and @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) shows more loosely wound nuclear spiral whose openness appears to be larger than those of the other selected models .",
    "this can be justified by the fact that the innermost parts of the nuclear spiral formed in model m8 extend all the way to the galactic center with winding angle of @xmath135 ( see   @xmath145 and fig .",
    "@xmath131 ) .",
    "a similar effect of the central mass concentration and the gas sound speed on the morphology of nuclear spirals was found by @xcite , although they used the two - dimensional grid - based hydrodynamics code zeus-2d .",
    "in addition to this , @xcite , who use the grid - based hydrodynamics code , have also found that the nuclear spiral opens out in the sense that its innermost parts reach very close to the galactic center when the gas sound increases from @xmath146 to @xmath42 km s@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite , who use the sph code , have found that the models with lower gas sound speeds allow a larger diameter of the nuclear disk than those with high gas sound speeds .",
    "here we have also found a similar effect of the gas sound speed on the diameter of the nuclear disk ( see   @xmath145 and fig .",
    "@xmath131 ) . beside this",
    ", we have noticed that the diameter of the nuclear disk increases as the central mass concentration @xmath0 increases . a similar effect of the central mass concentration and the gas sound speed on the diameter of the nuclear disk has been found by @xcite .",
    "thus , it is apparent that increasing the central mass concentration has a similar effect on the diameter of the nuclear disk to that of decreasing the gas sound speed .",
    "furthermore , it was also found by @xcite that the nuclear regions of the modeled gaseous disks evolve to trailing nuclear spirals whose morphologies depend on the gas sound speed in the presence of a central smbh that is massive enough to remove the iilr , whereas the lower gas sound speed model ( @xmath66 km s@xmath9 ) that has the existence of the iilr due to the absence of a central smbh evolves to a leading nuclear spiral . in general , the leading nuclear spirals are generated at the iilr because of the positive torque of the bar @xcite , while the trailing nuclear spirals at the oilr ( or at the ilr when there is no iilr ) are made by orbital switching from the @xmath147-orbits that align with the bar axis to the @xmath148-orbits perpendicular to the bar @xcite .",
    "we have not seen here any such existence of the leading nuclear spirals , since the masses of models with @xmath39 are sufficiently centrally concentrated to weaken the iilr by placing its location at the negligible distance from the galactic center ( see fig .",
    "@xmath36 ) .",
    "this makes physical conditions plausible for the development of trailing nuclear spirals in the models with @xmath39 whose innermost parts can reach the galactic center when the gas sound speed is high ( see fig .",
    "@xmath131 ) .",
    "a similar dependence of the morphology of trailing nuclear spirals on the gas sound speed was found for the models with @xmath149 that have only a single ilr due to the increase of central mass concentration from @xmath39 .",
    "the relative bar strength is important in galaxy morphological studied because phenomena such as the gas inflow can be affected in various ways to the effectiveness with which the bar potential influences the motion of gas in a galactic disk ( eg .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the relative bar strength defined by the maximum of the tangential - to - radial force ratio @xmath150 increases when the bulge becomes weak .",
    "we have found here that the gas inflow into the central hundred parsec increases as the central mass concentration decreases from @xmath40 to @xmath143 ( see   @xmath151 and fig .",
    "@xmath141 ) .",
    "this correlation between the amount of gas inflow close to the center and the central mass concentration can be understood if we consider the dependence of the relative bar strength @xmath150 on the strength of the bulge .",
    "since the relative bar strength @xmath150 increases as the bulge becomes weak with the decrease in central mass concentration @xmath0 , the gravitational torques of the bars would be stronger in the models with @xmath39 than in the models with @xmath40 .",
    "this provides favorable conditions for the gas particles in the models with @xmath39 to lose their angular momentum much faster than those in the models with @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the highest gas inflow rate is found for model m1 with @xmath39 ( see   @xmath151 and fig .",
    "@xmath141 ) , since the gas particles move inward because of the loss of angular momentum .",
    "apart from the relative bar strength , the gas inflow close to the center can also be understood by the ilr that exists only if the central mass concentration is large enough @xcite .",
    "the ilr is defined as the outer limit to which the @xmath148-orbits can extend @xcite .",
    "if the ilr is absent , the @xmath148-orbits do not exist , and strong gas inflow to the center can take place @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in figure @xmath131 , decreasing the central mass concentration from @xmath40 to @xmath143 corresponds to the decrease in the strength of the ilr in the sense that the diameter of the nuclear disk , which represents the region occupied by the @xmath148-orbits , decreases ( cf .",
    "this causes the highest gas inflow rate in the less centrally concentrated model ( eg . ,",
    "model m1 with @xmath39 ) , as suggested by @xcite .    using the sph method ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have found that the gas inflow inside the radial zone near the central regions increases with the gas sound speed .",
    "in addition to this , some previous simulations , which either use the sph code @xcite or the grid - based hydrodynamics code @xcite , also indicate that the gas inflow close to the center increases with the gas sound speed .",
    "although we have only presented here the effect of the central mass concentration on the gas inflow , a closer look at figure @xmath131 suggests a similar correlation between the amount of gas inflow close to the center and the gas sound speed to that found in previous simulations .",
    "this can be understood if we consider the findings of @xcite and @xcite that while the gas particles in the low sound speed mediums easily follow the @xmath148-orbits , the gas particles in the high sound speed mediums face more difficulty doing so .",
    "because of this reason , figure @xmath131 shows that the diameter of the nuclear disk , which represents the region occupied by the @xmath148-orbits , decreases when the gas sound speed increases from @xmath66 to @xmath42 km s@xmath9 ( cf .",
    "* ) , resulting in a large amount of gas inflow deep inside the ilr for the models with high gas sound speed ( @xmath152 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "thus , the above described correlations make physical conditions in which it is plausible for the innermost parts of nuclear spiral to reach very close to the center when the less centrally concentrated model with high gas sound speed is considered ( see fig .",
    "@xmath131 ) .      the gas density waves @xcite and the hydrodynamic shocks @xcite are two promising mechanisms proposed for the formation of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , the linear theory of gas density wave postulates the following : ( 1 ) the spiral pattern opens out as the gas sound speed increases ; ( 2 ) the spiral pattern does not extend beyond the iilr when two ilrs are present ; ( 3 ) when one ilr is present , the spiral pattern can exist between the center and the ilr .",
    "since the gas density waves can not propagate in regions where shocks are strong enough to drive a nonlinear response of gas flows , it can be applied to low - amplitude spirals where no shocks exist and the gas response can be considered a linear wave @xcite .",
    "however , it is worthwhile to mention that the gas density wave itself is triggered by the spiral shocks driven by the gravitational torque of the bar @xcite .",
    "the grid - based hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite show that the gas sound speed plays a significant role to decide whether the nuclear spirals are formed by gas density waves or by hydrodynamic shocks . in their low gas",
    "sound speed run ( @xmath10 km s@xmath9 ) , the nuclear spiral is weak and rather tightly wound that creates at most a factor of @xmath131 density enhancement over the interarm region .",
    "moreover , it terminates just outside the iilr , and its shock strength , as measured by div@xmath153 for div @xmath154 , is @xmath155 times smaller than that of the principal shock .",
    "this suggests that the nuclear spiral in their low gas sound speed run ( @xmath10 km s@xmath9 ) can be well understood in terms of the gas density waves . on the other hand , the strong shock nature of nuclear spiral is found by @xcite in their high gas sound speed run ( @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) .",
    "they have found that the strong loosely wound nuclear spiral is a direct continuation of the principal shock along the leading edge of the bar , which generally agrees with the linear theory of gas density wave that postulates a open nuclear spiral for a high gas sound speed ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the nuclear spiral reaches close to the nucleus well beyond the iilr where the gas density waves can not penetrate .",
    "in addition to this , the shock strength ( i.e. , div@xmath153 for div @xmath154 ) and the arm / interarm density contrast of the nuclear spiral are comparable to those of the principal shocks .",
    "this indicates that the nuclear spiral in their high gas sound speed run ( @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ) is definitely well beyond the linear regime explored in the density wave theory where sound waves can not propagate in regions for which shocks are strong .",
    "our previous sph simulations in the high sound speed mediums @xcite also show the strong shock nature of nuclear spirals . in these simulations",
    ", we have found that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals are formed by hydrodynamic shocks in the presence of a central smbh that can remove iilr when the gas sound speed is high enough to drive a large amount of gas inflow deep inside the ilr .    like the role of gas sound speed as described above ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we have found here that the central mass concentration also play a significant role in the mechanism responsible for the formation of the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals in barred galaxies .",
    "our present sph simulations show that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spiral arms open out as the gas sound speed increases ( see   @xmath145 and ",

    "nevertheless , the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals of the models with @xmath39 and @xmath5 can not be explained by gas density waves , since they are supported by the gas particles that are shocked by supersonic flow ( see   @xmath157 and fig .",

    "@xmath138 ) and their arms open out when the gas sound speed increases , they can be well understood in terms of the gas density waves .",
    "this suggests that the symmetric two - armed nuclear spirals formed by hydrodynamic shocks turn into those explained by gas density waves when the central mass concentration increases from @xmath3 to @xmath7 .",
    "since the relative strength of bars in the models with @xmath39 is stronger than that in the models with @xmath40 ( see   @xmath156 ) , our results appear to confirm the findings of the grid - based hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite that the nuclear spirals developed in the models with strong bars have the nature of shocks in gas , whereas those formed in the models with weak ovals can be explained in terms of the gas density waves .",
    "in addition to this , @xcite seems to support our findings that the nuclear spirals formed by hydrodynamic shocks trigger a large amount of gas inflow than those explained in terms of the gas density waves .",
    "although our present sph simulations and the grid - based hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite show a similar effect of the central mass concentration and the gas sound speed on the morphology of nuclear spirals ( see   @xmath156 ) , the shock nature of nuclear spiral was not found by @xcite .",
    "they have found the low - amplitude nuclear spirals , which can be explained by gas density waves because the spiral arms open out as the gas sound speed increases . on the other hand ,",
    "we have found here that the nuclear spirals can be formed either by hydrodynamic shocks or by gas density waves , depending on the value of central mass concentration @xmath0 .",
    "it appears that the different assumptions of the mass models along with the adoption of the different hydrodynamics codes might play some role in creating this discrepancy between our present simulations and those of @xcite .      after performing the sph simulations with @xmath158 and @xmath159 sph particles for the response of the gaseous disk to the imposition of nonaxisymmetric bar potentials",
    ", @xcite claimed that the morphology of gas inflow does not depend on the number of sph particles for @xmath83 larger than @xmath158 .",
    "this encourages us to check whether the number of sph particles causes any major changes in our results discussed in the previous sections .",
    "thus , we have repeated our simulations for models m1-m10 with @xmath160 sph particles that give the initial resolution of @xmath161 pc . since we are mainly interested to examine whether the number of sph particles affects our results discussed in    3.2 and 4.2 regarding the role of the central mass concentration @xmath0 in the mechanism responsible for the formation of the nuclear spirals in barred galaxies",

    "this implies that similar to our simulations with @xmath158 sph particles ( see     3.1 and 4.1 ) , the nuclear spiral arms formed in all the models with @xmath160 sph particles also open out as the gas sound speed @xmath37 increases .",
