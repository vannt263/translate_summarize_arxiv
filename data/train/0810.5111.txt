    "a large amount of work has been devoted to the understanding of the rheology of suspensions due to its ubiquitousness and the central role that they play in many technological processes . to control",
    "the structure and flow properties of such suspensions is of crucial practical importance . due to its many body character ,",
    "the study of the rheology of these systems is extremely difficult , even the simplest suspension , composed of identical hard spheres , show rather complex rheological phenomena . since einstein s calculation of the viscosity for a dilute suspension of spheres @xcite , a lot of effort has been devoted to the extension of einstein s result to more concentrated suspensions in which correlations among particles must be taken into account .",
    "however , in spite of the remarkable works which make central contributions to the understanding of the rheology of concentrated suspensions @xcite-@xcite , the problem still constitutes a challenge for theoretical description @xcite .",
    "essentially , most of these works introduce particle correlations by taking into account hydrodynamic interactions , and provide a conceptual framework that explains how these interactions modify the behavior of the viscosity as a function of the volume fraction @xmath0 for arbitrary values of the wave vector and the frequency : @xmath1 .",
    "sometimes , these approaches provide compact expressions for the effective viscosity , although usually a multipole expansion must be done in order to obtain numerical values @xcite .",
    "beenakker @xcite , by neglecting brownian motion , gave a theory for the concentration and wave - vector dependence of the viscosity valid up to high concentrations that fully takes into account the many - body hydrodynamic interactions between an arbitrary number of spheres .",
    "batchelor and green @xcite developed a theory for the evaluation of the bulk stress in a semi - dilute suspensions of hard spheres . by neglecting brownian motion and assuming a random particle distribution they found the following expression for the viscosity @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the solvent viscosity and @xmath0 is the volume fraction .",
    "this result has been regarded as the high - frequency value of the real part of the complex shear viscosity @xcite .",
    "a different result is obtained if brownian motion is taken into account .",
    "then appears an extra term accounting for the stresses generated in the dispersion by the random movements of the particles .",
    "numerical calculations performed in ref .",
    "@xcite lead to the formula @xmath4 considered as the low - shear and zero - frequency value of the real part of the complex shear viscosity because in the calculation brownian motion dominates @xcite .",
    "bedeaux and collaborators @xcite introduced a general formalism for the calculation of the effective shear viscosity for a suspension of spheres as a function of the wave vector and the frequency for arbitrary values of the volume fraction . using the conservation law for the total momentum density of the fluid and the suspended spheres",
    ", they perform a multipole expansion of the one sphere response function to second order in the wave - vector and an expansion in the volume fraction up to the second order , obtaining the expression @xmath5 russel and gast @xcite formulated a theory for the nonequilibrium structure and stresses in a sheared suspension with a fluid rest state .",
    "many body interactions were handled exactly in the thermodynamics but truncated at the pair level for the hydrodynamics .",
    "more recently , on the basis of the pair smoluchowski equation , cichocki and felderhof @xcite have obtained exact results for @xmath6 to @xmath7 . without brownian motion contributions , their result for @xmath8 is @xmath9 while with brownian motion contributions they find @xmath10 verberg and collaborators @xcite presented an approximate theory based on the contribution of two physically relevant processes taking place at different time scales : ( i ) at short time scales the viscosity of the suspension increases when compared to that of the pure solvent at infinite dilution due to the finite probability to find two particles at contact , whereas ( ii ) at long times it is difficult for a brownian particle to diffuse out of the cage formed around it by its neighbors . for @xmath8 these authors obtain the approximate result @xmath11 while for @xmath12 they propose @xmath13 which is accurate for all @xmath14 .",
    "although their results compare reasonably well with experimental data , they are based in a number of assumptions not completely justified , as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the simple formulas reviewed are of fundamental importance for the understanding of the rheology of suspensions . however , these formulas are far from satisfactory since they only lead to good quantitative results in the low volume fraction regime @xcite .",
    "this restriction have lead to many works searching for simple procedures or semi - empirical expressions to calculate the viscosity of suspensions and dispersions at frequencies and shear rates relevant to industrial applications @xcite .",
    "several phenomenological formulas@xcite have been proposed in order to fit experiments in the largest possible range of volume fractions .",
    "for example , krieger and dougherty found empirically @xcite that the expression @xmath15 with @xmath16 the filling fraction at maximum packing , agrees reasonably well with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , this relation reduces to the correct einstein equation in the limit of infinite dilution .",
    "other example is the following expression obtained by quemada @xcite @xmath17 which gives the right divergence for @xmath18 as @xmath0 approaches @xmath19 , but , it does not reduces to einstein s expression for low @xmath0 .",
    "nonetheless , although useful , these expressions lack of physical support and therefore do not provide insight about the phenomenology of the system .    in this article , we explore a different approach to the problem leading to a simple an quantitatively powerful description of concentrated suspensions of mono- and poly - disperse suspensions of colloidal particles .",
    "our model assumes that at macroscopic length and time scales , the suspension can be considered as a truly continuum medium .",
    "however , the precise formulas are derived only by considering the discrete nature of the suspended phase through its possible configurations and poly - dispersion .",
    "the technique we will adopt has been introduced long time ago in the context of different physical properties of dispersed systems@xcite-@xcite , including optical@xcite and nonlocal dielectric systems @xcite . in the case of rheological properties ,",
    "a limited success has been obtained when comparing with experimental results because the geometrical information of the system has poorly been included @xcite . in this work , we improve previous results by incorporating structural information from the start through an effective filling fraction .",
    "moreover , in order to better understand some of the assumptions implicit in the differential technique , we perform a mesoscopic analysis of the problem by using fokker - planck equations @xcite .",
    "this analysis allows us to elucidate the main assumptions and approximations underlying the differential method .",
    "the article is organized as follows , in section ii we introduce our differential effective medium model . in section iii",
    "we perform an analysis of the model based on a mesoscopic and hydrodynamic approach . in section",
    "iv we compare the predictions of our model with previous theories and with various experimental results .",
    "finally section iv is devoted to conclusions .",
    "at very low volume fractions , the shear viscosity @xmath18 of a suspension of hard spheres can be predicted by the simple formula @xcite @xmath20 that einstein calculated from the viscous dissipation produced by the flow around a single sphere .",
    "notice that expression ( [ einstein ] ) does not take into consideration the way in which the spheres are arranged in the sample .",
    "therefore it contains no information about the maximum packing of spheres the system may allocate .",
    "this information is not relevant for very low volume fractions , nonetheless it does matter for higher concentration of spheres .",
    "even more , einstein s expression contains no information about the radii of the spheres and it may be applied to any polydisperse distribution of spheres at low volume fractions giving to it its universal character .    in order to extend einstein s expression to larger",
    "filling fractions @xmath0 we use a differential effective medium approach . for this purpose",
    ", it is important to consider that experimental results show that the viscosity diverges at volume fractions @xmath21 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the spheres can not occupy all the volume of the sample due to geometrical restrictions .",
    "for example , for a face centered cubic ( fcc ) arrangement of identical spheres , the maximum volume that the spheres may occupy is larger than for a random arrangement of spheres . at some point , the spheres become arrested giving rise to the divergence of the viscosity .",
    "these considerations suggest that the relevant quantity in expression ( [ einstein ] ) is not @xmath0 but an _ effective _ filling fraction @xmath22 that incorporates geometrical information .",
    "we propose the following expression for @xmath22:@xmath23 where @xmath24 is a structural or crowding factor that takes into account the arrangements of the spheres in the suspension and is given by @xmath25 with @xmath16 the filling fraction at maximum packing .",
    "the main characteristic of @xmath22 is that it is the most simple way to incorporate geometrical information having the characteristic that @xmath26 at low volume fractions and @xmath27 at maximum packing .",
    "the introduction of @xmath22 is analogous to the excluded volume correction proposed by van der waals to incorporate the finite size of the molecules in the equation of state of the ideal gas .",
    "in fact , considering the excluded volume correction , the equation of state of an ideal gas is replaced by @xmath28 , with @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the number density of molecules in the volume @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the volume of each molecule . in our case , the excluded volume is due not only to the finite size of the spheres but also to the volume that is not accessible to other spheres due to their geometrical arrangement .",
    "the differential effective medium theory ( demt ) is based in a progressive addition of spheres to the sample .",
    "consider a suspension of spheres with a filling fraction @xmath22 . then",
    ", suppose that we increase by @xmath33 the particle concentration in the suspension of viscosity @xmath34 by adding a small quantity @xmath35 of few new particles .",
    "if we treat the suspension into which we add these particles as a _ homogeneous _ effective medium of viscosity @xmath34 , then the new viscosity can be written as@xmath36 where the added quantity of new spheres is related to @xmath37 by@xmath38 the normalizing factor that appears in eq.([deltaphi ] ) is due to the fact that one has to remove part of the effective medium in order to allocate the new particles , in other words , the new fraction of spheres is given by @xmath39 , from which we find @xmath40 .",
    "integrating eq.([recursive1 ] ) we obtain@xmath41 this expression is similar to the empirical proposals of @xcite , eq.([krieger ] ) , and @xcite , eq.([quemada ] ) , and also to other differential effective medium theories@xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , our model crucially makes use of the geometrical information of the system from the start through @xmath22 .",
    "this results in an huge improvement of the quantitative description when compared to experimental data as will be shown in section iv .",
    "thus , eq . ( [ viscosity1 ] ) is a powerful expression accounting for a variety of situations ranging from disordered to ordered system of spheres , or to systems with poly - dispersion of sizes .",
    "even more , by an appropriate choice of the coefficient of the @xmath0 term in eq.([einstein ] ) it can also be applied to other systems ranging from emulsions to arbitrarily shaped particles .",
    "the model of a concentrated suspension of particles formulated in the previous section essentially considers the superposition of dilute suspensions of particles added in a heat bath at different stages . at each stage ,",
    "the heat bath is considered as an effective continuum medium with an effective viscosity depending on the volume fraction of the particles added up to the previous stage .",
    "the assumption that the heat bath is a continuum medium has physical implications that can be elucidated by performing a mesoscopic analysis of the dynamics of the system .    in non - equilibrium conditions imposed by a stationary flow @xmath42 , the dynamics of a dilute gas  of brownian particles of mass @xmath43 suspended in a newtonian heat bath",
    "can be analyzed by means of a fokker - planck equation for the single - particle probability distribution function @xcite .",
    "when the volume fraction of the suspended particles is finite , hydrodynamic interactions play an important role and then the description is usually performed by using a @xmath44particle distribution function obeying a multivariate fokker - planck or smoluchowski equations @xcite .",
    "however , to understand the physical assumptions underlying the differential model previously introduced , we will follow a similar procedure in which , at each stage , the new particles added constitute a dilute suspension in an effective continuum medium . under this assumption",
    ", the dynamics of the system can be performed by means of the single - particle probability distribution @xmath45 , depending on time @xmath46 and the instantaneous position @xmath47 and velocity @xmath48 of the particles .",
    "assuming that the corresponding fluctuation - dissipation theorem is valid for the actual non - equilibrium steady - state @xcite , it is possible to show that @xmath49 obeys the fokker - planck equation @xmath50   , \\label{f - p}%\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the thermal energy ( assumed constant ) and @xmath53 is the friction coefficient per mass unit of a particle . here , @xmath54 is the stationary solution of the navier - stokes equation @xmath55 for the heat bath , with the appropriate boundary conditions on the surface of the particle and @xmath56 is the constant density of the bath .",
    "equations similar to ( [ f - p ] ) have been derived for related systems where the external flow introduces corrections leading to the breaking of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite . here",
    ", we will assume that eq .",

    "( [ diffusive ] ) , we have neglected contributions of the order @xmath70 .",
    "the last equation can be separated into two equations by considering @xmath71 , with @xmath72 the traceless stress tensor .",
    "then , one obtains an evolution equation for the pressure @xmath73 , and other one for the non - diagonal terms @xmath74 , associated with the dissipation in the system . assuming that the diagonal part relaxes faster than the other components , one has the state equation @xmath75 .",
    "on the other hand , the resulting evolution equation for @xmath74 can be recasted in the form @xmath76 where we have used the definition of the local diffusion current @xmath77 and neglected terms of the order @xmath78 .",

    "in this section we compare the predictions of the improved demt with several experimental results and with the results obtained from other theories . to carry out these comparisons ,",

    "this is done in fig .",
    "1 , where the behavior of the relative viscosity @xmath138 is compared with experimental results of de kruif _ et al . _ @xcite and of krieger @xcite for high and low - shear rates as a function of the volume fraction @xmath0 .",
    "the lower curve is the prediction of eq.([viscosity1 ] ) with @xmath139 , which corresponds to fcc close packing .",
    "this gives an excellent agreement with the experimental results for the case of high - shear rates .",
    "the upper curve represents the prediction of eq.([viscosity1 ] ) with @xmath140 , which corresponds to the random close packing ( rcp ) of identical spheres .",
    "the comparison with the experimental results for low - shear rates is again excellent .",
    "these results are consistent with the known fact that for low - shear rates the spheres remain disordered while at high - shear rates the equilibrium microstructure of the dispersion is completely destroyed and the spheres adopt an ordered fcc configuration . in fig .",
    "2 we use again the value @xmath141 to compare our theory with the experimental results obtained by saunders @xcite , by krieger and coworkers@xcite , and by kops - werkhoven and fijnaut@xcite .",
    "we also plot the calculated values obtained by beenakker@xcite with a theory that fully takes into account the many - body hydrodynamic interactions between an arbitrary number of spheres .",
    "notice again that the agreement with the experimental results is excellent over the entire fluid range .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare @xmath138 with the reduced viscosity measurements by van der werff _",
    "_ @xcite and by zhu _",
    "_ @xcite at high frequencies .",

    "similarly , fig .",
    "4 shows the zero frequency low - shear viscosity as obtained by our model using @xmath141 , and it is compared with experimental results and the model of verberg _ et al .",
    "again , a very good agreement is found .",
    "a more sensitive representation of the relative viscosity data is the one proposed by bedeaux @xcite : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is an unknown function of the volume fraction . in fig . 5",
    ", we represent the function @xmath144 for various experimental results obtained in a variety of experimental situations and compare with the values obtained with our model .",
    "we take the same values of @xmath16 used previously for the low- and high - shear cases .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is again very good .",
    "the last set of experimental points corresponds to the high - frequency limit of the real part of the complex viscosity as obtained by the linear dynamic measurements performed by van der werff and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the best fit to the real part , obtained with @xmath145 gives an excellent agreement with the experimental values .",
    "as a comparative , we also show the predictions for the high - frequency limit , obtained by beenakker @xcite , by batchelor and green @xcite , by russel and gast @xcite , and by verberg _",
    "in this very sensitive representation it is seen that only the improved demt matches the data at all volume fractions .    finally , let us notice that the functional form  for the reduced viscosity in the improved demt as given by eq.([viscosity1 ] ) makes no reference to any material parameter neither to the geometrical information of the system .",
    "this means that a plot of the reduced viscosity @xmath146 vs. @xmath22 should be independent of the experimental details or of the sample .",

    "the straight line is the prediction of the improved demt , eq.([viscosity1 ] ) .",
    "as can be seen , the generality of the correlation and the agreement with our model is quite remarkable .",
    "now we proceed to compare our expression for the viscosity with the functional form of other theories .",
    "first , let us notice that putting @xmath148 in the denominator of eq.([phieff ] ) and replacing the factor @xmath149 by @xmath150 in eq.([einstein ] ) we obtain the well known empirical expression obtained by quemada @xcite , eq.([quemada ] ) .",
    "this expression although gives the right divergence at high filling fractions does not have the correct low volume fraction limit given by einstein s expression .    on the other hand ,",
    "putting @xmath151 in the denominator of eq.([deltaphi ] ) we recover the empirical expression obtained by krieger and dougherty @xcite , eq.([krieger ] ) .",
    "nonetheless the virial expansion of this expression gives values for the second virial coefficient , @xmath152 , that are too small @xcite .",
    "a generalization of this model but including a dependence of the crowding factor on the volume fraction was proposed by van de ven @xcite .",
    "however this model has the shortcoming that gives rise to an expression for the viscosity that is more involved and it includes a second adjustable parameter besides @xmath16 which is chosen in order to adjust the second virial coefficient to the values predicted by other theories .",
    "in contrast , our proposal does not contain adjustable parameters besides @xmath16 and the series expansion gives the right values for the second virial coefficient in a natural way as it is shown below .",
    "expanding eq.([viscosity1 ] ) in power series of @xmath0 for specific choices of @xmath16 allows one to compare the improved demt with other theories . choosing the rcp value for the volume fraction at maximum packing , @xmath153",
    ", we obtain up to @xmath154 @xmath155 which compares very well up to second order with the result that cichoki and felderhof @xcite have obtained on the basis of the pair smoluchowski equation which are exact @xmath7 . with brownian motion contributions they find for the second virial coefficient @xmath156 [ see eq.([cichocki2 ] ) ] .",

    "this value is @xmath167 and produces the following series expansion up to @xmath168 , just to show a few terms @xmath169 which is exact up to @xmath7 with the series expansion of the result by verberg _",
    "_ et al.__which reads @xmath170 and the higher order terms are also amazingly close .",
    "in summary , we have formulated an improved differential effective medium theory that accounts for the dependence of the viscosity of hard - spheres suspensions at arbitrary volume fractions .",
    "this theory takes into consideration geometrical information of the system from the start through an effective filling fraction and assumes a hierarchy of relaxation times , as we have shown by performing a mesoscopic analysis based on fokker - planck equations .",
    "the agreement with experimental data at low- and high - shear rates and in the high - frequency limit is remarkable and superior to other theories .",
    "also , the virial expansion of our model compares well with the second virial coefficient obtained by a number of different theories in all the regimes considered . in the particular case of the high - frequency limit , it is possible to find a value for @xmath16 for which the virial expansion is amazingly close to higher orders to that of the model by verberg _",
    "et al_. although our proposal can be generalized to describe the viscoelastic behavior at @xmath171 by simply allowing @xmath16 to take complex values , we have not a derivation based on simple physical arguments to justify this generalization .",

    "<S> we propose a simple and general model accounting for the dependence of the viscosity of a hard sphere suspension at arbitrary volume fractions . the model constitutes a continuum - medium description based on a recursive - differential method that assumes a hierarchy of relaxation times . </S>",
    "<S> geometrical information of the system is introduced through an effective volume fraction that approaches the usual filling fraction at low concentrations and becomes one at maximum packing . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement of our expression for the viscosity with experiments at low- and high - shear rates and in the high - frequency limit is remarkable for all volume fractions . </S>"
