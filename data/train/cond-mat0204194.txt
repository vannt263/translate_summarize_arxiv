    "one of the long standing unsolved problems in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) of high-@xmath0 cuprates was the detection of band doubling in bilayer materials . in these compounds",
    "one naturally expects a splitting of the quasiparticle ( qp ) dispersion in an antibonding ( ab ) and bonding band ( bb ) due to finite hopping of charge carriers between the two cuo@xmath2 planes .",
    "only recently this feature has been measured in bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath3 ( bi2212 ) @xcite above and below @xmath0 .",
    "the splitting turns out to be essentially zero along the diagonals @xmath4 and ( in the normal state ) aquires a value between @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite at the @xmath7 point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "in addition it seems that the magnitude of the energy splitting is constant over a large range of doping .",
    "@xcite most interestingly it turns out that for the same doping the splitting is only @xmath8 below @xmath0 @xcite contrary to the expectation that the hopping between planes @xmath9 should be essentially temperature independent .    in this paper",
    "we show that the apparent reduction of the bilayer splitting below @xmath0 can be explained by the assumption that the charge carriers are coupled to bosons which frequency distribution evolves from a featureless structure well above @xmath0 ( i.e. approaching that of a marginal fermi liquid @xcite ) to a sharp , mode - like excitation at small temperatures . as a consequence ,",
    "low energy qp excitations are essentially confined to energies up to the mode frequency @xmath10 which thus constitutes an upper limit for the splitting between ab and bb qp peaks ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . moreover , the damping of excitations for energies larger than @xmath10 leads to a broad hump which turns out to be mainly determined by the bonding band ( cf .",
    "this scenario is thus in agreement with recent arpes experiments @xcite where this peak - dip hump structure at @xmath7 has been resolved below @xmath0 in addition to the bilayer splitting .",
    "numerous experiments now support the existence of a collective mode in the high-@xmath0 materials most prominently exemplified by the appearance of a kink in the electron dispersion along @xmath4 as seen in arpes @xcite ( cf . also fig .",
    "2 ) . concerning the origin of the mode",
    "the various proposals include a magnetic resonance ( see e.g. ref . ) , the coupling to phonons @xcite or incommensurate charge - density waves ( icdw ) @xcite as the source of the associated scattering .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the difference between peak and dip position of the photoemission line shape at @xmath7 decreases as a function of doping as it is expected for the magnetic resonance frequency .",
    "an analagous analysis @xcite came to the conclusion that the frequency is essentially constant ( if not slightly decreasing ) upon doping thus resembling the behavior of a phonon mode .",
    "we have recently fitted @xcite arpes data taking into account also the feedback of the doping dependent superconducting ( sc ) gap .",
    "the extracted mode frequency is a strongly decreasing function of hole concentration reaching a value of @xmath11 around optimal doping .",
    "this behavior is thus consistent with a quantum critical point ( qcp ) located near optimal doping where the associated order parameter corresponds to icdw formation .",
    "@xcite in fact , the formation of stripe order is now well established in a large class of cuprate compounds ( for an overview see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "most interestingly the coexistence of charge modulations and superconductivity has recently also been reported for the bi2212 compound using scanning tunneling microscopy .",
    "@xcite these experiments strongly support our view that icdw scattering can also be responsible for the mode - like features as seen in arpes experiments . in the following",
    "we substantiate this scenario by a detailed analysis of the temperature dependent collective mode which allows us to fit the experimentally observed bilayer splitting in the superconducting and normal state respectively by simply tuning the broadening of our phenomoneological bosonic spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we analyze available experimental data in order to elucidate the frequency and temperature dependence of the collective mode in bi2212 materials . based on these results the temperature dependent bilayer splitting is investigated within the icdw mode scenario in sec .",
    "we finally conclude our discussion in sec .",
    "the coupling of charge carriers to a collective mode is reflected in a drop of the imaginary part of the electronic self - energy i m @xmath1 below some characteristic mode frequency @xmath10 . in refs .",
    "the arpes line width , which is directly related to i m @xmath1 , has been analyzed for an optimally doped bi2212 sample ( @xmath0=90k ) as a function of frequency and temperature .",
    "in fact , it was observed that in the sc state i m @xmath1 is strongly reduced below @xmath12 which compares rather well with the drop of the scattering rate as obtained from infrared reflectivity measurements .",
    "@xcite moreover , with increasing temperature there is a gradual change of i m @xmath1 towards a linear frequency dependence above @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding marginal fermi liquid ( mfl ) structure of the arpes line shape is also discussed in ref . .",
    "in order to interpolate between these two limiting self - energies we consider the coupling of charge carriers to the following bosonic spectrum : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a normalized distribution function centered around @xmath10 with halfwidth @xmath15 . assuming particle - hole symmetry with respect to the chemical potential and neglecting for the moment the influence of the sc gap @xcite , evaluation of the @xmath16 self - energy yields @xmath17 here @xmath18 denotes the coupling constant , @xmath19 corresponds to the density of states at the chemical potential and @xmath20 is an upper cutoff energy for the interaction .    in the limit @xmath21 where @xmath22 eqs .",

    "@xcite in fact it was found that @xmath36 drops significantly as temperature approaches @xmath0 with a small but nonzero @xmath36 also above @xmath0 . from eq .",

    "the result is displayed in the inset of fig .",
    "this plot shows that in the sc state @xmath33 continuously increases and reaches the mfl limit ( i.e. @xmath38 ) for @xmath39 .    with the extracted @xmath40like form for @xmath33",
    "we now evaluate the temperature and frequency dependence of i m @xmath1 for parameters which also fit the real part ( see below ) . in fig.1",
    "we compare our results with arpes data on an optimally doped bi2212 sample @xcite which support a scaling of i m @xmath1 as a function of @xmath32 characteristic for a mfl .",
    "however , from the remarkable agreement of our fit with experiment as shown in fig .",
    "1 we conclude that the presence of a collective mode in the @xmath41 data can not be excluded",
    ". we will see below that this is also consistent with the observed temperature dependence of re @xmath1 as required by the kramers - kronig transformation .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath33 was obtained from a fit to the quasiparticle weight at @xmath7 whereas the experimental data shown in fig .",
    "1 are extracted from momentum distribution curves along the nodal direction .",
    "for large frequencies i m @xmath42 and thus in our scaled representation fig .",

    "@xcite note that parameters are the same for both temperatures except the broadening @xmath15 which in the normal state is five times the value of that in the sc state . from our fit",
    "we thus again conclude that the increase of temperature alone is not sufficient in order to explain the change of re @xmath1 from being significantly peaked at @xmath43 to the much broader structure at @xmath44 .",
    "instead the transition from @xmath45 to @xmath46 is accompanied by the transformation of the self - energy from mode - like to almost mfl behavior due to the broadening of the underlying bosonic spectrum eq .",

    "2c , 2d ) this break gradually changes into a kink which in the mfl limit ( @xmath55 ) reduces to a slight change of slope in the dispersion .    as already discussed in the introduction the kink in the dispersion along the nodal direction",
    "is now well established in a large class of cuprates .",
    "@xcite moreover arpes experiments on underdoped bi2212 materials ( cf . fig .",
    "2c of ref . )",
    "clearly support the existence of a break also in the nodal direction corresponding to the situation shown in fig .",
    "2b . increasing doping or ( and ) increasing temperature leads to a decreased change of slope ( i.e. less pronounced kink ) around a characteristic binding energy ( cf . figs .",
    "1b , e of ref . ) . comparing with the spectra shown in fig .",
    "2b-2d all these data suggest that the charge carriers are coupled to a bosonic spectrum which is rather sharply peaked well below @xmath0 but gradually broadens with increasing temperature .",
    "in addition from the doping dependence of the kink we conclude that the minimum @xmath15 is smaller in the underdoped regime .",
    "having analyzed the temperature and frequency behavior of the bosonic spectrum we now proceed by investigating its influence on the experimentally observed bilayer splitting in the sc and normal state of bi2212 materials , respectively .",

    "the system eq .",
    "( [ h0 ] ) is now coupled to icdw type fluctuations via the action @xmath63 where the susceptibility matrix contains both intra- ( @xmath64 ) and interlayer ( @xmath65 ) contributions . following the approach in ref .",

    "note that for the chosen sign convention in eq .",
    "( [ seff ] ) this kind of scattering leads to an effective attraction ( in the static limit ) between holes in the same plane .",
    "however , for the interlayer susceptibility the situation is different since the coulomb repulsion perpendicular to the layers is only weakly screened and it is thus more likely to assume an effective repulsive interaction between holes in adjacent layers . for simplicity",
    "we therefore take in the following @xmath74 with @xmath75 in order to describe the physical situation where charge enhanced regions in one layer correspond to charge depleted areas in the other layer . in this regard",
    "the situation is analogous to af correlated spin fluctuations between the planes @xcite when the spin - exchange potential couples exclusively even and odd electron states .",
    "we therefore consider our approach as complementary to models which are based on the magnetic resonance as the relevant collective mode .",

    "curve s4 in fig .",
    "the stronger renormalization of the bb band is due to the fact that ( for our choice @xmath74 ) the self energies of ab and bb bands @xmath96 are determined by fermionic excitations of bb and ab bands , respectively . since the van - hove singularity of the bb band is well separated from the chemical potential this results in a small ab self - energy and thus a relatively weak ab hump feature .",
    "in contrast the closeness of the ab van - hove singularity to @xmath97 induces large bb self - energy effects and therefore a more pronounced bb hump structure .",
    "the sc low energy quasiparticle peaks are confined to energies smaller than @xmath10 and the corresponding quasiparticle weight decreases with increasing binding energy . as a consequence the quasiparticle peak of the bonding band",
    "is strongly suppressed at @xmath87 ( curve s0 in fig .",

    "4 displays one of the main results of this paper .",
    "whereas in the normal state the bilayer splitting is around @xmath99 the low energy peaks in the sc state are separated by @xmath100 only . as already discussed above the decreased bilayer splitting in the sc state is only due to the sharpening of the collective mode at low temperatures and not influenced by any other parameter in our calculation .",
    "to conclude , we have shown that the self - energy as extracted from arpes experiments can be consistently described within a model where the charge carriers are coupled to a bosonic distribution centered around some mean frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the width @xmath15 of this spectrum turns out to be strongly temperature dependent as can be concluded from the temperature dependent quasiparticle weight ( cf .",

    "2a with temperature . within the icdw scenario",
    "the associated scattering can account for the experimentally observed @xcite appearance of an additional peak - dip hump structure below t@xmath101 near the @xmath7 points of the bz ( curve s4 in fig .",
    "moreover , the strong qp mass enhancement below t@xmath102 due to the small value of @xmath15 leads to an apparent reduction of the bilayer splitting and a suppression of bb spectral weight around the @xmath7 points ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    note that phonons can not account for the temperature dependence of the collective mode although their linewidth may undergoe some sharpening upon entering the sc state . for temperatures well below the phonon frequency",
    "one can estimate the linewidth @xcite from @xmath103 which yields @xmath104 also for large coupling @xmath105 .",
    "this is not enough to account for the strong damping as discussed above .    on the other hand the temperature dependent width of the bosonic spectrum",
    "can at least be made plausible within the icdw scenario . at low temperatures",
    "the large intensity cdw mode at energy @xmath10 and wave vecors @xmath106 is part of a band of excitations which for @xmath107 corresponds to the phason mode of the system .",
    "it is known @xcite that the effective mass of the phason strongly increases with temperature due to the decreasing cdw gap inducing a significant broadening of the bandwidth of charge excitations .",
    "in fact , preliminary results obtained for the stripe phase of the hubbard model @xcite near the cdw transition have already revealed a rather continuous frequency spectrum in the charge susceptibility centered around @xmath108 corresponding to the stripe periodicity .",
    "however , a more detailed investigation of this temperature dependence remains an interesting issue for future work .",

    "<S> we argue that the origin of the collective mode is associated with dynamic incommensurate charge density waves . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it is shown that the resulting temperature dependence of the self - energy @xmath1 is in good agreement with that extracted from angle - resolved photoemission data . </S>"
