    "the basic assumption in the ekrt framework is that the initial transverse energy production in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions can be calculated by using perturbative qcd and collinear factorization , and that the production is locally controlled by a semi - hard saturation scale @xmath2 @xcite .    using hydrodynamics with the ekrt initial conditions ,",
    "we show that we can describe a multitude of low-@xmath0 observables simultaneously at rhic and lhc energies , and constrain the qcd @xmath3 @xcite . moreover , once the model parameters are fixed at one collision energy , the results for the other collision energies are predictions , and we can predict the low-@xmath0 observables in 5.023 tev pb+pb collisions at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the minijet transverse energy @xmath4 produced into the rapidity interval @xmath5 per unit transverse area in @xmath6 collisions can be computed by using collinear factorization as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the transverse momentum cut - off scale , @xmath9 is the transverse coordinate and @xmath10 is the impact parameter and @xmath11 is the nuclear thickness function .",
    "the basic input to the calculation of @xmath12 are the nlo pqcd partonic cross - sections @xcite and the nuclear parton distributions @xcite .",

    "the cut - off scale @xmath15 is obtained from the nlo generalization @xcite of the ekrt saturation condition @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a free parameter .",

    "the event - by - event fluctuations enter through the fluctuations in @xmath11 .",
    "these are calculated by first sampling the nucleon positions from the woods - saxon nucleon density profiles , and then setting a gaussian transverse density around each nucleon , with width @xmath21 fm , obtained from the measurements of @xmath22 electroproduction @xcite .",

    "the measurement of the multiplicity in @xmath30 % most central collisions is used to fix the proportionality constant @xmath17 .",
    "the studied @xmath3 parametrizations lead to different entropy production during the evolution , and therefore @xmath17 must be fixed separately for each @xmath3 .",
    "however , once @xmath17 is fixed , the centrality dependence of the multiplicity , as well as its dependence on the collision energy , is a prediction of the model .",

    "as can be seen from the figure , the centrality dependence of the flow coefficients at the lhc can be described by many different temperature dependencies of the viscosity .",
