    "blazars are among the most powerful accelerators of relativistic particles in nature , as shown by egret observations of 100 mev - gev emission from over 60 fsrqs and bl lac objects .",
    "consequently , blazars represent a potential source of high - energy neutrinos ( see gaisser et al .",
    "1995 and halzen 2001 for reviews ) .",
    "the bright , highly variable @xmath2 radiation from blazars argues for the existence of emission regions with high photon energy densities and intense nonthermal particle populations , which are needed for efficient photomeson production ( e.g. , mannheim and biermann 1992 ; mannheim et al.2001 ) .",
    "previous papers have considered internal synchrotron photons as targets for high - energy proton interactions ( e.g. , mannheim 1993 ) .",
    "here we show that uv photons from external radiation fields , which have earlier been proposed as a target photon source for nonthermal electrons to produce compton - scattered gamma - rays ( e.g. , dermer and schlickeiser 1993 ; sikora et al .",
    "1994 ) , also provide the most important photon source for photomeson production of @xmath3 tev neutrinos in fsrqs .",
    "we use the measured spectral fluxes and variability time scales of synchrotron and compton radiation from the blazar 3c 279 to determine physical parameters of its gamma - ray emission region .",
    "lower limits to the doppler factor @xmath4 are defined by the condition that the emitting region be transparent to gamma rays .",
    "equipartition arguments and observed fluxes of the synchrotron and compton components are used to determine the magnetic field strength @xmath5 in the plasma blob . assuming efficient acceleration of power - law energetic protons to a maximum energy limited by the magnetic field and size scale of the region",
    ", we calculate spectral emissivities of pion decay neutrinos formed through photomeson production . because the properties of the external radiation field are independent of the bulk lorentz factor @xmath6 of the radiating region , neutrino emissivity calculations using duty cycle estimates give accurate neutrino flux estimates during low @xmath2-ray states .",
    "we predict detectable fluxes of neutrinos from @xmath2-ray loud fsrqs using km@xmath0 neutrino telescope arrays such as icecube .",
    "the comoving synchrotron photon energy density is given by @xmath7 @xmath8@xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the observed bolometric synchrotron luminosity , @xmath11 is the comoving radius of the blob , here assumed spherical , and primes denote comoving quantities .",

    ", we consider the regime where the quasi - isotropic scattered external radiation field dominates the direct disk radiation field ( dermer and schlickeiser 1994 ) .",
    "if the @xmath2-rays are due to external compton - scattered radiation , then @xmath14 ( sikora 1997 ; dermer , sturner , and schlickeiser 1997 ) . combining these two expressions",
    "gives @xmath15@xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18",
    "@xmath19 when viewing within the beam of the jet ( @xmath20 ) . consequently @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 , where @xmath24 the energy of the external photons in the comoving frame is @xmath25 .",
    "models taking into account ssc and external compton ( ec ) components show that a complete spectral fit requires synchrotron , ssc and ec components ( bttcher 1999 ; hartman et al .",
    "thus @xmath26 - 1 for bl lac objects and @xmath27 - 10 for fsrqs .    the spectral energy density @xmath28 of the photons in the blob frame is given in terms of the @xmath29 flux @xmath30 through the relation @xmath31 where we relate the measured variability time scale @xmath32 to the blob radius @xmath11 through the expression @xmath33 @xmath34",
    ", @xmath35 is the observed variability time scale in days , and @xmath36 is the redshift .",
    "the expression @xmath37 relates the photon energies measured in the source and observer frames .",
    "the magnetic field in the blob can be estimated by noting that the total soft photon energy density @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the total compton power .",
    "hence @xmath40 .",
    "using the earlier expressions for @xmath41 and @xmath11 gives @xmath42    an independent estimate for @xmath5 can also be made by introducing the equipartition parameter @xmath43 for the ratio of nonthermal electron to magnetic energy densities in the jet .",
    "thus @xmath44 corresponds to equipartition , though with electrons only . for the measured synchrotron flux density @xmath45 with @xmath46 at @xmath47 , this gives @xmath48^{2/7}\\;{\\nu_{12}^{1/7 } d_{28}^{4/7}[s({\\rm jy})]^{2/7}(1+z)^{5/7}\\over \\eta^{2/7}[t_{\\rm var}({\\rm d})]^{6/7}\\delta^{13/7}}\\ ; \\label{beq}\\ ] ] in gauss , where @xmath49 is the flux density measured at @xmath50 hz .      transparency to @xmath51 pair - production attenuation requires that @xmath52 , which can be rewritten as a lower limit on @xmath4 using equation ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "energy losses of relativistic protons ( and neutrons ) are calculated on the basis of standard expressions ( see , e.g. , berezinskii and grigoreva 1988 ) for the cooling time of relativistic protons due to photopion production in @xmath53 collisions .",
    "if the ambient photons have spectral density @xmath54 , then @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the proton lorentz factor , @xmath57 is the photon energy in the proton rest frame , @xmath58 is the photopion production cross - section , @xmath59 is the threshold energy for the parent photon in the proton rest frame , and @xmath60 is the inelasticity of the interaction .",
    "the latter increases from @xmath61 at energies not very far above threshold where the single pion production channels dominate , to @xmath62 at larger values of @xmath57 where multi - pion production dominates ( e.g. see berezinskii and grigoreva 1988 , mcke et al .",

    "the results of our calculations in this simplified approach are found to give good agreement with earlier calculations ( berezinskii and grigoreva 1988 ) . in particular",
    ", the time scales for photopion interactions of ultra - relativistic cosmic rays with the cmbr are accurately reproduced ( see also stanev et al .",
    "this approach also works well for a broad power - law distribution of field photons @xmath73 for different photon spectral indices @xmath74 , and readily explains the significant increase in the mean inelasticity of incident protons ( or neutrons ) from @xmath75 for steep photon spectra @xmath76 with @xmath77 , to @xmath78 for hard spectra with @xmath79 ( mcke et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "calculations of the spectra of secondary particles and photons ( @xmath80 ) are done in the @xmath4-function approximation , assuming that the probabilities for producing pions of different charges ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) are equal for the multi - pion interaction channel . to correctly apply the @xmath4-function approximation",
    ", one has to properly take into account the different inelasticities of the multi - pion and single - pion production channels , which could explain the statement of mcke et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the @xmath4-function approximation does not work well in the case of hard photon spectra .",
    "we consider 3c 279 as a prototype fsrq .",
    "the broad - band radiation spectra produced by the relativistic ejecta in the jet of 3c 279 is generally thought to consist of a low energy synchrotron component and high energy compton component . in 3c 279",
    ", the synchrotron component dominates at observed frequencies @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath85 hz synchrotron emission is cospatially located with the gamma - ray production region .",
    "this assumption is supported by observations of correlated variability between the synchrotron and compton components in some bl lac objects and fsrqs .",
    "the high - energy compton emission consists of an ssc component and an external compton ( ec ) component due to target photons that originate from outside the jet ; for example from the disk , torus , scattered - disk radiation , reflected synchrotron radiation , etc .    for calculations of @xmath86 from 3c 279 ,",
    "we approximate the differential photon flux @xmath87 observed during the powerful flare of 1996 ( wehrle et al .",
    "1998 ) in the form of a continuous broken power - law function , with power - law photon indices @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 at frequencies @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 , respectively . the @xmath29 energy flux @xmath94 of the synchrotron radiation reaches a maximum value of @xmath95 at @xmath96 .",
    "the maximum flux of the compton component is @xmath97 times larger than the peak synchrotron flux during the flare , and is reached at @xmath98 .",
    "we suppose that the ssc component makes a substantial contribution to the hard x - ray emission in 3c 279 ( hartman et al .",
    "2001 ) , and therefore that @xmath99 .",
    "the redshift of 3c 279 is @xmath100 , and its luminosity distance is @xmath101 for an @xmath102 , @xmath103 cosmology with a hubble constant of 65 km s@xmath104 mpc@xmath104 .",

    "thus @xmath107 corresponds to the minimum doppler - factor required for relativistic blobs in 3c 279 to become transparent to absorption of the observed gev photons in the radiation field inside the blob .    expressing @xmath11 via the observed variability timescale @xmath108 1 - 2 days as observed by egret ( wehrle et al .",

    "the estimation of @xmath5 from equation ( [ b ] ) gives @xmath117 , using @xmath118 ergs s@xmath104 , @xmath119 , and @xmath99 .",

    "we assume that the spectrum of the external uv radiation field arises from a shakura / sunyaev ( 1973 ) optically - thick accretion disk model that is scattered by broad - line region clouds .",
    "this disk model has flux density @xmath123 up to a maximum photon energy @xmath124 determined by the innermost radius of the blackbody disk and properties of the central engine .",
    "we take @xmath125 ev ( dermer and schlickeiser 1993 ) . the energy density of the external radiation in the comoving plasma blob frame can be determined by noting that @xmath126 corresponds to the ratio @xmath127 of the directional external compton and synchrotron powers as measured along the jet axis .    , assuming 3 different doppler - factors for the jet : @xmath128 ( solid curve ) , @xmath129 ( dashed curve ) , and @xmath130 ( dot - dashed curve ) .",

    "the total injection power of the protons @xmath140 ergs s@xmath104 .",
    "note that @xmath141 s@xmath104 is the characteristic _ apparent _ luminosity of the flares detected by egret from 3c  279 . in calculations of @xmath142",
    "we take into account the photohadron interaction energy losses , as well as the escape losses of the protons in the bohm diffusion limit .",
    "this limit is more restrictive than the condition that the gyroradius of the highest energies of accelerated protons should not exceed the blob size ( hillas 1984 ) .",
    "3 shows the expected energy fluxes of the neutrinos produced by protons in fig .  2 .",
    "for the fluxes in fig .  3 , the total number of neutrinos that could be detected by a @xmath143 detector during 2 weeks of the flare , using neutrino detection efficiencies given by @xcite is 0.19 , 0.12 and 0.05 for the cases of @xmath144 , 10 and 15 , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that if the external uv field is neglected , these numbers would be significantly reduced .",
    "we calculate the number of neutrinos that would be detected by a km@xmath0 array ranging from @xmath145 to @xmath146 for the fluxes in fig .  3 , which would not leave a realistic prospect for the detection of at least 2 - 3 neutrinos , which is required for a positive detection of a source .",
    "bl lac objects , which have weak broad line regions and , therefore , a weak scattered external radiation field , should consequently be much weaker neutrino sources .",
    "because the properties of the external radiation field are insensitive to the value of the blob lorentz factor , neutrino production in the quiescent state can be accurately estimated on the basis of properties of the external radiation field derived during the flaring state .",
    "for a typical duty factor of the flares @xmath147 1 - 2 months per year , and considering the additional neutrino production during the quiescent phase , we can reasonably expect that icecube or other km@xmath0 array may detect several neutrinos per year from 3c 279-type blazar jets with @xmath148 .",
    "allowing for the possibility that the nonthermal protons may have an overall power larger than that for primary electrons improves the prospects for neutrino detection .",
    "it is important to notice that the external photon field reduces very significantly the characteristic energy of protons for effective photopion production , compared with the case of the internal synchrotron radiation field .",
    "in fact , acceleration of protons only to @xmath149 is required for efficient neutrino production through photomeson interactions , as can be seen from fig.1 .",
    "this effect permits us to predict that a km@xmath0 array will detect high - energy neutrinos from fsrqs without requiring acceleration of protons to ultra - high energies @xmath150 .",
    "( solid curve ) @xmath151 ( dashed curve ) , and @xmath152 ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
