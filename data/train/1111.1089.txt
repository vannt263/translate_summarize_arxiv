    "the phase transition temperature decreases with pressure increase such that it reaches zero value at some critical pressure @xmath0 . at some pressure interval below @xmath0",
    "the ordered ferromagnetic moment disappears discontinuously .",
    "thus at high pressures and low temperatures the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states are divided by the first order type transition whereas at higher temperatures and lower pressures this transition is of the second order .",
    "such type of behavior is typical for mnsi [ 1 - 4 ] , itinerant ferromagnet - superconductor uge@xmath1 [ 5,6 ] ( see fig.1 ) , zrzn@xmath1 [ 7 ] .",
    "the same behavior has been established in the ferromagnetic compounds co(si@xmath2se@xmath3)@xmath1 [ 8 ] and ( sr@xmath2ca@xmath3)ruo@xmath4 [ 4 ] where the role of governing parameter plays the concentration of se and ca correspondingly . also , there was demonstrated clear evidence for the first order nature of the ferromagnetic transitions in typical ferromagnets like ni , fe and co [ 9 ] .     the schematic phase + diagram of uge@xmath1 ref .

    ", width=288 ]    here we discuss the magneto - elastic mechanism of development of the first order type instability .",
    "actually the mean field treatment of the magneto - elastic mechanism has been put forward in the paper [ 11 ] where it was demonstrated that the change of transition character from the second to the first order takes place at strong enough steepness of the exchange interaction dependence on interatomic distance and large compressibility .",
    "it can be considered in frame of the landau theory of the phase transition .",
    "namely , in neglect the shear deformation the free energy density near the phase transition to the ising type ferromagnet has the following form @xmath5 here , @xmath6 is the magnetization density , @xmath7 is the relative volume change , @xmath8 is the bulk modulus .",
    "the coefficient @xmath9 is related to the curie temperature pressure dependence as @xmath10 in stress absence @xmath11 , the deformation is determined by square of magnetization @xmath12 that yields @xmath13 hence , at @xmath14 the phase transition changes its character from the second to the first order .",
    "this inequality can be rewritten through the measurable parameters as @xmath15 where we used the formula @xmath16 for the specific heat jump at phase transition of the second order .",
    "the magneto - elastic interaction also produces another general mechanism for instability of second order phase transition toward to the discontinuous formation of ferromagnetic state from the paramagnetic one . for the first time it was pointed out by o. k. rice",
    "[ 12 ] who has demonstrated that at small enough distance from the volume dependent critical temperature @xmath17 , where the specific heat @xmath18 @xmath19 , tends to infinity due to the critical fluctuations , the system bulk modulus @xmath20 , expressed through the free energy density @xmath21 starts to be negative @xmath22 that contradicts to thermodynamic stability of the system . in reality , before there will be reached the temperature corresponding to @xmath23 the system undergoes the first order transition , such that to jump over the instability region directly in the ferromagnetic state with finite magnetization and related to it striction deformation .",
    "this transition is similar to the jump over the region with @xmath24 on the van der waals isotherm at the liquid - gas transition .",
    "the condition of the first order instability ( 5 ) can be written in similar to eqn.(4 ) form @xmath25 however , unlike to eq .",
    "( 4 ) this formula demonstrates that the first order instability is inevitable due to infinite increase of fluctuation specific heat .",
    "thus , if in the system with the fixed volume the phase transition is of the second order with the infinite increase of specific heat then the effect of finite compressibility under assumption that the critical temperature is the volume dependent parameter transforms it into the phase transition of the first order . in reality , the striction interaction can change the shape of the free energy singularity in respect to its form in incompressible case .",
    "more elaborate treatment [ 13 ] taking into account this effect leads to the following condition of the first order instability @xmath26 here the function @xmath27 determines the fluctuation part of free energy @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the shear modulus . usually , the left hand side in eqn .",
    "( 6 ) is quite small and the transition of the first order occurs at temperature @xmath30 close to the critical temperature where fluctuation specific heat is large enough .",
    "it means that the temperature difference @xmath31 is smaller than the critical temperature @xmath32 by many orders . the latent heat at this transition @xmath33 proves to be extremely small .",
    "so , the first order phase transition is practically indistinguishable from the second order one and called weak first order phase transition or the phase transition of the first order closed to the second order .    according to eqs ( 4 ) ,",
    "( 6 ) the magneto - elastic mechanism effectively leads to the first order transition when the critical temperature is strongly pressure dependent .",
    "this is the case in all mentioned above materials . to check the criteria ( 4 ) , ( 6 )",
    "one must calculate the mean field jump and fluctuation part of the specific heat near the curie temperature for each given material . to be concrete , here",
    ", i ll do these calculations for uge@xmath1 characterized by strong magnetic anisotropy and by the precipitous drop of the critical temperature at pressure increase near 14 - 15 kbar [ 14 ] .",
    "uge@xmath1 is orthorhombic crystal with ferromagnetic order at ambient pressure found below @xmath34 .",
    "magnetic measurements reveal a very strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy [ 15 ] with @xmath35 being the easy axis .",
    "we shall denote it as @xmath36 direction .",
    "the free energy of strongly anisotropic ferromagnet can be written in terms of one component scalar order parameter corresponding to magnetization density @xmath37 along @xmath36 axis . in",
    "that follows we shall omit the order parameter index z. @xmath38 here , @xmath39 , the gradient terms are written taking into account the orthorhombic anisotropy @xmath40 where the @xmath41 are directions of the spin axes pinned to @xmath42 crystallographic directions correspondingly . the last nonlocal term in eq .",
    "( 7 ) corresponds to magnetostatic energy [ 16,17 ] @xmath43 , where internal magnetic field @xmath44 expressed in terms of magnetization density by means of maxwell equations @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "we shall use the following estimations for the coefficients in the landau free energy functional @xmath47    here , @xmath48 is the magnetic moment per uranium atom at zero temperature [ 18 ] , @xmath49 is the density of uranium atoms , which can be approximately taken equal to inverse cube of the nearest - neighbor uranium atoms separation @xmath50 angstrom [ 19 ] .",
    "the mean field magnetization and the jump of specific heat are @xmath51 the experimentally found specific heat jump @xmath52 per uranium atom [ 19 ] is in remarkable correspondence with eq.(12 ) .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of noninteracting field of the order parameter fluctuations is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding free energy and the specific heat are [ 20 ] @xmath55 @xmath56 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] proceeding to spherical coordinates and performing integration over modulus @xmath57 we come to @xmath58 here , @xmath59 . at critical temperature @xmath60 and the integral diverges .",
    "hence , performing integration over @xmath61 with logarithmic accuracy we obtain @xmath62 where @xmath63    the used condition @xmath64 at @xmath65 is realized at @xmath66 in view of roughness of the parameter estimation the region of logarithmic increase of specific heat can be in fact broader .",
    "the calculation taking into account the interaction of fluctuations has been performed by larkin and khmelnitskii [ 21 ] . in our notations",
    "the expression for the fluctuation specific heat at const pressure obtained in this paper is @xmath67 here @xmath68 is the effective constant of interaction . using the eqs .",
    "( 8)-(10 ) one can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ khm ] ) as @xmath69    so , we see that the order parameter fluctuations give rise the increase of specific heat near the critical point .",
    "the power of the logarithm @xmath70 is quite slow function slightly exceeding unity , hence in the temperature region given by inequality ( 18 ) one may estimate the fluctuation specific heat as @xmath71 we see that the fluctuation specific heat is smaller than the mean field jump given by eqn .",
    "( 12 ) . hence to check the first order phase transition instability in uge@xmath1 one",
    "must to proceed with criterium ( 4 ) .",
    "the curie temperature in uge@xmath1 falls monotonically with increasing pressure from 53 k at ambient pressure and drops precipitously above 15 kbar [ 14 ] .",
    "the average value of the critical temperature derivative can be estimated as @xmath72 for the bulk modulus we have @xmath73 where we have substituted typical sound velocity @xmath74 and used known [ 22 ] density value @xmath75 .",
    "thus , we have for the combination eq.(4 )    @xmath76    at @xmath77 the pressure derivative of the critical temperature is much higher ( and its square is even more higher ) than its average value given by eq . ( 22 ) .",
    "so , we come to conclusion that at critical temperature of the order 10 k the criterium ( 4 ) is fulfilled and the phase transition of the second order turns into the first order one .",
    "the magneto - elastic interaction provides development of the first order instability at the phase transition to the ordered state in a ferromagnet . however , actual temperature interval of this instability development is negligibly small and the first order transition looks almost indistinguishable from the second order one .",
    "the particular feature of anisotropic ferromagnet uge@xmath1 is the precipitous drop of the curie temperature as the function of pressure near 14 - 15 kbar . due to this property at about these pressures the second order phase transition ( or very weak transition of the first order ) to ferromagnet state turns into the real first order type transition .    at low temperatures according to the nernst law and the clausius - clapeyron relation",
    "@xmath78 the drop of transition temperature with pressure begins to be infinitely fast .",
    "it means that weak first order transition has the tendency to be stronger and stronger as temperature decreases .",
    "hence , the effect of magneto - elastic interaction or , more generally , of the order parameter interaction with elastic degrees of freedom at arbitrary type of ordering raises the doubts upon the existence of quantum critical phenomena .",
    "this work was partly supported by the grant sinus of agence nationale de la recherche ."
