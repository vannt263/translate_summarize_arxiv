    "one of the goals for doing computer simulations is the production of information useful in the interpretation and design of experiments .",
    "notwithstanding important issues regarding hamiltonian selection and parameterization , the interface of simulations with experiment is particularly challenging for quantum systems . the current monte carlo algorithms , whether they impose quantum particle statistics constraints or not , are performed either in real - time @xmath0 or in imaginary - time ( euclidean time ) @xmath1 . in real - time , the propagator @xmath2 for a system , described by a hamiltonian @xmath3 , oscillates wildly at long - times .",
    "analytically , these rapid oscillations self - cancel , but a monte carlo process , as it is typically used , has difficulty achieving this cancellation . as a consequence , modifications of the basic algorithms have been proposed to extend the simulations as long as possible in the real - time domain @xcite . with these new algorithms ,",
    "simulations typically produce dynamics extending to 2 to 3 times the natural periods of the systems . in imaginary - time , the propagator @xmath4 is diffusive and the rapid oscillations are avoided .",
    "correlations functions @xmath5 , however , are now a function of imaginary - time , and such functions do not easily convey the actual dynamics of the system . in principle , real - time correlation ( green s ) functions @xmath6 can be obtained from the imaginary - time ones by the process of analytic continuation . in practice , this process is difficult because it is ill - posed and because the monte carlo data is incomplete and noisy .",
    "recently , procedures were proposed to perform this analytic continuation @xcite .",
    "these procedures draw heavily upon methods of bayesian statistical inference and the principle of maximum entropy to infer from imaginary - time correlation functions their associated spectral densities @xmath7 . through linear - response theory ,",
    "the spectral densities represent the spectra associated with numerous real - time measurements of current - current , spin - spin , etc.correlations functions .",
    "what apparently has not yet been tried is performing the hilbert transform of these spectral densities to obtain the frequency - dependent retarded correlation function and then fourier transforming this quantity to obtain the real - time correlation function . in this paper",
    ", we will carry out these additional steps . by doing this ,",
    "we hope to gain a greater understanding of the physical content present in the spectral density returned by the bayesian methods .",
    "we expected that the resultant real - time information would be limited by the approximate and probabilistic nature of the analytic continuation methods .",
    "we found , however , that the distance in real - time over which our results are valid is limited primarily by the ability of the simulation algorithm to produce good data . to interface profitably with the numerical analytic continuation ,",
    "the simulation algorithm has to produce high quality data consistent with the assumptions of procedures .",
    "the algorithm we used had problems doing this , and we will describe the measures taken to reduce this difficulty .",
    "even so , in most cases we were able to extend in real - time up to factor of 10 natural periods of the physical systems .",
    "longer extensions are possible and require longer monte carlo runs . for present purposes , we had no physical motivation to do so .    in section  ii",
    ", we will discuss the various models studied .",
    "we simulated a particle moving in single harmonic and double - well anharmonic potential and a collection of particles moving in chains of these potentials .",
    "for these models we know the exact solutions . by calculating their properties numerically ,",
    "we can benchmark our methods . certain properties of a single double - well potential , like the tunnel splitting , are easily obtained numerically . the phase diagram for a chain of such oscillators",
    "is also known @xcite .",
    "this type of chain can exist in a symmetric or displacive state . in section  iii ,",
    "we summarize the numerical analytic continuation procedure we used and discuss our simulation technique . modifying the simulation technique to be more naturally ergodic and to produce data with short statistical auto - correlation times was the most difficult and restrictive part of our study .",

    "we simulated five hamiltonians .",
    "one was that for a single harmonic oscillator @xmath8 which has the natural frequency @xmath9 .",
    "another was that for a chain of @xmath10 such oscillators @xmath11 fourier transforming the displacements @xmath12 and momenta @xmath13 , we can of course rewrite this second hamiltonian as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this form",
    ", the hamiltonian is explicitly expressed as a collection on @xmath10 independent simple oscillators .",
    "the natural frequency of an oscillator is @xmath17 .",
    "the third hamiltonian was a variant of the harmonic chain @xmath18 which after fourier transforming the displacements becomes @xmath14 where @xmath19 . in this form ,",
    "the hamiltonian is again explicitly expressed as a collection on @xmath10 independent simple oscillators but with a dispersion relation that has a non - zero frequency at @xmath20 .",
    "the two other hamiltonians were a single , symmetric , double - well potential @xmath21 which has well bottoms at @xmath22 and a barrier height of unity at @xmath23 , and a chain of such potentials @xmath24 in the chain , @xmath25 sets the barrier height of every double - well . in both chains we assumed periodic boundary conditions and disallowed particle exchange .    for these hamiltonians ,",
    "our simulations obtained estimates of the imaginary - time displacement - displacement green s function @xmath26 here , the angular brackets denote thermal averaging .",

    "when these states lie below the barrier , and particularly for deep wells , they group into widely - separated , nearly degenerate pairs . the separation in energies within and between pairs",

    "roughly , @xmath25 is a measure of the barrier height relative to the frequency of inter - site oscillation and the frequency of oscillation associated with the well - bottom .",
    "when the barrier height is large , the particles collectively are displaced to the left or the right of their classical equilibrium positions in a broken symmetry state characterized by a non - zero value of the mean - squared displacement .",
    "as the barrier height is lowered , a critical value is reached where because of zero - point motion and tunneling , the particles collectively make a transition to a state where the mean - squared displacement of each is zero . accordingly , a simulation of the chain , done in one of these two thermodynamic phases , is expected to exhibit different quantum characteristics in the spectral density .",

    "the molecular dynamics method globally updates all the displacements and is a computationally efficient procedure .",
    "the monte carlo procedure maintains detailed balance to ensure proper equilibrium averages and filters out the results of `` bad '' integrations .",
    "we found , however , that this simple form of the hybrid method was inadequate for present purposes .",
    "the output of our simulation is to be used as input to maximum entropy procedures to execute the analytic continuation .",
    "as we will discuss below , the analytic continuation problem is an ill - posed problem and hence is very sensitive to the size of the errors associated with the input data . for a fixed amount of computer time ,",
    "reducing the size of the error efficiently by a monte carlo method requires shortening the auto - correlation times between measurements . in our computed green s function , in spite of small estimates for the error bars , we would often see small ( within the error bars ) unphysical sawtooth - like structure in regions about @xmath74 .",
    "following a simple procedure suggested by neal @xcite , we could generally remove this structure and also be more ergodic .",
    "his suggestion was after each monte carlo decision to reverse the direction of the molecular time integration , i.e. , @xmath75 , with probability @xmath76 .",
    "a smaller improvement is achieved by not using a fixed length for the time integration in the molecular dynamics simulation but rather to choose the length randomly from the interval @xmath77 where @xmath69 and @xmath78 are chosen so the monte carlo acceptance rate is in the 90 to 95 per cent range .",

    "adjusting the monte carlo acceptance rate is not the entire story .",
    "first , it seems best to insure @xmath69 is several times larger than the natural period associated with the slowest significant modes in the systems and then choose @xmath78 to fix the acceptance ratio .",
    "we remark that fahy and hamann @xcite observed for the standard hybrid method the existence of a critical time @xmath79 ( dependent of model parameters ) demarking non - ergodic and chaotic behavior in the results of the time integration . for a harmonic system",
    ", @xmath79 is infinite which suggests the inapplicability of the method to a harmonic system .",
    "we observed the behavior they found but whether @xmath69 was larger or smaller than @xmath79 had only small consequences on our measured results .",
    "as we illustrate below , we achieved very accurate results for the harmonic models .",

    ", we show the displacement - displacement green s function @xmath5 , for a single harmonic oscillator , obtained by evaluating ( [ eq : gvstau ] ) for various values of @xmath137 , as a function of the imaginary - time variable @xmath54 .",
    "these curves look similar to the green s functions that we obtained numerically for this and the other models : for some parameters and temperatures , the @xmath5 varies little as a function of @xmath54 ; for others , it varies rapidly at the ends of the interval @xmath138 and is flat in the middle with values nearly equal to zero ; and for still other parameters , it has a featureless , parabolic looking shape .",
    "the common features of these curves have several significant implications for the analytic continuation problem .",
    "first , we remark that from the quantum monte carlo simulations we obtain estimates of @xmath5 only at a relatively small number of discrete values @xmath139 .",
    "the smoothness of the curves implies that the @xmath140 at neighboring values of @xmath139 are correlated .",
    "the computation of the covariance matrix in ( [ eq : least - square ] ) is thus an important part of the of the analysis of the data .",
    "while the correlations among the different @xmath54 values of @xmath5 make the interpretation of the assignment of an `` error - bar '' to a given @xmath54 value delicate , such an assignment illustrates several difficulties inherent in the data that help to make the analytic continuation of the data often very difficult . in the case where @xmath5 is nearly flat ,",
    "the errors bars mean that a number of values of @xmath5 are `` within the error - bars '' of each other .",
    "this situation , along with the correlations implied by sizable off - diagonal elements of the covariance matrix , means that only a subset , and often a small subset , of the measured values of @xmath5 represent independent data useful for the analytic continuation procedure .",
    "the analytic continuation near the classical limit can be very difficult .",
    "the situation with the rapid end - point variation and the flat nearly zero values is another difficult case .",
    "again the flat region generates a lose of useful values of @xmath5 and the smallness of @xmath5 in this region can engender situations where the error bars would imply that during the simulation estimates of @xmath5 , which must be non - negative , were derived from ensemble values that included negative ones .",
    "the monte carlo algorithms in fact do not produce negative values but do produce highly skewed fluctuations about the mean .",
    "the gaussian assumption for the likelihood function in ( [ eq : likelihood ] ) thus can only be approached in the limits of a large number of independent measurements when the central limit controls the data distribution .",
    "the ratio of the mean value to the estimated variance ( signal to noise ratio ) also indicates that the most effective data comes from those in the rapidly decreasing region . at low temperatures ,",
    "the analytic continuation problem can become very difficult .",
    "the details of the simulation algorithm can also impact the quality of the results and data . in fig .  3",
    ", we show @xmath141 as a function of @xmath54 obtained by two closely related simulation techniques for a single harmonic oscillator .",
    "we remark that the scale of abscissa is @xmath142 of that of fig .  2 and the ordinate shows @xmath54 only in a narrow region at the symmetry point @xmath143 .",
    "the dashed curve is the analytic result obtained from ( [ eq : gvstau ] ) .",
    "the data is represented by square markers were obtained by the hpimc method without the time - reversed step ; the data represented by the circles were obtained with the hpimc method with the time - reversed step . in each case , the same number of monte carlo steps were made .",
    "one sees that the fluctuations with the hpimc method without the time - reversed step are larger and that the error bars associated with the results suggest a dip into non - negative values of @xmath5 .",
    "more significantly , the results deviate from the exact curve by more than one standard deviation in the immediate vicinity of @xmath144 .",
    "the analytic continuation result for @xmath7 from the data partially shown in fig .",
    "3 is shown in fig .",
    "4 . from ( [ eq :",
    "avsomega ] ) , the spectral density should be @xmath145",
    ". the solid curve is obtained from the hpimc algorithm and shows a broadened delta - function at the right location with nearly the correct weight .",
    "the fraction of a per - cent difference from the correct weight is most likely a consequence of the small error caused by discretizing the imaginary - time derivatives . on the other hand ,",
    "the dashed curve , which is obtained from the data obtained from the hipmc algorithm without the time - reversed step , is broader , located incorrectly , and has a larger discrepancy in its weight .",
    "the increased breadth is a consequence of the larger variance in the measured data .",
    "the incorrect location and poorer weight is a consequence of the small deviation from the exact value near @xmath144 , which in turn is a consequence of the monte carlo algorithm performing badly .    in fig .  5 , with the data obtained from the hpimc algorithm , we show the full analytic continuation form @xmath5 to @xmath146 . in fig .  5a , the data ( open circle )",
    "is compared with the exact results for @xmath5 ( solid line ) obtained from ( [ eq : gvstau ] ) . in fig .",
    "5b , the dashed curve is the @xmath7 obtained by the analytic continuation procedure , while the solid line is a lorentzian at the same location .",
    "the real part of @xmath147 is shown in fig .  5c , where the dashed line is the quantum monte carlo results and the solid line is an analytic result obtained from the lorentzian from fig .  5c .",
    "the width @xmath148 of the lorentzian shown in fig .",
    "5b was adjusted so the @xmath85 values of the two curves agreed .",
    "the single adjustment produced remarkably good agreement at high frequencies .",
    "the principal differences between the two curves are at @xmath149 where divergences should exist as indicated by ( [ eq : gvsomega ] ) .",
    "finally , @xmath146 is shown in fig .",
    "the solid line was obtained analytically and used the lorentzian of fig .  5b , while the dashed line is the quantum monte carlo result .",
    "the agreement between the results is satisfying and comparable in quality to that possible by real - time quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "the width of the lorentzian was @xmath150 , i.e. , about 7 times the natural period of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "this width is still controlled by the size of the variance in the measured values of @xmath5 .    for the case of the harmonic chain , we computed the green s function @xmath27 for each independent wave number and from it found the corresponding spectral density @xmath30 .",
    "as with the single oscillator , this function should be a delta - function located at @xmath17 and have a weight equal to @xmath151 .",
    "as in the single oscillator case , instead of finding a delta - function , we found a lorentzian - like peak at the correct location with the correct weight .",
    "the peaks for different values of @xmath81 , however , had different widths .",
    "in general , the peak widths increased with increasing @xmath81 , correlating with the increased variance associated with the @xmath27 .",
    "the spectral densities for the three lowest values of @xmath81 are shown in fig .",
    "the peak positions as a function of @xmath86 give the phonon dispersion relation .",
    "our determination of this relation is compared to the exact result in fig .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "there is a difficulty that must be mentioned . at @xmath20 and @xmath152 , @xmath27 is flat and the weight of the peak approaches infinity . for @xmath20 ,",
    "not surprisingly , we were unable to do the analytic continuation .",
    "this situation is why we considered the model defined by ( [ eq : model3 ] ) . here , @xmath17 at @xmath20",
    "is not zero and the determination of @xmath30 , and subsequently @xmath17 , is possible for all values of @xmath81 .",
    "the dispersion relation found from the analytic continuation agrees very well with exact result .",
    "for a single , double - well potential , the spectral density can give direct information about tunneling processes .",
    "this situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "8 where the spectral densities for the hamiltonian , described by ( [ eq : model4 ] ) , are shown for several different values of the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "it is straightforward to discretize schroedinger s time - independent differential equation for this potential and find the eigenvalues of the resulting eigenvalue equation .",
    "we adjusted the model parameters so only a very few ( usually one ) of the lowest eigenstate lied below the barrier height , similar to the situation depicted in fig .",
    "( for deeper wells , our simulation methods would get stuck in one well or the other for large numbers of monte carlo steps , and hence the algorithm effectively lost ergodicity . ) in the cases reported , the temperatures of the simulations were also less than the separation between the two lowest lying pairs of eigenstates .",
    "thus , our spectral densities only exhibited the transition between these two states , and the position of the peak gives a direct measure of the lowest frequency tunnel splitting .",
    "this position agreed very well with the exact value calculated from schroedinger s equation .",
    "additionally , the weight of the peak also agreed well with the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) .    for a chain of double - well potentials ( [ eq : model5 ] ) ,",
    "still a different situation presents itself . at zero temperature ,",
    "depending on the values of @xmath25 and @xmath43 , the system exists in either a broken symmetry phase , in which the mean - squared displacement is non - zero , or in a symmetric phase , in which the mean - squared displacement is zero .",
    "the model has a quantum phase transition .",
    "we found that simulation , if performed in the broken symmetry phase , stuck in one well or the other for large numbers of monte carlo steps , making it difficult to collect the amount of statistically independent information to do the analytic continuation . in fig .",
    "9 , we report the @xmath30 for two simulations done in the symmetric phase .",
    "the one in fig .",
    "9b is close to the zero - temperature phase boundary .",
    "as one moves closer to the @xmath153 phase boundary by increasing @xmath25 , the @xmath20 peak moves towards @xmath85 .",
    "this movement is a consequence of the decreasing probability for tunneling between the two minima of the double - well potential as the barrier height is increased .",
    "we used methods of bayesian statistical inference and the principle of maximum entropy to analytically continue imaginary - time green s function generated in quantum monte carlo simulations to obtain the real - time displacement - displacement green s functions . for test problems , we considered chains of harmonic and anharmonic oscillators whose properties we simulated by a hybrid path - integral quantum monte carlo method ( hpimc ) . from the imaginary - time , displacement - displacement green s function , we first obtained its spectral density . for harmonic oscillators",
    ", we demonstrated that the peaks of this function were in the correct position and their area satisfied a sum rule .",
    "additionally , as a function of wavenumber , the peak positions followed the correct dispersion relation . for a double - well oscillator , we demonstrated the peak location correctly predicted the tunnel splitting . transforming the spectral densities to real - time green s functions ,",
    "we conclude that we can predict the real - time dynamics for length of times corresponding to 5 to 10 times the natural period of the model .",
    "the length of time was limited by the simulation algorithm and not directly by the analytic continuation procedure .",
    "the simulation algorithm influences the results in at least two ways .",
    "one way is the ease with which statistically independent , gaussian - distributed data is obtained . in our experience , of the various quantum monte carlo methods we have used , path - integral monte carlo methods ( pimc )",
    "tend to produce data with long - ranged correlations , thus making statistical independence sometimes difficult to achieve .",
    "achieving statistical independence is important for proper error estimation because of the sensitivity of ill - posed problems to errors in the data . with out statistical indepence these error are usually underestimated . that the data is gaussian - distributed is necessary to satisfy the assumptions of the analytic continuation procedure .",
    "currently , large amounts of data are used to force the simulation data to have proper statistical properties .",
    "the method of binned averages @xcite , with many measurements in a bin , is used to achieve statistical independence .",
    "the central limit theorem is used to obtain a gaussian distribution of the binned averages . because of the low computational intensity necessary for the test cases considers ,",
    "producing the necessary large amounts of data was not problematic .",
    "a second way the algorithm can influence the results is through broken ergodicity and unphysical results . here",
    ", we are referring to the ragged structure we saw in @xmath5 with the hybrid method and to the small systematic difference between the exact and computed results .",
    "we have not previously seen similar problems .",
    "small modifications in the simulation algorithm removed the problems but it was at first difficult to determine the source of the difficulty . because the purpose of the research was not algorithmic development , we did not do any comparisons of hpimc and other possible methods to determine relative efficiency and other merits .",
    "again , the computation times for these simulations is small ( a few hours on a modest workstation ) and so we were unmotivated to make such comparisons .",
    "other recently suggested approaches , e.g. , @xcite , should be considered as part of further studies .    in general , we believe we have demonstrated that analytically continuing imaginary - time correlation functions , obtained from a quantum monte carlo simulation , to obtain real - time correlation functions is a feasible alternative to obtaining such real - time functions directly from a quantum monte carlo simulation done in real - time .",
    "one advantage in choosing this approach appears to be the longer length of time over which the real - time information is faithful to the correct result . of course",
    ", this conclusion is based on one study of simple models ; however , this study does strongly indicate the direction for further and more extensive work .",
