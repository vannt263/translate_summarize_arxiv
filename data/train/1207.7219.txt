    "the idea of mobile ad - hoc networks ( manets )  spontaneous wireless networks , operating without a backbone infrastructure , whose users / nodes relay packets for each other in order to enable multihop communications  continues to inspire practitioners and poses interesting theoretical questions regarding its performance capabilities .",
    "vehicular ad - hoc networks ( vanets ) may well be currently one of the most promising incarnations of manets .",
    "promoters of vanets believe that these networks will both increase safety on the road and provide value - added services .",
    "numerous challenging problems must however be solved in oder to be able to propose these services e.g. efficient and robust physical layers , reliable and flexible medium access protocols , routing schemes and optimized applications .",
    "an almost ubiquitous stochastic assumption in the theoretical studies of these problems in manets is that the nodes of the network are distributed ( at any given time ) as points of a planar ( 2d ) poisson point process . in conjunction with the aloha medium access ( mac ) scheme",
    " simpler but less efficient than csma usually considered in this context by practitioners  2d poisson manet models allow for quite explicit evaluation of several performance metrics ; cf .",
    "section  [ s.rw ] .",
    "however , they mostly regard local ( one - hop ) transmissions .",
    "in fact , introducing routing even to the simplest 2d poisson - aloha model is very difficult and it is hard to obtain rigorous theoretical results regarding truly multihop performances of manets ;  cf . again section  [ s.rw ] .",
    "one reason for this is that , while the source - node can be considered as a typical node in the manet and the powerful palm theory of point process can be used in the analysis of the first hop , further relay nodes on a given path ( traced by the dijkstra algorithm or any reasonable local routing on a 2d poisson manet ) can not be seen as typical nodes of the manet .",
    "in fact , the route followed by a packet is a random subset of the manet s point pattern ( depending on the routing algorithm ) and the typical point `` seen '' by the packet on a long route is not the typical point of the whole manet in the sense of palm theory , cf _ routing paradox _ in  @xcite .      in order to overcome this impasse and to propose an analytically tractable multihop model , in this paper we propose to `` decouple '' a tagged route from the remaining ( external to the route ) part of the manet .",
    "more precisely , we consider two stochastically independent point patterns to model respectively : some given route on which packets of a tagged flow are relayed and nodes which are only sources of interference for packet transmissions on this route",
    ".   moreover , we assume that the tagged route is modeled by a linear ( 1d ) stationary point process .",
    "these assumptions allow us to distinguish the typical node of the route from the typical point of the manet , and appropriately use palm theory to manipulate the two objects .",
    "the advantage of the 1d - modeling of the tagged route is that packets relayed on it through the nearest neighbor transmissions `` see '' , at any relaying node , the typical ( 1d palm ) distribution of the whole route .",
    "this is a well - known _ point - shift invariance property of the palm distribution in 1d _ , which does not have a natural extension in higher dimensions .",
    "another advantage of our decoupling of the two parts of the manet is that we can go beyond poisson assumptions in both of them .",
    "specifically , we will also consider a _",
    "poisson route appended with a lattice structure of relaying nodes _ , which turns out to be crucial to improve the routing performance on long routes in the presence of external interference and/or noise . regarding external interference",
    ", we are able to study the impact of the clustering of nodes , considering e.g. _ poisson - line manet _ ( to be explained in what follows ) .    before describing our main results , let us further justify our route - in - manet model .",
    "firstly , it is a quite natural scenario in vanets , where vehicles are randomly located on a road and subject to external sources of interference . in the context of a general 2d manet ,",
    "the linearity ( 1d - pattern ) of routing is clearly a simplification . in this case",
    "we think of packets as being relayed in a given direction , e.g. in a strip as shown on the left sketch in figure  [ fig.lineproj ] .",
    "we can approximate the `` real '' route by a `` virtual '' one by taking the orthogonal projections of the real nodes on the line joining the source and the destination .",
    "such a situation represents an approximation of a geographic routing .",
    "last but not least , in this paper we consider a 2d _ poisson - line manet _ model , in which all the nodes are randomly located on a ( background ) poisson process of lines , and form the so - called _ doubly - stochastic poisson process _ ( or cox process ) see on the right in figure  [ fig.lineproj ] . in this case",
    "our decoupled , tagged route is rigorously ( in the sense of palm theory ) the typical route in this poisson - line manet .",
    "we consider slotted aloha mac to be used both by the nodes of the tagged route and of the interfering part of the manet and the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) capture / outage condition , with the power - law path loss model and rayleigh fading .",
    "we assume that all the nodes of the manet are backlogged , i.e. , they always have packets in their buffers to transmit . moreover , we are interested in the routing performance of a tagged packet relayed by successive nodes on the route with priority in all queues on the route ( cf . a discussion of these assumptions in section  [ s.rw ] ) .",
    "the main results of this paper are the following :    * in the absence of external ( to the route ) noise and interference we evaluate the _ mean local delay _ on the poisson route , i.e. the expected number of time slots required for the packet to be transmitted by the typical node of the route to its nearest neighbor in a given direction .",
    "the inverse of this delay is intrinsically related to the _ speed of the packet progression on asymptotically infinite routes _ , which can also be related to the _ route transport capacity _ ( number of bit - meters pumped per unit length of the route ) .",
    "* the local mean delay is minimized ( equivalently , the progression speed is maximized ) at a unique value of the aloha medium access probability  @xmath0 . moreover , the routing is unstable  the delay is infinite ( the speed is null )  for @xmath0 larger than some critical value .",
    "this observation is fully compliant with the phase - transition phenomenon of the mean local delay discovered in the 2d poisson manet model in  @xcite .",
    "* we evaluate the _ mean end - to - end delay _ of the packet routing between two given nodes of the route .",
    "it shows a cut - off phenomenon , namely that _ routing on distances shorter than some critical value is very inefficient in terms of exploiting the route transport capacity_. * next , we study the impact of noise and external interference on our previous observations . confirming the theoretical findings of  @xcite in 2d poisson manets , we observe that the routing on a poisson route over long distances is unfeasible : _ the speed of packet progression on such routes is null _ due to the existence of large hops in random ( poisson ) paths . evaluating the end - to - end delay on finite distances with noise , we identify another , double cut - off phenomenon : the existence of _ critical values of end - to - end distance and noise power , beyond which the speed of packet progression is close to  0 _ , again making the routing inefficient in terms of exploiting its transport capacity . * in order to allow efficient routing over long routes one can complete the poisson route with a fixed lattice of ( equidistant ) relaying nodes . for this model , we evaluate the mean local delay and show how the route transport - capacity can be maximized by an optimal choice of the inter - relay distance of the lattice structure .",
    "* we explicitly evaluate the poisson - line manet model and compare it to that in the ( basic ) poisson - line - in - poisson - field model .",
    "we show that the poisson - line exhibits a larger coverage probability but also a larger end - to - end delay .",
    "this confirms previous general observations regarding the impact of clustering in interference ;  @xcite . *",
    "regarding applications to vanets , we evaluated delays of some emergency and broadcast communications .",
    "local ( one - hop ) characteristics in 2d poisson manets , such as sinr outage probability , the related density of packet progress , mean local delay and many others , have been extensively studied in the literature ; cf .",
    "e.g. among others  @xcite .",
    "poisson models also allow one to discover some intrinsic theoretical limitations of manets , regarding e.g. the scaling of the capacity of dense and/or extended networks  @xcite , or the speed of packet progression on long routes  @xcite .    in",
    "@xcite the authors study delay and throughput in a model with multihop transmissions with relays which are placed equidistantly on the source - destination line .",
    "the model is very similar to ours but with the following differences . in the model presented in  @xcite",
    "the topology of relaying nodes is regular ( they are equidistant ) and the pattern on interferers is re - sampled at each slot .",
    "the delays include both the service times and waiting times in the buffers on the given route . a combined tdma / aloha mac protocol with intra - route tdma and inter - route aloha is employed .",
    "in contrast , we use simple aloha , ignore queueing , and focus on the performance issues caused by the _ randomness of the topology of relaying nodes_. we are interested in intrinsic limitations of the performance of _ long - distance routing _ in wireless networks with an irregular topology .",
    "we believe that the observed limitations remain valid for networks employing csma .",
    "this is because they primarily depend on the existence of ( arbitrarily ) long hops .",
    "csma , which copes better with interference , can not improve upon this situation .",
    "in contrast , we show that using a regular structure of relay nodes superposed with irregular manet routes leads to better performance .",
    "this solution is also evidently necessary for the stability of queuing processes ( not covered in our paper ) .    _",
    "the remaining part of this paper _ is organized as follows . in section  [ s.linearnearest ] ,",
    "we present our nearest neighbor routing model with slotted aloha . in section  [ s.deterministic ]",
    "we compute routing delays in deterministic networks . in section  [ s.endtoend ]",
    "we study the end - to - end delays on a poisson route when the interference is limited to the interfering nodes on the poisson route . in section  [ s.noise ]",
    "we study the impact of external noise and interference .",
    "section  [ s.conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "let us denote by @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , the locations of nodes participating in the routing of some _ tagged flow of packets _ from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "this route is assumed not to change on the time scale considered in this paper .",
    "the following assumptions regarding @xmath5 will be considered .",
    "although it is not the main scenario of this paper , we begin by considering a deterministic , fixed , finite pattern of nodes @xmath6 .      in this scenario",
    "we suppose that @xmath7 forms a poisson point process of intensity @xmath8 , on the line @xmath9 . in this model",
    "the notational convention is such that @xmath10 and packets are sent by any given node @xmath3 to its nearest - to - the - right neighbor @xmath4 .",
    "note that the poisson assumption means that the 1-hop distances @xmath11 are independent ( across @xmath12 ) exponential random variables with some given mean  @xmath13 .",
    "we will call this scenario _",
    "nearest neighbor ( nn ) routing on poisson line_. we will also consider a version of this model , where the packet is transmitted to the _ nearest ( available ) receiver ( nr ) _ to the right on @xmath5 . this is an opportunistic routing allowing for longer hops , as will be explained in section  [ ss.nnvsnr ] .      in this model ,",
    "the tagged route consists of a superposition @xmath14 , where the poisson route @xmath15 is completed with equidistantly located `` fixed '' relay nodes @xmath16 ; @xmath17 is some fixed parameter and @xmath18 is a uniform random variable on @xmath19 , independent of @xmath15 , making @xmath5 stationary . in this model",
    "we also consider nn routing , i.e. , packets are always transmitted to the nearest neighbor to the right in @xmath5 .",
    "we consider @xmath5 as some `` tagged '' route obtained in a manet by some routing mechanism . a simple way of extending @xmath5 to a 2d manet model consists in embedding @xmath5 in an external field of nodes @xmath20 , on the plane @xmath21 .",
    "when doing so we will always consider that @xmath5 and @xmath22 are independent .",
    "the following assumptions regarding @xmath22 will be considered .",
    "one may consider a _ fixed , deterministic _",
    "pattern @xmath20 , although , once again , it is not the main scenario considered in this paper .      in this model ,",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is a poisson point process of some given intensity @xmath23 on @xmath21 .",
    "the poisson linear route @xmath7 embedded in a poisson process of interferers will be our default _ poisson - line - in - poisson field _ model .",
    "we will also consider a case where the interferers are located on a _ poisson process of lines _ ( roads ) on @xmath21 of rate @xmath24 representing the total line - length per unit of surface .",
    "assuming that on each line of this process there is an independent poisson process of points of intensity @xmath25 nodes per unit of line length , we obtain a doubly stochastic poisson point process on @xmath21 with intensity @xmath26 nodes per unit of surface ; see  @xcite",
    ". in particular , assuming @xmath27 , one can rigorously consider the poisson liner route @xmath7 embedded in such a poisson line process of interferers , as the typical route of the _ poisson - line manet _ , see figure  [ fig.lineproj ] on the right - hand side .",
    "we assume that the _ all _ nodes of @xmath5 and @xmath22 try to access the channel ( transmit packets ) according to the aloha scheme , in perfectly synchronized time slots @xmath28 .",
    "each node in each time slot independently tosses a coin with some bias for heads , which will be referred to as the _ aloha medium access probability _ ( aloha map ) .",
    "nodes whose outcome is heads transmit their packets , the others do not transmit .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the map of nodes in @xmath5 , and by @xmath29 the map of nodes in @xmath22 .",
    "the above situation will be modeled by marking the points @xmath30 with random , bernoulli , medium access indicators @xmath31 equal to 1 for the nodes which are allowed to emit in the slot @xmath32 and 0 for the nodes which are not allowed to emit .",
    "we have @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "when there is no ambiguity , we will skip the time index @xmath32 in the notation and also use the notation @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , we mark the interfering nodes by independent bernoulli , medium access indicators with parameter @xmath29 .    at each time slot @xmath32 ,",
    "aloha splits @xmath5 into two point processes",
    "@xmath36 of emitters ( having a mac indicator @xmath37 equal to 1 at time @xmath32 ) and ( potential ) receivers @xmath38 .",
    "it is known that when @xmath7 is a poisson process of intensity @xmath8 then @xmath39 and @xmath40 are independent poisson processes with intensity @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "each transmitting node uses the same transmission power , which without loss of generality is assumed to be equal to 1 .",
    "the signal - power path - loss is modeled by the power - law function @xmath43 where @xmath44 are some constants and @xmath45 is the distance between the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "signal - power is also perturbed by random fading @xmath46 which is independently sampled for each transmitter - receiver pair at each time slot @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the actual signal - power received at @xmath47 from @xmath48 at time @xmath32 is equal to @xmath49 . in this paper",
    "we will restrict ourselves to an important special case where @xmath46 is _ exponentially distributed _ , which corresponds to the situation of independent _ rayleigh fading_. by renormalization of @xmath50 ,",
    "if required , we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath46 has mean  1 .",
    "when a node located at @xmath48 transmits a signal to a node located at @xmath47 , then successful reception depends on the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the shot - noise process of @xmath53 : @xmath54 representing the interference created by the nodes of route @xmath5 and @xmath55 represents an external ( to @xmath5 ) noise .",
    "this external noise can be a constant ambient noise @xmath56 or a random field .",
    "in particular , @xmath55 may comprise the interference created by the external field of interferers @xmath22 , which do not belong to the route @xmath5 . in this case : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the subset of nodes of @xmath22 transmitting at time  @xmath32 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the common assumption throughout this paper is that the _ noise process @xmath55 is independent of the route - interference process @xmath59 _ and that _ the process @xmath55 is stationary in @xmath32_.    in this paper we assume a fixed bit - rate coding , i.e. , @xmath47 successfully receives the signal from @xmath48 if @xmath60 where @xmath61 is given by  ( [ sinr ] ) and @xmath62 is the sinr - threshold related to the bit - rate given some particular coding scheme .",
    "recall that in our nn routing model each transmitter in @xmath39 transmits to the nearest node on its right in @xmath5 , without knowing whether it is authorized to transmit at this time .",
    "successful reception requires that this selected node is _ not _",
    "authorized by aloha to transmit ( i.e. , it is in @xmath40 ) , and that the sinr condition  ( [ eq : sinr ] ) for this transmitter - receiver pair is satisfied .",
    "this corresponds to the usual separation of the routing and mac layers .",
    "in contrast , nr routing consists in transmitting to the nearest node ( in the given direction ) on @xmath5 _ which , at the given time slot , is not authorized by aloha to transmit_. the nr model hence might be seen as an opportunistic routing , which requires some interplay between mac and the routing layer . as we shall see , both routing schemes allow for quite explicit performance analysis in our basic poisson - line - in - poisson - field model .",
    "the default assumption in our numerical examples throughout the paper is @xmath63 nodes per meter in the poisson line model , i.e. the mean distance between two consecutive nodes on the line is 100  m. we will also use @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the fading @xmath46 is rayleigh , f is exponentially distributed of mean 1 , @xmath67 .",
    "unless otherwise specified , in this section we assume that the locations of _ _ the nodes in the network are known and fixed ( deterministic ) .",
    "the only source of randomness is aloha mac and independent rayleigh fading between any two given nodes . in what follows",
    "we present a simple computation which allows us to express coverage and routing delays in such networks .",
    "our observations will be useful in the remaining part of this paper , when we will study random routes in random manets .",
    "let us consider a transmitter located at @xmath68 communicating to a receiver located at @xmath69 in the presence of a field @xmath70 of interferers , with all nodes subject to aloha mac with map  @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that @xmath71 .",
    "we denote by @xmath72 the _ probability of successful transmission from @xmath48 to @xmath47 in one time slot_. this probability accounts for the likelihood of @xmath48 being authorized by aloha to transmit , @xmath47 not to being authorized to transmit and , given such circumstances , the probability of achieving the sinr larger than @xmath62 at the receiver .",
    "we define two functions : @xmath73 for reasons which will become clear in what follows , we call @xmath74 the _ interference factor _ and @xmath75 the _ noise factor_.    [ l.pi ] we have @xmath76    [ r.pi-recur ]",
    "let us note that @xmath77 satisfies the following recursion when adding an interferer @xmath78 to the field @xmath22 : @xmath79 in other words , the external noise reduces the probability of successful transmission over the distance @xmath45 by the factor @xmath80 , which in the absence of noise and interference is equal to @xmath81 ( because of the aloha scheme ) .",
    "moreover , adding an interfering node @xmath78 to @xmath22 causes a decrease in the successful transmission probability by the factor @xmath74 , where @xmath82 is the distance of the new interferer to the receiver .",
    "we have @xmath83\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath84 = ( 1-p)+p { { \\mathbf e}}\\big[e^{-tf_{(z , y ) } l(|x - y|)/l(|z - y|)}\\big ] = 1-\\frac{p}{\\frac1{t } \\frac{|z - y|^{\\beta}}{|x - y|^{\\beta}}+1}\\,,\\ ] ] where we use the assumption that @xmath46 is an exponential variable .",
    "the proof follows by induction .",
    "@xmath72 is the probability that node @xmath48 can successfully send a tagged packet to node @xmath47 in a single transmission .",
    "however , a single transmission is not sufficient in aloha . hence , after an unsuccessful transmission , the transmitter will try to retransmit the packet with aloha , possibly several times , until the packet s reception .",
    "we denote by @xmath85 the expected number of time slots required to successfully transmit a packet from @xmath48 to @xmath47 ( considering the previous scenario of @xmath68 transmitting to @xmath69 in the presence of a field @xmath70 of interferers ) . under our assumptions",
    "this number is a geometric random variable of parameter @xmath72 and hence its expected value is equal to : @xmath86 we call @xmath85 the _ local ( routing ) delay_. by lemma  [ l.pi ] @xmath87 and an analogous recurrence to this of remark  [ r.pi-recur ] holds for @xmath88 with the reciprocals of the noise and interference factors .      let us now consider a route consisting of nodes @xmath89 in the field of interfering nodes @xmath22 ( we assume that @xmath90 ) . the average delay to send a packet from @xmath91 to @xmath92 using the route @xmath5 is simply the sum of the local delays on successive hops @xmath93 note that for the hop from @xmath94 to @xmath95 other nodes of the route @xmath96 act as interferers .",
    "we call @xmath97 the _ ( routing ) delay _ on @xmath5 . using  ( [ e.l ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath98 we also denote by @xmath99 the mean speed of packet progression on the route @xmath5 .",
    "the above expressions allow for a relatively simple , explicit analysis of routing delays in fixed networks , i.e. in networks where the locations of the nodes are fixed and known . in the case when such information is not available , one adopts a stochastic - geometric approach averaging over possible geometric scenarios regarding @xmath5 and/or @xmath22 .",

    "we consider a typical node on the route @xmath5 , that is of the poisson point process @xmath15 . by the slivnyak theorem ,",
