    "a15 materials show a pronounced deviation of @xmath0 from the linear behavior at high temperature when the mean free path is expected to become comparable with the inter - atomic distance.@xcite however , both in cuprates and in alkali - doped fullerenes the theoretical prediction of the resistivity saturation at the ioffe - regel limit seems to fail.@xcite experimental measurements in lightly doped cuprates show a resistivity greater than the saturation value @xmath6 estimated by the simple quasi - particle picture,@xcite and also transport measurements in the alkali - doped compounds would predict at high temperatures a mean free path smaller than the intermolecular distance.@xcite    although these two classes of materials present significant differences , an interesting common trait which is shared by both families is the relevant role of a strong electronic correlation .",
    "the presence of strong correlation effects questions the simple drude - like picture based on the quasi - particle concept , and the above criterion for the resistivity saturation is needed to be revised in these materials . on the theoretical ground , the lack of resistivity saturation in cuprates and alkali - doped fullerenes",
    "has been recently investigated in details in refs . by means of the numerical quantum monte carlo and dynamical mean - field theory techniques . a simple analytical criterion , alternative to the ioffe - regel one ,",

    "the resistivity saturation is achieved when the electron scattering rate @xmath7 , inversely proportional to the electron lifetime @xmath8 , becomes comparable with the electron bandwidth @xmath9 . in this regime the quasi - particle concept is clearly meaningless , the drude peak is lost and the optical conductivity @xmath10 is almost structureless up to energies @xmath11 . by considering a general sum - rule ( sr)@xcite and an opportune model for the optical conductivity @xmath10 gunnarsson and co - workers @xcite estimated thus @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the electron kinetic energy .",

    "( [ gunmodel ] ) is quite general and specific material details , as the source of the electron scattering , are hidden in the evaluation of the electron quantities @xmath9 , @xmath13 . in cuprates for instance , due to the strong electronic correlation , the amount of charge carriers , and hence of the kinetic energy , is expected to be roughly proportional to the hole doping @xmath14 , namely @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the kinetic energy of the uncorrelated system .",
    "the limiting value of the resistivity saturation is thus expected to be significantly doping dependent @xmath17,@xcite and it could in particular account for the lack of saturation in the physical range of temperature of the low doping regime .",
    "aim of this paper is to investigate in a more analytical way the effect of the electronic correlation on the transport properties and on the saturation phenomenon .",
    "we note that both the ioffe - regel criterion ( @xmath18 ) and the simple model introduced by gunnarsson and coauthors ( @xmath19 ) do not rely on the microscopic nature on the electron scattering mechanism ( impurities , phonons ) or on the specific temperature dependence of it , but they are only related to the absolute magnitude of the scattering channels , parametrized by the quantity @xmath7 . in this perspective , in the following we consider an impurity scattering mechanism where the electrons are elastically scattered by dilute paramagnetic impurities .",
    "although the temperature dependence of the resistivity in this case is of course disregarded , this assumption is however sufficient to investigate the phenomenon of the resistivity saturation which , as mentioned above , depends only on the absolute value of @xmath20 more than on its temperature dependence . in our context",
    "the impurity scattering rate @xmath21 plays thus the role of ruling the intensity of the quasi - particle scattering , in the same way as the temperature acts within the electron - phonon framework . at a first level of approximation ,",
    "thus , our analysis as function of @xmath21 can shed a useful light on the temperature dependence in other scattering mechanisms once the dependence of @xmath21 on the temperature is known ( @xmath22 const . for impurities ,",
    "@xmath23 for electron - electron scattering , @xmath24 for the electron - phonon one at low temperatures ) .",
    "we introduce also an approximate expression for the one - particle green s function to take into account , in a self - consistent way , the interplay between the electronic correlation and the impurity scattering .",
    "this simple model permits to evaluate in an analytical way the effects of the electronic correlation on one - particle quantities as the quasi - particle scattering rate @xmath7 , the electron lifetime @xmath8 and the kinetic energy @xmath13 .",
    "we evaluate also the resistivity by using the kubo s formula , obtaining the behavior of the resistivity as a function of the correlation degree .",
    "we qualitatively confirm the results of refs .",
    "and we predict a significant difference , in the low doping highly correlated regime , between the quasi - particle lifetime as extracted for instance from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy and the apparent transport lifetime as extracted from resistivity measurements by using a simple drude - like formula .",
    "a paradigmatic model to discuss the strong electronic correlation effects in solid state physics is the hubbard model where propagating electrons described by bloch - like states strongly interact each other through a local repulsion . in the case of a single non degenerate band",

    "the chemical potential @xmath29 rules the electronic band filling @xmath30 . in the most interesting case close at half - filling ( @xmath31 ) , the complex physics of the hubbard model can be parametrized in terms of two energy scales : the kinetic energy , which scales with the electronic bandwidth @xmath9 , and the hubbard repulsion @xmath28 .",
    "the behavior of the system depends strictly on the ratio @xmath32 , where the @xmath33 regime describes a weakly correlated system with strong itinerant quasi - particle character , while in the @xmath34 limit the electronic states are almost totally localized .",
    "a standard way to describe electronic properties in interacting systems is by means of the green s function formalism in the context of the quantum field theory .",
    "single - particle properties are thus taken into account by green s function @xmath35 which describes the propagation of a one - particle electronic excitation with momentum @xmath36 and energy @xmath37 . from a generic point of view , the interacting green s function @xmath35 is usually described in terms of a _ coherent _ and an _ incoherent _",

    "physical properties are expected to be strongly dependent of the amount of the coherent and incoherent spectral weight .    in this paper",

    "this simple model was recently employed to study the reduction of the screening properties in strongly correlated systems , leading to a predominance of forward scattering , and its interplay with the nonadiabatic superconducting pairing.@xcite simple arguments to understand the reduction of the screening properties in correlated systems come from the fact that the metallic screening of charge fluctuations requires the momentum @xmath36 to be a good quantum number and it is mainly related to the coherent states . as we are going to see , similar argumentations hold true also for transport properties .    in the following we are going to employ the model described by eqs .",

    "as briefly mentioned in the introduction , a simple criterion for determining the value of the resistivity saturation @xmath6 in non correlated system was presented in ref . .",
    "in this analysis the resistivity saturation is achieved when the spread of the drude peak is of the same order of the bandwidth @xmath9 and the optical conductivity is described by a featureless structure up to the energy scale @xmath9 .",
    "a simple sum rule gives thus @xmath165 , where @xmath13 is the electronic kinetic energy .",
    "this model was also applied to strongly correlated systems , as the cuprates.@xcite in this case , assuming a bandwidth independent of the degree of correlation , the scaling of the kinetic energy with the number of the hole doping @xmath166 would predict an increase of the resistivity saturation value as @xmath167 , in agreement with the experiments . however , the assumption of a constant bandwidth @xmath9 independent of the electronic correlation is somehow questionable since the same coherent excitation which are involved in the drude - like peak are expected to probe a renormalized dispersion with the effective bandwidth @xmath88 .",
    "two different argumentations can be invoked for justifying both the employing of @xmath9 and of @xmath88 in this simple model .",
    "they depend respectively upon two different picture of the physics underlying . in the first case",
    "we assume that the coherent processes are dominant , and the loss of the drude peak is due to the broadening of the peak itself . in this case the bandwidth parameter is consistently given by @xmath88 and resistivity saturation is expected to be achieved when @xmath168 . in an alternative scenario we can imagine that a narrow drude - like peak is still present in the saturation regime , but with a vanishing spectral weight so that the dominant contribution to the optical conductivity is given by the incoherent scattering .",
    "a reasonable choice of the appropriate bandwidth parameter is thus @xmath9 .",
    "the consequences of the different choices are evident by considering that in the first case the scaling of the effective bandwidth itself with @xmath14 ( or @xmath42 ) would cancel the similar dependence of @xmath13 giving a value of @xmath6 independent of the electronic correlation , whereas only in the second case the scaling @xmath169 proposed in ref .",
    "would be operative .",
    "our model permits us to check on an analytic ground both pictures .",

    "the resistivity saturation is expected to appear when the incoherent contributions to the electrical conductivity become dominant with respect to the coherent one , and it is related to the regime @xmath193 .",
    "we have shown that in the first scenario the resistivity saturation value is essentially independent of the degree of electronic correlation , and it could not account for the experimental lack of saturation in the underdoped region of cuprates .",
    "on the other hand , the resistivity saturation is expected to scale in the second scenario with the reduced spectral weight @xmath42 due to the correlation effects , @xmath186 .",
    "this result is in a good agreement with recent experimental data by takenaka et al.,@xcite which nicely show the @xmath186 behaviour of the dc resistivity in the low doping region @xmath194 where the spectral weight @xmath42 itself is expected to scale with @xmath195 , @xmath196.@xcite similar results were also found by numerical calculation based on exact diagonalization technique.@xcite    the resulting phase diagram in the @xmath28-@xmath14 space for the relevance of the saturation effects is shown in fig .",

    "the label m indicates region where the conductivity is dominated by the coherent part and the system behaves like a strongly correlated metal but with metallic characteristics , while in the s region the incoherent contributions prevail and the saturation behaviour is expected . since the coherent and incoherent contributions to the conductivity scale in a different way with the bare impurity scattering rate @xmath198 , @xmath199 const .",
    ", the balance is strongly dependent on @xmath21 . in the main frame of fig .",
    "[ f - phase ] we show the phase diagram for a sizable scattering rate @xmath200 , where saturation effects extend up to @xmath201 in the correlated regime .",
    "the shadow area points out qualitatively the region where van hove singularity effects are expected in the two - dimensional tight - binding model appropriate for cuprates and where the constant dos model is expected to fail .",
    "the inset shows also the very weakly impurity case @xmath202 . in this case",
    "the coherent part is almost always dominant and strong correlation effects , for @xmath45 and @xmath203 where @xmath97 are needed in order to show saturation .",
    "we remind that in the generalization of the present analysis to the electron - phonon scattering mechanism , the scattering rate @xmath21 plays the role of the temperature dependent scattering rate , which can be easily of the order of the bandwidth @xmath204 for large enough temperatures .",
    "aim of this work has been to investigate electronic correlation effects on the quasi - particle and transport properties . a key role in this context",
    "is thought to be played by the reduction of the coherent spectral weight accompanied by the onset of localized state .",
    "for instance the lack of resistivity saturation at the mott - ioffe - regel limit in cuprates superconductors has been recently related to an effective renormalization of single - particle quantities , as the kinetic energy , due to the strong electronic correlation .",
    "although some analytical models based on a sum rule conservation have been proposed , the effects of the electronic correlation have been mainly studied by means of numerical approaches .    in this paper",
    "we have introduced a simple phenomenological model in order to describe in an analytical way the transfer of spectral weight from coherent to incoherent states as the degree of electronic correlation is increased .",
    "we have studied the interplay between electronic correlation and impurity scattering in quasi - particle and transport properties .",
    "we identify two different regimes , a low correlated regime , where the effective bandwidth of coherent states is much greater than the impurity scattering rate , and a highly correlated regime where the renormalization effects induced by the electronic correlation yield an effective coherent bandwidth @xmath105 smaller than the impurity scattering rate itself .",
    "contrary to what one should expect , correlation effects in this latter regime increase the quasi - particle life - time .",
    "we have also evaluated the electrical resistivity by means of the current - current response function . within the simple bubble approximation",
    ", we have shown that correlation effects enhance the resistivity @xmath20 ( suppress the conductivity @xmath145 ) according the scaling law @xmath205 in both low and highly correlated regimes .",
    "this results suggest that the ` phenomenological' quasi - particle and transport scattering rate , respectively @xmath7 and @xmath161 , as extracted by the experiment within a quasi - particle analysis , should scale in an opposite way upon the relevance of the electronic correlation .",
    "our analysis permits in addition to test in a direct way some predictions of a simple sum - rule model employed to describe the resistivity saturation limit .",
    "we found that the lack of resistivity saturation in cuprates can be interpreted as an effective enhancement of the saturation limit as correlation effects are increased approaching the half - filling case , in agreement with refs .",
