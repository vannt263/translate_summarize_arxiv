    "whereas dna conductivity is still disputed , there is no doubt that electron transfer through dna double strands takes place .",
    "@xcite it is generally believed that the electron or hole migrates by super - exchange tunneling or multistep hopping in a donor - bridge - acceptor system depending on the energy difference between the bridge and donor / acceptor @xcite and the fluctuation of the environment .",

    "the transfer is governed by thermal activation .",
    "the rate can be described in the non - adiabatic limit by the semi - classical marcus theory @xcite and is determined by the hopping integral @xmath1 , the energy difference between product and reactant states @xmath2 , the reorganization energy @xmath3 and the temperature @xmath4",
    ".    at low temperatures , however , the transfer rate does not vanish but rather remains finite and temperature independent : the transfer is governed by quantum fluctuations and involves nuclear tunneling.@xcite in this regime the transfer is modeled by an electronic two - level system@xcite coupled to a dissipative environment as in the spin - boson model@xcite which has to be treated quantum mechanically .",
    "one can identify three regions of dynamics depending on the coupling to the bosonic bath : coherent ( damped oscillations ) , incoherent ( exponential relaxation ) transfer and self - trapping .",
    "however , in many cases charge transfer involves multiple excess charges which are correlated .",
    "@xcite their transfer characteristics is changed drastically in comparison to the case of a single excess charge and requires a description by more than two states.@xcite two charges can migrate as pairs , sequentially or can be self - trapped .",
    "their dynamics are governed not only by the coupling to a dissipative bath but also by the local and non - local coulomb interactions ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively.)@xcite    in this paper we study the charge transfer dynamics of two electrons or two holes in different dna base - pair dimers based on guanine / cytosine ( gc ) or adenine / thymine ( at ) pairs .",
    "we have used the base - pair specific coulomb matrix elements as calculated with ab - initio methods.@xcite we assume that two charges are initially prepared on one base - pair monomer ( donor )  this could be achieved , e.g. , by voltage gating .",
    "then , the transfer of those two charges occurs either in a concerted manner , where an electron pair or hole pair is transferred between the donor ( d ) and the acceptor ( a ) , or both charges migrate sequentially but correlated .",
    "this transfer of the first electron facilitates or hinders the transfer of the second one due to the electronic correlations .",
    "we find that depending on the coulomb matrix elements a second charge can lead even to self - trapping or , in the other extreme , to partially activationless transfer .",
    "recently , conductance measurements of single dna molecules were performed in aqueous solution .",
    "@xcite the solution preserves the native confirmation and the transport properties can be associated with charge transfer reactions at least for weak coupling to the leads.@xcite at voltages equal to the on - site coulomb interaction we expect that more than one excess charge is relevant for the charge transport through a molecular device . consequently , the transport characteristics is altered considerably .",

    "@xcite    our detailed study of the base - pair specific transfer characteristics of multiple excess charges for realistic systems reveals the connection between the microscopic parameters and the transfer efficiency .",
    "previously , only an electronic model with density - density interactions coupled to an ohmic bath has been investigated.@xcite in this paper we extend the calculations to a more general electronic model which includes an additional bond - bond interaction ( pair - transfer ) @xmath0 previously neglected as well as a bond - charge interaction @xmath7 ( correlated hopping . )",
    "these matrix elements have been calculated for different dna base - pairs@xcite using ab - initio methods and serve as input for our calculations .",
    "we have found that the additional bond - bond interaction @xmath0 favors concerted electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor but can also lead to a change of the ground state of the dimer .",
    "the parameter @xmath0 has a profound impact on the ground state of the electronic subsystem with two excess charges : it lifts the degeneracy of singlet and the triplet state .",
    "the latter becomes the ground state for @xmath8 and a positive effective coulomb matrix element .",
    "since the hamiltonian considered here is spin - conserving , the system can only decay into an metastable steady state in this regime starting with two excess charges on the donor in a spin singlet state .",
    "another important application of charge transfer are dna biosensors . during the sensing process",
    ", electron transfer is used to produce electronic signals .",
    "@xcite in general the signal magnitude depends on the efficiency of the electron transfer through the dna as well as the number of electrons .",
    "it has been suggested that the transfer of multiple electrons would enhance those signals.@xcite however , our work shows that the transfer rate for a single electron in systems with two excess charges depends on the environment as well as the coulomb matrix elements : it may be much larger or much smaller than the transfer rate of a single excess charge depending on the microscopic parameters .    for temperatures lower than the activation energy the bath must be treated quantum - mechanically to calculate the time - dependent population probabilities and the transfer rates . in this regime",

    "[ fig_marcusw ] for @xmath165 .",
    "the dependency of the rate @xmath141 on @xmath0 obtained at low temperatures using the td - nrg follows the prediction of the marcus theory as shown in fig .",

    "as discussed above , the gc - gc ( 2h ) dimer is located in the inverted region as a consequence of the large @xmath166 .",
    "an increasing @xmath0 reduces the energy difference between the initial state and @xmath159 leading to an increase of @xmath141 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratew ] ( squares ) .",
    "the transfer in gc - gc ( 2e ) shows almost no dependence on @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_ratew ] , triangles ) since it is located in the activationless regime .",
    "an electron - pair in an at - at dimer remains self - trapped for @xmath167 in an ohmic bath . in a super - ohmic bath ( @xmath168 ) , however , coherent transfer is found at low temperatures .",
    "the electrons oscillate coherently as pairs between the donor and the acceptor while the high lying singlet covalent state @xmath159 is only virtually occupied .",
    "the oscillation frequency is approximately given by @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the renormalized pair - hopping in the presence of the bosonic bath : this frequency increases with increasing @xmath0 .",

    "note that the time scale is multiple orders of magnitude larger compared to the fs time - scales of the gc - gc dimer .",
    "the relaxation rate of the envelope function corresponds to a significantly longer time scale @xmath172 .",
    "we have calculated the real - time dynamics of a redox system with multiple charges . at temperatures lower than the activation energy we have used the time - dependent numerical renormalization group approach ; at temperatures larger than the activation energy when the transfer is governed by thermal activation we have employed the marcus theory .",
    "four different dna dimers have been considered : gc - gc and at - at with initially two excess electrons or holes on the donor site .",
    "all results are obtained for realistic matrix elements obtained by ab - initio methods.@xcite    the charge transfer characteristics of a system with two excess charges deviates substantially from those of a single excess charge .",
    "the transfer occurs correlated and depends strongly on diagonal and off - diagonal coulomb matrix elements .",
    "we predict that an additional charge in dna sensors or dna devices will show base - pair specific signal amplification or attenuation .",
    "we have calculated the rate @xmath141 that at least one charge is transferred from the donor to the acceptor .",
    "the time - dependent population probabilities of the singlet covalent state ( @xmath159 ) and two ionic states ( @xmath173 , @xmath174 ) depend on the difference between the effective diagonal coulomb interaction @xmath137 and the off - diagonal bond - bond interaction @xmath0 .",
    "we have found a qualitative agreement between the marcus theory a high - temperatures and the td - nrg at low temperatures .",

    "however , self - trapping is only found in the td - nrg .",
    "the correct application of the marcus theory requires the restriction to transitions compatible with spin - conservation : the triplet state @xmath42 remains inaccessible since we always start with two charges in a spin - singlet state on the donor .",
    "the maximal transfer rate @xmath141 , defining the activation - less regime , is significantly larger in the subspace of two excess charges compared to the subspace of a single excess charge . at low temperatures ,",
    "the largest rate is found for two excess electrons in gc - gc and for two excess - holes at room temperature .",
    "electron - pairs initially on the donor in an at - at dimer are either self - trapped ( ohmic bath ) or are slowly oscillating as pairs between d and a ( super - ohmic bath ) at low temperatures .",
    "the dependency of the transfer rate on a finite but small bond - bond interaction @xmath0 can be understood in terms of a simple shift of @xmath175 : the rate @xmath141 now peaks at @xmath176 .",
    "consequently , the transfer rate increases for two holes on gc - gc which is located in the inverted regime while @xmath141 decreases for two holes on at - at with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "it remains constant for two electrons on gc - gc since the rate appears to be rather insensitive to @xmath0 in the activation - less regime .",
    "furthermore , the presence of the additional bond - bond interaction @xmath0 splits the degeneracy of the singlet and the triplet state , @xmath159 and @xmath42 , respectively . without any further spin relaxation process",
    ", the system can not reach the electronic thermodynamic ground state @xmath42 for @xmath8 and @xmath177 since the triplet state remains unpopulated at all times .",
    "the system remains trapped in an intermediate metastable state whose life - time will depend on the spin relaxation mechanism not considered here .",
    "the transfer characteristics of two charges in a dna dimer depends strongly on the base pair specific coulomb interactions .",
    "these effects will become important when such redox systems are weakly contacted .",
    "they strongly influence the current - voltage characteristics once multiple excess charges are relevant at higher source - drain voltages.@xcite",
