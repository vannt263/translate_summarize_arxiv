    "throughout the history of quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) calculations of atomic properties ( notably , energy shifts ) , two approaches have mutually inspired each other , namely , the analytic and the numerical _ ansatz_. the necessity for employing both methods is easily seen when one considers the range of coupling constants @xmath1 which are relevant for hydrogenlike ions ( here , @xmath3 is the nuclear charge number , and @xmath4 is the fine - structure constant ) . for low @xmath3 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is very small , and an expansion of the fermionic propagators in powers of @xmath1 appears reasonable . for high @xmath3 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath1 approaches unity , and the mentioned expansion is not practical  @xcite .",
    "consequently , starting with the accurate investigations on the spectrum of highly charged ions  @xcite , there has been tremendous activity over the past few decades regarding the accurate description of energy levels of heavy ions .",
    "these are complemented by technically demanding experiments  @xcite .",
    "some of the most important effects to be considered in qed bound - state calculations are so - called self - energy corrections , where a bound electron spontaneously emits and reabsorbs a virtual photon . between the photon emission and absorption , other interactions  with the binding coulomb field and , possibly , with other external fields",
    " may occur .",
    "even for low-@xmath3 ions , a direct expansion of the electron propagators in powers of @xmath1 is not universally possible : namely , the energy of the virtual photon must be large enough ( larger than the scale of the atomic binding ) , so that the electron can essentially be regarded as a free particle in between the emission and absorption ( perturbed only by a finite number of interactions with the coulomb field ) .",
    "however , when the photon energy is small ( commensurate with the atomic binding energy ) , this expansion is no longer possible . in this case",
    ", the expansion in powers of @xmath1 is achieved `` implicitly , '' by observing that since the photon energy is so small , one may expand the currents at the photon emission and absorption vertices in the long - wavelength limit , i.e.  in terms of dipole interactions , quadrupole interactions , spin - dependent interactions etc .",
    "( see ref .",
    "the foldy  wouthuysen transformation  @xcite can be used in order to achieve a clear separation of the hamiltonian into a leading nonrelativistic term and relativistic corrections , and a decoupling of upper and lower components of the dirac wave function to a specified order in @xmath1 is achieved .",
    "this transformation , together with a careful matching procedure needed in order to `` join '' the high - and low - energy parts , then leads to the analytic results traditionally used in order to describe the lamb shift  @xcite and other effects such as the bound - electron @xmath9 factor  @xcite .",
    "the intricacies described above are responsible for the @xmath1 expansion not being a simple power expansion ( taylor series ) in @xmath1 .",
    "the matching of high - and low - energy contributions at an intermediate photon energy scale commensurate with an overlapping parameter @xmath10 leads to the appearance of logarithms of @xmath1 ( see also the illustrating example in appendix  a of  @xcite ) .",
    "the expansion thus is semi - analytic . for the lamb shift in hydrogenlike systems ,",
    "many terms have been calculated in the semi - analytic expansion  @xcite , but the numerical approach was faced with tremendous problems , and no direct result had been calculated for hydrogen ( @xmath11 ) up to the year 1999 . at low @xmath3 , the experimental accuracy is orders of magnitude higher than at high @xmath3 , and the comparison and the implied mutual consistency check of the numerical and analytic calculations is most meaningful .",
    "therefore , a calculation was carried out  @xcite which confirmed the consistency of both approaches and determined a nonperturbative remainder term which is beyond the sum of the known terms in the @xmath1 expansion .",
    "the nonperturbative remainder term amounts to roughly 28  khz for the hydrogen ground state lamb shift , which is a numerically large effect as compared to the current experimental accuracy of about 33  hz for the @xmath12@xmath13 transition  @xcite .",
    "similar calculations were done , and agreement of the analytic and numerical calculations was found , for @xmath0 states  @xcite .",
    "other effects studied both within the @xmath1 expansion and within the numerical approach include the bound - electron @xmath9 factor of a bound @xmath14 state  @xcite .",
    "also , the self - energy correction to the hyperfine structure ( hfs ) was extensively studied for the @xmath14 states during last decades , both within the numerical all - order approach @xcite and within the @xmath1 expansion @xcite .    for the hyperfine",
    "splitting of @xmath0 states , however , investigations of the self - energy corrections are much more scarce , both within the numerical as well as within the analytic approach .",
    "there are some quite recent all - order numerical calculations for the @xmath15 state @xcite as well as for the @xmath16 level  @xcite ( see also the latest paper  @xcite ) , but there are only few analytic results to compare to .",
    "if we denote the nonrelativistic fermi energy by @xmath17 , then the only known self - energy correction  @xcite is that of order @xmath18 .",
    "this correction amounts to @xmath19 for @xmath20 states and @xmath21 for @xmath22 states .",
    "because this correction is entirely due to the electron magnetic moment , we can refer to it as an anomalous magnetic moment correction to the hfs .    in this work , in the order to address the current , somewhat unsatisfactory status of theory",
    ", we calculate the self - energy correction to the hfs of @xmath0 states up to order @xmath23 .",
    "this correction goes beyond the anomalous magnetic moment correction and is due to numerous effects .",
    "indeed , the calculation constitutes quite a complicated problem , mainly for three reasons .",
    "first , the problem considered is a radiative correction under the influence of an additional external field , i.e. , we have three fields to consider ( the photon field , the coulomb field and the nuclear magnetic field ) .",
    "second , the angular algebra is much more complicated than for reference @xmath14 states  @xcite .",
    "the third difficulty is that for @xmath0 states , the nonrelativistic limit of the hyperfine interaction has to be treated much more carefully than for @xmath14 states .",
    "namely , we may anticipate that there exists a correction to the electron s transition current , caused by the hyperfine interaction , which contributes to the self - energy correction for @xmath0 states , but vanishes after angular integration for @xmath14 states .",
    "this correction to the current can be understood easily if one considers the coupling of the physical momentum @xmath24 of the electron to the vector potential of the quantized electromagnetic field [ here , @xmath25 is the vector potential corresponding to the hyperfine interaction defined below in eq .  ] .",
    "the correction to the current has not been considered in the previous investigations which dealt with @xmath14 states  @xcite .",
