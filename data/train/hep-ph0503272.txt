    "it is generally believed that there exists a rich phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature and baryon density , for instance , the deconfinement process from hadron gas to quark - gluon plasma , the transition from chiral symmetry breaking to the symmetry restoration@xcite , and the color superconductivity@xcite at low temperature but high baryon density .",
    "recently , the study on the qcd phase structure is extended to finite isospin density . the physical motivation to study qcd at finite isospin density and the corresponding pion superfluidity",
    "is related to the investigation of compact stars , isospin asymmetric nuclear matter and heavy ion collisions at intermediate energies . in early studies on dense nuclear matter and compact stars",
    ", it has been suggested that charged pions and even kaons are condensed at sufficiently high density@xcite .",
    "while the perturbation theory of qcd can well describe the properties of the new phases at high temperature and/or high density , the study on the phase structure at moderate ( baryon or / and isospin ) density depends on lattice qcd calculation and effective models with qcd symmetries . while there is not yet precise lattice result at finite baryon density due to the fermion sign problem@xcite , it is in principle no problem to do lattice simulation at finite isospin density@xcite .",
    "recently it is found that@xcite there is a phase transition from normal phase to pion superfluidity at a critical isospin chemical potential which is about the pion mass in the vacuum , @xmath1 . the qcd phase structure at finite isospin density is also investigated in many low energy effective models , such as chiral perturbation theory@xcite , nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model@xcite , random matrix method@xcite , ladder qcd@xcite , and strong coupling lattice qcd@xcite .",
    "one of the models that enables us to see directly how the dynamic mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration operate is the njl model@xcite applied to quarks@xcite .",
    "the chiral phase transition line@xcite in the temperature and baryon chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) plane calculated in the model is very close to the one obtained with lattice",
    "recently , this model is also used to investigate the color superconductivity at moderate baryon density@xcite .",
    "it is nature to extend the njl model to finite isospin chemical potential@xcite . in the frame of general njl lagrangian with @xmath3 breaking term@xcite , it is analytically proved@xcite at quark level that the critical isospin chemical potential for pion superfluidity is exactly the pion mass in the vacuum , @xmath4 , and this relation is independent of the model parameters , regularization scheme , @xmath3 breaking coupling , and color degrees of freedom @xmath5 .",
    "unlike the effective models at hadron level where one can study the effect of phase transitions on meson and diquark properties in mean field approximation , in the njl model applied to quarks , only the order parameters of the phase transitions , namely the condensates , can be described at mean field level , to study mesons and diquarks should go beyond the mean field approximation .",
    "it is well - known that@xcite in the mean field approximation to quarks together with random phase approximation ( rpa ) to mesons in the njl model , one can obtain the hadronic mass spectra and the static properties of mesons remarkably well , especially the goldstone mode corresponding to the chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking .",
    "however , in the pion superfluidity or the color superconductivity phase , the structure of the bubble summation in rpa is much more complicated than that in the chiral breaking phase .",
    "the correlation among the mesons and diquarks becomes very important and leads to the goldstone modes corresponding to the isospin and color symmetry spontaneous breaking . in this paper , we study analytically and numerically the pion superfluidity , its effect on the meson properties , and its possible competition with the color superconductivity and kaon condensation in the frame of standard njl model at finite temperature and baryon , isospin and strangeness chemical potentials .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] , we establish the mean field theory of the njl model at finite temperature and baryon and isospin densities . in section [ s3 ]",
    ", we study the pion superfluidity at zero temperature , zero baryon chemical potential , but finite isospin chemical potential , and calculate the chiral and pion condensates and thermodynamic functions . in section [ s4 ]",
    ", we study the temperature behavior of the pion superfluidity at zero baryon chemical potential and show the phase diagrams in the temperature and isospin chemical potential plane . in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we investigate the meson modes in both normal phase and superfluidity phase in rpa . in section [ s6 ] , the bosonized version of the @xmath6 njl model",
    "is discussed at finite isospin chemical potential with pion condensation . in section [ s7 ] , we study the baryon chemical potential effect and the competition between pion and diquark condensations . in section [ s8 ] , we briefly discuss the flavor @xmath7 njl model at finite isospin and strangeness chemical potentials including both pion and kaon condensations . we summarize in section [ s9 ] .",
    "the standard approach for dealing with the thermodynamics of a variable particles is via the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the key quantity for a system with baryon number conservation and isospin number conservation is the partition function defined by @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the volume of the system , @xmath11 the inverse temperature @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath8 are the baryon and isospin chemical potentials , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 the conserved baryon number and isospin number operators .",
    "if we take only quark field @xmath16 as elementary field of the system , the operators can be expressed as @xmath17 the factors @xmath18 and @xmath19 reflect the fact that @xmath5 quarks make a baryon and quark s isospin quantum number is @xmath19 . in the imaginary time formulism of finite temperature field theory ,",

    "the above lagrangian density has the symmetry @xmath36 corresponding to baryon number gauge symmetry , isospin symmetry and chiral symmetry , respectively .",
    "however , in the presence of a nonzero isospin chemical potential , the isospin symmetry @xmath37 breaks down to @xmath38 global symmetry which is related to bose - einstein condensation of charged pions , and the chiral symmetry @xmath39 breaks down to @xmath40 global symmetry which is associated with the chiral condensation of sigma meson .",
    "therefore , in the case with @xmath41 , chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature and chemical potentials means only degenerate of @xmath28 and @xmath42 meson masses . at zero baryon",
    "chemical potential , the  fermi surfaces \" of the @xmath43 and anti-@xmath44 quarks coincide . therefore , at sufficiently high @xmath45 the condensate of @xmath24 and anti-@xmath25 quarks is favored , and at sufficiently high @xmath46 the condensate of @xmath25 and anti-@xmath24 quarks is favored . since at low isospin chemical potential ( and low temperature and low baryon chemical potential ) there is no deconfinement , the condensates can be identified as bose - einstein condensates of charged pions , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . introducing the chiral condensate , @xmath49 and two pion condensates ,",
