    "the focus of observation is the interdependence of the critical values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 at which extinction occurs.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    need for the new experimental proposal that we present here arises from the fact that the stationary single mask experiment @xcite uses for its interpretation a number of inputs which suffer from a certain degree of uncertainty .",
    "some of these uncertainties are about the values of @xmath6 and @xmath4 @xcite , and others about the extent to which other phenomena such as signaling @xcite that occur in bacterial movement might affect the outcome of the experiment . because absolute values of critical lengths may be difficult to obtain with an acceptable degree of accuracy ,",
    "we propose here stationary mask observations , that focus , instead , on the _ interdependence of two critical lengths_. the essential feature of this present proposal is to have more than one mask in the petri dish , so that there are two controllable lengths , a favorable length associated with a livable region for the bacteria , and a hostile length associated with an unlivable region .",
    "the double control possible in the proposed experiment opens the prediction space from a single value to an infinity of values .",
    "the variation of the critical value of one of the lengths when the other is changed presents an entire _ relationship _ that is directly observable rather than a single value and therefore could lead to a much cleaner and trustworthy interpretation of the observations .    the simplest system to study consists of two masks , each of length @xmath14 , separated by a distance of length @xmath11 as shown in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "the previously investigated case with a single mask @xcite corresponds , obviously , to infinite @xmath13 . to test the idea behind the new proposal",
    ", we carried out numerical studies of the full nonlinear fisher equation ( [ fisher ] ) with given values of @xmath6 , @xmath4 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 ( 10 , 0.1 , -0.9 and 1 in appropriate units . )",
    "all lengths were expressed as ratios to the diffusion length @xmath15 .",
    "the numerical studies used an explicit finite differences scheme , @xmath1 being discretized in intervals of 0.1 .",
    "the convergence to a steady state was analyzed by measuring the distance between successive solutions .",
    "the result we found ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) is that the critical value of the mask width @xmath12 , i.e. , the smallest value that can support a non - zero bacterial population in the steady state , is lowered for a finite intermask distance @xmath13 .",
    "we considered 10 different values of the hostile length ( the intermask distance @xmath13 ) and varied the favorable length ( the mask width @xmath12 . ) for each @xmath12-@xmath13 pair , we started with arbitrary initial conditions and let the program run until no time dependence was discernible .     and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the former is the width of the mask and the @xmath11 is the distance between the two masks ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , both lengths being expressed in this plot in units of the diffusion length @xmath16 where @xmath4 is the growth rate under the masks . outside the masks @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath17 to represent the harsh effect of the ultraviolet light , the magnitude of @xmath9 being taken for the purposes of this plot to be 9 times that of @xmath4 .",
    "we solved eq .",
    "[ fisher ] numerically for various different values of the nonlinear parameter @xmath5 and found that the results did not depend on those values provided @xmath5 was non - zero and positive .",
    "the shaded region represents pairs of @xmath12 and @xmath13 values that lead to bacterial extinction in the steady state .",
    "filled circles mark the onset of extinction and are obtained from the numerical solution . the solid line constructed simply to smoothly join the circles ,",
    "is found to coincide precisely with the prediction of our analytic theory.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we repeated the procedure for each of several sufficiently low values of @xmath12 and increased @xmath12 until the extinction disappeared .",
    "we also reversed the procedure starting with high values of @xmath12 and decreased them systematically until extinction appeared .",
    "numerous runs allowed us to obtain corresponding pairs of @xmath12 and @xmath13 that mark the transition region .",
    "the results are denoted by filled circles in fig .",
    "the shaded area represents the extinction region and the unshaded area the parameter region in which bacterial population densities are non - zero in the steady state .",
    "the curve passing through the numerically found transition points may be considered , at this stage of our discussion , to be simply a smooth joining trace .",
    "we will see below that its exact shape can be accessed through our analytic theory .",
    "it is easy to understand , on the basis of a qualitative argument , the shape and tendency of the results of the numerical solutions of the nonlinear equation .",
    "bacteria diffuse from within the mask to the harsh region and die if they reach that region .",
    "small values of the mask width or large values of the intermask distance result in extinction .",
    "the extinction effect is worsened by an increase in the intermask distance for small values of that distance but the effect saturates for larger values .",
    "hence the saturation in the curve .",
    "all these features can be tested experimentally in our proposed set - up .",
    "quantitative comparison with the predictions of the fisher equation are possible because we have developed an exact analytic theory of the interplay of the favorable and hostile distances as reflected in the transition .",
    "what makes the proposed comparison with experiment significant is that , although the fisher equation , whose _ numerical _ solution has led us to set out the separation curve between the extinction region and the rest in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , can not be solved exactly by analytic means , the separation curve itself can be obtained analytically .",
    "indeed , we show below that the curve is given precisely by @xmath18\\right ] .",
    "\\label{analytic}\\ ] ] this prediction , which is one of the central analytic results of the present paper , coincides with the solid curve in fig .",
    "following the ideas of ludwig et al . @xcite but applying them to the many - mask system , we consider the steady state of the fisher equation ( [ fisher ] ) and argue that if there is a transition , the quadratic term in the steady state @xmath19 can be neglected at the extinction point in favor of the linear terms since @xmath19 itself vanishes at the transition .",
    "we are thus led to seek the solutions of @xmath20 under the two masks , and of @xmath21 outside the masks , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we take the masks to lie from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . using @xmath26 and @xmath27 as constants , the most general functions for @xmath19 inside and outside the mask , respectively ,",

    "both are fully expected and natural results .",
    "it is also instructive to rewrite the transition relation as @xmath36 where we express the favorable distance @xmath12 and hostile distance @xmath13 normalized to the growth diffusion length @xmath37 as @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , and the depletion parameter @xmath40 is the square root of the ratio of the destruction rate @xmath9 and the growth rate @xmath4 .     and the hostile length @xmath13 respectively from eq .",

    "the curve for @xmath45 from our theory is shown as the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and displays exact coincidence with the numerical findings . to be noted is the fact that the numerical solutions are of the full nonlinear equation and",
    "have ben found for a specific @xmath5 whereas the analytic theory is linear and does not require the use of a value of @xmath5 , requiring for its application only the condition @xmath46 .",
    "it is clear from our eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) that the variation of the destructive rate @xmath9 may also be employed for useful experimental exploration , at least in principle . while this could have also been done in the one - mask scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite , we explain the idea here in the two - mask case .",
    "additional confirmation of the theoretical picture of the dynamics of the bacteria might be provided by observing how the critical @xmath12-@xmath13 values change with the _ intensity _ of the ultraviolet light .",
    "even if we do not know the precise dependence of @xmath9 on the intensity , we can be fairly certain that it increases with the latter , and undergoes a saturation at high values of the intensity .",
    "a variation of the critical value of @xmath12 with the intensity would show therefore qualitative behavior similar to the variation with @xmath9 , equivalently with the ratio @xmath47 .",
    "the latter variation is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . with one exception ,",
    "all @xmath13 values produce the same saturation value of @xmath12 for large @xmath40 .",
    "the exception is @xmath48 : its saturation value is one half that of the others .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to the hyperbolic tangent becoming @xmath49 for all non - zero values of @xmath13 for large enough @xmath50 , but vanishing if @xmath13 vanishes .",
    "physically , this means that if there is an adverse region between the masks , bacteria will be killed on arriving there , in light of the infinitely harsh radiation , reducing the problem to a single - mask scenario with the given @xmath12 as the mask width . on the other hand , if the intermediate harsh region does not exist at all ( because @xmath48 ) , one is reduced to considering a _ single _ mask with width twice that of the given mask .    ) for the dependence of the critical value of @xmath12 on the intensity of ultraviolet radiation , represented here by the value of @xmath40 , for given values of the hostile length ( half the intermask separation ) @xmath51 as shown .",
    "all @xmath13 values produce the same saturation values of @xmath12 for infinitely harsh ultraviolet intensity except for @xmath48 : all curves reach the same higher value for large @xmath40 except the @xmath48 curve whose saturation value is one half that of the others .",
    "see text for explanation .",
    "the lengths are expressed as dimensionless ratios to the diffusion length @xmath15.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    our suggestion , thus , is to use both the relative variation of the favorable and hostile lengths , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and of the intensity of ultraviolet light in the manner discussed , to check our simple quantitative predictions .",
    "it is possible and useful to construct set - ups with _ multiple _",
    "masks for further experimental verification . the theory for this situation along the ludwig et al .",
    "arguments we have developed here is slightly more tedious to write down .",
    "for ease in notation , let us adopt as we have done in eq .",
    "( [ twodimless ] ) , the symbols @xmath52 and @xmath53 to express the favorable and hostile lengths in units of @xmath15 .",
    "then the linear petri dish formula for an even number of masks is obtained by executing the following pseudocode .",
    "let @xmath54 be an operator defined by the successive operations of ( i ) taking the hyperbolic tangent of what it acts on , ( ii ) multiplying the result by @xmath40 , ( iii ) taking the arctangent of the result , and ( iv ) subtracting the result from @xmath52 .",
    "define the operator @xmath55 similarly through the successive operations of ( i ) taking the trigonometric tangent of what it acts on , ( ii ) dividing the result by @xmath50 , ( iii ) taking the hyperbolic arctangent of the result , and ( iv ) subtracting the result from @xmath56.to obtain the required formula for an even number of masks , start with the product @xmath57 .",
    "apply @xmath54 and then @xmath55 alternately and successively so that there are as many @xmath54 s in the operation as the number of mask pairs in the system , but one more @xmath54 than @xmath55 .",
    "( thus , do @xmath54 for a pair of masks , @xmath58 for 4 masks , @xmath59 for 6 masks , and so on . ) finally , equate the result to the arctangent of @xmath40 to get an implicit formula showing the @xmath52-@xmath53 relation .",
    "the pseudocode can be expressed succinctly in terms of operators @xmath55 and @xmath54 by stating that the general expression for @xmath60 masks can be formally written as @xmath61 \\left(\\xi\\delta\\right)=\\arctan \\xi$ ] . as can be verified ,",
    "this reproduces the 2-mask formula , eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) .",
    "the 4-mask formula is    @xmath62",
    "our suggested set - up and calculations have taken the petri dish to have infinite extension away from the two masks , an assumption that should be reasonable in light of the destructive effects of the radiation .",
    "we now analyze another practical extension of the theory .",
    "consider the two - mask situation in a _",
    "circular _ petri dish , i.e. one in which the boundary conditions are periodic , the hostile distance between the edges of the masks being @xmath11 on one side as in the earlier analysis but now also @xmath63 on the other side , see fig .",
    "let the width of the dish be small enough so that bacterial diffusion can be considered to be still 1-dimensional but over a total distance of extent @xmath64 .",
    "we are not interested here in 2-dimensional considerations appropriate to wide dishes , an example of which may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for experiments with _ moving _ masks or rotating dishes .     as well as @xmath12 and @xmath13.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]",
    "we now have , as in the analysis given above , @xmath65 inside the right mask , i.e. , for @xmath29 , but to the right of the right mask , i.e. , for @xmath31 , @xmath19 is not proportional to @xmath66 as in the earlier analysis , but @xmath67 this expression , which , in the right region under consideration , where @xmath68 , can be written as @xmath69 , will hold on the left extreme as well but there it simplifies to @xmath70 .",
    "the additional phase @xmath71 is immediately determined from the periodicity in the boundary conditions , i.e. , by matching the logarithmic derivative of the solution at @xmath72 : @xmath73 matching also at @xmath24 and @xmath74 , one arrives at the new formula for critical @xmath12 and @xmath13 , valid for a _",
    "petri dish : @xmath75    we see that the circular dish result , eq .",
    "( [ circular ] ) , is symmetric in the two hostile lengths @xmath76 and @xmath13 as it obviously must be , that it reduces to the result for the linear dish of infinite extent , viz . , eq .",
    "( [ analytic ] ) , when @xmath76 becomes infinite since then the new hyperbolic tangent in eq .",
    "( [ circular ] ) reduces to @xmath49 , and that , when @xmath76 vanishes ( equivalently when @xmath13 vanishes ) , it yields a new expression for the critical width for the single - mask case but with twice the width value .",
    "if there were simply a single mask in a circular petri dish of extent @xmath76 and no @xmath13 , the generalization of the ludwig formula that would come out of our analysis would be @xmath77    most importantly , we see that it should be possible in principle to use the new analytic result(s ) for experimental probing of the phenomenon under consideration since one could construct and employ circular petri dishes of desirable radius .",
    "needless to say , the added effects discussed here would not be discernible for @xmath76 values that are very large as then bacteria would die in the external regions quickly enough .",
    "we have also derived the corresponding expressions combining circular dish geometry with the multiple mask set - ups .",
    "specifically , the 4-mask formula takes the form , @xmath78 being @xmath76 measured in units of @xmath15 , @xmath79 whose reduction to the linear dish formula is obvious as @xmath76 becomes infinite .",
    "we have verified all these expressions that we have derived , by comparing their predictions to numerical solutions of the fisher equation with explicit ( arbitrary ) non - zero @xmath5 s .",
    "the proposal for experimental observations of abrupt population transitions in patches that we have presented above should be of interest for multiple reasons .",
    "patches or spatial inhomogeneities have been studied and emphasized early on in ecology by many authors such as levin @xcite , murray @xcite and shigesada @xcite in varied contexts including traveling waves , and there have been recent contributions as well on the dirichlet conditions problem for general nonlinearity incorporating allee effects @xcite .    our analysis here provides a clean proposal for experiments which derives its potential for clear interpretation from the use of two ( or more ) controllable distances of travel , one favorable and the other unfavorable .",
    "one should be able to use it for extraction of parameter combinations in the fisher equation which has been ubiquitous in mathematical ecology .",
    "the idea behind the present proposal should therefore find use in systems other than bacterial aggregates .",
    "indeed , we have found similar abrupt transitions in _ infected _ rodent populations in our study of the hantavirus epidemic .",
    "the theory for that system is , however , more complex , and can not be developed without approximation .",
    "by contrast , the theory we have presented here is , perhaps surprisingly , exact , i.e. , analytical .",
    "this is so in spite of the fact that analytic solutions of the fisher equation for these situations do not seem to be possible except as elliptic quadratures .",
    "the reason for this happy state of affairs can be understood from the original arguments of ludwig et al . given in their paper on spatial patterning of the budworm @xcite , or from the lucid explanations given ,",
    "e.g. , in a recent text on mathematical ecology @xcite . at the transition ,",
    "the densities vanish and therefore terms of order higher than the first may be safely neglected .",
    "our theoretical contribution is only in generalizing that analysis to multiple masks and nonlinear geometries as shown .",
    "the observationable controllable features our proposal emphasizes , and directly utilizes , are ( i ) the interplay of the favorable and adverse lengths for bacterial traversal , ( ii ) the variation of the intensity of ultraviolet radiation which changes the interrelationship of the critical values , ( iii ) the multiple - mask set - up which reintroduces bacteria into favorable regions after they have passed into arid areas , and ( iv ) the optional use of circular geometry for the petri dish which provides one more controllable length .",
    "we are currently involved in investigating fluctuation effects that appear from detailed monte carlo considerations and become manifest for small population densities , in constructing the theory for transitions in partially infected populations of rodents in open terrains , in analyzing the effects of static disorder in the placement and size of the masks , and in studying the effects of dynamic ( time ) variation of mask size and placement as in ref @xcite .",
    "the bacterial experiments proposed above are , however , ready to go and we hope that observations will be made soon along the lines we have discussed .    this work was supported in part by the nsf under grant no .",
