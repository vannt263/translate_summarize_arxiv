    "quantum entanglement  non - classical correlations between parts of compound quantum system is one the most important topics of contemporary quantum theory , including quantum optics and quantum information @xcite .",
    "one of the methods for analysis of bi - partite pure entangled states is the schmidt decomposition @xcite  representation of the given state as a sum of product terms , where the basic states are eigenvectors of marginal density matrices . for continuous - variable ( cv ) problems ,",
    "the schmidt decomposition gives an effectively finite - dimensional hilbert space and entanglement is characterized by the schmidt number  reciprocal of the sum of marginal density operator eigenvalues .",
    "in a recent series of publications , see further references in @xcite , concerning the schmidt decomposition - based analysis of various problems , the entanglement parameters were calculated mainly from numerical decomposition .",
    "in fact , the only exception is the case of double - gaussian wave function with analytically known decomposition , see for example @xcite or gaussian mixed states @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to discuss another way of the schmidt number calculation  from marginal purity .",
    "this method is rarely mentioned in the published works , however in many cases it enables to obtain the schmidt number ( in exact or approximate form ) analytically , and , for certain tasks , eliminate the need to calculate the decomposition itself .",
    "the schmidt decomposition , known also by different other names in various scientific fields @xcite , in quantum theory is an analysis of non - separable wavefunctions via representation @xmath0 where the state vectors @xmath1 and @xmath2 forms orthonormal systems belonging to different parts of the composite quantum system and all @xmath3 .",
    "these state vectors are eigenvectors of marginal density matrices of sub - systems , and coefficients @xmath4 are corresponding eigenvalues . according to the decomposition ( [ eq-1 ] )",
    ", different schmidt modes appears in parts of a system in pairs , reflecting correlations between sub - systems .    for cv systems",
    ", there is in principle infinite countable set of eigenvalues @xmath4 .",
    "however , for all quantum systems , sum of all eigenvalues is essentially finite , therefore only the limited number of eigenvalues has significant value , and the whole entangled system becomes effectively finite - dimensional @xcite .",
    "the number of significant terms in representation ( [ eq-1 ] ) can be characterized by the value @xmath5 effective number of the schmidt modes ( or the schmidt number ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the schmidt number is expressed via trace of squared marginal density matrix ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 are partial traces over respective sub - system ) @xmath8",
    "@xmath9    eigenvector decomposition is optimal from several points of view , see detail in @xcite , but it can be calculated analytically only in several special cases . despite the mathematical methods to treat this problem",
    "effectively @xcite , it is desirable to deal at least with entanglement degree analytically .",
    "schmidt number is closely related to `` generalized entropies '' ( or generalized purities ) , proposed by rnyi , tsallis @xcite and others , see further references in @xcite : @xmath10 ( @xmath11 is a marginal density matrix ) . here",
    "the limit @xmath12 leads to usual shannon - von neumann entropy , standard parameter for entanglement charactetization @xcite and the case @xmath13 ( purity , or  linear entropy  ) gives the schmidt number @xmath14 the schmidt number has a special meaning .",
    "first of all , it can be measured in a single - photon counting experiment , see @xcite and the references therein . from theoretical point of view , for the whole family of parameters ( [ eq-4 ] ) , the schmidt number is most easy to calculate , just using the formula ( [ eq-3 ] ) , without knowledge of the decomposition eigenvalues .",
    "an entangled atom - field wavefunction in dimensionless momentum representation in simplest case depends on only one parameter @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16  the control parameter , ratio of thermal ( motional ) line broadening @xmath17 to a natural linewidth @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a normalization constant .    for this model , in the raman scattering regime @xcite , control parameter value can be as large as @xmath20 , opening a way of experimental realization of high - entanglement regime .    in the papers @xcite ,",
    "numerical treatment is applied for the schmidt decomposition , leading to following expression for @xmath21 at large @xmath16 ( result of numerical fitting ) @xmath22    on the other hand , a straightforward analytical integration according to ( [ eq-3a ] ) gives marginal ( atom ) density function @xmath23 together with a normalization constant @xmath24 .",
    "another step of integration according to ( [ eq-3 ] ) leads to analytical formula for the schmidt number @xmath25 which has simple asymptotic form for @xmath26 @xmath27    resulting dependencies @xmath21 for these three expressions are presented in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "it is seen , that all the graphs are quite close to each other .",
    "the main task of the present paper  to provide a simplest example of an already known , but not widely used method of the schmidt number calculation .",
    "the schmidt decomposition and the schmidt number prove to be quite efficient method for characterization of pure state bi - partite entanglement , however , its analytical calculation is possible just in a very limited number of cases . among the used simple example , analytical ( or semi - analytical ) expressions can be found for another cases , for example , for more generalized two - parametric atom - field entanglement model @xcite .",
