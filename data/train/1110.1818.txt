    "quantum key distribution is well applied to cryptography due to its unconditional security based on quantum mechanics.@xcite in particular , continuous - variable quantum key distribution ( cv qkd ) has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potentially faster and more efficient detection and key rate than single - photon qkd.@xcite one - way cv qkd allows the quantum state to pass through the channel only from the sender ( alice ) to the receiver ( bob ) , which brings a limitation that the channel loss is no more than 3 db in direct reconciliation.@xcite although the post - selection@xcite or the reverse reconciliation@xcite overcomes this drawback , the secret key rate is strongly affected by excess noise.@xcite to enhance the tolerable excess noise , the two - way cv - qkd protocols are proposed to go beyond the 3 db limit and meanwhile tolerate more excess noise than one - way protocols.@xcite    the procedure of implementing the original two - way cv protocol is briefly introduced below . the entanglement - based ( eb ) scheme of a sub - protocol in the original two - way protocols , @xmath0 protocol , is shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , and can be described as:@xcite    _ step one_. bob initially prepares an epr pair with variance @xmath1 and keeps one mode @xmath2 while sending the other mode @xmath3 to alice through the channel where eve may perform her attack .",
    "_ step two_. alice encodes her information by applying a random phase - space displacement operator @xmath4 to her received mode @xmath5 and then sends the mode @xmath6 back to bob through the channel . note that @xmath7 , and @xmath8 or @xmath9 has a random gaussian modulation with the variance of @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "_ step three_. bob measures both his original mode @xmath2 and received mode @xmath11 with heterodyne detection to get the variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 as well as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "_ step four_. alice and bob implement the postprocessing including reconciliation and privacy amplification.@xcite in this procedure , bob needs to combine both outcomes from @xmath2 and @xmath11 to construct the optimal estimator to alice s corresponding variables \\{@xmath8 , @xmath9}. after the steps above , alice and bob can share a string of identical key that eve does not know .    however , to analyze the security under general collective attack , the original two - way protocols need to construct the hybrid protocol where alice randomly switches between one - way ( switch off , where alice detects the incoming mode and sends a new state back to bob ) and two - way schemes ( switch on ) for implementing the tomography of the quantum channels and for both parameter estimation and key distribution,@xcite as shown in fig.1 .",
    "this hybrid scheme increases the complexity in a real setup .",
    "moreover , it is difficult to implement the tomography of quantum channels in a real experiment . in this paper",
    ", we modify the original two - way protocol by replacing the displacement operation and the on - off switch with a passive operation on alice s side , and give a feasible prepare - and - measure ( pm ) scheme , which pushes the two - way protocol to be easily applied in practice . considering that gaussian collective attack is optimal",
    ", we will prove the security of the new protocol under collective entangling cloner attacks which are a special case of general gaussian collective attack thoroughly researched in ref .  .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 contains the statements of our new two - way cv - qkd protocol . in sec .",
    "3 , we give a theoretical analysis of the security of the new two - way cv - qkd protocol against gaussian collective attack by using the optimality of gaussian collective attack . in sec .",
    "4 , we investigate the numerical simulation of the secret key rate under collective entangling cloner attacks . finally , in sec . 5",
    ", we conclude our results and indicate some open questions .",
    "we modify the original two - way protocols by replacing the displacement operation and the on - off switch with the passive operation on alice s side .",
    "the eb scheme of @xmath16 protocol after modifying the @xmath0 protocol is shown in fig .",

    "the second and fourth steps of @xmath0 are changed into    _",
    "step @xmath17_. with using a beam splitter ( transmittance : @xmath18 ) , alice couples one mode of another epr pair ( variance : @xmath19 ) with the received mode @xmath5 from bob and sends the coupling mode @xmath6 back to bob .",
    "she also measures the other mode @xmath20 of this epr pair with heterodyne detection to get the variables \\{@xmath21 , @xmath22 } and randomly measures the position quadrature @xmath23 or the momentum quadrature @xmath24 of the coupling mode @xmath25 from the beam splitter with homodyne detection .",
    "_ step @xmath26_. alice and bob implement the postprocessing including the reconciliation and privacy amplification.@xcite in this procedure , the homodyne detection on the mode @xmath25 is used to estimate the channel s parameters and bob uses @xmath27 and @xmath28 to construct the optimal estimator to alice s corresponding variables \\{@xmath21 , @xmath22 } , where @xmath29 is the channel s total transmittance which is obtained by reconciliation .",
    "the other steps of @xmath16 are the same as those of @xmath0 .    in fig .",
    "1(b ) , alice s beam splitter @xmath18 couples the two uncorrelated states respectively from alice and bob .",
    "the action of the beam splitter @xmath18 is equivalent to a unitary transformation .",
    "one output mode @xmath25 of this beam splitter is kept and measured on alice s side and the other mode @xmath6 is sent to bob though the channel .",
    "the effects of system parameters and environment parameters on entanglement are discussed in detail in ref .  .",
    "here the two channels affect the entanglement degrees of those three pairs of states : @xmath2 and @xmath25 , @xmath2 and @xmath11 , and @xmath20 and @xmath11 .",
    "the effect on the channels can be ascribed to the action of eve .",
    "considering one - mode gaussian attack , the two channels can be described as two independent gaussian - entangling - cloner attacks.@xcite it is necessary to estimate the channel s parameters by the measurement values of alice and bob in security analysis .",
    "the pm scheme of @xmath16 protocol is shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) , which is equivalent to the eb scheme in fig . 1(b).@xcite in fig 1(c ) , with using the random numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 , bob randomly modulates the amplitude ( @xmath32 ) and the phase ( @xmath33 ) of the coherent state from his laser source ( ls1 ) , and then sends the state to alice .",
    "alice s laser source ( ls2 ) is coherent with bob s ls1 by phaselock and time synchronization techniques.@xcite similar to bob s modulation , alice uses two other random numbers @xmath34 and @xmath35 to encode information .",

    "in addition , the other original@xcite ( e.g. , @xmath36 ) can be modified to new protocol ( e.g. , @xmath37 ) by changing the displacement into the coupling of the epr pair , correspondingly . according to bob s detection",
    ", we also propose a new sub - protocol @xmath38-@xmath39 ( @xmath40-@xmath41 ) where bob measures his mode @xmath2 with homodyne ( heterodyne ) detection and measures his mode @xmath11 with heterodyne ( homodyne ) detection .",
    "we consider the eb scheme of @xmath16 protocol in reverse reconciliation . the secret key rate is@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the reconciliation efficiency , @xmath44 is the mutual information between alice and bob , @xmath45 is the mutual information between eve and bob .    according to _ step @xmath26 _ , in fig .",

    "1(b ) is used for security analysis . in fig .",
    "2 , bob applies two unitary transformations @xmath52 to the modes @xmath53 and @xmath54 as well as to the modes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , in order to get @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) by measuring the position ( momentum ) quadrature of @xmath59 ( or @xmath60 ) . note the order of the transformation , e.g. , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the @xmath23 and @xmath24 quadratures of the modes @xmath66 and @xmath59 and @xmath52 is a continuous - variable c - not gate@xcite @xmath67 considering the assumption that eve has no access to the interior of bob,@xcite eve obtains the information only from bob s input and output . because the unitary transformation @xmath52 does nt change the von neumann entropy of the system@xcite @xmath68 and the variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 are same to both figs .",

    "1(b ) and 2 .",
    "thus , we use fig . 2 to analyze the security in the following .",
    "first , we show that the gaussian attack is optimal to the new protocol . according to the _ step @xmath17 _ and",

    "this is equivalent to the scheme that alice and bob measure the mode @xmath20 with heterodyne detection and measure the modes @xmath25 , @xmath66 , @xmath59 , @xmath69 and @xmath60 with homodyne detection in fig .",
    "2 , i.e. , alice and bob measure all modes except eve s modes . in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the states of eve , the modes @xmath73 and the modes @xmath74 , respectively . it is easily seen that @xmath75 is a pure state and @xmath76 is the purification of @xmath70 . because alice and bob s heterodyne or homodyne detection on their modes does not mix the @xmath23 and @xmath24 quadratures and alice and bob use the second - order moments of the quadratures to calculate the secret key rate bound , the new protocol can satisfy the requirement of the optimality of gaussian collective attack.@xcite thus , when the corresponding covariance matrix @xmath77 of @xmath76 is known and fixed for alice and bob , the gaussian attack is optimal.@xcite therefore , eve s accessible information can be bounded by only considering eve s gaussian collective attack . in the following part , @xmath45 is calculated using some ideas proposed in ref .  .",

    "the security of the new two - way cv - qkd protocols against collective entangling cloner attacks is proved without randomly switching between one - way and two - way schemes for the quantum - channel tomography .",
