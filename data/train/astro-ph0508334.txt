    "surveys for galaxies containing active galactic nuclei ( agns ) or strong star - formation activity have been an important area of extragalactic astronomy for decades .",
    "many fruitful surveys have been carried out with wide - field schmidt telescopes used in conjunction with objective prisms .",
    "an overview of previous surveys is given in salzer _ etal .",
    "_  ( 2000 ) , along with a sampling of the types of applications that such surveys have for the study of the extragalactic universe .",
    "we have been carrying out a modern objective - prism survey for the past several years . called the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) , it combines many of the advantages of older surveys with the use of state - of - the - art ccd detectors , providing superior depth and data quality .",
    "the digital nature of kiss has many advantages over the older photographic surveys of this type ( e.g. , markarian 1967 ; smith , aguirre & zemelman 1976 ; macalpine , smith & lewis 1977 ; pesch & sanduleak 1983 ; wasilewski 1983 ; markarian , lipovetskii , & stepanian 1983 ; zamorano _ etal . _  1994 ; popescu _ etal .",
    "_  1996 ; surace & comte 1998 ; ugryumov _ etal .",
    "_  1999 ) .",
    "besides the obvious factors of higher sensitivity and speed , we stress the importance of being able to measure the completeness limits and selection function of the survey directly from the data used to derive the catalogs of kiss emission - line galaxies ( elgs ) .",
    "this is not possible with photographic survey material , and makes kiss particularly useful for statistical studies of galaxian activity in the nearby universe .",
    "the current survey lists cover the area of the sky included in the noao deep wide - field survey ( ndwfs ; jannuzi & dey 1999 , jannuzi _ etal .",
    "_  in preparation , dey _ etal .",
    "_  in preparation ) .",
    "ndwfs is a deep optical and nir imaging survey carried out in two well separated fields .",
    "all optical data were taken on the noao 4-m telescopes in the bri bandpasses , while jhk imaging was carried out on the kpno 2.1-m telescope .",
    "the fields were both covered to a uniform depth of b @xmath9 26.6 ( and correspondingly deep in the other five bands ) .",
    "we chose to observe these fields as part of kiss because of the expectation that they would become well observed at many wavelengths as various groups studied the properties of the ndwfs galaxies . while the primary science goals of the ndwfs focus on galaxies at redshifts well beyond the filter - imposed redshift limit of kiss ( z @xmath10 0.095 ) , the volume covered by our survey is sufficiently large to provide a good - sized sample of star - forming galaxies and agns",
    ". bolstered by the large amount of data becoming available for the galaxies in the ndwfs area at radio , fir , nir , uv , x - ray , and optical wavelengths , the kiss elgs should allow for a number of detailed statistical studies of activity in galaxies in the local universe .",
    "while the kiss data are completely independent of the ndwfs data , they can be used to complement and extend the usefulness of the latter .",
    "this is the fifth paper in the kiss series .",
    "the first presents a complete description of the survey method , including a discussion of the survey data and its associated uncertainties ( salzer _ etal . _  2000 ; hereafter paper i )",
    ". the first and second survey lists of h@xmath0-selected elgs , informally referred to as the red survey , are given in salzer _ etal . _",
    "( 2001 ; hereafter kr1 ) and gronwall _ etal . _",

    "_  ( 2002 ; hereafter kb1 ) .",
    "the current paper follows a format similar to kr1 and kr2 ; for the sake of brevity , the reader is referred to kr1 , kr2 , and paper i for many details .",
    "the observational data and image processing are described in section 2 , while the new list of elg candidates is presented in section 3 .",
    "the properties of the new list of h@xmath0-selected elgs are described in section 4 , while our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "all survey data were acquired using the 0.61-meter burrell schmidt telescope . the detector used for all data reported here was a 2048 @xmath11 4096 pixel site ccd .",
    "the ccd is identical to the one used for the kr2 list , however this is not the same ccd that was used for kr1 or kb1 , giving a different image scale and field - of - view .",
    "the ccd has 15-@xmath12 pixels , yielding an image scale of 1.43 arcsec / pixel at the newtonian focus of the telescope .",
    "the overall field - of - view was 50 @xmath11 100 arcmin , and each image covered 1.37 square degrees .",
    "the long dimension of the ccd was oriented north - south during our survey observations . the red survey spectral data were obtained with a 4@xmath5 prism , which provided a reciprocal dispersion of 17  / pixel at h@xmath0 .",
    "the spectral data were obtained through a special filter designed for the survey , which covered the spectral range 6400  7200   ( see figure 1 of paper i for the filter transmission curve ) .    the two ndwfs fields each cover an area of 9 sq .",
    "the spring ( botes ) field is centered at ra = 14@xmath2  30@xmath3 , dec = 34@xmath5  30@xmath6 ( b1950 ) .",
    "it consists of a 3 @xmath11 3 degree square field .",
    "the fall ( cetus ) field is a 2.3 @xmath11 4.0 degree area centered at ra = 2@xmath2  7.5@xmath3 , dec = -4@xmath5  44@xmath6 ( b1950 ) .",
    "the layout of the botes field allowed us to cover the ndwfs area with two rows of kiss fields , with four fields per row .",
    "there is essentially zero overlap in declination between the two rows of fields . in addition , due to larger than normal pointing offsets between the direct and spectral fields ( see below ) , there are modest gaps between some of the fields within a given row .",
    "the net result is that the kiss data for the botes field only cover 8.08 sq . deg .",
    ", rather than the full 9 sq",
    ". deg . for the cetus fields",
    ", we again utilized two rows of kiss fields .",
    "however , in this case there is substantial overlap between the upper and lower rows , due to the fact that the declination extent of this ndwfs region is smaller .",
    "furthermore , we needed 6 kiss fields per row to cover the full 4.0 degrees of ra .",
    "despite the declination overlap , the cetus kiss fields cover a total area of 12.57 sq .",
    ", substantially larger than the area of the ndwfs fields .",
    "the total area covered by the kiss observations is 19.65 sq .",
    "deg .    as with our previous survey strips",
    ", we obtained images of each survey field both with and without the objective prism on the telescope .",
    "the images taken without the prism ( referred to as direct images ) were obtained through standard b and v filters .",
    "the direct images were photometrically calibrated , and provide accurate astrometry and photometry for all sources in the survey fields .",
    "we used uniform exposure times for all survey fields : 4 @xmath11 720 s for the objective - prism ( spectral ) data , and 2 @xmath11 300 s for v and 1 @xmath11 600 s in b for the direct images .",
    "the telescope was dithered by a small amount ( @xmath1310 arcsec ) between exposures .",
    "table [ table : tab1 ] lists the observing runs during which the current set of survey fields were observed .",
    "the first column gives the ut dates of the run , while the second column indicates the number of nights on which observations were obtained .",
    "at least some data were obtained on 12 of 14 scheduled nights ( 86% ) .",
    "the last two columns indicate the number of direct and spectral images , respectively , obtained during each run .",
    "it was common practice to observe in both direct and spectral modes during parts of each run , although it was not always the case that the direct and spectral images of a given field were obtained during the same run .",
    "all data reduction took place using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) software .",
    "a special package of iraf - based routines that were written by members of the kiss team was used for most of the data analysis .",
    "full details of the observing procedures and data reduction methods are given in paper i and kr1 .",
    "the selection of the third red ( h@xmath0 ) list of elg candidates was carried out in precisely the same fashion as the first and second red lists ( kr1 and kr2 ) .",
    "full details are presented in paper i and kr1 . to briefly summarize",
    ", we use our automated kiss software to evaluate the extracted objective - prism spectrum of each object located within a survey field . all objects with spectral features that rise",
    "more than five times the local noise above the continuum level are flagged as potential elgs .",
    "this 5@xmath14 threshold is the primary selection criterion of the survey , and was arrived at after substantial testing during the early phases of the kiss project . following the initial automated selection ,",
    "all candidates are visually examined , and spurious sources are removed from the sample .",
    "finally , the objective - prism images are scanned visually for sources that might have been missed by the software .",
    "these tend to be objects where the emission line is redshifted to the red end of the objective - prism spectrum , so that the software can not detect continuum on both sides of the line . the combination of our automated selection process and our careful visual checking helps to ensure a high degree of reliability that the kiss elg candidates are real , and that the sample is largely complete for all objects with 5@xmath14 emission lines .",
    "as described in kr1 , we also flag objects that have emission lines between 4@xmath14 and 5@xmath14 during our selection process .",
    "these 4@xmath14 detections represent objects with somewhat weaker emission lines than the main kiss sample , but that are nonetheless valid elg candidates .",
    "however , these objects do not constitute a statistically complete sample in the same sense as the main ( @xmath15 5@xmath14 ) list .",
    "we report the 45@xmath14 sources in a secondary list of elg candidates ( see appendix ) , which should be thought of as a supplement to the main kiss catalog .",
    "this list of  extra \" ( or kissrx ) objects likely includes a number of interesting sources .",
    "the list of elg candidates selected in the third red survey is presented in table [ table : tab2 ] .",
    "because the survey data includes both spectral images and photometrically - calibrated direct images , we are able to include a great deal of useful information about each source , such as accurate photometry and astrometry and estimates of the redshift , emission - line flux and equivalent width . only the first page of the table is printed here ; the complete table is available in the electronic version of this paper .",
    "the contents of the survey table are as follows .",
    "column 1 gives a running number for each object in the survey with the designation kissr @xmath16 , where kissr stands for `` kiss red '' survey .",
    "this is to distinguish it from the blue kiss survey ( kb1 ) .",
    "the kr1 and kr2 survey lists included kissr objects 12157 , and here we present kissr objects 21582418 . columns 2 and 3 give the object identification from the kiss database tables , where the first number indicates the survey field ( f@xmath16 ) , and the second number is the identification number within the field table for that galaxy .",
    "this identifier is necessary for locating the kiss elgs within the survey database tables .",
    "columns 4 and 5 list the right ascension and declination of each object ( j2000 ) .",
    "the formal uncertainties in the coordinates are 0.25 arcsec in ra and 0.20 arcsec in declination .",
    "column 6 gives the b magnitude , while column 7 lists the b@xmath17v color . for brighter objects ,",
    "the magnitude estimates typically have uncertainties of 0.05 mag , increasing to @xmath130.10 mag at b = 20 .",
    "paper i includes a complete discussion of the precision of both the astrometry and photometry of the kiss objects .",
    "an estimate of the redshift of each galaxy , based on its objective - prism spectrum , in given in column 8 .",
    "this estimate assumes that the emission line seen in the objective - prism spectrum is h@xmath0 .",
    "follow - up spectra for @xmath151600 elg candidates from the two red survey lists ( kr1 , kr2 and the current list ) show that this assumption is correct in the vast majority of cases .",
    "only four elgs in the current list that possess follow - up spectra ( 3% ) are high redshift objects where a different line ( typically [ ] and/or h@xmath18 ) appears in the objective - prism spectrum . the formal uncertainty in the redshift estimates is @xmath19 = 0.0028 ( see section 4.1.3 ) .",
    "columns 9 and 10 list the emission - line flux ( in units of 10@xmath20 erg / s / cm@xmath8 ) and equivalent width ( in  ) measured from the objective - prism spectra .",
    "the calibration of the fluxes is discussed in section 4.1.2 .",
    "these quantities should be taken as being representative estimates only . a simple estimate of the reliability of each source , the quality flag ( qflag ) , is given in column 11 .",
    "this quantity , assigned during the line measurement step of the data processing , is given the value of 1 for high quality sources , 2 for lower quality but still reliable objects , and 3 for somewhat less reliable sources .",
    "column 12 gives alternate identifications for kiss elgs which have been cataloged previously .",
    "this is not an exhaustive cross - referencing , but focuses on previous objective - prism surveys which overlap part or all of the current survey area : markarian ( 1967 ) and case ( pesch & sanduleak 1983 ) .",
    "the markarian survey overlaps both the botes and cetus fields , while the case survey only overlaps the botes field .",
    "also included are objects in common with the _ uppsala general catalogue of galaxies _ ( ugc , nilson 1973 ) .",
    "a total of 261 elg candidates are included in this third list of h@xmath0-selected kiss galaxies .",
    "the total area covered by the third red survey strip is 19.65 deg@xmath8 , meaning that there are 13.3 kiss elgs per square degree .",
    "for the first , second , and third red lists combined , the surface density is 16.4 galaxies deg@xmath22 , and if the lower significance kissrx objects are included the density is 20.7 elgs deg@xmath22 .",
    "this compares to the surface density of 0.1 galaxies deg@xmath22 from the markarian ( 1967 ) survey , and 0.56 galaxies per deg@xmath8 from the h@xmath0-selected ucm survey ( zamorano _ etal . _",
    "1994 ) ; the present survey is much deeper despite the redshift limit inherent in our detection method .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fraction of 4@xmath14 ",
    "5@xmath14 kissrx elg candidates is substantially higher for the sample presented here than for the first and second red survey areas .",
    "as discussed below , we believe that this difference is caused by the somewhat different noise characteristics of the ccd used for the current survey . for example , elgs that would have been 5.0@xmath14 objects when observed with the previous ccd might be detected as 4.8@xmath14 sources in the current data .",
    "the net effect would be to lower the number of objects in the main survey list and to shift some of them into the kissrx list . if both the lower - significance kissrx objects and the _ bona fide _",
    "kissr objects are combined , the surface density of elg candidates is essentially constant for all three red survey lists .",

    "these additional galaxies do not constitute a statistically complete sample , and should therefore be used with caution",
    ". however , there are likely many interesting objects contained in this supplementary list . hence , following the precedent established in kr1 and kr2 , we list these objects in order to give a full accounting of the elgs in the area surveyed .",
    "due to the manner in which the survey is carried out , a great deal of observational data are available for all of the kiss elg candidates cataloged in the current paper .",
    "this includes accurate astrometry and b and v photometry for each source , as well as estimates of the redshift , h@xmath0 + [ ] line fluxes and equivalent widths .",
    "the combination of these data allow us to acquire a fairly complete picture of the make - up of the kiss sample . however , the quantities derived from the objective - prism spectra are inadequate for detailed analyses",
    ". first , the low resolution of the spectra limits the accuracy of the redshifts measured ( see below ) .",
    "further , the combination of low resolution and limited spectral coverage prevent us from using the survey data to ascertain the activity type of the elgs ( e.g. , agn vs. star - forming ) .",
    "hence follow - up spectra obtained with a higher dispersion spectrograph are required for a complete understanding of the kiss elgs .",
    "nonetheless , much can be gleamed about the survey constituents with the data currently available .",
    "we present an overview of the properties of our new sample of kiss elgs below .        the b - band apparent magnitude distribution for the 261 kiss elgs in the current survey list is shown in figure  [ fig : appmag]a .",
    "the median apparent b magnitude is 17.91 .",
    "this value is somewhat brighter than those of the kr1 and kr2 survey lists , which have median apparent magnitudes of b = 18.08 and 18.13 , respectively .",
    "however , it is clear that kiss still probes substantially deeper than previous objective - prism surveys : the median apparent magnitude for the h@xmath0-selected ucm survey ( prez - gonzlez _ etal . _  2000 ) is b @xmath9 16.1 , and the [ ] -selected michigan ( um ) survey ( salzer _ etal . _  1989 )",
    "has a median apparent magnitude of b = 16.9 .",
    "indicated in the figure is the completeness limit of the markarian survey , b = 15.2 ( mazzarella & balzano 1989 ) .",
    "-0.1 in = 5.0 in 1.0 in    the distribution of the b@xmath17v colors of the third red survey list is shown in figure  [ fig : appmag]b .",
    "the median color is 0.67 , which is identical to that of the first red survey list and very close to that of the kr2 survey list ( b@xmath17v = 0.69 ) .",
    "this color is representative of an sb galaxy ( roberts & haynes 1994 ) .",
    "the ucm survey shows a similar color distribution , and has a median color of b@xmath17r = 0.71 ( prez - gonzlez _ etal .",
    "_  2000 ) .",
    "in contrast , the [ ] -selected kb1 and um surveys have color distributions that are significantly shifted to the blue , with median b@xmath17v colors of 0.50 and 0.55 , respectively ( kb1 ; salzer _ etal . _  1989 ) .",
    "this is a selection effect caused by the use of different emission lines for detection in the different surveys .",
    "the h@xmath0-selected samples include a broader spectrum of elgs , including many more luminous star - forming galaxies and liners which tend to be dominated by older , redder stellar populations .",
    "in addition , they are able to detect galaxies with higher levels of intrinsic reddening . the [ ] -selected samples are dominated by lower luminosity , lower metallicity galaxies which are dominated by younger stellar populations and have lower levels of internal absorption and reddening .",
    "while the h@xmath0-selected surveys tend to include both types of elgs , they are dominated by the more luminous galaxies .",
    "in contrast , the blue - selected surveys tend to not select the redder galaxies at all .",
    "the distribution of equivalent widths ( ews ) for the third red survey list is shown in figure  [ fig : ew ] .",
    "we assume that the line we measure in the survey spectra is h@xmath0 blended with the [ ] @xmath236584,6548 lines .",
    "based on follow - up observations obtained to date , we know this assumption to be true for the vast majority of red survey objects .",
    "the three lines are blended at the resolution of the objective - prism spectra .",

    "the median equivalent width of h@xmath0 + [ ] is 50.5  , with the majority of elgs having equivalent widths of less than 100  .",
    "this median ew is approximately 25% higher for this sample than for the two previous red survey lists .",
    "the noise level in the third red survey list data is slightly higher than for the first and second red survey list .",
    "we attribute this to the use of a different ccd for the newer sample , which had somewhat worse noise characteristics than the previous ccd .",
    "this shift in noise characteristics results in a selection of 5@xmath14 elg candidates that have relatively stronger lines . as we mention above the fraction of 4@xmath14 ",

    "the fluxes are then calibrated on an absolute scale , using information obtained from the follow - up spectra . from a sample of",
    "126 follow - up observations , we selected 49 objects that were classified as star - forming galaxies , had spectral quality @xmath25 or 2 , and had been observed with a long - slit spectrograph under photometric conditions .",
    "all spectra were obtained during the same observing run , and are of galaxies located in the botes field . since the fluxes measured from the objective - prism spectra are a combination of the h@xmath0 and [ ] lines , we use the fluxes from our slit spectra for the sum of these three lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfluxcal ] shows a plot of the ratio of objective - prism flux ( in counts ) to spectroscopic flux _ versus _ the equivalent width measured from the follow - up spectra .",
    "the majority of the emission - line flux from a point source was included in the follow - up spectra , since the slit width used was 2.0 . some galaxies ,",
    "however , have a larger angular extent and the emission lines originate in an extended region .",
    "since our long - slit measurements do not include all the h@xmath0 emission from these sources , they tend to have large flux ratios .",
    "we restricted the calibration sample to those galaxies with an objective - prism - to - spectroscopic flux ratio of less than 20 and an equivalent width greater than 40  , which left 25 galaxies .",
    "the emission regions of these galaxies are essentially point sources .",
    "the median flux ratio of the calibration sample is 12.61 ; the mean is 12.92 with a standard deviation of 4.19 and an error in the mean of 0.84 .",

    "however , the median line flux of the third red survey list is substantially fainter than that of the ucm sample , which is @xmath29 ergs / s / cm@xmath8 ( based on follow - up spectra of gallego _ etal . _  1996 ) .",
    "-0.0 in = 5.0 in 1.0 in    as mentioned earlier , one of the strengths of kiss is that the selection function and completeness limit can be derived using the survey data directly , rather than relying on secondary information ( e.g. , line strengths measured from follow - up spectra ) .",

    "column ( 8) shows the percentage of objects that are in the flux - limited subsample , which decreases continuously as m@xmath30 becomes fainter . column ( 9 ) lists the completeness percentage of the flux - limited subsample as a function of m@xmath30 .",
    "these latter two quantities are plotted in figure  [ fig : complete ] .",

    "rather than repeating that discussion here , we will simply summarize the main results .",
    "it is important to realize that because of the redshift limit imposed by the survey filter , objects in the sample can be either line - flux - limited or volume - limited objects , depending on the strength of their h@xmath0 + [ ] emission and their redshift .",
    "objects with sufficiently strong lines will have values of v@xmath31 that exceed the effective volume of the survey set by the redshift limit .",
    "such objects are volume limited .",

    "we see that the kiss sample is 100% complete to m@xmath30 = 15.3 , which is very similar to the results for the kr1 and kr2 samples ( gronwall _ etal . _  2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "this completeness limit includes 184 kiss elgs , or 70 .. 5% of the full sample .",
    "as is often done , one can construct a ",
    "correctably complete \" sample by extending the line - flux limit down to even lower values .",
    "for example , at m@xmath30 = 15.9 , the sample is still 69.2% complete , but now includes 91.2% of the sample .",
    "we also derive redshifts from the objective - prism spectra . for objects with follow - up observations",
    ", we can compare the survey redshifts to the redshifts derived from the long - slit spectra ( figure  [ fig : zcompare ] ) .",
    "in general the agreement between @xmath35 ( objective - prism redshift ) and @xmath36 ( follow - up redshift ) is excellent .",
    "only four objects deviate substantially from the equality line .",
    "two of these are active galaxies at @xmath37 which are not shown in the diagram .",
    "they were detected due to their [ ] @xmath385007 and h@xmath18 lines , respectively .",
    "the remaining two objects are kissr 2336 and kissr 2320 ; two relatively large , well - resolved disk galaxies that both have emission regions which are offset from the center of the galaxy .",
    "because the dispersion of the objective - prism spectra is in the north - south direction , a spectrum of an object that has an emission region spatially offset north or south of the center will yield an incorrect estimate of the redshift of the emission line .",
    "only a small minority of kiss objects are affected by this .    for the first red survey list ( kr1 )",
    "the survey redshifts above @xmath39 showed a systematic offset from the redshifts determined from follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the reason for the offset is that as the h@xmath0 + [ ] line in the objective - prism spectrum begins to shift out of the survey bandpass , only the lower - redshift portion of the line is detected .",
    "a correction was applied to the kr1 survey redshifts , as described in paper i. the objects plotted in figure  [ fig : zcompare ] do not display this offset , and no correction was applied to the survey redshifts . the second red survey list ( kr2 )",
    "also did not show any systematic offset .",
    "the reason for the difference is probably the better pixel scale of the ccd used for the second and third red survey lists .",
    "when we calculate the rms scatter of @xmath35 about the equality line we use only objects with @xmath40 , as was done for kr1 .",
    "we exclude the four most deviant objects that we described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the resulting rms scatter is 0.0032 ( 950 km / s ) , which is marginally higher than the value found for the first two red survey lists ( 0.0028 , or 840 km / s ) .",

    "are taken from falco _ etal . _  ( 1999 ) .",
    "since the surface density of the cgcg catalog is fairly low , we included objects located in a region of @xmath41 degrees , centered at the location of the botes field .",
    "the cgcg catalog does not extend far enough south to overlap the cetus field , hence the comparison sample applies only to the upper ( botes ) redshift sample .",
    "the botes void ( kirshner _ etal .",
    "_  1981 ) is clearly visible between @xmath42 and @xmath43 in figure  [ fig : zhist]a . even thought the ndwfs field",
    "is located far south of the nominal void center , the impact of the void is unmistakable in the redshift distribution .",
    "there is a significant density enhancement seen at redshifts between 0.0275 and 0.0375 , just in front of the void .",
    "this is most likely associated with the hercules supercluster .",
    "a modest peak in the redshift distribution of the cgcg sample is also seen in this redshift range .",
    "the latter becomes quite sparse beyond this redshift .",
    "the cgcg sample also shows a strong peak at z = 0.0125 which is less prominent in the kiss distribution .",
    "of the 41 cgcg galaxies that constitute this peak , only four are found inside the botes field survey area .",
    "the galaxies in this peak appear to fall along a large - scale structure feature that falls mostly outside the ndwfs area . beyond the botes",
    "void the kiss sample displays a fairly flat redshift distribution out to z  @xmath13  0.085 , after which it begins to drop off .",
    "the distribution drops to zero at z = 0.095 , because kiss can not detect galaxies via the h@xmath0 line beyond this distance since it redshifts completely out of the survey filter at this point . the flat distribution and drop - off between 0.085 and 0.095 are characteristic of what is seen with the kr1 and kr2 samples as well .",
    "-0.1 in = 5.0 in 1.0 in    the redshift distribution for the cetus field ( figure  [ fig : zhist]c ) is dominated by a low density region at low redshifts that reaches out to z = 0.035 .",
    "this is part of the large void that dominates the foreground in the south galactic cap .",
    "there is no hint of the pisces - perseus supercluster at z  @xmath9  0.020 ; the cetus field is far enough south to miss the supercluster .",
    "there is a strong density enhancement at z = 0.040 . beyond this point ,",
    "the kiss redshift distribution is again fairly flat out the the point where the survey filter starts to exclude the h@xmath0 line .",
    "note that the location of the cetus field is such that only very sparse redshift information of the ",
    "normal \" galaxies exists .",
    "hence , we do not have a suitable comparison sample as we do with the botes field .",
    "the median redshifts of the two ndwfs kiss samples are quite similar to the values found for kr1 ( median z = 0.063 ) and kr2 ( median z = 0.061 ) .",
    "the availability of both an accurate apparent magnitude and a redshift estimate allows us to compute the absolute magnitude for each source . using the values listed in table 2 for the b magnitude and objective - prism redshift , we compute m@xmath44 for all elg candidates in the current list . h@xmath45 = 75 km / s / mpc is adopted , and a correction for galactic absorption is applied using the values for a@xmath44 compiled by schlegel _ etal . _",
    "( 1998 ) . in both fields",
    "the galactic absorption is small , with typical values of 0.04  0.06 mags in the botes field , and 0.09  0.11 mags in the cetus region .",
    "an explicit assumption made is that the line seen in the objective - prism spectrum is in fact h@xmath0 .",
    "previous observations of kr1 and kr2 elgs suggest that for roughly 2.5% of the kiss elg candidates the line seen in the objective - prism spectrum is some other line ( usually [ ] @xmath385007 ) .",
    "hence we might expect 6 - 7 of the elg candidates in table 2 to fall in this category .",
    "a histogram showing the distribution of m@xmath44 for the kiss elgs in the current survey list is shown in figure 10a .",
    "for comparison , in figure 10b we plot the absolute magnitude distribution for the 97 cgcg galaxies used in the redshift distribution comparison in the previous subsection .",
    "note that for this presentation we have combined the two portions of the kiss ndwfs sample into a single histogram .",
    "the median absolute magnitudes of the kiss and cgcg galaxies differ significantly : while the cgcg has a median m@xmath44 = @xmath1719.78 ( i.e. , close to m@xmath46 ) , the kiss elgs have a median absolute magnitude fully 2/3rds of a magnitude fainter .",
    "this is consistent with our previous survey lists .",
    "that is , kiss is especially sensitive to intermediate and low luminosity galaxies when compared to a magnitude - limited sample like the cgcg .    despite the fact that the current sample of kiss elgs have systematically lower luminosities than the cgcg galaxies located in the same area of the sky , they are , on average , _ higher _ in luminosity than either of the previous two h@xmath0-selected kiss lists . the median m@xmath44 values for kr1 and kr2 are @xmath1718.96 and @xmath1718.64 , respectively .",
    "the apparent reason for the differences between the three lists is the relative paucity of lower redshift galaxies in the current survey . as mentioned above , the cetus and botes fields of the ndwfs exhibit very low numbers of galaxies at redshifts below 0.035 and 0.025 , respectively",
    "this is precisely where kiss is most sensitive to dwarf elgs . to be sure ,",
    "there are still plenty of low luminosity galaxies present in the current survey list .",
    "however , the fraction of the survey with m@xmath44 @xmath15 @xmath1718 is less than in both kr1 and kr2 .    at the high luminosity end ,",
    "the kiss elgs appear to be deficient in galaxies with luminosities above m@xmath46 ( m@xmath44 @xmath47 @xmath1720 ) . while the kiss elgs cover the same absolute magnitude range as the magnitude - limited cgcg galaxies , the proportion of higher luminosity galaxies is much lower among the kiss galaxies .",
    "this most likely occurs for two reasons .",
    "first , the kiss sample is redshift limited at high luminosities , meaning that it does not probe arbitrarily large volumes of space for the highest luminosity objects as magnitude - limited samples do .",
    "second , the detection of any galaxy by kiss requires that the emission line observed be bright enough to stand out against the stellar continuum of the galaxy in the objective - prism spectrum .",
    "that is , there must be a minimum contrast between the continuum and the line .",
    "this is effectively an equivalent width limit . for luminous galaxies , a larger star - forming event or a stronger level of agn activity",
    "is needed for the emission lines to exceed this implicit equivalent width threshold .",
    "since these intense activity levels are fairly rare , there are fewer detected elgs among the higher luminosity host galaxies .",
    "the combination of these two effects means that there are fewer kiss elgs at luminosities above m@xmath46 .",
    "table [ table : tab2 ] lists cross - references for kiss elgs which are also cataloged in previous photographic surveys for active and star - forming galaxies , and we note the ugc numbers for the objects that are listed in the _ uppsala general catalogue of galaxies _ ( nilson , 1973 ) . the first red survey area overlapped with four major active galaxy surveys : markarian ( 1967 ) , case ( pesch & sanduleak 1983 ) , wasilewski ( 1983 ) , and ucm ( zamorano _ etal . _",
    "the third red survey area , like kr2 , overlaps with only the markarian and case surveys .",
    "the markarian survey overlaps both the botes and cetus fields .",
    "there are , however , no markarian galaxies in either field .",
    "this is not too surprising , since the surface density of markarian galaxies is small ( 0.1 per sq .",
    "the case survey overlaps only with the botes field , and there are 18 case objects in this area .",
    "however , two of them lie just outside the area covered by the kiss objective - prism images .",
    "they are both included in the kiss direct images , but as we mention in  2 , the spectral and direct images do not always cover the exact same area .",
    "two additional case objects ( 459 and 460 ) are emission regions within the same galaxy , and we choose to count them as one object for the purpose of the comparison with kiss . of the resulting 15 case objects , 13 ( 87% )",
    "are recovered by kiss in the main survey ( i.e. , table 2 ) .",
    "this fraction of recovered objects is somewhat higher than what was found for the first two red surveys ( 73% and 72% respectively ) . both of the two case galaxies that kiss does not recover",
    "are listed as color - selected in the case survey papers . neither",
    "one is listed in the secondary kiss survey list with 4@xmath14 to 5@xmath14 elg candidates .",
    "a large fraction of case galaxies have h@xmath0 lines with equivalent widths less than 30   ( salzer _ etal . _  1995 ) , and kiss is not as sensitive to this type of object .",
    "the ugc catalog overlaps with the botes field , and there are eight ugc galaxies in this area .",
    "four of them are also kiss galaxies .",
    "weak emission lines appear to be present in the objective - prism spectra of the remaining four galaxies , but only at the @xmath133@xmath14 level .",
    "we present the third list of h@xmath0-selected emission - line galaxy candidates ( and fourth list overall ) from the kpno international spectroscopic survey ( kiss ) . all data presented here were obtained with the 0.61-m burrell schmidt telescope .",
    "kiss is an objective - prism survey , but differs from older such surveys by virtue of the fact that it utilizes a ccd as the detector .",
    "while we sacrifice areal coverage relative to classical photographic surveys , we benefit from the enormous gain in sensitivity that ccds provide over plates .",
    "we readily detect strong - lined elgs as faint as b = 21 .",
    "in addition , the pan - chromatic nature of ccds allows us greater wavelength agility compared to photographic surveys . even with the use of our survey filter , which restricts the detection of elgs to z @xmath47 0.095 , we are sensitive to a broader range of galaxian redshifts than the older photographic objective - prism surveys ( paper i ) .",
    "the combination of higher sensitivity , lower noise , and larger volumes surveyed yield huge improvements in the depth of the resulting survey . with the kissrx objects",
    "included , kiss finds @xmath15200 times more agn and starburst galaxy candidates per unit area than did the markarian ( 1967 ) survey , and @xmath1337 times more than the ucm survey ( zamorano _ etal . _",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the current installment of kiss includes 261 elg candidates selected from 20 red survey fields covering a total of 19.65 deg@xmath8 .",
    "this yields a surface density of 13.3 galaxies per deg@xmath8 .",
    "we are sensitive to the h@xmath0 emission line with redshifts up to @xmath130.10 .",
    "the survey fields presented here are located at ra = 14@xmath2  30@xmath3 , @xmath4 = 34@xmath5  30@xmath6 ( b1950 ) , and at ra = 2@xmath2  7.5@xmath3 , @xmath4 = -4@xmath5  44@xmath6 .",
    "these fields were chosen to coincide with the location of the noao deep wide - field survey ( jannuzi & dey 1999 ) .",
    "for each object in the catalog we tabulate accurate equatorial coordinates , b & v photometry , and estimates of the redshift and line strength measured from the objective - prism spectra .",
    "we also provide finder charts and extracted spectral plots for all objects .",
    "in addition to the main survey list , we include a supplementary list of 158 elg candidates with weaker ( lower significance ) emission lines .",
    "this newest list brings the total of h@xmath0-selected kissr elgs to 2418 objects present in three survey regions .",
    "in addition , we have cataloged another 638  extra \" kissrx candidates that are detected in the survey with a lower significance level , the total number of cataloged elgs is 3056 , contained in a survey area of just 147.6 sq .",
    "the overall surface density of kiss elgs is thus 20.7 per sq .",
    "one of the advantages of our survey method is the large amount of basic data that we acquire for each object .",
    "this in turn allows us to parameterize the constituents of the survey and to develop a fairly complete picture of the overall sample without the need for extensive follow - up observations .",
    "we present an overview of the survey properties for the current list of elg candidates .",
    "the median apparent magnitude of the current sample is b  =  17.91 .",
    "this is somewhat brighter than the values found for kr1 and kr2 ( b = 18.08 and 18.13 , respectively ) , but it is still substantially fainter than previous elg surveys .",
    "objects fainter than b  =  20 are routinely cataloged .",
    "line strengths measured from the objective - prism spectra show that kiss is sensitive to objects with h@xmath0 + [ ] equivalent widths of less than 20  , and that most objects with ew @xmath15 40   are detected .",
    "the median emission - line flux of the kiss sample is nearly three times lower than that of the ucm survey ( gallego _ etal . _  1996 ) .",
    "the luminosity distribution of the kiss elgs is heavily weighted toward intermediate- and low - luminosity galaxies , although we are still sensitive to luminous agn and starbursting galaxies .",
    "the median absolute magnitude of m@xmath44 = @xmath1719.11 underscores the fact that strong - lined galaxies of the type cataloged by kiss tend to be less luminous than the types of objects found in more traditional magnitude - limited samples .    despite the fact that one can learn a great deal about each kiss elg from the survey data alone , it is still necessary to obtain higher dispersion follow - up spectra in order to arrive at a more complete understanding of each object .",
    "for example , due to the low - dispersion nature of the objective - prism spectra it is not possible to distinguish between agn and star - formation activity in the kiss galaxies .",
    "further , the redshifts derived from the kiss spectral data are too coarse to be used in detailed spatial distribution studies .",
    "we have obtained follow - up spectra for 100% of kiss elgs in the kr1 and kb1 survey lists , and we are in the process of obtaining spectra for the objects in the remaining survey lists ( kr2 and the current list .",
    "these follow - up spectra will allow us to better assess the nature of the individual galaxies , which in turn enables the sample to be used for a wide variety of science applications , many of which are outlined in paper i. examples include a series of multi - wavelength studies of the properties of kiss elgs in the radio ( van duyne _ etal . _  2004 ) and x - rays ( stevenson _ etal . _  2002",
    ", datta _ etal .",
    "_  2006 , in preparation ) , plus studies currently underway in the mid- and far - ir ( iras and spitzer ) and near - ir ( 2mass ) , as well as ongoing studies of the metal abundances in kiss star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , lee _ etal .",

    "we gratefully acknowledge financial support for the kiss project through nsf presidential faculty award to jjs ( nsf - ast-9553020 ) , which was instrumental in initiating the original international collaboration , as well as continued support via nsf - ast-0071114 and nsf - ast-0307766 .",

    "finally , we wish to thank the astronomy department of case western reserve university for maintaining the burrell schmidt during the period of time when the survey observations reported here were obtained .",
    "as we explained in section 3 , the main survey objects are selected based on the presence of a 5@xmath14 emission feature in their spectra . because of the high sensitivity of the survey data , many objects were detected that have apparent emission lines with strengths that are only slightly weaker than the 5@xmath14 limit .",
    "we decided to exclude such objects from the main survey list since one of the primary goals of the kiss project is to construct a deep but statistically complete sample of elgs .",
    "early tests involving follow - up spectroscopy carried out on fields where objects were selected to lower thresholds showed that 5@xmath14 detections were nearly always real sources , while objects between 4@xmath14 and 5@xmath14 tended to be real but also included a fair number ( @xmath1325% ) of spurious sources .",
    "however , these objects are nonetheless valid elg candidates , and this list of objects likely includes a number of interesting objects .",
    "therefore , rather than ignore these weaker - lined elg candidates entirely , we are publishing them in a supplementary table .",
    "listed in table [ table : tab3 ] are 158 elg candidates that have emission lines detected at between the 4@xmath14 and 5@xmath14 level .",
    "the format of table [ table : tab3 ] is the same as for table [ table : tab2 ] , except that the objects are now labeled with kissrx numbers ( ` x ' for extra ) .",
    "the kissrx numbers start at 481 since we presented 480 kissrx objects in kr1 and kr2 .",
    "the full version of the table , as well as finder charts for all 158 kissrx galaxies , are available in the electronic version of the paper .",
    "the supplementary elg sample has characteristics similar to those of the main survey elgs , although with some notable differences .",
    "the median h@xmath0 equivalent width is 40.9  , roughly 20% lower than the value for the main sample .",
    "the kissrx galaxies are somewhat fainter ( median b magnitude of 18.65 ) and significantly redder ( median b@xmath17v = 0.81 ) .",
    "their median redshift is slightly higher than that of either the botes or cetus field ( 0.067 ) , and their median luminosity is nearly a magnitude fainter ( @xmath1718.23 ) .",
    "hence , the supplementary elg list appears to be dominated by intermediate luminosity galaxies with somewhat lower rates of star - formation activity ( lower equivalent widths , redder colors ) than the elgs in the main sample .",
    "the differences between the kissr and kissrx objects in the current paper are similar to those seen between the two samples in kr1 and kr2 .",

    "<S> a total of 261 candidate emission - line objects have been selected for inclusion in the survey list ( 13.3 per deg@xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we tabulate accurate coordinates and photometry for each source , as well as estimates of the redshift , emission - line flux and line equivalent width based on measurements of the digital objective - prism spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the kiss elgs are examined using the available observational data . when combined with the wealth of multi - wavelength data already available for the ndwfs fields , </S>",
    "<S> the current list of kiss elgs should provide a valuable tool for studying star - formation and nuclear activity in galaxies in the local universe . </S>"
