    "identifying the primary electron donors and dominating charge - separation pathways has been a question of recent extensive research and debate . at the moment",

    ", we will answer this question via numerical simulation for the current and power as well as the robustness of the current and power against the charge recombination and dephasing .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a model of a quantum heat engine inspired by psii rc to describe the charge separation , which includes a second pathway in comparison with the model proposed in @xcite . a master equation describing the evolution of the two - pathway system",

    "@xmath10 , a special pair of coupled chlorophylls , is located at the center of the psii rc .",
    "they contribute mostly to the lowest energy states and are the primary electron donors , forming two exciton states which are denoted as @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "these two pairs of molecules are also coupled to the accessory chlorophylls @xmath13 and @xmath14 located in the two different branches @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the remaining two pheophytin pigments coupled to the rest of the molecules , and act as the electron acceptors .",
    "photosynthetic antennae transfer energy of the absorbed solar photons to the rc where the transmembrane charge separation takes place .",
    "charge separation in the core of pigment - protein rc complexes is the first energy conversion step in photosynthesis .",
    "the consequent electrochemical potential drives a chain of chemical reactions , including the reduction of nadp to nadph , the synthesis of atp and the oxidized part of the rc splits water , releasing molecular oxygen , all these leading eventually to the stable storage of solar energy .",
    "the photosynthetic reaction center may be analyzed as a biological quantum heat engine(bqhe ) that transforms high - energy thermal photon radiation into low - entropy electron flux .",

    "and @xmath20 describes the ionized state in which the system is positively charged ( the excited electron is assumed to have been used to perform work ) .",
    "the heat engine cycle begins with the excited electron promoted from @xmath17 to @xmath11 and/or @xmath12 after the absorption of a solar photon .",

    "[ structureme : ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the electron can be released from state @xmath24 with a rate @xmath25 , resulting in a current from @xmath22 to @xmath20 driving a chain of chemical reactions , leading eventually to the stable storage of solar energy .",
    "the current @xmath26 is thus determined by the relaxation rate @xmath25 and the population of @xmath19 .",

    "we also assume that the donor excited states @xmath18 and @xmath12 undergo a dephasing process ( via a rate @xmath30 ) , which will influence the current and power generated .",
    "this model including one charge - separation pathway ( @xmath31 ) can exhibit noise - induced quantum coherence due to fano interference , which originates from the coupling of two levels to a common reservoir and thus the effect can be revealed by the cross - couplings .",
    "fano interference can minimize the acceptor - to - donor charge recombination by inducing coherence between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this brings about enhanced current and power output as we will show in section ii .    although electron transfer in the psii rc has been thoroughly investigated and several charge - separation pathways that involve the formation of several different radical pairs were identified , works on the effect of multiple charge - separation pathways are rarely found . at the moment , much evidence shows that two main pathways make significant contributions under ambient conditions @xcite .",
