    "extragalactic blank - field submm surveys have been carried out since the advent of scuba ( holland 1999 ) more than a decade ago , and have provided us with a unique view of intense , dust - cloaked star formation events at high redshifts ( e.g.  blain et al .",
    "yet such observations have so far only pin - pointed the most luminous high-@xmath37 galaxies , due to the limitations in sensitivity and resolution imposed by preset - day ( sub)mm facilities .",
    "it is now well - established that the bright ( @xmath38mjy at 850-@xmath0 m ) submm sources uncovered by these surveys primarily reside in the redshift range @xmath39 ( chapman et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) , and account for @xmath40 percent of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) at 850-@xmath0 m ( barger et al .  1998 , 1999 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; coppin et al .  2006 ) . surveys that make use of galaxy clusters gravitational amplification of the background source plane have uncovered a number of faint ( @xmath41mjy ) sources and resolved up to 80 per - cent of the background ( smail et al .",
    "1997 , 2002a ; blain et al .  1999 ; cowie et al .  2002 ; chapman et al .  2002 ; knudsen et al .",
    ". however , we know little about the nature and redshift distribution ( smail et al.1997 , 2002a ) of the population below @xmath42mjy due in part to the difficulty of identifying counterparts in the radio .",
    "the recent advent of large format near - ir cameras have revealed populations of moderately star forming galaxies at @xmath43 that are more numerous than the ( sub)mm selected systems , and more representative of the bulk population at these epochs ( e.g.  cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; lawrence et al .",
    "the rest - frame near - ir is arguably the best wavelength range to undertake such surveys at  as , in comparison with uv and optical surveys , it is less sensitive to the effects of age and dust on the stellar population , and thus more closely provides a selection based on stellar mass .",
    "well known examples of near - ir colour - selected galaxies are the populations of extremely red objects ( eros  elston , rieke & rieke 1988 , mccarthy , persson & west 1992 ; hu & ridgway 1994 ) , distant red galaxies ( drgs  franx et al.2003 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the so - called bzk galaxies ( daddi et al.2004 ) .",
    "while these populations are selected according to different optical / near - ir colour criteria applied , which pick out systems at different , but overlapping , redshift ranges .",
    "these colour criteria are often designed to straddle the 4000  break ( including the balmer break at 3646 ) , characteristic of evolved , metal - enriched galaxies that are old enough that ob - stars do not dominate the light . the same colour criteria , however , will also select dusty , starforming galaxies at virtually any redshift .",
    "thus , near - ir colour - selected galaxy populations are typically a mix of actively star forming galaxies and old , evolved systems , which means additional colour criteria and/or spectral analysis has to be applied in order to separate the two .",
    "clearly , submm observations offer a unique way of distinguishing between starforming and passive near - ir galaxies .    at present",
    ", however , the bulk of near - ir colour - selected galaxies are too faint for individual detection by large format ( sub)mm surveys , and for the moment , therefore , the only way forward is to study their average ( sub)mm / far - ir properties by means of stacking techniques .",
    "a handful of such studies have been carried out to date , characterizing the average submm signal of near - ir selected galaxies and their contribution to the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) at submm wavelengths ( webb et al .",
    "2004 ; daddi et al .  2005 ; knudsen et al .",
    "2005 ; takagi et al .",
    "yet most of these stacking analyses have been of relatively small samples of galaxies , and as a consequence have had to averaging their submm properties over the entire redshift range from which they are selected ( which is often substantial , @xmath44 ) .",
    "a robust delineation of the submm signal of near - ir selected galaxies as a function of redshifts has therefore been lacking , and as a consequence we do not know how the dust - enshrouded starformation in these galaxies evolve with cosmic epoch .    the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdf - s ) , a @xmath45 region centered on the smaller goods - s / cdf - s field ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) , is one of the most intensively studied extragalactic fields in the southern sky .",
    "in addition to x - ray observations with chandra ( alexander et al.2003 ; lehmer et al .  2005 ; luo et al .",
    "2008 ) , the edcf - s has been targeted in a large number of optical and near - ir filter passbands from the ground as part of combo-17 ( wolf et al .",

    "the mapping pattern was chosen to give a uniform coverage across a @xmath49 area centered at ra : @xmath50 dec @xmath51 ( j2000 ) .",
    "mapping was performed alternating rectangular on - the - fly scans with raster of spiral patterns . for the latter mode the telescope traces in two scans spirals with radii between @xmath52 and @xmath53 at 16 and 9 positions ( the raster ) spaced by 600  in azimuth and elevation .",
    "the scanning speed was typically between 2 - 3 arcmin per second .",
    "calibration was achieved through observations of mars , uranus and neptune as well as secondary calibrators and was found to be accurate within 8.5% .",
    "the atmospheric attenuation was determined via skydips every @xmath54 2 hours as well as from independent data from the apex radiometer which measures the line of sight water vapor column every minute .",
    "focus settings were typically determined once per night and checked during sunrise .",

    "[ figure : nz ] ) , but their low average submm fluxes implies a @xmath452 contribution to the submm ebl .    the bulk ( @xmath453 ) of the contribution to the submm ebl from 24-@xmath0 m detected ( i.e.  @xmath454jy ) sbzk ,",
    "ero and drg galaxies comes from sources with @xmath455jy , with only a minor fraction coming from brighter , presumably , agn - dominated sources .",
    "the sbzk and pbzk selections are designed to locate star forming and passive galaxies in the redshift range @xmath456 , while the ero and drg colour criteria are designed to select extremely red ( either due to dust extinction or old age ) galaxies at @xmath35 .",
    "still , the exact definitions of these colour criteria are somewhat arbitrary . given the large number of sources available to us , we are in a position to construct stacks of the 870-@xmath0 m signal from statistically significant subsets of galaxies across the bzk and rjk diagrams , thus allowing us to see where in these colour - colour diagrams the submm signal is coming from .",
    "ultimately , this may allow us to fine - tune the sbzk / pbzk criteria , as well as potentially identify regions of the rjk - diagram containing dusty / starforming vs.  old / passive eros and drgs .            in fig .",
    "[ figure : bzk_stack ] and [ figure : rjk_stack ] we show the signal- and @xmath281-contours of the stacked 870-@xmath0 m signal obtained across the bzk- and rjk - diagrams , where the stacking has been carried out within equally sized grid - cells .",
    "we have done this for the full sample , as well as for subsets of the sample within the redshift intervals @xmath457 , @xmath458 , and @xmath459 .",
    "these intervals were motivated by the redshift distributions in fig .",
    "[ figure : nz ] , which showed evidence of distinct populations between @xmath458 and @xmath459 .    considering fig .",
    "[ figure : bzk_stack]a first , we see that the sbzk criterion by daddi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) seems to be robust in the sense that the bulk of the 870-@xmath0 m signal is emerging from the sbzk region . comparing with fig.[figure",
    ": cc - diagram]a indicates that virtually the entire submm signal is coming from the subset of sbzk galaxies ( with a slight overlap into the pbzk and non - bzk regions ) , which have also been classified as eros . due to their extremely red colours and relatively strong submm signal ,",
    "these galaxies are very likely to be amongst the most dusty , star forming sources of the submm - faint @xmath1 selected galaxies , yet their brightness ensures that they are detected in the blue ( thus qualifying as sbzk galaxies ) .",
    "the submm signal clearly extends into the pbzk region suggesting that some contamination by star forming galaxies occurs .",
    "this is partly due the low density of sources in the pbzk - region which implies that more sources will scatter into the region ( due to photometric errors ) than out of it .",
    "based on the 870-@xmath0 m signal and @xmath281 contours in fig .",
    "[ figure : bzk_stack ] , we propose a refinement of the sbzk and pbzk criteria , namely @xmath460 for sbzks , and @xmath461 for pbzks .    that these refined selection criteria might do a better job at selecting starforming and passive bzk galaxies , is confirmed if we consider how the submm signal across the bzk - diagram changes with redshift ( fig .",
    "[ figure : bzk_stack]c - h ) .",
    "we find that only marginal 870-@xmath0 m emission emerges from galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath457 , while in the @xmath462 interval , significant submm emission ( @xmath463mjy ) starts to appear from galaxies lying within the sbzk region . at @xmath464 a strong submm signal ( @xmath465mjy ) and",
    "nearly all of the submm emission is coming from the sbzk region .",
    "this observed migration of the stacked submm signal towards the sbzk region as a function of redshift , illustrates the ability of the sbzk - criterion to select starforming galaxies at @xmath466 .    turning to the rjk - diagram",
    ", the bulk of the submm - signal is found to come from the overlap region between drgs and eros , in particular from ero / drg galaxies with @xmath467 .",
    "the latter , together with the tentative evidence of an underdensity of sources at @xmath468 ( see fig .  [",
    "figure : cc - diagram ] ) , suggests that @xmath469 may be a useful criterion for selecting a dusty , starforming galaxies .",
    "this is strengthened by the fact that the submm signal becomes even stronger and further concentrated towards the ero / drg overlap region if we consider only the subset of sources at @xmath470 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : rjk_stack]g - h ) . in the redshift range @xmath458 ,",
    "the submm signal is much weaker ( @xmath463mjy ) and comes from ero / drg galaxies with @xmath471 .",
    "it is well - known that the @xmath472 ero population is a heterogeneous population , consisting of roughly a fifty - fifty mix of dusty , star forming eros and evolved , passive eros ( spinrad et al .  1999 ; dey et al .  1999 ;",
    "cimatti et al .  1999 ; mannucci et al .",
    "pozzetti & mannucci ( 2000 ) argued that a crude separation between the two types of eros could be made based on the criterion @xmath473 ( and @xmath474 ) , with dusty , star forming eros lying above the relation and old , passive eros below it .",
    "while our stacking analysis lends some merit to the pozzetti & mannucci criterion , as the bulk of the submm signal is clearly found above it , significant submm emission is also detected in the passive ero region ( in particular for sources at @xmath475 ) , suggesting that blindly applying the criterion does not produce clean samples of starforming and passive eros ( see also smail et al .",
    "2002b ) .",
    "finally , we caution that by adopting equally sized grid cells , some cells will contain a significantly larger number of sources than others , thereby introducing a potential skewing of the measured @xmath281 across the diagrams ( which is why we also show the variation of the average submm flux density across the diagrams ) . as a check on our results",
    ", we therefore adopted two alternative methods for binning the sources .",
    "first , an adaptive mesh was applied by requiring that no more than 200 sources were allowed within a given cell , and , secondly , the 50 nearest neighbours of each source were identified and stacked .",
    "reassuringly , the two additional binning methods gave results in good agreement with the regular grid results .",
    "using the apex / laboca 870-@xmath0 m map of the ecdf - s ( wei  et al .  2009 ) along with the publically available musyc survey data of this field ( taylor et al.2008 ) , we have performed a submm stacking analysis of 8266 @xmath62-band selected ( @xmath1 ) galaxies , as well as subsets of 737 drg , 1253 ero , and 744/149 sbzk / pbzk galaxies .",
    "photometric redshifts have been derived for the full @xmath1 sample using @xmath56 data from musyc , thereby allowing us to study stacked submm flux densities as a function of redshift .",
    "this represents the largest submm stacking analyses of near - ir selected galaxies to date .",
    "the main results are summarized below : + @xmath476 we measure stacked 870-@xmath0 m signals of @xmath2mjy ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4mjy ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath6mjy ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8mjy ( @xmath9 ) for the @xmath1 , bzk , ero and drg samples , respectively . splitting the bzk galaxies up into star - forming ( sbzk ) and passive ( pbzk ) galaxies , the former",
    "is significantly detected ( @xmath477mjy , @xmath14 ) while the latter , as expected , is not ( @xmath15mjy , @xmath16 ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath1 galaxies are responsible for @xmath478% of the ebl at 870-@xmath0 m .",
    "sbzk galaxies , eros and drgs ( brighter than @xmath1 ) are found to contribute @xmath479 of the 870-@xmath0 m background each .",
    "+ @xmath476 performing the stacking analysis in redshift bins , it is found that the stacked submm signal from @xmath1 galaxies , as well as the ero and drg sub - samples , is coming from sources in the redshift range @xmath480 , while for bzk galaxies the signal remains constant with redshift . assessing the contribution to the submm ebl from the different samples as a function of redshift",
    "is complicated by the fact that these are flux - limited samples , although , we can conclude that the bulk of the submm light from @xmath1 galaxies comes from sources at @xmath481 .",
    "+ @xmath476 we find a linear correlation between stacked submm flux and 24-@xmath0 m flux density for sbzk , ero and drg galaxies with @xmath482jy .",
    "this correlation suggests that the 24-@xmath0 m emission from @xmath483jy galaxies is dominated by star formation , and consequently can be used as a robust tracer of star formation . at @xmath484jy",
    "we find that the stacked 870-@xmath0 m flux density becomes constant ( @xmath485 ) and independent of @xmath486 , which is likely due to agn starting to contribute significantly to the 24-@xmath0 m as well as 870-@xmath0 m emission .",
    "+ @xmath476 in an effort to isolate a subset of bzk , ero , and drg galaxies responsible for the bulk of the stacked 870-@xmath0 m emission we have measured the significance of the stacked submm signal across the bzk and rjk diagrams , identifying the regions of strongest submm emission . we find that the stacked submm signal from submm - faint sbzk galaxies is dominated by the subset of sources which also fulfill the ero criterion .",
    "these are likely to be dusty , starforming galaxies , which are sufficiently bright in the blue to be selected as sbzk galaxies .",
    "the majority of these sources are found in the redshift range @xmath470 , in line with the bzk - selection criterion proposed by daddi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . guided by the stacked submm - contours we propose slightly modified bzk - selection criteria , namely @xmath487 for sbzks , and @xmath488 for pbzks .    in the rjk - diagram",
