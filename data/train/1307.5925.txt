    "unlike charmonia and bottomonia which have been thoroughly investigated from both experimental and theoretical aspects , the researches on @xmath12 and its excited states are far behind because of lack of necessary data for a long while .",
    "the luminosity of lep i and ii was not sufficient to produce @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13the ground state of the meson family which contains two different heavy flavors was eventually observed at hadron colliders . until now @xmath12",
    "is still only measured at tevatron and lhc . in the future proposed @xmath14 and/or higgs factories or even ilc with very high",
    "luminosity will produce a large database of @xmath12 and their excite states which can provide more accurate information about the two - heavy - flavor measons .",
    "charmonia and bottomonia mainly decay via strong and electromagnetic interactions , instead @xmath12 can decay only via weak interaction , therefore its lifetime is much longer than the quarkonia . even though lhc is a hadron collider ,",
    "the background is much messier than at electron - positron colliders , because of its high energy and luminosity , lhc offers us an opportunity to study @xmath12 and its excited states .",
    "recently lhc@xmath0 collaboration has measured several decay modes of @xmath12 and obtained @xmath15@xcite ; @xmath16@xcite ; @xmath17 and @xmath18@xcite . it would be a good time to carry out serious theoretical studies on those decay modes which may provide us more information about the structure of such two - heavy - flavor mesons and especially serve as a probe for our models which deal with the non - perturbative qcd .",
    "though the typical @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote a pseudoscalar meson and a vector meson respectively ) transitions have been studied by various approaches@xcite , the theoretical predictions on @xmath12 are few . in ref.@xcite cheng et al . studied @xmath19 transitions in the light front quark model ( lfqm ) which has been established and applied by many researchers later @xcite . in this work",
    "we will apply the formula derived by cheng et al . in ref.@xcite to study the semi - leptonic decay @xmath22 and non - leptonic decay @xmath23 ( @xmath24 can be @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . hopefully we can further test the validity degree of the lfqm and constrain the model parameter space .    in lfqm a phenomenological wave function is introduced to describe the momentum distribution amplitudes of the constituent quarks and the harmonic oscillator wave functions may be the most convenient and applicable one among all possible forms .",
    "most of the previous studies only explored the transitions between ground states . in our early work",
    "@xcite we calculated the decay constants of @xmath27 ( excited states of bottomonia ) with the traditional harmonic oscillator wave functions and found that the theoretical results obviously conflict with data , so we proposed to choose a modified harmonic oscillator wave function instead for the radially excited states . with this change",
    ", the inconsistency between theoretical predictions and data disappears . in this work",
    "we would like to further check the modified harmonic oscillator wave functions for radially excited state in @xmath6 weak decays . comparing the theoretical results with data",
    "one can judge whether the modified harmonic oscillator wave functions work better than the traditional ones .",
    "after the introduction we present the relevant formulas for @xmath19 transition in section ii where we introduce briefly our modified harmonic oscillator wavefuncions",
    ". then we numerically evaluate the form factors and the decay widths for the available decay modes and predict the rates for some channels which have not been measured yet . in the section",

    "we also define @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite these form factors are calculated in the space - like region with @xmath35 , thus to obtain the physical amplitudes an extension to the time - like region is needed . to make the extension one may write out an analytical expressions for the form factors , and in ref.@xcite a three - parameter form",

    "ccc      for calculating the form factors @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath21 , the light - front momentum distribution amplitudes need to be specified . in most of such works ,",
    "the harmonic oscillator wave function is employed because of its obvious advantages . in our previous",
    "work@xcite we found that predictions on the rates of the processes where radially excited states are involved do not coincides with data as long as the transitional harmonic oscillator wave function was employed , thus we suggested to use a modified harmonic oscillator wave function to replace the traditional one for the radially excited states .",
    "it is found that the modified wave function indeed works well when we calculate the radiative decays of @xmath40 .",
    "the decay of @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a radially excited state would serve as an alternative probe for testing the modified wave function .",
    "thus we use both the traditional and modified harmonic oscillator wave functions to calculate the rates of @xmath43 where @xmath24 denotes some relevant mesons . through comparing the results obtained in terms of the two kinds of @xmath42 wave function with data",

    "we fixed @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 and by the heavy quark effective theory it is reasonable to suppose that they are the same for @xmath42 .      since no strong interaction in the final states to contaminate the processes",

    "all the predictions will be tested by future experiments at lhcb or other facilities such as the planned ilc or @xmath14 , higgs factories etc . since the parameter @xmath45 in the wave function of @xmath12",
    "is obtained by an interpolation between the values for @xmath66 and @xmath69 , it is not accurate , thus the obtained values of the widths listed in table [ tab : t3 ] may change for different @xmath45 values , however the ratio between two widths would not vary much because the effect caused by the uncertainty of @xmath45 is partly compensated in the ratios .",
    "in this paper we calculate the weak decays @xmath92 and @xmath93 within the light - front quark model .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "the first is to check the validity and applicability of the modified harmonic oscillator wave function for radially excited states of heavy quarkonia which we derived in our earlier work by fitting data of different processes .",
    "secondly , we further investigate the model parameters which were fixed by fitting the data of charmonia and bottomonia decays .",
    "namely , by comparing our predictions on the rates of several decay modes of @xmath92 and @xmath93 which are the measured channels , with the available data , the consistency degree confirms the reasonable range of the model parameters . then with those model parameters , we go on predicting the rates for the channels which have not been measured yet .",
    "the predictions will be tested by the future experiments .",
    "for such @xmath19 transitions the form factors were deduced by several authors @xcite . with the form factors we evaluate the rates for semi - leptonic and non - leptonic decays of @xmath12 . though there is uncertainty for the value of @xmath45 in the wave function of @xmath12 , the theoretically evaluated ratios @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are consistent with data within only 1@xmath10 . the rates of other decays of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are also calculated which will be experimentally measured soon and by then we can fix or extract some parameters including the value of @xmath45 for @xmath12 .    in ref.@xcite we suggested a modified harmonic oscillator wave function for the radially excited states in lfqm . using these modified wave functions the obtained decay constants of @xmath97 are in good agreement with the data and we also checked the applicability of these wave functions in the radiative decays of @xmath97 . in this work",
    "we calculate the transition @xmath4 with the traditional and modified wave functions for @xmath42 .",
    "the theoretical results are quite different when the two wave functions are employed , as the ratios are @xmath98 and @xmath99 and the result using the modified wave function is closer to the data @xmath100 .",
    "namely , our numerical results which are satisfactorily consistent with data of @xmath101 , indicate that the modified wave function works better than the traditional one not only for the radially excited bottomonia , but also for radially excited charmonia .",
