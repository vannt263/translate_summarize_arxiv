    "in earlier work we studied the effect of inertia on laminar swimming and flying of an assembly of rigid spheres in an incompressible viscous fluid @xcite . the spheres were assumed to interact directly via central forces , and hydrodynamic interactions were calculated from low reynolds number hydrodynamics @xcite and the theory of potential flow @xcite .",
    "it turned out that in a wide range of dimensionless viscosity the swimming is similar to that found in the stokes regime where friction dominates @xcite . in the following we extend our study on the basis of an explicit expression for the asymptotic periodic swimming velocity .",
    "the scallop theorem valid in the stokes regime @xcite shows that a body consisting of two spheres , immersed in a viscous fluid and in slow relative oscillatory motion along the connecting axis , does not swim .",
    "it was recently found by klotsa et al . in experiment and computer simulation",
    "@xcite that such a body does swim for fast relative motion , provided the spheres are not identical .",
    "this occurs in the inertial regime , where mass effects dominate .    for the model with point hydrodynamic interactions",
    "we find a non - vanishing mean swimming velocity for the two - sphere system , even though the mean impetus vanishes .",
    "however , the transition seen in experiment @xcite is beyond the scope of the present theory . apparently , for a sufficiently large value of the streaming reynolds number a new mechanism sets in with a transcritical bifurcation type instability @xcite , leading to effective swimming in the inertial regime .",
    "it is of interest to study the effects of inertia on swimming outside the stokes regime , but before the transition .",
    "the stokes regime corresponds to the swimming of microorganisms .",
    "many small organisms occurring in nature will fit the intermediate regime considered here .",
    "the two - sphere system with collinear motion is of theoretical interest , but it does not swim at all in the stokes regime and is fairly inefficient when inertial effects are taken into account . we investigate also the effects of inertia on the swimming of a collinear three - sphere chain .",
    "this extends earlier work in the stokes regime @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the analysis suggests that the theory can be applied also to more complicated sphere models with realistic hydrodynamic interactions .    in sec .",
    "ii we derive the general expression for the asymptotic periodic swimming velocity in the discrete sphere model .",
    "the expression demonstrates that inertia leads to an after - effect in the relation between swimming velocity and impetus @xcite , whereas in the stokes regime the relation is instantaneous . as a consequence ,",
    "the swimming velocity depends significantly on the mass densities of spheres and fluid .    in the intermediate regime , where both friction and inertia are relevant",
    ", the swimming velocity depends in a remarkably complicated fashion on the amplitude and period of the stroke . on the other hand",
    ", the present work shows that the numerical dependence on parameters and amplitude is fairly simple for both the two - sphere swimmer and the three - sphere chain .",

    "the fluid flow velocity @xmath6 and pressure @xmath7 are assumed to satisfy the navier - stokes equations and the flow velocity is assumed to satisfy the no - slip boundary condition at the surface of each sphere .",
    "the spheres interact via central direct interaction forces which depend only on the relative distances @xmath8 of sphere centers , and they are acted upon by forces @xmath9 oscillating in time with period @xmath10 and directed along the @xmath2 axis , so that @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , we require that at any time the applied forces sum to zero , so that the total force acting on the assembly vanishes .",
    "if the spheres are initially at rest and located on the @xmath2 axis , then by symmetry they will remain on the axis , so that it suffices to consider the @xmath2 coordinates of the centers .",
    "we are interested in the asymptotic periodic motion of the center @xmath12 the swimming velocity is defined as @xmath13 at long times .",
    "its average over a period at long times defines the mean swimming velocity @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that at any time the hydrodynamic interactions between the spheres can be described approximately by a @xmath15 friction matrix @xmath16 , which can be evaluated from the steady state stokes equations , and by a @xmath15 mass matrix @xmath17 , which can be evaluated from potential flow theory .",
