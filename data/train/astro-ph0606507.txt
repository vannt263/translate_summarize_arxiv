    "the european neutrino telescope experiments @xcite have joined their efforts in the km3net project @xcite to design a @xmath0-scale deep - sea neutrino telescope in the mediterranean .",
    "a neutrino telescope of these dimensions on the northern hemisphere , complementary to icecube @xcite , is necessary for high - energy neutrino astronomy .    as a first step for the km3net project ,",
    "a detailed simulation study of different detector models and photo - detectors is necessary .",
    "the software used by the antares collaboration , with some modifications , is flexible enough for this task and was used for this study .",
    "the modifications include the adaptation to a larger detector and a new causality filter for the event reconstruction @xcite .",
    "in addition some changes were necessary to implement the different photo - detection systems presented in this work .",
    "nonetheless the reconstruction and the selection cuts are optimized for antares , and are therefore not necessarily optimal for different detector designs .",
    "however as the results show similar efficiencies for the detector models studied in this work and for the antares detector , any reconstruction induced inefficiencies must be small .",
    "the event sample used contained @xmath1 muon neutrinos with energies distributed between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and incident isotropically from the whole solid angle .",
    "only charged - current @xmath4n interactions were simulated , and the hadronic component of the final state was neglected .",
    "a background rate of 91 hz per @xmath5 of photocathode area was used , corresponding to @xmath6 for a 10 \" photomultiplier .",
    "for comparison of different detector models the neutrino effective area was calculated as a function of the neutrino energy .",
    "the angular resolution , defined as the median angular deviation between reconstructed and true neutrino direction , was derived from the results , again as a function of energy .",
    "the different photomultiplier ( pm ) configurations ( storeys ) considered in this work are depicted in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "@xmath7 antares storey with 3 10 \" pms .    @xmath7 single cylinder with 35 3 \" pms , where each pm is read out individually .",
    "@xmath7 three smaller cylinders with 12 3 \" pms each , hits occuring in one of the sub - cylinders , within a predefined time window are added .",
    "the overall photocathode area of these structures is comparable .",
    "small pms generally have a higher quantum efficiency and a better transit time spread ( tts ) .",
    "+    a disadvantage of the single cylinder structure lies in its vulnerability to mechanical stability problems .",
    "additionally individual readout of 35 pms within a very confined space might not be feasible . therefore the triple cylinder variant was proposed . by adding hits in one sub - cylinder the amount of necessary readout electronics is reduced considerably .     +    for comparison these photodetector units where placed in a cubic kilometer grid with a string and storey distance of @xmath8 ( 4913 storeys ) .",
    "effective areas calculated for these detectors are shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "obviously the single cylinder storey is superior at energies below @xmath9 .",
    "the reconstruction requires a certain minimal number of pm hits , a fact that is especially important at low energies , where the number of signal hits is very low . in the single cylinders",
    "the high number of individual hits explains the good low - energy efficiency .    at energies between one and a few hundred tev , the single and triple cylinder storeys are comparable and both superior to the antares storey . for the single cylinder",
    "this can again be explained by a larger number of hits .",
    "the reason in case of the triple cylinder is the requirement of local coincidences in one storey and/or hits with high amplitudes .",
    "coincident hits in one of the triple cylinders are added and therefore transformed into a high amplitude hit .",
    "the angular resolution is very similar for all three cases , with a common overall median of @xmath10 .",
    "the efficiency of a detector at low energies is correlated to the distance between the pms . a possible way to combine low- and",
    "high - energy performance is to use clusters of densely instrumented strings as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "low - energy muons have a high detection probability inside the clusters , while high - energy muons have a chance to hit several of the clusters , thus seeing a large instrumented volume .     +    as expected , effective area ( fig.[fig4 ] ) , and angular resolution ( fig.[fig5 ] ) are significantly better than for the cube at energies below @xmath11 . at higher energies",
    "the performance is about 20% worse .",
    "+     +    above approximately @xmath9 the muon range in water exceeds the dimensions of the instrumented volume of a @xmath0-scale detector .",
    "starting from this energy , most of the muons will enter the detector from the outside .",
    "therefore the cross section area of the detector starts to become more important than a densely instrumented volume .    in order to exploit this effect",
    "the design of a ring - shaped detector with a densely instrumented boundary was studied .",
    "examples of string layouts for such detectors are shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "+    effective areas for the rings , as shown in fig.[fig7 ] , are slightly higher at low energies , due to the denser storey spacing in the ring .",
    "the angular resolution is very similar to the homogeneous case .",
    "several promising concepts of pm configurations and geometries for the design of the mediterranean @xmath0 neutrino detector were considered .    through simulations",
    "it was shown that the use of many small pms in pressure cylinders can provide better performance as conventional large hemispherical pms .",
    "inhomogeneous geometries have been shown to increase efficiency at low energies with only small losses at high energies , while drastically reducing the number of necessary strings .",
    "the decision for a definite configuration has to depend on the physics priorities of the project , as the performance of the different detector concepts depends on the neutrino energy .",
    "further studies with dedicated software for a @xmath0-scale detector are absolutely necessary to further clarify the results presented here , since the software used for this work is optimized for the antares detector ."
