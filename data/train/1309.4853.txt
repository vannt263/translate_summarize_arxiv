    "cell membranes are composed of many different lipid species and exhibit both lateral heterogeneity @xcite and bilayer asymmetry in their lipid composition @xcite .",
    "while there have been many in - vitro studies of lateral phase segregation in multicomponent giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) @xcite and suspended membranes @xcite , it is only recently that attention has turned to membranes with asymmetric bilayers @xcite .",
    "one of the issues highlighted in these experiments and relevant to cell membrane biology , is the extent of correlation or registry of phase segregated domains in the two leaflets of the bilayer .",
    "this has inspired theoretical @xcite and coarse - grained computer simulation @xcite studies of _ bilayer registry _ of domains in asymmetric bilayers .",
    "a well studied multicomponent model system is the 3-component lipid mixture comprising an unsaturated lipid ( popc ) , a saturated lipid ( psm ) and cholesterol ( chol ) which exhibits liquid - ordered ( @xmath0 ) - liquid - disordered ( @xmath1 ) phase coexistence .",
    "since the extent of bilayer registry is likely to be sensitive to lipid chemistry , in this paper we study the transbilayer coupling and extent of bilayer registry of the phase domains across the membrane , using an atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of an asymmetric lipid bilayer membrane comprising popc / psm / chol .",
    "the registry of lipids across the bilayer suggest a mechanism by which outer leaflet lipids may couple with inner leaflet lipids and vice versa .",
    "this is important in the construction of membrane domains , and more generally in transducing information across the bilayer by lipidic receptors such as gpi - anchored proteins ( gpi - aps ) @xcite or glycolipids @xcite and other lipid species .",
    "our motivation for this work also comes from a series of experiments that study the spatial organization and dynamics of gpi - aps , on the surface of living cells .",
    "a variety of experimental strategies such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( fret ) @xcite , near - field microscopy ( nsom ) and electron microscopy , have revealed that both the organization and dynamics of the outer - leaflet gpi - aps are regulated by cholesterol , sphingolipids and _ cortical actin and myosin _ at the inner leaflet .",
    "the question is how do the outer - leaflet gpi - aps couple to cortical actin that abuts the inner leaflet of the cell membrane @xcite .",
    "since the interaction across the bilayer must be indirect , are there other lipids , such as cholesterol and sphingolipids , that are involved in this linkage ? do specific inner leaflet lipids that interact with actin , participate in this transbilayer coupling @xcite ?",
    "this naturally brings up the issue of bilayer registry in the cell membrane and its dependence on the specificity of lipids and its chemistry .",
    "we have been addressing these important issues using both experiments on live cells and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations on multicomponent model membranes composed of so - called ` raft - components ' @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows : we first describe the details of the atomistic molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of the 3-component bilayer .",
    "next we present our results on lateral compositional heterogeneity , extent of bilayer registry and mismatch area across the bilayer , as a function of the concentration of the saturated lipid ( psm ) .",
