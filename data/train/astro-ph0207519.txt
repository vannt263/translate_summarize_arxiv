    "the variation of the initial mass function ( imf ) with the environment is a key problem in star formation , but any dependence of the imf with the ambient conditions has been difficult to determine .",
    "most surveys have concentrated on the most compact regions with the highest density of stars and gas , while extended , sparse groups of nearby young stars have not been studied with the same sensitivity , mainly because of the large area of the sky that they span .",
    "therefore , meaningful comparisons of the imf in differing conditions have not been readily available .",
    "this situation is changing with the advent of large - format ccd detectors , making possible deep surveys of the less embeded , more extended star - forming complexes . with a modest extinction ( av @xmath2 ) and low density of stars",
    "( n@xmath3 pc@xmath4 ) taurus is an example of the `` non - clustered '' mode of star formation , making it an ideal laboratory for comparison with high density regions like young clusters .",
    "we used the 8k @xmath58k ccd mosaic camera with @xmath6 filters on the kpno 0.9 m telescope ( @xmath7 fov ) to observe eight fields in taurus to an @xmath8 . with @xmath6 photometry and @xmath9 data from the 2mass",
    ", we performed a reddening limited ( av@xmath2 ) search for candidate young ( @xmath10 myr ) low - mass stars and brown dwarfs down to @xmath11 ( details in briceo et al .",
    "we then used the k and na gravity - sensitive features in follow up spectra to confirm membership .    among the new members",
    "is an m9.5 brown dwarf ( figure 1a ) , the least massive object identified so far in taurus ( @xmath12 using the temperature scale of luhman [ 2000 ] and evolutionary tracks of baraffe et al . [ 1998 ] ) .",
    "this object exhibits significant near - ir excess and strong h@xmath13 emission ( w[h@xmath14=150$] ) , indicative of ongoing accretion from a circumstellar disk and evidence that brown dwarfs , like stars , can form from fragmentation processes .",
    "we construct an imf for our taurus fields and compare it with the imf for the trapezium cluster ( figure 1b ) .",
    "we find that the ratio of substellar to stellar objects in the trapezium is @xmath1 larger than in taurus ; the scarcity of brown dwarfs may be due to the higher value of the jeans mass in taurus , which results from the lower surface density of gas in this region ."
