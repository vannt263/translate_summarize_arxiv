    "questions concerning the nature of thermal fluctuations in fluids in thermal nonequilibrium states have been the subject of many studies during the past two decades .",
    "specifically , in this paper we consider thermal fluctuations in a horizontal layer of a one - component fluid that is heated either from above or from below in such a way that the fluid is still in a stable convection - free state .",
    "a number of different and independent approaches for dealing with various aspects of this problem have appeared in the literature .",
    "most of the earlier studies focused on the nonequilibrium fluctuations close to the convective rayleigh - bnard instability because of their possible influence on the pattern - selection process when convection appears  @xcite .",
    "the effects of both linear and nonlinear terms in the hydrodynamic fluctuations close to the convection threshold have been evaluated .",
    "this line of research turned out to be very important , mainly because it lead to the development of convection model equations for dealing with spatiotemporal - pattern formation above the threshold , as reviewed by cross and hohenberg  @xcite .    a second and independent line of research developed when investigators became interested in the nature of the fluctuations in nonequilibrium steady states far away from any hydrodynamic instability .",
    "the first important theoretical work along this line was done by kirkpatrick et al . , who calculated the correct expression for the structure factor of a fluid subjected to a stationary temperature gradient  @xcite .",
    "althought their result was originally obtained on the basis of the same mode coupling theory that in equilibrium leads to long - time tail contributions to the correlation functions for the transport coefficients , it turned out that the same result could also be obtained from the simpler scheme of landau s fluctuating hydrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "this line of research received an important momentum from the experimental side when the research group of sengers and coworkers verified from light - scattering experiments the main conclusion of the theoretical result , namely that the nonequilibrium contribution to the structure factor of a liquid is proportional to the square of the temperature gradient @xmath5 and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wave number @xmath0 of the fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "theory and experiments have subsequently been extended to also deal with nonequilibrium fluctuations in liquid mixtures and polymer solutions , as reviewed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a third line of independent research has focused on the real - space behavior of the nonequilibrium correlations resulting from the heat - diffusion equation  @xcite .",
    "a study of the correlations resulting from the heat - diffusion equation is equivalent to a study of the nonequilibrium correlations in a liquid in the direction co - incident with the temperature gradient .",
    "this line of research has shown how the nonequilibrium correlation function of the fluctuating variables encompasses the entire system not involving any intrinsic lenght scales .",
    "the real - space analysis has demonstrated the long - range nature of the nonequilibrium fluctuations in the direction of the temperature gradient , which has been further confirmed by numerical integration of the equations  @xcite , by computer simulations  @xcite and by a lattice - gas automaton approach  @xcite .",
    "it is our present goal to further extend the second aforementioned research so as to describe nonequilibrium fluctuations far away from any convective instability , nonequilibrium fluctuations close to the convective instability and nonequilibrium fluctuations produced by the heat - diffusion equation from one unified point of view . the original work of kirkpatrick et al .",
    "and of others  @xcite yielded an expression for the structure factor of a fluid in thermally nonequilibrium states without considering any gravity or boundary effects .",
    "segr at al .",
    "extended the theory to include gravity effects , first in a one - component liquid  @xcite and then in a liquid mixture  @xcite .",
    "they predicted that gravity will cause the singular @xmath1 dependence of the structure factor to saturate at small values of @xmath0 .",
    "this prediction was confirmed experimentally by vailati and giglio from light - scattering experiments at ultra - small scattering angles  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ortiz de zrate et al . evaluated the nonequilibrium structure factor including finite - size effects but neglecting gravity  @xcite .",
    "they concluded that deviations from the @xmath1 dependence due to finite - size effects will be just as important as deviations due to gravity .",
    "hence , for a quantitative interpretation of ultra - low - angle light scattering or shadowgraph experiments it is important to account for both gravity and finite - size effects .    in this paper we extend the previous work so as to include gravity and finite - size effects simultaneously . starting from the linearized fluctuating boussinesq equations",
    ", we shall derive a complete expression for the structure factor of the nonequilibrium fluid making no other approximations than the ones incorporated in the boussinesq equations .",
    "we shall then show that the resulting expression is capable of describing nonequilibrium fluctuations both far away and close to the convective instability .",
    "close to the convective instability we shall recover the linear swift - hohenberg correlation function as an approximation to our more complete result . from the study of the behavior of the nonequilibrium correlation function in real space , we shall recover with appropriate approximations , expressions and plots previously obtained by other investigators for the case of the heat - diffusion equation .",
    "thus it will be shown how these various conclusions can be reached from one single theoretical result .    attempts to arrive at a unified description of nonequilibrium fluctuations both far away and close to the convective instability has been made by kirkpatrick and cohen  @xcite and by schmitz and cohen  @xcite , but the consequences of their theoretical results for the interpretation of actual experiments are not clear . in contrast , we shall be able to make a connection with available experimental data for the thermal fluctuations near the convective rayleigh - bnard instability  @xcite .",
    "there has been an extensive debate whether fluctuating hydrodynamics can properly account for the thermal fluctuations close to the onset of convection  @xcite , but the most recent answer to this question appears to be positive  @xcite .",
    "the present paper will provide additional evidence for the validity of fluctuating hydrodynamics to describe nonequilibrium fluctuations close to the onset of the classical rayleigh - bnard instability in simple fluids .",
    "we shall proceed as follows .",
    "we start from the linear fluctuating boussinesq equations which will be written in a form most suitable for our analysis in section  [ sec:0 ] . in section  [ sec:1 ]",
    "we review the derivation of the well - known expression for the structure factor of a fluid subjected to a stationary temperature gradient without taking into account the presence of boundaries , but including the effects of gravity .",
    "the relationship of the resulting expression for the effect of gravity with that obtained previously by segr et al .",
    "@xcite will be elucidated . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we then consider the modifications to the nonequilibrium structure factor due to the finite height of the fluid layer . in section",
    "[ sec : ls ] we present a detailed analysis of how the combined effects of gravity and finite - size will appear in low - angle light scattering and in shadowgraph experiments .",
    "sections  [ sec:2 ] and  [ sec : ls ] contain the most important new features of the present work . in section  [ sec : ins ] we introduce an approximation valid close to the convective instability and show how one can recover the linear swift - hohenberg model for the fluctuations near the convective threshold . in section  [ sec : rs ]",
    "we discuss the spatial behavior of the nonequilibrium structure factor and we shall make contact with the results obtained by previous investigators for the long - range nature of the nonequilibrium fluctuations in the direction of the temperature gradient .",
    "our results are summarized in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we consider a fluid layer between two horizontal plates separated by a distance @xmath6 . the fluid layer is subjected to a temperature gradient in the vertical direction by maintaining the plates at two different temperatures .",
    "the size of the system in the two horizontal x- and y - directions is much larger than the size @xmath6 in the vertical z - direction .    to determine the structure factor of the fluid we consider small fluctuations around the conductive solution .",
    "these small fluctuations shall be described by the linearized boussinesq equations supplemented with random noise terms , as first considered by zaitsev and shliomis and by swift and hohenberg for studying the influence of thermal noise close to the convective instability  @xcite .",
    "use of the boussinesq approximation to the full hydrodynamics equations implies that we neglect the sound modes and consider only density fluctuations caused by temperature fluctuations .",
    "the temperature gradient is applied along the z - direction and is written in the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the average local value of the temperature @xmath9 and where @xmath10 .",
    "hence , @xmath11 is positive when the fluid layer is heated from above and negative when heated from below .",
    "the gravitational force @xmath12 is directed in the negative z - direction : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational acceleration constant . in this notation",
    ", the rayleigh number may be defined as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath17 the kinematic viscosity and @xmath18 the thermal diffusivity of the fluid .",
    "we shall evaluate the structure factor of the fluid maintained in a convection - free thermal nonequilibrium state , where the average value @xmath19 of the fluid velocity @xmath20 will be zero .",
    "such states correspond to both negative and positive values of the rayleigh number @xmath3 as long as @xmath3 is smaller than the critical value @xmath4 . for this purpose",
    "we write the linearized fluctuating boussinesq equations in the form  @xcite :    [ rb ] @xmath21 @xmath22    where @xmath23 represents the local fluctuating temperature and @xmath24 is the fluctuating z - component of the fluid velocity @xmath25 . to eliminate the stationary pressure gradient from the equations we find it convenient to consider eq .",
    "( [ rb:1 ] ) for @xmath26 , rather than an equation for the fluctuating fluid velocity @xmath20 itself  @xcite .",

    "we note that we are here considering only the effects of additive noise represented by @xmath27 and @xmath28 in eqs .",
    "( [ rb ] ) .",
    "multiplicative noise has been also considered in the literature  @xcite , but that subject lies outside the scope of the present paper . since @xmath36 and @xmath37 everywhere in the fluid layer , we note that the solution of the fluctuating boussinesq equations will be independent of the sign adopted for @xmath38 or @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the conditions for the validity of the boussinesq equations , also referred to as oberbeck - boussinesq equations , have been discussed extensively in the literature  @xcite . specifically , in deriving the boussinesq equations from the more general hydrodynamic equations , one neglects the temperature dependence of the various thermophysical properties , except for the density which is taken to vary linearly with temperature .",
    "deviations of this so - called boussinesq approximation do affect the characteristic nature of pattern formation upon the appearance of convection  @xcite .",
    "however , the intensity of the nonequilibrium fluctuations in convection - free states below the convective instability appears to be much less sensitive to deviations from the boussinesq approximation .",
    "segr et al .",
    "have analyzed and measured the temperature fluctuations in liquid toluene subjected to temperature gradients up to 220 k @xmath39  @xcite . at the higher value of the temperature gradient some of the thermophysical properties varied significantly over the height of the fluid layer",
    "nevertheless , the intensity of the observed nonequilibrium temperature fluctuations was equal to the intensity predicted when all thermophysical - property values are taken at their average value in the fluid layer .",
    "similar results were obtained by ahlers , measuring the critical rayleigh number for the onset of rayleigh - bnard convection and the heat transfer slightly above the threshold  @xcite .",
    "we note that in the derivation of the boussinesq equations it is also assumed that the adiabatic temperature gradient @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the isobaric specific heat capacity and @xmath42 the average temperature in the fluid layer , is small and can be neglected compared to the magnitude of the imposed temperature gradient . in practice , this is a very good approximation  @xcite .",

    "starting from the fluctuating boussinesq equations , we first derive an expression for the structure factor of a fluid subjected to a stationary temperature gradient in the presence of gravity but in the absence of any boundary conditions .",
    "althought the resulting expression for such a bulk structure factor will only be meaningful for negative rayleigh numbers , it will enable us to develop a procedure most suited for subsequent incorporation of boundary effects .    in the absence of any boundary conditions ,",
