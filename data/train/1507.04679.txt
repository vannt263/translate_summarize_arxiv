    "direct observation of shear - induced distortions in the glass is achieved using simultaneous oscillatory rheology and synchrotron x - ray scattering .",
    "the highly brilliant synchrotron x - ray beam is launched through the sheared layer of suspension from which it scatters  ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "the particle volume fraction of the suspension is @xmath2 , close to the colloidal glass transition ( see materials and methods ) .",
    "we apply oscillatory shear at fixed frequency and increasing amplitude ; this probes the glass with an increasing oscillatory shear field from the linear elastic to the nonlinear flow regime and allows measurement of the storage and loss moduli , @xmath3 and @xmath4 simultaneously with the measured structure factor .",
    "the angle average of the structure factor , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , reveals the typical short - range order of a dense glass .",
    "when we resolve this structure factor in the diffraction plane , we reveal a characteristic shear - induced distortion of the nearest - neighbor structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c : the twofold ( p - wave ) symmetry indicates the affine distortion of nearest neighbor configurations under the applied shear deformation .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d : particles tend to accumulate and crowd in the compression sectors of the shear plane , and dilate in the extension sectors . because of strong excluded - volume repulsion , particle accumulation and loss do not balance , leading to a net depletion of particles from the cage , and a resulting loss of connectivity of the glass structure . in an elastic material , the particle displacement field is affine , i.e. homogeneous across the material .",
    "the affine distortion of nearest neighbor cages induces force - dipoles , directed along the velocity direction , with an associated elastic field that has exactly the twofold symmetry ( p - wave symmetry , @xmath5 ) as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ( see supporting information ) .",
    "hence , the two - fold symmetry is consistent with the elastic response of the glass to the applied shear .",
    "( -190,0)(a )   ( -165,70)(b ) ( -165,0)(c )   ( -110,0)(d )    this two - fold symmetry vanishes at larger strain : at strain amplitudes of around 10@xmath1 , the structure factor becomes isotropic ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) , indicating loss of affine distortions . to quantify these affine distortions , we use angular correlations that pick out the characteristic symmetry of the structure factor while averaging over fluctuations , as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "these angular correlations hence characterize the degree of elastic response to the imposed shear deformation .",
    "we can now follow the evolution of the structural symmetry as a function of the applied strain . to do so ,",
    "we define a structural order parameter from the peak value of the correlation function , which is 1 for ideal twofold symmetry , and 0 for complete symmetry loss , and illustrate its evolution in fig .",
    "this order parameter drops sharply to zero at @xmath6 , indicating the abrupt loss of affine distortions , and the sudden transition to an isotropic liquid - like state .",
    "this is demonstrated most clearly in the inset , where we show the full evolution of the angular correlation function along the vertical axis : red and blue color at small strain ( top ) indicate the twofold symmetry associated with affine distortions , while green color at larger strain ( bottom ) indicates the isotropic state .",
    "the symmetry vanishes abruptly at @xmath7 , indicating a sharp loss of orientational order and thus melting in the orientational degrees of freedom . at the same time , the mean value of @xmath8 does not change , indicating robust translational degrees of freedom .",
    "this sharp symmetry change is observed in all other measures of the angle - dependent structure factor such as its peak height and width .",
    "it reminds of first - order equilibrium transitions , but in the case here is induced by the applied strain .",
    "the observed sharpness is in agreement with a well - known theorem  @xcite that transitions between a ( liquid ) state with isotropic symmetry ( continuous symmetry group ) and a ( solid ) state with broken - symmetry ( e.g. the discrete point - group symmetry of a lattice ) can not occur continuously , and have to be first - order in nature . we hence conclude that at @xmath6 , the glass exhibits a sharp symmetry change in its microscopic degrees of freedom , induced by the applied oscillatory shear .",
    "this transition results from the increasing distortion of the glass structure associated with the increasing applied strain amplitude .",
    "we measure the corresponding non - affine component directly from the difference of nearest - neighbour peak positions in the flow and vorticity direction . in the shear - neutral diffraction plane ,",
    "affine shear displacements vanish , and any observed distortion must be due to non - affine components .",
    "the emerging non - affine distortion , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , indeed confirms the mechanism proposed in fig .",
    "[ fig1]d : with increasing strain amplitude , the nearest - neighbor peak moves to larger @xmath9 in the flow direction , and to smaller @xmath9 in the perpendicular direction . because of the reciprocal relationship between wave vector @xmath9 and lengths in real space , this reflects a real - space contraction along the flow direction , and dilation perpendicular to it , as demonstrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig2]d . from the difference of orthogonal distances , @xmath10",
    ", we determine that the relative non - affine distortion is @xmath11 , while the affine strain is @xmath12 , in good agreement with the value estimated from the correlation function in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy vanishes abruptly at @xmath13 , again signaling the transition into the liquid - like state : the material can no longer sustain the anisotropic structure , and changes spontaneously into an isotropic fluid - like state .",
    "this is likewise reflected in the peak width , whose weak anisotropy vanishes at the transition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]c .",
    "further signature of the transition is obtained in the fluctuations of the scattered intensity .",
    "we immediately see that at @xmath7 , the amplitude of fluctuations increases abruptly as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( blue ) . to further investigate the nature of fluctuations ,",
    "we distinguish correlated and uncorrelated fluctuations using the kurtosis @xmath14 : a kurtosis value of 3 indicates a gaussian distribution and thus uncorrelated fluctuations , while a kurtosis value smaller than 3 indicates correlated fluctuations .",
    "we compute @xmath14 for each strain from the intensity distribution along the first diffraction ring ( see materials and methods ) and show its evolution in fig .",
    "concomitantly with the increase in amplitude , the nature of fluctuations changes : a sharp rise of @xmath14 to a value of @xmath15 indicates a sudden transition from correlated to uncorrelated gaussian fluctuations .",
    "such gaussian fluctuations are indeed indicative of diffusive particle transport in liquids , giving yet another evidence of the melting of the glass in the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "together , the disappearance of anisotropy , the increase of fluctuation amplitude , and the transition to gaussian distributions conclusively demonstrate the sudden melting , i.e. sharp transition from a solid to a liquid - like state of the amorphous material under the applied shear .",
    "( right axis , green curve ) as a function of the increasing strain amplitude . at @xmath16 , fluctuations increase sharply , and the kurtosis jumps to its gaussian value 3 ( red dotted line ) indicating liquid - like response .",
    "the small peak of @xmath14 at strains below @xmath16 is attributed to combined emergence of anisotropy in peak position and peak width as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , c. fluctuations are averaged over one oscillation period ( see supporting information ) .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    to relate this transition to the macroscopic mechanical properties of the glass , we use the stress response recorded simultaneously to determine the mechanical moduli .",
    "in linear response , the rheology is characterized by the storage and loss moduli , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , determined from the in and out - of - phase harmonic stress response .",
    "we show these moduli as a function of strain together with the structure factor in fig .",
    "they exhibit the well - known strain dependence of soft glassy materials : the dominance of @xmath17 over @xmath18 at small strain indicates the predominant elastic response of the material , and their decrease and intersection at higher strain indicate the loss of elasticity and flow of the glass .",
    "the intersection of @xmath19 and @xmath18 has been associated with the transition from a solid to a liquid state of the material  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this intersection coincides precisely with the sharp structural transition , allowing us to identify it with the rheological solid - to - liquid transition of the material  @xcite . we show in the supporting information that the macroscopic criterion @xmath20 is in fact equivalent to the equality of the two central microscopic contributions : affine and non - affine  @xcite .",
    "we hence find experimentally that the rheological yielding of the material occurs precisely when the affine and non - affine manifestations of the shear modulus become equal .",
    "these results indicate that the affine to non - affine transition is _ the _ central microscopic mechanism that controls the solid - liquid transition of the amorphous material .",
    "we note that the moduli @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent only the first harmonic response ; higher harmonics are not taken into account , although they can be quite significant  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these higher harmonics might evidence a sharper transition also in the mechanical response .",
    "indeed , recent theoretical work in systems with excluded - volume interactions  @xcite indicates that the shear modulus exhibits a sharp transition ( as also suggested by mode - coupling theory  @xcite ) , but the jump is very small and may not be easily resolved in experiments , thus leaving the overall impression of a continuous transition .",
    "such continuous transition is recently also observed in slow , continuous shear  @xcite .",
    "our result of a sharp transition in oscillatory experiments that rather probe the stress stability limit of the material  @xcite is particularly interesting for a full universal understanding of the mechanical behavior of glasses .    in conclusion ,",
    "the abrupt change of structural symmetry and nature of fluctuations consistently demonstrate a sharp transition in the microscopic degrees of freedom of a glass upon mechanical failure .",
    "the shear - induced , discrete symmetry characteristic of elastic solids vanishes abruptly , and isotropic gaussian fluctuations characteristic of liquids appear , indicating a surprisingly sharp , dynamically - induced transition ( symmetry - breaking ) from a solid to a liquid - like state .",
    "this sharp transition and symmetry - breaking are all hallmarks of first - order equilibrium transitions .",
    "furthermore , the symmetry breaking is an essential ingredient in the context of generalized rigidity and goldstone s theorem  @xcite , to explain the emergence of stiffness from the breaking of the isotropic symmetry of the liquid .",
    "this symmetry change has not been detected before which made it impossible , so far , to explain why glasses are , at all , rigid .",
    "we reveal this symmetry - breaking here as dynamically induced ( as opposed to spontaneous ) , induced by the applied oscillatory shear field .",
    "while this point requires further theoretical investigation , we identify this transition as fundamental affine to non - affine transition in the microscopic degrees of freedom : the increasing shear amplitude causes increasing distortion of the nearest - neighbor structure , leading to loss of connectivity and proliferating nonaffine displacements , until at crossover to flow , the response becomes completely dominated by non - affine displacements .",
    "we suggest that , in analogy to first - order equilibrium transitions , this sharp transition can result from two underlying free energy curves due to the two competing modes of displacements - affine and non - affine .",
    "the material then exhibits a sharp jump in the contributions of the two respective modes of displacement , consistent with the order parameter jump from initially @xmath21 , suggesting the presence of both contributions .",
    "while our combined x - ray scattering and rheology measurement allows us to clearly observe this transition in a colloidal glass , we expect it to be a ubiquitous feature of the mechanical failure of amorphous solids , and to occur in a wide range of technologically important materials from soft colloidal and polymer to hard molecular glasses , where the hard - core repulsion is replaced by the quantum mechanical short - range repulsion due to pauli s principle .",
    "our results hence suggest a new unified framework of the mechanical stability and failure of amorphous materials crucial to their application as engineering materials , and offers new perspectives on the glass transition .",
    "the experiments were carried out at the beamline p10 of the synchrotron petra iii at desy . to measure the rheology and structure factor",
    "simultaneously , we placed an adapted commercial rheometer ( mars ii , thermo fisher ) into the x - ray beam path of the synchrotron .",
    "the well - collimated x - ray beam ( wavelength @xmath22 nm ) is deflected vertically to pass the layer of suspension in the shear - gradient direction , see fig .",
    "the suspension consists of silica particles in saline water ( 1 mm nacl to screen the particle charges ) , with a diameter of @xmath23 nm and a polydispersity of @xmath24 preventing crystallization .",
    "dense samples with effective volume fraction @xmath2 at the colloidal glass transition were prepared by diluting centrifuged samples .",
    "measurements of the relaxation time yielded @xmath25  @xcite , with @xmath26 the relaxation time at infinite dilution , consistent with @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "after loading , the samples are sealed with low - viscosity oil to prevent evaporation and guarantee sample stability over more than 4 hours , allowing us to measure samples repeatedly and reproducibly .",
    "samples were initialized by a fixed protocol ( preshear at @xmath27 s@xmath28 for 120 seconds , followed by 600 seconds rest ) .",
    "we apply oscillatory strain with frequency @xmath29 hz and amplitude @xmath30 increasing from @xmath31 to @xmath32 ( 100 points on a logarithmic scale , three oscillations averaged per cycle , leading to total duration of the experiment of around 5 minutes ) .",
    "we use a pilatus detector at a distance of @xmath33 cm and a frame rate of 10 hz to measure the scattered intensity in the velocity - vorticity plane .",
    "the detector ( pixel size @xmath34 @xmath35m@xmath36 ) covers scattering angles @xmath37 between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , allowing access to wave vectors @xmath40 in the range @xmath41 to @xmath42 . from the recorded intensity",
    ", we determine the structure factor @xmath43 by subtracting the solvent background and dividing by the particle form factor determined from dilute suspensions .",
    "we focus on the first peak of the structure factor to investigate the nearest - neighbor structure .",
    "we use angular correlation functions to investigate the symmetry change of the structure factor .",
    "angular correlations are computed on the first diffraction ring @xmath44 according to @xmath45 here , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are polar angles in the diffraction plane , and we integrate over the angle @xmath46 as a function of the correlation angle @xmath47 .",
    "possible effects of elliptical distortion of the first ring are reduced by averaging radially over a range of wave vectors ( @xmath48 ) around @xmath49 .",
    "we define the peak value @xmath50 as structural order parameter ; this allows us to measure the symmetry change as a function of applied strain .",
    "to analyze the fluctuations of the order parameter and structure factor , we first check whether there is a characteristic time scale of fluctuations",
    ". such time scale can for example be the underlying oscillation period , during which the glass may yield and reform  @xcite . to check for such time scale , we compute time correlations according to @xmath51 where @xmath52 and we correlate order parameter values @xmath53 as a function of delay time @xmath54 . for sufficiently large averaging time interval , @xmath55 , the time correlation should pick out the typical fluctuation time scales if present",
    ". however , our data gives no evidence of a characteristic time scale ( see supporting information ) , as we have independently verified by fourier analysis .",
    "we thus interpret the fluctuations as noise . to obtain the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( blue ) , we average over all ten points within the oscillation cycle , i.e. we choose @xmath55 to be the oscillation period .",
