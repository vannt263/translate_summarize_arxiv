    "we find 12 objects , i.e. , 60% of the expectation .",
    "this is consistent with the completeness at this flux level in @xcite .",
    "dust luminosities ( @xmath52}$ ] ) and other parameters are estimated using cigale ( @xcite ) .",

    "the parameters of the dust attenuation law can be modified and cigale allows for two separate stellar populations with a multiphase dust treatment .",
    "we use the vla 1.4ghz radio data from @xcite which provides data down to a rms noise of 3.9 @xmath54jy per beam .",
    "the stellar emission is based on @xcite , while the dust emission is based on @xcite templates .",
    "cigale provides dust luminosities @xmath53 , while fuv luminosities @xmath55 are derived at @xmath56 nm and are defined through the quantity @xmath57 .",
    "an energy budget is performed during the fit , and the maximum value allowed for @xmath53 has to be consistent with the energy moved by dust grains from the uv - optical range to the fir range .",

    "their average dust luminosity is @xmath60 and their stellar average mass is @xmath61 . a comparison with @xcite shows that the average stellar mass is similar to the average stellar mass ( @xmath62 ) of @xmath63 lbgs detected at @xmath64 m . the dust temperatures @xmath65 are estimated for a few objects by fitting modified black bodies with an emissivity index of 1.5 .",
    "we find that two of the low-@xmath23 lbgs have @xmath65 @xmath66k , while the high-@xmath23 ulirg has @xmath67k ( see table  [ table ] ) .",
    "the two low-@xmath23 lbgs have quite low temperatures compared with ulirgs / smgs , but may be typical of star - forming galaxies in general , while the high-@xmath23 one is similar to e.g. arp220 .",
    "our lbg seds in the rest - frame uv are in very good agreement with the rest - frame uv spectra of the @xcite s composite spectrum at @xmath68 .",
    "whatever the redshift range , lbgs seem to present the same starburst characteristics in the rest - frame uv , which is expected , given that similar rest - frame color selection criteria are used",
    ". however , the colors become redder when the objects are detected at 24@xmath40 m by _ spitzer _ and even redder when they are detected at 250@xmath40 m by _ herschel _ spire .",
    "this can be interpreted as being due to higher dust attenuations ( see fig .",
    "[ color ] ) , and is consistent with @xcite , who found that both_spitzer_-detected and undetected lbgs have about the same stellar population ages , but the latter are more extinguished .",
    "the agn fraction determined by cigale is always consistent with zero , except for the galaxy j123633.2@xmath69620834.3 , for which a 20% agn contribution to the fir dust luminosity is suggested .",
    "most of the ir excess due to a potential agn should be in the mir , while the spire flux is expected to be dominated by the starburst component @xcite ; cigale accounts for both .",
    "the vast majority of the dropout galaxies are not detected by spire with the present detection limits .",
    "if lbgs were to follow @xcite relation ( relating uv - attenuation to dust emission ) , what fraction of them would be detectable ?",
    "we can use the @xmath70 color as a proxy for the rest - frame @xmath14 - m[{\\rm nuv}]$ ] .",
    "simulations suggest that this color provides @xmath71 with an accuracy better than 0.01 for power - laws @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and 0 . in detail",

    "these values of @xmath53 can be transformed into @xmath78 and @xmath79 using the following calibrations computed from the @xcite models with @xmath80 , i.e. , star - forming galaxies with similar properties to lbgs .",
    "we have also checked that @xcite models are consistent with our calibration . by fitting polynomials as a function of redshift we find :    @xmath81    with @xmath82 ( 1.168 , @xmath831.166 , 0.565 , @xmath830.091 ) for @xmath84 m , ( 1.689 , @xmath831.426 , 0.582 , @xmath830.089 ) for @xmath85 m , and ( 2.336 , @xmath831.605 , 0.556 , @xmath830.078 ) for @xmath86 m .    assuming the @xcite relation allows to estimate rough order of magnitude @xmath87 for our lbgs @xcite . at @xmath88",

    "[ afuvlfuv ] suggests that the _ maximum _ level of attenuation depends on @xmath55 ",
    "the most uv - luminous lbgs yield a lower maximum @xmath3 than less uv - luminous ones .",
    "this is true for upper limits as well as for detections .",
    "the two higher redshift lensed lbgs detected in fir or in sub - mm ( the `` cosmic eye '' , @xcite and cb58 , @xcite ) also comply with this upper boundary , if we correct for the amplification . as do the two unlensed lbgs mm8 @xcite and mmd11 @xcite .",
    "we stress that most of the upper limits should populate the area below the observational limits but none would prevent us from detecting lbgs that would have larger fuv dust attenuations than the one suggested by the present data for a given @xmath55 .",
    "@xcite suggest that objects with a lower uv luminosity at @xmath90 have lower bolometric luminosities than uv - bright galaxies which , in turn , may suggest lower dust attenuations if we account for the relation between bolometric luminosities and dust attenuations .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite at much higher redshifts .",
    "but , when computing a@xmath91 from the stacked points of @xcite , we find a trend similar to ours for most of the points . @xcite and @xcite estimate the uv dust attenuation by comparing radio - based star formation rates to uv - based ones using a stacking analysis .",
    "we show fig .",
    "[ afuvlfuv ] , the two points corresponding to different @xmath92 and they agree with the above trend .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion using _ spitzer _ @xmath8 m observations of a sample of lbg at @xmath93 .",
    "finally , we have divided our @xmath94 sample in two sub - samples as a function of l@xmath91 and stacked them in the 250@xmath95 image ( fig .",
    "[ afuvlfuv ] ) .",
    "we find the same trend , again .",
    "note , however , that accounting for the error bars , our stacking and @xcite , s are both consistent with a constant @xmath3 .",
    "also , whenever the selection is not fully complete , one may miss objects in the regions where the brightest sources ( uv and ir ) lie .",
    "this effect due to the inhomogeneous background produces holes in the stacking ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for this very reason , the z @xmath96 1 stacked points are only considered as lower limits and we were not able to stack z @xmath96 2 lbgs .",
    "to understand the origin of this effect , we build a simple closed box model ( see @xcite ) , assuming several exponentially decreasing star formation histories @xmath97 , with @xmath98 = 0.1 , 1 and 10gyr .",
    "we assume a mass of cold gas @xmath99 that forms stars following a salpeter initial mass function , and thus produce heavy elements .",
    "@xmath99 evolves as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the mass ejected by stars at the end of their lifetime .",
    "the oxygen abundance @xmath102 can be estimated as @xmath103,\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the oxygen yield and @xmath105 is the fraction of mass kept in stellar remnants .",
    "we estimate an empirical relation from @xcite that links @xmath106 to @xmath53 : @xmath107 @xcite s objects are in the redshift range @xmath90 , so very close to ours and with metallicities in the range 8.2 @xmath108 12/log(o / h ) @xmath108 8.8 which corresponds to ages in the range of a few 100 myrs to 5 gyrs .",
    "so , strictly speaking , our models are extrapolations for low @xmath98 s but are in the good range for @xmath98 = 10 gyrs .",
    "finally , from @xmath53 we compute @xmath3 using the relationship from @xcite .",
    "[ afuvlfuv ] shows that this simple closed box model follows the same trend as our lbgs in the diagram .",
    "the initial mass of gas is set to @xmath109 to explain the low redshift lbgs and @xmath110 ( not plotted ) for the high redshift lbgs .",
    "this is in agreement with the mass of cold gas predicted by models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we find that star - formation timescales of @xmath111 gyr seem to be ruled out by this model .",
    "we have selected two samples of lbgs at @xmath93 and @xmath112 . for the first time , we can put constraints on the dust emission and therefore the dust attenuation of lbgs directly from rest - frame fir measurements of individual lbgs observed with _",
    "two main conclusions can be drawn from this analysis .",
    "we detected 12/260 @xmath96 4.6% and 1/1558 @xmath96 0.06% of the lbgs at @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "all the other lbgs are undetected by spire , and their dust attenuation is lower than the detected lbgs .. however , we have to account for the fact that the limits depend on @xmath55 .",
