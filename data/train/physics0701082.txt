    "cooperation plays an important role in real world , ranging from biological systems to economic and social systems @xcite .",
    "scientists from many different fields of natural and social sciences often resort to evolutionary game theory @xcite as a common mathematical framework and the prisoner s dilemma game ( pdg ) as a metaphor for studying cooperation between unrelated individuals @xcite .",
    "the original pdg describes the pairwise interactions of individuals with two behavioral options : the two players must simultaneously decide whether to cooperate or to defect . for mutual cooperation",
    "both players receive the rewards @xmath9 , but only the punishment @xmath10 for mutual defection . a defector exploiting a cooperator",
    "gets an amount @xmath11 ( temptation to defect ) and the exploited cooperator receives @xmath12 ( sucker s payoff ) .",
    "these elements satisfy the following two conditions : @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "it is easy to see that defection is the better choice irrespective of the opponent s decision .",
    "thus , the undesired outcome of mutual defection emerges in well - mixed populations @xcite , which has inspired numerous investigations of suitable extensions that enable cooperative behavior to emerge and persist .",
    "some previous works have suggested several mechanisms ( e.g. , kin selection @xcite , the introduction of tit - for - tat@xcite strategy , and voluntary participation @xcite ) to facilitate the emergence and persistence of cooperation in the populations .",
    "the spatial versions @xcite of the evolutionary pdgs can explain the maintenance of cooperation for the iterated games with a limited range of interaction if the players follow one of the two simplest strategies ( defection ( @xmath15 ) and cooperation ( @xmath16 ) ) . recently , the effect of heterogeneous influence of different individuals on the maintenance of cooperative behavior has been studied on regular small - world networks @xcite .",
    "et al . _ have studied the evolutionary pdg and the snowdrift game with preferential learning mechanism on the barabsi - albert networks @xcite . in the evolutionary games the players wish to maximize their total payoffs , coming from pdgs with the neighbors , by",
    "adopting either the deterministic rule introduced by nowak and may @xcite or the stochastic evolutionary rule by szab and tke @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we make further studies of the evolutionary pdg on square lattice mainly according to the stochastic update rule .",
    "it is natural to consider that different individuals may have different attractiveness in social systems , so when updating their strategies , the individuals may not completely randomly choose a neighbor to refer to .",
    "here , we introduce the nonlinear attractive effect into the game ( see the model below ) .",

    "each player interacts only with its four nearest neighbors ( self - interaction is excluded ) @xcite , and collects payoffs dependent on the payoff - matrix parameters .",
    "the total payoff of a certain player is the sum over all its interactions .",
    "we have inspected that if every player interacts with its first and second nearest neighbors or the self - interactions are included , the qualitative results are unchanged . following common practices @xcite , we start by rescaling the game to make @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where @xmath17 represents the advantage of defectors over cooperators @xcite , being typically constrained to the interval @xmath39 , such that it depends on a single parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we have checked that the qualitative results do not change if we make @xmath40 in order to strictly enforce a pd setting .    during the evolutionary process",
    ", each player is allowed to select one of its neighbors as a reference with a probability proportional to the neighbors attractiveness , and then decides whether to change its strategy or not dependent on their payoff difference .",
    "we define the selection probability @xmath41 of @xmath42 selecting a neighbor @xmath43 as @xmath44 where the numerator denotes the attractiveness of the neighbor @xmath43 , and @xmath2 is a tunable parameter describing the extent of the nonlinear effect , and @xmath45 is the total payoff of that neighbor .",
    "the denominator is the sum of attractiveness that runs over all neighbors of @xmath42 .",
    "the basic ingredient which determines the choice of one neighbor is the _ selection kernel _ @xmath0 . on general grounds ,",
    "this _ selection kernel _ should be a nondecreasing function of @xmath1 , namely individuals with better performance may have much stronger attractiveness than the average individual .",
    "we note that the selection probability depends only on the extent of a nonlinear effect @xmath2 since the total payoff collected by any player satisfies @xmath46 in the present model .",
    "thus we will consider the model with @xmath47 .",
    "for @xmath20 , the neighbor is randomly selected so that the game is reduced to the original one in refs .",

    "the attractiveness of the neighbors is a nonlinear function of their total payoffs . in this way",
    ", we consider the general situations of the nonlinear attractive effect on the dynamical behavior of the game .",

    "qualitatively , the results remain unaffected when changing the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "simulations were carried out for a population of @xmath53 individuals .",
    "we study the key quantity of cooperator density @xmath4 in the steady state .",
    "initially , the two strategies of @xmath16 and @xmath15 are randomly distributed among the individuals with equal probability @xmath54 .",
    "the above model was simulated with synchronous updating @xcite .",
    "no qualitative changes occur if we adopt an asynchronous updating @xcite . eventually , the system reaches a dynamic equilibrium state .",
    "the simulation results were obtained by averaging over the last @xmath55 monte carlo time steps of the total @xmath56 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the results of both simulations and theoretical analysis of @xmath4 when increasing @xmath17 for several different values of @xmath2 ( see the plot ) .",
    "we can find that , compared with the well - mixed situation , if @xmath17 is sufficiently small , cooperators can persist in spatial settings in the case of @xmath20 , which indicates that spatial structure can promote cooperation @xcite .",
    "for @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , where @xmath59 is the extinction threshold of cooperators when @xmath20 , the benefits of spatial clustering are no longer sufficient to offset the losses along the boundary , hence the cooperators vanish @xcite . for each positive value of @xmath2",
    ", the system evolves to the absorbing state of all defectors at certain values of @xmath17 .",
    "the extinction threshold of cooperators @xmath34 clearly increases with @xmath2 , which indicates that the emergence of cooperation is enhanced .",
    "we know that cooperators survive by forming compact clusters and thus cooperators along the boundary can outweigh their losses against defectors by gains from interactions within the cluster @xcite .",
    "the payoffs collected by the inner cooperators are , in most cases , larger than the boundary defectors .",
    "when considering the attractiveness of the individuals , near the extinction threshold , for cooperator - clusters which are surrounded by defectors , the cooperators along the boundary can keep their cooperative states more easily under stronger preferential selection effect according to the dynamic updating eq .",
    "( [ rule1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ rule2 ] ) .",
    "thus the strong attractiveness of individuals can favor the spreading of cooperators , hence promote the persistence of cooperation .",
    "we can also see that , for very large @xmath2 , the homogeneous cooperation state ( @xmath60 ) emerges when @xmath17 is very small . since both the small temptation to defect and the strong nonlinear attractive effect are advantageous to the persistence of cooperation , it is not surprising that @xmath4 approaches the maximal fraction @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , for the same value of @xmath17 , @xmath4 obviously increases with @xmath2 . the existence of strong nonlinear effect can facilitate the formation of cooperator clusters , hence enhance the persistence of cooperators ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in addition , the cooperator density @xmath4 and the extinction thresholds @xmath34 change more slowly with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we will consider this point in the following .",
    "the pair approximation method , which models the frequency of strategy pairs rather than that of strategies , is usually regarded as an analytical approximation of the spatial dynamics @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the results obtained by pair approximation are directly associated with the local topological structure of the players and the strategy updating dynamics .",
    "whether the strategy updating is implemented synchronously or asynchronously is inessential @xcite .",
    "therefore we can apply the pair approximation method to predict qualitatively the evolving behavior of @xmath4 . here",
    "we modify the original method by introducing the turnable parameter @xmath2 , i.e. , we substitute the new transition probability @xmath62 for the original transition probability @xmath63 in eq .",
    "( a1 ) in ref.[18 ] , where @xmath64 and the denominator of the fraction denotes the sum of all possible values of @xmath65 when @xmath2 is certain .",
    "then we adjust the eq .",
    "( a2a ) and eq .",
    "( a2b ) in ref.@xcite by substituting @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "the equilibrium values are obtained by numerical integration .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the pair approximation correctly predicts the trends , that is , the changes of cooperation for @xmath17 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , it is unable to estimate exactly the extinction thresholds of cooperator density , namely , it overestimates the extinction thresholds ( see the plot ) .",
    "a series of snapshots for several different values of @xmath2 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for the same value of @xmath17.these snapshots are a @xmath68 portion of the full @xmath69 lattice .",
    "we can find that , for random selection case @xmath20 , cooperators are doomed and defectors reign because the value @xmath70 is larger than @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "but for @xmath19 , when @xmath17 is just below @xmath72 , the cooperators can survive by forming compact clusters which minimize the exploitation by defectors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ) . for larger @xmath2 ,",
    "i.e. , stronger nonlinear attractive effect , more cooperator clusters emerge , which illustrates that cooperators can survive against the invading of defectors more easily . on the contrary ,",
    "the defector clusters decrease with the value of @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , the spatial patterns adopted by defectors are completely different from that of cooperators when they are the minority in the populations . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( f ) , defectors exist in the fashion of zigzag pattern ( or step - like ) . because if defector clusters are surrounded by cooperators , in the subsequent generations , the defectors along the boundary would transform probably to cooperators according to the selection rule with nonlinear attractive effects eq .",
    "( [ rule1 ] ) and updating rule eq .",
    "( [ rule2 ] ) . eventually , defectors exist in zigzag pattern from which they can benefit maximumly when interacting with their cooperator neighbors ( even can do better than a cooperator surrounded by four cooperators , so that when updating , they alwaysask their defector neighbors for strategy transformation ) , which in return makes the zigzag pattern stably in the evolution of the game .",
    "we also investigate the divergence behaviors of cooperators near the extinction thresholds @xmath34 for several values of @xmath2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "we constrained the system size as @xmath73 individuals and the results were obtained by averaging over the last @xmath74 time steps of the total @xmath75 . according to our simulations , near @xmath34",
    "the average fraction of cooperators vanishes as power - law like behavior @xmath76 , where @xmath33 are a set of exponents corresponding with the value of @xmath2 ( see the plots for detailed values ) . in physics , such thresholds",
    "are usually associated with phase transitions , and indeed , the transitions from persistent levels of cooperation ( @xmath77 ) to absorbing states of defection ( @xmath78 ) bear the hallmarks of critical phase transitions .",
    "these values of @xmath33 are nearly consistent with the critical exponent ( @xmath8 ) of the two - dimensional directed percolation @xcite and depend weakly on @xmath2",
    ". the estimated errors of @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 are @xmath85 respectively .",
    "we consider that the large errors are due to the limits of computational conditions .",
    "the variation of extinction threshold @xmath34 with the value of @xmath2 ( from zero to ten ) is shown in fig .",
    "we can see that the extinction threshold clearly increases with the value of @xmath2 .",
    "now we define a quantity characterizing the increment of the extinction threshold as @xmath86 .",
    "we note that this quantity decreases with the value of @xmath2 ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that , as @xmath48 , the increment @xmath35 will approach to the minimal value @xmath87 . in other words , the extinction threshold @xmath34 will tend towards the maximal value @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the extinction threshold when @xmath48 , i.e. , when the neighbor whose payoff is the highest of the neighboring is selected to refer to .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the promotion of cooperation in the context of evolutionary pdg resulting from the nonlinear attractive effect of the neighbors on square lattice . a nonlinear function @xmath90 , in terms of the performance of the players , is used as an estimator of their attractiveness .",
    "we have considered the general situations and shown that , compared with the random selection case , the introduction of the nonlinear attractive effect can remarkably promote the cooperative behavior over a wide range of @xmath17 .",
    "particularly , the stronger the extent of the nonlinear effect is , the more prominent the cooperative behavior will be , and for some large @xmath2 values , a homogeneous state of all cooperators can emerge .",
