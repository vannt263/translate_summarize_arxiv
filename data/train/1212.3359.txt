    "we consider the problem of designing sensing schemes to optimize the worst - case estimation performance when only a subset of sensors are operational in sensor networks .",
    "consider a set of @xmath2 sensors which are used to estimate an @xmath5-dimensional signal , where @xmath6 . in our problem , only @xmath7 out of these @xmath2 sensors operate at any instant of time .",
    "for example , to maximize the lifetime of a sensor network @xcite , at any single time instant , only @xmath7 sensors are turned on to monitor the @xmath5-dimensional signal .",
    "if we assume that each time these @xmath7 sensors are uniformly selected from the @xmath8 possible subsets , on average the lifetime of the sensor network is extended by a factor of @xmath9 . as another example , in hostile environments such as battlefields , it is very common that only a limited number of sensors , say @xmath7 out of @xmath2 , are able to survive and operate as designed . in these scenarios , while we only have a limited sensing resources at a single time instant , we wish to achieve the best estimation from limited observations .",
    "it is thus useful to maximize the worst - case performance of the sensing system , no matter what set of sensors are used or survive .",
    "we thus study the design of sensing schemes that optimize worst - case performance . before a formal mathematical formulation , we review two sensor network applications which relate singular values of certain matrices to estimation performance .      with @xmath10 representing the signal , consider a sensing matrix @xmath11 .",
    "each of the @xmath2 sensors generates a real observation represented by an inner product between @xmath12 and a column of @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 , with cardinality @xmath15 , be the subset of sensors that are active at a given time .",
    "the measurement matrix of the active sensors is then @xmath16 consisting of the @xmath7 columns of @xmath13 indexed by @xmath17 . with noise @xmath18 ,",
    "the measurement @xmath19 is @xmath20    suppose the singular values of @xmath21 are @xmath22 .",
    "then as long as @xmath21 has full row rank , the estimation error satisfies @xmath23 to optimize the worst - case performance , we must design @xmath13 to maximize the smallest singular value among all the @xmath8 possible submatrices @xmath21 . to make the problem meaningful , we assume that each column of @xmath13 has unit @xmath24 norm . when @xmath25 , this is equivalent to minimizing the maximum condition number among all @xmath8 submatrices @xmath21 .",
    "a second motivating application for this paper is optimum sensor placement for source monitoring in @xmath26 , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "monitoring is related to the notion of localization , where several sensors collaborate to locate a source , using some relative position information .",
    "the latter could be distance , bearing , time of arrival , time difference of arrival or received signal strength ( rss ) .",
    "monitoring assumes that a hazardous source has already been located at some @xmath27 , and a group of sensors at @xmath28 monitor it by continuously estimating its position from a safe distance",
    ". thus @xcite-@xcite place sensors , i.e. choose @xmath29 , so that the minimum eigenvalue of the fisher information matrix ( fim ) underlying the estimation problem is maximized .",
    "this ensures that under continuous monitoring and maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation , asymptotically , the mean - square error in estimating @xmath30 , is minimized , @xcite .",
    "as @xmath30 is at least roughly known , so also is the fim .",
    "consider @xcite , where no sensor can be closer than @xmath31 from the source .",
    "each measures the rss of the signal emanating from the source under log - normal shadowing , i.e. with known positive real scalars @xmath13 and @xmath32 , the rss @xmath33 at the @xmath34-th sensor obeys , for mutually independent @xmath35 : @xmath36 the underlying fim with @xmath2-sensors is , @xcite @xmath37 the optimal sensor placement problem then becomes : given , @xmath27 , and @xmath38 , find @xmath28 , @xmath39 so that the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath40 is maximized , subject to : @xmath41 because of the denominator in ( [ fim1 ] ) , the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath40 is maximized only if for all @xmath39 , @xmath42 . without loss of generality",
    "one can assume @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "thus effectively one must maximize the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath45 subject to @xmath46 .",
    "this is tantamount to minimizing the condition number of @xmath47 as its trace is constrained to be @xmath2 .",
    "now suppose to prolong battery life , only a subset of sensors is activated at a given time , @xcite .",
    "the logical problem to consider is then for some @xmath7 , @xmath17 as defined above , and @xmath48 to minimize the largest condition number of @xmath49 , among all @xmath50 . with @xmath21 having columns @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath51 , we have @xmath52 , and a similar setting of section [ ssens ] .",
    "we observe , that the _ minimum @xmath7 needed for source monitoring is three , motivating the rest of this paper where @xmath53 is considered . _",
    "in particular rss provides a distance estimate .",
    "distances from three non - collinear sources are necessary to localize , @xcite .",
    "this scenario also applies to the case where only three sensors survive hostilities .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : formulation ] gives a precise mathematical formulation .",
    "section [ sec : formula ] provides a formula for the minimum condition number of submatrices when @xmath25 .",
    "section [ sec : neven ] characterizes optimal solutions all for @xmath25 , @xmath53 and arbitrary @xmath54 .",
    "section [ sec : sim ] presents simulations .",
    "let @xmath55 be positive integers and @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath57 obey @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be a subset with cardinality @xmath15 .",
    "now , @xmath61 is the submatrix @xmath62 $ ] with columns indices @xmath63 , @xmath64 , from the set @xmath17 .",
    "then our optimal design problem for the parameter set @xmath65 is : @xmath66 for @xmath25 , this is equivalent to minimizing the condition number : @xmath67    note the similarity between this problem and the problem of designing compressive sensing matrices @xcite satisfying the restricted isometry property ( rip ) , which also requires the condition numbers for the submatrices be small . as opposed to the design of compressive sensing matrices satisfying rip @xcite , in our problem , the submatrices @xmath21 are wide rather than tall .",
    "the motivating applications are also different from compressive sensing .",
    "as noted earlier , motivated in part by 2-dimensional source monitoring with the minimum number of sensors i.e. @xmath53 , we restrict attention to the case of @xmath53 and @xmath25 , where closed form expressions are possible and surprising conclusions , that may illuminate the problem solution for higher values of @xmath7 and @xmath5 , are obtained .",

    ". since @xmath75 we can choose @xmath76 thus @xmath77 let us define @xmath78 then the minimum ( maximum ) eigenvalue of @xmath79 is achieved when @xmath80 and @xmath81 . with @xmath82at",
    "a minimum or maximum , @xmath83 satisfies @xmath84 and @xmath85 thus , @xmath86 combining the optimizing @xmath83 and ( [ eq : jexpansion ] ) , we have @xmath87    on simplification , the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of @xmath79 are given by @xmath88 and @xmath89 respectively . thus minimizing the condition number of @xmath90 for a given set of indices",
    "@xmath91 is the same as ( the equation inside the square root is always nonnegative ) @xmath92    with @xmath93 , the optimal sensing matrix design problem for @xmath25 can be reformulated as , @xmath94    in the following sections , we will derive the optimal design for @xmath53 , which has important applications in location monitoring in sensor networks .",
    "we now consider solutions for @xmath25 , @xmath53 and different values of @xmath2 .      for even - numbered @xmath2 , the optimal design is given as below .",
    "if @xmath53 and @xmath2 is an even number , then the set of angles ( a ) @xmath95 , @xmath96 , or ( b ) @xmath97 , @xmath96 , minimizes the maximum condition number among all sub - matrices with @xmath7 columns .",
