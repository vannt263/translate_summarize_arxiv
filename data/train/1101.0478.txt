    "the importance of the disc multiplier in euclidean harmonic analysis  defined as the operator @xmath1 satisfying the relation @xmath12  was firmly established by fefferman s groundbraking result in @xcite that @xmath1 is not bounded on @xmath13 , @xmath14 , unless @xmath15 .",
    "the operator has since then played a role in other areas of mathematics .",
    "it usually appears whenever one studies convergence properties of eigenfunction expansions for differential operators on manifolds , and it also appears as an extreme endpoint case of bochner  riesz means .",
    "an interesting aspect , however , is that the operator behaves much better when restricted to radial @xmath16-functions . indeed , according to @xcite , the operator is bounded on @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "this result has later been improved in several directions , and we shall recall them one by one in the main text .",
    "a natural analogue of the disc multiplier in the framework of spherical analysis on riemannian symmetric spaces of rank one was introduced by meaney and prestini in the mid-90 s and the study was completed in the paper @xcite with almost sharp statements about the mapping properties of the maximal operator associated with the disc multiplier . in the present paper",
    "we follow in their footsteps and generalize their results to jacobi analysis , and we establish the missing endpoint results in the setting of jacobi analysis .",
    "in particular we complement the paper @xcite .",
    "this implies almost everywhere convergence of @xmath19 for @xmath20 for a certain range of @xmath21 , most directly related to @xcite in the euclidean case , whereas the extension to hankel transforms was considered in @xcite .",
    "there are other ways to obtain almost everywhere convergence of @xmath22 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors obtain equiconvergence results for @xmath23 in the slightly more general framework of ( noncompact ) chbli  trimche hypergroups .",
    "the results of the present paper should generalize to their setting without much effort .",
    "our endpoint results are stronger , however , as we are able to determine the endpoint behavior of the maximal operator at the level of lorentz spaces . moreover , and this is a fundamental advantage of working with maximal operators , we will use the results of the present paper as part of a complex interpolation argument in a companion paper to obtain convergence results for bochner ",
    "riesz means in jacobi analysis below the critical order of integrability . in order for this to work",
    "we need norm estimates in the first place .",
    "finally we wish to point out that a `` flat '' version of our results on the disc multipliers were recently obtained in @xcite . by `` flat ''",
    "we refer to the modern habit of regarding dunkl analysis on @xmath4 as a ` zero curvature limit ' of harmonic analysis in rank one root systems , in the sense of cherednik , heckman and opdam .",
    "the proofs of @xcite are more or less straightforward adaptations of techniques from @xcite and @xcite , since the size of balls , measured in terms of the relevant measures in dunkl theory , do not grow exponentially fast , contrary to what happens for the noncompact riemannian symmetric spaces .",
    "it is well - understood that the `` curved '' situation  be it analysis on symmetric spaces or slightly more generally in jacobi analysis  is complicated by balls having exponential volume growth .",
    "we employ the same techniques as in @xcite , carried out in the more general setting of jacobi analysis .",
    "most proofs are therefore structurally identical to those in @xcite , which we wish to acknowledge at this point .",
    "there are several technical difficulties , however , like the precise asymptotic expansion for the @xmath24-function in lemma [ lemma.precise-c ] .",
    "also of importance was that we were able to incorporate the paper @xcite by prestini .",
    "the careful analysis , in turn , allowed us to establish new endpoint results , thereby showing to exactly what extend one can generalize the spherical analysis on symmetric spaces of rank one .",
    "since we never use the actual formula for the measures @xmath25 , but rather just its behavior for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , and since the key ingredients for the proofs ",
    "asymptotic estimates for @xmath28 and the plancherel density @xmath29  are also available for chbli  trimche hypergroups ( see theorem  1.2 , section  1.3 , theorems  2.1 and 2.2 in @xcite ) the exact same calculations can be carried out in the context of such hypergroups .",

    "it is thereby clear that @xmath40 is analytic for all @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath42 , there exists a unique solution @xmath43 to the same equation satisfying @xmath44 as @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is therefore also analytic for @xmath41 .    in what follows",

    "it follows from stirling s formula that for every @xmath69 there exists a positive constant @xmath70 such that @xmath71 the following statement on the precise asymptotic expansion of the density @xmath29 will play an important role later in the paper .",
    "we have included a detailed proof since the result can not be lifted directly from @xcite or @xcite ; @xmath72 and @xmath73 need not correspond to integer - valued root multiplicities , so the expression for @xmath74 does not really simplify , unlike for rank one symmetric spaces .",
