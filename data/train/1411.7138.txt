    "the disks are formed by lost or accreted material around single stars , but they form at different stages of the evolution if the star is a member of a close binary system : ( a ) during formation of binary , ( b ) during roche lobe overflow in semi detached binaries , ( c ) during high rate of mass loss stage , ( d ) during mass loss from the second lagrangian point in overcontact binaries , ( e ) during merging process of contact binaries , ( f ) during post common envelope stage , and ( g ) during evaporation of the secondary in x ray binaries .",

    "circumbinary planets in p - type orbits around relatively short period 7 unevolved eclipsing binaries ( 0.08 < @xmath0 < 0.23 au ) were discovered by kepler s transit observations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all these circumbinary planets ( except two outer planets of kepler 47 ) were found reside close to the dynamical stability limit boundary ( in average _ _ p__@xmath1 / _ _ p__@xmath2 = 6.88 ) which is very close to inner edge of the circumbinary disks where _ _",

    "altough the mass loss may form disks around contact or overcontact binaries , there is no claim of any circumbinary planet around these systems .",
    "either there are no circumbinary planets around contact binaries , or the observations are not sufficient to detect any such planets , if they exist .    in the present contribution we first simulate the light curves of contact binaries with possible transiting circumbinary jovian planets by considering the physical and geometrical parameters of the circumbinary planets .",
    "we than reconsider the ground based et observations to see if they are capable to detect lite effects of the circumbinary planets around contact binaries .",

    "the light changes of contact binaries with a possible transiting circumbinary jovian planet was simulated .",
    "it is concluded that if the transiting circumbinary planets are present around contact binaries , the relatively large intrinsic light variability , long exposure times and the complexity of the combined low amplitude light variation formed by the transits of the circumbinary planets do not allow yet the disentangling of the transit light curves .",
    "on the other hand , the et precision decreases by the intrinsic variability caused by the enhanced magnetic activity of late type g , k , and m- type binary components , and thus the scatter in the _ o - c _ diagrams increases . the major scatter in the light curves and the _ o - c _ diagrams are caused by the starspot activity .",
    "the time shift in et ( which can be as large as 30 minutes ) caused by starspots is proportional to the photometric wave amplitude , while inversely proportional to the depth of the eclipse minima .",
    "the starspot effect in the _ o - c _ diagram can be minimised by using the average of the minimum i and minimum ii times , or before forming the _ o - c _ diagram , the time shifts in et s can be corrected by spot modelling .    due to relatively large scatter in the _ o - c _ diagrams of contact binaries , the detectable lite amplitudes ( @xmath13__t _ _ ) would be relatively large and thus , as table 1 implies , in practice , only the very high mass planets about @xmath17 = 10 m@xmath16 are detectable around contact binaries by using et ."
