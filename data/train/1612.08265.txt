    "combinatorial optimization problems  @xcite are generally hard to solve since the computational complexity ( the time necessary to reach the solution ) is typically exponential in the problem size  @xcite .",
    "quantum annealing ( qa )  @xcite has been devised as a metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization problems and uses quantum fluctuations for state search in place of thermal fluctuations for the classical counterpart of simulated annealing  @xcite . in its formulation as quantum adiabatic computing  @xcite , the system is supposed to follow the instantaneous ground state of a quantum system , typically the transverse - field ising model , and the final state is expected to be close to the ground state of a classical ising model which encodes the combinatorial optimization problem that one wishes to solve .    since the system is expected to follow the instantaneous ground state as faithfully as possible , it is desirable that the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state is not very small , as a small gap causes a transition between states . in particular ,",
    "if the system encounters a quantum phase transition in the course of annealing , it causes a problem because the gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit . therefore one should carefully check the existence and the type of a possible phase transition .",
    "it is generally the case that a first - order quantum phase transition is characterized by a gap closing exponentially as a function of the system size .",
    "this causes a difficulty for qa because the time necessary to follow the instantaneous ground state depends polynomially on the inverse of the energy gap according to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , at a second - order transition , the gap closes polynomially and thus the computation time grows polynomially as the system size increases .",
    "this is a situation where the problem is considered to be solved easily .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the simple ferromagnetic ising model with @xmath0-body infinite - range interactions has a first order phase transition as a function of the strength of the transverse field .",
    "this implies that the trivial ferromagnetic ground state can not be reached easily by qa .",
    "this serious problem has been shown to be circumvented in refs .",
    "@xcite by the introduction of a non - stoquastic term into the hamiltonian , by which first - order phase transitions are reduced to second order .",
    "a similar phenomenon has been observed in the hopfield model @xcite .",
    "a stoquastic hamiltonian is defined as a hamiltonian operator whose matrix representation has its off - diagonal elements all non - positive in an appropriate basis , usually the computational basis to diagonalize the @xmath1 component of the pauli matrix at each site  @xcite .",
    "this means that a system with a stoquastic hamiltonian can generally be simulated easily classically by using the suzuki - trotter decomposition  @xcite .",
    "a non - stoquastic hamiltonian violates the above condition of non - positive off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "let us call a term in the hamiltonian non - stoquastic if the term generates positive off - diagonal elements in the standard computational basis .",
    "it is generally difficult to classically simulate a system with a non - stoquastic hamiltonian because of the sign problem in the effective boltzmann factor  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of first - order transitions to second order by a non - stoquastic term in the @xmath0-body interacting ferromagnetic ising model suggests that a term that can not be simulated easily classically would potentially enhance the efficiency of quantum annealing significantly , which is obviously a remarkable effect .",

    "although the reduction of first - order transitions to second order by a non - stoquastic term can be correctly described by statistical - mechanical calculations valid in the thermodynamic limit , where the ( semi-)classical picture is justified , it is not easy to extract subtle quantum effects , which may ( or may not ) play a crucial role , from direct statistical - mechanical computations",

    "we also compute the concurrence , representing the degree of entanglement between two spins in the system .",

    "[ fig : trace_norm_dist_2 ] ( a ) . here , we see quantitative differences among different values of @xmath23 , but it is not necessarily clear whether or not there exists a qualitative difference .",
    "it is anyway true that the ferromagnetic phase for small @xmath23 ( i.e. , a large coefficient of the non - stoquastic term ) has a ground state significantly different from the spin - coherent state .",
    "these results show that the state of the system is far from the spin - coherent state around the transition , and such a range of the parameter @xmath5 is wider for second - order transitions .",
    "the paramagnetic phase , which exists at small @xmath5 for any @xmath23 , is very well described by the semi - classical spin - coherent state for any @xmath23 . however , the ferromagnetic phase , which occupies the upper half of the phase diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] , shows deviations from the spin - coherent state for small values of @xmath23 . in other words ,",
    "the non - stoquastic term @xmath66 with a large coefficient causes noticeable departures of the ground state wave function from the semi - classical spin - coherent state at a phase transition and within the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "it is premature to conclude that these deviations of the ground state from the spin - coherent state caused by the non - stoquastic term are the _ sole _ origin of the reduction of a first - order transition to second order because the case of @xmath55 has no second - order transition but the ferromagnetic phase for @xmath37 has a different state from the spin - coherent state as is evident in panel ( e ) .",
    "it is useful to remember here that the system with @xmath55 is special in the sense that a simple landau - type argument precludes a second - order transition by the introduction of a cubic term in the landau expansion of the free energy , @xmath67 for larger values of @xmath68 , the leading two terms of the landau expansion would be quadratic and quartic in @xmath69 , @xmath70 which leads to the possibility of a second - order transition when the coefficient @xmath71 is small .",
    "it is anyway true that the non - stoquastic term promotes deviations from the semi - classical spin - coherent state at the transition as well as in the ferromagnetic phase , and the order of transition may be reduced from first to second when a few additional conditions are satisfied ( or a few detrimental conditions are removed ) .",
    "to further understand the role of quantum effects introduced by the non - stoquastic term , we evaluate the degree of entanglement represented by the concurrence .",
    "this is a quantity to measure how much two sites are entangled in a system .",
    "the stoquastic case has already been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is found that three different measures of entanglement , _",
    "i.e. _ concurrence , entanglement entropy , and negativity , behave similarly in the sense that , when the concurrence has a jump at a first - order transition , so do the other two measures . also , a sharp peak in the concurrence is observed when the entanglement entropy is divergent or the negativity is sharply peaked at a second - order transition .",
    "thus the type of transition and the degree of quantum fluctuations can be inferred by any one of the three measures in the present mean - field - type model with infinite - range interactions @xcite .",
    "this is in deviation from the case of finite dimensions where the entanglement entropy has a distinct feature to detect if the entanglement extends beyond the interface region between two parts of the system .",
    "we use the concurrence , not the more standard entanglement entropy , to distinguish different types of behavior of entanglement because the concurrence , which remains finite at a second - order transition , has weaker dependence on the system parameters ( size and coefficients in the hamiltonian ) and it is therefore harder to detect qualitative differences for different types of phase transitions by the concurrence .",
    "if we are able to see clear qualitative differences in the behavior of the concurrence between different values of @xmath23 , it would serve as clear evidence that the entanglement plays different roles in different types of transitions .    the concurrence @xmath72 , for a given density matrix @xmath73 , is defined by  @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are the square roots of the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of the product matrix @xmath77 with @xmath78 being the complex conjugate of @xmath73 . since our hamiltonian ( [ eq : total_hamiltonian ] ) has infinite - range interactions , all sites are equivalent , and thus we may choose any pair of sites @xmath79 to calculate the concurrence . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we consider the rescaled concurrence @xmath80 defined by @xmath81 to extract non - trivial values .",
    "since the system is likely to behave classically in the leading order of system size , i.e. in the thermodynamic limit , the value of concurrence vanishes in the leading order .",
    "we should evaluate the next - order correction to identify the subtle quantum symptoms , which is reflected in the definition of the rescaled concurrence in eq .",
    "( [ rescaled_concurrence ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : concurrence_1 ] shows the rescaled concurrence as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "the behavior may look similar to the corresponding data for the trace - norm distance in fig .",
    "[ fig : trace_norm_dist ] , but there exist subtle but important differences .",
    "it is seen in panels ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) , and ( g ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : concurrence_1 ] that the rescaled concurrence assumes nonzero values in the ferromagnetic phase for the non - stoquastic case . to check if those finite values persist in the limit of large system size at @xmath7 , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : concurrence_2 ] ( a ) the rescaled concurrence as a function of the inverse of the system size for various values of @xmath23 .",
    "they all indicate a finite value in the limit of large system size , and the limiting value is a monotonic function of @xmath23 , a larger value for smaller @xmath23 .",
    "thus the non - stoquastic term enhances entanglement not just at a transition point but also within the ferromagnetic phase for small @xmath23 ( larger coefficient of the non - stoquastic term ) as expected from the analysis of the trace - norm distance .",
    "panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : concurrence_2 ] shows the maximum value of the rescaled concurrence observed at the transition point plotted as a function of @xmath82 .",
    "it is seen that the tendency is clearly classified to two types .",
    "the maximum increases monotonically and approaches a finite value close to 2 for second - order transitions ( @xmath83 ) whereas it decreases toward a very small value in the first - order cases ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this is an important _ qualitative _ difference between the two cases .",
    "this definitely shows that a second - order transition is characterized by a finite amount of entanglement whereas quantum effects are much weaker , almost negligible for @xmath35 , at a first - order transition .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a discontinuity in the concurrence at a first - order transition is closely related with a corresponding discontinuity in the derivative of the ground - state energy . plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen_energy_p11_n512 ] is the instantaneous energy spectrum for the case of @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .     around the first order transition at @xmath39 ( vertical dotted line ) .",

    "[ fig : concurrence_1 ] ( a ) .",
    "another interesting aspect of the energy spectrum is the existence of a cascade of possible diabatic transitions from the ground state at smaller @xmath87 toward higher and higher excited states beyond the transition point @xmath88 .",
    "there does not exist a backward cascade toward the ground state at a later stage of annealing ( larger @xmath5 ) in contrast to the example found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this sense , the present model in the stoquastic limit ( @xmath65 ) with a first order transition may be taken as a hard problem to solve even by an ingenious diabatic control of the system evolution .",
    "similar properties hold for the non - stoquatic case with a first - order transition .",
    "we have seen that the non - stoquastic term appended to the hamiltonian reduces first - order phase transitions to second order in the @xmath0-body interacting ising model with @xmath89 .",
    "the phase diagram obtained from the semi - classical potential using the spin - coherent state agrees very accurately with the phase diagram drawn by a quantum statistical - mechanical method . we can thus conclude that the location of phase transitions can reliably be predicted by the classical analysis",
    "this sounds natural because the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : total_hamiltonian ] ) is written only in terms of the total spin operators , @xmath90 which commute in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath91 = \\frac{2i}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{\\sigma}_i^y \\longrightarrow 0 \\quad ( n\\to\\infty),\\ ] ] and thus can be regarded as the corresponding components of a classical unit vector .",
    "the reduction of a first - order transition to second order at small @xmath23 ( large coefficient of the non - stoquastic term ) can then be explained without reference to quantum mechanics .",
    "critical fluctuations in the classical sense exist at around second - order transitions .",
    "then , a natural question arises why we need quantum mechanics in the analysis of the present model .",
    "the answer is the finite - size effects .",
    "the annealing time of an adiabatic process crucially depends on the minimum energy gap , which is zero at a phase transition of any order in the thermodynamic limit but is finite for finite - size systems .",
    "we therefore have to carefully scrutinize the finite - size effects at around a phase transition to understand the origin of the reduction of computational complexity coming from the reduction of the order of transition from first to second .",
    "the rescaled concurrence suits this purpose to extract subtle finite - size effects since it represents the next - to - leading order correction in @xmath82 of the concurrence itself as is evident in the definition of eq .",
    "( [ rescaled_concurrence ] ) .",
    "we have seen that the maximum of the rescaled concurrence approaches a relatively large value at second - order transitions whereas it remains very small for the first - order case .",
    "this is a clear signature that quantum effects , entanglement , prevail at around second - order transitions .",
    "also , the data of the trace - norm distance indicate that the semi - classical spin - coherent state is short to describe the true quantum ground state at around a second - order transition . in contrast , the trace - norm distance decays quickly away from a first - order transition point though it is large exactly at the transition point .",
    "we thus conclude that the reduction of the order of transition shows up hand in hand with the emergence of noticeable signatures of quantum effects",
    ".    it may be appropriate to note here that the existence of significant _ quantum _ fluctuations at a transition is not necessarily a trivial consequence of the second - order transition .",
    "significant fluctuations already exist at a classical level , which is necessary and sufficient to characterize the classical transition as second order .",
    "persistence of fluctuations to the sub - leading quantum level may be possible intuitively but should be confirmed explicitly , which we have done .",
    "it is still under debate if the existence of entanglement is closely related with the enhanced performance of quantum annealing with favorable @xcite and unfavorable @xcite examples .",
    "we have given an interesting example by semi - analytical calculations ( i.e. without recourse to extensive numerical computations ) that a non - stoquastic term , which can not be simulated easily classically , enhances the entanglement and , at the same time , reduces the computation time enormously from exponential ( first - order transition ) to polynomial ( second order ) .",
    "still , further studies would be necessary as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another interesting result is that the persistence of non - classical features , large values of the trace - norm distance and the reduced concurrence , within the ferromagnetic phase far away from the transition point when @xmath23 is small .",
    "we have so far been unable to explain this fact intuitively leave it to future studies .",

    "<S> we study the relation between quantum fluctuations and the significant enhancement of the performance of quantum annealing in a non - stoquastic mean - field hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> first - order quantum phase transitions were shown to be reduced to second - order by a non - stoquastic term in a mean - field - type many - body - interacting ising spin system in a transverse field , which means an exponential speedup of quantum annealing by adiabatic quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate if and how quantum effects manifest themselves at around these first- and second - order phase transitions to understand if the non - stoquastic term appended to the conventional transverse - field ising model induces notable quantum effects . by measuring the proximity of the semi - classical spin - coherent state to the true ground state as well as the magnitude of the concurrence representing entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that significant quantum fluctuations exist at around second - order transitions whereas quantum effects are much less prominent at first - order transitions . </S>",
    "<S> although the location of transition point can be accurately predicted by the classical picture , system properties near the transition needs quantum - mechanical descriptions for a second order transition but not necessarily so for first order . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that quantum fluctuations are large within the ferromagnetic phase after a second - order transition from the paramagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the non - stoquastic term induces marked quantum effects , and it is likely to be related closely with the significant enhancement of the performance of quantum annealing . </S>"
