    "how to extract energy from a rotating black hole is an interesting and important issue in astrophysics . for a kerr black hole , up to @xmath1 of its total energy ( i.e. all of its rotational energy ) is available for extraction in principle ( christodoulou 1970 ) .",
    "penrose ( 1969 ) was the first to propose a gedankenexperiment for extracting energy from a kerr black hole by splitting a particle into two inside the ergosphere : one particle with negative energy ( relative to observers at infinity ) is captured by the black hole , the other with energy greater than that of the original particle escapes to infinity .",
    "however , the penrose process has been argued to be impractical in astrophysics since it requires the two new - born particles separate from each other with speed greater than half of the light speed ( bardeen , press , & teukolsky 1972 ; wald 1974 ) . since",
    "then many people have considered various alternative mechanisms for extracting energy from a rotating black hole . among them",
    "the most promising one is the blandford - znajek mechanism ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , which in fact has been proposed to be a possible process for powering jets in quasars and active galactic nuclei ( rees , begelman , blandford , & phinney 1982 ; begelman , blandford , & rees 1984 ) and gamma - ray bursts ( paczyski 1993 ; mszros & rees 1997 ; lee , wijers , & brown 2000 ) . in the blandford - znajek mechanism , a kerr black hole is assumed to connect with remote loads with magnetic field lines .",
    "the magnetic field lines thread the black hole s horizon , the rotation of the black hole twists the magnetic field lines and transports energy and angular momentum from the black hole to the loads ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; macdonald & thorne 1982 ; phinney 1983 ) . recently ,",
    "a variant picture has been considered : instead of connecting with remote loads , the magnetic field lines are assumed to connect a kerr black hole with a disk surrounding it ( blandford 1999 ; gruzinov 1999 ; li 2000 ) .",
    "if the black hole rotates faster than the disk , energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and transferred to the disk and ultimately radiated away by the disk ( li 2000 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider a new scenario for extracting energy from a kerr black hole .",
    "assume some magnetic field lines connect plasma particles inside the ergosphere of a kerr black hole with remote loads .",
    "because of the frame dragging of the kerr black hole , plasma fluid inside the ergosphere always has a positive angular velocity relative to observers at infinity (  positive \" means that the angular velocity of the plasma particles and the angular velocity of the black hole have the same sign ) . because of the rotation of the plasma fluid , energy and angular momentum are extracted from the plasma particles by the magnetic field lines and transported to the remote loads .",
    "if the magnetic field is strong enough , so much energy can be extracted that as the particles fall into the horizon they have negative energy relative to observers at infinity .",
    "so , effectively , the energy is extracted from the black hole .",
    "the particles inside the ergosphere can be continuously replenished with accretion from a disk surrounding the black hole , so a transition region with sufficient amount of plasma particles is formed between the black hole s horizon and the inner edge of the disk . thus energy can be continuously extracted from the black hole through the transition region .",
    "we will show that this may be the most efficient way for extracting energy from a kerr black hole : in principle almost all of its rotational energy ( up to @xmath0 of its total energy ) can be extracted .",
    "similar processes inside the ergosphere have been considered by other people , who have assumed that magnetic field lines connect an accretion disk either with particles in the transition region ( gammie 1999 ; agol & krolik 2000 ; however see the critical comments of paczyski 2000 , and armitage , reynolds , & chiang 2000 ) or with remote loads ( meier 1999 ) .",
    "then the accreting particles can fall into the black hole with negative energy and negative angular momentum if the magnetic coupling is strong enough , so energy and angular momentum flow from the black hole into the disk .",
    "while in our scenario , the magnetic field lines connect particles in the transition region with remote loads without going through the disk . the energy extracted from the black hole",
    "is transported to infinity through the transition region instead of going through the disk .",
    "consider some magnetic field lines connecting plasma fluid inside the ergosphere of a kerr black hole with remote loads .",
    "the foot - points of the magnetic field lines in the plasma fluid are supposed to be close to the event horizon of the black hole , where the angular velocity of the fluid is @xmath2 because of the frame dragging , where @xmath3 is the angular velocity of the black hole ( misner , thorne , & wheeler 1973 ) .",
    "the electromotive force induced in the plasma fluid by the frame dragging is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the magnetic flux threading the plasma .",
    "we use the geometric units with @xmath6 throughout the paper .",
    "the power on the loads ( i.e. the energy extracted per unit time from the fluid in the transition region , which is measured by observers at infinity ) is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the resistance of the loads , @xmath9 is the resistance of the plasma fluid , and @xmath10 is the angular velocity of the magnetic field lines .",
    "the torque on the loads ( i.e. the angular momentum extracted per unit time from the fluid in the transition region , which is measured by observers at infinity ) is @xmath11 .",
    "if the plasma inside the ergosphere is perfectly conducting so @xmath9 is small , @xmath12 can easily reach a big value for a wide range of @xmath8 : from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the resistance of the black hole which is @xmath16 .",
    "in other words , we do not need `` impedance - matching ''  which is needed by the blandford - znajek mechanism ( macdonald & thorne 1982 ) .",
    "the plasma particles inside the ergosphere are continuously replenished with accretion from a disk surrounding the black hole with accretion rate @xmath17 ( measured by observers at infinity ) . in a steady state ,",
    "the black hole must capture particles at the same rate .",
    "if the particles captured by the black hole have negative energy ( measured by observers at infinity ; we use the convention @xmath18 for accretion ) , energy is extracted from the black hole . in a steady state the power and the torque of the black hole are respectively @xmath19 where @xmath12 is given by equation ( [ pow ] ) , @xmath20 assuming @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the specific energy ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is the specific angular momentum , of the particles before they enter the transition region .",
    "when @xmath25 , we have @xmath26 , the particles fall into the black hole with negative energy , so energy is extracted from the black hole implies @xmath27 . but the reverse is incorrect : a particle with negative angular momentum inside the ergosphere does not have to have negative energy , so @xmath27 does not imply @xmath26 .",
    "the angular velocity of a particle inside the ergosphere is always positive , no matter its energy ( or angular momentum ) is positive or negative . ] .",
    "however , the angular velocity of the particles inside the ergosphere is always positive and so energy is continuously extracted from the particles and transported to the remote loads until the particles fall into the black hole .",
    "( the fluid - lines of the plasma particles in the transition region are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . )    for a fast rotating black hole with @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath30 is the angular momentum of the black hole , the magnitude of @xmath12 can be estimated as @xmath31 if @xmath14 as in the case of the blandford - znajek mechanism , where @xmath32 is the strength of the magnetic field in the transition region , @xmath33 is the radius of the black hole s horizon . by absorbing all ambiguous factors ( with order of magnitude @xmath34 ) into @xmath32 and @xmath35 , the condition for @xmath26 is given by @xmath36 , or @xmath37 where @xmath38 g / s is the eddington limit of accretion rate .",
    "suppose energy and angular momentum are extracted from a kerr black hole at rates @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . as the black hole s",
    "spin @xmath41 goes down from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , the total energy extracted from the black hole is @xmath44 , where @xmath29 is the black hole s initial mass , @xmath45 is the efficiency for the process which can be calculated by ( li 2000 ) @xmath46 where @xmath47 measures the step - by - step efficiency in extracting energy from the black hole .",
    "the value of @xmath48 depends on the process . for the process described in the previous section , @xmath49 with the assumptions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . for @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "we have @xmath54 . compared with the blandford - znajek mechanism and the magnetic coupling between a black hole and its disk ( li 2000 ) , the precess presented in this paper is most efficient in extracting energy from a kerr black hole . in principle , the amount of energy that can be extracted from a kerr black hole through the transition region can be as close as we want to the total rotational energy , which is up to @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism can extract @xmath57 , the magnetic coupling between a black hole and its disk can extract @xmath58 for @xmath52 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . )    by the first law of black hole mechanics we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the surface gravity of the black hole , @xmath61 is the surface area of the black hole s horizon .",
    "the term @xmath62 represents the rate of energy dissipation in the black hole , i.e. the increase in the black hole s entropy .",
    "the second law of black hole physics says @xmath63 always .",
    "[ for the four laws of black hole mechanics see bardeen , carter , & hawking ( 1973 ) .",
    "] so , to gain a high efficiency in extracting energy from a kerr black hole , @xmath64 should be as close as possible to @xmath3 , but keep less than @xmath3 .",
    "for the process discussed in this paper , with @xmath51 , we have @xmath65 which is close to but less than @xmath3 near the horizon of the black hole .",
    "so through the transition region  whose inner boundary is at the black hole s horizon  we can get the highest efficiency in extracting energy from a kerr black hole .",
    "the black hole spins down as it loses angular momentum .",
    "however , it can spin up again through accretion from the disk ( bardeen 1970 ) . by alternating the spin - up process associated with accretion and the spin - down process associated with magnetic braking ,",
    "an indefinite cyclic process can be constructed with the black hole s",
    "spin @xmath41 oscillating between @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( li & paczyski 2000 ) . in each cycle",
    "the overall efficiency in converting mass into energy is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the energy radiated in the spin - up phase , @xmath70 is the energy radiated in the spin - down phase , and @xmath71 is the mass accreted from the disk during the spin - up phase .",
    "( in the spin - down phase the mass accreted from the disk is assumed to be negligible . ) @xmath69 can be calculated with equations in bardeen ( 1970 ) , @xmath70 can be calculated with @xmath72 where @xmath45 is given by equation ( [ eff ] ) .",
    "we find that , @xmath73 peaks at @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . in each cycle the black hole s mass increases @xmath78 .",
    "if we restrict @xmath43 in the interval @xmath79 , as suggested by thorne ( 1974 ) given by the third law of black hole physics is 1 ( bardeen , carter , & hawking 1973 ) . ] , then @xmath73 peaks at @xmath80 and @xmath81 , but @xmath82 does nt change much : @xmath83 . in this case",
    "the black hole s mass increases @xmath84 per cycle . this efficiency is higher than that in the case with the black hole spun - down by the magnetic coupling with the disk , which is @xmath85 ( li & paczyski 2000 ) .    in realistic cases ,",
    "magnetic field lines distribute over the transition region instead of touching the transition region exactly at the inner boundary .",
    "then the averaged angular velocity of the magnetic field lines @xmath86 is smaller than @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath87 , thus the total efficiency in extracting energy from the black hole is smaller than that estimated above . from equation ( [ eff ] ) , for fixed values of @xmath43 and @xmath42 , @xmath45 increases as @xmath48 increases from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "the blandford - znajek mechanism has @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "thus , if the averaged value of @xmath48 lies between @xmath92 and @xmath89 , the mechanism of extracting energy from a black hole through the transition region has a higher efficiency than the blandford - znajek mechanism does .",
    "otherwise , the mechanism of extracting energy from a black hole through the transition region has a lower efficiency .",
    "@xmath54 provides an upper limit for the efficiency in extracting energy from a kerr black hole , as originally shown by christodoulou ( 1970 ) .",
    "as plasma particles in a magnetized accretion disk accrete onto a black hole , the magnetic field lines frozen in the plasma drift toward the black hole together . since a black hole can not hold magnetic fields by itself , excess magnetic field lines coming with the accreting plasma will be expelled from the black hole when the magnetic flux threading the black hole s horizon gets saturated .",
    "so , we can expect that as accretion goes on , in the transition region between the horizon of the black hole and the inner boundary of the disk a strong magnetic field will be built up near the black hole s horizon",
    ". this magnetic field could be stronger than both the magnetic field on the black hole s horizon and the magnetic field in the accretion disk .",
    "along with the accretion of the plasma particles , the toroidal currents in the disk accrete onto the black hole .",
    "as these currents get into the black hole , they are quickly dissipated since a black hole is a poor conductor . accompanying the dissipation of currents , some magnetic field lines diffuse from the black hole to the transition region , which is equivalent to accumulation of toroidal currents in the transition region .",
    "the toroidal currents accumulated in the transition region sustain the magnetic field in the transition region and the magnetic field on the black hole s horizon .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamics inside the transition region is very complicated .",
    "however , in a steady state with low accretion rate , the plasma in the transition region is expected to have a density @xmath93 , which provides sufficient amount of plasma particles for carrying poloidal currents flowing across the magnetic field lines ( krolik 1999 ) .    for a kerr black hole , the inner part of the transition region is inside the ergosphere .",
    "in fact , for a kerr black hole with a thin keplerian disk , the whole transition region is inside the ergosphere when @xmath94 . because of the frame dragging the plasma fluid inside",
    "the ergosphere always has a positive angular velocity .",
    "if the magnetic field lines threading the transition region inside the ergosphere connect with remote astrophysical loads , energy and angular momentum can be extracted from the transition region by magnetic braking . when the accretion rate is low and the magnetic field is strong enough",
    ", so much energy can be extracted that the plasma particles fall into the black hole s horizon with negative energy",
    ". then the energy is essentially extracted from the black hole , though the magnetic field lines relevant to this process do nt touch the black hole at all .",
    "this provides a new scenario for extracting energy from a kerr black hole with some interesting features : ( 1 ) since the resistance in the transition region can be much smaller than that of the black hole , and the angular velocity of the plasma fluid near the black hole horizon is close to @xmath3 , the efficiency in extracting energy from the black hole can be very high  in an optimal case it can be close to the limit @xmath0 for a kerr black hole with initial @xmath56 ; ( 2 ) since inside the ergosphere particles with negative energy must be captured by the black hole , the energy extracted in this way is expected to be cleaner than that extracted from the disk ; ( 3 ) since the transition region has a small resistance , a high power can be gained more easily than that in the blandford - znajek mechanism ."
