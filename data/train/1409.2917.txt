    "we report theoretical and experimental results for the photoionization of ag - like xe@xmath0 ions which were measured at the ion photon beam ( ipb ) end station of beamline 10.0.2.at the advanced light source ( als ) in berkeley , california .",
    "xe@xmath14 is of particular interest because of its quasi - single - electron nature and , hence , its potential as a test case for understanding fundamental aspects of atomic processes .",
    "compared with the only previous experimental study of single photoionization of xe@xmath0 carried out by bizau and co - workers @xcite , the present cross - sections were obtained at higher energy resolution ( 65  mev versus more than 700 mev ) and on an absolute cross - section scale .",
    "preliminary experimental results from the present study were reported by schippers  @xcite . in the photon energy range of 95 - 145 ev covered by the experiment the cross section is dominated by resonances associated with @xmath15 excitations with @xmath16 and subsequent autoionization .",
    "the high - precision cross - section measurements carried out at the als are compared with large - scale theoretical calculations within the confines of the dirac coulomb r - matrix approximation  @xcite . for the computations the dirac atomic r - matrix codes package ( darc ) was employed using progressively larger expansions in the close - coupling calculations .",
    "the results provide suitable representations of photoionization of the @xmath17 ground and metastable @xmath18 levels of ag - like xe@xmath0 ions , the latter of which are excited by about 32.9  ev  @xcite above the ground state .",
    "in addition to the direct photoionization process removing the outermost @xmath19 or @xmath20 electron , the following indirect excitation processes can occur for the interaction of a photon with the @xmath19 ground - state and the @xmath20 metastable levels of the xe@xmath0 ion : @xmath21 where the term angular momentum l is 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 ( i.e. p , d , f , g or h ) of the excited xenon ion .",
    "the contributing principal quantum numbers @xmath22 ( which can be as low as @xmath23 for the metastable initial state ) depend on the orbital quantum number @xmath24 ( predominantly @xmath25 or 1 ) of the subshell to which the @xmath26 electron is excited . the intermediate resonance states can then decay by autoionization to the ground state or other energy - accessible excited states of xe@xmath27 .",

    "the xe@xmath0 ions required for the present experiment were produced from natural xenon gas inside a compact 10 ghz all - permanent - magnet electron - cyclotron - resonance ion source placed at a positive potential of + 6 kv .",
    "after extraction and acceleration of the ions to a kinetic energy of 42  kev the ion beam was deflected by a 60@xmath28 dipole magnet selecting ions of the desired ratio of charge to mass .",
    "collimated isotope - resolved @xmath29xe@xmath0 ion beams with electrical currents of up to 15  na were passed through the photon - ion merged - beam interaction region . by applying appropriate voltages to several electrostatic steering and focusing devices",
    "the ion beam was aligned along the axis of the counter - propagating photon beam .",
    "downstream of the interaction region , the ion beam was deflected out of the photon - beam direction by a second dipole magnet that also separated the ionized xe@xmath30 product ions from the xe@xmath31 parent ions .",
    "the xe@xmath30 ions were counted with a single - particle detector of nearly 100% efficiency  @xcite , and the xe@xmath31 ion beam was collected in a faraday cup monitoring the ion current for normalization purposes .",
    "the measured xe@xmath30 count rate did not result completely from photoionization events .",
    "although the interaction region was maintained at ultra - high vacuum , the product ion beam also contained xe@xmath30 ions produced by electron - loss collisions with residual gas molecules and surfaces .",
    "for the determination of absolute cross sections this background was subtracted by employing time modulation ( mechanical chopping ) of the photon beam .",

    "the numerical values of the overlaps and the total form factor of the specific measurement are given in the respective panels .",
    ", width=340 ]    absolute cross sections were obtained by normalizing the background - subtracted xe@xmath30 photo - ion yield to the measured ion current , to the photon flux which was determined using a calibrated photodiode , and to the geometrical beam overlap .",
    "the latter was optimized by employing two commercial rotating - wire beam - profile monitors located in front of and behind the interaction region .",
    "the effective length of 29.4  cm of the interaction region is defined by a drift tube which , in the present experiment , was set to a potential of -1.5  kv with respect to the surrounding grounded electrodes and the vacuum vessel . by this potential ,",
    "the xe@xmath30 ions produced inside the drift tube are energy - tagged .",
    "they emerge with a kinetic energy of 42  kev+7e@xmath371.5  kv-8e@xmath371.5  kv = 40.5  kev , where @xmath38 is the electrical charge of the entering ions and @xmath39 is the electrical charge of the exiting ions .",
    "xe@xmath30 ions born outside the interaction region maintain their original energy of 42  kev .",
    "the demerging magnet and a subsequent spherical electrostatic energy analyzer easily separates xe@xmath30 ions with energies of 40.5 and 42 kev , respectively , from one another .",
    "the overlap of the merged beams is quantified by the form factor  @xcite which was determined by scanning narrow slits across the two beams at three positions along the beam axes , at the entrance , the middle and the exit of the interaction region . due to the considerable effort required for carrying out reliable absolute cross - section measurements , these were performed at only a few photon energies at selected resonance maxima . by comparison of these absolute measurements with the photo - ion - yield spectrum",
    "a constant normalization factor was determined matching the yield spectrum to the absolute cross sections .",
    "the scatter in the ratios of absolute cross sections and associated photo - ion - yields is much smaller than the relative systematic uncertainty of each absolute measurement .    to illustrate the absolute measurements ,",
    "experimental form - factor data taken at a photon energy of 122.14  ev are shown in figure  [ formfactor ] .",
    "for this specific measurement the monochromator slits were set to 59.9  @xmath40 m at the entrance and 176.6  @xmath40 m at the exit position resulting in a photon - energy resolution of 65  mev .",
    "the current measured at the photodiode was 81.75  @xmath40a corresponding to a photon flux of 3.37@xmath4110@xmath42  s@xmath43 .",
    "the electrical ion current of 1.44  na produced detector background of ( @xmath44 )  s@xmath43 mainly by collisions of xe@xmath31 with residual gas particles resulting in the production of xe@xmath30 ions .",
    "the photoionization signal rate after background subtraction was ( @xmath45 )  s@xmath43 .",
    "the cross section resulting from this particular measurement taken with a form factor f = 1244  cm@xmath43 is 965  mb with a statistical uncertainty of 2.3% .",
    "the error budget of absolute measurements at the ipb endstation has been previously discussed in detail by covington  @xcite .",
    "different from their experiment , a much more efficient single - particle detector  @xcite was employed in the present measurements .",
    "uncertainties associated with the product ion detection including product - ion collection were substantially reduced from a total of about 11% to a new total of only 5% .",
    "the resulting total systematic error of the present absolute cross - section determination is estimated to be @xmath6 19% at 90% confidence .",
    "the energy scale was calibrated by first applying a doppler correction to account for the motion of the xe@xmath31 parent ions .",
    "the monochromator calibration was determined by measurements of the photo - ions produced in photoionization of ar gas in the vicinity of the ar @xmath47 edge which was observed in second - and third - order light from the monochromator .",
    "the ar photoabsorption spectrum covers characteristic and distinct features in the energy range from about 244 to 250  ev .",
    "observations of these features with second - order light were made in the nominal energy range 122 to 124.5  ev and with third - order light in the energy range 82.1 to 82.9  ev .",
    "the resulting resonance positions were compared with the measurements carried out by king @xcite and ren  @xcite .",
    "king @xcite employed electron - energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) with 1.5  kev electrons at about 70  mev resolution reaching an accuracy for the @xmath48 resonance of 10  mev at 244.39  ev , that was unsurpassed for decades until a few years ago .",
    "ren  @xcite also measured electron - energy - loss spectra with a resolution of 55  mev using 2500  ev electrons scattered from ar at 0@xmath28 and 4@xmath28 . with improved energy resolution and better statistics they were able to provide the same energy of 244.390  ev for the @xmath48 resonance but with an uncertainty of only 4  mev , i.e. , a factor of two and a half better than king .",
    "the comparison of the present photoabsorption energies in second and third order with the literature values showed deviations between -23 mev near 82  ev and + 53  mev near 122  ev . by applying a linear correction to the nominal photon energies of the present experiment an uncertainty of the overall energy calibration of @xmath6 10 mev",
    "is estimated . since the dominating xe@xmath0 photoionization resonance found in the present experiment to be at an energy of 122.139 ev almost coincides in position with the energy to be expected in the second - order observation of the ar(@xmath48 resonance , known to be at 122.195 ev",
    ", we conclude that the calibrated energy scale has a conservatively estimated uncertainty of better than @xmath49 5 mev at the position of the xe@xmath50 resonance .",
    "for comparison with high - resolution measurements such as those carried out in the present study , state - of - the - art theoretical methods using highly correlated wavefunctions are required that include relativistic effects and thus provide quantitative results on fine - structure level splitting .",
    "an efficient parallel version @xcite of the darc  @xcite suite of codes has been developed @xcite to address the challenge of electron and photon interactions with atomic systems supporting the inclusion of hundreds of levels and thousands of scattering channels .",
    "metastable states are populated in the xe@xmath0 ion beam experiments requiring additional theoretical calculations .",
    "recent modifications to the darc codes  @xcite facilitate high quality photoionization cross - section calculations for heavy complex systems of interest to astrophysics and other plasma applications .",
    "previously , cross - section calculations for single photoionization of trans - fe elements such as se@xmath51 , xe@xmath51 and kr@xmath51 ions  @xcite have been made using this modified darc code illustrating excellent agreement with the available experimental measurements .",

    "one - electron system with a single @xmath52 electron outside filled sub - shells in the ground level or a single @xmath20 electron in the first metastable excited level that contributes to the experimental cross section .",
    "complexity immediately emerges when a @xmath26 electron is excited producing atomic configurations with typically 3 open sub - shells with relatively high angular momenta .",
    "photoionization cross - section calculations for xe@xmath0 were performed for the ground ( @xmath53 ) and the excited metastable ( @xmath54 ) levels with a progressively larger number of states in our close - coupling work to benchmark our theoretical results with the present high resolution experimental measurements .",
    "the atomic structure calculations were carried out using the grasp code @xcite .",

    "we investigated the convergence of this model by incorporating the additional configuration @xmath67 which gave rise to a total of 526-levels .",
    "models were also investigated where we left out the @xmath68 orbital in the ground and metastable states and incorporated a @xmath69 configuration .",
    "photoionization cross - section calculations were then performed using the darc codes for the different scattering models for the ground @xmath70 state of the xe@xmath0 ion ( with 249 , 508 and 526 levels ) in order to gauge convergence of the models .",
    "the darc photoionization cross - section calculations for the metastable @xmath71 levels were restricted to a 528-level model .",
    "the r - matrix boundary radius of 12.03 bohr radii was sufficient to envelop the radial extent of all the n=6 atomic orbitals of the xe@xmath0 ion .",
    "a basis of 16 continuum orbitals was sufficient to span the incident experimental photon energy range from threshold up to 150 ev .",
    "since dipole selection rules apply , total ground - state photoionization requires only the bound - free dipole matrices , @xmath72 . for the excited metastable states ,",
    "@xmath73 and @xmath74 are necessary .    for the ground and metastable initial states , the outer region electron - ion collision problem was solved ( in the resonance region below and between all thresholds ) using a suitably chosen fine energy mesh of 1.5@xmath3710@xmath75 rydbergs ( @xmath76 0.2 @xmath77ev ) to fully resolve all the extremely narrow resonance structure in the photoionization cross sections .",
    "the @xmath78-coupled hamiltonian diagonal matrices were adjusted so that the theoretical term energies matched the recommended nist values  @xcite .",
    "we note that this energy adjustment ensures better positioning of certain resonances relative to all thresholds included in the calculation @xcite .",

    "a posteriori , the discussion shows that a small fraction @xmath145 of metastable ions accompanied the large fraction @xmath146 of ground - state ions in the parent ion beam .",
    "so , in fact the apparent experimental cross section is that for a mixture of ionic levels .",
    "the real cross section for metastable ions can in principle be obtained by normalizing the apparent cross section for signal arising from the metastable ions to the fraction @xmath145 .",
    "thus , the present discussion addresses the size of that fraction @xmath145 .",
    "the total oscillator strength found in the experiment in the energy range 95 - 105 ev is only 2.4% of what theory finds in that same range .",
    "a comparably small fraction @xmath145 of metastable ions in the parent ion beam must be concluded . for further comparison between theory and experiment fractions of 97.6% ground - level and 2.4% metastable xe@xmath0 ions in the parent ion beam",
    "are assumed .",
    "the metastable @xmath147 fraction is divided into 3/7 for the @xmath148 and 4/7 for the @xmath149 contributions assuming level population proportional to the statistical weights .",
    "figure  [ comparison ] compares the present experimental cross sections with the initial - fractions weighted theoretical 249-level darc results except for the overwhelmingly dominant resonance peak . as figure  [ overview2 ] already shows ,",
    "the height of the dominating peak that results from excitation of the xe@xmath137 ) ground state to xe@xmath150 levels with a vacancy in the @xmath26 sub - shell is overestimated by theory .",
    "considering the @xmath6  19% total experimental uncertainty , the theoretical peak cross section is still about 28% above the maximum experimental limit .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that theory finds an additional resonance feature of unknown origin near the position of the @xmath151 resonance peak .",
    "the additional resonance is seen in all darc calculations using the different ( 249- , 508- and 526-level ) models and is slightly shifted in energy in the different calculations .",
    "it interferes in the calculations with the xe@xmath152 resonance .",
    "nevertheless , the line shape and natural width of the xe@xmath152 resonance can be recovered from a two - resonance fit of the unconvoluted theoretical cross - section curve in the energy range of interest assuming two fano profiles .    in reality",
    ", the additional peak may be shifted away in energy from the dominant peak ( there is no evidence for it in the experimental data ) .",
    "the assumption of such a shift reduces the theoretical cross section for photoionization involving the xe@xmath150 levels by about 5.5% bringing it closer to the experiment .",
    "the lorentzian width of the dominant excited @xmath153 term deduced from the theoretical data is 88  mev which compares favorably with the experimental width of ( 76 @xmath6 3 )  mev .",
    "the resonance strength predicted for the @xmath153 term , however , is 279  mb  ev , more than 70% above the experimental result .",
    "it is worth mentioning at this point that the theoretical multi - configuration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) result accompanying the previous study of photoionization by bizau  @xcite is a little more than 10% below the present experimental result ( see figure  [ bizau ] ) .",
    "the simple calculations carried out with the cowan code for finding assignments of resonances underestimates the experimental finding by 80% .",
    "these examples clearly show the difficulty to predict the correct resonance parameters for this three - open - subshells resonance feature .",
    "( colour online ) comparison of the present absolute experimental cross section ( solid red line with dots ) for valence shell photoionization of xe@xmath0 ions in the 95 - 145 ev photon energy range with previous experimental and theoretical work of bizau and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the experimental measurements made at superaco ( solid line with green dots ) were taken at an energy resolution of 750 mev .",
    "the theoretical cross section calculations shown were obtained from the multi - configuration - dirac - fock ( mcdf ) approximation convoluted at 750  mev ( light green shaded area ) , and at 65  mev ( light orange shaded area ) . ]",
    "it should be noted that the cross section axis in figure  [ comparison ] for the theoretical cross sections is different from that of the experimental data indicating differences in absolute height of resonance features .",
    "nevertheless , resonance groups seen in the experiment can be clearly recognized in the theoretical spectrum with reasonable agreement in relative peak heights . theory and experiment",
    "agree in that they both show negligible contributions of direct photoionization of the outermost electron in xe@xmath0 .",
    "the cross section is dominated by inner - shell excitations with subsequent auger or coster - kronig decays .",
    "given the complexity of ag - like xe@xmath0 arising from opening the 4d sub - shell , the present study shows reasonable agreement of theory and experiment over the photon energy region investigated .",
    "figure  [ bizau ] provides a comparison of the present experimental data with experimental and theoretical results of bizau  @xcite .",
    "the inset focuses on the dominant xe@xmath150 resonance feature . for the comparison ,",
    "the relative results of bizau were normalized so as to match the peak area of the dominant @xmath153 resonance . due to the larger width ( @xmath154  mev instead of 65  mev )",
    "the normalized @xmath153-peak cross section is much smaller in height than the present absolute measurement . for a meaningful comparison of the mcdf theory result with the experimental data displayed in figure  [ bizau ] the theory curve displayed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath153 resonance was digitized and the resonance parameters were determined . with the peak area",
    "( 147  mb  ev ) and the resonance energy ( 122.98  ev ) thus obtained plus assuming a lorentzian width of 76  mev as found in the present study , the mcdf resonance was convoluted with gaussians of 65  mev and 750  mev full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , respectively , to be compared with the present and the previous experiments . while very good agreement is found in terms of peak height the experimental and theoretical resonance energies found in ref .",
    "@xcite differ from one another and from the present measurement .",
    "as mentioned above , calculating the correct resonance energies in an ion with three open subshells is difficult .",
    "the present 249-level r - matrix calculation finds the xe@xmath152 resonance at 123.89  ev , the mcdf result is 122.98  ev while the present experiment finds 122.139  ev .",
    "also the experiment by bizau with a resonance energy of 121.36  ev differs from the present result by 0.779  ev . while this difference is of the order of the experimental energy spread of the previous measurement",
    ", the absolute calibration could be substantially better than the resolution .",
    "however , in the letter format of their publication @xcite bizau  did not provide an estimate for the uncertainty of their photon - energy axis .",
    "in contrast to that , the present experiment involved an extremely careful energy calibration with an estimated uncertainty of the xe@xmath152 resonance energy of only 5  mev .",
    "high - resolution absolute cross section measurements for single photoionization of ag - like xe@xmath0 ions forming xe@xmath27 products were obtained at the advanced light source . compared to a previous experiment ,",
    "the cross sections are now on an absolute scale and the energy resolution and statistical precision have been vastly improved .",
    "the experimental results are compared with large - scale close - coupling calculations within the dirac coulomb r - matrix approximation .",
    "calculations using different basis sets and incorporating a progressively larger number of levels ( respectively 249 , 508 and 526 levels ) in the close - coupling calculations , show no significant improvement .",
    "this would indicate that convergence is already obtained with the 249-level calculation .",
    "however , differences still exist between theory and experiment with respect to level energies ( resonance positions ) and resonance strengths .",
    "nevertheless , the main features in the experimental spectrum are reproduced reasonably well by theory .",
    "while the xe@xmath0 parent ion in this study is a quasi - one - electron system with a @xmath19 or a @xmath20 electron outside fully occupied electronic sub - shells , the intermediate excited states ( which then decay by autoionization ) comprise mainly three open sub - shells with relatively high angular momenta and the appropriate coupling of the active electrons renders this problem quite complex . including many more target configurations and levels in the close - coupling calculations makes the theoretical treatment extremely challenging .",
    "given the complexity of the system and the available finite computational resources , the comparison of the present experimental high - resolution photoionization cross sections with the large - scale close - coupling calculations in the present study shows overall agreement .",
