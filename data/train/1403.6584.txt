    "the search for the electric dipole moments ( edms ) of particles ( electrons , muons , neutrons , protons ) as well as the edms of closed many - particle systems ( nuclei , atoms , molecules ) presents one of the most important fundamental physics problems starting from the works of purcell and ramsey @xcite on the neutron edm and of salpeter @xcite on the electron edm in atoms .",
    "the prediction for the electron edm following from the standard model ( sm ) is @xmath1 e cm ( e is the electron charge ) @xcite .",
    "however , within various extensions of the sm @xcite the electron edm can be enhanced to the value close to the bounds obtained in the recent accurate experiments with heavy diatomic molecules ybf @xcite , tho @xcite . a possibility for the observation of the charged particles",
    "edms in heavy diatomic molecules was first discussed in @xcite , where the observation of the proton edm in diatomic molecules with closed electron shells was considered . for the observation of the electron",
    "edm the diatomic molecules with non - closed electron shells should be used . due to the closely lying opposite parity @xmath2-doublets in the heteronuclear diatomic molecules with one heavy nucleus and open electron shells the space parity violating ( p - odd ) @xcite and space parity and time invariance violating ( p , t - odd ) effects , including the edm effect @xcite-@xcite",
    "are strongly enhanced . for the extraction of",
    "a bound for the electron edm from the molecular measurement complicated theoretical calculations are necessary .",
    "such calculations for ybf , pbf , tho and other molecules were performed in @xcite-@xcite .    another idea to observe the muon edm in magnetic storage rings",
    "was suggested in @xcite .",
    "this idea consists of observation of the charged particle spin precession in an electric field due to the existence of the edm .",
    "this idea was realized for muons in frames of the ( g - 2 ) experiment with polarized muons in a magnetic storage ring @xcite and led to a new constraint for the muon edm .",
    "several years ago it was suggested that this constraint can be essentially improved by the full compensation of the magnetic field in the rest frame of the particle by an external electric radial field @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the same idea was discussed for bare nuclei and for highly charged ions ( hci ) with closed electron shells in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "possible proton edm experiments in magnetic storage rings were described in @xcite .",
    "a proposal for the observation of the electron edm in h - like hci in magnetic storage rings was made in @xcite .",
    "very recently it was suggested to use electrostatic storage rings for the observation of the charged particles ( muon , proton , deuteron ) edms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this idea to the observation of the electron edm in the h - like ions .",
    "the operating electrostatic storage rings , which however were never used for the search for edms , exist in aarhus ( denmark ) @xcite , stockholm ( sweden ) @xcite and heidelberg ( germany ) @xcite .",
    "very recently it was also suggested to employ an electrostatic storage ring to observe the electron edm in molecular ions and the possibility to reach the boundary @xmath3 e cm was anticipated @xcite . in @xcite",
    "an ion @xmath4 was chosen for the theoretical studies .",
    "the proposed experiment in @xcite was very similar to the experimental techniques employed in @xcite,@xcite with molecular beams but could provide better statistics .",
    "this experimental techniques differ essentially from the simple magnetic resonance @xcite and the muon spin precession effect in the external electric field as in @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that the electron spins are polarized by laser pumping to some excited state , then the electron spin rotates due to the edm in the external electric field and this rotation is fixed in the decay process of the excited state .",
    "this scheme is quite similar to one suggested for the electron edm observation in the h - like ions in magnetic storage rings in @xcite .",
    "the electron edm search with the h - like ions has important advantages compared to the electron edm experiments with heavy molecules .",
    "first , the experiments with h - like ions require much simpler theoretical support",
    ". this will become quite important for the extraction of accurate values for the edm from the experimental results after the experimental discovery of the electron edm .",
    "moreover , we will demonstrate that the experiments with h - like ions may provide a possibility to distinguish the electron edm effect and the effect of p , t - odd interaction between the atomic electron and the nucleus .",
    "these two effects can not be distinguished in experiments with heavy neutral atoms and molecules .",
    "an electrostatic storage ring as described in @xcite - @xcite presents a ring with two deflection areas formed by pairs of plates ( electrodes ) as it is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the electric field is sustained between these plates and has a radial direction .",
    "this electric field compensate the centrifugal force and the injected charged particles move along a closed trajectory in the ring .",
    "the radius of the ring r grows up with the mass and velocity of an ion but drops down with the larger ion charge . assuming the applied electric field of the order @xmath5 v / cm and the velocity of the particles of about @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the speed of light ) we obtain for the different ions the radii given in table i. this table demonstrates that compared to the existing magnetic storage rings the electrostatic rings have the size smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "for the observation of the edm effect in storage rings polarized particles are necessary @xcite - @xcite .",
    "production , preservation and monitoring of polarized h - like hci beams in magnetic storage rings are discussed theoretically in @xcite . as a production method",
    "a selective laser pumping of the excited hyperfine sublevel of a ground electronic level of an ion was suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where the @xmath8 ion was considered as an example",
    ". the selective laser pumping method of polarization consists of the excitation of a hyperfine sublevel of h - like hci with a circularly polarized optical laser .",
    "this excitation leads to an inhomogeneous occupation of the zeeman substates of the excited hyperfine state , i.e. the excited hyperfine level becomes polarized .",
    "this happens during one laser pulse ( @xmath9 s ) , i.e. after one revolution of the ion around the ring ( @xmath10 s ) .",
    "the laser beam is assumed to travel parallel to the ion beam in a certain ring area .",
    "then the quantization axis is called longitudinal and the laser produces a longitudinal polarization . in @xcite , @xcite resonant laser excitation measurements of the hyperfine structure of h - like @xmath11pb and @xmath12bi ions were performed .",
    "it follows from the results of these measurements that during one pulse an equilibrium between the excited and the ground hyperfine levels is established .",
    "after the ions leave the polarization area 50@xmath13 of them will be in an excited ( polarized ) hyperfine state and 50@xmath13 will be in the ground ( unpolarized ) hyperfine state of the ground electronic state .",
    "after the excited hyperfine state decays ( see table ii for the decay time ) the laser should be switched on again .",
    "a question arises , whether the ions will not lose their polarization in the process of decay ?",
    "in @xcite it was proved that the ions will not lose the polarization in the particular case of transitions between the hyperfine levels @xmath14 when @xmath15 .",
    "this case corresponds to all the transitions in table ii . in a more general way",
    "this problem is discussed in appendix a. calculations of the polarization dynamics show that initially unpolarized ions will acquire the 100@xmath13 polarization after some time period @xmath16 ( see table ii ) .",
    "we define the degree of polarization @xmath17 as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the quantum numbers for the total angular momentum and its projection for an ion and @xmath21 are the occupation numbers for the zeeman substates",
    ". it is assumed that @xmath22 from table ii one can see that the selective laser pumping method should work only for relatively heavy h - like ions with @xmath23 , otherwise the 100@xmath13 polarization time becomes too long and the necessary laser frequency is lying out of the optical region .",
    "the preservation of the ion polarization during the many revolutions of the ion around the ring is a hard problem due to the existence of the depolarization effects .",
    "methods for the ion polarization preservation in the magnetic storage rings were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the corresponding methods for the electrostatic ring are essentially the same as for the preservation of the edm effect and will be discussed below in section vi .",
    "creation of a longitudinally polarized h - like hci beam in an electrostatic storage ring presents the first step of the proposed experiment ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the main aim of the edm experiment is the generation of a vertical component of the polarization due to the existence of the electron edm .",
    "this is a second step of the experiment . for simplicity",
    "we start with the consideration of hci with spinless nuclei . then the h - like hci will be treated as a particle with the mass @xmath24 , charge @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the atomic number , @xmath27 is the nucleon mass",
    ", @xmath28 is the nuclear charge number ) and the magnetic moment equal to the magnetic moment of an electron @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the electron charge , @xmath31 is the electron spin , @xmath32 is the planck constant , @xmath33 is the bohr magneton and @xmath34 is the electron mass .",
    "if the particle possesses an edm @xmath35 which is directed along the particle spin , it undergoes a precession in an external electric field .",
    "this is the basic idea of all the edm experiments in storage rings , magnetic or electrostatic .",
    "the edm @xmath35 and the spin of the particle @xmath31 are connected via @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a dimensionless constant which has to be determined in the experiment . in the rest frame of the ion @xmath38",
    "\\equiv \\vec{s } \\times \\vec{\\omega}_d , \\ ] ] where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the external electric and magnetic fields in the laboratory frame , @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the particle velocity , @xmath43 .",
    "spin precession occurs around the direction of the vector @xmath44 , defined in eq.(4 ) . in the nonrelativistic case @xmath44",
    "coincides with @xmath39 .",
    "electron spin precession due to the electron magnetic moment is described by an equation ( in the rest frame of an ion ) @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the motional magnetic field @xmath47 this is actually the bargmann - michel - telegdi ( bmt ) equation @xcite , where the terms responsible for the thomas precession are neglected .",
    "these terms depend on the particle acceleration and in case of h - like hci are inversely proportional to the ion mass , i.e. negligible @xcite",
    ".    equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) can be generalized to any h - like hci with a nucleus possessing the nuclear spin @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "then we have to replace in eq.(3 ) the vector @xmath31 by the vector @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the total angular momentum of the electron .",
    "precession of the longitudinally polarized electron spin @xmath31 around the direction of the radial electric field due to the electron edm leads to the generation of a vertical spin component ( assuming that the ring is horizontal , @xmath51 is radial direction , @xmath52 is longitudinal direction and @xmath53 is vertical direction ) . due to the edm",
    "the ion polarization vector will rotate by a small angle @xmath54 around the @xmath51 axis .",
    "this rotation will continue for every revolution of the ions around the ring and the rotation angle @xmath54 will grow up linearly with time ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the relation of the edm of a neutral system ( atom , molecule ) to the edms of the charged particles ( nuclei , electrons ) incorporated in this system is regulated by the schiff theorem @xcite . according to this theorem , the total electric field at the charged particle inside the neutral system is zero due to the electrostatic equilibrium , so that the edm effect is absent .",
    "however , the schiff theorem is violated either by strong interactions which determine the finite size of the nucleus , or by the magnetic interactions , i.e. relativistic corrections . as a result the nuclear edm in atoms and molecules",
    "is suppressed compared to the bare nuclei , but the electron edm in heavy atoms and molecules is , in contrary , enhanced due to the strong relativistic effects @xcite,@xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we perform similar estimates for the hci .",
    "the `` primary '' edm of an atom or ion due to the electron edm is @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the dirac matrices and the average @xmath57 corresponds to the electronic state under consideration .",
    "the relativistic correction to the stark matrix element @xmath58 where @xmath39 is an external electric field can be presented as @xcite , @xcite @xmath59 and estimated as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the dirac matrix and @xmath62 is the fine structure constant . due to the factor @xmath63",
    "only the lower component of the dirac wave function contributes , i.e. the result is fully determined by relativistic effects .",
    "the electric dipole moment of an atom and accordingly the linear stark matrix element @xmath64 are zero in the absence of the electron edm . however ,",
    "if the electron edm is present , @xmath65 becomes nonzero due to mixing of the states with opposite parity by the interaction ( in r.u . )",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 is the coulomb field of the nucleus , @xmath68 is radius - vector , @xmath69 and @xmath70 is defined in eq.([7 ] ) . due to the interaction eq.([12 ] ) the atomic linear stark effect becomes ( we retain only relativistic corrections which give nonzero contribution to the edm effect ) : @xmath71 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 , @xmath73 are the wave functions and energies of the atomic dirac states with the parity opposite to the state @xmath74 . in what follows",
    "we choose the state @xmath74 as the ground state @xmath75 of the h - like ion .",
    "the sum over @xmath76 ( only @xmath77 states are contributing ) was evaluated exactly including the discrete and continuous dirac spectra within the b - spline approach @xcite,@xcite . for practical evaluations we consider the nucleus as a homogeneously charged sphere .",
    "the nuclear radii are taken from @xcite . using the order - of - magnitude estimates ( in r.u . ) : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , we obtain from eq.([13 ] ) @xmath81 i.e. a correction of the same order as eq.([10 ] ) .",
    "due to the schiff theorem the nonrelativistic contributions to the total stark shift eq.([8 ] ) and eq.([11 ] ) cancel out : @xmath82 still the relativistic corrections eq.([9 ] ) and eq.([13 ] ) remain .",
    "the coefficient @xmath83 for the effective electron edm in an atom or ion can be defined as @xmath84 it follows that for the case @xmath85 , @xmath86 , the coefficient @xmath87 , so there is no enhancement . for another choice @xmath88 ,",
    "@xmath86 using the estimate for the lamb shift @xmath89 , we would have a strong enhancement , @xmath90 .",
    "however , the edm experiment with the excited @xmath91 state of the hci as the basic one seems to be unrealistic , since the lifetime of the level @xmath91 in ions with high @xmath28 value is quite short and is not enough to perform the edm experiment ( see section v ) .",
    "the repeated excitation of the ions to the @xmath91 state should lead to the loss of polarization , i.e. also makes the edm experiment impossible .",
    "the coefficients @xmath83 for different ions are given in table iii .",
    "there is an important advantage of the edm experiment with different h - like hci in storage rings compared to the linear stark edm measurements performed with certain neutral atoms and molecules .",
    "collecting and comparing the results of the edm experiments for the h - like ions with different @xmath28 values one can distinguish the electron edm effect from the effect caused by p- and t - violating interaction @xmath92 of the electron with the nucleus .",
    "this is not possible in experiments with neutral atoms or molecules .",
    "the identity of consequences of both effects was demonstrated in @xcite for any particular atom or ion .",
    "however , the different dependence of these effects on @xmath28 gives an opportunity to distinguish them provided that there is sufficient experimental data for the ions with different @xmath28 values .",
    "the scalar p , t - violating interaction @xmath92 looks like @xcite,@xcite,@xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 are dirac matrices , @xmath95 is the constant of interaction and @xmath96 is the `` p , t - odd charge '' of the nucleus . in the nonrelativistic limit operator",
    "@xmath92 takes the form ( in r.u . )",
    "@xmath97,\\ ] ] where @xmath98 are the pauli matrices , @xmath99 is the momentum operator and @xmath100 $ ] denotes the commutator .",
    "the stark shift caused by the interaction eq.([18 ] ) reads @xmath101 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this expression we derived in the same way as eq.([13 ] ) .",
    "the estimate for the electron momentum in an ion is @xmath102 . for practical purposes we replace @xmath103 in eqs.([18]),([19 ] ) by the nuclear density distribution @xmath104 .",
    "the expectation value @xmath105 can be estimated as @xcite @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the schrdinger wave function at the surface of the nucleus and @xmath108 is the relativistic enhancement factor .",
    "then we obtain @xmath109 here @xmath110 @xcite , @xmath111 is the nuclear radius and @xmath112 is the bohr radius .    similar to eq.([17 ] ) we can define the coefficient @xmath113 as @xmath114 coefficients @xmath115 for different h - like ions are also given in table iii .    for comparing the @xmath28-dependence of the edm effect and p , t - odd interaction effect we present the edm effect in the form @xmath116 where @xmath117 can be understood as the linear stark shift or rotation angle in the external electric field @xmath39",
    ", @xmath118 is a numerical factor and @xmath83 is a @xmath28-dependent expression that can be exactly evaluated with dirac wave functions .",
    "a similar expression for the p , t - odd interaction reads @xmath119 then we can consider the ratios @xmath120 @xmath121 for example , taking the simplest assumption @xmath122 ( @xmath123 , n is the number of neutrons , a is the atomic number ) and comparing the @xmath108 values for @xmath124 and @xmath125 we have @xmath126 @xmath127 so the difference can be rather essential .",
    "the influence of the radiative corrections on the ratios ( [ 27]),([28 ] ) should be negligible . comparing the experimental @xmath108 value with the theoretical @xmath128 and @xmath129 values it should be possible , in principle , to distinguish between the electron edm effect and the p , t - odd interaction effect .",
    "in this paper we suggest the following scenario for the observation of the electron edm .",
    "we suppose that the ions move in the ring within a time interval which is sufficient for the edm rotation angle to grow up essentially .",
    "the angle @xmath130 after the observation time @xmath131 becomes @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the frequency of the precession of the ion polarization around the vector @xmath44 ( see eq.(4 ) ) .",
    "this frequency can be estimated as @xcite @xmath134 denotes the part of the ring where the ions move in the electric field .",
    "it is reasonable to assume @xmath135 . for an electric field of about @xmath136",
    "v / cm from eq.([29 ] ) follows @xmath137 . for the observation of the electron edm at the level @xmath0 e",
    "cm we should use the value @xmath138 in our estimates .",
    "then we can estimate @xmath131 necessary to make the rotation angle of the order of @xmath139 which seems to be a measurable value : @xmath140 the results obtained with formula ( [ 30 ] ) are listed in table iii .",
    "after the edm rotation angle has grown up sufficiently the third step of the experiment - the measurement of the effect should start .",
    "polarization laser should be switched on again .",
    "for the ions with @xmath141 the time @xmath131 necessary for the observation of edm is larger than the 100% polarization time @xmath16 and consequently much larger then the decay time @xmath142 .",
    "then , at the start of the third step of the experiment all ions will be in their ground state . for the observation of the edm effect it will be necessary to excite the ions back to the excited hyperfine sublevel .",
    "it can be done again with the same circularly polarized optical laser and this excitation will not destroy the existing polarization .",
    "as we have already mentioned the decay of the excited hyperfine level with the total angular momentum value @xmath19 to the ground hyperfine level @xmath143 will not destroy the ion polarization if @xmath144 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it remains to prove that the excitation process @xmath145 also will not destroy the ion polarization .",
    "consider for example the case @xmath146 , @xmath147 .",
    "then for 100% ion polarization only zeeman substate with @xmath148 will be occupied .",
    "a circularly polarized laser will be able to populate only @xmath149 zeeman substate of the excited hyperfine level , i.e. 100% polarization will be preserved .",
    "we suggest to apply the same idea as for the hci in a magnetic storage ring in @xcite : it will be necessary to measure the asymmetry in the number of the decay photons with fixed circular polarization with respect to the vertical polarization component of the ions .",
    "an expression for the transition probability of the decay process when the circular polarization of the emitted photons is fixed , looks like @xcite @xmath150,\\ ] ] where @xmath151 is the total transition rate , @xmath152 is the unit vector of the ion beam polarization , @xmath153 is the unit vector of the direction of the photon emission , @xmath154 correspond to the right ( left ) circular polarization of the emitted photons , @xmath155 defines the magnitude of the edm effect and @xmath156 is a factor of order @xmath157 , specific for the particular transition in an ion .",
    "the value of @xmath155 can be presented as @xmath158 where @xmath19 is the total angular momentum of the excited hyperfine sublevel of the ground electronic level of an ion , @xmath17 is the degree of the ion polarization and @xmath130 is the edm rotation angle in the xz plane",
    ". it should be convenient to locate the photon detectors above and below the ring and to measure the asymmetry in the number of photons detected in the upper and lower hemispheres .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath108 equals to @xmath159 knowing @xmath108 from the experimental data and using eqs.([32 ] ) , ( [ 33 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) one can define the @xmath37 ( i.e. the electron edm ) value . in particular with @xmath160 @xcite , @xmath161 ( see above ) , @xmath162 ( since the time of observation is much greater than the polarization time , most of their time ions will move in the ring being fully polarized ) and @xmath19 values from the table ii , the @xmath108 values should be of the order @xmath163 . for the observation of the effect of the order @xmath164 over the level of fluctuations it is necessary to fix at least @xmath165 `` events ''",
    ", i.e. hci decays from the excited hyperfine @xmath166 level .",
    "for example , for @xmath167 the decay time @xmath168s .",
    "since this time is much smaller than the observation time @xmath169 hours for @xmath167 ions , the necessary statistics for the fixation of the edm effect in the electrostatic ring with @xmath170 ions in the beam can be obtained within 1 second even with the detector efficiency @xmath164 . for the registration of smaller asymmetry @xmath171 the observation time @xmath131 for @xmath167 ions will go down to @xmath157 hour .",
    "the registration time @xmath172 then will grow up to @xmath173 s , i.e. will be approximately the same as @xmath131 .",
    "the main advantage of the electrostatic ring compared to the magnetic one in the context of the electron edm experiments with h - like hci is the reduction of the background effects .",
    "first , in the magnetic storage ring the strong vertical bending magnets produce a fast electron spin rotation in the horizontal plane .",
    "this leads to an averaging of the edm effect to zero .",
    "second , the focussing magnets which create a magnetic field with radial component produce a false edm effect . to overcome both difficulties a complicated experimental scheme containing `` siberian snakes '' was proposed in @xcite .",
    "however in the rest frame of the ions a motional magnetic field arises in the electric field regions of the electrostatic ring . for the radial electric field",
    "the motional field will have a vertical component ( see eq.([6 ] ) ) , i.e. will cause the same problems as the bending magnets in the magnetic rings . in the electric field",
    "@xmath174 v / cm and for the ion velocity 0.1 c the motional field will be about @xmath175 t ( 30 gs ) , i.e. essentially weaker than the magnetic fields of bending magnets in the magnetic storage rings ( 1 t ) .",
    "while passing the deflection area about few meters length with velocity 0.1 c the electron spin in h - like ion will rotate about @xmath176 times in the horizontal ( @xmath177 ) plane , i.e. the rotation angle will be about @xmath178 . for the purpose of the edm experiment we have to keep the ion polarization longitudinal , i.e. the deviation from the direction along the @xmath52 axis should not exceed @xmath179 .",
    "we assume that the vertical component of the motional magnetic field @xmath180 can be compensated by real vertical magnetic field , i.e. to each pair of electrodes a vertical magnet can be attached that will compensate the influence of the motional field on the ion polarization .",
    "the insertion of such magnets in the electrostatic ring will partly diminish the strength of the electric field acting on the moving ions , but this effect can be taken into account by the construction of the ring .    as it follows from eq.(6 )",
    "the motional field @xmath46 has two components : vertical @xmath181 , presented by the first term in the right - hand side of eq.(6 ) , and longitudinal @xmath182 , presented by the second term . since the compensating magnetic field is orthogonal to the ion velocity , the second term in the right - hand side of eq.(6 )",
    "will be effectively suppressed .",
    "this term contains also a small parameter @xmath183 .    to keep the ion polarization longitudinal after one revolution of the ions around the ring",
    ", the compensating magnetic field @xmath184 should be fixed with an accuracy defined by the condition @xmath185 for @xmath186 gs this gives @xmath187 gs which should be realistic .",
    "possible systematic effects which grow up linearly with the number of revolutions could be suppressed by changing the direction of the ion velocity and simultaneous changing the ion polarization from longitudinal to anti - longitudinal one as is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the direction of the compensating magnetic field also should be reversed .",
    "if to perform such a change after every revolution the background effect from the vertical component of @xmath46 will be fully canceled but the edm effect will survive : the vector @xmath42 changes the sign , but @xmath31 remains the same in eqs.([4])-([6 ] ) .",
    "this would require a more complicated construction of the ring with switches that will change periodically the route of the bunched ion beam around the ring .",
    "the switches can be arranged by turning off few electrodes or turning on few additional ones .",
    "this will change the curvature of the trajectory of ions and hence change the route .",
    "the direction of polarization can be changed from longitudinal to anti - longitudinal and back with the spin rotator  a vertical magnet which rotates the electron spin in the horizontal plane by an angle @xmath188 .",
    "if the spin rotators will be located outside the electrodes this operation will not do any harm to the edm rotation angle .",
    "the use of the cross - routes should strongly suppress the systematic background effects .",
    "the cancellation of the residual magnetic field ( which remains after the compensation of the motional field by a real one ) after two subsequent revolutions can be incomplete only due to the change of the velocity of the ion from one revolution to another . but this change @xmath189 is due to the fluctuations , i.e. grows up not linearly with the number of revolutions @xmath190 , but is proportional to @xmath191 . assuming that the field control in the ring can be as high as @xmath192",
    "we can expect that after the compensation of the motional magnetic field by the real one the residual magnetic field will be of the order @xmath193 gs .",
    "then after the cancellation of this residual field due to the cross - route scheme of the experiment the systematic background rotation angle will be of the order @xmath194 per one revolution ( the magnetic field of the 1 gs rotates the electron spin by an angle @xmath188 at the length interval of about few meters ) .",
    "assuming that the velocity control is also of the order @xmath195 we obtain a systematic `` parasite '' magnetic rotation @xmath196 per one revolution .",
    "then with the @xmath197s ( @xmath167 ) , i.e. for @xmath198 revolutions of the ions around the ring the total systematic background rotation angle will raise up to @xmath199 .",
    "this is acceptable since the vertical background magnetic field will not average out the edm effect .",
    "the feasibility of the proposed experiment depends mainly on the suppression of systematic errors which might be a difficult task . still due to the relatively small size of the electrostatic ring it is possible to locate it into the cooler and into the vacuum chamber and to achieve full magnetic shielding .",
    "this could help to reach the required overall accuracy of about @xmath192 for the field and ion velocity control .",
    "a possible disadvantage of the electrostatic storage rings compared to the magnetic ones is the smaller ion current : maximum @xmath170 stored ions in the ring elisa @xcite compared to @xmath200 ions in esr ( gsi , darmstadt ) .",
    "however , the number of ions ( which determines the statistics of the experiment ) is not so important for the proposed edm experiment , since after the edm rotation angle will reach its final value @xmath201 , the measurement of the photon emission asymmetry of the order @xmath164 should not represent a serious difficulty . the smallness of the edm effect in this experiment is reflected by the relatively large observation time @xmath131 necessary to reach the rotation angle @xmath201 .",
    "another disadvantage of the electrostatic rings compared to the magnetic storage rings is the problem of the focusing . due to the gravity",
    "the ions in the electrostatic ring will drop down essentially within few seconds . in @xmath202",
    "s the ion beam with @xmath203 will be shifted down by @xmath157 mm . to keep the beam at a certain height",
    "it would be necessary to switch on a `` supporting '' vertical electric field outside the deflection areas after some time period , for example after every @xmath202 s , i.e. after @xmath204 revolutions of the ions around the ring .",
    "this supporting field can be rather weak : for the length of the non - deflecting area of about 1 m this field should be about 0.1 v / cm .",
    "one more difficulty with the electrostatic rings is the relatively short lifetime of the beam in these rings .",
    "if in magnetic ring esr the beam can exist for at least 10 hours , the lifetime of the beam in electrostatic ring is much shorter : 30 minutes in the ring desiree in stockholm @xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for this short lifetime is the loss of energy due to the radiation of the charged particle moving along the bended trajectory , i.e. electric bremsstrahlung in our case .",
    "this problem can be solved by the segments with longitudinal ( accelerating ) electric field in the ring .",
    "the longitudinal electric field should not produce any dangerous motional magnetic field provided that the field and velocity control conditions at the level @xmath192 are satisfied .",

    "for this purpose we rewrite the clebsch - gordan coefficients in terms of 3j - symbols and use the formula for summation over one angular momentum projection for two 3j - symbols @xcite @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223 where @xmath224 , @xmath225 and a standard notation for 6j - symbol is employed .",

    "what concerns the second term with the factor @xmath228 let s consider 3j - symbol with different @xmath51 parameter .",
    "here it is convenient to return to clebsch - gordan coefficients . for @xmath231 the clebsch - gordan coefficient does nt depend on the projection @xmath228 : @xmath232 for @xmath233 the dependence is quadratic in @xmath228 : @xmath234^{1/2}}\\ ] ] and only @xmath235 gives the linear dependence on @xmath228 : @xmath236 due to the consequent multiplication by @xmath228 and summation over @xmath228 only the linear term survives .",
    "this term ( @xmath235 ) gives linear dependence on @xmath20 , so after collecting both terms ( with factors @xmath20 and @xmath228 ) the degree of polarization of the final state can be presented in the following form : @xmath237 where @xmath238 and @xmath239 is the degree of polarization of the initial state . in particular , choosing the momentum of the final state @xmath240 we have @xmath241 , which means the conservation of the degree of polarization .",
