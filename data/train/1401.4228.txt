    "one of the central issues in the study of condensed matter physics in recent years is to verify the existence of majorana fermions in various condensed matter systems .",
    "this tide of research has been partly triggered by the suggestion that the majorana modes have great potential in the applications of fault - tolerant quantum computations.@xcite theoretically , it was found that the majorana edge states are supported by certain quantum hall states as well as the @xmath0-wave superconductors and superfluids.@xcite more recently , fu and kane@xcite proposed that majorana fermions can be created in the vortices of @xmath1-wave superconductors deposited on the surface of a three - dimensional topological insulator.@xcite in particular , chiral majorana fermion edge states can be created at the interface between a superconductor and the area gapped by ferromagnetic materials.@xcite motivated by these theoretical proposals , the transport properties between the majorana edge states and the ( noninteracting ) normal metallic lead were studied in a pioneering work,@xcite and it was found that the majorana fermions induce resonant andreev reflection from the lead to the grounded superconductor .",
    "the resulting linear tunneling conductance is @xmath2 or @xmath3 , depending on whether there is an even or odd number of vortices in the superconductor .",
    "another interesting proposal for the realization of majorana modes was made in two seminal works in refs .",
    "and , motivated by a model proposed by kitaev.@xcite it was found that the localized majorana modes can exist at the end of a spin - orbit coupled nanowire subjected to a magnetic field and proximate to an @xmath1-wave superconductor . following these proposals , experimental evidence for such a majorana edge mode",
    "was obtained in indium antimonide quantum wires.@xcite these developments initiated further theoretical studies on the electrical transport properties of this system.@xcite in particular , the effects of the electron - electron interactions in the metallic leads have been analyzed from a new perspective based on the renormalization - group ( rg ) method.@xcite the main conclusion is that among all possible local interactions in the tunneling junction , the tunneling via the majorana edge mode is the most relevant , and it drives the system all the way from the perfect normal reflection fixed point to the perfect andreev reflection fixed point . the latter controls the low - temperature electrical transport properties , characterized by a universal zero - bias conductance at zero temperature ( @xmath3 for a single lead with spinless fermions ) .    in the present work",
    ", we study a quantum point contact ( qpc ) between a ( chiral ) majorana liquid at the edge of a topological superconductor ( tsc ) and a helical ( spinless ) luttinger liquid ( hll),@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "our work intervenes between refs . and in the sense that we investigate the interplay between the electron - electron interaction effect in the metallic lead and the role of the propagating majorana mode , instead of a localized mode .",
    "the main results of our work are summarized in fig .",
    "our analysis focuses on the intermediate temperature range below the superconducting gap such that the finite - size effects of both the hll and the majorana liquid can be ignored . under this condition",
    ", our rg analysis in the weak - tunneling limit shows that , unlike the case with a localized majorana end mode , the tunneling between the majorana liquid and the hll is inhibited at low energy and the system is driven to a new fixed point ( referred to as the fixed point @xmath4 in the main text ) in which the hll is effectively cut into two separated pieces by a local backscattering potential at the qpc .",
    "( this local backscattering potential is produced by the proximity to the tsc , and is allowed because the time - reversal symmetry is broken by the @xmath0-wave tsc . )",
    "moreover , we also performed a scaling analysis regarding the stability of the perfect andreev reflection fixed point ( referred to as the fixed point @xmath5 ) in the strong - tunneling limit and found that it is unstable toward the weak - tunneling regime .",
    "thus , the possibility of the existence of a nontrivial quantum critical point in the intermediate - tunneling - strength regime , which separates fixed point @xmath4 from fixed point @xmath5 , is unlikely .",
    "because the low - temperature and high - temperature physics of this system are controlled by different fixed points , we obtain a two - stage scaling of the tunneling conductance with temperature , dictated by different exponents as shown in fig .",
    "[ mlg1 ] . since in real systems ,",
    "the majorana liquid is most likely to be of the mesoscopic length scale,@xcite we expect that at temperatures below the scale @xmath6 set by the level spacing of the majorana modes , the majorana liquid will behave like a localized mode and the system will eventually experience a crossover to the model studied in ref .",
    ", i.e. two metallic leads coupled to a single majorana mode .",
    "therefore , the tunneling via the majorana mode will become a relevant perturbation , and the tunneling conductance of the system at zero temperature will saturate at a universal value depending on the ll parameter , as long as there is a majorana edge state whose energy matches the fermi level of the lead.@xcite    .",
    "electrons can tunnel between the hll and the tsc through the point contact .",
    "the superconductor is grounded .",
    "the chemical potentials at the two leads are chosen to be identical , i.e. , @xmath7 . ]    in the remaining sections , we present systematical theoretical analysis which supports the above conclusions and compare our results with previous works in the final section .",

    "it implies the single - electron tunneling through the qpc at low bias .",

    "to sum up , we study a qpc between the chiral majorana edge states of a tsc and the hll .",
    "our rg analysis predicts a nonmonotonic behavior of the zero - bias tunneling conductance with temperature and the power - law temperature dependence in the intermediate temperature range . since tunneling into the usual nontopological superconductors ( or insulators )",
    "will make the tunneling conductance decrease exponentially with decreasing temperature due to the bulk gap in the energy spectrum , the behavior of the tunneling conductance with temperature we found is an indication of the existence of gapless states at the edge of the tsc .",
    "moreover , we evaluate perturbatively the fcs of the tunneling current at zero temperature , and use the corresponding result to extract the tunneling current and its noise power at zero frequency .",
    "previous studies on a distinct tsc - hll tunneling junction shows that the low - temperature transport properties are controlled by a perfect andreev reflection fixed point@xcite , while in our case , it is the fixed point @xmath4 which controls the low - energy physics .",
    "experimentally , the distinction between these two fixed points can also be revealed by the corresponding fano factors , which reflect the nature of the transported charges .",
    "specifically , the fano factor obtained in our case is @xmath173 rather than @xmath172 , as expected for a tunneling process dominated by andreev reflections.@xcite the origin of this difference is twofold : first of all , the scaling dimension of the tunneling via the majorana edge states is increased in our case by the propagating nature of majorana fermions .",
    "next , the metallic lead in the system studied in refs . and is essentially a half wire .",
    "therefore , upon folding , the local potential scattering in the tunneling junction contains only the forward scattering of electrons , whose sole effect is to change the phase of the incident electron and does not affect the low - energy physics of the system qualitatively . on the other hand , the potential scattering term in our system also contains the backscattering of electrons , which effectively cuts the wire into two semi - infinite pieces at low energies.@xcite we would like to stress that such a term must be included not only because the time - reversal symmetry is broken by the @xmath0-wave tsc , but also because it will inevitably be generated at the energy scale below the sc gap through the virtual tunneling between the electrons in the hll and the gapped quasiparticles in the tsc .",
    "another similar tunneling junction between two metallic leads and the end of a tsc wire via the localized majorana mode was analyzed in ref . .",
    "in that case , a local backscattering can also be generated by renormalization .",
    "however , the tunneling via the majorana end mode is still the most relevant perturbation , which leads to different low - energy physics from those presented here .",
    "our analysis in the present work can be extended readily to study the electron - electron interaction effect on the system considered in ref .",
    ", which is a tunneling junction between a chiral majorana liquid of finite size and the metallic lead .",
    "according to the scaling analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ wtr ] , it is easy to see that the zero - bias tunneling conductance in that system will also exhibit a nonmonotonic behavior with decreasing temperature .",
    "as the temperature is lowered , the zero - bias conductance will decrease toward zero in the form of @xmath174 , as shown by the second stage behavior presented in fig .",
    "when @xmath175 , the tunneling conductance will increase as the temperature decreases further and will eventually be saturated at the value of @xmath3 , as long as there is a zero - energy majorana mode in the tsc , as predicted in ref . .",
    "this nonmonotonic scaling behavior of the tunneling conductance with temperature is in sharp contrast to that for tunneling into a single majorana end mode.@xcite in the latter case , the tunneling conductance is expected to rise immediately as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the subtle difference between these two cases should serve as a guide in future experiments in identifying the possible majorana edge states of tsc .",
    "moreover , a complete analysis regarding the interplay between the effects of finite bias ( temperature ) and the finite size of the majorana liquid is a topic for future study .",

    "<S> the induced backscattering in the helical luttinger liquid is the most relevant for repulsive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , at low temperatures , the helical luttinger liquid is effectively cut into two separated half wires . as a result , the low - temperature physics is described by a fixed point consisting of two leads coupled to the topological superconductor , and the electrical transport properties through the point contact at low temperature and low bias are dominated by the tunneling via the majorana edge channel . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the temperature dependence of the zero - bias tunneling conductance and study the full counting statistics for the tunneling current at zero temperature . </S>"
