    "the ads / qcd model has been extensively used in describing a wide variety of phenomena in particle and nuclear physics and even in condensed matter physics .",
    "the model  @xcite is constructed as a 5d holographic dual of qcd based on the general wisdom of ads / cft  @xcite , the 5d gauge coupling being identified by matching the two - point vector correlation functions in deep euclidean region .",
    "although the ads / qcd model is based on an _ ad hoc _ ground , it reflects some of most important features of gauge / gravity duality .",
    "moreover , it is rather successful in describing properties of mesons  ( see , for example , the following recent review  @xcite ) .",
    "qcd is not a conformal theory , in particular , in the low - energy region , so one should also incorporate this property in constructing an effective ads / qcd model .",
    "consequently , different models have been developed . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the size of the extra dimension ( also known as the compactification scale ) was fixed at the point that corresponds approximately to the qcd scale parameter @xmath0 , i.e. , an infrared ( ir ) cutoff parameter was explicitly introduced .",
    "it is often considered as the confinement scale that also breaks sharply the conformal invariance .",
    "these ads / qcd models are called the _ hard - wall model_. on the contrary , there is an alternative approach called a _ soft - wall model _ in which the conformal invariance is broken smoothly by introducing the dilaton - like field in the 5d ads space  @xcite .",
    "while both approaches describe meson properties relatively well , one confronts a serious problem in the baryonic sector . since there is no theoretical reason that the confinement scale for the baryon should be the same as that for the meson , different values of the ir cutoff for the baryon",
    "have been introduced  @xcite .",
    "actually , the main reason for that is due to the fact that it is impossible to reproduce the meson and baryon properties , in particular , excited nucleon states  @xcite , with the same value of the ir cutoff used .",
    "however , when one calculates the meson - nucleon coupling constants , a serious inconsistency arises  @xcite . in order to determine the coupling constants consistently",
    ", one must use the _ same _ ir cutoff .",
    "otherwise , one can not fully consider whole information on the meson and nucleon wavefunctions .",
    "this is the motivation of the present investigation and has been studied in our recent work  @xcite . in the present talk , we will briefly review how to resolve this inconsistency and will put forward possible methods to describe the meson and baryon on an equal footing .",
    "we start from a hard - wall model for mesons developed in refs.@xcite and study its applications to nucleons@xcite .",
    "the model has a geometry of 5d ads @xmath1 where @xmath2 stands for the 4d minkowski metric : @xmath3 .",
    "the 5d ads space is compactified by two different boundary conditions , i.e. the ir boundary at @xmath4 and the uv one at @xmath5 . considering the global chiral symmetry @xmath6 of qcd",
    ", we need to introduce 5d local gauge fields @xmath7 and @xmath8 of which the values at @xmath9 play a role of external sources for @xmath10 and @xmath11 currents respectively .",
    "since chiral symmetry is known to be broken to @xmath12 spontaneously as well as explicitly , we introduce a bi - fundamental field @xmath13 with respect to the local gauge symmetry @xmath6 , in order to realize the spontaneous and explicit breakings of chiral symmetry in the ads side . considering these two",
    ", we can construct the bi - fundamental 5d bulk scalar field @xmath13 in terms of the current quark mass @xmath14 and the quark condensate @xmath15 @xmath16 with isospin symmetry assumed .",
    "the 5d gauge action in ads space with the scalar bulk field and the vector field can be expressed as @xmath17 , \\label{eq : eff_meson}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where covariant derivative and field strength tensors are defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "the 5d gauge coupling @xmath20 is fixed by matching the 5d vector correlation function to that from the operator product expansion ( ope ) : @xmath21 .",
    "the 5d mass of the bulk gauge field @xmath22 is determined by the relation @xmath23@xcite where @xmath24 denotes the canonical dimension of the corresponding operator with spin @xmath25 and turns out to be @xmath26 because of gauge symmetry .",
    "the effective action  ( [ eq : eff_meson ] ) describes the mesonic sector@xcite completely apart from exotic mesons@xcite .    to consider baryons in the flavor - two ( @xmath27 ) sector",
    ", one needs to introduce a bulk dirac field corresponding to the nucleon at the boundary@xcite .",
    "this hard - wall model was applied to describe the neutron electric dipole moment@xcite and holographic nuclear matter@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the nucleons are the massless chiral isospin doublets @xmath28 and @xmath29 which satisfy the t hooft anomaly matching .",
    "then the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry induces a chirally symmetric mass term for nucleons @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the nonlinear pseudo - goldstone boson field that transforms as @xmath32 under @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the su(2 ) pauli matrices and the pion decay constant , respectively .",
    "thus , we have to consider the following mass term in the ads side @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the mass coupling ( or yukawa coupling ) between @xmath13 and nucleon fields , which is usually fitted by reproducing the nucleon mass @xmath37 mev . in this regard , we can introduce two 5d dirac spinors @xmath38 and @xmath39 of which the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes should include the excitations of the massless chiral nucleons @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . by this requirement , one can fix the ir boundary conditions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath4 .",
    "note that the 5d spinors @xmath40 do not have chirality .",
    "however , one can resolve this problem in such a way that the 4d chirality is encoded in the sign of the 5d dirac mass term . for a positive 5d mass ,",
    "only the right - handed component of the 5d spnior remains near the uv boundary @xmath41 , which plays the role of a source for the left - handed chiral operator in 4 dimension .",
    "it is vice versa for a negative 5d mass .",
    "the 5d mass for the @xmath42 bulk dimensional spinor is determined by the ads / cft expression @xmath43 and turns out to be @xmath44 . however , since qcd does not have conformal symmetry in the low - energy regime , the 5d mass might acquire an anomalous dimension due to a 5d renormalization flow .",
    "though it is not known how to derive it , we will introduce some anomalous dimension to see its effects on the spectrum of the nucleon .    summarizing all these facts ,",
    "we are led to the 5d gauge action for the nucleons @xmath45 , \\cr { \\cal l}_{\\mathrm{k } } & = &   i \\bar{n}_1   \\gamma^m \\nabla_m n_1 + i \\bar{n}_2   \\gamma^m \\nabla_m n_2   % \\nonumber\\\\ & &   - \\frac52 \\bar{n}_1 n_2 +   \\frac52 \\bar{n}_2 n_1 \\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}_{\\mathrm{i } } & = & -g\\left [ \\bar{n}_1 x",

    "the @xmath49 matrices are related to the ordinary @xmath50 matrices as @xmath51 .",
    "the more details of the present approach can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "before presenting the results of this work , we note the most of input parameters of the model such as @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath52 are quite well fitted in the mesonic sector  @xcite .",
    "hence , we have only one free parameter @xmath36 to reproduce the data in the baryonic sector",
    ". however , the ir cutoff @xmath52 in the baryonic sector , which is often interpreted as a scale of the confinement , takes different values from those in the mesonic sector .",
    "actually , ref .",
    "@xcite performed two different fittings of these parameters . in the first fitting of ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath52 and the @xmath15 were fixed in the mesonic sector , and the @xmath36 is fitted to the nucleon mass . in the second",
    "fitting , the @xmath52 and the @xmath36 were taken respectively to be @xmath53 and @xmath54 such that the masses of the nucleon and the roper resonance @xmath55 were reproduced .",
    "since there is no reason for a nucleon to have the same scale of the confinement as that for a meson , this might be an acceptable argument as far as one treats mesons and baryons separately .",
    "however , there is one caveat . when it comes to some observables such as the meson - baryon coupling constants , we need to treat the mesons and baryons on the same footing and",
    "require inevitably a common @xmath52 . otherwise , we are not able to consider whole information on both mesons and baryons",
    ". moreover , a model uncertainty brings on by the mass coupling @xmath36 .",
    "thus , in the present section , we will carry out the numerical analysis very carefully , keeping in mind all these facts .",
    "we first take different values of the @xmath52 from those in the mesonic sector and try to fit the data as was done in ref .  @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath15 is defined as @xmath56 . in general",
    ", one can examine two different limits of the mass coupling @xmath36 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) : in the limit of the small mass coupling , there are three free parameters @xmath14 , @xmath36 and @xmath52 .",
    "all other parameters can be related to @xmath52 . on the other hand , in the limit of the strong mass coupling",
    ", the @xmath36 can be fixed by some condition  @xcite , which leaves only two free parameters .",
    "obviously , the dependence on the current quark mass @xmath14 must be tiny because of its smallness , so we can simply neglect it . in this case",
    ", we have only one free parameter .    [ tabh ]",
    "the results of the calculations are listed in table  [ tabh ] . in the upper part of the table",
    ", we present the results in the limit of the strong mass coupling .",
    "they are more or less the same as those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . for comparison",
    ", we list the results for the small mass coupling in the lower part of table  [ tabh ] where the mass coupling @xmath36 is chosen to be @xmath57 . while the spectrum of the nucleon seems to be qualitatively well reproduced , that of the @xmath58 meson is fairly underestimated in comparison with the experimental data . in the case of the strong mass coupling ,",
    "the situation becomes even worse .",
    "one can note however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ordering of the nucleon - parity states are correctly reproduced for @xmath59 .",
    "the results listed in table  [ tabh ] indicate that it is not possible to reproduce the spectra of the @xmath58 meson and the nucleon at the same time .. ] as an attempt to improve the above - presented results , we want to introduce an anomalous dimension of the 5d nucleon mass while the 5d mass of the bulk vector field does not acquire any anomalous dimension because of the gauge symmetry .",
    "the results are drawn in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "one can see that , when anomalous dimension is set to zero ( i.e. @xmath44 is fixed ) , the experimental data is badly reproduced .",
    "the inclusion of an additional parameter ( i.e. considering @xmath60 as a free parameter ) improves the output data well but leads to larger values of the possible anomalous dimension .",
    "note that here the nucleon mass is not used as an input .",
    "varying the value of @xmath60 , we try to fit the spectrum of the nucleon .",
    "we present the results from two different parameter sets called model a and model b. in this analysis , we take the values of the @xmath52 and @xmath15 from ref .",
    "note that the @xmath58 meson mass is used as an input in model a , while model b corresponds to the global fitting done in ref .",
    "the 5d nucleon mass is varied in the range of @xmath61 , its anomalous dimension being considered as mentioned before .",
    "as shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] , the best result is obtained with @xmath62 .",
    "though the absolute value of the nucleon mass turn out to be overestimated in contrast to the previous analysis presented in table  [ tabh ] , qualitatively it is well reproduced within @xmath63 while @xmath58 meson mass is fitted around its experimental value .",
    "we are now in a position to include meson - baryon coupling constants in the present numerical analysis .",
    "we will consider here the @xmath64 and the @xmath65 coupling constants in addition to the @xmath58 meson and the nucleon spectra .",
    "one has to keep in mind that in order to calculate the meson - baryon coupling constants it is essential to use the same @xmath52 for the mesonic and baryonic sectors .",
    "otherwise , it is not possible to keep whole information on the wavefunctions .",
    "thus , it is of utmost importance to compute all observables with the same set of parameters .",
    "we perform a global fitting procedure to obtain the results listed in table  [ globfitg ] .",
    "note that we consider here the chiral limit ( @xmath66 ) , since its effects on the results are rather tiny .. for instance , @xmath67 in the chiral limit  @xcite . ]",
    "[ globfitg ]    we assume also that the 5d nucleon mass acquires a large anomalous dimension so that it may vanish , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "the best fit is obtained with the parameters fitted as follows : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the masses of the ground - state nucleon and the @xmath58 meson are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , those of the excited states are qualitatively well reproduced within @xmath71 . however , the coupling constants are in general about @xmath72 underestimated .",
    "we mention that in ref .",
    "@xcite the dependence of the meson - baryon coupling constants on the @xmath52 was investigated without considering hadron spectra but the results for the coupling constants are more or less in the same level as in the present work .",
    "we have investigated the mesons and the nucleons in a unified approach , based on a hard - wall model of ads / qcd  @xcite . in order to study the nucleon spectrum ,",
    "we have developed an approximated method in which the effective potential can be expanded .",
    "the method of this approximation was shown to work very well .",
    "in particular , the correct ordering of the nucleon parity states was _ analytically _ as well as _",
    "explicitly _ shown in this method .",
    "@xcite    we then have performed several numerical analyzes , varying the model parameters such as the ir cutoff @xmath52 , the quark condensate @xmath15 , and the mass coupling ( or yukawa coupling ) @xmath36 . in order to improve the results of the nucleon and the @xmath58 meson spectra on an equal footing , we have introduced an anomalous dimension of the 5d nucleon mass .",
    "we found that the zero 5d nucleon mass , @xmath73 , produces the best fit .",
    "we have proceeded to compute the @xmath74 and @xmath65 coupling constants with the same ir cutoff @xmath52 used .",
    "this is crucial in order to keep whole information about the wavefunctions .",
    "we carried out the global fitting procedure in which we obtained the best fit with the values of the parameters : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "the mass spectra of the nucleon and the @xmath58 meson are in relatively good agreement with the experimental data within @xmath71 , whereas the @xmath74 and @xmath65 coupling constants underestimated by about @xmath72 .",
    "last but not least , we want to mention the following significant point . while the present ads / qcd model for",
    "the baryon respects some important physics such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , it still suffers from a serious flaw . any construction of ads / qcd models must satisfy the uv matching with qcd .",
    "however , the present framework of the ads / qcd model for the baryon does not match the ope results of qcd .",
    "it indicates that there is still a very important component missing in the present version of the model , that is , the correct surface terms in the 5d effective action are missing .",
    "the corresponding investigation is under way  @xcite .",
