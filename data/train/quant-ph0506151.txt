    "the significance of this move is that @xmath159 has the same entanglement and the same overlap with the @xmath160 subspace as does @xmath2 .",

    "the negativity is an entanglement monotone  @xcite , and it is straightforward to evaluate .",
    "the negativity does not , however , identify all entangled states .",
    "there are states , the bound entangled states , that have a positive partial transpose and thus zero negativity , yet are still entangled .",
    "notice that there are no such states in the one - parameter family of rotationally symmetric states .",
    "to get around the inability of the negativity to identify all entangled states , the convex - roof - extended negativity , @xmath253 , has been proposed as a mixed - state entanglement measure .",
    "this comes with a considerably increased difficulty in computation , of the sort associated with any convex - roof entanglement measure , but the convex - roof - extended negativity has been evaluated for the isotropic states and werner states  @xcite .    for @xmath130 $ ] , the partial transpose of the rotationally symmetric state @xmath231 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : invariantstate ] ) has two eigenvalues @xmath254 the first of which is @xmath255-fold degenerate , and the second of which is @xmath207-fold degenerate and is negative for @xmath256 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "thus the negativity of @xmath231 is @xmath257\\;.\\ ] ]    to find the convex - roof - extended negativity , we note that for the states  ( [ eq : schmidt ] ) , @xmath258 .",
    "this means that for rotationally symmetric states , the convex - roof - extended negativity is actually identical to the i - concurrence  ( [ eq : icon ] ) , @xmath259",
    "we have computed the entanglement of formation of rotationally symmetric states for a @xmath260$]-dimensional system .",
    "three features of the problem simplified the endeavor : the rotationally invariant states are specified by a single parameter , pure states that are twirled to an invariant state are determined by a single constraint , and only one local unitary is needed to relate the pure states to a fiducial state .",
    "the first makes finding the convex hull in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cofepsilon ] ) easier , and the other two allow one to efficiently characterize the subset of pure states over which one minimizes in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon ] ) .",
    "these elements were also vital in all other applications of the terhal - vollbrecht - werner procedure to date , i.e. , generalized werner states and isotropic states .",
    "the rotationally symmetric states of a spin-@xmath0 particle and a spin-@xmath15 particle are similar in some ways to the states of a two - qubit system : positive partial transpose is necessary and sufficient for separability , and the pure states @xmath261 in the optimal decomposition all have the same entanglement .",
    "the entanglement in these states vanishes as one spin becomes more classical ( @xmath262 ) .",
    "we have also determined the i - concurrence , tangle , and the convex - roof negativity of the rotationally symmetric states .",
    "these all display the same features as the entanglement of formation .",
    "this is quite different from what occurs for the isotropic states in high dimensions , where the concurrence is linear  @xcite , the tangle has the same behavior as the entanglement of formation  @xcite , and the convex - roof negativity is the same as the negativity of the isotropic state  @xcite .",
    "since we have determined an optimal decomposition , we can also find the entanglement of formation of states that are not rotationally symmetric .",
    "this procedure for extending optimal decompositions to other states was outlined by vollbrecht and werner  @xcite : arbitrary convex combinations of the pure states @xmath263 have the same entanglement as the rotationally symmetric states , which are uniform convex combinations of these states .",
    "this extension procedure does not cover the entire space ; the states for which it does apply and their properties are currently being investigated .    we have examined the simplest case of rotationally invariant states , and the next step , which we are pursuing , is to investigate two spin-1 particles , where the rotationally symmetric states constitute a two - parameter family .",
    "for two spin-1 particles , it is known that the positive partial transpose condition is necessary and sufficient for separability , and the entanglement of a large fraction of the rotationally symmetric states can be obtained from extending the decompositions for generalized werner states and isotropic states @xcite . however the calculation for the rest of the states poses some difficulties , because the important features that facilitated the calculations in this paper are now absent .",
    "the states are functions of two variables , there are two constraints on the pure states , instead of one , and it becomes difficult to characterize efficiently the states that are twirled to an invariant state .",
    "in particular , the technique used to remove the unitary on one subsystem , thus obtaining eq .",
    "( [ eq : fiducial ] ) , no longer applies .",
    "the entire problem gets progressively more difficult as the spins of the two particles increase ."
