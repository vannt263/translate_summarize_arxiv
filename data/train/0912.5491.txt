    "giant star radii have been measured in the past using various interferometers , including the mark iii ( 85 giants and supergiants , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the palomar testbed interferometer ( 69 giants and supergiants , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the navy prototype optical interferometer ( 50 giants and supergiants , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) array ( 4 hyades giants , * ? ? ?",
    "these measurements are valuable because these are the stars populating the coolest , most luminous part of the hertzsprung - russell ( h - r ) diagram @xcite .",
    "what makes the sample of giant stars under consideration here particularly interesting is that they are potential exoplanet hosts , and planetary candidates have been discovered around six of the stars already .",
    "two important characteristics of a star are its mass and radius . for giant stars ,",
    "the determination of these parameters is indirect and heavily model dependent . in practice ,",
    "spectroscopic observations to measure the surface gravities ( log  @xmath0 ) , effective temperatures ( @xmath1 ) , and iron abundances ( [ fe / h ] ) can be combined with a distance measurement to derive the stellar radius .",
    "fitting evolutionary tracks to the position of the star in the h - r diagram then yields the mass .",
    "the reliability of these measurements depend both on the validity of the model atmospheres and the stellar evolution code .",
    "unfortunately this is an uncertain process because the evolutionary tracks of stars with a wide range of masses all converge to near the same region of the h - r diagram as they evolve up the giant branch .",
    "in particular the mass estimates derived from evolutionary tracks depend critically on several parameters hidden in the tracks , such as the mixing length parameter and its assumed constancy for all stars , the unknown helium content in the core , and uncertainties about the nature of the convection zone . as a result , using different tracks can produce different masses , and in the absence of good calibrating objects no set of tracks can be claimed to provide the best results . on the other hand ,",
    "if one can test and calibrate these evolutionary tracks by comparing the theoretically - determined mass and radius to observed values , then one can have some faith in applying these tracks to stars for which direct measurements of these stellar parameters is not possible .    a star s mass is not only important for its evolution , but it should play an important role in the type of planetary system a star will form .",
    "there are a number of doppler surveys searching for planets around evolved giant stars with stellar masses of 1 to 2 @xmath2 .",
    "all are plagued by the same problem in that they rely on evolutionary tracks to determine the stellar mass . until these are calibrated",
    "both the mass of the host star and the planet are uncertain .",
    "a more reliable means of calculating the stellar mass independent of evolutionary tracks and model atmospheres is using stellar oscillation observations , as the frequency of stellar oscillations is related to the mean density of the star . if one has an accurate stellar radius it is simple to compute a stellar mass from the oscillation frequencies that is model independent .",
    "depending on the accuracy of the diameter measurements , the masses can be measured to an accuracy of @xmath32@xmath4 to @xmath315@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there is increasing evidence that most and possibly all giant stars show stellar oscillations , which are due to p - mode oscillations where pressure is the restoring force .",
    "thus giant stars are an ideal class of objects for deriving fundamental stellar parameters .",
    "they are abundant , they have large angular diameters suitable for interferometric measurements , and they exhibit stellar oscillations with radial velocity amplitudes of a few to several tens of m / s , which are easily measurable by state - of - the - art techniques .",
    "the observed oscillation frequencies constrain the internal structure of the star @xcite and interferometry measures the star s size , and the combination leads to the mass of the star .",
    "once stellar isochrones have been refined and calibrated for these evolved stars , they can be used to determine the masses of all planet - hosting giant stars . because collecting data on the oscillation frequencies requires considerable telescope resources and can only be done for relatively few stars , we first present our results on interferometric measurements on a larger sample of giant stars .",
    "the advantage interferometry provides is the ability to directly measure stellar angular diameters .",
    "once the angular diameters are known for these giant stars , physical radii and effective temperatures can be calculated when combined with other parameters , such as the parallax , bolometric flux , interstellar absorption , and bolometric corrections .",
    "the radii and effective temperatures are important values that characterize the parent star as well as the environment in which the exoplanet resides for those stars hosting planets .",
    "section 2 describes the spectroscopic measurements of @xmath1 and log  @xmath0 for the sample , @xmath53 discusses the interferometric observations , @xmath54 explains how the angular diameters , linear radii , and @xmath1 were determined , and @xmath55 explores the physical implications of the interferometric observations .",
    "our sample of k giant stars were obtained from the planet search survey of @xcite . as part of this program the @xmath1 and log  @xmath0 were measured , which allowed us to estimate the stellar radii and masses .",
    "table  [ spec ] lists the 25 stars observed here , and planets have already been found orbiting hd  73108 @xcite , hd  139357 and hd  170693 @xcite , hd  32518 and hd  136726 @xcite , and hd  167042 @xcite .",
    "three additional stars show long - period variations in their radial velocity measurements : hd  106574 , hd  157681 , and hd  200205 @xcite .",
    "the targets chosen for our observing list are bright ( @xmath6 ) giant stars that showed significant short - term variability indicative of stellar pulsations , which made them excellent candidates for both stellar oscillation observations and interferometric measurements .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were carried out using the coud chelle spectrograph of the 2-m - alfred jensch telescope of the thringer landessternwarte tautenburg .",
    "the spectrograph has a resolving power of @xmath7 and the wavelength range used was 4700 to 7400  .",
    "standard iraf routines were used for subtracting the bias offset , flat - fielding , subtracting the scattered light , extracting the spectra , and for the wavelength calibration .    in order to determine the stellar parameters from the spectra , a grid of model atmospheres from @xcite was used in which a plane - parallel atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium was assumed .",
    "we selected 144 unblended fei and 8 feii lines in the wavelength range 5806 and 6858  using the line list of @xcite .",
    "the iron abundance [ fe / h ] was determined by assuming that fei lines of different equivalent widths have to give the same relative abundance of iron .",
    "for the effective temperature , an excitation equilibrium of fei and feii for lines of different excitation potentials was used , and the surface gravity was determined from the ionization balance of fei to feii lines @xcite .",
    "the resulting [ fe / h ] , @xmath1 , and log  @xmath0 values are listed in table  [ spec ] .",
    "interferometric observations were obtained using the chara array , a six element optical - infrared interferometer located on mount wilson , california @xcite .",
    "all observations used the pupil - plane `` chara classic '' beam combiner in the @xmath8-band at 2.15  @xmath9 m while visible wavelengths ( 470 - 800 nm ) were used for tracking and tip / tilt corrections . the observing procedure and data reduction process employed here",
    "are described in @xcite .",
    "we interleaved calibrator and target star observations so that every target was flanked by calibrator observations made as close in time as possible , which allowed us to convert instrumental target and calibrator visibilities to calibrated visibilities for the target .",
    "reliable calibrators were chosen to be single stars with expected visibility amplitudes @xmath1085@xmath4 so they were nearly unresolved on the baselines used , which meant uncertainties in the calibrator s diameter did not affect the target s diameter calculation as much as if the calibrator star had a significant angular size . in a few cases , a calibrator had a stellar companion but at such a distance that light from the secondary star would not contaminate our interferometric measurements and the calibrator could therefore be treated as a single star .    to check for possible unseen close companions that would contaminate our observations , we created spectral energy distribution ( sed )",
    "fits based on published @xmath11 photometric values obtained from the literature for each calibrator to establish diameter estimates .",
    "this also allowed us to see if there was any excess emission associated with a low - mass stellar companion or circumstellar disk .",
    "calibrator candidates showing displaying variable radial velocities or any other indication of companions were discarded .",
    "we used kurucz model atmospheres based on @xmath1 and log  @xmath0 values to calculate limb - darkened angular diameters for the calibrators .",
    "the stellar models were fit to observed photometry after converting magnitudes to fluxes using @xcite for @xmath12 values and @xcite for @xmath13 values .",
    "see table [ observations ] for the @xmath1 and log  @xmath0 used and the resulting limb - darkened angular diameters .",
    "the observed quantity of an interferometer is defined as the visibility ( @xmath14 ) , which is fit to a model of a uniformly - illuminated disk ( ud ) that represents the observed face of the star .",
    "diameter fits to @xmath14 were based upon the ud approximation given by @xmath15 / x$ ] , where @xmath16 is the first - order bessel function and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the projected baseline at the star s position , @xmath19 is the apparent ud angular diameter of the star , and @xmath20 is the effective wavelength of the observation @xcite .",
    "a more realistic model of a star s disk involves limb - darkening ( ld ) , and relationship incorporating the linear limb darkening coefficient @xmath21 @xcite is : @xmath22 .\\ ] ] table  [ calib_visy ] lists the modified julian date ( mjd ) , projected baseline ( @xmath18 ) at the time of observation , projected baseline position angle ( @xmath23 ) , calibrated visibility ( @xmath24 ) , and error in @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) for each giant star observed .",
    "figures [ stack_all ] through [ others ] show the ld diameter fits for all the stars .",
    "the limb - darkening coefficient was obtained from @xcite after adopting the @xmath1 and log  @xmath0 values required for each star observed .",
    "the resulting ld angular diameters are listed in table  [ inf ] .",
    "the average difference between the ud and ld diameters are on the order of a few percent , and the final angular diameters are little affected by the choice of @xmath21 .",
    "all but four stars have @xmath26 errors of 2@xmath4 or less , three of the four have errors of only 3@xmath4 , and the final star has a 5@xmath4 error . additionally , the combination of the interferometric measurement of the star s angular diameter plus the _ hipparcos _ parallax @xcite allowed us to determine the star s physical radius .",
    "the results are also listed in table  [ inf ] . in principle",
    ", one can calculate the mass of each star from the physical radius and log @xmath0 values .",
    "however , the formal errors in log @xmath0 lead to errors in such mass estimates near the 50@xmath4 level , thereby significantly decreasing their usefulness to this analysis .    for each @xmath26 fit",
    ", the errors were derived via the reduced @xmath27 minimization method @xcite : the diameter fit with the lowest @xmath27 was found and the corresponding diameter was the final @xmath26 for the star .",
    "the errors were calculated by finding the diameter at @xmath28 on either side of the minimum @xmath27 and determining the difference between the @xmath27 diameter and @xmath29 diameter . in calculating the diameter errors in table  [ inf ] , we adjusted the estimated visibility errors to force the reduced @xmath27 to unity because when this is omitted , the reduced @xmath27 is well under 1.0 , indicating we are overestimating the errors in our calibrated visibilities .",
    "limb - darkened angular diameters were estimated using the relationship described in @xcite between the ( @xmath30 ) color and log @xmath26 ( see @xmath31 in table  [ spec ] ) .",
    "the table also lists @xmath32 , which were derived using @xmath31 and the stars parallaxes .",
    "the major weakness of this method lies in the uncertainties surrounding the @xmath33-magnitudes , which were taken from two sources : _ the two - micron sky survey _",
    "( tmss , * ? ? ?",
    "* errors @xmath32 - 5@xmath4 ) and _ the 2mass all - sky catalog of point sources _ ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* errors @xmath36 - 12@xmath4 ) .",
    "preference was given to the former because 2mass measurements saturate at magnitudes brighter than @xmath33.5 in the @xmath33-band even when using the shortest exposure time .",
    "the large errors associated with 2mass magnitudes for these bright stars led to large errors in angular diameter and physical radii estimates .    once @xmath26 was determined interferometrically , the @xmath1 was calculated using the relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the bolometric flux and @xmath36 is the stefan - bolzmann constant .",
    "the stars @xmath14 and @xmath33 magnitudes were dereddened using the extinction curve described in @xcite and interstellar absorption ( @xmath37 ) values were from except for hd  113049 and hd  176408 , which had no @xmath37 in the literature .",
    "@xmath37 values for these two stars were estimated through a non - linear , least squares fit and a reddening prescription from @xcite , who presented a wavelength - dependent extinction curve .",
    "the intrinsic broad - band color ( @xmath30 ) was calculated and bolometric corrections ( bcs ) were determined by interpolating between the [ fe / h ] = + 0.2 , 0.0 , and -1.0 tables found in .",
    "they point out that in the range of 6000 k @xmath38 4000 k , their bc calibration is symmetrically distributed around a @xmath390.10 magnitude band when compared to other calibrations .",
    "the average bc used here is 0.55 , and because 0.10 is 18@xmath4 of 0.55 , we assigned a 18@xmath4 error bar to our bc values .",
    "the bolometric flux was determined by applying the bc for each star and the @xmath1 was calculated ( see table  [ inf ] ) .",
    "all @xmath1 errors are @xmath40 , 11 stars have errors of @xmath41 , and the major source of error in calculating @xmath1 stemmed , again , from uncertainties in @xmath33-magnitudes .",
    "giant star masses were estimated using the param stellar model1.0 ] from with a modified version of the method described in .",
    "the input parameters for each star were its interferometrically - measured @xmath1 , its spectroscopically - derived [ fe / h ] , its @xmath14 magnitude from @xcite , and its hipparcos parallax @xcite along with the corresponding error for each value .",
    "the model used these inputs to estimate each star s age , mass , radius , @xmath42 , and log  @xmath0 using the isochrones and a bayesian estimating method , calculating the probability density function separately for each property in question .",
    "da silva et al .",
    "qualify mass estimates as `` more uncertain '' than other properties , so the resulting masses listed in table  [ spec ] should be viewed as a rough estimates only .",
    "in order to check how well the estimated and measured angular diameters agreed , we plotted photometrically - estimated versus interferometrically - measured angular diameters in figure  [ calcobs ] , and figure  [ radii ] shows a similar plot for physical radii .",
    "the angular diameters determined using @xmath33-band photometry from 2mass show generally higher errors in figure  [ calcobs ] than the diameters determined using tmss photometry .",
    "this plot clearly shows the advantage of measuring angular diameters interferometrically , as the errors are significantly smaller than the photometric estimates in all cases .",
    "there is an even scatter around the 1:1 ratio line , and all but two stars are within 1@xmath36 of the line .",
    "the outliers in both figures  [ calcobs ] and [ radii ] are hd  118904 and hd  157681 .",
    "neither star shows any sign of binarity in the literature , and the seds created using the @xmath1 and log  @xmath0 based on their spectral type and @xcite do not show any excess in the infrared wavelengths that would suggest a low - mass stellar companion or a circumstellar disk . in both cases",
    ", the problem may lie with the calibrator stars chosen .",
    "hd  157681 was observed using the calibrator hd  158460 , and though the latter has a small estimated diameter ( 0.268@xmath390.016 mas ) and its sed shows no excess flux in the infrared that would indicate a low - mass stellar companion or circumstellar disk , hd  157681 was the only star observed with that calibrator and there could be an unseen companion that is not taken into account when estimating the star s diameter .",
    "future observations of hd  157681 with different calibrators will make the situation clearer .",
    "hd  118904 was observed using hd  124063 as a calibrator , and the same calibrator was used to observe the target star hd  113049 along with the second calibrator hd  107193 . when the data were calibrated separately for hd  113049",
    ", the diameters showed a 0.08 mas difference , which is on the order of an 8@xmath4 change .",
    "if hd  118904 s diameter is reduced by 8@xmath4 , the data point is within errors on the 1:1 ratio line for both plots in figures  [ calcobs ] and [ radii ] .",
    "because this is the case , only hd  107193 was used in the calibration of hd  113049 s data , and the angular diameter , radius , and @xmath1 listed in table  [ inf ] are based on those data alone .",
    "figure [ radii ] shows that while a fair number of photometric and interferometric radii agree very well , there are some that show slight discrepancies , notwithstanding the error bars .",
    "this could be due to a few different effects .",
    "first , the photometrically - determined radii depend on temperature estimates that may not be correct .",
    "if the star is highly active or there is a very faint companion , these could affect the temperature and therefore radii estimates2.5 magnitudes fainter than the host star , the effects of the secondart star will be not seen in interferometric observations and would therefore have no effect on the angular diameter or physical radii measurements . ] .",
    "second , the limb - darkening law used to determine interferometric diameters and radii may not take certain stellar features into account , such as starspots or extremely active regions .",
    "this would not be a large effect because even altering the limb - darkening coefficient @xmath21 by 20@xmath4 changes the limb - darkened angular diameter by an average of 0.7@xmath4 .",
    "third , the differences may be due to changes in the stars convections zones , because as the star evolves the convection zone gets deeper .",
    "convection is not well modeled , which may lead to errors in the photometric radii estimates .",
    "we also plotted the interferometrically - measured @xmath1 versus those derived spectroscopically in figure  [ tcompare ] .",
    "there is some scatter off the 1:1 ratio line , particularly for the cooler stars .",
    "the errors in @xmath1 do not show a trend with log  @xmath0 , diameter , radius , @xmath43 color , distance , spectral type , metallicity , or bolometric correction .",
    "the discrepancies may be due to the inherent properties of the methods used to measure @xmath1 .",
    "spectroscopic values are based on fei and feii lines and measure the @xmath1 in the part of the atmosphere where those lines are present , while interferometry calculates the overall @xmath1 of the star using the measured diameter .",
    "it has been surmised that atmospheric models of k giant stars in the near - ultraviolet band are missing a source of thermal extinction , which would also affect the @xmath1 measurements @xcite .",

    "<S> our values match angular diameters and physical radii estimated using photometric methods to within the associated errors with the advantage that our uncertainties are significantly lower . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated the effective temperatures for the stars using the newly - measured diameters . </S>",
    "<S> our values do not match those derived from spectroscopic observations as well , perhaps due to the inherent properties of the methods used or because of a missing source of extinction in the stellar models that would affect the spectroscopic temperatures . </S>"
