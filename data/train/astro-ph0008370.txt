    "nearly all of our knowledge about the masses and ages of low mass young stars comes from their location in the hr diagram relative to theoretical calculations of stellar evolution to the main sequence . despite considerable advances over the past 5 - 10 years in understanding the structure and atmospheres of stars of mass m@xmath1 ,",
    "comparison of the currently available predicted evolutionary paths of young stars shows obvious differences .",
    "empirical tests of the calculations have not been possible until recently because astronomers have not had independent measurements of either the mass or age of a young star .",

    "one way to test the calculated tracks is to investigate whether they yield the same ages for stars expected to be coeval on physical grounds .",
    "hartigan et al . ( 1994 ) , casey et al . ( 1998 ) , and white et al .  ( 1999 ) have applied this test to wide binaries , the ty cra system , and the gg tau system , respectively , using tracks available at the time . over a mass range extending down to the brown dwarfs",
    ", they found significant differences in the extent to which the several theoretical calculations satisfy the coevality requirement .",
    "the capability of mm - wave interferometers to resolve the spectral line emission of the outer disks of pms stars offers the possibility to map their rotation . since the disk mass is usually very small compared to the mass of the star , this provides the means to measure the stellar mass dynamically ( e.g. dutrey et al .",

    "the tuning was purely in the lower side band .",
    "the continuum and line maps were produced using natural weighting of the visibilities . for clarity , tapering to about @xmath14 resolution was used on line maps presented in figs.1 and 2 , but the full angular resolution was used in the fitting of models by the @xmath15 technique .",
    "we did not subtract the continuum emission from the co map because its contribution is small , but included it in the analysis .",
    "the essential inputs are the angularly resolved maps of the co line emission at each velocity channel and the `` standard '' model of a rotating disk in hydrostatic equilibrium ( e.g. dgs94 ) .",
    "we use the procedure developed by gd98 to derive the parameters of the model by the method of @xmath15 minimization . in order to avoid nonlinear effects arising from deconvolution",
    ", the @xmath15 minimization is performed in the _ u , v _ plane .",
    "the derived parameters divide naturally into those relevant for the determination of the central mass and those that pertain mostly to the properties of the disk . here , with the exception of dm tau , for which we summarize the complete analysis , we will concentrate on the parameters required to determine the central mass - the disk inclination @xmath16 and position angle @xmath17 , @xmath18 sin@xmath16 at @xmath19 = 100 au , the exponent @xmath20 of the rotation curve @xmath21 and the outer disk radius @xmath22 . a paper describing the disk parameters ( e.g. the temperature radial distribution , the @xmath0co abundance and spectral line turbulence width ) is in preparation .",

    "they used d=150 pc for the distance to dm tau . since we now adopt 140 pc as the reference distance , we scale gd98 s results to this value . on this basis , gd98 s value for dm tau s mass is @xmath23pc )  @xmath24 ( table 3 ) .",

    "1a shows that dm tau , gm aur , lkca15 and mwc480 appear to have no co emission from the parent cloud .",
    "uz tau e and dl tau ( fig .",
    "1b ) suffer some confusion with the co emission of the cloud .",
    "confusion is maximum at the cloud systemic velocity , which is usually ( but not always , see dl tau ) the stellar velocity . hence it preferentially affects the disk emission which is elongated along the projected disk minor axis .",
    "this results in an incorrect estimate of the disk inclination . in the case of cy tau",
    ", we can not be sure about the level of confusion because of the weakness of its co emission . for uz tau e and dl tau ,",
    "the velocity channels hidden by the foreground co cloud have been removed from the @xmath15 analysis . in the case of uz tau e ,",
    "4 out of 36 significant channels were removed . in the case of dl tau , 5 out of 18 significant channels had to be removed because of confusion .",
    "this increased the uncertainty in the disk inclination quite significantly .",
    "the first step of the model fitting procedure is to measure the coordinates of the mm - wave continuum source in order to recenter the @xmath25 plane visibilities on it .",
    "table 2 lists these source coordinates for dm tau and for the other stars newly observed for this program .",
    "the uz tau e spectroscopic binary can not be resolved by our observations ; its continuum source coordinates must be effectively centered on the binary .",
    "table 3 compares the results of the full analysis of dm tau obtained by gd98 from their analysis of the @xmath0co 1 - 0 data at @xmath26 resolution with that derived from our new @xmath0co j=2 - 1 data .",
    "only the fitted parameters are shown ; the gas density and @xmath0co abundance are the same in the two analyses and do not affect the stellar mass determination because the @xmath0co j= 1 - 0 and j= 2 - 1 lines are optically thick .",
    "we scaled gd98 s values of the parameters that depend on physical size , and hence distance , from 150 pc distance to the 140 pc distance used here .",
    "the uncertainties are the formal 2@xmath27 values from the @xmath15 fit .",
    "the position angles in table 3 refer to the major axis of the disk ; the pa listed in gd98 is that for the disk rotation axis so differs by 90@xmath8 from the pa@xmath28 given here .",
    "the agreement between gd98 and the new results is excellent for all the parameters except for the inclination which now has the opposite sign .",
    "it is not surprising that the higher resolution data better define the sense of the inclination .",
    "its sign does not affect the mass determination .",
    "table 4 lists the parameters most relevant for determination of the central mass derived from our new observations and also from our previously published observations .",
    "columns 2 and 3 are described below .",

    "the stellar masses in col . 8",
    "are derived using @xmath30 where 2.98 km / s is the circular velocity at 100 au radius from a 1   star .",
    "the derived masses scale as @xmath31 and hence depend on distance to the star as @xmath32 .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in the measured stellar mass is the inclination ; the two objects in our sample with the lowest inclinations , cy tau and bp tau , have the highest uncertainties in their derived masses .",
    "this approach ignores the mass of the disk because it is usually only a few per cent that of the star . even in gg",
    "tau a , which probably has the most massive disk of the stars in our sample , the mass of the circumbinary is only @xmath33 that of the stars within it ( guilloteau et al .",
    "it is interesting that uz tau e has a circumbinary ring like gg tau a and uy aur ( duvert et al .",
    "1998 ) , although the central hole is as yet unresolved .",
    "the 1.3 mm continuum emission is detected by a separate back - end (  2.2 ) and the detected continuum emission arises mostly from the innermost regions of the disk ( see below ) .",
    "the continuum images can therefore provide independent measurements of the disk orientation .",
    "cols.2 - 3 of table 4 give the position angle , pa@xmath34 of the major axis of the disk , and its inclination , @xmath35 , measured from the 1.3 mm wavelength continuum image .",
    "to derive the inclination from the ratio of apparent major and minor axes , we used an effective seeing of 0.3@xmath12 .",
    "we did not include uncertainty in the seeing in the error estimate .",
    "the agreement between the orientations and inclinations derived from 1.3 mm continuum data and @xmath0co j=2 - 1 data is excellent for most of the targets .",
    "the uncertainties of the values derived from the continuum images are larger , in most cases , than those from the co data because the measured sizes of the disks in the continuum are generally smaller than in co , specially when the inclinations are low .",
    "the sizes measured in the continuum are smaller because the dust continuum opacity is much smaller than in the co line .",
    "the detected continuum emission therefore arises mostly in the dense inner regions of the disks ( see , for example , d96 ) .",
    "the values for cytau suffer from low signal to noise . in the case",
    "dltau , significant confusion from the molecular cloud seems to have affected the determination of the inclination from the co emission (  3 ) .",
    "the confusion affects the channels near the systemic velocity , which are the most important to determine the inclination . accordingly , pending better measurements ( e.g. @xmath36co ) , we prefer to use the inclination determined from the continuum emission , @xmath37 , to derive the mass for dltau . with this inclination ,",
    "the stellar mass is @xmath38 , rather than @xmath39   when using the co derived inclination .",
    "the observational measure of the stellar photospheric temperature is its spectral type while the parameter provided by the models is usually @xmath40 .",
    "the surface gravities of the pms stars lie between those of the main sequence stars and giants so the conversion between spectral type and t@xmath6 determined for the giants and dwarfs may not apply .",
    "white et al .  ( 1999 ) and luhman ( 1999 ) , in addition to others , have investigated this problem and demonstrate that the differences in temperature scales become apparent for the lowest mass stars , and below the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "luhman ( 1999 ) proposed an `` intermediate '' temperature scale for the m stars .",
    "its differences from kenyon and hartmann s ( 1995 ) temperature scale become significant for stars cooler than about m6 . since our sample",
    "does not include stars as cool as this , we use the kenyon and hartmann scale in the present work without modification .    the hr diagram in fig .",
    "2a shows excerpts from pms tracks calculated by dm97 , bcah , ps99 and sdf . in this and subsequent figures",

    "differences among the theoretical calculations for a star of given age and mass are obvious .",
    "for example , the dm97 tracks are hotter than those of bcah for @xmath43 .",
    "sdf s models at 0.2 and 0.1  appear to contract more slowly than those of dm97 , bcah , and ps99 .",
    "since the different treatments of stellar convection , the equation of state , opacities , and stellar atmospheres become important in specific regions of the hr diagram , tests of the theoretical tracks require accurate measurements of mass over as wide a range of mass and age as possible .",
    "the dependence of @xmath44 on distance (  3 ) is important because while the average distance to the taurus star forming region ( sfr ) is reasonably well known , the actual distance to a given star in it is not .",
    "the taurus sfr extends for at least @xmath45 on the sky .",
    "if its depth is comparable to its width , the distance to a specific member may scatter by @xmath46 pc around the 140 pc mean , a relative error of @xmath47 .",
    "only cy tau and bp tau ( table 4 ) have a larger uncertainty of their mass measurement . for most of the stars in table 4 the uncertainty in their actual mass",
    "is therefore dominated by the uncertainty in their distance .",
    "the distance of course also determines the star s location in the hr diagram because @xmath48 .",
