    "e.g. , recent progress in vertically processed semiconductor nws with a cylindrically symmetric gate electrode , such as the wrapped insulator - gate field effect transistor@xcite , have shown great promise for application in future highly scaled electronic devices .",
    "besides the possibility of incorporating wrapped gates for improved gate control , nws offer other intriguing possibilities not easily accessible to planar designs , such as an inherent one - dimensionality as well as relaxed constraints in terms of combining highly lattice - mismatched materials along the nw channel due to radial relaxation of interface strain@xcite .    in order to facilitate the development of high performance nw electronic devices , it is important to accurately characterize the doping profile and interface properties of the system as well as further fundamental material parameters .",
    "si - based mos - stacks have long benefited from well developed capacitance - voltage ( cv ) measurement schemes for device characterization . however , similar methods have so far been largely unavailable for nw devices .",
    "recently cv characteristics of individual ge nws on sio@xmath0/si substrates were measured@xcite . here",
    "we are focusing on vertical wrapped gate nws for which we have earlier demonstrated a scalable processing protocol for routine cv spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "an overview of the device structure considered here is illustrated in fig .",
    "the device consists of an 11x11 array of inas nws , covered with a @xmath1 conformal @xmath2 dielectric layer and a top cr / au metalization as one of the capacitor electrodes .",
    "the capacitance is measured between this gate electrode and the core of the wire , which is connected via the substrate .",
    "details on the fabrication protocol and measurement techniques can be found elsewhere@xcite . in this paper",
    "we further develop the quantitative as well as qualitative understanding of these measurements , and also discuss various features of the cv - characteristics in detail .     and a cr / au gate . the lifting layer of polymer is inserted to reduce the capacitance between gate and substrate .",
    "the nanowires are modelled as cylinders where the radius of the inas will be referred to as @xmath3 , whereas @xmath4 is the radius of the inas and hfo@xmath0 together .",
    "typical measures are length @xmath5 nm , and radial dimensions @xmath6 nm , @xmath7 nm .    we assume that the unintentional doping of the nws is of n - type . by changing the applied gate voltage , @xmath8 , the charge within the nw , @xmath9 , can be affected .",
    "this defines the capacitance    @xmath10    the total charge @xmath9 is the spatial integral over the charge distribution @xmath11 containing three components @xmath12 inside the inas nanowire . here",
    ", @xmath13 is the positive elementary charge and @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the concentrations of ionized donors , electrons , and holes , respectively .",
    "the donors are assumed to be entirely ionized at room temperature as considered throughout this paper .",
    "all concentrations are assumed to depend only on the radial distance @xmath17 from the centre of the nw .",
    "this greatly facilitates the calculations as it reduces the problem to one dimension .",
    "working with homogenous doping profiles is motivated by averaging over arrays of long wires .",
    "however , microscopic fluctuations are neglected by this approach .",
    "the effective density of states masses for electrons and holes in inas are @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively@xcite .",
    "non - parabolicity effects are neglected albeit they can cause some quantitative deviations for large positive biases . for the determination of hole concentrations , we use the bandgap @xmath20ev for inas nws with wurtzite structure@xcite .",
    "the relative dielectric constant is @xmath21 both for the inas nw and the @xmath2 insulator @xcite .    to calculate the capacitance ,",
    "a poisson - schrdinger solver was implemented similar to the one demonstrated in @xcite . for a given charge distribution @xmath11 ,",
    "the cylindrical geometry permits the use of gauss law to solve poisson s equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath22 .",
    "thus , we obtain the hamiltonian @xmath23 together with the boundary condition for the wavefunction @xmath24 assuming that the @xmath25 layer constitutes an infinite barrier . due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem ,",

    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are the angular and radial quantum numbers , respectively .",

    "is then given by @xmath31 here the electrochemical potential @xmath32 was set to zero in the wire , which is used as a reference point throughout this paper .",

    "the electrons are depleted close to the surface of the wire ( depletion mode ) .",
    "in the simulation we assume that the insulating oxide layer is neutral of charge and use the corresponding electric potential @xmath39 at the gate as a parameter . however , trapped charges are likely to occur both at the surface of the wire and within the oxide@xcite .",
    "if an areal charge density @xmath40 is present at position @xmath41 the potential for @xmath42 is modified according to @xmath43 while @xmath22 is not affected for @xmath44 .",
    "experimentally , one measures the applied gate voltage @xmath8 which is related to the actual electric potential at the gate via @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the work function of cr and @xmath47 the electron affinity of the inas in the nanowire .",
    "as long as the trapped charges are unchanged they provide a constant bias offset @xmath48 between the measured bias and the parameter @xmath39 used in the simulation . as both the magnitude of the trapped charges and the electron affinity of inas in the wurtzite modification appearing in the nanowire",
    "are not a priori known , we use @xmath49 as a fit parameter in the subsequent data analysis .",
    "in fig .  [ fig3 ] the experimentally measured capacitance for the device with mean radius 27 nm is shown together with our calculations for different doping densities .",
    "the main trend is the increase of capacitance with bias .",
    "this can be attributed to the location of charges inside the nw . from gauss law",
    "it follows that the change in @xmath9 induced by a change in bias , will be larger if @xmath11 is affected at large values of @xmath17 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) ( corresponding to the operation point 1 in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , the charges are mainly located close to the nw surface in the accumulation region . in contrast , they are close to the centre of the wire at operation point 2 , see fig .",

    "this explains , why the capacitance is higher at point 1 than at point 2 .",
    "the measurements reported here are performed by adding a small ac - signal with a frequency of 20 mhz atop the dc gate - bias .",
    "the impedance is found to be almost completely imaginary showing a negligible influence of any series resistance to the accumulation capacitance . for positive bias",

    "in contrast , for @xmath51 the frequency dispersion is more pronounced , which we attribute to the presence of surface states , see sec .",
    "[ secsurfacestates ] .",
    "the green curve shows the measured capacitance when sweeping from positive to negative bias , while the yellow curve is for the opposite sweep direction .",

    "the calculations provide a capacitance per wire length , as given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . for the experimentally measured capacitance @xmath52 ,",
    "the gate substrate capacitance , which is independent of bias , see @xcite , has been subtracted and the result has been divided by an effective length @xmath53 , which has been taken as a second fit parameter in addition to @xmath49 . the data shown assumes an effective length corresponding to an effective number of 90 wires with the nominal length of 680 nm .",
    "this has to be compared with a total of 121 wires in the fabricated array .",
    "the difference can be attributed to lacking electrical connection of some wires and/or variations from the nominal length .",
    "each fabricated array showed a certain distribution of radii @xmath3@xcite . to accommodate for this ,",
    "an ensemble of three different values of @xmath3 was used in the simulation for each device , while the oxide thickness of 10 nm was held constant .",
    "the calculated curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] are the results from such ensembles with appropriate weights for each radius reflecting the measured radius distribution .",
    "+ @xmath54 + @xmath55 + @xmath56 + @xmath57    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is indicated that different factors , such as geometry , doping , surface states , and inversion ( holes ) , affect the capacitance at different gate voltages .",
    "we will in turn explain the contribution from each factor .",
    "measurements indicate that the down - sweep curve ( green curve ) is closer to equilibrium as time - dependent sweeps are more stable and the up - sweep ( yellow curve ) relaxes towards the down - sweep curve .",
    "therefore , all fits of our stationary model are made to the down - sweep curve .      according to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the capacitance is independent of the donor concentration in the accumulation mode , but rather depends on the geometry of the wire .",
    "the reason is that during accumulation electrons are added close to the semiconductor - oxide interface , see fig .",
    "thus different doping concentrations result in the same capacitance .",
    "the capacitance in this region can therefore not be used to determine the doping concentration .",
    "fitting to the experimental data instead determines the effective length of the wires .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the capacitance ( experimental down - sweep ) for nws with different radii @xmath3 are shown .",
    "all fabricated arrays have 121 nws , and the effective number of wires used for fitting @xmath53 is displayed in table [ tabscale ] . as a general trend ,",
    "the capacitance increases with the radius @xmath3 as there is a larger surface area of the nws .",
    "note that the capacitance in the accumulation region is significantly lower than the geometrical capacitance @xmath58 , which is @xmath59 f / nm for @xmath60 nm and @xmath61 nm .",
    "this deviation is strongly dependent on the density of states for the nanowire wire material , see sec .",

    ".effective number of wires and bias offset @xmath49 resulting in a best fit of the capacitance - bias characteristics for different arrays of nws and different assumed doping densities . [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      as the bias is lowered , the electrons will be depleted in the nw .",
    "a large doping concentration provides a positive background charge with a strong attraction for the electrons , requiring a higher negative gate voltage to deplete all the electrons .",
    "thus , the doping concentration strongly affects the slope of the capacitance curve around @xmath62 v. comparison between fits and experimental data shows that @xmath63@xmath64 is too flat while @xmath65@xmath64 is too steep .",
    "the doping of @xmath66@xmath64 fits very well up to the `` kink '' at point 2 of the experimental down - sweep curve in fig .",
    "this also holds for all devices shown in fig .",
    "as all devices were manufactured using the same method , this provides a consistent estimate of @xmath67@xmath64 for the doping density .",
    "the experimental curves exhibit a `` kink '' at point 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which is most clearly seen for the down - sweep curve . for biases below the kink the measured capacitance is significantly larger than the simulation result . in this section",
    "we attribute this to the emptying of surface states , situated at the semiconductor - oxide interface .",
    "the surface states are assumed to be located in the forbidden gap  @xcite , and are treated as donors  @xcite . as the states are located in the bandgap",
    ", they remain filled as long as @xmath35 is in the conduction band .",
    "theoretical evaluation of the potential at @xmath3 , for the doping of @xmath66@xmath64 , shows that @xmath35 is 0.1 - 0.2ev below the conduction band edge at the kink , see fig .",
    "[ fig2]c ) .",
    "this makes it feasible that the kink is an effect of such surface states . for gate voltages more negative than the one corresponding to the kink ,",
    "surface states are emptied which produces the discrepancy between simulations and experiment .",
    "while conduction band electrons as majority carriers can almost adiabatically follow the ac signal at 20 mhz , the filling and emptying of surface states is a slower process .",
    "therefore these states do not directly contribute to the capacitance under our measurement conditions . for lower ac frequencies ,",
    "we observe an enhancement of the capacitance in the bias region below the kink which we attribute to the direct contribution of surface states .",
    "the situation is however intricate due to a strong variation of charging times and its analysis is a matter of ongoing research .",
    "thus we focus on the high - frequency data at 20 mhz here .",
    "even if the surface states do not directly contribute to the capacitance signal , they affect the capacitance - voltage characteristics indirectly by the presence of a bias - dependent surface charge .",
    "this positive charge screens effectively the gate bias from the nw , so that a more negative @xmath68 is needed to deplete the electrons from the wire .",
    "this can be quantified using eqs .",
    "( [ eqphitrap],[eqvgate ] ) .",
    "an additional ( bias - dependent ) surface charge density @xmath69 at @xmath70 gives an additional shift of the gate bias @xmath71 with @xmath72 this explains the shift of the capacitance curve to lower bias while emptying the surface states . with @xmath73 being of the order of @xmath74 v ,",
    "positive surface charge densities of @xmath75 are observed for gate biases far in the depletion region .",
    "to summarize , if surface states are not included in the model , the simulations should be fitted to the part of the down - sweep curve right of the kink .",
    "the difference in @xmath68 between experiment and simulation below the kink allows for an estimate of the surface charge density .      as the electrochemical potential in the wire starts to approach the valence band",
    ", holes will appear .",
    "the creation and annihilation of holes are slow processes .",
    "the holes , like the surface states , will therefore not directly contribute to the capacitance at high frequencies but instead screen the electrons .",
    "the high effective mass of the holes imply a large density of states which results in a strong screening .",
    "if holes are created , practically no electrons will be removed any longer from the conduction band .",
    "the constant electron concentration causes the capacitance curve to flatten out at a finite value .",
    "this can be seen for the simulated doping @xmath63@xmath64 in fig .",
    "the lower doping concentrations are too small for inversion to start before the last electrons have been removed , and the capacitance goes to zero in agreement with the experimental data .    from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we see that inversion has an effect for the thicker wires also for @xmath66@xmath64 .",
    "this is in agreement with the measured capacitance which seems to flatten out at a finite value for negative bias rather than dropping to zero as for the thinner wires .    in this context",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the doping required for the coexistence of holes and electrons . for zero temperature",
    ", this situation corresponds to the electrochemical potential entering the valence band at @xmath76 before it leaves the conduction band at @xmath77 .",
    "thus , a certain doping concentration is required if the inversion should have any effect on the capacitance .",
    "this doping concentration can be classically estimated with help of gauss law @xmath78 the required doping as a function of @xmath3 can also be estimated with the poisson - schrdinger solver .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ figcoexist ] .        due to the confinement energy ,",
    "the prediction of the simulation is higher , than for the classical estimate .",
    "the difference is most significant for small @xmath3 . for large values of @xmath3",
    "the classical prediction is equal to , or even larger than the model prediction .",
    "the reason is that the full bandgap is used in eq .",
    "( [ eqcoestest ] ) .",
    "in contrast , due to the thermal distribution , holes are already occupied slightly before the electrochemical potential enters the valence band . from fig .",
    "[ figcoexist ] we conclude that at the estimated doping concentration @xmath66@xmath64 , inversion will not affect the capacitance for @xmath79 nm in accordance with the findings of fig .",
    "we will now show that equating the capacitance of a nw with its geometrical limit can lead to large overestimates . in fig .",
    "[ figmaterials ] the theoretically calculated capacitances of inas- , insb , gaas- and si - nw : s are plotted .",
    "the effective masses of these materials are 0.023 , 0.0145 , 0.063 and 0.33  @xcite respectively .",
    "( for si the density - of - state mass per conduction band valley was used and the valley degeneracy was explicitly taken into account for . ) they are all surrounded by hfo@xmath0 and have the same geometry , @xmath60 nm and @xmath61 nm , i.e they have the same geometrical limit . for comparison the results from a poisson - thomas - fermi solver",
    "have been plotted as well . in the thomas - fermi approximation ,",
    "the electron concentration at each point is determined by the distance between the conduction band edge and @xmath35 . multiplying the fermi - dirac distribution with the three - dimensional density of states and integrating over the conduction band yields the electron concentration as @xmath80 where the conduction band edge is given by the electrostatic potential times the electron charge @xmath81 .",
    "* again we use @xmath82 * as a reference .    due to the complex band structure of si",
    ", only the poisson - thomas - fermi results have been calculated for this material .",
    "the main difference between the two solvers is that classically the electron concentration does not have to be zero at the semiconductor - oxide interface , resulting in a higher capacitance .",
    "it is evident that the two models give the same results for a repulsive gate voltage . in this case the electron concentration approaches zero at @xmath3 as the potential surpasses the electrochemical potential , see also @xcite .",
    "f / nm , for @xmath8325 nm @xmath8435 nm @xmath85 /@xmath86 , plotted against the electrostatic potential at @xmath4 . ]    there is a reason why the geometrical capacitance can not be reached even classically .",
    "let us compare with a metallic coaxial cable . in this case",
    "the geometrical limit is reached as all charge is added at the surface .",
    "this requires an infinite density of states , which can not be found in a semiconductor , and thus the geometrical capacitance will not be reached .",
    "materials with a high effective mass , such as si , have a large density of states and will therefore come closer to the geometrical limit .    frequently , it is assumed that the capacitance is constant for large positive gate voltages .",
    "both experimental and theoretical results point out that this is not the case , the capacitance is slowly increasing with bias .",
    "as the gate becomes more attractive , electrons will be filled higher up in the conduction band .",
    "since the 3d density of states goes as @xmath87 , the density will increase as the bias is raised , resulting in a larger capacitance .",
    "it has been shown how information about the doping and surface state concentrations can be obtained for semiconductor nanowires by comparing experimental and simulated capacitance data .",
    "the above procedure suggests how the contribution from these two factors can be separated .",
    "analysis shows that the doping density @xmath88 gives good agreement with the experimental data . the surface state charge at full depletion is estimated to be around @xmath89 @xmath13 per @xmath90 .",
    "finally , the actual capacitance can be significantly smaller than its geometrical limit even in accumulation mode .",
    "the difference is of particular importance for nanowires with low effective mass .",
