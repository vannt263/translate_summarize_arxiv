    "broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars are a subset of quasars which exhibit strong absorption troughs from gas flowing outwards with velocities of thousands to tens of thousands of km  s@xmath0 ( e.g. , allen et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the traditional definition is that bal quasars are those which have civ  absorption which dips at least 10% below the continuum level for a contiguous stretch of at least 2000  km  s@xmath0  at blueshifts of @xmath33000  km  s@xmath0  relative to the quasar ( weymann et al .",
    "1991 ) . other proposed definitions ( hall et al . 2002 ; trump et al . 2006 ; gibson et al .",
    "2009 ) relax some of the conditions of the traditional definition to include more cases of potential intrinsic absorption with the tradeoff of increased contamination by blended narrow absorbers ( knigge et al .",
    "2008 ) whose origin(s ) , especially at low outflow velocities , may differ from those of bal outflows .",
    "bal quasars are often classified into three subtypes : high - ionization ( hibal ) , low - ionization ( lobal ) and iron lobal ( felobal ) .",
    "hibal quasars show absorption from only relatively high - ionization species such as civ  and nv .",
    "lobal quasars show high - ionization features plus absorption from low - ionization species such as mgii  and aliii .",
    "` iron lobal ' ( becker et al .",
    "1997 ) or ` felobal ' ( becker et al . 2000 ) quasars show high- and low - ionization troughs plus absorption from excited states of feii , feiii , or both .",
    "there is no commonly accepted definition for how broad or deep the mgii  or feii  absorption has to be for a quasar to be classified as a lobal or felobal quasar ( trump et al .",
    "2006 ; gibson et al .",
    "2009 ; zhang et al .",
    ". however , such troughs should at least be broader than intervening mgii  absorption systems , the vast majority of which have widths @xmath4500  km  s@xmath0  ( mshar et al .",
    "a minimum depth of 10% is appropriate for lobal and felobal troughs just as for hibal troughs , though in all cases this is not a physical limit but reflects the limitations imposed by spectral signal - to - noise ratios and our inability to model quasar continua exactly .",
    "bal troughs are often highly saturated , so that the trough depth is determined less by the gas column density and more by the covering fraction ; that is , the fraction of the continuum source occulted by the absorbing structure ( e.g. , arav et al .",
    "variability in bal trough strengths is relatively common ( see the exhaustive reference list in hall et al . 2007 , and gibson et al . 2008 ) but large ( @xmath250% ) changes in absorption equivalent width are rare ( crenshaw et al . 2000 ; lundgren et al . 2007 ;",

    "was first reported by gregg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , where it was misclassified as a star , and was first identified as a lobal quasar in white et al .",
    "hall et al . ( 2002 ) described it as a member of the class of ` overlapping - trough ' felobal quasars because its feii  absorption troughs are broad enough to overlap and yield almost no continuum windows below 2800 .",
    "however , the covering fraction of its feii  absorption was only @xmath675% at its discovery epoch , unlike some overlapping - trough objects which have @xmath795% covering fractions .",
    "fbqs j1408 + 3054  also likely has an fr  ii radio morphology ( gregg et al .",
    "2006 ) . in this work we present spectroscopy of fbqs j1408 + 3054 spanning nearly 8 years in its rest frame .",
    "the spectroscopic dataset shows mild variability followed by a dramatic decline in feii  and mgii  absorption strength (   [ data ] ) .",
    "substantial trough variability has previously been observed in the overlapping - trough felobal quasar sdss j043742.81@xmath8004517.6 ( hall et al .",

    "[ discuss ] we constrain the bal structure s size and transverse velocity and present a simple outflow model which we use to constrain the bal structure s location and age .",
    "we also discuss the implications of our observations for the average episodic lifetime of bal troughs in quasar spectra and for the link(s ) between bal subtypes and between bal troughs and fr  ii radio morphologies .",
    "we end with our conclusions in   [ con ] .",
    "spectroscopy was obtained using numerous telescope and instrument combinations ( table  1 ) , including the echellette spectrograph and imager ( esi ; sheinis et al .",
    "2002 ) at the keck telescope , the kast spectrograph on the lick observatory 3 m shane telescope ( miller & stone 1993 ) , and the low resolution spectrograph ( lrs ; hill et al . 1998 ) on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "data were obtained , reduced and calibrated using standard procedures ( gregg et al .",
    "1996 ; white et al . 2000 ; gregg et al . 2002 ) , except as we now discuss with regard to the het spectrum .",
    "we obtained a spectrum of fbqs j1408 + 3054  with the lrs on the het with the g2 grism ( useful observed wavelength coverage 4335 - 7155  ) and a 1@xmath9 slit .",
    "we obtained two spectrograms with a total exposure of 1510 seconds in 2@xmath9 seeing at an average airmass of 1.26 . a flux calibration star was not observed .",
    "we used the known throughput of the instrumental configuration to remove the instrumental response before correcting for interstellar and atmospheric extinction .",
    "when compared to the other normalized spectra shown in figure  1 , the normalized het spectrum exhibited a large - scale curvature resulting in a downturn in flux over several hundred observed   at both ends of the spectrum .",
    "we believe this curvature resulted from slit losses due to differential refraction . for the slit to include the quasar and a star bright enough to guide on",
    ", the long axis of the slit had to be oriented about 82@xmath10 from the parallactic angle , resulting in differential refraction of @xmath60.75@xmath9 over our wavelength range ( table  i of filippenko 1982 , hereafter f82 ) .",
    "inspection of the results of the two individual exposures obtained showed that one exposure yielded a more prominent downturn in its spectrum and also showed more flux from a third object slightly offset from the centre of the slit , suggesting that the quasar was not well centred in the slit in that exposure .",
    "we therefore dropped that exposure from consideration . to correct for slit losses in the remaining exposure",
    ", we assumed that the target was centred in the slit at a wavelength of 6500   .",
    "we computed the offset of the target along the narrow axis of the slit from 4000 - 7500    using table  i of f82 .",
    "we then used equation 8 of f82 to calculate the fraction of the flux captured by the slit as a function of wavelength and corrected the spectrum for those wavelength - dependent losses .",
    "the panels of figure  [ fig : rickwhitefig.eps ] show all of our spectra of fbqs j1408 + 3054  taken between 1995 and 2009 , normalized to an average of unity between observed 6000  and 7000 .",
    "the dashed vertical lines show the wavelengths of h@xmath1 and mgii  emission in the quasar rest frame .",
    "the dotted vertical lines show absorption from feii  @xmath112632 and mgii@xmath122796,2803  at the redshift of maximum absorption ( @xmath5=0.775 , a blueshift of 12,000 km  s@xmath0 from the quasar rest frame ) .",
    "blueward of feii  @xmath112632 , the spectra suffer overlapping absorption from hundreds of transitions of feii . a strong decrease in absorption strength occurred over the 955 rest - frame days between the two keck epochs ( mjds 51612 , in red , and 53377 , in cyan ) .",

    "the corrected het spectrum , taken 668 rest - frame days after the sdss epoch and shown in green in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : rickwhitefig.eps ] , reveals mgii  absorption even weaker than in the sdss epoch and a complete lack of feii  uv1 absorption .    figure  [ fig : zoom1408.ps ] displays our near - ultraviolet spectra of fbqs j1408 + 3054  from the period of weakening absorption .",

    "as in figure  [ fig : rickwhitefig.eps ] , the vertical dashed line shows the wavelength of mgii  in the quasar rest frame defined by the h@xmath1 line ( in the more recent spectra , the mgii  peak is blueshifted relative to the h@xmath1 rest frame ) and the rightmost vertical dotted line shows the wavelength of mgii  at the velocity of peak absorption , while the leftmost dotted line shows absorption at the same velocity from feii   @xmath112632 , the longest - wavelength component of the feii  uv1 multiplet ( moore 1950 ) .",
    "the left two light grey shaded regions show the wavelength ranges absorbed by feii  multiplets uv2+uv3 and uv1 at @xmath5=0.775 ; as expected , feii  @xmath112632 traces the long - wavelength edge of the uv1 absorption trough .",
    "absorption outside the shaded regions arises predominantly from hundreds of excited feii  transitions whose troughs overlap in velocity space .",
    "the dark grey shaded region shows the wavelength range spanned by mgii  absorption at velocities @xmath14=8700  km  s@xmath0  to @xmath14=14,200  km  s@xmath0 .",

    "the absorption at those wavelengths in the het spectrum can not be feii  uv62 because the feii  uv62 multiplet is intrinsically weaker than the uv1 multiplet and the latter is not present in the het spectrum . without detailed modeling",
    ", it is impossible to be sure that the feii  absorption spanned the same velocity range as mgii , but the shape of the mjd 51612 spectrum is consistent with feii  uv62 absorption also extending to 19,500  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : ewfig.eps ] shows the mgii  and blended mgii+feiiuv62 rest - frame equivalent widths @xmath15 for all spectra in figure  [ fig : rickwhitefig.eps ] .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured relative to a continuum established using the normalized sdss spectrum shown in figure  1 . in that spectrum , a linear continuum in @xmath16 vs. @xmath11 was drawn between the average fluxes at rest - frame 2550 - 2600    and 3765 - 3820   . in all spectra , mgii  @xmath15 values were measured between 2670 - 2720    and mgii+feiiuv62 @xmath15 values were measured between 2585 - 2720   . while there is some uncertainty in the actual continuum level and thus in the measured @xmath15 , the changes in @xmath15 in figure  [ fig : ewfig.eps ] are much larger than those uncertainties .",
    "as the mgii+feiiuv62 blend consists only of high - velocity mgii  in the het epoch , we conservatively estimate that the @xmath15 of mgii  had decreased by a factor of two by the het epoch",

    "the photographic magnitudes listed are the average of the usno - b1.0 ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) and gsc2.3.2 ( lasker et al . 2008 ) magnitudes whenever available and are typically uncertain by @xmath170.4 ( as compared to @xmath170.02 for sdss magnitudes ) .",
    "the conversions to sdss magnitudes were made using equation 2 of monet et al .",
    "( 2003 ) except for the palomar quick @xmath18 which used table 7 of smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . in five spectroscopic epochs ,",
    "the wavelength coverage was sufficient to enable synthesis of @xmath19 and @xmath20 colours using the sdss system response curves of doi et al . ( 2010 ) but slit losses prevented the synthesis of accurate magnitudes . only in the sdss spectroscopic epoch",
    "could both colours and magnitudes be reliably synthesized .",
    "corrections for galactic extinction have not been applied to these magnitudes .    despite the uncertainties in the magnitudes in table  2 ,",
    "the @xmath19 colours obtained from them provide good evidence that the @xmath21-band absorption in fbqs j1408 + 3054  was approximately constant in strength for at least 27 rest - frame years prior to its weakening sometime after mjd 51612 .",
    "however , we can not rule out the disappearance and reappearance of an feii  bal structure during that time , especially because there is a gap in the historical photometric record longer than twice the timescale over which the feii  absorption was later observed to vanish .    in the two sdss photometric epochs",
    ", there was an 18% increase in @xmath21-band flux relative to the @xmath22-band flux between mjd 53110 and 53795 ( 371 rest - frame days ) . assuming that flux increase was uniform across the @xmath21 band , we can predict that at mjd 53110 ( rest - frame day 1759 ) the mgii+feii  trough had @xmath23    and the mgii  trough @xmath24   .",
    "these points are plotted in figure  [ fig : ewfig.eps ] without error bars .",
    "they suggest that the change in @xmath15 values during the weakening of the bal troughs may have been more gradual than rapid , and perhaps not monotonic .",
    "to add to our picture of fbqs j1408 + 3054 , we also searched for additional data at other wavelengths ( figure  [ fig : galexfig.eps ] ) .",
    "we checked for sensitive x - ray coverage , but none is available .",

    "the flux decrement between the nuv and fuv filters is consistent with the expected strong absorption in the lyman transitions at the quasar redshift .",
    "the fuv non - detection on mjd 53523.5 is consistent with the fainter nuv flux at the same epoch .",
    "both galex observations occurred after the mjd 53377 keck spectrum which shows a strong reduction in feii  and mgii  absorption strength , so we can not determine if the absorption at observed nuv wavelengths has weakened like that at observed optical wavelengths has .",

    "then the transformation of fbqs j1408 + 3054  from an felobal to a lobal requires that some , but not necessarily all , lobal quasars must have the same distinct properties . in this scenario , the reason why some but not all lobal quasars have unusually high mid - ir luminosities as compared to hibal quasars has two underlying causes .",
    "first , at least some felobal quasars have such high mid - ir luminosities .",
    "second , some objects that are seen as lobal quasars along our line of sight could be classified as felobal quasars when seen along some lines of sight , while some lobal quasars would not be seen as felobal quasars along any line of sight .",

    "they could instead be quasars emerging from a shroud of gas and dust ( voit et al .",
    "1993 ) , for example as transition objects between ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and quasars ( farrah et al .",
    "2010 ) , or quasars with a specific disk wind geometry ( richards 2006 ) .",
    "our study of fbqs j1408 + 3054  does not provide support for the transition object scenario because the felobal gas in this object moves at very high velocities and is found only 1.7 to 14  pc from the black hole . if felobals are to be transition objects between ulirgs and quasars , they must drive out gas on kiloparsec and not just parsec scales .",

    "that work postulated that lobal quasars could be quasars emerging from parsec - scale shrouds of dusty gas , and our observations are entirely consistent with such a scenario .",
    "the existence of dusty gas on such small scales need not depend on the kiloparsec - scale structure of the quasar host galaxy , so felobal quasar host galaxies could be unremarkable in this model .    in the alternate scenario where felobals are quasars with specific disk wind geometries , they must be different from other quasars in at least one parameter driving accretion disk structure .",
    "for example , while the distribution of eddington ratios is known not to differ between non - bal and hibal quasars ( ganguly et al .",
    "2007 ) , the felobal quasar eddington ratio distribution has not been studied ; however , fbqs j1408 + 3054  has an unremarkable @xmath52 (   [ mbh ] ) .",

    "if variability of the sort seen in fbqs j1408 + 3054  is common , then we predict that quasars of one subtype which are more reddened than average for that subtype will be more likely to develop bal troughs of the next subtype .",

    ". future analyses of bal episodic lifetimes could relax these assumptions as well as consider bal episodes that overlap in time , whether at the same velocities or at different ones .    meanwhile , it is instructive to calculate the constraints obtained by considering the bals in fbqs j1408 + 3054 to have disappeared , even though the mgii  bal has not quite done so .",
    "those constraints are presented in the following paragraphs , along with more conservative constraints ( in parentheses ) obtained by considering fbqs j1408 + 3054 as a case of extreme bal variability , but not of bal disappearance .    of 13 lobals and felobals discovered in the first bright quasar survey ( becker et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ) and with later spectra from the sdss , only fbqs j1408 + 3054 shows dramatic changes in the absorption covering fraction and equivalent width .",
    "fbqs j1408 + 3054 is still the only such strongly variable bal quasar when the parent sample is expanded to include the 24 fbqs hibal quasars with later spectra from the sdss . using the binomial distribution , this result translates to a constraint of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) ; all limits and ranges given in this section are 90% confidence .",
    "we have also inspected 156 fbqs non - lobals with later spectral coverage of the mgii  region from the sdss .",
    "none of those quasars exhibited mgii  bals in their sdss spectra , yielding a constraint of @xmath91 .    using that combined @xmath66 , we constrain individual bal lifetimes to be @xmath92 years ( @xmath93 years ) , as compared to the gibson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) result of @xmath94 years .",
    "this range of lifetimes is broadly consistent with independently derived age limits on the bal structure in fbqs j1408 + 3054  (   [ multi ] and   [ tage ] ) , taking @xmath95 , the combined constraint on @xmath71 yields the constraint @xmath96 for @xmath97 years but no constraint ( @xmath98 ) for any @xmath99 years .",
    "no constraint on @xmath85 is possible if we consider fbqs j1408 + 3054 to be a case of extreme bal variability rather than of bal disappearance .",
    "note that placing a sufficiently strong upper limit on the episodic bal lifetime @xmath61 has the potential to place interesting constraints on @xmath85 .",
    "for example , suppose we have a constraint @xmath100 years from a @xmath101 measurement of 14 bal troughs in a sample of 300 disappearing over 3 years ( a rate within the current 90% confidence limits ) .",

    "if bals are seen to disappear more frequently than they appear , then maintaining a constant @xmath83 requires that a significant fraction of quasars enter the sample as bal quasars and that @xmath59 not be too large , so that eliminating one bal appearance per quasar has an appreciable impact . once upper limits are available for @xmath59 and @xmath61 , an upper limit to @xmath57 follows because the quasar lifetime can not be arbitrarily larger than @xmath109 while still maintaining the observed @xmath83 .",

    "fbqs j1408 + 3054  qualifies as a radio - loud fr  ii quasar if the radio sources identified as its fr  ii lobes are in fact associated with it , or as a radio - intermediate , core - dominated quasar if not ( gregg et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the weakening of the mgii  absorption in fbqs j1408 + 3054  slightly reduces the significance of the anticorrelation between bal strength ( as measured by the balnicity index ) and radio - loudness parameter @xmath110 for fr  ii bal quasars found by gregg .",
    "et al . ( 2006 ) .",
    "however , it remains true that fr  ii bal quasars define the upper envelope of that anticorrelation among all radio - selected bal quasars .",
    "the implications of the fr  ii - bal link for bal quasar variability depend on the reason(s ) for the fr  ii - bal link",

    "2003 ) . in any case",
    ", the transience and variability of bal outflows as a function of @xmath110 in this model would depend on the column density variations of the outflows as a function of @xmath110 .",
    "alternatively , what if the anticoincidence of bal winds and fr  ii radio morphologies occurs because the former tend to occur early in a quasar s lifetime and the latter can occur only when a bal shroud has been sufficiently reduced in column density by the quasar s radiation pressure ? in such an ` evolutionary ' model , quasars with larger lobe separations should on average be older and nearer the ends of their bal phases , resulting in greater transience and variability of bal outflows along a given sightline in such objects .",
    "observations of bal variability and transience as a function of lobe separation and @xmath110 are needed to test the evolutionary model and provide constraints any dynamical model of bal outflows must match .",
    "the quasar fbqs j1408 + 3054 was discovered as a spectacular felobal quasar , and historical data indicate it had been one for @xmath720 rest - frame years prior to its discovery , but it is now only a modestly absorbed lobal quasar .",
    "its feii  absorption outflowing at 12,000 km  s@xmath0 disappeared over a rest - frame time span of between 0.6 and 5 years , and its mgii  equivalent width decreased by a factor of two over the same time period .",
    "this variability was likely caused by a bal structure moving out of our line of sight to the ultraviolet continuum emitting region of the quasar s accretion disk , indicating a transverse velocity between 2600 km  s@xmath0 and 22,000 km  s@xmath0 .    in the context of a disk wind model , we connect the observed radial velocity and variability timescale of the feii  bal structure to its velocity vector and distance from the quasar .",
    "we have studied what constraints can be placed on those quantities given the unknown inclination of the accretion disk and the unknown angle between the wind velocity and the disk plane .",
    "we estimate that the bal structure which moved out of our line of sight in fbqs j1408 + 3054  is located between 5800  @xmath113 and 46,000  @xmath113 from the black hole and that the velocity vector of the wind is oriented at @xmath624@xmath10 to our sightline .    there could be other bal structures at different distances from fbqs j1408 + 3054 , but the close correspondence of the outflow velocity of mgii  with that of feii  strongly suggests that the mgii  absorbing structure is located at the same distance as that of feii .",
    "continued monitoring of fbqs j1408 + 3054  will be useful to constrain the size of the mgii  structure , should it too move out of our line of sight , and to constrain the time required for another feii  absorption structure to move into our line of sight .",
    "lastly , we have worked out in greater detail than heretofore how multiple - epoch spectroscopy of bal and non - bal quasars can be used to constrain the average lifetime of bal episodes , @xmath61 , and potentially the average number of bal episodes per quasar . at the moment , the 90% confidence limit on @xmath61 is @xmath260 rest - frame years .",
