    "irreversible adsorption of complex particles at solid and liquid interfaces is of a major significance for many fields such as medicine and material sciences as well as pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries .",
    "for example , adsorption of some proteins plays crucial role in blood coagulation , inflammatory response , fouling of contact lenses , plaque formation , ultrafiltration and membrane filtration units operation .",
    "additionally , controlled adsorption is fundamental for efficient chromatographic separation and purification , gel electrophoresis , filtration , as well as performance of bioreactors , biosensing and immunological assays .    since its introduction by feder @xcite , random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) became a well established method of adsorption properties modeling , especially for spherical molecules . on the other hand ,",
    "using rsa to simulate adsorption of more complicated particles , such as polymers or proteins , raises a question how the universal properties of rsa changes when it is applied to non - spherical molecules .",
    "the question has already been answered for basic shapes , e.g. spheroids , spherocylinders , rectangles , needles and similar @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies shows that such shapes are not sufficient for modeling adsorption of common proteins such as for example fibrinogen @xcite .",
    "therefore , attention of investigators has lately been drawn to to coarse - grained modeling of complex biomolecules and polymers @xcite .",
    "this study focuses on rsa of polymers on flat and homogeneous two dimensional collector surface .",
    "similar model has been investigated by adamczyk et al .",
    "@xcite ; the authors , however , have studied adsorption on squared grid . other works in this field used different polymers models e.g. @xcite or assumed specific conformations of polymers and used different simulation methods @xcite . in all of them ,",
    "authors have focused on proper modeling of a specific polymer and therefore numerical method used for adsorption modeling was treated only as a tool . here",
    "the main focus is set on properties of the tool .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to find out how the kinetics of rsa as well as basic characteristics of obtained adsorption monolayers depend on particle elongation and its number of degrees of freedom when the particle shape is approximated using coarse - grained approach . in our study , polymer is treated as a kind of a toy - model of complex molecule where both shape anisotropy and number of degrees of freedom are easy to control by merely changing the number of monomers . therefore the model seems to be the simplest , yet universal tool for determining properties of rsa as well as complex particles adsorption .",
    "polymer is modeled as a chain of identical , spherical monomers . in this study ,",
    "two kinds of polymer models are used :    i : :    stiff - monomers are placed along a straight line . in this model ,",
    "elongation is controlled by number of monomers , whereas number of    degrees of freedom remains constant ; ii : :    flexible - monomer can rotate freely around its neighbors , however , it    can not overlap with other monomers .",
    "it is assumed that all monomers    lays in a single plane .",
    "the number of degrees of freedom increases    with monomer count but the increase is non - linear , due to excluded    volume effect .",
    "maximal random coverages are generated using rsa algorithm , which is based on independent , repeated attempts of adding polymer to a covering layer .",
    "the numerical procedure is carried out in the following steps :    i : :    a virtual polymer is randomly created in such way that the center of    each monomer is located on a collector ; ii : :    an overlapping test is performed for previously adsorbed nearest    neighbors of the virtual polymer .",
    "the test checks if    surface - to - surface distance between monomers is not less than zero ; iii : :    if there is no overlap the virtual polymer is irreversibly adsorbed    and added to an existing covering layer .",
    "it s position does not change    during further calculations ; iiii : :    if there is an overlap the virtual polymer is removed and abandoned .",
    "attempts are repeated iteratively .",
    "their number is commonly expressed in dimensionless time units : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a number of attempts , @xmath2 denotes surface area of a single polymer projection on a collector , and @xmath3 is the collector area . here , @xmath4 for polymers build of @xmath5 spherical monomers of radius @xmath6 .",
    "square surface of @xmath7 with no boundary conditions .",
    "although , in general , specific boundary conditions can influence on obtained results it has been proved that in the case of dimer @xmath8 there is no such effect for large enough collectors @xcite .",
    "the total number of iterations in each simulation was @xmath9 .",
    "analyzed polymers were build of @xmath10 to @xmath11 monomers . for each polymer size and type @xmath12 independent numerical experiments",
    "have been performed .",
    "example layers obtained from numerical simulations described in sec.[sec : model ] are presented in fig.[fig : examples ] .     by flexible ( a ) ( b ) and stiff ( c ) ( d ) polymer rsa .",
    "the polymers are made of @xmath13 monomers ( a ) ( c ) and @xmath11 monomers ( b ) ( d ) .",
    "coverage ratios are : ( a ) - 0.489 , ( b ) - 0.356 , ( c ) - 0.464 , ( d ) - 0.345,width=302 ]    the main parameter characterizing obtained layers is coverage ratio : @xmath14 which , after infinite iteration of rsa algorithm , approaches the maximal random coverage ratio @xmath15 .",
    "parameter @xmath16 denotes here number of adsorbed polymers . to effectively measure @xmath17 using a finite - time computer simulations , appropriate model of adsorption kinetics",
    "is needed .",
    "adsorption kinetics can be described analytically for two cases : low coverage limit and jamming limit @xcite . in general , probability of adsorption",
    "depends on uncovered collector area described by available surface function ( asf ) .",
    "for example , when coverage is very low , asf decreases linearly with a number of adsorbed particles .",
    "when coverage increases the asf decay slows down as two or more particles can block the same space e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a low coverage limit the asf is often approximated by : @xmath18 where @xmath19 corresponds to an area blocked by single molecule and @xmath20 accounts overlapping of those areas @xcite .",
    "it is worth to notice that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are directly connected with viral coefficients , which can be also calculated from meyers diagrams , describing adsorbate particles in thermodynamic equilibrium . in case of stiff polymer",
    ", the particle shape can be approximated by a spherocylinder .",
    "then , @xmath21 can be analytically derived as @xcite : @xmath22 ^ 2}{4\\pi\\left[\\pi + 4(n-1)\\right ] } \\right\\ } , \\label{eq : c1sc}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is convex particle perimeter and @xmath24 is its area .",
    "though spherocylinder approximates surface blocked by adsorbed polymer particle properly , its area is slightly larger than the polymer model area .",
    "therefore , @xmath21 underestimates the real value and should be multiplied by a ratio of those areas : @xmath25 parameter @xmath20 can be obtained only numerically e.g. @xcite . in case of the flexible chain ,",
    "there are no analitical predictions for either @xmath19 or @xmath20 when @xmath26 .",
    "parameter @xmath19 has been numerically estimated by fitting @xmath27 defined as ( [ eq : asf ] ) for @xmath28 . for stiff polymer ,",
    "values obtained comply well with the predicted ( [ eq : c1 ] ) . for flexible one",
    ", @xmath19 grows with the number of monomers , which can be approximated with a power law ( see fig.[fig : c1 ] ) .     on polymer size .",
    "dots and squares are simulation data for flexible and stiff polymer , respectively , whereas lines corresponds to fits : ( [ eq : c1 ] ) for stiff polymer and @xmath29 for the flexible one.,width=302 ]    as expected , stiff polymer particle blocks more area than the flexible one .",
    "moreover , @xmath19 growth with polymer size is significantly faster for a linear particle .",
    "the second limit of rsa kinetics ( collector almost maximally filled ) is of major importance for determining maximal random coverage ratio basing on finite - time simulations .",
    "coverage growth is then governed by feder s law @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath24 is a coefficient and @xmath31 is interpreted as collector dimension @xcite in case of spherical particles adsorption or more generally as a number of degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "feder s law was confirmed for rsa of spheres in several collector dimensions @xcite , including non - integral @xcite , as well as for elongated particles @xcite .",
    "the analysis of exponent in ( [ eq : fl ] ) estimated using coverage ratio growth presented in fig.[fig : alpha ] reveals at least three things worth noticing .    ) on polymer size .",
    "dots and squares are simulation data , whereas lines corresponds to exponential fits : @xmath32)$ ] for stiff polymer and @xmath33)$ ] for the flexible one.,width=302 ]    first , the value for @xmath34 ( spheres ) is close to @xmath35 as predicted theoretically @xcite and confirmed in earlier studies e.g. @xcite .",
    "second , the value for dimer case ( @xmath36 ) is significantly higher , which reflects more degrees of freedom for such particles .",
    "this results differs from one obtained earlier @xcite .",
    "it results from less accurate approximation method used there .",
    "third , the stiff polymer exponent approaches @xmath37 for @xmath38 , which reflects third , orientational degree of freedom , and stays at this level despite further increase in monomers number . in the case of flexible polymer ,",
    "the increase is also curbed , but at higher @xmath39 value .",
    "it suggest that hard core interaction between monomers limits an infinite growth of the number of degrees of freedom with polymer length .",
    "the maximal random coverage ratios were determined by extending obtained rsa kinetics to infinite time . note that according to the eq.([eq : fl ] ) , set of point @xmath40 obtained from the numerical simulations will form a straight line . by approximating this line up to @xmath41",
    "one can find @xmath17 .",
    "note that the prior knowledge of exponent @xmath42 estimated in sec.[sec : kinetics ] is essential to get proper values of the maximal random coverage ratio .",
    "results obtained in this way are presented in fig.[fig : q_n ] .     for stiff polymer and @xmath43 for the flexible one.,width=302 ]",
    "the analysis of rsa of dimer shows , within error margin , the same maximal random coverage ratio for spheres as obtained for dimers @xcite .",
    "this , almost constant value of the ratio is observed in the range of @xmath44 , but only for flexible polymer model . then , rapid decay of coverage ratio is observed .",
    "the existence of the plateau is unexpected .",
    "similar study of rsa on a square lattice shows that the maximal random coverage ratio decreases exponentially with a polymer size @xcite .",
    "however , here on a continuous surface there are at least two competing factors affecting the maximal random coverage ratio .",
    "the first is similar as in the lattice case - larger particles are harder to place on a collector due to lower probability of finding a large enough uncovered space .",
    "the second factor is a highest packing ratio of monomers in a polymer globule than in a set of independent monomers .",
    "the second factor is more important for continuous collectors than for lattice one due to larger possibility of forming a globule , when it is needed .",
    "therefore , in the case of flexible polymer adsorption , competitions of those two factors results in almost constant coverage ratio up to @xmath44 . there is no such effect for stiff polymer , because there the second factor counts only for @xmath36 .",
    "the same reason explains much lower ( approx .",
    "20% ) values of the maximal random coverage ratio obtained for stiff polymer adsorption . in both the cases ,",
    "the decay of @xmath17 for large enough polymer length can be approximated by a power or exponential function . to fully discriminate between these two types of relationship the range of studied polymer lengths",
    "should be significantly extended .",
    "density autocorrelation function @xmath45 , also known as two - point correlation function , is defined here as a mean probability of finding two monomers at distance @xmath46 , regardless of whether they come from the same polymer chain or from different particles .",
    "because the density autocorrelation function depends on the coverage ratio , which is in general different for different polymer length and model , here we decide to calculate density for the coverage ratio close to the maximal one , but equal for all presented cases .",
    "such plot of the @xmath45 is presented in fig.[fig : g_r ] .     for flexible and stiff polymers",
    "were plotted together with data for spheres ( @xmath34 ) used here as a reference level .",
    "all functions were obtained for the same coverage ratio @xmath47 and were normalized to a mean density of monomers and , therefore , they oscillate around @xmath48.,width=302 ]    in case of spheres , the density autocorrelation function for maximal random coverages exhibits some universal properties , such as logarithmic singularity for @xmath49 @xcite and fast superexponential decay when @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "however , even for relatively short polymers , those properties can not be observed , due to periodic structure of particles ( especially in a stiff polymer ) . on the other hand , at distances larger than polymer length , almost no density correlation is observed .",
    "elongated particle can form orientationally ordered structures , e.g. liquid crystals . for rsa on infinite collector ,",
    "when particles orientations are randomly selected according to uniform probability distribution , there is no reason for the global orientational order to appear .",
    "nevertheless , forming of local ordered domains is possible @xcite because parallely aligned particles require less space ( see also fig.[fig : examples ] ) .",
    "therefore , subsequent adsorbed polymers will align parallel to their neighbors , especially when adsorption approaches jamming limit .",
    "situation changes when adsorption on finite collectors is investigated .",
    "adsorption conditions at collector boundaries may promote specific ordering .",
    "to measure it quantitatively the order parameter has to be defined @xcite .",
    "@xmath51,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a number of molecules in a layer , @xmath52 $ ] is a unit vector pointing from one end of the polymer to the other , and @xmath53 denotes mean direction of all particles and can be calculated as in @xcite .",
    "order parameter @xmath54 is normalized so as to vanish in totally disordered layers and to equal @xmath55 for perfectly ordered systems .",
    "the mean values of @xmath54 for obtained coverages are presented in fig.[fig : order_n ] .     for stiff polymer and @xmath56 for flexible one.,width=302 ]",
    "as expected , global orientational order increases with polymer size ; however , its value is rather small even for the longest stiff polymer because collector area is relatively large .    to study local ordering , the following function",
    "was introduced : @xmath57 ^ 2 \\rangle -\\frac{1}{2 }",
    "\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a unit vector along local orientational ordering at point @xmath59 and @xmath60 is an average over particle pairs at a distance @xmath46 , measured as a distance between centers of the closest monomers .",
    "relation @xmath61 shows how the local ordering propagates in a layer .        as shown in fig.[fig : q_r ] , ordering vanishes quickly for short stiff polymers .",
    "for the longest one , it is significantly larger than @xmath62 even at distance of @xmath63 , which reflects a tendency for parallel alignment .",
    "slight minimum around @xmath64 is connected with the definition of distance between particles , which allows two , even perpendicular polymers , to be as close as parallel ones .",
    "in the study , coarse - grain model of polymer is used to test dependence of rsa properties on number of degrees of freedom and elongation of adsorbate particles . rsa kinetics at low coverage limit",
    "is sensitive to molecule shape anisotropy whereas at jamming limit it is governed by number of degrees of freedom , which generally is consistent with feder s law predictions .",
    "maximal random coverage ratios did not change for short ( @xmath65 ) flexible polymers , while rapid drop was observed for stiff polymer starting at @xmath66 .",
    "density autocorrelations for maximally covered layers reflect the inner structure of adsorbate particles , especially for stiff polymers .",
    "additionally , in that case , significant local orientational ordering was observed , which reflects domain structure of such layer .",
    "flexible and stiff polymer models discussed here , are only two extreme possible cases .",
    "in fact , polymer stiffness is controlled by an intra - molecular interactions , which typically depends on an environmental conditions .",
    "it is possible to extend presented model of polymer by such interactions and find dependence of properties discussed here on for example temperature in a way as in @xcite , where similar rsa problem on a square and triangular lattice has been studied .",
