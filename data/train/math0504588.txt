    "its _ degree _ is the number @xmath5 such that @xmath2 looks like @xmath6 in the neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "a _ critical value _ of @xmath2 is its value at a critical point .",
    "( note that we do not count poles as critical points . )    a rational function @xmath2 is called _ simple _ if every critical value of @xmath2 has exactly one critical preimage .",
    "it is called _ almost polynomial _ if the sum of orders of its poles is smaller than the degree of each critical point .",
    "thus an almost polynomial rational function has a numerator of a much bigger degree than the denominator .",
    "our goal is to find the number of simple almost polynomial rational functions with fixed orders of poles and fixed critical values of fixed degrees , a problem first considered by v.  arnold  @xcite .",
    "the general problem of enumerating ramified coverings of the sphere with fixed ramification types can , in some sense , be solved using the representation theory of the symmetric group ; however the answer one obtains is a rather complicated sum over the irreducible representations . in purticular",
    ", there is still no simple criterion allowing one to determine whether the number of coverings is equal to @xmath7 or not .    for ( not necessarily simple ) polynomials",
    "the problem can be reduced to a combinatorial problem solved by i.  p.  goulden , d.  m.  jackson in  @xcite .",
    "later , when the relation to polynomials was discovered , their formula was reproved in @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite ( appendix by d.  zagier ) by three different methods . in  @xcite",
    "we also treated the case of almost polynomial functions with just one simple pole .",
    "in all these cases , as well as in the case considered in the present note , one obtains simple closed answers .",
    "a.  goupil and g.  schaeffer  @xcite generalized goulden and jackson s result on polynomials to meromorphic functions with a unique pole on riemann surfaces of any genus , but their answer is not as explicit . for other results on the enumeration of ramified coverings and their relation to the intersection theory on moduli spaces",
    "see  @xcite , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "all rational functions we consider in the sequel are simple and almost polynomial .",
    "a rational function @xmath2 can be viewed as a ramified covering of the riemann sphere by the riemann sphere .",
    "going around a critical value in the image we obtain a permutation of the sheets in the preimage ( the monodromy of the covering ) .",
    "it follows from riemann s existence theorem that the problem of counting rational functions can be reformulated in terms of permutations ( for details see  @xcite , chapter  2 ) .",
    "let @xmath8 be a permutation of @xmath9 elements .",
    "a product @xmath10 is called a _ minimal factorization _ of @xmath11 if ( i )  the group generated by @xmath12 acts transitively on the set @xmath13 and ( ii )  the total number of cycles in the permutations @xmath14 equals @xmath15",
    ".    here @xmath11 corresponds to the monodromy of @xmath2 at @xmath16 , while the @xmath17 s are the monodromies at the critical values .",
    "the conditions guarantee that the ramified covering determined by the permutations @xmath14 is ( i )  connected and ( ii )  of genus  @xmath7 ( by the riemann - hurwitz formula ) . rather than counting the cycles of the permutations ,",
    "it is more natural to consider their _ defects _ : a defect being @xmath18 .",
    "if the euler characteristic of the covering surface equals @xmath19 , the sum of defects of the corresponding monodromies equals @xmath20 .",
    "hence the total defect @xmath21 of a minimal factorization is the smallest possible for a transitive factorization , which explains the word `` minimal '' .    for shortness , we will say that _ a rational function @xmath2 is of type _",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 if it has @xmath24 poles of orders @xmath25 and @xmath26 critical points of degrees @xmath27 .",
    "( the sum @xmath28 satisfies @xmath29 for all  @xmath30 . ) similarly , we say that _ a minimal factorization is of type _",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 if @xmath11 has cycles of lengths @xmath31 , while each @xmath17 is an @xmath32-cycle , i.e. , has exactly one cycle of length @xmath32 the other points being fixed .    to a minimal factorization of type @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath23 we can assign a colored graph with oriented edges called a _",
    "constellation_. it is obtained in the following way .",
    "take @xmath1 numbered vertices .",
    "for each @xmath30 , @xmath33 form an oriented polygon using the vertices from the cycle of @xmath17 .",
    "the edges of the polygon are colored in `` color '' @xmath30 .",
    "now forget the numbers of the vertices .",
    "it is clear that the constellation allows one to reconstitute the permutations @xmath14 up to a common conjugation .",
    "[ def : constellation ] a _ constellation _ is a connected graph whose edges are oriented and colored in colors from @xmath34 to @xmath26 , obtained by gluing together @xmath26 oriented polygons with colors @xmath35 at some of their vertices .",
    "a vertex of a polygon can not be glued to another vertex of the same polygon .    to sum up , we now have three equivalent problems : given @xmath22 , @xmath23 , count the number of rational functions , or of minimal factorizations , or of constellations of this type .",
    "the three numbers differ by simple combinatorial factors .",
    "we will need some more remarks on constellations .",
    "a constellation coming from a minimal factorization has a natural embedding into a sphere ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is given by the following conditions : ( i )  the orientations of the edges determine the counterclockwise orientation on each polygon ; ( ii )  if we choose any vertex and enumerate the colors of the polygons surrounding it in the counterclockwise order starting from the smallest color we obtain an increasing sequence of colors .",
    "cutting the sphere along the edges of the embedded constellation we obtain @xmath36 pieces homeomorphic to open discs . among them , @xmath26 correspond to the polygons and the @xmath37 others to the cycles of @xmath11 .",
    "the piece corresponding to the long cycle ( of length @xmath38 ) will be called the _ exterior face _ ; the other @xmath24 pieces will be called _",
    "interior faces _ or just _ faces_. note that not all vertices of a face are contained in the corresponding cycle of @xmath11 . those which are will be called the _ essential vertices _ , see figure  [ fig : faces ] .",
    "from now on we will always assume that the constellations are embedded into a sphere .",
    "note that the somewhat bizarre condition @xmath29 has a simple interpretation for constellations : it means that every polygon must have at least one edge on the exterior face .",
    "however the algebraic meaning of this condition remains mysterious .",
    "let @xmath25 be @xmath39 positive integers ( orders of poles ) , @xmath40 .",
    "fix an integer @xmath41 ( degree of the almost polynomial ) .",
    "let @xmath42 be @xmath43 more positive integers ( multiplicities of the critical points ) satisfying @xmath44 for all @xmath30 and @xmath45 ( the riemann - hurwitz formula ) . denote by @xmath46 the number of permutations @xmath47 of @xmath24 elements such that @xmath48 for all @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , @xmath50 .    consider a permutation @xmath8 with cycle type @xmath51 .",
    "[ thm : main ] the number of minimal factorizations of @xmath11 into @xmath32-cycles equals @xmath52 the number of constellations as well as the number of rational functions with fixed critical values of type @xmath22 , @xmath23 equals @xmath53    the three assertions of the theorem are equivalent . indeed , the number of constellations and the number of rational functions of a given type coincide , which follows from riemann s existence theorem ( see  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "on the other hand , to obtain a minimal factorization of @xmath11 from a given constellation , we must number the vertices of the constellation in such a way that the product @xmath54 equals @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are @xmath55 ways to do that .",
    "( this number is also the number of permutations that commute with @xmath11 . )    in the next two sections we prove the theorem for constellations .",
    "we are going to prove the assertion of the theorem on the number of constellations .",
    "we start by labeling the faces of the constellations so as to make them distinguishable , which kills the @xmath56 factor .",
    "we must show that the number of such constellations with labeled faces equals @xmath57    we proceed by induction on the number @xmath24 of faces in the constellations .    for @xmath58 ,",
    "the constellations have no ( interior ) faces , i.e. , they are `` trees '' glued of a given set of polygons .",
    "such constellations ( also called `` cacti '' ) were enumerated in  @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "the answer one obtains is @xmath59 .",
    "suppose the formula is established for constellations with @xmath60 faces and let us add one more face .",
    "polygon _ of the constellation is a _ neighbor _ of the @xmath61st face if it has at least one edge in common with this face .",
    "a _ face _ of the constellation is a _ neighbor _ of the @xmath61st face if its bounding polygons are all neighbors of this face .",
    "the @xmath61st face can have any number @xmath62 of neighboring polygons and any number @xmath63 of neighboring faces as in figure  [ fig : neighbors ] .",
    "( note that a polygon that has only one vertex in common with the face is not considered a neighbor . )",
    "the condition @xmath29 implies that each neighboring face is bounded by exactly two polygons .    to construct a constellation with @xmath37 faces we must make the following choices .    *",
    "*  choose the numbers @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "* 2 . *  choose @xmath64 polygons among @xmath26 and @xmath65 faces among @xmath24 to be the neighbors of the @xmath61st face .",
    "this gives @xmath66 choices .",
    "denote by @xmath67 the set of the @xmath65 neighboring faces .",
    "form the @xmath61st face using the @xmath64 chosen polygons .",
    "this is done in the following way .",
    "denote the essential vertices of the face by @xmath68 .",
    "we must describe the colors and the order of the edges that will form the intervals between @xmath69 and @xmath70 for each @xmath49 .",
    "we claim that such a disposition of edges is uniquely determined once we have ( arbitrarily ) assigned to each of the @xmath64 polygons the interval @xmath71 where its first edge will appear ( as we go around the face in the clockwise direction ) .",
    "indeed , the disposition of the edges can be obtained as follows .",
    "( a )  for each polygon assigned to the interval @xmath71 take one edge of its color .",
    "( b )  order these edges in the increasing order of colors .",
    "( c )  in the case if either the biggest color used in @xmath72 is smaller than the smallest color in the list for @xmath71 or if there are no polygons assigned to @xmath71 , add , at the beginning of the list of colors for @xmath71 , the last color used in @xmath73 .",
    "an example of this algorithm is shown in figure  [ fig : formface ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the vertices @xmath69 are indeed the essential vertices and that this is the unique way to achieve this .",
    "thus the number of ways to form the @xmath61st face using @xmath64 given polygons is @xmath74 .",
    "*  now we must choose the positions of the @xmath65 faces that were chosen to be the neighbors of the @xmath61st face .",
    "there are @xmath64 `` clefts '' between the polygons where these faces can be placed .",
    "several faces can appear in the same cleft . in this case",
    "they must be ordered ( starting from the face closest to the @xmath61st one ) .",
    "thus there are @xmath75 ways to choose the positions of the faces .",
    "*  each of the neighboring faces has exactly two bounding polygons .",
    "we now choose how many edges of the face will belong to the polygon , say , on its left .",
    "for the @xmath49th face there are @xmath76 choices .",
    "thus we obtain a factor @xmath77 this product , of course , depends on the particular choice of the @xmath65 neighboring faces .",
    "however we will soon see that the remaining part of the formula contains the complementary product @xmath78 and thus it is not necessary to take a sum over all possible choices .",
    "*  we have assembled together all the polygons and faces that are neighbors of the @xmath61st face .",
    "they form a subconstellation @xmath79 of the total constellation .",
    "now we are going to _ consider @xmath79 as a unique polygon_. indeed , we are going to show that the remaining polygons are attached to @xmath79 in the same way as they would be attached to a unique polygon .",
    "in particular , the number of ways to attach them is the same .",
    "this will allow us to procede by induction .    denote by @xmath80 the sum of lengths of the faces of @xmath79 and by @xmath81 the total number of vertices of @xmath79 .",
    "these @xmath81 vertices are acted upon by @xmath64 cyclic permutation corresponding to the polygons .",
    "the product of these @xmath64 permutations splits the vertices into @xmath82 cycles of lengths @xmath76 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "the vertices of the last cycle will be called the _ essential exterior vertices _ of @xmath79 .",
    "now consider a constellation @xmath86 formed by the @xmath87 polygons not used in @xmath79 and , in addition , one @xmath88-gon of color @xmath7 .",
    "suppose that the faces of @xmath86 have lengths @xmath76 , @xmath89 .",
    "we are going to replace the @xmath88-gon in @xmath86 by the constellation @xmath79 .",
    "let @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "*  first we establish a one - to - one correspondence between the vertices of the @xmath88-gon and the essential exterior vertices of @xmath79 preserving their cyclic order .",
    "there are @xmath85 ways of doing that , which will account for a factor @xmath85 in the final formula .    in principle , the number @xmath85 is different for different choices of the @xmath64 polygons and the @xmath65 faces .",
    "however we will soon see that this number appears in the total sum only as a linear factor .",
    "therefore it will be a posteriori justified to replace it by its average over the possible choices of @xmath64 polygons and @xmath65 faces .",
    "the average value @xmath92 of @xmath85 equals @xmath93 indeed , the total number of edges in the @xmath26 polygons equals @xmath94 by the euler formula . choosing randomly @xmath64 of the @xmath26 polygons we obtain an average of @xmath95 edges in the subconstellation @xmath79 .",
    "since @xmath79 has @xmath96 faces and @xmath64 polygons , its average number of vertices is @xmath97 , again by the euler formula .",
    "now , @xmath79 has @xmath96 faces , one of which is always of length @xmath84 and the other @xmath65 are chosen randomly from @xmath24 possibilities .",
    "thus @xmath98 , whence we obtain @xmath92 .    * 8 .",
    "*  let us go around the exterior face of the constellation @xmath79 in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "the colors of the edges we meet will be increasing in each interval between two consecutive essential exterior vertices .",
    "then , as we pass an essential vertex , the number of the color jumps down .",
    "suppose we are given a new polygon of some color @xmath30 that does not appear in the constellation @xmath79 .",
    "we want to attach this polygon to the exterior of @xmath79 in such a way that the cyclic order of colors around each vertex remains increasing ( see the remarks after definition  [ def : constellation ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that in each interval between two consecutive essential vertices @xmath69 ( included ) and @xmath70 ( excluded ) there is a unique vertex to which the polygon can be attached .",
    "now , the essential exterior vertices of @xmath79 are in a one - to - one correspondence with the vertices of a @xmath88-gon in the new constellation @xmath86 .",
    "we want to replace the @xmath88-gon in @xmath86 by the subconstellation @xmath79 . to do that , for each polygon @xmath30 attached to some vertex of the @xmath88-gon , we take the corresponding essential exterior vertex @xmath69 of @xmath79 and attach our polygon to the unique possible vertex between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    it is easy to see that the faces of @xmath86 , even those that have been modified by our operation , will still have the same number of essential vertices as before .",
    "thus there is a unique way to substitute the @xmath88-gon in @xmath86 by the subconstellation @xmath79 .",
    "the result is the constellation we were trying to assemble .",
    "it remains to choose the constellation @xmath86 . by the induction assumption , there are @xmath99 choices .",
    "indeed , the constellation @xmath86 has @xmath87 polygons , @xmath100 ( interior ) faces of lengths @xmath76 , @xmath89 , and the length of its exterior face is @xmath38 ( the same as in the constellation that we are assembling ) .",
    "the result of our investigation is that the number of constellations ( with labeled faces ) is given by the following sum :          substituting this into the initial sum we obtain @xmath109.\\ ] ] this sum can now be evaluated using two more elementary identities @xmath110\\ ] ] @xmath111 with @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
