    "<S> 103 , 246804 ( 2009 ) ) in their experimental work observed recently that hydrogen intercalation of sic - graphene samples can recover electronic properties typical to selfstanding graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the possible scenarios of hydrogen intercalation inducing graphene layer decoupling , including both the hydrogen penetration paths and energetically stable positions of hydrogen atoms , were modeled in _ ab initio _ dft calculations . from the obtained results it follows that , due to intercalation , the graphene layer moves away to achieve about 3.9   distance from the sic surface . </S>",
    "<S> electronic band structure , calculated for such quasi free standing graphene , exhibits dirac - cone behavior which is in agreement with arpes measurements .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene is the one of the most interesting topic in recent decades . </S>",
    "<S> it is because of its outstanding electronic properties such as massless dirac fermions , large electron coherence lengths , anomalous integer hall effect @xcite , ballistic transport at room temperature , and good capability of integration with the silicon planar technology . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , graphene is also promising material for wide range of applications , such as high speed electronics , detection of some species , etc . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> selfstanding graphene is not stable mechanically , therefore very promising route was found when it was discovered that growth of graphene on sic substrate is relatively simple . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that graphene growth on sic surface is possible on both si and c - faces . </S>",
    "<S> high quality graphene layers on sic(@xmath0 ) , i.e on si - face side are smooth and homogeneous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> possibility of fabrication of large area epitaxial graphene and its integration with existing device technologies drawn attention of many researchers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the first graphene layer formed on sic(@xmath0 ) surface consists of @xmath1 and @xmath2 hybridized carbon atoms @xcite , therefore first graphene layer is covalently bound to sic(@xmath0 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> this drastically lowers the mobility of carriers which does not exceed 2.000 @xmath3 at low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies are consistent . </S>",
    "<S> they show that graphene - sic(@xmath0 ) surface distance is about 2  . </S>",
    "<S> _ ab initio _ studies indicate that the first carbon layer is a buffer layer and there are no dirac cones in its band structure . </S>",
    "<S> this explains low carrier mobility , measured experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent experimental work show that electronic properties typical for graphene can be recovered after hydrogen intercalation of graphene single layer , deposited on sic(@xmath0 ) surface . </S>",
    "<S> riedl et . </S>",
    "<S> al . in their work </S>",
    "<S> @xcite prepared epitaxial graphene on 4h - sic(@xmath0 ) surface . from these samples </S>",
    "<S> , they were able to obtain quasi - free - standing epitaxial graphene after annealing in molecular hydrogen at atmospheric pressure at the temperature between @xmath4c and @xmath5c . </S>",
    "<S> inspired by their results we have modeled possible hydrogen intercalation scenarios and penetration paths of hydrogen atoms .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we employ _ ab initio _ density functional theory to investigate graphene - sic interface . in all </S>",
    "<S> reported calculations vasp @xcite code was employed . </S>",
    "<S> the projector augmented wave ( paw ) approach @xcite was used in its variant available in the vasp package @xcite . for the exchange - correlation functional local spin density approximation ( lsda ) was applied . </S>",
    "<S> a plane wave cutoff energy was set to 500 ev . </S>",
    "<S> monkhorst - pack k - point mesh was set to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> 4h - sic(0001 ) superlattice was constructed using 8 bilayers of si - c , which sufficiently well approximates the properties of real surface . at the top of the sic structure </S>",
    "<S> one carbon atomic layer was placed . </S>",
    "<S> the slab separation space width was varied , depending on the considered case ( with or without hydrogen ) , between 26.8 and 28.5   . due to the lattice mismatch between sic and graphite </S>",
    "<S> we have performed elastic adjustment at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> two top sic layers and graphene layer was relaxed . </S>",
    "<S> conjugate gradient algorithm was used in the relaxation of the atomic positions .    </S>",
    "<S> we have used the model proposed by mattausch and pankratov e.g. @xmath7 unit cell with fitted graphene layer ( gl ) . in this case gl </S>",
    "<S> is covalently bonded to the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> covalent bonds overcompensates the elastic stress at the interface . </S>",
    "<S> previous works showed that covalent bonding of the substrate removes the graphene - type electronic features from the energy region around the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> after relaxation the bond length between sic surface and gl was about 2   which is in agreement with earlier theoretical and experimental works . </S>",
    "<S> in this model only two of the three topmost si atoms are covalently bound to the graphene layer , one si atom remains unbounded .    </S>",
    "<S> subsequently the system with the hydrogen molecule positioned under the graphene layer , was simulated . </S>",
    "<S> it turned out that relaxation pattern is as follows : one hydrogen atom from h@xmath8 molecule is detached and subsequently it is attached to the free - standing top si atom . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining one breaks the sic - graphene bond . in the result , </S>",
    "<S> the graphene layer is decoupled from the surface , it moves away to the distance of 3.7   from the sic surface ( see . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hydro ] b ) . the graphene layer in this configuration in not covalently bound to the surface but it is quasi free standing over sic surface . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hydro ] c presents the situation in which the gl and sic surface is separated by hydrogen atoms which are breaking covalent si - graphene bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the most stable position of hydrogen atoms is perpendicular to the sic surface . in this model graphene layer </S>",
    "<S> is about 3.9   above the surface . despite the distance </S>",
    "<S> , the graphene monolayer still weakly interacts with the surface . </S>",
    "<S> riedl et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite observed that leed patterns were suppressed after hydrogen treatment which indicates much smaller displacements in graphene layer . </S>",
    "<S> comparing situations presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hydro ] a , b and c we note that in b and c case graphene layer is almost flat , which is in contrast with the a case where the covalently bonded atoms are shifted towards the surface .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of electron density profiles can give further insight into nature of intercalation process . </S>",
    "<S> charge density maps ( see . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : chgcar ] ) show that in the case of graphene covalently bound to the surface graphene atoms are strongly affected by the sic substrate and are now in two configurations - @xmath1 ( not bound to the surface ) and @xmath2 ( bound to the surface ) . </S>",
    "<S> situation is quite different after hydrogen treatment . in this case </S>",
    "<S> each graphene atom , as in isolated graphene layer , has @xmath1 configuration .    </S>",
    "<S> resulting band structures of covalently bound graphene on sic(@xmath0 ) surface and quasi free standing graphene are compared in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : band ] . eigenvalues associated with graphene layer are marked with circles . </S>",
    "<S> band gaps are underestimated which is well known systematic lsda error . as described by mattausch et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the graphene electron spectrum is drastically changed by covalent bonding . </S>",
    "<S> graphene dirac cones are merged into the valence band , as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : band ] - top . in the proposed scenarios the hydrogen intercalation breaks the covalent bonding , leading to recovery of characteristic graphene dispersion cone , </S>",
    "<S> see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : band ] - bottom .    </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with arpes measurements performed by riedl et al . showing that after hydrogen treatment @xmath9 graphene bands ( dirac cones ) appear </S>",
    "<S> fermi level in this case intersects the dirac cone . </S>",
    "<S> agreement of theoretical ( structure , electronic properties ) and experimental results ( leed and arpes patterns ) suggests that the proposed intercalation scenario is correct . </S>",
    "<S> this model was previously proposed by mattausch and pankratov , but there was not as strong ( considering situation before and after hydrogen treatment ) evidence proving that it is correct .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , riedl et al . pointed out that the hydrogen intercalated samples are extremely stable in ambient atmosphere , at least for several months . </S>",
    "<S> this is also very well explained by our model . </S>",
    "<S> binding energies obtained from presented calculations demonstrate that configuration with hydrogen atoms bound to the si surface atoms and the graphene layer decoupled is more energetically favorable than coupled graphene - sic(@xmath0 ) and isolated hydrogen molecule . </S>",
    "<S> that explains high durability and stability of the samples .    </S>",
    "<S> the question , left unanswerd by riedl et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is related to the path by which the hydrogen penetrates the graphene layer to arrive at si surface atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed scenarios include hydrogen migration through graphene lattice or intercalation starting at grain boundaries on the surface .    in order to shed more light on the scenario of direct hydrogen penetration of the graphene lattice </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed another series of calculations . </S>",
    "<S> hydrogen molecule was dragged through the graphene layer . </S>",
    "<S> hydrogen was positioned in the center of graphene hexagon perpendicular to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> we have compared two cases of hydrogen adsorbed either on isolated graphene layer or on graphene on sic(@xmath0 ) surface . in the second case hydrogen atom was placed over si - sic(@xmath0 ) surface dangling bond ( see . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : h2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> energy in function of the distance between center of hydrogen molecule and the graphene layer was presented on fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : h2 ] . in the separate graphene layer case , </S>",
    "<S> the energy rapidly increases while hydrogen is moving closer with the resulting energy barrier of about 7 ev . </S>",
    "<S> in fact sic surface weakly affects the energy profile , reducing the energy barrier to about 6.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> in these two cases , the energy barrier is to high to overcome .    </S>",
    "<S> second possibility is that hydrogen intercalation occurs at grain boundaries on the surface . </S>",
    "<S> to consider this situation we put hydrogen molecule between sic(@xmath0 ) and graphene layer . </S>",
    "<S> relaxation process proceeded in two steps ( see . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dec ] ) . in the first hydrogen molecule decomposes and one of hydrogen atom is bound to the dangling bond . in the second step </S>",
    "<S> free hydrogen atom breaks graphene - sic(@xmath0 ) covalent bond and is bound to si atom . </S>",
    "<S> graphene layer is decoupled from the surface as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : hydro ] and hydrogen atoms line up perpendicularly to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> this result shows that it is a possible path of penetrating graphene - sic(@xmath0 ) surface system .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , it was shown that the graphene structure is detached from sic(@xmath0 ) surface by intercalated hydrogen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> presented results indicate that after hydrogen treatment , the graphene properties are recovered ( dirac cone appears in band structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the calculations were compared with experimental results @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference of the surface configuration before and after hydrogen treatment is in accordance with with the experimental ( leed , arpes ) results . </S>",
    "<S> this compatibility indicates that the used model is correct and accurately describes the real structure . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have shown stable graphene - sic structure penetrated by hydrogen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we have also considered possible scenarios of hydrogen intercalation - penetration through graphene lattice and through grain boundaries . presented results </S>",
    "<S> indicate that moving through graphene lattice is rather impossible . </S>",
    "<S> more probable situation is diffusion through grain boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> it should be also stressed that graphene layer decoupled from sic by hydrogen is more energetically favorable than isolated graphene - sic system and hydrogen molecule and that intercalation does not destroy the graphene structure . </S>",
    "<S> these results explain why such system is extremely stable and that intercalation procedure can be repeated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the intercalation process can recover graphene remarkable electronic properties it can be used to obtain homogeneous and large epitaxial graphene layers on sic(@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is very promising feature which can be used in fabrication of nanoelectronic devices . </S>"
