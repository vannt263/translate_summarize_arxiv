    "gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) are intense flashes of radiation that appear at unpredictable times from random locations on the celestial sphere .",
    "they have been studied since their serendipitous discovery by the _ vela _ satellite network @xcite .",
    "despite nearly 40 years of research , the progenitors of these astrophysical phenomena remain largely unknown .",
    "several thousand of these events have been detected by many different instruments .",
    "the bulk of the energy emission of grbs occurs in the x  ray and gamma  ray regime of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "their intensities and durations span many orders of magnitude , where the intensity of a burst is usually defined by its peak flux at a specified time resolution and in a specified energy range .",
    "the strong bursts are distributed homogeneously in space as the angular distribution is consistent with an isotropic distribution @xcite .",
    "observations of burst afterglow at other wavelengths may provide substantial evidence of the burst mechanism .",
    "research in this area involves attempting to determine the celestial locations of bright bursts while they are in progress and to distribute these to observers for rapid follow - up observations at other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this afterglow search has yielded several observations of grb afterglows ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the count rate time history of each grbs is unique , rendering classifications based on morphology unsuccessful [ see @xcite for a review ] .",
    "the shapes of grb light curves vary widely ; they include single - peak and multi - peak events , long duration emission at low intensity , and rapidly rising time profiles with an exponential - like decay phase .",
    "temporal variability on time scales of the order of milliseconds has been observed , although smooth light curves with little variability are also observed  @xcite .",
    "the study of this variability has lead to theoretical development of the internal emission processes of grbs  @xcite the durations of bursts span a wide range , with the shortest bursts of the order of milliseconds , and the longest duration bursts lasting for hundreds of seconds .",
    "the logarithmic duration distribution of grbs observed by batse appears to exhibit two clusters centered at @xmath00.3 s and @xmath040 s , with a deficit of bursts of duration @xmath02 s dividing the two groups .",
    "there is evidence for a duration ",
    "spectral hardness correlation in which the short duration bursts are harder than the long bursts @xcite .",
    "investigations using other instruments , however , have shown that the division of grbs based on duration is typically energy - dependent  @xcite and the 2 s division found in batse is a result of the detector bandpass .",
    "the prompt spectra of gamma - ray bursts have been measured ( e.g. , @xcite ) over a wide energy range ( @xmath1 kev to several gev ) .",
    "many burst spectra are consistent with a power law at high energies , showing little or no attenuation of high energy photons , while others exhibit an exponential cutoff at high energies .",
    "grb spectra observed by batse at lower energies usually exhibit increasing energy flux at lower energies , with a break between the low and high energy portions of the spectra usually occurring at approximately 100300 kev , although the break has been found below a few tens of kev in x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) studied by the hete-2 experiment  @xcite , as well as several examples of breaks existing in the mev range  ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most , but not all , gamma  ray bursts exhibit significant spectral evolution , usually evolving from hard to soft .",
    "it is because of the many aforementioned reasons that it is appropriate and enlightening to systematically study the spectral properties of grbs .",
    "earlier spatial studies focused on the time - resolved properties of grb spectra , which were only possible for very bright bursts @xcite",
    ". however , there is also a need for analyses that derive properties for all possible bursts .",
    "indeed , several studies made use of a partially complete set of spectral analyses of batse grbs @xcite and one published result has been based upon the complete set @xcite .",
    "the batse dataset of grbs is currently the largest compendium of grb observations from a single instrument , and as an increasing number of observations are made within the lower - energy bandpass @xmath2 and the higher - energy and broader bandpass of @xmath3 , the batse dataset will be an important bridge between the sub - kev , mev , and gev observations of the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "furthermore , although the energy band of the currently operating _",
    "fermi_/gbm completely covers the batse energy range , the gbm can not match the sensitivity and effective area that batse detectors possessed . here , we present the complete set of spectral analyses from which these works were derived , corresponding to the burst selection of the 5b batse burst catalog ( briggs , et al . , in preparation ) , covering the entire batse mission .",
    "all catalog files are available from a public archive ( heasarc , http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/w3browse/cgro/bat5bgrbsp.html ) .",
    "we start with a description of the batse detectors and calibration in section 2 .",
    "this is followed in section 3 by a description of the methodology used in the production of this catalog , including detector selection , data types used , energy selection and background fitting , and the source selection we then offer a description of the spectral models used in this catalog in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we present the spectral analysis methods and results .",
    "the compton gamma  ray observatory ( cgro ) was placed into low earth orbit ( @xmath0400 km ) by the space shuttle atlantis on april 5 , 1991 .",
    "batse was one of four experiments on - board the 17 ton satellite .",
    "it was an eight - module all - sky detector system designed to study gamma ",
    "rays in the energy band of @xmath010 kev20 mev .",
    "each of the eight detector modules were mounted on the corners of cgro .",
    "they consisted of two nai(t@xmath4 ) scintillation detectors : a large area detector ( lad ) , optimized for temporal resolution , and a spectroscopy detector ( sd ) , optimized for energy resolution .",
    "the configuration of the experiment allowed the maximum unobstructed field of view ( approximately @xmath5 steradians ) for a low earth orbit satellite .",
    "each lad contained a nai crystal @xmath051 cm in diameter and @xmath01.3 cm thick that was uncollimated in the forward hemisphere and passively shielded in the aft hemisphere .",
    "the large surface area enabled the collection of a large number of gamma ",
    "ray photons as compared to previous orbiting scintillation detectors , thus providing a superior combination of temporal and energy resolution of observed events .",
    "the lad was mounted on the upper part of the module .",
    "the planes of the eight lad faces formed a canonical octahedron when the modules were in their flight configuration on the cgro .",
    "this ensured that each grb usually illuminated three or four detectors ( with a special case where only two detectors were illuminated ) .",
    "the approximate location of a burst could then be determined by comparing the relative count rates in those detectors that observed the burst @xcite .",
    "the lad angular energy response is , to first order , a cosine function in @xmath6 at low energies , where @xmath6 is the angle of the grb from the normal of the lad crystal .",
    "the response is flatter than a cosine function for energies greater than @xmath0300 kev due to decreasing detector efficiency at higher energies .",
    "the circular configuration and lack of spacecraft interference in the forward hemisphere of each lad essentially removes any azimuthal dependence of the response function .",
    "hence , the lad detector response matrices ( drms ) used in this study do not incorporate any azimuthal dependence in the response function .",
    "the drms are mathematical matrix representations of the detector energy response used to map the observed counts into photons of known energy .",
    "each detector s response is dependent on incident photon energy , the measured detector output energy , and the detector source angle and the earth  source  spacecraft geometry @xcite . for details on the lad effective area and response ,",
    "see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "although most scintillation detectors typically have photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) coupled directly to the crystal , the large surface area of the lads made this impractical for uniform light collection .",
    "the crystal was instead attached to a collection cone that was lined with a highly reflective barium sulfate - based ( baso@xmath7 ) coating .",
    "three pmts collected the scintillation photons and these signals were summed at each detector .",
    "the tubes had a minimum quantum efficiency of 26% at 410 nm @xcite .",
    "the light collection cone was lined with lead and tin layers providing passive shielding in the rear hemisphere up to @xmath8300400 kev .",
    "the outermost tin layer was designed to absorb the k - shell x ",
    "rays produced by gamma interactions in the lead .",
    "the front of the crystal was covered by a plastic scintillator whose light was collected by two 5 cm pmts , the signals of which were also summed at each detector .",
    "the purpose of this plastic scintillator , called the charged particle detector ( cpd ) , was to detect particles that entered the lads .",
    "the instrument could be prevented from triggering due to radiation produced by interactions of these particles with the nai crystal by the detectors optional coincidence / anti - coincidence circuitry ( the instrument operated in anti - coincidence mode for the entire mission ) .",
    "no energy information was available for incident particles ; the plastic scintillator was used solely to aid in identification of charged particle events .",
    "the threshold energy deposition for the charged particle detector was @xmath0500 kev .",
    "each lad was equipped with a system that controlled the high voltages ( gain ) of the photomultiplier tubes with minimal intervention from controllers on the ground .",
    "the automatic gain control ( agc ) algorithm computed and executed adjustments to the pmt high voltages so that a feature in the count spectrum remained in a specified energy channel .",
    "the background feature nominally monitored by the agc was the 511 kev electron ",
    "positron annihilation line that is present in the gamma ",
    "ray background .",
    "the background was calculated as a straight line over a specified range of energy channels and was used to produce a background - subtracted count spectrum .",
    "the channel centroid of the 511 kev line was was computed , and if this centroid was different from a specified channel , the high voltage of a single pmt was adjusted to correct the computed value .",
    "if the background line drifted too far from the programmed energy channel , the gains of the pmts were automatically adjusted @xmath04 volts higher or lower to move the annihilation line back to the correct energy channel .",
    "the pmts were adjusted cyclically , and the range of voltage adjustment was clamped . if the agc attempted to change the high voltage to values outside of the specified range , an error was issued .",
    "this procedure , which occurred approximately every 5 minutes , ensured that the eight lads had nearly equal energies in a given pulse - height channel .",
    "a sample of the variation in the 511 kev calibration line near the beginning and end of the mission is shown in figure  [ 511calib ] , where it is shown that generally the gain varied by only a fraction of a percent .",
    "furthermore , examples of the observed background spectrum near the start and end of the mission can be found in figure [ backspec ] , which displays an enhancement of an activation line at @xmath0191 kev near the end of the mission .",
    "additional details of the energy calibration of the lads such as the crab nebula spectral analysis and energy ",
    "pha relation can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "during its entire 3323 days of operation ( an effective exposure of @xmath02390 days in the grb triggering energy band ) , batse triggered on 2704 grbs , 2145 of which are presented in this catalog .",
    "bursts that were excluded include those with a low accumulation of count rates or a lack of spectral / temporal coverage . in some cases",
    "the data collected onboard the spacecraft would be corrupted during storage or during transmission to ground .",
    "for this reason , many bursts do not have contiguous data and so were not included in the catalog . in a few cases data were available but contained incomplete time history , either through data corruption or count rate truncation from an extreme number of detected counts ( @xmath9 counts / energy channel / s above background , where ` energy channel ' refers to the channels in the triggering energy band ) .",
    "these bursts were also omitted , as were extremely bright detections where the count rates were so large in each energy channel that caused detector saturation , and in some cases pulse pile - up . in order to provide the most useful analysis to the community",
    ", we have attempted to make the method as objective , systematic and uniform as possible .",
    "when we deviate from uniformity we indicate the circumstances clearly .",
    "batse employed a total of 16 detectors in pairs of two on each the eight corners of the spacecraft .",
    "each pair comprised a lad and sd detector .",
    "for the purposes of this catalog , we have chosen to use only the lads because of their much larger effective area , and the fact that the drms for the sds exhibit poor photopeak efficiencies and large off - diagonal drm elements at energies @xmath103 mev @xcite .",
    "the area of each lad was 2025 @xmath11 with a spectral coverage from @xmath020 kev to @xmath02 mev and a peak spectral response at @xmath050200 kev . to ensure sufficient detector response , only detectors with viewing angles to the burst less than @xmath12 with respect to the lad normal",
    "were included in the analysis .",
    "these were selected from the subset of the four brightest detectors for each grb , since the count rate in the detector is highly dependent on the incident angle . in most cases",
    "this resulted in multiple detectors per burst . rather than performing joint spectral fits of all relevant detectors for a burst",
    ", we integrated the count rates over all relevant detectors , while preserving the energy edges , as well as integrating over the detector responses .",
    "this method boosts the signal - to - noise and allows the inclusion of many weaker bursts into the catalog .",
    "another benefit of this method is that it helps to minimize the dilution of noise in the signal selection , especially for bursts less than 2 seconds . a trade - off , however , is that there is an increase in systematic uncertainties that may not be completely accounted for in the error propagation of our results . in appendix",
    "d we show the impact of this is minimal when compared to the benefit of improved statistics .",
    "the primary data type used in this catalog was the 2.048 second resolution cont data , which provided semi - continuous count rate and 16-channel spectral coverage during the entire batse lifetime .",
    "other batse datatypes such as herb or sherb data provide a much higher energy resolution ( 128 and 256 channels respectively ) at the cost of time resolution .",
    "these datatypes provided pre - burst time resolution on the order of @xmath0300 s , which complicates accurate background subtraction .",
    "additionally , the trigger time resolution can vary depending on the count rate , and in many cases the high temporal resolution and trigger data end before the end of the grb , further compromising the spectral analysis .",
    "therefore , cont data are a prime choice for time - integrated spectral fitting since they allow the analysis of any precursor or late - time prompt emission that is not covered by other data types .",
    "unfortunately , this datatype places all of the emission of classically defined short grbs into a single time bin and at times includes background in the signal selection .",
    "the background contamination in this catalog , however , is marginal since most of the short grbs in this catalog have a high signal - to - noise ratio , and they are only slightly affected by the inclusion of a relative small amount of noise .",
    "an example of this is trigger # 206 , which is representative of a lower than average intensity short grb observed by batse .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) for this grb is 5.7 using the single 2.048 s bin in the cont data , compared to a snr of 7.6 when selecting the region in the 16 ms resolution mer data .    the spectral coverage of the cont data is split into 16 bins , including the noise - prone low - energy channel and high - energy overflow channel , so we used the remaining 14 energy channels for spectral fitting .",
    "while this is a coarser energy resolution than some data types such as herb or sherb , 14 channels are more than twice the number of free parameters of the models being fit , so they are statistically sufficient for model fitting and comparison of grbs ( see appendix a for simulations confirming the accuracy of cont data as compared to herb data ) . when cont data were not available ( usually due to data corruption ) , the associated mer data were used if possible .",
    "the native time resolution of mer data was 16 ms but only started at trigger time and extended to less than 200 s after trigger .",
    "the energy resolution is the same as cont data , so the count rates were binned to 2.048 s in order to be compatible with cont data .",
    "mer data were used only if a background model could be fit to the post - burst background and extrapolated through the duration of the burst .",
    "mer data was used for only 15 grbs in this catalog .      with the optimum subset of detectors selected , the best time and energy ranges",
    "are then chosen to fit the data . from the available energy channels in the lads we select channels 1 - 14 , corresponding to energies between @xmath030 kev and @xmath01.8 mev .",
    "this selection is performed to exclude the high - energy overflow channel and the low - energy channel where the instrument response is poor and the background is high . with the resulting time series , we select long pre- and post - burst background intervals to sufficiently model the background and fit a single polynomial ( up to @xmath13 order ) to each energy channel in the background selection . for each detector",
    "the time selection and polynomial order are varied until the @xmath14 statistic map over all energy channels is minimized resulting in an adequate background fit .",
    "typically a first- or second - order polynomial was fit to the background , since batse generally had a fairly stable background due to its constant inertial - pointing . shown in figure [ background ] is an example of the regions selected as background for a grb .",
    "only the bursts using mer data that had a background that could be sufficiently fit with a first order polynomial were included in the catalog , since only post- burst background was available for those bursts with only mer data .",
    "once the background count rates are determined , we subtract the background , convert to counts , and calculate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the 20 kev - 2 mev band for each time bin .",
    "only the bins that had a snr greater or equal to 3.5 sigma were selected as signal .",
    "this criterion ensures that there is adequate signal to successfully perform a spectral fit and constrain the parameters of the fit .",
    "this does however eliminate some faint bursts from the catalog sample ( i.e. , those with no time bins with signal above 3.5 sigma ) .",
    "in addition , this strict cut was performed out of the need to provide an objective catalog , so we note that it is possible that not all signal from a burst was selected",
    ". however , most of the signal below 3.5 sigma is likely indiscernible from the background fluctuations , so a spectral analysis including those bins would likely only increase the uncertainty in the measurements without improving the measurement .",
    "this selection is referred to as the `` fluence '' selection , since it is a time - integrated selection , and is representative of the fluence over the duration of the burst as defined by the count rate bins that are above the snr threshold .",
    "the other selection performed is based on a 2.048 s peak photon flux , namely selecting the single time - history bin of signal with the highest background - subtracted count rate , ( i.e. , the most intense part of the burst ) .",
    "we define the accumulation time as the total amount of signal selected using the 3.5 sigma snr criterion , which ignores quiescent periods during the burst .",
    "figure [ alltime ] shows the distribution of accumulation time based on the signal - to - noise selection criteria .",
    "the accumulation time reported is similar to the observed emission time of the burst , excluding quiescent periods , similar to previous studies by @xcite . as a result of the datatype used in this catalog , the accumulation time is quantized by multiples of 2.048 s , thereby eliminating evidence of bimodality of the accumulation time .",
    "figure [ alltime ] also includes the comparisons of the model photon fluence and photon flux compared to the accumulation time .",
    "note that both comparisons contain two distinct regions associated with short and long grbs .",
    "while there appears to be a very clear correlation between the photon fluence and the accumulation time , there is little correlation between the burst - averaged photon flux and the accumulation time .",
    "we chose five spectral models to fit the spectra of grbs in our selection sample .",
    "these models include a single power law ( pl ) , band s grb function ( band ) , an exponential cut - off power - law ( comp ) , a smoothly - connected broken power law ( sbpl ) , and a @xmath15 gaussian ( gloge ) .",
    "all models are formulated in units of photon flux with energy ( e ) in kev and multiplied by a normalization constant a ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "below we detail each model and its features .",
    "an obvious first model choice ubiquitous in astrophysical spectra , is the simple single power law with two free parameters , @xmath17 where _ a _ is the amplitude and @xmath18 is the spectral index .",
    "the pivot energy ( @xmath19 ) normalizes the model to the energy range under inspection and helps reduce cross - correlation of other parameters . in all cases in this catalog",
    ", @xmath19 is held fixed at 100 kev . while most grbs exhibit a spectral break in the batse passband ,",
    "some weak grbs are too weak to adequately constrain this break in the fits and therefore we chose to fit these with the pl model .",
    "band s grb function @xcite has become a standard spectral form for fitting grb spectra , and therefore we include it in our analysis : : @xmath20 & e \\geq \\frac { ( \\alpha - \\beta ) \\   e_{peak } } { \\alpha + 2 } \\\\ \\biggl ( \\frac{e } { 100 \\ \\rm kev } \\biggr)^ { \\beta } \\exp ( \\beta -\\alpha ) \\biggl [ \\frac{(\\alpha-\\beta ) e_{peak}}{100 \\ \\rm kev \\ ( \\alpha   + 2 ) } \\biggr]^{\\alpha-\\beta } &",
    "e < \\frac{(\\alpha -\\beta ) \\ e_{peak}}{\\alpha + 2 } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] the four free parameters are the amplitude , _ a _ , the low and high energy spectral indices , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , and the @xmath23 peak energy , @xmath24 .",
    "this function is essentially a smoothly broken power law with a curvature defined by its spectral indices .",
    "the low - energy index spectrum asymptotically becomes a power law .",
    "this model is an exponentially cutoff power - law which is a subset of the band function in the limit that @xmath25 : @xmath26\\ ] ] the three free parameters are the amplitude _ a _ , the low energy spectral index @xmath21 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath19 is again fixed to 100 kev , as for the power law model .",
    "another model that we consider in this catalog is a broken power - law characterized by one break with flexible curvature able to fit spectra with both sharp and smooth transitions between the low and high energy spectra .",
    "this model , first published in @xcite where the logarithmic derivative of the photon flux is a continuous hyperbolic tangent , has been re - parametrized @xcite as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 in the above relations , the low- and high - energy power law indices are @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively , @xmath31 is the break energy in kev , and @xmath32 is the break scale given in decades of energy . the break scale is independent and not coupled to the power law indices as it is with the band function , and as such represents an additional degree of freedom .",
    "however , @xcite found that an appropriate value for @xmath32 for grb spectra is 0.3 , therefore we fix @xmath32 at this value .",
    "the final model that we consider in this catalog is a gaussian parametrized with logarithmic energies , or gloge .",
    "the photon model is represented by @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the centroid energy in kev and @xmath36 is the standard deviation at @xmath35 in decades of kev .",
    "this model is identical to the log - parabolic function that is common in investigating bl lac spectra , and has recently been used to study grb spectra @xcite .",
    "to study the spectra resulting from the batse detectors , a method must be established to associate the energy deposited in the detectors to the energy of the detected photons .",
    "this association is dependent on effective area and the angle of the detector to the incoming photons . to do this , detector response matrices ( drms )",
    "are used to convert the photon energies into detector channel energies .",
    "the drm is a mathematical model of the deposition of photon energy in the crystal  a photon that interacts by the photoelectric effect will deposit 100% of its energy , subject to resolution broadening , while a photon that interacts by a single compton scatter may deposit only a portion of its energy .",
    "the exception to this is when a photon carrying the energy of the iodine k",
    " shell escapes the crystal .",
    "the energy calibration determines the energy boundaries of the energy deposition channels .",
    "the response matrices for all grbs in the catalog were made using drm_lad_gen v2.07 of the response generator for batse  @xcite .",
    "the spectral analysis of all bursts was performed using rmfit , version 3.4rc1 .",
    "rmfit employs a modified , forward - folding levenberg - marquardt algorithm for spectral fitting .",
    "the castor c - statistic , which is a modified log - likelihood statistic based on the cash parametrization @xcite is used in the model - fitting process as a figure of merit to be minimized .",
    "this statistic is preferable over the more traditional @xmath37 statistic minimization because of the non - gaussian counting statistics present when studying dim grbs .",
    "although it is advantageous to perform the spectral fitting using c - stat , the statistic provides no estimation of the goodness - of - fit , since there exists no standard probability distribution for likelihood statistics . for this reason",
    ", we also calculate @xmath37 for each spectral fit performed by minimizing c - stat .",
    "this allows an estimation of the goodness - of - fit of a function to the data even though @xmath37 was not minimized ( see appendix c for simulations ) .",
    "this also allows for easy comparison between nested models .",
    "we fit the five functions described in section 4 to the spectra of each burst .",
    "the band and comp functions are parametrized with @xmath24 , the peak in the power density spectrum , while the sbpl is parametrized with the break energy , @xmath38 , and the gloge model is parametrized with the centroid energy @xmath35 .",
    "we choose to fit these five different functions because the measurable spectrum of grbs is dependent on intensity , as is shown in figure [ countrate ] .",
    "observably less intense bursts provide less data to support a large number of parameters .",
    "this allows us to determine why , in many situations , a particular empirical function provides a poor fit , while in other cases it provides an accurate fit . for example",
    ", the energy spectra of grbs are normally well fit by two smoothly joined power laws .",
    "for particularly bright grbs , the band and sbpl functions are typically an accurate description of the spectrum , while for weaker bursts the comp or gloge function is most acceptable .",
    "bursts that have signal significance on the order of the background fluctuations do not have a detectable distinctive break in their spectrum and so the power law is the most acceptable function .",
    "although weaker grbs do not statistically prefer a model with more parameters , it is instructive to study the parameters of even the weaker bursts .",
    "in addition , the actual physical grb processes can have an effect on the spectra and different empirical models may fit certain bursts better than others . the spectral results , including the best fit spectral parameters and the photon model , are stored in files following the fits standard similar to those described in the appendix of @xcite and are hosted as a public data archive on heasarc ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/w3browse/cgro/bat5bgrbsp.html ) .",
    "many of the important spectral quantities are also available in tables available in the electronic version of this catalog following the formats listed in tables  [ bandparms]-[sbplparms ] .    when inspecting the distribution of the parameters for the fitted models , we first define a data cut based on the goodness - of - fit .",
    "we require that the @xmath37 statistic for the fit to be within the 3@xmath39 expected region for the @xmath37 distribution of the given degrees of freedom , and we define a subset of each parameter distribution of this data cut as good if the error is within certain limits . following @xcite , for the low - energy power law indices , we consider good values to have errors less than 0.4 , and for high - energy power law indices we consider good values to have errors less than 1.0 .",
    "for all other parameters we consider a good value to have a relative error of 0.4 or better .",
    "the motivation for this is to show well - constrained parameter values , rather than basing possible interpretations on parameters that are poorly constrained .",
    "in addition , we define a best sample where we compare the goodness - of - fit of all spectral models for each burst and select the most preferred model based on the difference in @xmath37 per degree of freedom .",
    "the criterion for accepting a model with a single additional parameter is a change in @xmath37 of at least 6 since the probability for achieving this difference is @xmath80.01 .",
    "the parameter distributions are then populated with the spectral parameters from the best spectral fits .",
    "the time - integrated fluence distributions are estimated over the duration of the observed emission , where the observed emission is defined as 3.5@xmath39 over the estimated background in the 20 - 2000 kev energy range .",
    "it should be noted that the following distributions do not take into account any spectral evolution that may exist within bursts .",
    "the low - energy indices , as shown in figure [ loindexf ] , distribute about a @xmath40 power law typical of most grbs . accounting for parameter uncertainty , up to 14% of the good low - energy indices",
    "violate the @xmath41 synchrotron `` line - of - death '' @xcite , while an additional 57% of the indices violate the @xmath42 synchrotron cooling limit .",
    "the high - energy indices in figure [ hiindexf ] peak at a slope slightly steeper than @xmath43 and have a long tail toward steeper indices .",
    "note that the large number of unconstrained ( or very steep ) high - energy indices in the distribution of all high - energy index values indicates that a large number of grbs are better fit by the comp model , which is equivalent to a band function with a high - energy index of @xmath44 .",
    "the comparison of the simple power law index to the low- and high - energy indices makes evident that the simple power law index is averaged over the break energy , resulting in a index that is on average steeper than the low - energy index yet shallower than the high - energy index .",

    "most of the peak flux spectral parameters correlate with the fluence spectral parameters on the order of unity .",
    "there are particular regions in each plot where outliers exist , and these areas are indications that either the grb spectrum is poorly sampled or there exists significant spectral evolution in the fluence measurement of the spectrum that skews the fluence spectral values .",

    "[ bestf ] and [ bestp ] the same error cuts used in the good samples were also used for the best parameters . note that the pl index is statistically an averaging of the low- and high - energy power laws ; due to the fact that batse spectral responses have a peak effective area at lower energies ( @xmath0 70 kev )",
    ", we have included pl indices into the best low - energy index distribution .",
    "although in a number of cases the pl model is statistically preferred over the other models in this catalog , the spectral shape represented by the pl is inherently different from the shape of the other models .",
    "therefore , the pl index is not necessarily representative of either the low- or high - energy indices from the other models . in figures [ indexbestf ] and [ indexbestp ] we show where the distribution of pl indices exists relative to the alpha and beta distributions .",
    "the pl index represents 23% of the best fluence alpha distribution and 21% of the best peak flux alpha distribution .",

    ", we investigate the behavior of the parameter values as a function of the photon fluence and peak photon flux for the fluence and peak flux best spectra , respectively .",
    "these distributions are shown in figures [ fluenceparms ] and [ fluxparms ] . when fitting the time - integrated spectrum of a burst , we find the low- and high - energy indices trend toward steeper values for exceedingly more fluent spectra .",
    "these figures show that the simple pl index trends from shallow value of @xmath77 to a steeper value of @xmath78 .",
    "the low - energy index for a spectrum with curvature tends to exhibit an unusually shallow value of @xmath79 for extremely low fluence spectra , and steepens to @xmath80 .",
    "similarly , the high - energy index trends from @xmath81 at low fluence to @xmath82 at high fluence , although this is complicated by unusually steep and poorly constrained indices that indicate that an exponential cutoff results in a more reliable spectral fit . there are a number of cases where the comp spectral index is unusually steep ( @xmath02 ) , which may indicate that the grb is particularly soft and that @xmath24 exists sufficiently below the detector bandpass . in these cases",
    ", batse is only observing the high - energy power law of the grb , which may display an exponential cutoff similar to other grbs at higher energies .",
    "note that in this situation , the measured @xmath24 will not be the true peak of the @xmath83 spectrum , since the true @xmath24 will exist below 20 kev .",
    "in other cases , the high - energy power law may not be cutoff and is well - modeled by a pl model , which could be indicated by high flux grbs with index steeper than 2 .",
    "additionally , to test if the trend seen in the low - energy index versus photon fluence is a product purely of unknown systematics issues from the spectral fitting of weak grbs , we performed five sets of 10000 simulations of the band model by using five different @xmath24 values and a low energy index of 0.5 and a high energy index of 2.6 .",
    "different photon fluences were also simulated by changing the simulated live time of the spectra using 11 equally spaced values in logarithmic space spanning from 0.128  1049 s. the simulations were then fit and the mean and uncertainty of the resulting parameters from each set of simulations was calculated , and the band alpha - photon fluence figure is shown in figure [ alphapfluencesim ] . from these simulations",
    "we deduce that the trend seen in the catalog does not appear to be from systematic effects due to the low fluence of grbs .",
    "in fact , these simulations show that on the average , a grb with a fluence @xmath8410 photons @xmath85 will tend to under - predict the true value of the band alpha , which would show a positive trend if there was only this one systematic effect . the other finding from these simulations",
    "is that only for @xmath86 kev can the band alpha value be reliably found even out to @xmath01000 photons @xmath85 .",
    "when inspecting the @xmath24 as a function of photon fluence , a trend is much less apparent . if a burst is assumed to have significant spectral evolution , then obviously the @xmath24 will change values through the time history of the burst , typically following the traditional hard - to - soft energy evolution .",
    "for this reason , spectra that are integrated over increasingly longer time intervals will tend to suppress the highest energy of @xmath24 within the burst , so a general decrease in @xmath24 is expected with longer integration times .",
    "however , the photon fluence convolves the integration time with the photon flux so that an intense burst with a short duration may have approximately the same fluence as a much longer but less intense burst , albeit in a higher @xmath24 .",
    "this causes significant broadening to the decreasing trend as shown in figure [ fluenceepeak ] .",
    "the distribution of parameters as a function of the peak photon flux show similar trends , although due to the smaller statistics of the shorter integration time , the trends are much more dispersed .",
    "the distributions shown in figure [ fluxparms ] are more susceptible to uncertainty because of the generally smaller statistics involved in the study of the peak flux of the grb , except in some cases where the peak photon flux is similar to the photon fluence . ignoring the regions where the parameters are poorly constrained",
    ", another trend emerges from the low - energy indices ; they appear to become slightly more shallow as the photon flux increases .",
    "the high - energy indices , however , appear to be unaffected by the photon flux , except those that are unusually steep and indicate that an exponential cutoff may be preferred .",
    "additionally , an obvious trend emerges from all figures in [ fluenceparms ] and [ fluxparms ] : grbs with lower photon flux and photon fluence are more likely to be best fit by a simple power law , and brighter grbs with higher photon flux or fluence will typically be best fit by the more complex band or sbpl models .",
    "this trend displays a model- dependent analog to figure [ countrate ] , which shows that the preferred model complexity is correlated to the amount of data present from the burst .",
    "a comparison between different catalogs can be instructive , especially when noting the difference in detector geometry , sensitivity , and bandpass .",
    "for example , the _ fermi_/gbm spectral catalog @xcite contains spectral information of many grbs that were observed by detectors with a total collecting area that is @xmath01/8 of batse , but with a larger bandpass ( @xmath08 kev  40 mev ) and increased high - energy sensitivity . in general , there are no large discrepancies between the two catalogs , although there are subtle differences between the parameter distributions .",
    "table [ bestcomparison ] displays a comparison of the sample mean and standard deviations of the gbm spectral catalog and this catalog .",
    "the gbm spectral catalog contains , on average , shallower low- and high - energy power law indices when compared to this catalog .",
    "the differences are a few tenths of an index , and the distributions in the gbm catalog are not as wide , most likely due to a much smaller sample of grbs .",
    "the average @xmath24 in this catalog is slightly softer and the average @xmath38 is slightly harder than was found from the gbm bursts . as expected , the photon flux distribution for batse is shifted to smaller fluxes due to the much larger collecting area of batse , enabling the detection and observation of weaker bursts .",
    "similarly , the energy flux distribution for gbm is shifted to larger fluxes due to its increased high - energy sensitivity from the bgo detectors .",
    "additionally , when comparing our results to the batse catalog of bright grbs @xcite , there are some marked differences as well , although many of these arise because the @xcite sample studied only the 350 brightest batse grbs .",
    "we investigated the sample mean of the time - integrated spectra for comparison ( see table [ bestcomparison ] ) and found that the average low - energy index and high - energy index on average was slightly steeper when compared to @xcite .",
    "the time - averaged @xmath24 in this catalog , however , is on average softer , most likely due to the fact that included all bursts , not just the brightest bursts detected .",
    "this also affects the @xmath38 , which is also found to be slightly softer in this catalog ; as expected the @xcite catalog reports larger average photon and energy fluxes .",
    "batse provided a uniquely large , homogenous sample of grb spectra over the 20 kev  2 mev energy band .",
    "the broad energy range and long operational life of batse translates to currently the largest and most comprehensive collection of grb temporal and spectral properties .",
    "the distributions contained here are similar to those shown by previous studies , yet contain differences that display the usefulness of studying grbs over different energy bands and sensitivities .",
    "we have shown in many cases that the fitted spectrum of a grb depends in large part on its intensity as well as the detector sensitivity .",
    "this observation implies that weak grbs may have the same inherent spectrum as their more intense counterparts , yet we are unable to accurately determine their spectrum , reinforcing the importance of comparing the spectral parameter distributions from different acceptable models .    in conclusion , we have presented a systematic analysis of 2145 grbs detected with batse during its entire period of operation .",
    "this catalog contains five basic photon model fits to each burst , using two different selection criteria to produce over 19000 spectra and facilitate an accurate estimate of the spectral properties of these grbs .",
    "we have described subsets of the full results in the form of data cuts based on parameter uncertainty , as well as employing model comparison techniques to select the most statistically preferred model for each grb .",
    "the analysis of each grb was performed as objectively as possible , in an attempt to minimize biased systematic errors inherent in subjective analysis .",
    "the methods we have described treat all bursts equally , and we have presented the ensemble of observed spectral properties of batse grbs . this catalog represents the largest sample of grbs to date , and constitutes a wide array of grb spectral properties .",

    "this method also provides a simple , objective approach to selecting signal from a grb on which to do analysis .",
    "there are , however , a few consequences to summing detector counts prior to spectral analysis . one of these consequences is that a new drm for the summed detectors must be created .",
    "the drms , which contain the effective area of each detector as a function of detector  to  source angle and energy , can be summed to produce a new drm appropriate for the summed detectors .",
    "the photon energy and channel energy edges must be averaged accordingly to provide an accurate mapping from channel to photon energy .",
    "because of this averaging , spectral resolution decreases .",
    "as shown in figure [ sumdrm ] , the effective area integrated over photon energies for the summed drm can average features found in the individual drms .",
    "for example , the typical peak response energy for batse detector is @xmath06070 kev , and while the summed drm preserves this approximately , the _ region _ around the peak response energy is slightly broadened due to the summation of the drms .",
    "in addition to the loss of spectral resolution , there may be additional systematic errors associated with performing summed spectral fits . to investigate these effects",
    ", we have performed several monte carlo simulations of grb spectra and compared the results from summing detectors to the joint spectral analysis . for each simulation , we chose a single grb that was best fit by each model used in this catalog .",
    "we created 20,000 simulated spectra for each burst using the best fit fluence spectral parameters .",
    "half of the spectra for each burst were created using the summed detector and response , and the other half were created using the individual detectors and responses .",
    "each simulated spectrum was produced with a poisson deviate background and convolved through the detectors response to produce an accurate representation of an actual grb observed by that detector .",
    "each background  subtracted simulated spectrum was then folded through the associated drm(s ) and fit with the corresponding best fit function .",
    "the parameter distributions resulting from the simulations are shown in figures [ simplglog][simsbpl ] .",
    "it is evident that the parameter estimates between the two methods are similar .",
    "no single parameter has a mean value that deviates more than 2% when comparing the summed and joint detectors , and in general the deviations are much less . in all cases the 1@xmath39 standard deviations of the summed spectral parameters are slightly larger than those of the joint spectral parameters",
    "this increased variance is the systematic error that is added to the parameter estimations when the detectors are summed . in all cases",
    "the difference in the standard deviation is a small fraction of one standard deviation .",
    "another potential consequence of summing detectors is that the resulting fit statistics could be skewed . to measure the amount by which the @xmath37 distributions are affected , we compare the @xmath37 distributions of the simulated joint fits and the simulated summed fits .",
    "since a distribution of @xmath37 values from fitting a model to the data should be a @xmath37 distribution , we expect that when a band function is fit to the simulated data produced from a band function , the resulting distribution of @xmath14 should also be a @xmath37 distribution defined by the number of degrees of freedom of the fit .",
    "however , the figure of merit we are minimizing is not @xmath37 , but c - stat , therefore the resulting distribution is not necessarily expected to represent the ideal case . in figure [ comparechisq ] we show that indeed both the joint and summed @xmath37 distributions deviate from the distribution that is expected in the ideal case . by fitting a @xmath37 distribution to the distribution of @xmath37 , we can estimate the amount of deviation between what is expected and what is produced through the simulations . in this case",
    ", we find that both the joint and summed @xmath37 distributions deviate by the same amount , therefore we conclude that this shift is due to the minimization of c - stat ( instead of @xmath37 ) and not caused by summing the detectors . additionally , we can inspect the reduced @xmath37 , which can be used as a measure of the goodness - of - fit and also represents a comparison between the data and model variances .",
    "ideally , a reduced @xmath37 distribution will peak close to a value of unity , denoting that the model and data variances are as expected .",
    "a value less than 1 implies that the model variances are overestimated , and a value greater than 1 implies that the model variances are underestimated .",
    "as shown in figure [ compareredchisq ] , the joint and summed reduced @xmath37 distributions in many cases are not the same . in most cases ,",
    "the medians of the distributions are the same , but the summed distribution is much broader .",
    "this indicates that summing the detectors tends to change the model variance .    for the purpose of model comparison",
    ", @xmath37 is an important statistic , and we need to determine if @xmath106 changes when summing detectors . for each of the bursts on which we performed simulations",
    ", we also fit the other models to determine how accurate the summed detectors method is at model selection . for this test ,",
    "we calculate the change in @xmath37 and plot it as a distribution for each simulation .",
    "we then determine the change in the degrees of freedom when fitting each model and the cutoff value we have used for this catalog . because of the additive property of @xmath37 , the @xmath106 values are associated with a @xmath37 distribution represented by the difference in the degrees of freedom between the two models , therefore our criteria of 6 units of @xmath37 per difference in degrees of freedom represents a cutoff in a @xmath37 distribution .",
    "this cutoff value admits a probability in achieving our predetermined change in @xmath37 by chance , so for the summed @xmath107 distributions to be acceptable , the percentage of the distribution existing above the cutoff must be approximately the same as that from the joint distribution .",
    "this would indicate that both methods produce the same model choice at the same probability .",
    "figure [ deltachiband ] shows an example of the comparison of @xmath106 between joint and summed fits . even though the distributions of @xmath106 are different in many cases , approximately the same amount of the summed distribution exists above the cutoff when compared to the joint distribution .",
    "the culmination of the simulation tests between joint fitting of detectors and summing detectors indicates a relatively small loss of information by adding detector count rates and responses prior to fitting .",
    "the details in the response are lost through the summation process , although since the 16-channel cont data does not provide high spectral resolution , this effect is minimal .",
    "the parameter values from the fits vary only negligibly , and the parameter errors are only slightly larger when summing the detectors .",
    "the @xmath37 values that are produced from summed fits slightly deviate from a @xmath37 distribution of the required number of degrees of freedom , but they deviate no more than the joint fit @xmath37 , therefore they are unaffected by the summation .",
    "the reduced @xmath37 , which measures the goodness - of - fit , can however , show significant deviation .",
    "the means of the reduced @xmath14 distributions are typically similar , although their distance from unity can be larger than expected .",
    "in particular , if a fit is required to be within 1@xmath39 of the mean ( @xmath01 ) , the result from the summed detectors will return a small percentage of fits that would have been rejected if fitted with the joint detectors .",
    "finally , the @xmath106 found when comparing models using the summed detectors will succeed in choosing the same model almost all of the time when compared to fitting joint detectors . from these results , we show that summing detectors for this catalog has little adverse effect on the spectral results .",
    "please note that the spectral tables list the raw results of each spectral fit to each grb . in cases where the spectral fit failed , the values reported are those that initialized the spectral fit .",
    "if the uncertainty on the spectral parameters is reported as zero ( no uncertainty ) , then the fit failed . in a few cases throughout these tables , the uncertainties for certain spectral parameters",
    "may be reported as ` 9999.99 ' which indicates that the uncertainty on that parameter is completely unconstrained .",
    "an example of this is when the spectral data from a burst is fitted with a band function but is unable to constrain the high - energy index . in this case ,",
    "the best fit centroid value of the high - energy index parameter is reported , and the ` 9999.99 ' is reported for the uncertainty .    lll column & format & description + 1 & i4 & trigger number + 2 & a4 & detectors used + 3 & a4 & datatype + 4 & f6.2 & total integrated time + 5 & e8.2 & amplitude + 6 & e8.2 & uncertainty in amplitude + 7 & f7.2 & low - energy spectral index + 8 & f7.2 & uncertainty in low - energy spectral index + 9 & f7.2 & high - energy spectral index + 10 & f7.2 & uncertainty in high - energy spectral index + 11 & e8.2 & @xmath24 + 12 & e8.2 & uncertainty in @xmath24 + 13 & f7.2 & photon flux + 14 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon flux + 15 & f7.2 & photon fluence + 16 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon fluence + 17 & e9.2 & energy flux + 18 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy flux + 19 & e9.2 & energy fluence + 20 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy fluence + 21 & f8.2 & @xmath37 goodness - of - fit statistic + 22 & i2 & degrees of freedom +    lll column & format & description + 1 & i4 & trigger number + 2 & a4 & detectors used + 3 & a4 & datatype + 4 & f6.2 & total integrated time + 5 & e8.2 & amplitude + 6 & e8.2 & uncertainty in amplitude + 7 & f7.2 & spectral index + 8 & f7.2 & uncertainty in spectral index + 9 & e8.2 & @xmath24 + 10 & e8.2 & uncertainty in @xmath24 + 11 & f7.2 & photon flux + 12 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon flux + 13 & f7.2 & photon fluence + 14 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon fluence + 15 & e9.2 & energy flux + 16 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy flux + 17 & e9.2 & energy fluence + 18 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy fluence + 19 & f8.2 & @xmath37 goodness - of - fit statistic + 20 & i2 & degrees of freedom +    lll column & format & description + 1 & i4 & trigger number + 2 & a4 & detectors used + 3 & a4 & datatype + 4 & f6.2 & total integrated time + 5 & e8.2 & amplitude + 6 & e8.2 & uncertainty in amplitude + 7 & f6.2 & full - width at half maximum + 8 & f6.2 & uncertainty in full - width half maximum + 9 & e8.2 & centroid energy + 10 & e8.2 & uncertainty in centroid energy + 11 & e8.2 & @xmath24 + 12 & e8.2 & uncertainty in @xmath24 + 13 & f7.2 & photon flux + 14 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon flux + 15 & f7.2 & photon fluence + 16 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon fluence + 17 & e9.2 & energy flux + 18 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy flux + 19 & e9.2 & energy fluence + 20 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy fluence + 21 & f8.2 & @xmath37 goodness - of - fit statistic + 22 & i2 & degrees of freedom +    lll column & format & description + 1 & i4 & trigger number + 2 & a4 & detectors used + 3 & a4 & datatype + 4 & f6.2 & total integrated time + 5 & e8.2 & amplitude + 6 & e8.2 & uncertainty in amplitude + 7 & f7.2 & spectral index + 8 & f7.2 & uncertainty in spectral index + 9 & f7.2 & photon flux + 10 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon flux + 11 & f7.2 & photon fluence + 12 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon fluence + 13 & e9.2 & energy flux + 14 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy flux + 15 & e9.2 & energy fluence + 16 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy fluence + 17 & f8.2 & @xmath37 goodness - of - fit statistic + 18 & i2 & degrees of freedom +    lll column & format & description + 1 & i4 & trigger number + 2 & a4 & detectors used + 3 & a4 & datatype + 4 & f6.2 & total integrated time + 5 & e8.2 & amplitude + 6 & e8.2 & uncertainty in amplitude + 7 & f7.2 & low - energy spectral index + 8 & f7.2 & uncertainty in low - energy spectral index + 9 & f7.2 & high - energy spectral index + 10 & f7.2 & uncertainty in high - energy spectral index + 11 & e8.2 & spectral break energy + 12 & e8.2 & uncertainty in spectral break energy + 13 & e8.2 & @xmath24 + 14 & e8.2 & uncertainty in @xmath24 + 15 & f7.2 & photon flux + 16 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon flux + 17 & f7.2 & photon fluence + 18 & f7.2 & uncertainty in photon fluence + 19 & e9.2 & energy flux + 20 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy flux + 21 & e9.2 & energy fluence + 22 & e9.2 & uncertainty in energy fluence + 23 & f8.2 & @xmath37 goodness - of - fit statistic + 24 & i2 & degrees of freedom +    atteia ,  j.  l. & boer ,  m. 2011 , comptes rendus physique , 12 , 255 band  d.  l. , ford  l. , matteson ,  j. , et al .",
