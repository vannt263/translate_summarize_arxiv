    "surface code architectures are currently being recognized as potentially very powerful platforms for quantum information processing ( qip ) and universal quantum computation @xcite . based on relatively simple two - dimensional ( 2d ) array structures ,",
    "the distinguishing hallmark of code - based qip is redundancy : a rather small number of logical ( or information ) qubits is integrated into the background of a much larger number of physical qubits .",
    "the latter are built from local combinations of elementary hardware qubits and act as so - called stabilizers of the code , i.e. , they are subject to readout operations projecting the system to a well - defined code state .",
    "the encoding of relatively few logical qubits into a large entangled code space provides a highly potent resource for error detection / correction and fault tolerance in quantum operations .",
    "in fact , as long as the microscopic error probability for physical qubit manipulations stays below a rather benign threshold of order @xmath0 @xcite , logical qubits enjoy a topological protection with exponentially small error rates for increasing ratio of physical to logical qubits @xcite .",
    "somewhat less obvious , this encoding strategy also makes the boundaries between hard- and software less rigid than in other qip approaches .",
    "for example , whether a given physical qubit acts as stabilizer or as storage space for logical information in each computation cycle will be decided by the code protocols and the applied measurement pattern . to a certain degree , error handling",
    "can then be reduced to simply tracking errors by classical software .",
    "an excellent and detailed review of the surface code approach to quantum computing has been given by fowler _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "however , there is a price to be paid for the high levels of flexibility and fault tolerance in qip based on surface codes , namely the tremendous hardware overhead introduced by the code space .",
    "referring to refs .",
    "@xcite for detailed estimates , the realization of a useful system ( allowing for well - protected qip ) of just a few dozen logical qubits might require to assemble thousands of physical qubits .",
    "this means that maximal efficiency will be critically important to the design of scalable surface code platforms , raising questions both concerning the physical realization of the code and , equally important , its operation :    _ realization. _ what levels of physical qubit integration can be reached at nanoscopic or mesoscopic length scales ?",
    "how much hardware overhead is required to define , manipulate , and read out logical qubit states ? to what extent is the manipulation of individual qubits detrimental to the operation of the code , say , with regard to generated heat or radiation levels ?",
    "if external electromagnetic fields are necessary , can their cumulative effects be kept at bay when large numbers of qubits are integrated ?",
    "_ operation. _ can one address qubits with logarithmic efficiency @xcite , e.g. , via non - invasive multiplexer schemes ?",
    "recalling that code - based qip relies on the repeated readout of many stabilizers , can such measurements be performed at sufficient speed , say , with a cycle time of a few microseconds ? can the full set of logical gates required for universal quantum computation be realized at tolerable efforts ?",
    "how can one avoid decay and dephasing of qubits due to residual interactions , e.g. , with readout or manipulation devices , or between qubits themselves ?    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have argued that topological hybrid superconductor / semiconductor architectures featuring majorana bound states might evolve into a platform performing favorably with regard to many of the above criteria .",
    "( for reviews on majorana states in such devices , see refs .",
    "majorana surface codes are also discussed in refs .",
    "given that not even a single topological semiconductor qubit has been realized so far , this assertion may seem presumptuous .",
    "however , current striking developments in the materials foundations of topological semiconductor devices , including experimentally observed signatures of majorana states , see refs .",
    "@xcite , give rise to cautious optimism that the realization of functioning device architectures is but a matter of time .",
    "two developments in particular seem of key importance .",
    "first , progress in the growth of high - quality superconductor / semiconductor interfaces has been instrumental to the formation of hard excitation gaps and to the protection of majorana states @xcite .",
    "second , the successful realization of 2d superconductor / semiconductor heterostructures @xcite suggests that it may be advantageous to switch from nanowire architectures to genuine 2d layouts . for concreteness , we describe the wire construction below .",
    "however , we do not expect that the analogous formulation of a 2d architecture will differ on a conceptual level .",
    "once realized , either structure will be accessible in terms of the full spectrum of device manipulations and measurement protocols of mesoscopic quantum electronics , including ( i ) quantum interferometry by point contact measurements of the linear conductance , ( ii ) access by quantum dots that allow one to pump single electrons on and off the code , and ( iii ) the option to connect and disconnect qubits from the code by tuning selected voltages .    to make these statements more concrete ,",
    "let us start with a brief synopsis of the key features of a majorana surface code , see also sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] below .",
    "its skeleton structure is defined by a regular square lattice of so - called majorana - cooper boxes ( mcbs ) linked by tunnel bridges , see fig .",
    "each mcb corresponds to two topological semiconductor nanowires proximitized by a common , floating superconducting island .",
    "the nanowires in the setup of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] are parallel , which means that a homogeneous parallel magnetic zeeman field can synchronously drive them into a topological phase @xcite . within the topological phase ,",
    "each wire supports majorana zero - energy end states , giving rise to a total of four states per mcb .",
    "each majorana state is assumed to be individually tunnel - coupled to an external lead electrode , and to a quantum dot ( or single - electron transistor ) .",
    "we note that the implementation of these access units does not require significant hardware beyond that defining the mcbs as such . below we will augment the hardware described in ref .",
    "@xcite by local interference links between nearby pairs of external leads .",
    "such links can be realized as gate - tunable tunnel bridges that may be switched on and off as needed .",
    "once in place , they will allow for interferometric transport measurements of majorana strings ( e.g. , bilinears ) , which will in turn be instrumental to the manipulation of logical operators .",
    "we note that topological t - junctions required , e.g. , for the braiding of majorana fermions @xcite are not needed in our approach .    assuming a large capacitive charging energy , backgate voltages may be tuned to effect charge quantization on each mcb @xcite .",
    "the low - energy state of a given mcb is then equivalently described by an effective spin-1/2 degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "these spin-@xmath1 variables are the elementary hardware qubits of our system and can be described by pauli matrices @xmath2 for mcb no .",
    "we assume tunnel bridges linking neighboring mcbs into the checkerboard pattern of fig .",
    "this coupling generates spin-@xmath1 ring - exchange processes around the elementary plaquettes ( loops ) of the 2d lattice which may be described as products of mcb pauli operators , either of four @xmath4 or of four @xmath5 .",
    "the emerging two types of composite physical qubits , denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 in fig .  [ f1 ] , are the stabilizers of the surface code .",
    "physically , one may think of the stabilizer qubit as the @xmath8-valued flux captured by the lattice ring - exchange processes .",
    "our basic approach to the repeated stabilizer measurement is quantum interferometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : current passing through two terminals adjacent to a plaquette can pass around this loop in clockwise or anti - clockwise direction , and the interference between these paths identifies qubit states through conductance measurements .",
    "this single - step measurement protocol neither requires ancilla qubits , cf .  also refs .",
    "@xcite , nor hardware beyond that already present in the system . via the above - mentioned interference links",
    ", similar interferometric transport measurements can determine the eigenvalues of arbitrary majorana bilinears and strings , including those of the qubit operators @xmath2 .",
    "we have proposed the basic access hardware and sketched how to perform elementary code operations in ref .",
    "@xcite , including stabilizer readout and the controlled creation of anyonic excitations .",
    "here we take the crucial next step and demonstrate how the semiconductor - based code architecture may become a potent platform for qip .",
    "this includes the initialization , manipulation , protection , and readout of logical qubits in most general terms . in doing so",
    ", we try to strike a middle ground , avoiding excessive levels of material - specific details , yet aiming to be specific enough to let the reader judge on the concrete perspectives of the approach .",
    "our goal is to provide a comprehensive introduction to qip in this code architecture , up to and including the implementation of a minimal set of gates for universal quantum computation .",
    "the information content held by a surface code depends on its effective ground - state degeneracy , which in turn is governed by the number of holes in the code .",
    "holes can be effectively created by excluding individual stabilizers from the readout operation applied to the majority of physical qubits in each computation cycle .",
    "this solution , which resembles the software hole of ref .",
    "@xcite , may be implemented by only switching on ( via gate voltage changes ) the respective tunnel couplings between probe leads and the code when a readout is performed .",
    "we note that it is not sufficient to simply turn off the respective bias voltage in the idle state .",
    "for instance , unbiased leads can still decohere the system .",
    "hardware holes may be created by gate - blocking the intra - code connections along a loop which defines a chosen stabilizer , or a group of stabilizers .",
    "in general , it will be necessary to employ hybrid strategies comprising elements of both the soft- and hardware realization of holes .",
    "for example , when a stabilizer is inactive or remains idle , it may be advantageous to ramp down its connection to the rest of the code so as to minimize unwanted perturbations .",
    "the coupling can then be turned on again prior to initialization , readout , manipulation , or related operations .",
    "it is obvious that experimental efforts will first focus on structures simpler than that of a large 2d code .",
    "this includes 1d chains that may implement so - called repetition codes @xcite which do not achieve the full computational power of a 2d surface code .",
    "nonetheless , many of the manipulation and readout tools needed for qip in the 2d code can already be implemented and tested using small mcb chains or arrays . in a related work @xcite",
    ", we shall discuss minimal models composed of just a few tunnel - coupled mcbs .",
    "we also note that the majorana surface code approach does not rely on the non - abelian braid operations underlying alternative approaches to majorana - based quantum computing @xcite , cf .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "all its operations are performed through conductance measurements , pumping protocols , and/or gate voltage changes .",
    "our logical gate implementations are different , and sometimes much simpler , than those suggested for bosonic codes @xcite , other majorana code realizations @xcite , or platforms relying on non - abelian braiding . given the challenging demands imposed by scalability @xcite , we believe that these signatures may be of critical importance for the successful realization of large - scale systems .    the remainder of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we start out in sec .",

    "basal quantum operations are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , where we demonstrate how logical qubits can be initialized , moved , braided , manipulated , and read out in this architecture .",
    "to that end , we will also introduce a powerful class of generalized pumping protocols . in sec .",
    "[ sec4f ] , we offer an analysis of potential challenges and/or error sources . with those basal operations at hand ,",
    "the implementation of a full set of quantum gates for universal quantum computation is possible using established quantum circuits @xcite , see sec .",
    "the paper ends with concluding remarks in sec .",
    "finally , we note that we often use units with @xmath9 below .",
    "the elementary unit of our architecture is the majorana - cooper box ( mcb ) , described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . in the following",
    "we briefly introduce the mcb , where the emphasis will be on its subsequent integration into a surface code structure .",
    "interested readers may find a concrete proposal for the hardware layout of an mcb in ref .",
    "an isolated mcb consists of a mesoscopic @xmath10-wave superconducting island in contact to two semiconductor nanowires with strong spin - orbit interaction ( e.g. , inas or insb ) . on each wire",
    "a pairing gap is induced by the proximity effect , which we assume to be so large that continuum quasiparticles can be ignored .",
    "residual quasiparticle poisoning effects are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4f ] .",
    "when subjected to a sufficiently strong zeeman field , the wires enter a topological regime with majorana bound states near their ends @xcite .",
    "we here consider wires long enough that direct tunnel couplings between different end states are negligible , but finite - coupling effects are briefly addressed in sec .",
    "[ sec4f ] .    in effect , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , we then have four zero - energy majorana states described by hermitian operators , @xmath11 , which satisfy a clifford anticommutator algebra , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "recalling that a conventional fermion can be built from two majorana fermions , the presence of four zero - energy majorana states implies a four - fold degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy gets lifted by the coulomb blockade , which has to be taken into account because we consider a floating ( not grounded ) island with a large single - electron charging energy @xmath13  mev @xcite . for notational simplicity",
    ", we shall consider the same @xmath14 for all mcbs below .",
    "in what follows , the effective energy scales of the problem are assumed to be below both the proximity - induced pairing gap and the charging energy .",
    "since cooper pairs and majorana fermions both represent zero - energy states , the hamiltonian of a single mcb contains only the capacitive charging energy contribution , @xmath15 where the parameter @xmath16 can be tuned by a backgate voltage . the operator @xmath17 has integer eigenvalues ( @xmath18 ) and counts the fermion number on the mcb . within our low - energy framework ,",
    "these fermions are either bound in cooper pairs or belong to the majorana sector . under coulomb valley conditions ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath16 close to integer values , the charging energy then enforces a well - defined ground - state value for @xmath18 , even if weak tunnel couplings to other code parts are present . depending on our choice for @xmath16 , this value is either even or odd .",
    "since the number of electrons bound in cooper pairs is always even , a parity constraint emerges in the majorana sector @xcite , @xmath19 reducing the four - fold to a two - fold degeneracy . with charge fluctuations being frozen out by coulomb blockade , the low - energy dynamics of the mcb",
    "is then described by an effective spin-@xmath1 variable .",
    "the associated pauli operators @xmath20 correspond to bilinear combinations of majorana operators and afford the representation @xcite @xmath21 note that this representation is consistent with standard pauli matrix relations , @xmath22 and so on . using the parity constraint ,",
    "each pauli operator can equivalently be expressed by the complementary pair of majorana operators , e.g. , @xmath23 . for 2d arrays of mcbs , it is convenient to choose an alternating representation as illustrated in fig .",
    "for mcb no .",
    "@xmath3 , pauli operators ( @xmath24 are assigned for @xmath3 in an odd column ( containing three mcbs in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) , but the unitarily transformed representation @xmath25 will be used for even columns ( with two mcbs in fig .",
    "this convention leads to a maximally transparent representation of stabilizer operators in terms of mcb pauli operators , see eq .",
    "below .    the tunnel coupling between majorana state no .",
    "@xmath26 of an mcb and an attached lead or quantum dot with fermion operator @xmath27 is described by the tunneling hamiltonian @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a complex tunneling amplitude and the phase operator @xmath30 is conjugate to the number operator , @xmath31=2i$ ] .",
    "the factor of two means that @xmath32 creates a cooper pair , @xmath33 , and hence the out - tunneling process contained in eq .   annihilates a single electron charge on the island .",
    "the representation manifestly splits the tunneling process into a transfer of charge and the charge - neutral majorana dynamics .",
    "we next consider a network of mcbs as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where mcb no .  @xmath3 has the fluctuating superconducting phase @xmath34 .",
    "neighboring mcbs are coupled through short tunnel bridges connecting specific pairs of majorana states @xmath35 . describing each contact in terms of the tunneling hamiltonian with tunnel amplitude @xmath36 between @xmath37 and the respective bridge fermion @xmath38",
    ", the effective mcb - mcb tunneling hamiltonian follows by second - order perturbation theory , @xmath39 where @xmath40 contains the low - energy fermion propagator of the bridge .",
    "for a sufficiently short bridge , retardation effects in this propagator are negligible and the coupling constants @xmath41 are effectively time- and/or energy - independent . as an example with the above properties",
    ", one may think of tunnel bridges that include short non - proximitized nanowire segments connecting adjacent mcbs .",
    "such small - sized connectors typically form junction dots , i.e. , few - level systems where electrostatic gating makes the @xmath41 couplings tunable .",
    "for @xmath42 , the ground state of the system enters a frustrated 2d ising phase which is not useful for qip purposes @xcite .",
    "we therefore focus on the regime @xmath43 throughout .    the presence of the exponentiated phase operators in eq .",
    "indicates that a single tunneling process kicks both participating mcbs out of their respective charge ground states , leaving the system in an excited charge state with energy of order @xmath14 .",
    "one option to go back to the charge ground state is given by a trivial reverse tunneling event along the same link which only adds an irrelevant additive constant to the effective low - energy code hamiltonian .",
    "dropping such constants , the leading - order process for relaxing back to the charge ground state comes from ring exchange along the elementary plaquettes involving four mcbs .",
    "the integration over the transient times of order @xmath44 where the system is virtually excited is most conveniently done by applying a schrieffer - wolff transformation @xcite .",
    "we then obtain the effective low - energy code hamiltonian @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 runs over all elementary plaquettes of the 2d network . ignoring the code boundaries for the moment ,",
    "this defines stabilizer operators @xmath47 as products of the eight majorana operators comprising a minimal loop , @xmath48 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath49 in eq .   involve the product of the four tunnel amplitudes around this loop .",
    "note that the fluctuating phases @xmath34 have dropped out of eq .   due to the schrieffer - wolff projection to the charge ground state of each mcb .",
    "a key feature of the hamiltonian   is that all contributing operators commute , @xmath50=0 $ ] , since two plaquettes either share two or no majorana operators . each stabilizer operator is hermitian , @xmath51 , and squares to unity , @xmath52 .",
    "the hilbert spaces defined by the two possible eigenvalues @xmath53 then correspond to the simultaneously measurable physical qubits of the majorana surface code .",
    "it is well known that interacting majorana plaquette models as given in eq .",
    "can be mapped to ( planar versions of ) kitaev s celebrated toric code model @xcite , which features long - range entanglement and topological order .",
    "in fact , our perturbative construction of eq .   directly mirrors kitaev s original derivation of the toric code from a strongly anisotropic variant of his honeycomb model @xcite , cf .  ref .",
    "we note that refs .",
    "@xcite discuss similar interacting majorana networks which may yield alternative code constructions different from a surface code .",
    "the mapping to the toric code also confirms that stabilizers must come in two different types , @xmath54 or @xmath55 , see fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . indeed , by using the mcb pauli operators ( @xmath56 introduced above",
    ", we observe that away from lattice boundaries , every @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) stabilizer operator is equivalently expressed as product of the four @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) pauli operators on the adjacent mcbs numbered by @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 the product is thus taken along the minimal path surrounding the respective plaquette . again in agreement with the planar toric code , stabilizers located at the boundaries of the system only involve three pauli ( six majorana ) operators , see fig .",
    "it is worth noting that one could also take the fermion parity operators @xmath62 , defined as the product of the four majorana operators on mcb no .",
    "@xmath3 , as a third type of stabilizer .",
    "this fact suggests the possibility of a majorana surface code equipped with three different types of stabilizers ( @xmath63 , cf",
    ".  refs .  @xcite . under strong coulomb blockade conditions",
    ", however , the parity constraint ( [ parityconstraint ] ) locks all @xmath62 stabilizers into specific eigenstates .",
    "in what follows , we therefore employ only the @xmath64-type stabilizers as active physical qubits .",
    "in contrast to the commonly studied toric code model with just two couplings @xcite , we observe that the coupling constants @xmath65 in eq",
    ".   may effectively assume random values due to , e.g. , the presence of tunnel phases or device imperfections .",
    "the temporal evolution of the system thus contains a large number of uncorrelated random phases @xmath66 $ ] which lead to dephasing between corresponding stabilizer states with eigenvalues @xmath53 .",
    "protection of logical qubits against such dephasing processes forms an essential part of qip with the surface code and can be effected , e.g. , by reducing the respective @xmath41 couplings through gate voltage changes , see sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] below .",
    "errors could also arise from higher - order corrections to the code hamiltonian in eq .  . for @xmath43 , however , all sub - leading contributions beyond eq .   are suppressed by at least a factor @xmath67 .",
    "such terms are not expected to seriously deteriorate the operation of the code . in any case",
    ", they can be handled in error correction along with the aforementioned and other ( more severe ) error sources , see sec .",
    "[ sec4f ] .",
    "we conclude that the spin-@xmath1 variables represented by the mcb pauli operators constitute the elementary hardware qubits in our setup .",
    "their definition is linked to the existence of topologically protected majorana states .",
    "we therefore expect that these qubits come with long coherence times and thus represent attractive platforms for qip operations in general @xcite .",
    "physical qubits ( stabilizers ) are then defined as products of four mcb pauli operators along the minimal loops of the 2d lattice , see eq .  .",
    "for the definition of logical qubits , see sec .",

    "we introduce the hardware elements needed for initialization , manipulation , and readout of qubits .",
    "in particular , we will describe the implementation of tunnel conductance probes ( including interference links ) , single - electron pumping , and the use of gate voltages .",
    "none of these elements involves the application of radiation fields .",
    "all access operations should be performed in the quasi - adiabatic limit , i.e. , at frequency scales well below the thresholds where radiation might be produced .",
    "the above elements could be integrated directly within the 2d code structure and do not require device technology beyond that needed to build the code itself . in view of the simplicity and flexibility of this architecture , alternative readout and/or manipulation schemes may also be implemented in an efficient manner , see sec .",

    "@xcite , one can form larger holes for implementing logical qubits by combining several ( @xmath86 ) adjacent holes .",
    "( the number @xmath86 is the so - called code distance in terms of physical qubits . )",

    "this exponential scaling justifies the notion of topologically protected logical qubits @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we mostly describe the case @xmath166 , with the understanding that a highly efficient reduction of logical errors is offered by increasing @xmath86 .",

    "third , we note that small deviations from adiabaticity are permitted if diabatic errors are eliminated by intermediate charge measurements on the dots @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the static code parameters yielding @xmath330 in eq .   can be adjusted and fine - tuned .",
    "since the protocol forms a closed loop in control parameter space , in principle , it can be run indefinitely .",
    "for instance , after preparing the desired ancilla state @xmath337 , this state can be post - processed or verified by state tomography .",
    "one can then readjust the code parameters in order to optimize the protocol .",
    "finally , charge dephasing may be a challenge , in particular if the anticrossing energy @xmath473 is very small .",
    "extensions of the protocol ( cf",
    ".  refs .",
    "@xcite ) should be possible and can be used to tackle some of the challenges outlined here .",
    "we leave a detailed investigation to future work .    to conclude , the presented phase gate protocol follows from a gate - steered rotation in the hybrid low - energy subspaces of the quantum dots and the code qubit .",
    "such control and rotations are possible since single - electron tunneling events generate logical string operators acting on the code space , see sec .",
    "[ sec2c ] .",
    "as electrons traverse the code , these strings drag along @xmath155- and @xmath156-type excitations , which can be created and braided in nontrivial interleaved pumping sequences . in the manipulations applied to our code architecture , the coupling to different pauli operators or strings naturally arises from superpositions of tunneling paths through the code .      having discussed a framework of elemental quantum logical operations sufficient to the implementation of gates",
    ", we are now in position to address likely sources of errors or other physical mechanisms detrimental to the functioning of the system . generally speaking",
    ", we expect the topological protection of the elementary majorana particles ( on which our approach is based ) to manifest itself in long coherence and qubit life times .",
    "this may turn out to be an important mechanism keeping the need for active error correction at tolerably low levels .",
    "second , a general advantage of the stabilizer code approach is that clifford gates do not require active error correction @xcite .",
    "measurement errors then merely need to be kept track of , which can be done by classical software @xcite .",
    "we thus are confident that the present majorana - based code can be implemented with a reasonably low operational overhead .",
    "likely error sources and/or challenges include :      these errors are caused by the effectively random ( but static ) coupling constants generated by tunneling processes encircling single or multiple stabilizers . as a consequence , the time evolution even of stationary states leads to dynamical phases .",
    "the ensuing errors are correctable if , in each cycle , they affect less than half of the stabilizers defining an encoded logical qubit @xcite . generally , it will thus be advantageous to reduce or quench off the tunnel couplings contributing to a logical qubit . increasing the physical to logical qubit ratio",
    "then exponentially suppresses the remaining detrimental tunneling terms , and therefore provides exponential protection against dephasing errors .",
    "a second class of dynamical errors has its origin in the less than perfect design of the mcbs .",
    "the functioning of our approach rests on the approximate degeneracy of the two quantum states realized by a mcb in the strong charging limit . that qubit degeneracy gets lifted when the majoranas constituting it hybridize with each other , e.g. , due to the finite length of the mcb semiconductor quantum wires .",
    "the actual splitting for realistic geometries is not yet known and additional experiments on simple majorana - based qubits will be needed to estimate these error rates . in terms of mcb pauli operators , such residual overlaps act as effective magnetic fields . in general , these pauli errors are correctable .",
    "a qualitatively different class of errors originates in quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "for example , quasiparticles may jump on and off neighboring mcbs .",
    "such processes are efficiently suppressed by the charging energy , which in practice results in charge stability over very long times ( hours ) .",
    "nonetheless , quasiparticle poisoning can have detrimental consequences to the operation of the surface code when cooper pairs on a given mcb are likely to break up  a process which has been experimentally verified to occur at time scales beyond 10  ms for single nanowires @xcite .",
    "if the electrons recombine with two different majorana states , this will create a pauli error , which is straightforward to detect via an observable change of the stabilizer states connecting to the mcb .",
    "such pauli errors can again be corrected . on the other hand ,",
    "if only one quasiparticle recombines with a majorana state , the error is hard to correct since the system leaves the computational subspace .",
    "such an event will manifest itself in a flip of the fermion parity operator @xmath62 on a single mcb , in addition to flips of the adjacent @xmath6 and @xmath7 stabilizers .",
    "this error is not correctable anymore , since we do not read out the operator @xmath62 needed to unambiguously detect it in the present scheme .",
    "once such an error has occurred , we are left with an out - of - subspace majorana system plus an isolated quasiparticle .",
    "the latter may remain idle on the mcb for some time . eventually , the original state of the system gets restored ( vanishing of the error ) or recombination with another majorana state takes place ( return to the computational subspace plus a pauli error ) .",
    "if the out - of - subspace time exceeds typical operation times and/or quasiparticle poisoning errors occur on logical qubits , the functioning of the code gets compromised .",
    "fortunately , errors of this type betray themselves via correlated flips of neighboring stabilizers @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "if they turn out to be important , measurements of the box parity operators @xmath474 should be implemented .",
    "however , this will require a modified approach than presented here .",
    "our conductance readout schemes require reference arms for path interference .",
    "quantum coherence will only be preserved if the length of these arms is shorter than the phase coherence length in the relevant material . since the distance between ( zero - energy )",
    "majorana states on a given mcb should be larger than the coherence length in the topological superconductor @xcite , this sets a minimum length for the reference arms as well .",
    "the magnitude of a realistic topological gap is not known , but one expects a decay length of majorana states in the @xmath475 m regime @xcite .",
    "however , even if the coherence length of the reference arm is of order @xmath475 m , the conductance measurement has to be done at low voltages to avoid decoherence of interference signals .",
    "all factors considered , it might be favorable to use a topological wire to extend the coherence of the reference arm , similar to the interferometer suggested by fu @xcite .",
    "( we note that such long links are needed only along the wire direction in fig .",
    "again one will have to rely on experimental progress to determine what the best solution is , and therefore we leave this as an open challenge .",
    "another important issue is to perform stabilizer measurements on a sufficiently fast time scale .",
    "however , the conductance in the readout scheme will be small because the mcbs are operated in the cotunneling regime , and hence the necessary integration time might be long .",
    "a different option is to read out tunneling times by charge measurements , which means that one could change the design by replacing the normal leads with dots and charge sensors @xcite .",
    "this is a known technology with readout times below microseconds @xcite and offers the advantage that only one dot needs to be coupled to each majorana state ( instead of a lead and a dot ) .",
    "also in this case , actual experimental realizations will determine the best strategy .",
    "an interesting question , where the answer depends on the actual readout strategy , is how fast a projective measurement can be .",
    "it will also be important to understand better , on a theoretical level , the time scales for projective measurements when the measured quantities are tunneling rates rather than the transferred charge .",
    "when discussing hardware solutions , errors , and their countering , one should have in mind that the 3d integration envisioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , cf .  also fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , with controllable tunnel junctions connecting the code to another layer containing gate electrodes and probe leads , may be difficult to realize .",
    "this is not a fundamental obstacle , but something that still needs to be developed along with the topological wire layouts .",
    "the first demonstration experiments should therefore be designed in a purely 2d setup @xcite , where one can also address charge vs conductance readout and the role of quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "we now turn to logical gates in the present code architecture , which can be implemented by known quantum circuits @xcite once the basal quantum operations in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] have been realized .",
    "we consider the set @xmath476 of elementary gates , containing the cnot @xmath477 , the hadamard @xmath273 , and the phase gates @xmath478 and @xmath320 .",
    "this set is sufficient for universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "since @xmath479 , the @xmath478-gate is formally not necessary for a minimal set , but access to a simple and efficient realization is highly desired in practice .",
    "we first recall that in the schrdinger picture , the cnot acts on a two - qubit state as @xmath480 , where the unitary operator @xmath481 flips the target qubit @xmath283 iff the control qubit @xmath218 is in a down - state @xcite . the schrdinger description of @xmath477 in eq .",

    "[ f4 ] , the rules in eq .   can be directly implemented by braiding a pair of different - type logical qubits .",
    "we note that the cnot operation for same - type qubits can also be obtained by a variant of our protocol .",
    "however , since braiding is limited to different - type qubits , one then needs additional ancilla qubits serving as target of an intermediate cnot , cf .  refs .",
    "last , as both qubit move and braid operations allow for straightforward iteration on qubits with larger stabilizer and/or string distances ( @xmath483 ) , the corresponding extension of the cnot follows directly .",
    "the hadamard gate applies the operator @xmath484 on a single logical qubit state , @xmath485 , mapping @xmath155-eigenstates @xmath486 to @xmath156-eigenstates @xmath487 ( schrdinger ) or , equivalently , exchanging @xmath488 ( heisenberg ) @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of the majorana surface code comes from the fact that the @xmath273-gate can be realized by moving logical information between adjacent qubits of different ( @xmath489 ) type @xcite .",
