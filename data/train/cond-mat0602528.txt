    "the mapping to the line representation shows that the low  energy sector of a hamiltonian at the klein point can be mapped into a string model .",
    "it is clear that the total number of lines is a conserved quantity under any local physical process , where by `` local '' we mean that the process changes only a finite number of ( spin ) degrees of freedom .",
