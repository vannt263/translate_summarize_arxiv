    "the formulation of gauge theory on a lattice  @xcite combines manifest gauge symmetry with the path integral approach although space - time can not be retained as a smooth manifold and is replaced instead by a discrete structure . in the present paper lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) always refers to pure gauge theory in euclidean space - time .    lgt offers a number of generalizations that do not have a nave continuum analogy such as gauge theory with finite gauge groups . furthermore in three dimensions it is possible to define lgt for quantum groups  @xcite . combining the various actions and boltzmann weights with suitable ` gauge groups ' ( finite groups , lie groups or quantum groups )",
    ", this model has several special cases that belong to different branches of physics and mathematics .",
    "it is at the centre of the relation between lgt with yang ",
    "mills  @xcite or with chern ",
    "simons action  @xcite , the turaev  viro invariant of @xmath2-manifolds  @xcite , a purely algebraic construction of topological quantum field theory  @xcite and @xmath2-dimensional euclidean quantum gravity without or with cosmological constant  @xcite .",
    "at least some of the above constructions are known to have analogies in four dimensions .",
    "even though the question of which is a suitable unified model remains unsolved in full generality , some of the relations known from three dimensions persist also in four dimensions . in the present paper",
    "we concentrate one the standard formulation of lgt and on the crane ",
    "yetter state sum  @xcite .",
    "we present a definition which encompasses both and generalizes four - dimensional lgt to quantum groups .",
    "technically this is realized for ribbon categories which arise as the categories of representations of certain quantum groups and which replace the category of representations of the gauge group of lgt .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the existence of such a generalized lgt in four - dimensional euclidean space - time using ribbon categories .",
    "this model contains the crane ",
    "yetter state sum as",
    "a special case for a particular boltzmann weight and agrees on the other hand with the spin foam model which is strong - weak dual to lgt if the ribbon category is the category of finite - dimensional representations of a compact lie group . beyond this",
    ", it provides a definition of spin foam models in @xmath1 using ribbon categories which includes in particular the proof that this construction is well - defined even in cases in which the model does not correspond to a topological quantum field theory .    at the technical level",
    ", the construction of these spin foam models using ribbon categories can be motivated from the following observations . from the study of non - perturbative quantum gravity",
    "it has emerged that lgt admits a reformulation as a spin foam model  see , for example  @xcite .",
    "many models of interest in quantum gravity are either topological quantum field theories and use ` delta - functions ' as boltzmann weights ( for example  @xcite ) , or they are topological up to constraints which do not change the weights , but restrict the set of admissible representations .",
    "this is the case for some versions of the barrett  crane model  @xcite .",
    "lgt , however , admits more general boltzmann weights , @xmath3 here the compact lie group @xmath4 is the gauge group , the ( local ) action @xmath5 is a real , bounded and @xmath6-integrable class function , and the boltzmann weight @xmath7 is evaluated for each plaquette of the lattice .",
    "this model encompasses lattice yang  mills theory , for example using wilson s action , but it is not restricted to this case . for general background on lgt the reader is referred to standard textbooks , for example  @xcite .",
    "the spin foam model corresponding to the standard formulation of lgt on a hypercubic lattice was constructed in detail in  @xcite where it was found that it generalizes the strong - weak dual of lgt which had been known only in the abelian case  @xcite and for @xmath8 in @xmath9  @xcite before .",
    "the boltzmann weight   enters the spin foam model via the coefficients @xmath10 of its character expansion , @xmath11 here @xmath12 denotes the character of the finite - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath13 , the sum is over equivalence classes of finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath4 , and @xmath14 is the normalized haar measure on @xmath4 .",
    "the way the coefficients @xmath10 appear in the spin foam model dual to lgt  @xcite compared with the ooguri state sum  @xcite indicates that there exists a unified construction encompassing both .",
    "in addition , the fact that the crane  yetter state sum  @xcite can be understood as a generalization of the ooguri model to quantum groups , suggests the construction given in the present paper .",
    "the strategy for the definition of @xmath1 lgt using ribbon categories is as follows .",
    "the construction is based on a triangulation of a closed and oriented piecewise - linear four - manifold @xmath15 which is specified by an abstract combinatorial complex . in the special case of a lie group symmetry ,",
    "the definition shall coincide with the spin foam model dual to lgt if that lgt is formulated on the @xmath16-complex dual to the triangulation ( note that we formulate the spin foam model on the triangulation itself following  @xcite ) . in the lie group case ,",
    "both pictures are available : the spin foam model on the triangulation and lgt on the dual @xmath16-complex .",
    "they are dual to each other in the sense of  @xcite .",
    "physically this means strong - weak duality between lgt and the spin foam model while on the mathematical side the two models are related by a tannaka  krein like reconstruction theorem relating lgt ( formulated in terms of the gauge group @xmath4 ) with the spin foam model ( formulated in terms of the category of representations @xmath17 ) . for details on quantum groups , ribbon categories and the reconstruction theorems ,",
    "the reader is referred to standard textbooks such as @xcite .",
    "the generalization takes place in the spin foam picture where the category @xmath17 is replaced by a suitable ribbon category @xmath18 .",
    "loosely speaking , using the reconstruction theorems , this provides a definition of lgt in which the gauge group is replaced by a quantum group .",
    "technically , the notion of gauge group is lost , but one can think of replacing the algebra of representation functions @xmath19 by a non - commutative algebra ( a suitable ribbon hopf algebra ) while space - time is still given by the ` classical ' lattice .",
    "the generalization from @xmath17 to a generic ribbon category @xmath18 involves choices of the ordering of tensor factors and choices of the braiding whenever tensor factors are exchanged .",
    "these choices are not at all obvious from the lie group case which involves only the symmetric category @xmath17 .",
    "the method to achieve a consistent definition in the spin foam picture is to choose a linear order of vertices for the combinatorial complex and to define the partition function in a way that employs special choices and that refers explicitly to that order .",
    "it is then possible to show in a second step that the partition function is actually independent of the order ( combinatorially invariant ) and is thus well - defined for a given triangulation .",
    "this approach can be seen as a generalization to four dimensions of the strategy which barrett and westbury  @xcite employ in their approach to the turaev  viro invariant  @xcite .",
    "another point of view on the definition given in the present paper is related to the construction of the crane ",
    "yetter state sum in  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite first show that the state sum is independent of the triangulation which in our terminology relies on the choice of a particular boltzmann weight .",
    "triangulation independence then implies combinatorial invariance and thus establishes that the state sum is well - defined . as an alternative proof , it is conceivable to show combinatorial invariance in the first step .",
    "this holds for any choice of boltzmann weights .",
    "one could then prove in a second step that the choice of special boltzmann weights implies triangulation independence by standard arguments as in  @xcite .",
    "the construction presented in the present paper can be viewed as the first of these two steps .",
    "finally , we would like to mention d.  v.  boulatov s approach to lgt for quantum groups in @xmath2 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "his construction makes use of the general result of reshetikhin and turaev  @xcite establishing a functor from the category of ribbon graphs in @xmath20 to the ribbon category @xmath18 .",
    "the strategy in  @xcite is to construct a suitable ribbon graph in the triangulated manifold which then yields a well - defined partition function as the quantum trace of a ribbon morphism .",
    "a related definition of @xmath9 lgt for quantum groups was developed by r.  oeckl  @xcite in which the duality between lgt and its dual spin foam model is understood entirely in terms of manipulations of ribbon graphs .",
    "the approach of  @xcite also develops the correspondence of ribbon categories with suitable quantum groups , namely coribbon hopf algebras , in a way that transparently generalizes the duality transformation of the lie group case .",
    "however , since the reshetikhin ",
    "turaev functor is available only for ribbon graphs in @xmath20 , these approaches do not have a direct generalization to higher dimension . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the functor mainly to justify diagrammatic calculations .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sect_prelim ] ,",
    "we review some mathematical background on the peter ",
    "weyl theory for compact lie groups and on ribbon categories , and we introduce our notation for combinatorial and simplicial complexes . the duality transformation for lgt with lie gauge groups which was derived in  @xcite on a cubic lattice is reviewed in section  [ sect_duality ] and formulated there on a @xmath16-complex . in section  [ sect_ribbonlgt ] , we define the spin foam model generalizing the dual of lgt to suitable ribbon categories .",

    "the structure of the algebra @xmath19 can be understood if @xmath19 is considered as a representation of @xmath58 by combined left and right translation of the function argument .",
    "let @xmath4 be a compact lie group ( or a finite group ) .",
    "there is an isomorphism @xmath59 of representations of @xmath58 .",
    "here the direct sum is over one unitary representative of each equivalence class of finite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath4 .",

    "wilson action _ and the _ heat kernel _ or _ generalized villain action _ are of this form . for details about these actions and about their character expansion , we refer the reader to standard textbooks such as  @xcite .    in general the set of representatives @xmath127 of the simple objects",
    "is countably infinite . however , the partition function   is a convergent series because the boltzmann weight is an @xmath6-function , and its character expansion therefore forms a square summable series due to the peter  weyl theorem . for more details , see  @xcite",
    ".    in this case both pictures , lgt and the spin foam model , are well - defined and are dual to each other in the sense of  @xcite .",

    "the character expansion coefficients behave qualitatively like @xmath511 if the boltzmann weight is of the form @xmath512 . here",
    "@xmath513 is the _ inverse temperature _ , @xmath514 denotes the action and @xmath515 the _ dual action _ , a function assigning a real number to each finite - dimensional irreducible representation of @xmath4 .",
    "the transformation between lgt and the spin foam model thus realizes a low temperature  high temperature duality or a strong - weak duality in the bare coupling @xmath516 if @xmath517 .    for the heat kernel action , the dual action @xmath518 is essentially given by the second order casimir operator @xmath519 of the representation .",
    "one can thus sort the configurations of the spin foam model by the sum of the casimir eigenvalues over all triangles , and recovers the full strong coupling expansion of non - abelian lgt .",
    "observe finally that lgt was formulated here on the @xmath16-complex dual to a generic triangulation . in order to obtain the usual continuum limit ,",
    "the boltzmann weight @xmath520 should now depend on the geometry of the triangle @xmath330 in a suitable way .",
    "if @xmath509 is the category of representations of a finite group @xmath4 , all comments of section  [ sect_special_lgt ] still apply . in this case",
    ", there are only finitely many simple objects up to isomorphism and the partition functions in both pictures , in lgt and in the spin foam model , are well - defined .",
    "it is now also possible to study the ` topological ' boltzmann weight @xmath521 with suitable prefactors , the partition function is then independent of the triangulation and thus forms a topological invariant which is well known and depends only on the gauge group and on the first fundamental group of the manifold .",
    "see , for example , the comments in section  2.2 of  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath18 be a finitely semi - simple and admissible ribbon category satisfying the conditions of corollary  [ corr_peterweyl ] and @xmath127 be a set containing one representative for each equivalence class of simple objects .",
    "this case is beyond the standard formulation of lgt , and only the spin foam model   makes sense .",
    "the partition function is a finite sum .",
    "it is again possible to choose ` topological ' boltzmann weights which here means the quantum dimension of the simple objects , @xmath522 with suitable prefactors the partition function   agrees with the crane ",
    "yetter invariant  @xcite . for",
    "a comparison of figure  [ fig_vertex](a ) with the main diagram in  @xcite , observe that the state spaces @xmath285 used in the present paper can be further decomposed employing semi - simplicity  , for example , @xmath523 if this decomposition is applied to the state spaces associated with all tetrahedra , one has to colour in addition the tetrahedra with simple objects ( the @xmath130 in  ) and the tetrahedra @xmath524 with two types of morphisms , @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "these colourings are used in the standard formulation of the crane ",
    "yetter state sum in  @xcite .",
    "note that the additional weight @xmath527 per tetrahedron in  @xcite is a consequence of the choice of bases of @xmath525 and @xmath528 .",
    "the construction presented generalizes lgt and the crane ",
    "yetter state sum , but also contains the generic case .",
    "here @xmath18 is any admissible ribbon category , in particularly not required to be semi - simple , and the weights @xmath529 for given simple objects @xmath94 can be quite freely chosen .",
    "if the set of colours @xmath127 is finite , the partition function is a finite sum and thus well - defined for any choice of weights .",
    "if @xmath127 is a countable set , similar convergence issues arise as for lie groups  @xcite .",
    "note that here it is also necessary to examine the quantum traces of figure  [ fig_vertex ] in order to prove convergence of the partition function .      if @xmath509 for a compact lie group , for example , @xmath244 , and if the boltzmann weight is chosen to be ` topological ' , @xmath530 the partition function is just a ( divergent ) formal expression .",
    "this is the case for the ooguri model  @xcite which can be formulated in the lgt or in the spin foam picture .",
    "the simplest version of a spin foam model of barrett  crane type  @xcite is obtained from the ooguri model for @xmath531 in the spin foam picture by restricting the representations in all sums to the _ simple _ representations of @xmath531 .",
    "simple here means that the representation is of the form @xmath532 as a representation of @xmath533 for some irreducible representation @xmath94 of @xmath8 .    in order to implement this restriction",
    "one can choose the set of colours @xmath127 to contain one representative per isomorphism class of simple representations of @xmath531 .",
    "however , in addition one has to restrict the sum over @xmath130 in   to simple representations . as a consequence",
    "the state spaces @xmath285 are certain subspaces of @xmath534 .",
    "the results of the present paper can be generalized to state spaces that are subspaces of @xmath534 as long as the pairing   and the maps @xmath74 of definition  [ def_snaction ] can be consistently restricted to these subspaces .",
    "the correspondence with lgt with a partition function   is , however , lost as a consequence of this generalization .",
    "the spin foam model for ribbon categories defined in the present paper generalizes the spin foam model dual to lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) and can be used as a definition of lgt for gauge groups which are quantum groups rather than lie groups .",
    "furthermore the definition presented here encompasses state sum models that are of interest both in topology and in quantum gravity .",
    "the definition presented provides a bridge between the standard ( lie group ) formulation of lgt and the crane  yetter invariant which uses ribbon categories .",
    "it can also be used to construct other spin foam models that do not correspond to topological quantum field theories and provides proofs that they are well - defined .",
    "this work might finally help to make the relation of lgt and the spin foam models used in other areas more transparent and the common concepts and open questions more accessible .",
    "if one seeks to construct even more general spin foam models than defined here , it is worth pointing out that consistency of the definition restricts the quantum traces of figure  [ fig_vertex ] very tightly .",
    "the introduction of further weights , however , seems to be much easier to achieve .",
    "the definition of lgt with ribbon categories presented here is restricted to @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "technically , this is due to the fact that the key diagrams in figure  [ fig_vertex ] are hand made for this construction . due to the generality of ribbon categories it involves choices of over- or under - crossings , and only with a good choice is the partition function well - defined . while the corresponding approaches in @xmath9 @xcite are canonical in the sense that their construction is well - defined due to general principles , the @xmath1 construction presented here involves choices and one has to verify _ a posteriori _ that it is consistent .",
    "it is not obvious whether the result of  @xcite in arbitrary dimension in the lie group case can be generalized to ribbon categories .",
    "it is , in any case , a striking observation that there exist constructions in @xmath9  @xcite and in @xmath1 ( presented here ) which both generalize the spin foam model dual to lgt .",
    "notice , however , that the @xmath9 case can be handled with spherical categories  @xcite which are more general than ribbon categories . for the construction in @xmath1",
    ", we make explicit use of ribbon categories because the basic diagrams in figure  [ fig_vertex ] always contain a crossing .",
    "if ribbon categories are used in the construction in @xmath9 , all spin network observables can be defined  @xcite whereas in @xmath1 there are no canonical expressions for the spin network observables anymore .",
    "it therefore seems that one has to use more and more restrictive structures if one wishes to increase the dimension .",
