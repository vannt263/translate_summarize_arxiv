    "brightness is the current per unit area and solid angle , normalized by the beam energy and it is a key property for a source . a new kind of ion source , the ultracold ion source ( ucis ) has been proposed as an alternative for the lmis @xcite .",

    "this work aims to measure the source temperature of a rubidium ucis , which is an important physical quantity related to the ability to focus the beam .",
    "here we show how an effective source temperature can be extracted from measurements of the minimum spot size achieved in focusing the beam and we demonstrate a new way to focus ion beams .",
    "the ultra low temperature of the source permits collimated beams to be created at low energy ( down to a few ev @xcite ) , which allows using time - dependent fields for accelerating and focusing .",
