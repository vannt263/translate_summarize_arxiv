    "one challenge to understanding disordered solids is the complex geometry of their phase spaces , including the relative positions and interconnections between the different metastable states .",
    "phase spaces are usually too large and complicated to be directly studied . for example",
    ", an @xmath0-particle system typically has a vast abstract @xmath1-dimension phase space ( @xmath2 for position , @xmath2 for velocity ) . here , we propose that some simple models of disordered solids , such as geometrical frustrated spin models , provide an ideal platform for phase - space studies .",
    "their phase spaces can be mapped as nontrivial complex networks , so that the recently developed large tool box of network analysis @xcite can be used to understand phase spaces . on the other hand ,",
    "these phase spaces provide a new class of complex networks with novel topologies .    when a system has competing interactions , there is no way to simultaneously satisfy all interactions , a situation known as frustration",
    ". frustration widely exists in systems ranging from neural networks to disordered solids .",
    "frustration can also arise in an ordered lattice solely from geometric incompatibility @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the three antiferromagnetic ising spins on the triangle shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]a .",
    "once two of them are antiparallel to satisfy their antiferromagnetic interaction , there is no way that the third one can be antiparallel to both of the other two spins .",
    "frustration leads to highly degenerated ground states and , subsequently , to complex materials with peculiar dynamics such as water ice @xcite , spin ice @xcite , frustrated magnets @xcite , artificial frustrated systems @xcite and soft frustrated materials @xcite .    in geometrical frustrated systems , spins on lattices have discrete degrees of freedom , such that their phase spaces are discrete and can be viewed as networks .",
    "a node in the network corresponds to a state of the system .",
    "two nodes are connected by an edge ( i.e. a link ) if the system can directly evolve from one state to the other without passing through intermediate states .",
    "edges are undirected because dynamic processes at the microscopic level are time reversible .",
    "the challenge is how to construct and analyze such large phase - space networks .",
    "for example , how do we identify whether or not two nodes are connected ?",
    "the first model we consider is antiferromagnetic ising spins on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) triangular lattice @xcite . for a large system with periodic boundary conditions , it has @xmath3 degenerated ground states where @xmath4 is the number of spins @xcite .",
    "for example , configuration 3a in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]c is one ground state in the hexagonal area .",
    "we refer to pairs of neighbouring spins in opposite states as satisfied bonds , i.e. , they satisfy the antiferromagnetic interaction .",
    "since one triangle has at most two satisfied bonds ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cubenet]a ) , the ground state should have 1/3 of its bonds frustrated and 2/3 of its bonds satisfied @xcite . if we plot only satisfied bonds , a ground state can be mapped to a random lozenge tiling @xcite , see configuration 3a in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]c .",
    "a lozenge is a rhombus with @xmath5 angles . by colouring lozenges with different orientations with different grey scales",
    ", the tiling can be viewed as a stack of 3d cubes , or as a simple cubic crystal surface projected in the [ 1,1,1 ] direction @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]c .",
    "cube stacks are stable against gravity along the [ 1,1,1 ] direction .",
    "stack configurations have one - to - one correspondence to ising ground states under ` hexagon boundary condition ' , e.g. , see configuration 3a . in the right 3a configuration ,",
    "the black lines are satisfied bonds forming rhombuses and the blue lines are frustrated bonds . in total , there are 20 legal stacks , i.e. , 20 nodes in the phase - space network .",
    "the network is bipartite , i.e. , consisting of alternating red ( even number of cubes ) and black ( odd number of cubes ) states . ]",
    "the ground state has a local zero - energy mode , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]b : the central particle can flip without changing the energy since it has 3 up and 3 down neighbours .",
    "the system can evolve via a sequence of such single spin flips , even at zero temperature .",
    "we call such a local zero - energy mode the _ basic flip_. any configuration change can be viewed as a sequence of such basic flips .",
    "recently , we directly observed such flips in a colloidal monolayer @xcite . in the language of cubes , a basic flip is equivalent to adding or removing a cube , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]b . by continuing to add or remove one cube from the stack surface",
    ", we can access all possible stack configurations in the large box .",
    "thus , the ground - state phase space is connected by this ` hexagonal boundary condition ' .",
    "the corresponding cube stacking in a large box is equivalent to the boxed plane partition problem in combinatorics @xcite .",
    "the total number of ways to stack unit cubes in an @xmath6 box is given by the macmahon formula : @xcite @xmath7 where the hyperfactorial function @xmath8 .",
    "the first several @xmath9 are 20 , 980 , 232848 , 267227532,@xmath10 ( see the number sequence a008793 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . when @xmath11 , all 20 ground - state configurations in fig .",

    "the 20-node phase - space network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]c can be constructed based on the following two facts : ( 1 ) spins have discrete degrees of freedom , such that the phase space is a discrete network ; ( 2 ) any configuration change can be decomposed to a sequence of basic flips .",
    "consequently , we can define an edge between two nodes if the two states differ by only one basic flip ( i.e. , one cube ) , such that the system can _ directly _ change from one node to the other without passing through intermediate nodes .",
    "numerically , we can handle networks only up to @xmath12 stacks with @xmath13 nodes ; nevertheless many general properties have emerged from such small systems .",
    "figure [ fig : histok]a shows the connectivity ( i.e. degree ) distribution @xcite of cube - stack networks .",
    "the connectivity , @xmath14 , is the number of edges incident with the node @xmath15 .",
    "the connectivities of various frustrated systems appear to have gaussian distributions ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : histok ] ) .",

    "other network properties , such as the diameter and the cluster coefficient , can be readily derived from the cube stack picture .",
    "the shortest path length between two nodes is simply the number of different sites among all the @xmath6 sites .",
    "the largest distance , i.e. the diameter of the network , is @xmath6 between the ` vacant ' and the ` full ' states . here",
    ", we define the vacant state as no cube ( i.e. , @xmath6 vacant sites ) and the full state as no vacant site ( i.e. , @xmath6 cubes ) .",
    "the networks have small - world properties @xcite in the sense that the diameter , @xmath6 , is almost logarithmically small compared with the network size , @xmath19 .",
    "the network is bipartite ( see the black and red circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : cubenet]c ) because a cube stack comes back to its initial configuration only by adding and removing the same number of cubes , i.e. , an even number of basic flips .",
    "consequently , the cluster coefficient @xcite , which characterizes the density of triangles in the network , is 0 .",
    "spectral analysis provides global measures of network properties . for an @xmath20-node network ,",
    "the connectivity ( or adjacent ) matrix @xmath21 is an @xmath22 matrix with @xmath23 if nodes @xmath15 and @xmath24 are connected , and zero otherwise . since edges in phase - space networks are undirected , @xmath21 is symmetric and all its eigenvalues , @xmath25 , are real .",

    "@xmath30 is the number of paths ( or loops ) that return back to the original node after @xmath28 steps @xcite . in a bipartite network ,",
    "all closed paths have even steps so that all odd moments are zero .",

    "we rescale the spectral densities by @xmath33 to the unit variance ( see fig [ fig : specdensity ] ) .",
    "the rescaled spectral densities of different frustration models collapse onto the same _ gaussian _ distribution . by counting @xmath34 ,",
    "we show that spectral densities are gaussian at the infinite - sized limit ( see section i of supplementary information ( si ) ) .",
    "this distinguishes phase spaces from other complex networks .",
    "for example , the spectral density of a random network is the semicircle in fig .",

    "their gaussian fits are indistinguishable from the black curve . ]",
    "spectral analysis can also detect the network s community ( or modular ) structures @xcite if there are any . the algorithm in ref .",
    "@xcite identifies some relatively highly connected subnetworks ( i.e. , communities ) .",
    "however , we still observe a number of edges between subnetworks such that the whole phase space has to be considered as fully ergodic .",
    "our simulation shows that the system can easily travel through the whole phase - space network via basic flips and will not be trapped in a local community for a long time .",
    "the fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics is that the dynamic trajectory of a system wanders through all its phase spaces and spends the same amount of time in each equally sized region of the phase space .",
    "however , this ` equal a priori probability postulate ' ( essentially the same as the ` ergordic hypothesis ' @xcite ) is not necessarily true , as einstein noted @xcite .",
    "how the system moves from one configuration to the next depends on the details of the molecules interactions ( e.g. nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions here ) ; these microscopic dynamics may make some configurations more likely than others .",
    "network analysis provides an opportunity to study ergodicity .",
    "unlike billiards with deterministic trajectory , we assume the spin flipping is due to the random thermal motion and not depends on history .",
    "thus the dynamical evolution of the system can be viewed as a random walk on its phase - space network .",
    "it still interesting to ask whether this random walk can uniformly visit each node given the complex topology of the network . in another word , whether the system can visit each possible microstate configuration under the complex constraint of local nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "random walks on a network are rather chaotic , and nodes with higher connectivities will be visited more frequently . thanks to the theorem in ref.@xcite , the mean visiting frequency for node @xmath15 is @xmath41 , which only depends on local connectivity , @xmath14 , and does not depend on the global structure of the network . here",
    ", @xmath42 is the total number of edges .",
    "this theorem is a direct consequence of the undirectedness of edges .",
    "although highly connected nodes are visited more frequently ( @xmath43 ) , interestingly , the equal - probability postulate does not break down because the average time stayed at node @xmath15 is @xmath44 .",
    "basic flips are random and independent of history , meaning that it is a poisson process .",
    "we define the flipping probability of a basic flip within a unit of time as @xmath45 , which is the intensity of the poisson process . in poisson processes ,",
    "the time interval between flips ( i.e. , the staying time ) has an exponential distribution , @xmath46 , and the mean staying time is @xmath47 .",
    "note that multiple flips will _ not _ flip _ exactly simultaneously _ because time is continuous .",
    "therefore we do not need to worry about possible illegal configurations if _ neighbor _ free spins flip simultaneously . for a node with connectivity @xmath48 ,",
    "the superposition of @xmath48 poisson processes is still a poisson process with intensity @xmath49 and , consequently , the mean staying time is @xmath50 . a random",
    "walker has higher frequency ( @xmath51 ) to visit a high-@xmath48 node , but will stay there for a shorter time ( @xmath52 ) , so that the equal - probability postulate is recovered .",
    "boltzmann assumed that molecules shift from one microscopic configuration to the next in such a way that every possible arrangement is equally likely , i.e. , all edges have the same weight .",
    "we find that the equal - probability postulate still holds if edges have different weights ( see appendix b ) , which , for example , can represent different potential barriers in complex energy landscapes in phase spaces .",
    "we further study another frustration model called square ice to identify the more general properties of phase spaces .",
    "square ice is the two - dimensional version of water ice as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : water ] .",
    "it can be viewed as jigsaw tiling @xcite or spin ice @xcite ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : squareiceall]a , d ) .",
    "oxygen atoms are represented by vertices and the relative directions of hydrogen atoms are represented by arrows .",
    "the ground state of the system follows the _ ice rule _ , i.e. , each vertex has two incoming and two outgoing arrows .",
    "it is also known as the six - vertex model since each vertex has six possible configurations ( i.e. , six types of jigsaw tiles ) . for a vertex associated with four ferromagnetic spins ,",
    "frustration is inevitable ( see the example in fig .  [",
    "fig : squareiceall]c ) .    flipping a closed loop of arrows from clockwise",
    "to counterclockwise ( or vice versa ) does not break the ice rule . the smallest four - spin loops in figs .",
    "[ fig : squareiceall]d , g are labeled in red ( clockwise ) and yellow ( counterclockwise ) .",
    "they are basic flips since any configuration change can be decomposed as a sequence of such flips @xcite .",

    "consequently , the phase - space network of square ice can be constructed .",

    "the ice rule guarantees that the height change around a vertex is zero and @xmath56 is independent of the path along which it was computed . from the minimum and maximum possible heights",
    ", we found that dwb yields a stack of building blocks in a tetrahedron ( see fig .",

    "a plaquette can be flipped only when its four neighbor plaquettes have the same height . since each building block",
    "is ` supported ' by four underneath blocks in an effective ` gravity field ' , the stack can be viewed as an fcc lattice along the [ 100 ] direction , see section iii of si .",
