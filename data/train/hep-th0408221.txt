    "it is well known that many physical systems may be efficiently modeled in a reduced number of spatial dimensions . in particular , certain static solutions of nonlinear classical field equations exhibiting solitonic behavior have been used to describe a wide variety of phenomena , ranging from hydrodynamics and condensed matter physics @xcite to relativistic field theories @xcite . at the opposite extreme ,",
    "the possibility that the four fundamental interactions may be unified in theories with extra spatial dimensions has triggered research on the existence of static nonperturbative solutions of nonlinear field theories in more than three spatial dimensions @xcite @xcite .",
    "these extra dimensions may be compact and much smaller than the usual three dimensions of space , as in kaluza - klein ( kk ) theories @xcite , or they may be infinitely large , as in the recent randall - sundrum ( rs ) proposal , where gravity ( and possibly other fields ) can leak into the extra dimension transverse to the 3-dimensional brane where matter and gauge fields propagate @xcite .",
    "there have been many variants of the rs proposal @xcite , including some with more than one brane @xcite or with more than a single large extra dimension @xcite . in either the kk or the rs scenarios ,",
    "there is plenty of motivation to study @xmath0-dimensional nonperturbative field configurations with a large number of quanta @xmath9 , even if their direct production in particle colliders is probably exponentially suppressed as @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "[ there has been much interest recently in the possibility that extra dimensions could produce signatures observable in collider experiments @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "although i will not examine if the objects of the present work could be produced in future collider experiments , the possibility should be kept in mind , especially with more realistic models involving couplings between several fields . ]    in this work , i argue that long - lived _ time - dependent _ @xmath0-dimensional scalar field lumps  _ oscillons _  can exist in a wide class of models , much wider than their static ( solitonic ) counterparts .",
    "furthermore , i show that they exist only below a certain critical number of spatial dimensions , which is uniquely determined by the field s self - interactions .",
    "if the fundamental gravity scale is @xmath11 , the associated length scale of the extra dimensions is @xmath12 .",
    "[ @xmath13 is the number of extra dimensions . ] thus , if @xmath14 tev , @xmath15 cm . for @xmath16 ,",
    "this scenario is still acceptable by current tests of newton s gravitational law @xcite .",
    "even though oscillons ultimately decay , their lifetimes are long enough to produce significant effects : their demise occurs in very short time - scales and hence would appear , in the scenario with large but compact extra dimensions , as a sudden burst of particles from a small region . if these particles are quanta of the scalar field , their masses would satisfy , assuming maximally - symmetric internal dimensions , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the tree - level mass of vacuum excitations satisfying the @xmath0-dimensional klein - gordon equation .",
    "the key point here is that since the mass and size of @xmath0-dimensional oscillons are uniquely determined by the number of spatial dimensions and their interaction potential , they can serve as probes to the dimensionality of space .",
    "a @xmath0-dimensional oscillon hypothetically appearing at the tev energy scale will have a typical size of order @xmath0 tev@xmath20 cm , always much smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "so far , most work in either a reduced or increased number of spatial dimensions has focused on _ static _",
    "solutions involving real scalar fields or scalar fields coupled to other fields .",
    "a recent example is the work by bazeia et al . , where @xmath0-dimensional spherically - symmetric topological defects were found for models with potential @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the particular choice of potential is needed to evade derrick s theorem , which forbids the existence of non - trivial static solutions for real scalar fields in more than one spatial dimension @xcite . when time - dependence is introduced , it is often as a general phase of a complex scalar field , @xmath23 $ ] , such that the equations still allow for localized solutions with static spatial profiles .",
    "nontopological solitons @xcite and @xmath24-balls @xcite are well - known examples of such configurations .",
    "there are exceptions , though .",
    "breathers in one dimension @xcite , and oscillons in two @xcite @xcite @xcite and three @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite are spatially - bound , time - dependent scalar field configurations which are remarkably long - lived .",
    "they are found in many physical systems and models , including vibrating grains , josephson junctions , nonlinear schrdinger equations , ginzburg - landau models , and certain relativistic @xmath25 models , to name a few examples . as will be seen",
    ", they also exist in higher - dimensional models for a wide class of polynomial interactions .",
    "the line element for flat @xmath26-dimensional spacetime is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "i m only concerned here with objects which may exist in the full @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "thus , their typical size @xmath5 will have to satisfy @xmath30 , where @xmath21 is the linear size of the extra dimensions .",
    "since any deformation away from spherical symmetry leads to more energetic configurations @xcite @xcite , i will consider only spherically - symmetric configurations , @xmath3 .",
    "as such , the @xmath0-dimensional spatial volume element can be written as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the surface area of a @xmath0-dimensional sphere of unit radius .",
    "the lagrangian can be written as @xmath33 where a dot means time derivative .",
    "previous results in @xmath34 and @xmath35 have shown that oscillons are well - approximated by configurations with a general gaussian profile @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "in fact , oscillons can be viewed as localized configurations modulated by nonlinear oscillations on the field s amplitude .",
    "i will thus treat the amplitude as a function of time , keeping the radius @xmath36 constant .",
    "the fact that the analytical results to be obtained are verified numerically to great accuracy confirms that this approximation is adequate for this work s purpose .",
    "oscillons are thus modeled as @xmath37\\exp[-r^2/r^2 ] + \\phi_v~,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the core value of the field [ @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is its asymptotic value at spatial infinity , determined by @xmath6 .",

    "from the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ lagrangian2 ] ) one obtains the equation of motion for @xmath51 : @xmath52 if @xmath53 , the amplitude undergoes harmonic oscillations with constant frequency @xmath54 .",
    "this behavior is due to the surface term that resists any displacement from equilibrium , @xmath55 .",
    "note that since the lagrangian was integrated over all space , the model can not describe the fact that the configuration decays by radiating its energy to spatial infinity .",
    "if needed , one could include a phenomenological term @xmath56 in order to mimic this effect ( such as @xmath57 in @xmath35 @xcite ) , although this is not relevant for the present work .    to examine the stability of the motion ,",

    "instabilities occur if @xmath61 .",
    "long - lived oscillons are only possible if the oscillations above the vacuum with amplitude @xmath51 probe regions of @xmath2 for a sustained period of time @xcite @xcite .",

    "the field will simply undergo damped oscillations about @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath67 , instabilities are possible only for @xmath68 or @xmath69 this is the well - known spinodal instability bound @xcite , where the critical wavelength @xmath70 is related to the initial size of the configuration , @xmath36 , by @xmath71 .",
    "when the condition for instability is satisfied , the amplitude @xmath51 will grow without bound as the field rolls down the potential .",
    "this behavior will depend on the damping term , that is , on the rate at which the lump radiates energy to spatial infinity . if the condition eq .",
    "( [ instabquad ] ) is _ not _ satisfied , the amplitude will describe damped oscillations about the origin .",
    "note that this can only happen in a field theory , since the gradient term is needed to allow for @xmath66 even if @xmath72 . in effect , the gradient term stabilizes what would have been an unstable configuration .",
    "this mechanism is favored as @xmath0 increases , as one would expect .",
    "gaussian - shaped bubbles with quadratic potentials are thus short - lived , not a surprising result @xcite : oscillons owe their longevity to nonlinearities in the potential .",
    "furthermore , as it is proven next , a necessary condition for their existence is that the potential satisfies @xmath73 for at least a range of amplitudes .",
    "this is also true for solitons , which do not exist for potentials with positive concavity , e.g. , @xmath74 .",
    "this necessary condition , however , is not sufficient to guarantee the existence of oscillons .",
    "if @xmath6 is cubic , the first thing to notice is that since parity is broken , @xmath6 will always have an inflection point at @xmath75 the choice of vacuum will depend on the sign of @xmath76 : for @xmath77 , @xmath78 ; for @xmath79 , @xmath80 . in either case , the condition @xmath62 will be satisfied whenever @xmath64 has opposite sign to @xmath81 _ and _ for values of @xmath82 as summarized in table 1 .

    "this has been observed numerically for double - well potentials in @xmath34 @xcite and @xmath35 @xcite .",

    ".    for asymmetric double - well potentials the situation changes . from eq .",
    "( [ max - d ] ) it is easy to see that the upper critical dimension @xmath4 can vary as a function of the asymmetry : the larger the absolute value of the asymmetry , the higher @xmath4 . as an illustration ,",

    "of course , it s always possible to obtain accurate results numerically , as shown in figs . 1 and 2 ( in units of @xmath146 ) for @xmath121 and @xmath111 , respectively : an oscillon in 5 dimensional spacetime would have an energy of @xmath147",

    "the results of this work have established that if a potential can support oscillons , they will have a well - defined set of properties which are dimensionally - dependent : their energies [ the approximately flat plateaus of figs . 1 and 2 ] and their average radii .",
    "also , the minimum radius for the initial configurations that lead to oscillons is determined by the dimensionality of space , as seen for the sdw potential in eq .",
    "( [ minrad sdw ] ) .",
    "thus , one can envision that if such configurations were to be observed , and if the interactions were known , their energies and sizes would uniquely determine the dimensionality of space . in the example of fig . 2 above ( @xmath111 ) , with a vacuum scale of @xmath149 tev , a typical oscillon will have a radius @xmath150 cm , while @xmath151 . in this case , a flat space approximation such as the one used here would be quite acceptable , and the observed masses would receive only slight corrections from the extra dimensions . a next step would be to examine if these configurations exist for models with several interacting fields , including those carrying abelian and non - abelian quantum numbers .",
    "it may be possible to find long - lived @xmath0-dimensional @xmath24-balls in @xmath152 models .",
    "if @xmath35 , this includes the standard model and its supersymmetric extensions .",
    "also , an estimate of the oscillon lifetime and its dependence on spatial dimensionality is still lacking . ( note how @xmath111 oscillons live four to five time longer than those in @xmath121 . )    relaxing the constraint of having static , spatially - localized solutions to the equations of motion opens many avenues for further investigation : as was shown in this work , long - lived _ time - dependent _ localized configurations are supported by a wide class of models .",
