    "the strong radio emission and the flat radio spectrum , together with variability studies , suggest the presence of a relativistic jet in some radio - loud nlsy1s . this has been confirmed by the _ fermi_-lat detection of @xmath0-ray emission from some of them . by considering that nlsy1s are usually hosted in spiral galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this could be an indication that all the radio - loud nlsy1s are able to host relativistic jets as powerful as those in blazars , despite the lower bh mass ; alternatively some nlsy1s could have peculiar characteristics allowing the development of these relativistic jets .",
    "the mechanism at work for producing a relativistic jet is not clear , and the physical parameters that drive the jet formation is still under debate .",
    "one fundamental parameter could be the black hole mass , with only large masses allowing for the efficient formation of a relativistic jet .",
    "the large radio loudness of sbs 0846@xmath1513 could challenge this idea if the black hole mass ( between 8.2@xmath22 and 5.2@xmath23 ) estimated by @xcite is confirmed . according to the `` modified spin paradigm '' discussed in @xcite , another fundamental parameter for",
    "the efficiency of a relativistic jet production should be the bh spin , with smbhs in elliptical galaxies having on average much larger spins than smbhs in spiral galaxies .    in this context the discovery of relativistic jets in a class of agn usually hosted by spiral galaxies , such as the nlsy1s , was a great surprise .",
    "we note that bh masses of radio - loud nlsy1s are generally larger with respect to the entire sample of nlsy1s @xcite , even if still small when compared to radio - loud quasars .",
    "the larger bh masses of radio - loud nlsy1s with respect to radio - quiet nlsy1s could be related to prolonged accretion episodes that can spin - up the bhs .",
    "the small fraction of radio - loud nlsy1s with respect to radio - loud quasars could be an indication that in the former the high accretion usually does not last sufficiently long to significantly spin - up the bh @xcite .",
