    "the galactic supernova remnants ( snrs ) are widely suggested to be the dominant source for the cosmic rays ( crs ) at energies below the  knee \" at @xmath7 , most probably through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism @xcite .",
    "though the details are still to be figured out , it is generally believed that the maximum energy of crs accelerated by snrs depends on both the velocity and the kinetic energy of the supernova outflow .",
    "a small fraction of the supernovae has a typical kinetic energy @xmath8 erg and a typical velocity @xmath9 , both are substantially larger than that of normal supernova , where @xmath10 is the rest mass of the sn ejecta .",
    "these peculiar supernovae , such as sn 1997ef , sn 1997dq , sn 1998bw and sn 2002ap , have been called the hypernovae @xcite .",
    "the maximum energy of the protons accelerated at the shock front of a supernova expanding into the uniform dense interstellar medium ( ism ) can be estimated as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number density of ism @xcite .",
    "such a fact motivates some colleagues to suggest that hypernova remnants are the dominant source of cosmic rays above the knee and the cosmic ray spectrum / flux up to @xmath13 ev may be accounted for as long as the variety of supernovae has been taken into account @xcite .",
    "ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) , first discovered in large numbers by the infrared astronomical satellite in 1983 , are among the most luminous objects in the local universe with infrared luminosity @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the large infrared luminosities are attributed to large amounts of dust , which absorb ultraviolet ( uv ) photons and re - radiate them in the infrared ( ir ) .",
    "comprehensive observations show that ulirgs are powered mainly by a large population of hot young stars , i.e. , a  starburst \" , with a significant fraction also containing an ir - luminous agn @xcite .",
    "local ulirgs are exclusively mergers of gas rich galaxies accompanied by concentrated dust - enshrouded starburst , with very high star formation rate ( sfr ) @xmath15 .",
    "the supernova rate is expected to be high and huge amounts of cosmic ray particles are accelerated . moreover , the relatively small sizes @xmath16 of ulirgs mean that the ism density is also quite high , i.e. , @xmath17@xcite , suggesting that the accelerated high energy protons produced in ulirgs have a great chance to interact with the interstellar medium nucleons , to produce pions , and decay into secondary electrons and positrons , @xmath18-rays , and neutrinos .",
    "if the energy loss time of the protons through the proton - proton collisions is shorter than the starburst lifetime and the confinement time , the protons will lose most of their energy before escaping and produce interesting observational signals @xcite .",
    "previously the possible high energy neutrino emission from the starburst galaxies has been investigated by assuming that the observed gev photons are produced via the decay of pions @xcite .",
    "the events are expected to be significantly enhanced if the nearby starburst galaxies host some gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite . in this work , we focus on the pev neutrino emission produced via the interaction of the accelerated cosmic rays with the dense environment in the ulirgs .",
    "though ulirgs are very rare in the local universe , they are vastly more numerous at high redshifts .",
    "the relative contribution of ulirgs to the sfr density of the universe also increases with redshift , and may even be the dominant component at @xmath19 @xcite . thus it is essential to study the role of ulirgs across a wide redshift range in producing pev neutrinos .",
    "observational data shows that core collapse supernovae of type sn - ib / c contribute with @xmath20 of the total sn rate @xcite .",
    "the hypernovae rate to the normal ib / c sn rate is @xmath21 in the local universe @xcite",
    ". therefore the ratio of the hypernovae rate to the supernovae rate can be estimated to be @xmath22 .",
    "recent ir observations show that the sfr density for ulirgs increases rapidly at @xmath23 , and stays as a constant at higher redshift @xmath24 , which can be approximated as @xcite @xmath25    the supernova rate is related to the sfr via @xcite @xmath26 therefore , the hypernovae rate is @xmath27 taking into account cosmology , the hypernovae number occurring in ulirgs with redshift @xmath28 per year is numerically calculated by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the comoving distance , @xmath31 is the light speed .",
    "hereafter , we adopt the hubble constant as @xmath32 , the matter density as @xmath33 , and the dark energy density as @xmath34 in the flat universe .",
    "the protons accelerated by the hypernovae would lose energy into the @xmath18-ray photons , electrons and positrons , and neutrinos , through proton - proton collisions when injected into the interstellar mediums .",
    "a part of the protons energy will convert into neutrinos via the decay of charged pions , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the energy loss time of protons is @xmath37 , where the factor @xmath38 is inelasticity @xcite , and @xmath39 is the inelastic nuclear collision cross section , which is @xmath40 for the protons at energies @xmath41 pev that is of our great interest . introducing a parameter @xmath42 as the surface mass density of the gas , with @xmath43 as the scale of the dense region in the galaxies , the energy loss time reads @xcite @xmath44    gas surface density can be derived from their sfr density based on an empirical relation that sfr surface density scales as some positive power @xmath45 of the local gas surface density , i.e. , the kennicutt - schmidt law @xcite .",
    "@xmath46 ulirgs have sfr @xmath47@xcite .",
    "if we assume a half - light radius of @xmath48 , it yields a sfr density @xmath49 , consistent with observations of ulirgs at both low and high redshifts . according to the kennicutt - schmidt law ,",
    "the derived gas surface density is @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the energy loss time for the known ulirgs is much shorter than the starburst lifetime in ulirgs , which ranges from @xmath51 to @xmath52 years @xcite .",
    "another important factor to determine the fraction of protons energy conversion is the magnetic confinement time of protons . adopting the similar confinement time as the galaxy , and simply considering that the confinement time depends on the proton s larmor radius(@xmath53 ) ,",
    "the confinement time of the proton with energy @xmath54 can be estimated as @xcite @xmath55    it is found in thompson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) @xcite that the magnetic field strength of the starburst galaxies scales linearly with @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 .",
    "consequently , the confinement time can be rewritten as @xmath58 the fraction of the energy that the protons lose into pions is @xmath59 , which is close to 1 as long as @xmath60 . as a result ,",
    "the protons with energy @xmath54 lose almost all of their energy via the proton - proton collision before escaping from the starburst galaxies as long as @xmath61 , which constrains the critical gas surface density @xmath62 as @xmath63 consequently , for the ulirgs with the gas surface density @xmath64 , the cr protons with energy up to @xmath65 will lose almost all their energy via interacting with the dense ism .",
    "the charged pion , whose energy is @xmath66 , will then decay to produce four leptons , which share the energy equally .",
    "therefore , the fraction of the protons energy converted into neutrinos is @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the observed neutrinos in the energy range ( @xmath68 ) are produced by the protons in the energy range ( @xmath69 ) in the ulirgs , where @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the energy fraction of the protons producing the neutrinos with energy between @xmath72 and @xmath73 is ( for @xmath74 ) @xmath75 where we assume the spectrum of the ejected protons as @xmath76 , and @xmath77 is the minimum energy of the ejected protons in the rest frame , and we define a parameter independent on the redshift , @xmath78 . adopting an efficiency factor @xmath79 for the conversion of ejecta kinetic energy into the relativistic cr protons energy @xcite , the total energy of the cr protons is @xmath80 .",
    "hereafter , we take the typical kinetic energy of the hypernova as @xmath81 and @xmath82 . adopting @xmath83 , for the neutrinos with energies @xmath84 pev",
    ", we have @xmath85 .",
    "the total energy of the observed neutrinos from @xmath72 to @xmath73 produced by each hyperonva in the ulirgs is estimated as @xmath86    the produced neutrinos have the similar spectrum as the ejected protons , i.e. , the observed neutrinos spectrum is @xmath87 @xcite , then the normalized coefficient of the neutrino spectrum can be calculated via @xmath88 where we define a parameter @xmath89 to simplify the expression .",
    "consequently , the diffuse pev neutrino flux integrating from local to the high redshift @xmath90 reads @xmath91 where the luminosity distance @xmath92 , while for the specified case with @xmath93 , it reads @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    in figure 1 .",
    ", we show the flux of the diffuse neutrinos , at the energy of @xmath97pev , from ulirgs , grbs and agns , for the ejected protons spectrum @xmath98 .",
    "the diffuse pev neutrino flux contributed by ulirgs from local to @xmath99 is @xmath100 for @xmath93 , which is comparable with the flux of atmosphere pev neutrinos , implying an un - ignorable contribution to the pev neutrino flux .",
    "however , the detection prospect of pev neutrinos from ulirgs is not promising .",
    "we estimate the amount of the detection rate of neutrinos in the energy range @xmath101 via @xmath102 where @xmath103 , varying with the energy of neutrinos , is the exposure coefficient of the detector for the diffuse neutrinos , with the unit of @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "while for @xmath93 we have @xmath106 considering the most sensitive neutrino detector nowadays , i.e. , the completed 86 strings icecube observatory , adopting the effective area varying with the energy of protons , equation ( [ intnnu ] ) gives @xmath107 for one year observation .    .",
    "the black , red , green and purple dash - dotted lines represent the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) neutrinos @xcite referring to the models in @xcite ( among faranoff - riley type ii galaxies , i.e. , frii ) , @xcite ( with the best parameters that fit the cosmic ray data ) , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the black thick solid line represents the sensitivity of icecube 86 strings for 5 years .",
    "the atmospheric neutrinos are presented by the data with error bars , which is measured by icecube @xcite .",
    "the two black dash - triple - dotted lines are the upper bound and lower bound of the atmosphere neutrinos extrapolating to the high energy .",
    "+ , width=359 ]",
    "ulirgs are a group of galaxies with ultra - luminous infrared emission ( @xmath108 ) and a high sfr ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "consequently , a high hypernovae rate , @xmath109 at redshift @xmath110 is expected . since the hypernovae can drive energetic shocks and are able to accelerate protons to @xmath2 ev , we propose that huge amounts of protons with spectrum @xmath111 are ejected into these ulirgs .",
    "the observations indicate that ulirgs have a very high gas surface density , therefore the protons is expected to lose most of their energy through interacting with the dense ism in ulirgs before escaping , providing a un - negligible contribution to the pev neutrinos flux ( @xmath112 ) . its flux comparing with that of the atmosphere neutrinos ,",
    "the grb neutrinos and the agn neutrinos have been presented in fig.1 .",
    "the ulirg neutrino component is likely characterized by a cutoff ( or break ) at @xmath113 a few pev since the hypernovae are likely only able to accelerate the cr protons up to @xmath114 pev and the ulirgs can not confine the protons with energy much larger than @xmath114 pev , either .",
    "such a component may be detected in 20 years by the icecube full configuration .    since the diffuse neutrino emission from ulirgs",
    "are expected to be much rarer ( see fig.1 ) , finally we suggest that the two pev neutrino candidates reported by icecube collaboration @xcite , if cosmological , may be from other energetic sources , such as agns , grbs ( see @xcite , but see @xcite ) , and cosmogenic neutrinos ( see @xcite , but see @xcite ) .",
    "the origins of the reported two pev neutrinos are highly controversial so far , we anticipate more observations from the icecube to draw a firm conclusion in the future .",
