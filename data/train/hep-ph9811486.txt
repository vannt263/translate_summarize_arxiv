    "if we remove the quarks from qcd , there would remain a nontrivial @xmath4 yang - mills theory which must have its own spectrum of states .",
    "these states will become the `` glueball '' states of qcd ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the simple quark model can be extended to incorporate such gluonic degree of freedom . in the bag @xcite model ,",
    "such approach is to proceed by analogy with the `` constituent quark '' to posit the existence of a `` constituent gluon '' with the quantum numbers ( @xmath5 ) of a gluon of weak - coupling perturbation theory @xcite . in the non - relativistic flux tube model @xcite by isgur and paton there is the long - range strong - coupling limit in which the gluonic degree of freedom have condensed into collective string like flux tubes .",
    "a flux tube is a directed element ( or `` string '' ) , and quark(antiquark ) acts as a unit source of the three - dimentional flux tube .",
    "therefore a `` junction '' can annihilate ( be created ) there , i.e. there are flux tube breaking and fusion .",
    "such theoretical picture leads ( see @xcite ) to an understanding of the linear confinement ( quark - antiquark ) potential , to lineary rising regge trajectiries @xcite,@xcite .",
    "hence , in the potential flux tube model , a simple qcd - motivated potential @xcite , @xcite @xmath6 ( here @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) is used for calculation of interaction along to string ( flux tube ) lenght .    in the frame of classical analysis",
    "@xcite olson , olsson and williams have demonstrated that for large angular momenta the leading relativestic qcd corrections can be interpreted as the angular momentum and angular energy of a rotating flux tube .",
    "therefore , the simplest interpretation of these relativistic corrections is to consider the momentum as well as the energy of the interacting field .",
    "so , the relativistic flux tube model @xcite , @xcite arises as the successor to the potential model .    in the relativistic flux tube ( rft )",
    "model @xcite ( see fig.1 ) the energy of motion of the @xmath9-th quark ( fermionic ) is @xmath10 .",
    "the tube is inserted by the four momentum substitution @xcite @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the new canonical four momentum and @xmath13 is the tube four momentum computed by integration along the tube @xcite 0.05 cm @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 , 0.05 cm where @xmath17 is transverse velocity of @xmath9-th quark . as one can see",
    ", the tube substitution is analogous to the introduction of the four potential in qed . for small quark masses",
    "@xmath18 , it can be shown @xcite that @xmath19 and the quarks are dynamically unimportant for large angular momenta . in this limit",
    "we recover ( see @xcite ) the nambu - goto string with regge slope @xmath20 .",
    "the basic assumption of the rft model ( see @xcite ) is that the qcd dynamical ground state for large quark separation consists of a rigid straight tubelike color flux configuration connecting the quarks . the similar physical picture is for classical string solutions in ref .",
    "mitchell , sundborg and turok had considered the decay of massive open string states on the leading regge trajectory .",
    "these correspond to classical string solutions in the form of rigidly rotating rods whose ends move at the speed of light ( see above limit @xmath19 ) . for these states",
    "the lenght @xmath21 of the string is proportional to the mass @xmath22 . in @xcite",
    "mitchell , sundborg and turok had found that the decay rate for a string of a `` classical '' lenght @xmath21 is proportional to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a space dimension .",
    "for example , for our case @xmath24=4 and the decay rate @xmath25 .    hence , rotation of string playes the fundamental role in both the flux tube model ( which has correct theoretical basis for low and middle mass calculations ) and the string theory which has theoretical description for decay up to high mass of string ( see @xcite ) .the question about rotation of string has deep physical connection with a question about relation between radial and orbital excitations , i.e. relation between momenta @xmath26 and @xmath27 in fig.1 .    as it had described in refs.@xcite , @xcite for the case of large orbital excitations @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the radial quantum number ) the system behaves as the transverse rotating string ( i.e. for the quaziclassical long distance approximation it is @xmath31 in fig.1 ) .",
    "it is an analogy with so called dominantly orbital excited states @xcite . in the opposite case @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath33 in fig.1 )",
    "the string is nearly pure inert and almost doest contribute into the kinetic part of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "for example , in the lund fragmentation scheme @xcite , for the force field between quark and antiquark , an approximation of quasiclassical relativistic massless string is realizated",
    ". hence this string does not lie on the regge trajectory , has not orbital momentum and rotation ( i.e. the momentum @xmath34 in fig.1 is neglected ) . as it is emphasized in @xcite",
    "the surface spanned by the massless relativestic string is always a minimal surface .",
    "this means that ( see @xcite ) , in the lund fragmentation scheme , all interior properties of massless relativistic string is determined by the boundary .",
    "therefore in this approximation the string is nearly pure inert and only ( anti)quark as the excited end - point of string has energy - momentum .",
    "therefore , the momentum @xmath34 is neglected and the process is one - dimensional . for high radial excitation of end - point , this approximation is correct to a high degree of accuracy .    at the some time , after lund string fragmentational procedure , the final state consists of a set of string pieces @xcite , which have the energies , momenta and masses , i.e. ones lie on the linear regge trajectories and have rotation at rest .",
    "hence , in fig.1 , the value @xmath34 ca nt be neglected .",
    "therefore in the lund fragmentation model there are the classical massive ( rotating ) string solutions only for small string masses ( meson and baryon hadron states ) .",
    "the lund approximation is starting point for our model . according to results of ref .",
    "@xcite in our string fragmentation scheme we suppose existence of the classical massive ( rotating ) string solutions not only for small mass string states , but for the mean and large mass string states too .    in the relativistic flux tube model @xcite,@xcite and for classical string solutions of string theory @xcite , for large quark separation a rigid straight tube like",
    "color flux configuration connects the quarks . at the some time , in the soft ( i.e. withaut @xmath1 scattering ) proton-(anti)proton interaction , and in the proton - electron interaction , and in electron - positron annihilation for high c.m .",
    "energy , the above both quark and antiquark have long distance strong interaction , ultrarelativistic opposite momenta ( in their center of mass system ) and , due to orbital momentum conservation , they move with non - zero impact parameter . therefore for the short time period between formation and decay of string , there are physical conditions ( for formation and decay ) which are the same as in the flux tube model or in the classical string solutions of string theory @xcite .",
    "hence , at high energy interaction , the cascade decay of massive rotating open string can be serious realistic candidate for description of multiparticle production by the use of cascade multistring production .",
    "the primary string ( arising in electron - positron annihilation , proton - electron or proton-(anti)proton interaction ) has radial direction which is directed along to summary momentum vector of both the quark and antiquark which act as units sources of the three - dimensional primary string ( flux tube ) .",
    "therefore there are correspondingly two degree of freedom for excitation of meson ( baryon ) system @xcite in its rest frame : the values @xmath34 and @xmath26 ( in fig.1 ) . in refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite it is shown that for conventional meson states , where the flux tube is in its ground state , the transverse confinement leads to gauss law distribution for transverse degree of freedom and the string transverse size is about a few hundred mev ( i.e. @xmath350.3 gev ) .",
    "we use this theoretical result in our model , where the longitudinal momentum @xmath26 grows with the mass of string . therefore in our model",
    "there is the average summary physical picture : 0.4 cm    -the string is breaking along to direction which is determined by angle @xmath36 ; 0.3 cm    -the angle @xmath37 is determined by relation between the momenta @xmath34 and @xmath26    from the previous decays ; i.e. rotation of daughter string has direct    connection with rotation of mother string 0.3 cm    -the momentum @xmath34 has `` restricted '' value ( which is determined by    gauss law ) , whereas @xmath26 grows with the string mass .",
    "therefore the string    of very large mass is breaking longitudinally ( i.e. the angle @xmath36 is about    zero ) , and the string of small mass is breaking approximately isotropically ; 0.3 cm    -the average value of angle @xmath36 grows with number of decays of string .",
    "this    is natural result , which corresponds to classical ( rotating ) string solutions    @xcite and to the relativistic flux tube model @xcite where the string rotation    is one in a few basic principles .",
    "0.3 cm    as it is noted above , in ref.@xcite , mitchell , sundborg and turok considered the decay of massive open string states and found that the decay rate for a string of `` classical '' length @xmath21 ( and of mass @xmath38 ) is proportional to @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 for the space - time dimension @xmath24=4 . the branching ratios to differ mass level states illustrate this behaviour graphically in fig.1 ( in ref.@xcite ) , where the dominant decay modes are into one small string and one large string .",
    "the same physical picture can be arise in our model , if we for simplicity suppose that the partial decay rate @xmath41 in the differential kinematical interval of daughter strings is proportional to the kinematical characteristics of daughter strings from this interval , i.e. @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are energy and @xmath45-projection ( i.e. along to @xmath26 momentum in fig.1 ) of momentum of @xmath9-th daughter string in rest frame of decaying string .",
    "therefore the ( density of ) probability for decay of massive open string with mass @xmath38 in to daughter strings with above kinematical characteristics from differential interval is @xmath46 , where convenient variable @xmath47 is used .",
    "both the @xmath48- and @xmath49-distribution functions and gauss law for projections of transverse momentum ( see above ) of daughter string in rest frame of decaying string allow to us to determine the masses , energies and momentum projections of two daughter strings in the rest frame of decaying string ( see fig.1 ) and @xmath49 ca nt be generated independently . ] .",
    "the above theoretical principles and results we use in the algorithm ( see sect.2 ) which is an attemption to construct the monte carlo implementation for breaking of massive open string according to quantitative results for decay of classical string solutions of string theory and to the results of rft model also .",
    "the results of monte carlo calculations is discussed in sects . 3 and 4 .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) algorithm of decay of string is described in this section .",
    "the diagram of cascade breaking of string is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the double line marks the diquark .",
    "the cascade breaking of string is described by the iteration of an elementary process presented in fig.3 : the string is breaking into two non - interacting colourless daughter strings .",
    "three schemes of decay of the string into two strings ( fig.3 ) are taking into consideration in our model . according to the flux tube model ( see fig.1 ) and",
    "in the frame of cascade logic we generate the break of each string in its rest frame . by every break , for example of secondary string of mass @xmath38 ( see fig.2 ) , we know following its characteristics ( in the @xmath50 c.m.s .- collisions , or @xmath0 annihilation c.m .",
    "system with @xmath45 axis along to jet axis . ] ) : the scheme of the decay of secondary string , the flavours of the partons participating in this decay , the mass @xmath38 , the energy @xmath51 and the momentum vector @xmath52 of the decaying string .",
    "we generate the break of each string in its rest frame . for transition from @xmath50 to string rest frame , let us define new @xmath53 frame , where longitudinal momentum of decaying string is equal to zero .",
    "this @xmath53 frame moves with @xmath54 velocity along to @xmath55 axis in the @xmath50 frame and with lorentz - factor @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is transverse mass of @xmath9-th string .    in the @xmath53 frame ,",
    "the decaying @xmath58 string has transverse momentum @xmath59 with projections @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we turn the @xmath53 frame ( in the transverse @xmath62 plane ) to obtain the @xmath63 axis along to the vector @xmath59 .",
    "the parameters of this transformation are @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "let us define this new system as @xmath66 one , and let the @xmath67 frame move with @xmath68 velocity and with lorentz - factor @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is energy of decaying string in @xmath53 frame .",
    "thereby we obtain the @xmath71 rest frame of the string .",
    "the longitudinal @xmath72 axis of @xmath71 frame is parallel to the longitudinal @xmath55 axis of @xmath50 frame . but",
    "according to the flux tube model ( see fig.1 ) the breaking string has rotation , i.e. there is nonzero angle @xmath36 between the flux tube and the @xmath72 axis in our @xmath71 rest frame ( it is c.m .",
    "frame in fig.1 ) . at present",
    "we ca nt calculate @xmath36 angle ( according to theory and simultaneously ) in frame of our mc model ( it is interesting problem which should be overcomed for future mc implementation ) , and so for continuity of rotation ( of rigid straight tube ) from the mother to daughter string we determine the polar angle @xmath36 by the formula @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the modulus of the momentum vector of first(second ) daughter string value is given by eqs.(3),(20 ) , and so if @xmath75 , we can use an approximation @xmath76 . ] in the @xmath71 rest frame ( in fig.1 ) equals to zero . ] , and the azimuthal angle @xmath77 is generated uniformly in the interval @xmath78 .",
    "the above formula takes into account the @xmath36 fluctuations at fixed @xmath79 and the average @xmath36 angle grows with @xmath79 of string . in the string rest frame",
    "@xmath71 the angles @xmath80 are determine the line of string stretch . along this line",
    "the string break is generated , and so we have to determine the new @xmath81 rest system which is given by the @xmath80 angles in @xmath71 system and with the @xmath82 axis along to the vector product is absent in our calculations . ]",
    "@xmath83 . 0.4 cm    a simple model for string breaking involves quark pair creation by the strong chromoelectric field inside the string ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the flavours of quarks , produced from vacuum at the decay of string , are generated according to the relation @xcite @xmath84    in the rft model @xcite,@xcite the transverse confinement leads to gauss law distribution for transverse degree of freedom and the string transverse size is about a few hundred mev .",
    "we use this theoretical result in our model , where in the @xmath81 frame @xmath85 and @xmath86 components of the transverse momentum @xmath87 of first daughter string are generated according to gauss law ( see sect.1 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 is uniformly distributed random number in the range ( 0,1 ) and @xmath90 is parameter , which is @xmath91 = 0.35 gev for the string decays in figs.3b and 3c . for the string decay in figs.3a",
    "the model parameter @xmath90 is @xmath92=0.25 gev ( if valence quarks are u(d)-quarks ) , and the model parameter @xmath90 is @xmath93=0.30 gev ( if only one valence quark is s - quark ) .    in the @xmath81 frame",
    "we determine ( see sect.1 ) the following variables : 0.5 cm @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) are energies ( the momentum projections ( on @xmath45 axis ) ) of first and second daughter strings . generally speaking",
    ", the @xmath45-distribution can be singular one . in this case",
    "the @xmath45-variable should be generated from interval ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "the possible choice for @xmath101 and @xmath102 is the following . according to law of the conservation of energy , at the production of first daughter string",
    "we generate the variable @xmath103 in the interval @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xmath106 where @xmath107 @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the minimal masses of first and second daughter strings ( see fig.3 ) .",

    "therefore ( for simplification ) the minimal mass of first ( second ) daughter string can be determined as the double mass of lightest hadron with quark composition of first ( second ) daughter string ( see appendix 1 ) .    0.4 cm    for production of first daughter string , the distribution density of @xmath103 variable ( for all schemes of the string breaking in fig.3 ) is parameterized by the form ( see sect.1 ) @xmath111 the same scaling does not depend on the mass of mother ( decaying ) string , i.e. this distribution is scaling one . ]",
    "function ( 10 ) can be used for production of second daughter string if we generate the variable @xmath112 ( see eq.(3 ) ) . in the @xmath81 frame the equalities ( 4 )",

    "@xcite,@xcite there is no such result , because for the force field between quark and antiquark , an approximation of quasiclassical relativistic massless string is realizated ( see @xcite and sect.1 ) , therefore the scaling functions are used for the other process ( see fig.4a and sect.1 ) .",
    "for example , in ref.@xcite the scaling function for conversion of the quark into meson+quark is equal to @xmath130 , with @xmath131=0.88 , in ref.@xcite @xmath132 , with @xmath133 .",

    "@xmath24=26 mitchell , sundborg and turok find that the string is likely to break symmetrically ( in contrast to the noncritical dimention ) into two states , each with roughly half the ( mass ) excitation number of the original state .",
    "the same result is for semiclassical decay of excited string states in the flux tube model @xcite , where the space - time dimension @xmath24=4 . at the same time at the decay of a fundamental string @xcite in noncritical dimension",
    "the string decays by emitting a state close to the ground state and a highly excited state . in our monte carlo model",
    "we use decay rates ( from ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the space - time dimension @xmath24=4 .",
    "hovewer , because of momentum - energy conservation we generate the kinematical characteristics of the both daughter strings from intervals which are determined by the conservation laws , the first . the second , because of isotropy of time - space , and because of @xmath188 ( space inversion ) invariance of strong interaction , we can suppose that in the statistical set of decays of mother string ( with fixed mass ) the distributions for kinematical characteristics for first daughter string are the same as ones for second daughter string inside of the above kinematical intervals and @xmath49 variables from sect.2 .",
    "] . therefore our mc calculations yield result that the share of string decays into the state close to the hadron state and a highly excited state is about 25@xmath189 only .",
    "the some other properties of our model one can see by comparison with electron - positron experimental data at the total center of mass energy equal to 3 @xmath190 , where the process of gluon emission practically is absent and we can check model at center of mass energy which is under threshold of charm quark pair production- , @xmath24- , @xmath170-quarks is used . ] .    the most interesting quantitative results for proton-(anti)proton interactions will be given elsewhere , but now it is necessary to stress one interesting property which has direct connection with massive open string dynamics @xcite .    because of the rotation ( fig.1 ) of decaying string ( fig.3 ) , the average transverse momentum of secondary strings ( fig.2 ) grows with the mass of primary string ( the a string in figs.2,5 ) .",
    "a quantitatively illustration of this is in fig.10 .",
    "in other side the average mass of primary string grows with the total energy of collising particles ( @xmath0 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 ) .",
    "therefore the average transverse momentum of secondary strings grows with the total energy of collising particles , and so for the interval of total energy ( in the center of mass system of collising particles ) from 3 gev ( @xmath0 annihilation ) to 1800 gev ( proton-(anti)proton interactions , @xmath193 , @xmath194 ) between partons of collising hadrons is not calculated . ] ) there is agreement between experimental data and our theoretical mc calculations on transverse momentum @xmath183 distribution of secondary particles up to @xmath195 ( see figs.11 - 13 ) .",
    "it is interesting because there is widely known theoretical hypothesis that in the @xmath183 interval ( approximately ) from @xmath196 to @xmath197 the particle production is a result of qcd hard ( @xmath198 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 ) scattering states ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but in our model , all secondary particles are result only of decay @xcite of states of massive open strings ( classical string solutions of string theory @xcite ) and with the same behaviour as for particles which are result of qcd hard scattering states , @xmath193 , @xmath194 ) scattering states , and the detail discussion about @xmath183 distribution are in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . ]",
    "( at least in the @xmath183 scale ) . therefore ( maybe ) one can recover a question about relation between the classical string solutions of string theory and solutions of qcd equations .",
    "our results are a hint that it would be very interesting to construct the monte carlo implementation for the decay of massive open string most closely to results of string theory ( here the quark degrees of freedom dominate ) and the states with angular ( orbital ) momentum @xmath199 ( here the string degrees of freedom dominate ) . ] .",
    "we hope that our model is first step to this aim .",
    "but already the presented string breaking model can be used as an ingredient into any monte carlo model of multiparticle production for different types of collising particles ( @xmath191 , @xmath0 , @xmath200 , heavy - ion reactions ets ) .    for heavy - ion reactions",
    "there is widely known theoretical prediction that hard parton - parton interaction and formation of quark - gluon plasma are two sources of secondary particles with high transverse momenta .",
    "we hope that our calculations shown that the string rotation is also the source of high transverse momenta , and so this result ca nt be ignored in the realistic calculations of high energy reactions .",
    "according to experimental data @xcite for high energy hadron - hadron collisions , for the produced primary hadron from every hadron multiplet the share of the members with big mass grows with total energy of collision .",
    "therefore there is second possibility for determination of the minimal mass ( of first ( second ) daughter string ) , i.e. in second case it is the product of two factors .",
    "the first factor equals to 2 .",
    "the second factor grows with energy . for example , at @xmath201 100 gev the second factor is the mass of lightest hadron with quark composition of first ( second ) daughter string ; at 100 gev @xmath202 1000 gev the second factor is ( with equal probability ) the mass of any hadron with quark composition of first ( second ) daughter string ; at @xmath203 1000 gev the second factor is the bigest mass of the hadron with quark composition of first ( second ) daughter string .",
    "this determination of the minimal mass of the daughter strings leads to the better agreement with the experimental data , but it is not a decisive factor . 0.5",
    "cm      at decay of string of the big mass the sharp angle @xmath36 ( in fig.1 ) leads to the sharp angle between the @xmath45 axis and the momentum vector of the daughter string .",
