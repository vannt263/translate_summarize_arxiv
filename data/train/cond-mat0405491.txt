    "the field of electronic materials based on molecular films is developing very fast . designing new organic - based materials and devices",
    "requires a detailed knowledge of basic processes , such as those controlling the formation of metal / organic interface barriers @xcite .",
    "the evolution of our understanding of this aspect of organic interfaces follows a path which reminds us of the slow process of understanding inorganic semiconductor / metal interfaces .",
    "twenty - five years ago , the main problem was to understand the mechanism of the formation of the schottky barrier .",
    "starting with the schottky and bardeen models , research developed new ideas based on the defect model @xcite and the induced density of interface states model @xcite .",
    "the present consensus on inorganic / metal interfaces is that , unless the interface has many defects , the schottky barrier formation is controlled by ",
    "intrinsic \" interface states induced by the interaction between the inorganic semiconductor and the metal .",
    "several models have been advanced to explain organic semiconductor / metal interface barrier formation .",
    "the schottky - mott model was originally believed to hold for these interfaces , assuming that no interface dipole is formed at the junction , a situation which was subsequently disproved in most cases @xcite . at reactive interfaces ,",
    "the metal - molecule chemical reaction creates gap states that pin the fermi level , a situation that is analagous to that described by the unified defect model proposed for inorganic semiconductor / metal interfaces @xcite .",
    "compression of the metal surface electronic tail by the organic molecules , leading to a change in the metal workfunction , has also been suggested as a mechanism operating in these interfaces @xcite .",
    "this communication focuses on non - reactive interfaces between metals and thin films of low weight organic molecules .",
    "we study several organic semiconductor / metal interfaces within the idis model @xcite and show that the induced densities of states at these junctions are large enough to control the interface barrier formation .",
    "we analyze the chemical interaction between au and several organic molecules : 3 , 4 , 9 , 10- perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride ( ptcda ) , 3 , 4 , 9 , 10- perylenetetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole ( ptcbi ) and 4 , 4 , -n , n- dicarbazolyl biphenyl ( cbp ) ( figure  [ fig1](a ) ) . our quantum - mechanical analysis shows how the weak chemical interaction creates , nevertheless , a local density of states in the organic energy gap , which is large enough to make the idis model applicable and the definition of a charge neutrality level ( cnl ) for the organic molecule meaningful .",
    "our results for these junctions explain their pinning behaviour , which is characterized by the interface slope parameter , @xmath0 . a low value of @xmath1 ( as is the case of ptcda / au and ptcbi / au ) corresponds to strong fermi level pinning , whereas a higher value of @xmath1 ( cbp / au is an example ) means that the change of the barrier height with the metal workfunction is larger : as will be discussed below , this is associated with a smaller density of states induced in the organic energy gap .",
    "consider , initially , the case of a ptcda / au interface .",
    "experimental evidence indicates that ptcda molecules lie flat on the au surface , and that the ptcda monolayer has the two - dimensional pattern shown in figure  [ fig1](b ) .",
    "ptcda crystals can be thought of being formed by the repetition of this layer along the direction perpendicular to the surface @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that , as is typical of organic crystals , intermolecular bonds are weak van der waals bonds that preserve the individuality of the molecules .",
    "this simplifies the analysis of the ptcda - au interaction , reducing it to the case of a single molecule deposited with its plane parallel to the surface .",
    "we should stress that , in principle , the molecule - molecule interaction induces some ( small ) broadening of the electronic levels of each individual molecule , but does not create an electron density of states in the molecular energy gap . since the schottky barrier formation depends on these gap states , we can safely neglect the molecule - molecule interaction and consider only the single molecule - metal interaction .",
    "our analysis of the organic semiconductor / metal interface is made in several steps .",
    "first , the organic molecule is analyzed using a dft - lcao method @xcite ; this is a dft - based theory , which uses a local - orbital basis and the orbital occupation for describing the exchange and correlation energies of the system .",
    "it has been shown elsewhere that this approach is equivalent to other more conventional dft methods that use a local exchange and correlation energy @xcite .    the main problem with dft methods for organic molecules ( and other small molecules )",
    "is that their one - electron eigenvalues do not represent real electron or hole excitations . in particular ,",
    "the dft energy gap is not directly related to either the transport or the optical gap .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that , by using a variation of koopman s theorem @xcite , we can calculate the molecular electronic levels by introducing a relaxation energy in the dft method that is directly related to the exchange - correlation energy .",
    "we have shown for ptcda @xcite that , although this effect is important , the relaxation of the molecular orbitals calculated within dft is negligible @xcite .",
    "this means that , after the dft - lcao calculation for the organic molecule , we need to renormalize the energy levels by means of koopman s relaxation energies in order to obtain a realistic energy spectrum .",
    "we can keep , however , the electronic wavefunctions of the molecule obtained from the dft calculation .     states ; short bars : @xmath2 states ) before ( a ) and after ( b ) koopman s relaxation energies ; the relaxation in the wavefunctions , however , is small .",
    "the dos is obtained by introducing a 0.5 ev fwhm gaussian broadening for each level .",
    ", width=264 ]    figure [ fig2 ] illustrates this situation for ptcda .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the energy spectrum calculated within dft - lcao , while panel ( b ) shows the spectrum after introducing koopman s relaxation energies .",
    "note how the ptcda energy gap increases from 1.6 ev to 5.7 ev due to these relaxation effects ; the molecular wavefunctions associated with the ionization ( homo ) and affinity ( lumo ) levels are assumed to be practically the same before and after the energy relaxation .",
    "there are also solid - state effects associated with long - range electronic polarization .",
    "these are mainly associated with screening of the metal and the organic crystal of the electronic field created by the extra charge ( electron or hole ) introduced in the molecule @xcite .",
    "this correction reduces the energy gap by @xmath31.5ev , although the ionization and affinity wavefunctions of the molecule are not expected to present important modifications .",
    "other polarization effects , due to lattice relaxation and vibronic effects only introduce small corrections , around 0.2ev , further reducing the molecular energy gap @xcite .",
    "regarding ptcda , we fit the molecular transport gap to 3.2ev , which presumably takes into account all the effects discussed above @xcite ; this is done by introducing a rigid shift between the empty and occupied states of figure [ fig2](b ) . for ptcbi and cbp",
    ", we fit the transport gaps to 3.1 ev and 5.1 ev respectively , values which were deduced from experimental optical gaps and exciton binding energies @xcite .    in a second step ,",
    "we calculate the induced density of states at the organic semiconductor / metal interface using chemisorption theory in the limit of weak interaction between the two systems @xcite . in our model",
    ", we assume the organic molecule ( ptcda , ptcbi or cbp ) to be deposited flat on the metal surface , at a distance @xmath4 from the last metal layer , which we will take for the rest of this paper to be au(111 ) .    in our analysis",
    ", we start with the organic molecule wavefunctions , @xmath5 , obtained from the dft - lcao method discussed above , and the metal density of states matrix , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 refer to the local - orbital basis used to describe the metal properties , which are calculated using the dft local - orbital code @xmath9 @xcite . in the limit of weak ptcda - metal interaction , the main effect of the metal",
    "is to broaden the molecular levels @xmath10 by the quantity @xmath11 @xcite :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the hopping interaction between the molecular orbital @xmath5 and the metal eigenfunction , @xmath14 .",
    "equation [ gammai ] can be rewritten in a more convenient way by using the local - orbital basis for the molecule and the metal .",
    "writing @xmath15 , equation [ gammai ] takes the form    @xmath16    neglecting off - diagonal terms with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which tend to cancel each other out , equation [ gammaicij ] is further simplified to    @xmath19    in our calculation , we have only included the interaction of the au 6s orbital with the different orbitals of the organic molecules , c @xmath20 and @xmath21 , n @xmath20 and @xmath21 , o @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and h @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that in equation [ gammai6s ] , @xmath7 refers only to the au 6s orbitals .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows these interactions as a function of the au - atom distance , which obviously depends on the organic - metal distance , @xmath4 .",
    "the organic - metal separation is a difficult issue .",
    "first , no experimental value exists for these systems .",
    "second , conventional dft codes can not be used to calculate @xmath4 , due to the weak van der waals interaction between the metal and the organic molecule @xcite . using indirect information based on : ( a ) the ptcda - ptcda stacking distance , @xmath23  , and , ( b ) the atomic radius of au ( @xmath24  larger than that of c )",
    ", we assume the distances between the last au layer and the plane of the organic molecules considered in this paper to be around @xmath25  .",
    "we make use of this value to calculate @xmath11 from equation [ gammai6s ] .",
    "once @xmath11 is calculated , each molecular level @xmath10 contributes to the organic ldos with the lorentzian function    @xmath26    the total ldos is obtained by adding all the contributions from the different molecular orbitals .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows our results for ptcda , ptcbi and cbp . in these calculations",
    "@xmath27  , @xmath28 ev and @xmath29 ev . note the different broadening of the @xmath30 and @xmath2 levels .",
    "these values were obtained using equation  [ gammai6s ] and the hopping integrals of figure  [ fig3 ] for @xmath27  .",
    "note also the uncertainty on the broadening , due to the uncertainty in the metal - organic distance ( see below ) .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the different molecular levels for each molecule , the @xmath30-(@xmath2-)states being drawn as long ( short ) bars . for each molecule ,",
    "the cnl is calculated by imposing charge neutrality conditions : the total electronic charge below the cnl integrates to the number of occupied molecular states .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] shows the calculated cnls ( measured from the ionization level ) .",
    "also included in this table are the transport gaps for the sake of comparison .",
    "note the similarity between ptcda and ptcbi , with the cnl level rather close to the affinity level .",
    "this is due to the similarity of their energy spectra and transport gaps . in both cases",
    "the cnl is close to the affinity level because of the distribution of @xmath30-states around the energy gap .",
    "the large density of states below the ionization level pushes the cnl upper in the gap . for cbp ,",
    "the cnl is closer to the molecular midgap , due to the larger energy gap and the more symmetric distribution of @xmath30-states around the homo and lumo .",
    "the interface slope parameter , @xmath0 , is given by : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the induced density of states at the fermi energy ( twice the values shown in figure  [ fig4 ] ) , @xmath4 is the metal - organic distance and @xmath35 is the area associated with one organic molecule ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ; a=120 @xmath36 , 191 @xmath36 and 251 @xmath36 , for ptcda , ptcbi and cbp respectively ) .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] compares the experimental and calculated values for the slope parameter .",
    "note again the similarity between ptcda and ptcbi , and the larger value found for cbp .",
    "this is due to the smaller @xmath34 and the larger area @xmath35 .",
    "the different pinning behaviour of the three interfaces is explained : the low value of @xmath1 , as is the case of ptcda and ptcbi on au(111 ) , corresponds to a high pinning at the organic cnl . for cbp / au(111 )",
    ", on the other hand , the larger value of @xmath1 reflects the higher ability of @xmath31 to move within the organic energy gap .",
    "this can be seen in the relation @xmath37 .",
    "having calculated cnl and @xmath1 , we obtain the interface fermi level straightforwardly .",
    "the pinning at the interface reduces the initial difference @xmath38 , to the injection barrier @xmath39 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] also shows the position of the fermi level for interfaces with au .",
    "the position , measured from the ionization level , is shown for each molecular film in table  [ tab:3 ] .",
    "the agreement between the theoretical and experimental positions of @xmath40 and values of @xmath1 is remarkable , although a small difference appears for the slope parameter .",
    "this presumably reflects the approximations introduced in our calculation .",
    "the main source of inaccuracy comes from the assumed value of @xmath4 , which has an error bar of around @xmath41  .",
    "this inaccuracy is mainly reflected in the calculated values of @xmath34 , while the cnl is probably very insensitive to that modification . to ascertain this point",
    ", we recalculated the cnl changing @xmath42 and @xmath43 by factors of up to 2 , and found that its value remains practically the same .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath34 , which changes by 50% when @xmath4 changes @xmath44  .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath4 has probably been overestimated for ptcda and ptcbi by at least @xmath45   in our calculations .",
    "we stress , however , that our results for the interface fermi level show very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "moreover , the main outcome of our analysis is to show that the induced density of interface states is large enough to play a crucial role in the formation of the metal / organic semiconductor barriers .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the mechanism associated with the formation of these interface barriers is the charge transfer between the two materials due to the weak chemical interaction : this creates an electrostatic interface dipole which tends to align the metal fermi level and the organic cnl .",
