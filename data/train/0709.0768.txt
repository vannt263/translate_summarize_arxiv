    "big detectors at high energy colliders require the detection of electrons ( @xmath2 ) and muons ( @xmath3 ) with high efficiency , high purity and high precision for the reconstruction of the decays @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , for the identification of @xmath8 lepton decays to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , for searches for lepton number violation , for the positive tagging of events with missing neutrinos , and for the isolation of event samples with supposed decays of supersymmetric or other massive states decaying partly to leptons .",
    "the muon system of the 4th concept , fig . [ fig:4th ] , achieves almost absolute muon identification for isolated tracks .",
    "we achieve excellent @xmath11 separation using three independent measurements : ( a ) energy balance from the tracker through the calorimeter into the muon spectrometer , ( b ) a unique separation of the radiative component from the ionization component in the dual - readout calorimeter ; and , ( c ) a measurement of the neutron content in the dual - readout fiber calorimeter .",
    "the central tracking system has a resolution of about @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ( gev / c)@xmath14 ) and the muons spectrometer in the annulus between the solenoids with a b=1.5 t field has resolution of about @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ( gev / c)@xmath14 ) .",
    "a muon of momentum @xmath17 which radiates energy @xmath18 in the volume of the calorimeter that is measured with a resolution of @xmath19 will have a momentum - energy balance constraint of @xmath20/p$ ] which yields a rejection of about 30 for a 100 gev muon radiating 20 gev .      a non - radiating muon penetrating the mass of a fiber dual readout calorimeter will leave a signal in the scintillating fibers equivalent to the @xmath21 of the muon , which in dream   is about 1.1 gev .",
    "there will be no erenkov signal since the erenkov angle is larger than the capture cone angle of the fiber .",
    "a radiating muon will add equal signals to both the scintillating and erenkov fibers and , therefore , the difference of the scintillating @xmath22 and erenkov @xmath23 signals is @xmath24 independent of the degree of radiation .",
    "the distributions of @xmath25 _ vs. _",
    "@xmath26 for 20 gev left in the h4 beam at 20 gev / c , so these data are from 40 gev / c @xmath27 . ] and 200 gev @xmath28 and @xmath27 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - pi ] in which for an isolated track the @xmath10 rejection against @xmath3 is about @xmath0 at 20 gev and @xmath29 at 200 gev .",
    "the distribution of @xmath25 as a mean that is very nearly 1.1 gev as expected , and the radiative events are evident at larger @xmath26 .",
    "r0.7          the dream   collaboration has succeeded in the measurement of neutron content in hadronic showers event - by - event in the dream   module by summing the scintillating channels of the module in three radial rings and digitizing the pmt output at 1.25 ghz .",
    "these data , now being analyzed , show clearly the long - time neutron component in hadron showers that is absent in electromagnetic showers ( and also absent in the erenkov fibers of the dream   module for both @xmath2 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "we expect to estimate a neutron fraction , @xmath31 , each event the same way we estimate @xmath32 each event , and be able to reject localized hadronic activity in the calorimeter with factors of 10 - 50 .",
    "any simple product of these three rejection factors , or any estimate of the muon efficiency and purity , gives an optimistic result that will clearly be limited by tracking efficiencies , overlapping shower debris in the calorimeter , or track confusion either in the main tracker or the muon spectrometer before these beam test numbers are reached .",
    "nevertheless , we expect excellent muon identification ."
