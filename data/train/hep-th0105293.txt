    "the smallness of the cosmological constant is an outstanding fine - tuning problem .",

    "in such a scenario@xcite , where the branes are stationary , an exponentially small cosmological constant appears rather naturally .",
    "the scenario also easily incorporates the solution to the hierarchy problem via warped geometry .",

    "this problem is tremendously simplified in the limit of zero brane tension and zero brane charge ( but with a finite non - zero ratio ) .",
    "since the visible brane tension must be smaller than the planck brane tension , we are led to consider the visible brane as a probe brane . in this approximation ,",

    "the stationary branes are unstable : under small perturbations they will start moving . this conclusion is consistent with the result in other similar situations @xcite .",
    "a stationary probe brane is stable if it is sitting at a minimum of the warp factor .",
    "this corresponds to a particle horizon in our scenario . otherwise , an unstable mode is present and a perturbation away from the stationary position will grows like @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the hubble constant .",
    "so a stationary probe brane will start moving , eventually moving at the `` speed of light '' ( an exact solution of the probe brane equation of motion ) .",

    "a small perturabtion will only grow by one e - fold ( say doubling ) in the lifetime of the universe . that is , such an instability is harmless .",
    "we also discuss the implication of this result in the more general and realistic situations .",
    "in particular , the branes should be stabilized with a radion potential@xcite .    to check that there is no back reaction , and as an illustration , we consider explicitly a three @xmath3-brane model , where the visible brane is sitting between the planck brane and a third brane , which is beyond the particle horizon . as the third brane and the planck brane",

    "we also clarify the equivalence of two apparently different ways to obtain the effective 4-d cosmological constant given in ref@xcite : ( i ) via the determination of the hubble constant @xmath1 and ( ii ) via the 4-d effective action . in the latter approach , besides the contributions from the brane tensions and the bulk cosmological constants , the extra dimension curvature also contributes . in the large brane separations case ,",
