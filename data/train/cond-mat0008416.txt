    "single - electron dynamics in the lowest landau level ( lll ) broadened by a delta - correlated scalar disorder potential provides the simplest framework for the analysis of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) .",
    "wegner s exact calculation @xcite of the density of states raised hopes that the corresponding model may be exactly solvable , and much effort was put into understanding transport in this model . however , in contrast to the density of states , the conductivity is expressed in terms of a two - particle green s function and depends not only on the energies of single - particle states , but also on their wave functions .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the single - electron wave functions in a strong magnetic field is delocalization near the centers of the disorder - broadened landau bands . for small energies",
    "@xmath3 counted off from the band center ( in the neglect of band mixing ) , the localization length @xmath4 diverges as a universal power@xcite of @xmath5 .",
    "these are transitions between large - radius states that form the low - frequency conductivity of the system . as a result ,",
    "for fermi energies close to a band center , the model displays a universal critical behavior at sufficiently small temperatures and frequencies .",
    "the width of the critical region depends on the properties of the disorder potential and the landau level number . for the lowest landau level , it is of the order of the bandwidth @xmath6 , the only dimensional parameter of the hamiltonian projected on the lll ( we assume that the cyclotron frequency @xmath7 ) . outside the scaling region , the spatial extent of the eigenstates is small , of the order of the magnetic length @xmath8 , and the universality is lost .",
    "therefore the overall frequency dependence of the conductivity is determined by the disorder mechanism and may allow to discriminate between different mechanisms .",
    "for this reason , it is interesting to obtain the frequency dependence of the conductivity , including its universal and non - universal parts , at least for some basic models of disorder .",
    "it is also of interest to find highly accurate numerical results , as they may be used to test various approximate analytical approaches .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the frequency - dependent conductivity for a short - range disorder potential .",
    "short - range disorder is usually a good model of the random potential experienced by electrons trapped on the surface of liquid helium .",
    "this potential is due to quasistatic ripplons , slow helium vapor atoms , or , for thin helium films , substrate disorder @xcite .",
    "the electron correlations in this system are usually strong .",
    "however , it was believed that , for strong enough magnetic fields , the static magnetoconductivity can be described in the single - electron approximation ( for a review see refs .  ) .",
    "the corresponding results obtained within the self - consistent born approximation@xcite ( scba ) appeared to be in reasonable agreement with the experiment@xcite .",
    "the scba ignores the interference effects which lead to electron localization and to the scaling behavior near the band center .",
    "therefore there is an apparent contradiction between the interpretation of the experimental data on electrons on helium and the phenomenology of the quantum hall effect . from this point of view",
    ", it is important to develop a single - electron theory of magnetotransport that will take localization effects into account and will thus extend the ideas of the iqhe theory to a new parameter range , which is of interest for electrons on helium in particular .",
    "the results can serve as a basis for the full many - electron theory of magnetoconductivity at strong magnetic fields@xcite .    with this in mind",
    ", we will analyze magnetotransport in the regime @xmath9 where the disorder - induced broadening of the lowest landau level is small compared to temperature , and simultaneously the filling fraction is small , , the electron system is nondegenerate .",
    "much of the experimental data on electrons on helium refers to the range ( [ eq : non - degeneracy ] ) , as the system is very clean , and the experiments are often done at low electron densities @xmath10  @xmath11 .",
    "this range is also of interest for low - density electron systems in semiconductors .    in the range ( [ eq : non - degeneracy ] ) all states within a broadened landau level are nearly equally populated , and one no longer needs to take into account the boltzmann factor while computing temperature and disorder averages using the hamiltonian projected on that level . as we show below",

    "the problem of the optimal potential for cyclotron resonance was previously considered by ioffe and larkin@xcite .",
    "they used an ansatz of a rotationally - symmetric optimal potential @xmath209 where @xmath210 are the functions of the lowest and first excited landau levels centered at the _ same _ origin , with magnetic quantum numbers 0 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "this resulted in the asymptotic form of the cyclotron resonance absorption peak @xmath212 , for the range @xmath13 .",

    "the calculation of the tails of the cyclotron resonance absorption peak is very similar to that in sec .",

    "if we neglect the dependence of the transition matrix element on @xmath34 , then for the optimal potential we obtain an equation similar to eq .",
    "( [ larkin_solution ] ) . however , in contrast to ref .  , we permit the centers of the wave functions @xmath216 and @xmath217 to be shifted with respect to each other .",
    "a remarkable feature of this simplified variational problem is that , in the neglect of overlapping of the displaced wave functions , the _ same _ value of the variational functional [ except for the overlap term ] is obtained for the trial wave functions of the first landau level with the magnetic quantum numbers -1 or 0 , , @xmath218 or @xmath219 , or for any their linear combination .    for a displacement @xmath220 between the centers of the hump and well of the optimal potential ,",
    "the transition matrix element is @xmath221 .",

    "as in the case of the low - frequency conductivity , this distance increases as the frequency is tuned away from resonance .",
    "the variational result for the conductivity tail is @xmath223 this tail is much broader , with the exponent reduced by a factor of 3 , compared to the result of ref .  .",
    "generally , we do not expect @xmath224 to display a non - analytic dip at the center of the cyclotron absorption peak .",
    "indeed , the power - law singularity  ( [ eq : scaling - sigma - large - temperature ] ) of the low - frequency conductivity can be associated with quantum interference which leads to eventual localization of all states except for one ( or maybe a few ) at the band center .",
    "the expression  ( [ red_sigma_cyc2 ] ) for the cyclotron resonance absorption has a structure which differs from that for the low - frequency conductivity .",
    "in particular , it contains an extra phase factor from the hamiltonian @xmath195 ( [ eq : perturbation - cyclotron ] ) which represents the difference in the random potential experienced by an electron at the two landau levels .",
    "this phase factor should give rise to an exponential damping , and related suppression of the interference effects at long times .",
    "consequently , the conductivity is expected to be smooth near @xmath225 .    another way to see this",
    "is based on the following arguments .",
    "the suppression of the low - frequency conductivity for @xmath1 may be attributed to level repulsion between overlapping localized states .",

    "indeed , only such states contribute to the low - frequency conductivity , as we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : small - omega ] . on the other hand ,",
    "resonant cyclotron absorption is due to transitions between _ different _ landau levels .",
    "although the central part of the absorption peak is formed by transitions between strongly overlapping states , the involved states are eigenstates of _ different _ hamiltonians , with random parts @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "their wave functions have different spatial structures and their energies are essentially uncorrelated , except for states deep in the tails of the landau levels . consequently",
    ", we expect no suppression of transitions at frequencies close to @xmath225 .",
    "this argument is in agreement with the results of the method of moments presented in the next subsection and fig .",
    "[ fig : cyc_conduct ] .",
