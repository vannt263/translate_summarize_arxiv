    "landau s matching condition allows one to associate the rest - frame densities with their equilibrium values , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "the difference between the isotropic and equilibrium pressures defines the so - called bulk viscosity , @xmath30 .",

    "these quantities represent the dissipative forces in the system as well as deviations from the local thermal equilibrium . in the navier - stokes approximation",
    "they are linearly proportional to the gradients of velocity and temperature , with proportionality coefficients for shear viscosity @xmath34 , bulk viscosity @xmath35 , and charge diffusion @xmath36 quantifying the transport properties of the matter .",
    "it is well known that the bulk viscosity coefficient of a relativistic gas is about three orders of magnitude smaller than its shear viscosity coefficient , and vanishes in the ultrarelativistic limit  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still important for relativistic systems around phase transitions ; therefore , even if the bulk viscosity is negligible in the qgp - phase , it may be large near and below the phase transition  @xcite .",
    "a large bulk viscosity at those stages may or may not have a significant effect on the observables  @xcite .",
    "since disentangling the effects of shear and bulk on the observed spectra is difficult , and beyond the scope of this work , we adopt the approach of ref .",
    "we assume that bulk viscosity is large only in the vicinity of the qcd phase transition but due to the critical slowing down its effect is so small that it can be safely ignored .    at midrapidity",
    "the matter formed in ultrarelativistic collisions at rhic and at the lhc is to a good approximation net - baryon free , and thus in boost - invariant calculations it has been an excellent approximation to neglect all conserved charges .",
    "since in this study we want to investigate the back- and forward rapidity regions of the system where net - baryon density is finite , in principle we should include the net - baryon current and baryon charge diffusion in the description of the system .",
    "however , the baryon charge diffusion in a qgp as well as in a hadron gas is largely unknown at the moment . also , at low values of net - baryon density where the lattice qcd results  @xcite can be used ,",
    "the effect of the finite density on the eos is small  @xcite . therefore , to simplify the description of the system , and to allow us to concentrate solely on the effects of shear viscosity on the spectra",
    ", we ignore the finite baryon charge in the fluid as well .",
    "thus we are left with the shear - stress tensor @xmath31 as the only dissipative quantity in the system .",
    "in so - called second - order or causal fluid - dynamical theories by mller and by israel and stewart  @xcite the dissipative quantities fulfill certain coupled relaxation equations . here",
    "we recall the relaxation equation for the shear - stress tensor obtained from the relativistic boltzmann equation  @xcite , @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the shear - stress relaxation time , @xmath39 denotes the time derivative , @xmath40 the expansion rate , @xmath41 the shear tensor and @xmath42 the vorticity .",
    "the other coefficients can be calculated self - consistently from microscopic theory and , for example , in case of an ultrarelativistic massless boltzmann gas we obtain , in the 14-moment approximation , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , while @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mean free path between collisions .",
    "for qcd these coefficients are mostly unknown ; however , for high - temperature qcd matter the coefficients given above may be acceptable as a first approximation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we ignore the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ relax_shear ] ) .",
    "this is justified since the relative contribution of the @xmath48 coefficient was shown to be negligible compared to the others  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we have observed that the term proportional to the vorticity has little effect on the overall evolution of the system , and is thus omitted from the final calculations shown here .      during the fluid - dynamical evolution",
    "the system cools and dilutes due to the expansion , and consequently the microscopic rescattering rate of particles , @xmath49 , decreases , until the rescatterings cease and particles stream freely toward detectors .",
    "the transition from an ( almost ) equilibrated fluid to free - streaming particles is a gradual process , but since implementing such a gradual process into a fluid - dynamical description is very complicated  @xcite , it is usually assumed to take place on an infinitesimally thin space - time layer , on the so - called freeze - out surface .",
    "therefore the total number of particles crossing the surface @xmath50 , with a normal vector @xmath51 pointing outward , leads to the following invariant distribution of particles emitted from the fluid , known as the cooper - frye formula  @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes the four - momentum , while @xmath54 is the phase - space distribution function of particles on the surface .    to apply the cooper - frye formula",
    ", we need an appropriate criterion for choosing the surface @xmath50 .",
    "since scattering rates strongly depend on temperature , the usual approach is to assume the freeze - out to take place on a surface of constant temperature or energy density .",
    "however , it has been argued that it would be more physical to assume that the freeze - out happens when the average scattering rate is roughly equal to the expansion rate of the system  @xcite .",
    "this latter , so - called dynamical freeze - out , criterion can be expressed in terms of the knudsen number , @xmath55 , which is the ratio of a characteristic microscopic time or length scale , such as @xmath47 , and a characteristic macroscopic scale of the fluid , such as the inverse of the local gradients , @xmath56 . in terms of the knudsen number",
    "the dynamical freeze - out criterion is @xmath57 , which has occasionally been used in ideal fluid calculations  @xcite , but for viscous fluids it is more appropriate to use the relaxation time(s ) of dissipative quantity(ies ) as the microscopic scale , since they appear naturally in the evolution equations for dissipative quantities  @xcite .    in most of our calculations we use the conventional constant - temperature freeze - out , but to evaluate how sensitive our results are to the particular freeze - out criterion , and to the freeze - out description in general , we also do the calculations assuming freeze - out at constant knudsen number .",
    "we take the relaxation time of shear stress , @xmath58 , as the microscopic scale , and the inverse of the expansion rate of the system , @xmath59 , as the macroscopic scale .",
    "thus we get a local knudsen number of @xmath60 since the knudsen number can be evaluated in many different ways  @xcite , we do not insist on freeze - out at @xmath61 , but treat the freeze - out knudsen number as a free parameter chosen to reproduce rapidity and @xmath62 distributions of experimental data . to avoid pathologies encountered in refs .",
    "@xcite , we also require that the dynamical freeze - out takes place below a temperature of @xmath63 mev and above @xmath64 mev .    to evaluate the distributions on the freeze - out surface",
    ", we assume that the distribution of particles for each species @xmath65 , _",

    "@xcite .    because for smooth solutions ( like in our case ) the multidimensional antidiffusion limiter suffers from instabilities around the boundary caused by small ripples propagating into the interior @xcite , we further stabilized shasta by letting the antidiffusion coefficient @xmath296 , which controls the amount of numerical diffusion , be proportional to @xmath297 where @xmath298 is the default value for the antidiffusion coefficient @xcite , @xmath299 is the energy density in the local rest frame , and @xmath300 gev/@xmath301 is a numerical parameter . in this way we increase",
    "the amount of numerical diffusion in the low - density region and @xmath296 goes smoothly to zero near the boundaries of the grid . in our cases of interest",
    "this neither affects the solution nor produces more entropy inside the decoupling surface .",
    "it is also important to mention that in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional case both the conservation and the relaxation equations are solved using shasta , employing the above - mentioned modification for the antidiffusion coefficient .",
    "earlier , for the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional boost - invariant case , we used a simple centered second - order difference algorithm to solve the relaxation equations @xcite .",
    "however doing so in the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional case does not always lead to stable solutions .    to further stabilize the numerical calculations ( and also for ideal fluids )",
    "we used a smaller value for the antidiffusion coefficient in the transverse directions , @xmath302 , but kept @xmath303 in the @xmath7 direction . decreasing the antidiffusion coefficient produces smoother solutions inside the decoupling hypersurface but also increases the numerical diffusion , which in turn may decrease the numerical accuracy",
    "the reason we used a different coefficient in the longitudinal direction is to increase the accuracy ; see the next section for more details .",
    "the numerical calculations are done on a discretized spatial grid ( including four boundary points in each direction as required by the algorithm ) of @xmath304 cells with @xmath305 while @xmath306 with @xmath307 fm cell sizes .",
    "the time step is given from @xmath308 , which for @xmath309 leads to @xmath310 fm/@xmath145 .",
    "furthermore , the system is symmetric around the @xmath311 and @xmath312 directions , with exponentially interpolated boundary conditions for the conserved quantities ( _ e.g. _ ,  for glauber - type initial conditions ) and linearly interpolated boundary conditions for the shear - stress tensor ( because the shear - stress tensor may change sign ) .",
    "finally , the freeze - out hypersurface is constructed at time intervals @xmath313 fm/@xmath145 .",
    "the space is sampled uniformly in both the transverse and longitudinal directions , at @xmath314 fm distances .",
    "the freeze - out hypersurface is calculated using the cornelius++ subroutine presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and its source code can be obtained from the open standard codes and routines ( oscar ) website @xcite .",
    "shasta solves the fluid dynamical equations up to some finite numerical accuracy . in most cases",
    "this means that in cartesian coordinates the particle number and energy are conserved up to @xmath226 accuracy .",
    "however in @xmath315 coordinates the expressions for the conserved quantities as well as the equations of motion change with additional source terms resulting from the nonvanishing christoffel symbols .    as an example",
    "let us evaluate a conserved quantity at a given time or proper time ; hence by comparing this initial value with one at a later time we can follow the accuracy of the fluid - dynamical solver during this time interval .",
    "the total conserved charge @xmath316 across any given hypersurface is@xmath317here the hypersurface element @xmath318 can be specified in any coordinate system according to the following general formula : @xmath319where @xmath320 is the levi - civita symbol .",
    "if we are interested in the conserved current across constant time or proper time hypersurfaces then @xmath328 ; hence in cartesian coordinates we get , @xmath329where @xmath330 is the conserved charge current .",
    "similarly , eq .  ( [ n_tot ] ) leads to the total conserved charge at any proper - time hypersurface in hyperbolic coordinates , @xmath331 to calculate how the total energy - momentum changes between two closed hypersurfaces , first we define the energy - momentum current across a hypersuface as @xmath332 in cartesian coordinates @xmath333 , such that @xmath334 denotes the energy current while @xmath335 denotes the momentum current trough the hypersurface .",
    "therefore the total energy current across a constant-@xmath336 hypersurface is @xmath337    the energy - momentum current across a constant-@xmath224 hypersurface in @xmath324 coordinates can also be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ e_total_current ] ) together with the general transformation rules @xmath338 , where the position vectors are @xmath339 and @xmath340 .",
    "thus the total energy across a constant-@xmath224 hypersurface is given by @xmath341    using the latter formulas we can check energy conservation from the initial time to the end using @xmath342it turns out that by solving the fluid dynamical equations in cartesian coordinates we can achieve @xmath343 numerical accuracy , while in hyperbolic coordinates @xmath344 .",
    "this behavior is due to two different reasons .",
    "first , the numerical algorithm is accurate only to finite precision , meaning that @xmath292 or @xmath345 is calculated correctly only up to the first six digits .",
    "however , due to the hyperbolic functions in eq .",
    "( [ e_tot_tau_eta ] ) the total energy of the system is given by a differently weighted sum over all cells ( compared to cartesian coordinates ) .",
    "these hyperbolic weights increase very rapidly as a function of @xmath7 ; hence even though the numerical error of the solver is acceptably small for shasta , the weighted sum over all cells in hyperbolic coordinates shows otherwise .",
    "we have checked that for rhic energies @xmath346 while at lhc energies this number can be as much as @xmath347 .",
    "this is because @xmath348 is much narrower at rhic than at the lhc .",
    "similar results were also obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using a different computational fluid - dynamical algorithm .",
    "we also verified energy conservation inside the constant - temperature freeze - out hypersurface , and we found that in that case the energy is conserved at @xmath80 accuracy , at both rhic and the lhc .",
    "this was expected since inside the @xmath349 mev freeze - out hypersurface the space - time rapidity of matter is @xmath350 .",
