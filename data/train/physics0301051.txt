    "nonlinear interference effects connected with the atomic ground state coherence are now well known and widely used @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising classes of these effects , especially for precise measurements , is that of super - narrow dark resonances @xcite that appear in the medium s response to bichromatic laser excitation , when the laser frequency difference is close to the atomic ground - state splitting .",
    "the use of vapor cells containing a buffer gas in addition to an alkali vapor has allowed the measurement of resonance linewidths less than 50 hz @xcite . while such resonances have been extensively investigated experimentally ( especially in the case of cs )",
    "@xcite , a detailed theoretical understanding is not yet well developed for realistic multilevel systems , motivating the present work .",
    "our theory was developed in close connection with ongoing efforts to construct compact atomic clocks @xcite and magnetometers @xcite .",
    "for any practical application of dark resonances , the stability and accuracy are optimized with respect to parameters such as the output signal amplitude , width , and shift . in the problem considered here ,",
    "many parameters , such as laser detunings , field component polarizations and amplitudes , and buffer gas pressure , affect the dark resonance itself .",
    "in addition , various excitation schemes ( for example , @xmath0 versus @xmath1 line excitation @xcite ) and different atomic isotopes can be used .",
    "a natural question arises : what design will optimize the performance of the clock ( or magnetometer ) ?",
    "previous theories did not completely answer this question .",
    "one main obstacle was connected with the complicated energy - level structure of the real atomic systems used in experiments .",
    "generally speaking , there are several types of problems in the theoretical description of dark resonances .",
    "one problem relates to a proper treatment of the relaxation processes in the system , including velocity - changing collisions @xcite and the spatial diffusion of coherently prepared atoms @xcite .",
    "light propagation through coherently prepared nonlinear media , especially through optically thick media @xcite , can be thought of as another type of difficulty .",
    "this paper addresses another important problem : that of field - induced processes in multilevel systems such as coherence preparation , optical pumping , ac stark shifts , and power broadening",
    ". all existing theories can be classified into three kinds : few - state models ( basically , three - state lambda systems ) @xcite , perturbation theories @xcite , and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "all three classes of theories have disadvantages .",
    "the first theory neglects many details of the actual configuration of atomic levels .",
    "perturbation theory neglects some effects induced by the presence of the optical field ( namely , optical pumping , ac stark shifts , and power broadening ) .",
    "numerical simulation theories demonstrate a lack of genuine understanding and predictive power .",
    "this paper presents a new analytical theory , that accounts for the level structure ( both zeeman and hyperfine ) of a real atom , as well as all field - induced effects .",
    "the relaxation processes are treated in the simplest way : by neglecting velocity - changing collisions and all effects connected with the spatial inhomogeneity , we reduce the model to one described simply by relaxation constants .",
    "the crucial assumption is total collisional depolarization of the excited state .",
    "in addition , we add the ( optional ) approximations of homogeneous broadening and low saturation . with these approximations ,",
    "a general analytical result is obtained for the atomic response , which result is valid for arbitrary excitation schemes ( @xmath0 as well as @xmath1 lines ) , light field polarizations , and magnetic fields . in the specific case of circularly polarized light in the presence of a magnetic field , where only two states participate in the coherence preparation , analytical lineshapes ( generalized lorentzian ) coincide exactly with the phenomenological model heuristically introduced previously to fit experimental data @xcite . in the case of zero magnetic field , and when contributions of different zeeman sub - states are well overlapped , the resonance lineshape is also approximately described by the generalized lorentzian .",
    "a comparison of analytically calculated coefficients of the lorentz - lorenz model ( with no free parameters ) with coefficients extracted from experimental data demonstrates a good qualitative agreement .",
    "in this section , the general framework of the problem is described , the basic assumptions we make are stated and the specific procedure for calculating the quantities of interest is outlined .",
    "we consider the resonant interaction of alkali atoms in the @xmath2 ground state with a two - frequency laser field @xmath3 + { \\bf e}_2 \\exp[-i(\\omega_2 t - k_2 z ) ]   + c.c . \\;,\\ ] ] where both components propagate in the positive direction ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the field can excite atoms either to the @xmath5 state ( @xmath1 line ) or to the @xmath6 state ( @xmath0 line ) .",
    "two hyperfine ( hf ) components are present in the ground state with the total angular momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the nuclear spin ) .",
    "the hf splitting in the ground state @xmath10 is in the range @xmath11 to @xmath12ghz .",
    "the excited state has two ( @xmath1 line ) or four ( @xmath0 line ) hf levels with the angular momenta @xmath13 and the energies @xmath14 .",
    "the hf splitting of the excited state is typically one order of magnitude smaller than  @xmath15 . to be more specific , we assume that the frequency @xmath16 is close to resonance with the @xmath17 transitions , while the other frequency @xmath18 is close to the frequencies of the @xmath19 transitions .",
    "thus , we have a @xmath20-type excitation scheme ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in the absence of an external b - field",
    ", the hf levels are degenerate with respect to the total angular momentum projections . for the zeeman sub - states the following shorthand notations",
    "will be used : @xmath21 with @xmath22 , and @xmath23 with @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .        for simplicity ,",
    "we consider first an atom at rest , positioned at the origin @xmath26 .",
    "each frequency component of the field can in principal induce transitions from both ground - state hf levels .",
    "then the interaction hamiltonian in the dipole approximation contains contributions of two kinds : @xmath27 where we use a rotating frame ( the unitary transformation of the ground - state basis @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 is the dipole moment operator .",
    "the first term in is independent of time in the rotating basis , and we refer to it as the resonant contribution .",
    "the second term , oscillating at the difference frequency , results in off - resonant contributions to the optical shifts and optical pumping rates , as well as in temporal oscillations of the atomic density matrix .",
    "the role of the off - resonant term in the case of a three - level @xmath20 system has been studied in great detail  @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of the oscillating parts of the density matrix can be approximated as @xmath30 .",
    "for the moderate field intensities considered here ( @xmath31mw/@xmath32 ) this ratio is very small , @xmath33 , and the oscillating terms can be safely neglected .",
    "however , the off - resonant contributions to the optical energy shifts and widths can be significant , especially in the case of large one - photon detunings .",
    "[ oscill ]    the hamiltonian for a free atom in the rotating frame can be written as @xmath34 is the average one - photon detuning , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are measured from a common zero level ( for example , from the hf level with maximal momentum @xmath37 ) , and @xmath38 is the raman ( two - photon ) detuning .",
    "since this paper is concerned with the field - induced effects in multi - level atomic systems , the relaxation processes are modeled by several constants .",
    "the homogeneous broadening of the optical line , due mainly to collisions with a buffer gas , is described by the constant @xmath39 .",
    "we assume that the excited state is completely depolarized due to collisions during the radiative lifetime @xmath40 , i.e. , the depolarization rates @xmath41 obey the condition @xmath42 the relaxation of the ground - state density matrix to the isotropic equilibrium , both due to the diffusion through the laser beam and due to collisions , is modeled by a single constant @xmath43 .    under the assumption of moderate field intensities and high buffer - gas pressure",
    ", we develop the theory in the low - saturation limit : @xmath44 the two - photon dark resonance appears when the raman detuning @xmath45 is scanned around zero .",
    "the width of the dark resonance , which is related to the ground - state relaxation , is usually six orders of magnitude smaller than the optical linewidth @xmath39 .",
    "the approximation @xmath46 is therefore suitable .",
    "it should be stressed that all approximations are well justified for typical experimental conditions .",
    "for example , in the case of cs in a background ne atmosphere at a pressure of @xmath47kpa , the homogeneous broadening @xmath48mhz @xcite of the optical line exceeds the doppler width @xmath49mhz , so velocity - changing collisions are inconsequential .",
    "the collisional depolarization rate @xmath50mhz @xcite is large compared to the inverse radiative lifetime @xmath51mhz .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath52 for the field intensity @xmath53mw/@xmath32 , which results in a saturation parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the two - photon detuning is scanned in the range @xmath55mhz , and the ground - state relaxation rate can be estimated to be @xmath56hz @xcite .    eliminating",
    "optical coherences with these approximations ( for details see the appendix ) , we arrive at the following set of equations for the ground - state density submatrix ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 + \\left(\\frac{\\pi_e}{\\tau_e}+\\gamma\\right)\\,\\frac{\\widehat{\\pi}_g}{n_g } , \\\\",

    "the first term ( @xmath62 ) of the source in corresponds to the isotropic repopulation of the ground - state sublevels due to the spontaneous decay of the excited states .",
    "the other term ( @xmath63 ) describes the entrance of unpolarized atoms due to diffusion and collisions . due to the conservation of the total number of particles ( [ n_cond ] ) ,",
    "separate dynamic equations for the excited - state density matrix elements are not needed .",
    "both the dynamics and steady state are completely governed by the non - hermitian ground - state hamiltonian : @xmath64 here the excitation matrix , @xmath65 } \\langle j , m'| + \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\sum_{i\\neq j , e , m , m'}|i , m\\rangle \\frac{\\langle i , m|{(\\widehat{\\bf d}\\cdot { \\bf e}_j)}^{\\dagger}|e\\rangle \\langle e| ( \\widehat{\\bf d}\\cdot { \\bf e}_j)|i , m'\\rangle } { \\hbar^2\\,[(\\delta_l+\\omega_j-\\omega_i-\\omega_e)+i\\gamma/2 ] } \\langle i , m'|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] contains the resonant ( first summation ) as well as off - resonant ( second summation ) contributions to the optical shifts and optical pumping rates ( hermitian and anti - hermitian parts , respectively ) .",

    "we have scalar ( @xmath71 ) , vector ( @xmath72 ) and quadrupole ( @xmath73 ) contributions .",
    "all possible selection rules are contained in the coefficients of vector coupling , i.e. , the @xmath74 and @xmath75 symbols .    for an atom moving along the direction of propagation of the optical field ,",
    "the field frequencies are shifted due to the doppler effect : @xmath76 . as a result ,",
    "a doppler shift of the one - photon detuning @xmath77 occurs , where @xmath78 , as does a residual doppler shift of the raman detuning @xmath79 . at high buffer - gas pressure",
    "the residual doppler shift is suppressed due to the lamb - dicke effect @xcite .",
    "however , in the general case the doppler shift of the one - photon detuning can be significant , and certain quantities must be averaged over the maxwell velocity distribution .",
    "nevertheless , for buffer - gas pressures typically used in experiments , the approximation of homogeneous broadening is reasonable as a first approach to the problem , because the homogeneous width @xmath39 equals or even exceeds the doppler width @xmath80 .",
    "here we consider the steady - state regime , setting @xmath81 in . as a spectroscopic signal ,",
    "we consider the total excited - state population @xmath61 , which is proportional to the total light absorption in optically thin media or to the total fluorescence .",
    "the following procedure is used to find @xmath61 . from , the ground - state density matrix @xmath82 is expressed in terms of @xmath61 , and then @xmath61 is calculated from the normalization condition . the solution of this algebraic problem can be obtained in a compact analytical form in two important special cases . the first arises when both field components have the same simple ( circular or linear ) polarization and there is no magnetic field .",
    "here , for a suitable choice of the quantization axis , the excitation matrix @xmath83 contains only diagonal elements with respect to the magnetic quantum number , i.e. , @xmath84 in .",
    "the second case appears when a magnetic field is applied and just a few substates contribute to the raman coherence for arbitrary light polarizations and arbitrary magnetic field directions .",
    "both cases are considered below .",
    "we turn now to the case of circular field polarization when the quantization axis is directed orthogonal to the polarization vector ( or alternatively linear polarization when the quantization axis is aligned along the polarization vector ) .",
    "we evaluate the total excited - state population , @xmath61 , in order to determine how the dark resonance signal ( proportional to @xmath61 ) depends on parameters such as the optical detuning from resonance . under these assumptions , the complete set of equations ( [ maineq ] ) can be split into independent blocks for each magnetic quantum number @xmath85 ( @xmath85-blocks ) . these blocks for @xmath86 contain only one equation for the sub - state population @xmath87 .",

    "the full equation set for the ground - state density matrix elements must be solved , including all possible zeeman and raman coherences . nevertheless , one important exception should be noted .",
    "if the optical linewidth is much greater than the excited - state hf splitting @xmath110 , the quadrupole contributions to @xmath83 are negligible @xcite .",
    "the vector terms are diagonal ( with respect to the magnetic quantum number ) in the coordinate frame with @xmath111 as the quantization axis , since @xmath112 \\propto { \\bf e}_z$ ] .",
    "thus , we return to the case discussed above .",
    "in a weak magnetic field , the ground - state magnetic sublevels are split due to the linear zeeman effect , which can be described by the following additional term in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) : @xmath113 are the zeeman splitting frequencies , with @xmath114 the bohr magneton and @xmath115 the magnetic flux density .",
    "the @xmath116-factors of levels , @xmath117 , are expressed through the electronic @xmath118 and nuclear @xmath119 lande factors : @xmath120 the magnetic field causes a precession of atomic coherences with frequencies @xmath121 . when the zeeman frequencies are much larger than off - diagonal elements of the excitation matrix @xmath122 , the light - induced zeeman coherences within the @xmath123-th hf level are negligible .",
    "thus , we again have a set of independent two - level systems , consisting of the sub - states @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( where @xmath126 due to the selection rules ) . the formulas ( [ pim ] ) and ( [ abcde ] ) for the total block population are still valid for every @xmath127-block with the following substitutions : @xmath128    if the zeeman frequencies significantly exceed the widths @xmath129 , the zeeman - split dark resonances are well resolved .",
    "in other words , the raman coherence between the substates @xmath124 and @xmath125 is effectively induced when the precession frequency is approximately equal to the raman detuning : @xmath130 .",
    "this condition can be simultaneously satisfied for only a few @xmath127-blocks .",
    "more precisely , the nuclear lande factor is typically three orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic lande factor ( for cesium @xmath131 ) ; then , with good accuracy , @xmath132 and the zeeman shift of the dark resonance position is proportional to the sum of magnetic quantum numbers @xmath133 .",
    "it can be seen that , in the general case , three blocks @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 contribute to the coherence preparation for the resonances with even shifts @xmath137 , and two other blocks @xmath138 and @xmath139 contribute for the resonances with odd shifts @xmath140 .",

    "a further increase of the magnetic field causes the dark resonances to be eventually split into individual peaks , corresponding to each @xmath127-block @xcite .",
    "we now consider the dark resonance lineshape in more detail .",
    "first , we analyze the particular case in which just two sub - states @xmath147 and @xmath148 participate in the raman coherence , i.e. , we consider the magnetically insensitive resonance ( @xmath149 ) in a magnetic field .",
    "this @xmath150 resonance is of primary interest for possible clock applications @xcite , because it is only sensitive to a magnetic field in second order . here",
    "the absorption signal , @xmath151 , has the form : @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the total population of the @xmath154-block per unit repopulation rate ( see and ) .",
    "since @xmath153 is a quotient of polynomials of second order in @xmath45 , the absorption can be written as the sum of an absorptive and a dispersive lorentzian , and a constant background : @xmath155 the parameters in are expressed in terms of the coefficients introduced by in the following way .",
    "the dark resonance position is governed by the optical shifts and an additional term caused by the two - photon coupling between levels : @xmath156 the width of dark resonance reads @xmath157 the amplitudes of the symmetrical and antisymmetrical lorentzians are found from the relations @xmath158 the background constant , @xmath159 , corresponds to the absorption far off the two - photon resonance .",
    "the result for the resonance lineshape is quite general .",
    "in fact , it does not depend on our simplified assumptions on the relaxation processes but is valid also in the low - saturation limit for arbitrary relaxation matrix , whenever only two states participate in the coherence preparation and @xmath160 .    turning to the case of zero magnetic field and simple field polarization ,",
    "we proceed with the goal of determining the resonance position , width and amplitudes of the symmetrical and asymmetrical components as above .",
    "since all zeeman levels within a given hyperfine level are now degenerate , we rewrite the repopulation rate @xmath142 as : @xmath161^{-1 } \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath162 does not depend on @xmath45 and corresponds to the absorption far off the two - photon resonance ; the sum of the variable parts of the @xmath85-block populations @xmath163 is expressed through the average over @xmath85-blocks , where the average of a variable @xmath164 is defined as : @xmath165 since @xmath163 is a quotient of polynomials of second order : @xmath166 the average @xmath167 is a quotient of polynomials of order @xmath168 .",
    "generally this average describes a superposition of resonances with different widths and positions due to the @xmath85-dependent power broadening and ac stark shifts , but if the laser detuning is not too large , @xmath169 , all resonances are well overlapped , and the average @xmath170 can be approximated by a quotient of polynomials of second order .",
    "here we use the following simple procedure , where the average of a quotient is substituted by a quotient of the averages : @xmath171 and where the correction factor @xmath172 is chosen such that the exact and approximate expressions coincide at @xmath173 , i.e. , @xmath174 our approximation for @xmath142 yields an error less than a few percent across a wide range of parameters . with this approximation",
    ", we return to the resonance lineshape ( [ llc ] ) , where the parameters are expressed in terms of the averages over @xmath85 : @xmath175",
    "the analytical lineshape coincides exactly with the phenomenological model heuristically introduced previously to fit experimental data @xcite . in those experiments a vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser ( vcsel )",
    "was modulated at the 9.2-ghz hyperfine splitting frequency of the cesium atom , so that the laser output spectrum contained modulation sidebands at this frequency . using the carrier and one of the sidebands the dark resonance could be prepared and spectroscopically observed , as a function of the detuning  @xmath35 of the laser frequency from optical resonance .",
    "data was taken for three different power ratios of carrier and sideband , with the cesium atoms contained in a cell with 8.7kpa of neon as a buffer gas .",

    "this is found to be @xmath213 each of these three quantities , @xmath214 , @xmath211 and @xmath179 , could be considered the resonance center , depending on how the resonance is measured experimentally . in the general asymmetrical case , when @xmath215 ( non - zero effective one - photon detuning ) and @xmath216 ( unbalanced optical pumping rates ) , all three values are different .",
    "even their behavior versus @xmath35 are qualitatively different ( fig .",

    "this last term can be considered as a source , because it is proportional to @xmath82 : @xmath244 the structure of the collisional term @xmath245 can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we simply recall that during the course of a collision only the electronic component of the atomic polarization is depolarized .",
    "the nuclear component is involved in the process of depolarization due to the hf coupling . for all alkali atoms ,",
    "the excited - state hf splitting @xmath246 is much greater than radiative decay rate @xmath247 .",
    "in addition we assume that the collisional relaxation rates @xmath41 for the excited - state electronic multipole moments of rank @xmath248 also obey the conditions @xmath249 ( for @xmath250 we assume @xmath251 , i.e. the collision - induced transitions between the fine structure components are not considered here ) .",
    "in this limit , @xmath252 and @xmath249 , the steady - state solution of has particularly simple form : @xmath253 which corresponds to total collisional depolarization of the excited state .",
    "here we shall illustrate this fact in one specific case , when the excited - state hf splitting is much larger than the depolarization rates @xmath41 and when all the depolarization rates ( except for @xmath254 ) are the same ( so - called pure electronic randomization model @xcite ) . if @xmath255 , one can neglect hf coherence in the excited state .",
    "for pure electronic randomization both eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the liouvillian @xmath256 are well - known @xcite , which allows us to write the steady - state solution of for arbitrary @xmath257 : @xmath258 here the source has the form @xmath259 the relaxation rates @xmath260 \\;;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; l=0,\\ldots , 2i+1\\ ] ] correspond to the zeeman projections of the nuclear multipole moments of rank  @xmath261 @xcite ; and the wigner tensorial operators are defined as @xmath262 as is seen from the rates @xmath263 are of the order of @xmath41 apart from @xmath264 .",

    "thus , we see that in the case of total collisional depolarization of the excited state , when the excited - state density matrix is proportional to @xmath269 [ as shown in ] , is reduced to . in addition , the expression for the optical coherence matrix allows one to calculate various spectroscopic signals ( as well as the total absorption ) , for example , the total dispersion ."
