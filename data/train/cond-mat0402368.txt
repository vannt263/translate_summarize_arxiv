    "ever since the concept of entanglement was introduced , @xcite it has been at the heart of conceptual discussions in quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite the discussions have mainly concerned the non - local properties of entanglement .",
    "two entangled , spatially separated particles , an einstein - podolsky - rosen @xcite ( epr ) pair , are correlated in a way which can not be described by a local , realistic theory , i.e. the correlations give rise to a violation of a bell inequality.@xcite in optics , the non - local properties of entangled pairs of photons have been intensively investigated over the last decades.@xcite recently , the interest has turned to possible applications making use of the properties of entangled particles .",
    "entanglement plays an important role in many quantum computation and information schemes,@xcite with quantum cryptography@xcite and quantum teleportation@xcite as prominent examples .    compared to optics ,",
    "the investigation of entanglement in solid state systems is only in it s infancy .",
    "however , a controlled creation , manipulation and detection of entanglement is a pre - requisite for a large - scale implementation of quantum computation and information schemes , making it of large interest to pursue the investigation of entanglement in solid state systems .",
    "considerable experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite progress has already been made in the understanding of entangled qubits implemented with josephson junctions .",
    "for the entanglement of individual electrons , recently several important steps towards an experimental realization in mesoscopic conductors were taken . a scheme for entanglement of orbital degrees of freedom",
    "was proposed in ref .",
    "[ ] , allowing for control of the entanglement with experimentally accessible electronic beam - splitters .",
    "@xcite moreover , several proposals @xcite for detecting entanglement via a violation of a bell inequality , expressed in terms of zero - frequency noise correlators , @xcite have been put forth . very recently , following a proposal by beenakker _",
    "et al _ [ ] , several works have discussed the possibility of electron - hole and post - selected electron - electron entanglement .",
    "@xcite in particular , entanglement in the electrical analog of the optical hanbury brown twiss effect @xcite was investigated in a mesoscopic conductor in the quantum hall regime , transporting electrons along single edge - states and using quantum point contacts as beam - splitters.@xcite moreover , a scheme for energy - time entanglement@xcite has been proposed.@xcite the consequences of dephasing for orbital entanglement have been investigated @xcite as well .",
    "earlier proposals for electronic entanglement have been based on creating and manipulating spin entanglement , in normal @xcite as well as in normal - superconducting@xcite systems .",
    "spins in semiconductors have been shown@xcite to have dephasing times approaching microseconds , making spins promising candidates for carriers of quantum information .",
    "however , a direct detection of spin entanglement in mesoscopic conductors is difficult .",
    "the natural quantity to measure is the electrical charge current . to investigate spin current",
    ", one thus in principle has to convert the spin current to charge current via e.g. spin - filters . although efficient spin - filters @xcite have very recently been realized experimentally,@xcite there are considerable remaining experimental complications in manipulating and detecting individual spins on a mesoscopic scale .",
    "in particular , to detect the entanglement by a violation of a bell inequality , one needs @xcite two spin filters with independent and locally controllable directions to mimic the polarizers in optical schemes . @xcite    an alternative idea to detect spin entanglement was proposed by burkard , loss and sukhorukov [ ] and also discussed qualitatively by oliver , yamaguchi and yamamoto [ ] .",
    "they proposed to use the relation between the spin and orbital part of the wavefunction , imposed by the antisymmetry of the total wavefunction under exchange of two particles .",
    "a state with an antisymmetric , singlet spin wavefunction has a symmetric orbital wavefunction and vice versa for the spin triplet . when colliding the electrons in a beam - splitter , spin singlets and triplets show a bunching and anti - bunching behavior respectively .",
    "these different bunching behaviors were found to be detectable via the electrical current correlations , i.e. the properties of the orbital wavefunction were used to deduce information about the spin state .",
    "this approach was later extended to all moments of the current.@xcite moreover , it was recently further elaborated in ref .",
    "[ ] , taking spin dephasing and non - ideal beam - splitters into account .    in comparison to detecting spin entanglement via a violation of a bell inequality , the approach of ref .",
    "[ ] however has a fundamental limitation .",
    "the antisymmetric spin singlet is an entangled state , while symmetric , triplet spin states are not neccesarily entangled .",
    "considering e.g. the standard singlet - triplet basis , only one of the three triplets @xmath0 and @xmath1 is spin entangled .",
    "however , all spin - triplet states , having the same symmetrical orbital wavefunction , give rise to the same anti - bunching behavior in the current correlators.@xcite as a consequence , in contrast to a bell inequality test , the approach of ref .",
    "[ ] can not be employed to distinguish between entangled and non - entangled triplet states . to be able to distinguish between different triplet state",
    ", one would need to consider more involved schemes , implementing in addition e.g. single spin rotations .",
    "@xcite    despite this fundamental limitation , the approach of ref .",
    "[ ] is due to its comparable simplicity still of interest for entanglers emitting non - local spin - singlets .",
    "however , the investigations in ref .",
    "[ ] were carried out assuming a discrete spectrum of the electrons and a mono - energetic entangled state incident on the beam - splitter .",
    "while giving a qualitatively correct picture of the physics , it does not quantitatively describe the situation in a conductor connected to electronic reservoirs , where the spectrum is continuous and the entangled electrons generally have a wave - packet nature , i.e. the wavefunction is a linear superposition of entangled electrons at different energies .",
    "@xcite moreover , the wavefunction in ref .",
    "[ ] was not derived considering a specific entangler , it was instead taken to be an incoming plane wave with unity amplitude .",
    "this makes the calculated current correlations inapplicable to most of the entanglers considered theoretically , @xcite which operate in the tunneling regime and emit entangled states with a low amplitude .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the approach of detection of spin - singlet entanglement presented in ref .",
    "the abovementioned shortcomings are bypassed by treating the entangler and the beam - splitter within a unified theoretical framework . as a source of non - local spin - singlets , the superconductor - quantum dot entangler ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) investigated in detail by recher , sukhorukov and loss in ref .",
    "[ ] , is considered . using a formal scattering approach ,",
    "the wavefunction of the electrons emitted from the entangler is calculated .",
    "it is found to be a linear superposition of pairs of spin - entangled electrons at different energies , a two electron wavepacket , similar to what was found for the superconducting orbital entangler in ref .",
    "the amplitude at each energy depends on the position of the single particle levels in the dots .",
    "both the process where the electrons tunnel through different dots , creating the desired non - local epr - pair , as well as the unwanted process when both electrons tunnel through the same dot , are investigated .",
    "in both cases the spin wavefunction is a singlet , preserving the spin - state of the cooper pair tunneling out of the superconductor , however the orbital states are different .",
    "the electrons emitted by the entangler are then collided in a beam - splitter and detected in two electronic reservoirs . due to the singlet spin state ,",
    "electrons tunneling through different dots show a bunching behavior when colliding in the beam - splitter .",
    "both the auto and cross correlations between currents flowing into the normal reservoirs ( but not the average current ) depend on the degree of bunching .",
    "we find that the bunching is proportional to the wavefunction overlap of the two colliding electrons .",
    "this overlap depends strongly on the position of the single - particle levels in the dot , being maximal for both levels aligned with the chemical potential of the superconductors .",
    "the part of the current correlators sensitive to bunching is of the same magnitude as the part insensitive to bunching , making an experimental detection of the spin - singlet entanglement feasible .",
    "the current correlators are independent of scattering phases and thus insensitive to orbital dephasing .",
    "however spin dephasing generally leads to a mixed spin state with a finite fraction of triplets .",
    "since the spin triplets have a tendency to anti - bunch , the spin dephasing results in a reduction of the overall bunching behavior and eventually , for strong spin - dephasing , to a cross - over to an anti - bunching behavior .",
    "a simple expression for the concurrence , quantifying the entanglement in the presence of spin dephasing , is derived in terms of the fano factors .    for electrons tunneling through the same dot , the wavefunction is a linear superposition of states for the pair tunneling through dots 1 and 2 .",
    "both the cross- and auto correlators contain a two - particle interference term , sensitive to the position of the single - particle levels in the dots , however in a different way than the bunching dependent term for tunneling through different dots .",
    "in particular , the correlators depend on the scattering phases , providing a way to distinguish between the two tunneling processes by modulating e.g. the the aharonov - bohm phase.@xcite moreover , the phase dependence makes the correlators sensitive to orbital dephasing , while the spin part of the wavefunction is insensitive to dephasing .",
    "a schematic picture of the system is shown in fig . [ fig1 ] .",
    "a superconducting ( s ) electrode is connected to quantum dots ( 1 and 2 ) via tunnel barriers .",
    "the dots are further contacted , via normal leads to a controllable single - mode electronic beam - splitter @xcite characterized by the forward scattering amplitudes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the arms going out from the beam - splitter are connected to normal electron reservoirs a and b.    we first concentrate on a description of the entangler , the superconductor - quantum dot part of the structure in fig . [ fig1 ] , investigated in great detail in ref .",
    "the entangler was also recently examined within a density matrix approach .",
    "@xcite the role of the beam - splitter is discussed further below , after a discussion of the quantum state emitted by the entangler . to simplify our presentation we carry over the notation from ref .",
    "[ ] when nothing else is stated .",
    "an energy diagram of the superconductor - quantum dot - normal lead part of the structure is shown in fig . [ fig1b ] .",
    "a negative bias @xmath4 is applied to the normal reservoirs while the superconductor is grounded .",
    "the chemical potential of the superconductor is taken as a reference energy , @xmath5 , giving the chemical potential of both normal reservoirs @xmath6 .",
    "each dot 1 and 2 contain a single , spin - degenerate level in the energy range @xmath4 to @xmath7 , with energy @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the level spacing in the dots is assumed to be much larger than the applied bias , so no other levels of the dots participate in the transport .",
    "the temperature is much lower than the applied bias ( but much larger than the kondo temperature ) .",
    "the tunnel barriers between the dots and the superconductor are much stronger than the tunnel barriers between the dots and the normal leads . as a consequence ,",
    "the broadening @xmath10 of the levels in the dots ( taken the same for both dots ) results entirely from the coupling to the normal leads .",
    "the voltage is applied such that the entire broadened resonances are well within the bias window , i.e. @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the quantum dots are in the coulomb blockade regime , i.e. it costs a charging energy @xmath13 to put two electrons on the same dot .",
    "the ground state contains an even number of electrons in the lower lying levels , i.e. anti - ferromagnetic filling of the dots .",
    "the transport takes place as cooper pairs tunnel from the superconductor , through the dots and out into the normal leads . due to the dominating tunnel barrier at the dot - superconductor interface , one pair that tunneled onto the dots",
    "leaves the dots well before the next pair tunnels .",
    "there are two distinct possibilities for the cooper pair to tunnel from the superconductor to the normal leads , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1c ] :    * i , the pair splits and one electron tunnels through each dot , 1 and 2 . *",
    "ii , both electrons tunnel through the same dot , 1 or 2 .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "[ ] that under the conditions stated above , all other tunneling processes could be neglected .",
    "the process i creates the wanted epr - pair , a spin singlet state with the two electrons spatially separated .",
    "however , in an experiment one can not a priori exclude the second , unwanted process , ii .",
    "one thus has to investigate process ii as well , to provide criteria for an unambiguous experimental identification of emission of epr - pairs .    the first process , i , with the two electrons tunneling through different dots , is suppressed below the single particle tunneling probability squared , since the two electrons have to leave the superconductor from two spatially separated points , i.e. effectively breaking up the cooper pair . the tunneling amplitude for a ballistic , three dimensional superconductor@xcite is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the distance between the superconductor - dot connection points , @xmath16 the fermi wave number in the superconductor and @xmath17 the superconducting coherence length .",
    "this amplitude is in general larger for lower dimensional @xcite and disordered @xcite superconductors .",
    "an investigation of the dependence of @xmath18 on the geometry of the contacts to the superconductor was performed in refs . [ ] .",
    "we point out that ways to avoid the suppression due to pair breaking by means of additional dots have been discussed in a similar context in ref .",
    "[ ] . however , since more dots complicate the calculation as well as the experimental realization , we consider the simpler geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    the second process , ii , with both electrons tunneling through the same dot , is suppressed by the coulomb blockade in the dots , as @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , there is a process which avoids double occupancy of the dots but instead requires a pair breaking , leading to suppression of the order @xmath20 .",
    "together , this gives an amplitude @xmath21 .",
    "the exact expression for the constants @xmath18 and @xmath22 in terms of tunnel amplitudes between the dots and the superconductor and the dots and the leads can be found in ref .",
    "[ ] , for our purposes these expressions are not necessary .",
    "we point out that possibles candidates for experimental realization of the proposed system are the extensively investigated@xcite heterostructures with semiconductors contacted to metallic superconducting electrodes .",
    "electron transport through double dots in semiconductor systems have been recently been reviewed , @xcite with an emphasis on experimental advances .",
    "to calculate the wavefunction of the electrons emitted from the superconductor - quantum dot entangler , we employ the formal scattering theory @xcite with the lippman - schwinger equation expressed in terms of the transfer matrix ( t - matrix ) .",
    "the total hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the hamiltonian of the superconductor , the quantum dots , and the normal leads .",

    "the eigenenergy of the state @xmath39 , i.e. the total energy of the individual particles , is @xmath41 .",
    "this gives an expression for the state @xmath42 in the system under consideration , all relevant matrix elements@xcite @xmath43 are analytic in the upper part of the complex energy plane . as a consequency , in the integration over energies of the individual particles in @xmath39 ,",
    "the pole arising from the denominator @xmath44 can be replaced by a @xmath45-function , imposing a total energy @xmath46 , equal to the chemical potential energy of the superconductor .",
    "this gives the wavefunction @xmath47 it was shown in ref .",

    "depending on the relation between the amplitudes @xmath18 and @xmath22 , the transport of the two electrons through the same ( process ii ) or different ( process i ) dots dominates .",

    "to arrive at eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) we first introduced the wavefunctions @xmath72 $ ] , @xmath73 , the spin spinors @xmath74 and the orbital spinors @xmath75 and then performed the integral over energy .",
    "the orbital spinors describe the wavefunction in the space formed by the lead indices 1 and 2 , a pseudo - spin space , as discussed in ref .",
    "we note that the beam - splitter , discussed below , only act in the orbital 12-space ( i.e. spin independent scattering ) .",
    "moreover , it is the property of the state in 12-space that determines the current correlators discussed below .    as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ state1 ] ) , the state is a direct product state between the spin and orbital part of the wavefunction .",
    "the spin state is antisymmetric under exchange of the two electrons , a singlet , while the orbital state is symmetric , a triplet .",
    "the probability to jointly detect one electron at @xmath76 in lead 1 and one at @xmath77 in lead 2 decay exponentially with the distance @xmath78 , an effect of the two electrons being emitted at essentially the same time ( separated by a small time @xmath79 ) to points @xmath80 and @xmath81 respectively .",
    "note that the state @xmath82 , a stationary scattering state , does not describe wave packets in the traditional sense with two electrons moving out from the dots as time passes ( as a solution to the time independent many particle schrdinger equation , @xmath82 has a trivial time dependence ) . to obtain such a wavefunction , one must break time translation invariance by introducing a time dependent perturbation , e.g. a variation of the tunnel barrier strength or dot - level energies in time .    in this context",
    "it is worth to mention that such a time dependent wavefunction was recently considered by hu and das sarma [ ] for a double - dot turnstile entangler .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "[ ] , the entangled wavefunction was not derived from a microscopic calculation but merely postulated .",
    "the wavefunction had an amplitude of order unity ( no tunneling limit ) and contained a double integral over energy .",
    "this is different from our wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ asymptotics1 ] ) and moreover gives rise to a qualitatively different result for the currents as well as the current correlators studied below .",

    "[ ] , where a scattering approach based on the bogoliubov - de gennes equation was used .",
    "this shows rigorously that the effect of the strong coulomb blockade , prohibiting two electrons to tunnel through the same dot , can be incorporated in a scattering formalism by putting the amplitude for andreev reflection back into the same dot to zero . from this observation",
    "it follows that the rest of the calculation in the paper where the state in eq .",
    "( [ asymptotics1 ] ) is employed could in principle be carried out strictly within the scattering approach @xcite to the bogoliubov de gennes equation . however , in such a calculation the entanglement is not directly visible , which makes the interpretation of the result difficult . instead , below we work directly with the state in eq .",
    "( [ asymptotics1 ] ) .",
    "third , it is also interesting to note the close connection between the emission of a cooper pair and the process of spontaneous , parametric down - conversion@xcite of pairs of photons investigated in optics , where a single photon from a pump - laser is split in a non - linear crystal into two photons . from the point of view of the theoretical approach ,",

    "moreover , the emission of the two electrons is `` spontaneous '' , i.e. random and uncorrelated in time , just in the same way as for the down - converted photons .",
    "one can also point out the maybe less obvious relation that the two electrons emitted from the superconductor carry information about the phase of the superconducting condensate , just as the two photons carry information of the phase of the field of the pump - laser .",
