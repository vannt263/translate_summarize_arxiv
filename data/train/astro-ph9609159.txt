    "the w. m. keck telescope has opened up unprecedented opportunities for the study of extremely faint , distant galaxies .",
    "deep imaging with keck is a highly economical and efficient mode of probing the properties of faint field galaxies , and can yield clues for the evolution of galaxies and cosmology . studying galactic evolution by this method",
    "is best done with `` blank '' fields which avoid obvious influence from environmental effects ( such as in clusters of galaxies ) , and at high galactic latitudes , so that local galactic extinction and contamination by foreground stars are both minimized .",
    "we address the classical topic of the number - magnitude relation ( `` number counts '' ) , the differential number of galaxies per apparent magnitude per square degree .",
    "the number - magnitude relation in the near infrared ( in particular in the @xmath0-band at @xmath21 ) is particularly useful , because the rest - frame spectral energy distributions of galaxies are known , and the cosmological k - corrections are quite small out to @xmath22 and more nearly independent of galaxy morphological type than in optical bandpasses .",
    "multi - color photometry allows for a reasonably detailed comparison with models of galactic evolution while being much cheaper to do than spectroscopy . combining optical with near",
    "infrared imaging offers several advantages .",
    "we have combined extremely deep @xmath0-band imaging , obtained with the keck telescope , with extremely deep optical @xmath1- and @xmath2-band imaging , obtained with the new technology telescope ( ntt ) , to study the colors of faint field galaxies . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations and the characteristics of the data , and give details of the @xmath0-band data reductions . in section 3",
    "we present how the aperture corrections and the completeness corrections are determined and applied to produce the @xmath0-band galaxy counts .",
    "the color diagrams , their features , and a grid of isochrone synthesis galaxy evolutionary models that are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "conclusions to these data and the model considerations are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the optical @xmath1- and @xmath2-band data were obtained with the ntt , a 3.5-m active - optics telescope in la silla on 1991 march and 1991 april .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of galaxies in these images are 27  mag  arcsec@xmath6 at 3@xmath23 in both @xmath1 and @xmath2 in more than @xmath24  s integration in each bandpass .",
    "the typical seeing in the data is better than @xmath25  arcsec .",
    "these data and the related science are discussed by peterson et al .",
    "( 1996 ; hereafter p96 ) .",
    "near infrared @xmath0-band ( @xmath21 ) data were obtained with the near infrared camera ( nirc ) on the w. m. keck 10-m telescope , on 1994 february 23 and 24 ( moustakas et al .",
    "the detector array used in nirc is an insb ( indium - antimonide ) photovoltaic @xmath26 square array with @xmath27 square pixels ( matthews & soifer 1994 ) .",
    "the resulting pixel scale is @xmath28  arcsec  pix@xmath29 .",
    "the weather was clear , with the seeing varying from @xmath30  arcsec to @xmath31  arcsec by the end of the second night , due to strong winds . because the sky brightness is quite high in the @xmath0-band ( @xmath32  mag  arcsec@xmath6 ) , individual exposures were short .",
    "because of the excellent control of the thermal background emission at keck , there was no signal to noise advantage in using a @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ; wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) filter .",
    "a typical nirc frame consisted of eight consecutive in - place exposures of @xmath35  s ( @xmath36  s ) .",
    "two widely separated fields , which will be called `` field i '' ( figures 1 and 3 [ plate 1 ] ) and `` field ii '' ( figures 2 and 4 [ plate 2 ] ) , were observed .",
    "both are `` blank '' fields at high galactic latitude ( @xmath37 ) , and are subsections of the optical ntt fields ( p96 ) .",
    "coordinates for the field centers are given in table 1 .",
    "both fields were observed with a @xmath38 mosaic pattern , with a small ( @xmath17  arcsec ) overlap .",
    "the centers of each quadrant in the mosaic pattern are separated by @xmath39  arcsec , making the total field of view approximately @xmath40 for each field . between each set of eight exposures ,",
    "the telescope was moved using a non - redundant pattern in both @xmath41 directions , within @xmath42  arcsec in either direction . with this observing plan",
    ", objects on the sky are imaged on different parts of the array , and the data images can be used for the sky - subtraction and the flatfielding .",
    "the resultant integration time ( and therefore the signal to noise ) varies across each field , and must be accounted for in the analysis of these frames .",
    "individual objects are detected based on a number of contiguous pixels having intensities some factor higher than the local sky .",
    "thus , for the purpose of detecting objects , an `` effective sky '' is specified as follows . because signal to noise is proportional to the square root of the integration time , the final mosaics for the two fields are each multiplied by the _ square root _ of the corresponding exposure map images .",
    "this operation forces the rms-``sky '' to have the same value at all points in the mosaics , making it fair to use a single set of criteria to search for objects over the entire mosaic .",
    "for field i , the time spent on each of the four pointings was @xmath43  s , reaching approximately @xmath44  mag  arcsec@xmath6 at 3@xmath23 in an aperture of 0.9 arcsec diameter . for field",
    "ii , the time spent on two of the four pointings was @xmath45  s , reaching approximately @xmath46  mag  arcsec@xmath6 at 3@xmath23 in the same aperture .",
    "there was not enough time in the observing run to finish all four pointings of field ii .",
    "this is quite apparent in figure 4 ( plate 2 ) , where the signal to noise of the @xmath0-band image is much worse for the two neglected pointings . in the analysis of section 3 we only consider the two deeper pointings of field ii .",
    "guiding with nirc is accomplished via an offset guider camera .",
    "unfortunately , only a single guiding star was available for each field .",
    "nirc and its offset guider have a fixed relative orientation , which can be rotated relative to the instrument s axis .",
    "thus it was necessary for two of the frames in each mosaic to be rotated by a small angle ( @xmath47 ) with respect to the other two .",
    "this relative rotation is apparent in figures 3 ( plate 1 ) and 4 ( plate 2 ) .",
    "although there are no bright stellar objects in any of the pointings to use for stacking , all exposures were guided , so the offsets as recorded at the telescope were used to construct the final coadded mosaics .",
    "individual frames were shifted by the amount specified by the recorded offsets , down to the corresponding fractional - pixel amount .",
    "the resulting mosaics using the fractional - pixel shifts were found to be rather indistinguishable from mosaics that used integer pixel shifts .",
    "also , the accuracy of the offsets seems to be reliable .",
    "to satisfy ourselves that this was the case , we experimented with a cross - correlation technique for refining the offsets , as follows . first , the mosaics were created as described above .",
    "then , each individual image was placed in the correct location on top of the mosaic .",
    "a cross - correlation was calculated based on small offsets of the individual image with respect to its original position ; in all cases , the `` refined '' offsets were practically identical to the original ( recorded ) offsets .",
    "it should be noted that for many of the individual frames , there may not have been sufficient signal in individual objects to calculate reliable refined offsets . to establish the photometric zeropoint ,",
    "the ukirt faint @xmath48 standard star fs14 was observed ( casali & hawarden 1994 ) , and the frames were reduced in the same manner as the primary target frames .      in the @xmath0-band the sky brightness varies quite rapidly , and since we are exploring levels fainter than a part in @xmath49 of the sky brightness , it is crucial to do the sky subtraction carefully . the procedure for reducing the @xmath0-band images",
    "is described below .",
    "all images are dark - subtracted and linearized ( graham 1995 ) .",
    "pixels that saturate at very low intensity levels are marked as bad pixels , and are included in a bad - pixel mask .",
    "we proceed with a crude sky subtraction for each frame by creating a median - average frame of the five ( temporally ) nearest frames , where each frame has been normalized to the same level as the frame we wish to sky - subtract .",
    "this brings out the objects , for which object masks are then created .",
    "once this procedure has been completed for all frames , it is repeated with the following differences .",
    "all the objects as well as all bad pixels are ignored when creating the sky frame for each frame by averaging the five ( temporally ) nearest frames .",
    "each of the final sky - subtracted images are flat at the level of @xmath50 .",
    "the remaining background contains fluctuations on a variety of spatial scales , and necessitate the use of a local background for the extraction of the flux of each galaxy .",
    "the entire pipeline is processed using scripts written in the environment .",
    "the faint objects classification and analysis system (; tyson & jarvis 1979 ; tyson 1988 ) package is used for detecting objects and for performing the aperture and the isophotal photometry .",
    "an `` object '' in is defined as a set of contiguous pixels , each of which meets or exceeds a minimal signal to noise ratio specified by the user .",
    "each object detected has its position , shape , and integrated flux measured and stored .",
    "measures three types of fluxes : fixed - aperture , isophotal , and `` total '' isophotal .",
    "we have chosen to use a @xmath51  arcsec diameter fixed aperture for the entire number - magnitude relation analysis .",
    "the isophotal magnitude corresponds to the amount of light within the isophote that is traced by the user - specified minimum signal to noise ratio , and is the magnitude system we have used in measuring the colors of the galaxies , as described below .",
    "the `` total '' isophotal flux is the flux measured in an object whose isophotal area is increased by a factor of two ; it is not used in this analysis .",
    "the aperture correction is a constant offset in magnitudes that corrects for the missing flux of an object more extended than the limiting ( fixed ) aperture . for a given aperture size ,",
    "the aperture correction can depend on the intensity - profile an object follows , and the distance as well .",
    "redshift information for each galaxy would be required to use metric apertures for determining the number - magnitude relation , but this is not possible at the flux levels reported here .",
    "it is instructive to consider the systematic effects of using aperture magnitudes when metric magnitudes are not available .",
    "galaxy surface brightness profiles can be parameterized by @xmath52 ( gunn & oke 1975 ) . for field galaxies ,",
    "a reasonable value is @xmath53 ( mobasher et al . 1993 ; glazebrook et al .",
    "1995b ) . based on this relation ,",
    "the amount of light in a @xmath51  arcsec diameter aperture compared to a @xmath54  kpc ( @xmath55100  km  s@xmath29mpc@xmath29 ) diameter metric aperture as a function of redshift is shown in figure 5 . for the middle of our magnitude range ( @xmath56  mag ) ,",
    "the median redshift for nonevolving galaxies in a euclidean universe is @xmath57 . near that redshift ,",
    "figure 5 shows that there is an approximately constant systematic offset of @xmath58  mag .",
    "because the offset is constant within @xmath59  mag between redshifts of @xmath60 , using sufficiently large fixed - apertures for calculating magnitudes should not introduce any strong systematic trends in the galaxies calculated magnitudes compared to their true magnitudes .",
    "there are observational limitations in the data , especially near the detection limits .",
    "extensive monte - carlo simulations were carried out to characterize the data and to determine the best methhod of analysis and presentation .",
    "for the entire analysis , the package was used to create simulated data sets , which were then analyzed exactly as the real data were , using the programs .",
    "we experimented with various proportions of elliptical and spiral galaxies in the simulations .",
    "these galaxies were generated using the routines , assuming no internal extinction , and a redshift distribution that corresponded to the apparent magnitude distribution for each iteration of the simulation .",
    "the data were placed in a `` noise - only '' image , which simulated our real mosaic . to create the `` noise - only '' image , a set of frames",
    "was created , each one being equivalent to a typical nirc exposure from our set of observations , except with no objects in it .",
    "the noise - frames were then mosaiced exactly as the real data were , thus creating a mosaic equivalent to each field with no objects , with all the effective signal to noise characteristics of the real mosaics .",
    "for each half - magnitude bin over the entire range of magnitudes that we span , five galaxies of random integrated magnitudes within that magnitude bin were placed in random locations in the `` noise - only '' mosaic .",
    "this was then re - analyzed normally using the programs , and the number and properties of the recovered galaxies was recorded . for each half - magnitude bin , this procedure was repeated one hundred times .",
    "these simulations give us enough information about the behavior of our mosaics to establish both a reasonable aperture correction and the recovery efficiency at each magnitude bin for different proportions of galaxy types , and to calculate the corrected number - magnitude relation .",
    "the recovery efficiency vector contains the fraction of galaxies recovered as a function of the center of the magnitude bin .",
    "the simulations for different ratios of galaxy types give slightly different aperture offsets , all within @xmath61  mag of @xmath62  mag .",
    "the scatter about the offset does not depend strongly on the assumed ratios .",
    "the completeness matrix , described below , reflects exactly where all the simulated galaxies go . in the end , however , the differences in the number - counts bins and slope are not very sensitive to the final result",
    ". we did not experiment with the inclusion of very diffuse or low surface brightness galaxies . for each of our simulation sets ,",
    "we reach a @xmath63% recovery rate of the simulated galaxies at @xmath64  mag with any @xmath65 .",
    "the insert in figure 7 plots the fraction of galaxies recovered as a function of the center of the magnitude bin for each of the galaxy type proportions and offsets that we calculated in the simulations .",
    "the final corrections that were applied to the data assume a @xmath66 ratio of ellipticals and spirals .",
    "figure 6 shows the output of this simulation .",
    "based on this output , we shall use a constant aperture correction of @xmath62  mag .",
    "the `` completeness matrix , '' @xmath67 , contains all the information about each set of simulations , and can help estimate the `` bin jumping '' that will happen when a galaxy s magnitude is not recovered within the magnitude range that it started out with . if we denote the observed number - magnitude vector as @xmath68 and the true number - magnitude vector as @xmath69 , then @xmath70 by inverting the completeness matrix , it is possible to recover the true number - magnitude vector @xmath71 this approach is used routinely in studies of globular cluster luminosity functions ( e.g. drukier et al .",
    "1993 ; and drukier et al .",
    "the completeness matrix for field i is given in table 4 .",
    "once the aperture offsets and the completeness corrections have been applied , the data are binned by whole - magnitude intervals .",
    "the galaxy counts are presented in table 5 , and plotted in figure 7 .",
    "the error bars are @xmath72 uncertainties based on the poisson statistics ( gehrels 1986 ) of the raw counts . for comparison ,",
    "we have plotted the results from several other deep @xmath0-band surveys , the deepest of which is by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which reaches about @xmath73  mag deeper than our data .",
    "for the range @xmath74 , the djorgovski et al .",
    "numbers are below our results , which seem to be more consistent with the other observations",
    ". this may be due to physical variations in the counts between fields , or at least in part to systematic differences introduced in the data analysis or the corrections .",
    "the uncertainties in our photometric zeropoints are all smaller than approximately a @xmath75  mag , which is far too small a shift to account for the variations that are seen .    over the interval @xmath76 , the logarithmic slope of our completeness - corrected galaxy counts is @xmath77 , consistent with the other deep @xmath0-band surveys .",
    "because of the large uncertainty in the @xmath78  mag bin , we can not confidently confirm that the counts continue to rise . as a guide to the interpretation of the counts",
    ", we have plotted models from yoshii & peterson ( 1995 ) in figure 7 .",
    "`` model 1 '' uses @xmath79 = ( 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.5 ) , and `` model 2 '' has ( 0.2,0.0,0.6 ) .",
    "the open models ( `` model 2 '' ) make a more reasonable fit to the count data alone than the @xmath80 models .",
    "no steadfast conclusions should be drawn from this comparison between data and models since any particular model should simultaneously explain the counts in all bandpasses , and the redshift distributions of all the faint galaxies .",
    "the @xmath0-band keck fields were chosen because of the extant extremely deep optical data of p96 ) . we combine the optical and near infrared photometry of these extremely faint galaxies to make color - magnitude and color - color diagrams , and compare the data with galactic evolution models , which will be discussed in the next section .    to obtain the objects colors , we combine the @xmath1 , @xmath2 with the @xmath0 mosaic ( which has been multiplied by the square root of its exposure map ; see section 2.1 ) by normalizing all three to have the same rms sky - noise value and then summing them .",
    "we call this combined @xmath11 image the `` @xmath81 '' image .",
    "is used to detect objects and to generate isophotes , as described in section 3.1 .",
    "the catalog and isophote boundaries thus created were then applied to each of the @xmath82 and @xmath0-band images individually . by this method the object - detection and the isophote determination is based on the combined image and the isophotes are not biased towards any one band .",
    "the object catalogs for both fields are listed in tables 2 and 3 . because aperture corrections are not well - defined for isophotal magnitudes , _ no _ corrections are applied to these data as they are plotted in the color - magnitude and color - color diagrams in figure 8 and 9 .",
    "similar diagrams using aperture magnitudes are reasonably comparable . in the color - color diagram , the sizes of the points scale with @xmath0-band magnitude as shown in the legend .",
    "the diagonal line in figure 8 is the @xmath83 flux limit of the @xmath2-band data ( @xmath84  mag ) .",
    "although there remain significant uncertainties in galaxy evolutionary codes ( charlot , worthey , & bressan 1996 ) , they are very powerful for developing a broad understanding of the nature of galaxies for which there is relatively limited photometric or spectroscopic information . with at least three bandpasses it is possible to compare models more directly with the data because the zeropoint normalization due to an assumed galaxy mass cancels out .",
    "especially with the near infrared data , we can directly probe the underlying old population of stars in each galaxy .",
    "thus , most of the emphasis in the following section is on the optical@xmath10near infrared color - color diagram ( figure 9 ) .",
    "the apparent magnitudes for the models expressed in the color - magnitude diagram ( figure 8) are normalized to a total mass for each galaxy of @xmath85 .",
    "we work primarily with a grid of bruzual - charlot ( 1993 , 1995 ) models spanning a large range of star formation rate ( sfr ) timescales viewed at redshifts in the range @xmath86 .",
    "all models are for solar metallicity , following a scalo imf .",
    "the star formation timescales used are @xmath87  gyr .",
    "one constant - rate star - formation model was also included , at @xmath88  m@xmath89  yr@xmath29 .",
    "no reddening has been included in the models , but the reddening vector for @xmath90 ( based on savage & mathis 1979 ) is shown in the color - color diagram ( figure 9 )",
    ". a realistic inclusion of reddening to this problem would involve a more complicated analysis than simply applying the effect of a simple dustscreen between the galaxy and the observer .",
    "the assumed cosmology is @xmath91  km  s@xmath29  mpc@xmath29 and @xmath92 .",
    "these grids of models have been examined two different ways .",
    "first , an explicit assumption is made for the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "the models overplotted in figure 9 assume a uniform epoch of star formation at @xmath93 . assuming a greater formation redshift ( e.g. @xmath94 ) does not change the results significantly , especially considering the photometric uncertainties in the data ( typical uncertainties in the colors are shown at the lower - right corner of figure 9 ) .",
    "using a lower @xmath95 does not change the models significantly .",
    "only four of the seven evolving models are plotted in figures 8 and 9 .",
    "the heavy - solid line traces a non - evolving elliptical galaxy as a function of redshift , i.e. pure k - correction ; the light - solid line is for an exponentially declining sfr with timescale @xmath59  gyr ; the short - dashed line is for an exponentially declining sfr with timescale @xmath96  gyr ; and the long - dash line is for a constant sfr , equal to @xmath88  m@xmath89yr@xmath29 .    the second approach to model building decouples the age constraint from the viewing redshift , so that galaxies are allowed to have formed at any time , with the only restriction being a requirement that a galaxy s age be less than the age of the universe at that epoch .",
    "reddening will generally move the model points toward the upper right in color - color space ( shown in figure 9 ) , while decreasing the model metallicity will primarily move the color - color point downward because of increased temperatures on the giant branch and changes in the main sequence lifetime .",
    "combinations of all three of these influences can populate much of the color - color space , but many of the combinations make little physical sense . while most galaxies have optical@xmath10near infrared colors that are consistent with any one of a large number of model parameter combinations , there are some extremely faint galaxies upon whose nature one may productively speculate .",
    "most of the galaxies have colors that are consistent with a population drawn from a variety of redshifts and galaxy types , as is evident from figures 8 and 9 .",
    "this is true even with the models plotted which assume a single formation redshift , @xmath97 , and in the context of the grids of models the range of possibilities is even greater .",
    "however , many of the brighter galaxies in this sample ( @xmath12 ) are red in both @xmath98 and @xmath99 ( figure 9 ) ; the most straightforward interpretation is that they are early - type galaxies at @xmath15 , though it is also possible for these galaxies to be either very old , or extremely reddened early- _ or _ late - type galaxies at redshifts of only a few tenths .",
    "either multi - band photometry or , preferably , spectroscopy is needed to distinguish between the possibilities .",
    "identifying the nature of some of these very red galaxies may have significant implications for setting an independent constraint on the age of the universe if they are old galaxies at moderately high redshifts .",
    "recently , spectroscopy of very red , faint galaxies ( e.g. 53w091 , @xmath100  mag , @xmath101  mag ; see dunlop et al . 1996 and spinrad et al .",
    "1996 ) is revealing examples of very old early - type galaxies at @xmath102 .    at @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath103 there are @xmath17 galaxies that are distinct from the galaxies described above . for convenience , we shall refer to them as the ` red outlier ' galaxies in the following discussion .",
    "similar outlier objects have turned up in all deep optical / near infrared surveys ( e.g. in the surveys by cowie et al .",
    "1994 , 1995 ; glazebrook et al . 1995 ; and originally by elston et al .",
    "1988 and elston et al .",
    "the galaxies in our fields are not quite as red as the apparently - rare objects detected by hu & ridgeway ( 1994 ) , which have @xmath104 , but parts of the discussion that follows may be applicable to those galaxies as well .",
    "the colors of the red outliers do not have an obvious correspondence with either the pure k - correction track , or any of the passive evolution tracks of figure 9 , which assume a single formation redshift @xmath97 .",
    "songaila et al .",
    "( 1994 ) argue that galaxies from their survey with colors similar to the red outliers are consistent with evolving populations for galaxies in the range @xmath105 .",
    "this is clearly not the case for elliptical galaxies that formed at @xmath97 , which would have considerably redder optical colors . in an effort to explain these red outliers",
    ", we explore several second - burst ellipticals models , the grid of bc95 models discussed in section 4.2 , and a qualitative scenario involving dust .",
    "based on the surface density and apparent @xmath0-band magnitudes of the red outliers , we discuss the relative merits of each scenario , and where possible , make predictions that will be possible to test in the near future .",
    "the surface density of the red outliers is substantial . within the @xmath3 square arcminutes",
    "we have surveyed , we detect @xmath17 such galaxies . if these galaxies are distributed to a distance of @xmath106 ,",
    "then their space density is of order @xmath107 mpc@xmath108 , which is only a factor ten smaller than that of @xmath109 galaxies locally . for an einstein - de sitter cosmology , these galaxies ,",
    "if placed at @xmath110 , would have an absolute magnitude @xmath111 , which is @xmath3 magnitudes below @xmath109 ( mobasher et al .",
    "thus the red outliers could be fairly common , not overly - luminous galaxies .",
    "the simplest extension of the single-@xmath112 models involves superimposing a judiciously timed second burst of star formation on a passively - evolving elliptical galaxy .",
    "we experimented with such second - burst elliptical galaxy models ( charlot 1995a , 1995b ) by adding bursts of star formation at various redshifts and for various mass fractions . if only small mass fractions are involved in the burst , then it is possible to drive the @xmath113 colors dramatically blueward while maintaining similar @xmath114 colors .",
    "the best combination has early - type galaxies undergoing bursts involving @xmath115 of their mass at @xmath116 .",
    "such objects come close to the colors of the red outliers , if the galaxies are viewed at redshifts no less than about 2.5 .",
    "this would imply that the red outliers , which make up less than @xmath117 of the galaxies at @xmath118  mag , all experienced a burst of star formation at the same time , and are being viewed specifically when they have their bluest optical ( rest - ultraviolet ) colors .",
    "it is conceivable that such a universal event could have occurred during an epoch of merging , but it would be odd that we do not see the resulting galaxies at lower redshifts .    by considering the grids of models described earlier ,",
    "the constraint on the particular age of a galaxy at each redshift is lifted . at redshifts lower than @xmath119 ,",
    "it is not possible to produce the colors of the red outliers , except perhaps with a combination of very low metallicity and a substantial amount of reddening .",
    "finally , we consider a qualitative scenario , where the red outliers are normal galaxies with dusty , old populations within their galactic nuclei . as a simple , but hardly unique demonstration , suppose that the outliers are in the range @xmath120 and are composed of a mixture of an old partly extincted population formed at @xmath121 , superposed with a young population of equal ( unextincted ) flux in the received @xmath1-band . from figure 9 , we can infer that the old population , if unextincted , would have observed colors , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , while the young population would have colors @xmath124 , @xmath125 . if the old population has one magnitude of extinction in the @xmath0-band , assuming that the optical depth varies as @xmath126 , we would expect a composite galaxy with color , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , which is consistent with the observed colors of the outliers .",
    "one can not simply argue for large dust absorption without being concerned about the contribution to the abundance of ir ultraluminous sources ( graham et al .",
    "1996 ; soifer et al .",
    "1994 ) , or to the diffuse 100@xmath129 background ( e.g. puget et al . 1996 ) , but the model above leads to less than 50% of the flux being reprocessed into the far ir .",
    "it is very likely that extinction is important in high redshift galaxies , especially in view of recent claims of the detection of a 100@xmath129 cosmological background radiation ( puget et al 1996 ) .",
    "ground - based searches for the predicted bright phase associated with elliptical formation have been singularly unsuccessful ( e.g. thompson et al .",
    "1995 ; thompson & djorgovski 1995 ; pahre & djorgovski 1995 ) , implying that ellipticals ( and spheroids ) formed at high redshift , were dust - enshrouded , or both .",
    "theoretical arguments which appeal to the analogy between starbursts and the formation of spheroids suggest that the ultraluminous phase of spheroid formation may be visible only at far infrared wavelengths ( silk & wyse 1996 ; zepf & silk 1996 ) .",
    "spheroid formation is believed to be triggered by mergers , which generate a central ( within 1  kpc ) agglomeration of gas and induce a central starburst .",
    "strong winds , whose presence is indirectly inferred from requirements of early enrichment of intracluster gas , clear away much of the dust , leaving a reddened nucleus . disks form by subsequent infall of gas , and chemical evolution models strongly favor an inside - out formation sequence disk of star formation ( wang & silk 1994 ; prantzos & aubert 1995 ) .",
    "this leads us to the natural expectation that the early evolution of a spheroid - dominated galaxy ( s0 , sa , sb ) should reveal a dusty , evolved nucleus , surrounded by a young , vigorously star - forming , relatively low metallicity and so dust - free , disk .",
    "only the @xmath0-band flux can penetrate the dusty central region ; with hst quality imaging in the near - ir , one would expect in this picture for the @xmath0 flux to be more centrally concentrated than the @xmath1 or @xmath2 flux for the outliers . these observations will become feasible with the nicmos array on the hst .    clearly , redshifts would remove much of the ambiguity in this puzzle .",
    "that is a fairly difficult task , particularly if the red oultiers are absorption - line galaxies .",
    "all of the outliers in this survey are fainter than @xmath130  mag . at the moment",
    "only the keck telesope might be able to obtain spectra for such faint galaxies , and even with the keck , spectroscopy for objects this faint will probably have to wait for adaptive optics to allow very narrow slits to reduce the foreground sky emission .",
    "finally , do brown dwarfs fit anywhere in the picture ?",
    "recently , improved atmospheric models for brown dwarfs have emerged ( burrows 1994 ) , as well as actual detections of brown dwarfs ( basri et al .",
    "1995a ; nakajima et al .",
    "models from burrows ( 1994 ) , and the actual datapoint for basri et al.s ( 1995a ) detected brown dwarf , ppl-15 in the pleiades ( @xmath0 photometry from basri et al .",
    "1995b ; @xmath1 and @xmath2 photometry from stauffer et al . 1994 ) , are plotted in the color - color diagram ( figure 9 ) .",
    "there are several objects we detect that are in the vicinity of the locus of points implied by ppl-15 and the burrows models .",
    "we survey less than two square arcminutes of `` blank '' sky at rather high galactic latitudes , so the a priori chances of intercepting _ any _ star in our lines of sight are exceedingly slim .",
    "our number - magnitude results show that the counts continue to increase above @xmath4  mag , reaching surface densities of few  @xmath5  degree@xmath6 . fitting the ( corrected ) number - magnitude data over the range @xmath8  mag",
    "we derive a slope of d  log  n  /  d  mag  @xmath77 .",
    "the optical@xmath10near - infrared colors of the extremely faint galaxies show that the majority of objects are consistent with spirals and irregulars at redshifts around few tenths or greater .",
    "a few objects have colors consistent with elliptical galaxies at @xmath131 .",
    "there is a rather large density of faint ( @xmath118 ) `` red outlier '' galaxies , with blue optical colors @xmath19 and red near - infrared colors @xmath18 . by exploring a broad range of bruzual - charlot isochrone synthesis evolutionary models and by a qualitative scenario that involves dust ,",
    "several possibilities are identified .",
    "redshifts , @xmath61  arcsec quality imaging in the near - infrared , or both will be required to determine their nature conclusively .",
    "we would like to thank stephane charlot for his assistance with the bc93 and the bc95 models , w. harrison and b. schaeffer for assistance with the w. m. keck observations , and s. dodorico , m. tarenghi , and e. j. wampler for allowing us to use the ntt observations in advance of publication .",
    "lam would particularly like to thank steve zepf for many useful and stimulating conversations , and mark dickinson for frequent de - mystifying and enlightening advice .",
    "the referee harry ferguson provided invaluable feedback on this work .",
