    "we have observed the local galaxy andromeda ( m31 ) , the nearest spiral galaxy in the local group , with _",
    "herschel_. simultaneous observations were conducted in five bands from 100 to 500 @xmath2 m , of a @xmath3 degree area @xcite .",
    "we study , for the first time at these wavebands , the characteristics of the extended dust emission , focusing on larger scales than ever done before for m31 .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the spatial resolution that the instruments onboard _ herschel _ can reach , we are able to study the geometrical distribution and the properties of dust on a sub - kpc scale .    here , we summarize the results from a series of papers whose goal is the study of the morphology of the interstellar medium in andromeda , with a particular focus on the physical properties of dust as a function of position and galactocentric distance .",
    "in the left  hand panel of fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] , we show a view of m31 at 250 @xmath2 m .",
    "this wavelength gives the best compromise between sensitivity and spatial resolution .",
    "we have tried to identify structures belonging to m31 out to the largest distances , but this task turned out to be quite challenging due to the presence of a substantial amount of galactic dust sitting on the line of sight between us and andromeda .",
    "we have used the 21 cm hydrogen maps from @xcite and @xcite to disentangle the dust emission coming from m31 from that of the galactic cirrus .",
    "we exploit the physical link between gas and dust , and the fact that hi observations carry also the information on the gas velocity : this is used to tell which gas ( and hence dust ) component belongs to m31 and which one to the milky way . in this way",
    ", we manage to remove the galactic cirrus emission from our data even though the north - east portion of our maps still remains quite confused , retaining some contamination .",
    "this only marginally affects the outskirts of m31 , at _ herschel _ wavebands .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     we first looked for the presence of dust at large distances from m31 at the high - velocity clouds location @xcite .",
    "a quick check of the most massive one , davis cloud , was enough to make us realize that our _ herschel _ data are not sensitive enough for the detection of a possible dust component here .",
    "hence , we concentrated our search in the disk outskirts , specifically in the south ",
    "west region : the fact that there is no cirrus contamination makes the dust detection here quite clear , out to galactocentric distances of @xmath1 kpc .",
    "three ring - like structures are revealed , at distances of 21 ( e ) , 26 ( f ) and 31 ( g ) kpc , respectively , from the nucleus .",
    "even though quite faint , their detection is confirmed by the perfect coincidence with similar features observed in the 0-moment 21 cm map from @xcite .",
    "we have tried to check whether these features have a counterpart , at similar distances , on the opposite side of the galaxy . due to the high degree of confusion of the north ",
    "east region , we are not able to tell whether this is the case or not , with the only exception of structure `` e '' , the closest one , even though impossible to follow along all the disk of the galaxy .",
    "these newly discovered structures add to the already well  known morphological features of m31 , such as the 10 kpc star forming ring and the 15 kpc ring ( already known for a while ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the more recently discovered 1.5 kpc , inner ring @xcite .",
    "overall , we find evidence of a recurrent pattern in the morphological features of the dust in m31 : rings , or more in general , arc - like structures are found at distances of 5 kpc each .",
    "if we also take into account a structure defined by @xcite as an arm - crossing region , located at @xmath4 kpc from the center , we note that m31 has structures at radii of 5 , 10 , 15 , 21 , 26 and 31 kpc .",
    "while the presence of these structures was never investigated before , the appearance of multiple rings in a galaxy was argued to be compatible with dissipative cloud collisions and weak bar perturbation , which would give rise to resonances , due to gravitational torques @xcite .",
    "we adopted a different , more systematic approach to the study of the ism morphology in @xcite , where we de - projected our _ herschel _ images and applied csar @xcite , a source extraction algorithm suited for taking into account the hierarchical tree which builds up the arms and disks structure of the ism in m31 .",
    "this yields a catalog of point sources which correspond to giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) . following a similar approach as in @xcite",
    ", we fit 2 rings to the positions of the molecular clouds , ending up with a best fit radius of @xmath5 and @xmath6 kpc , respectively , reproducing the 10 and 15 kpc rings ( see sect .  2 ) .",
    "we then fit 2 logarithmic spiral arms to the remaining points , letting the pitch angle as a free parameters .",
    "such spiral arms are indeed suited to reproduce the gmcs dislocation , and they turn to have an angle of @xmath7 .    consistently with the findings by @xcite , the best fit models for these two rings are displaced with respect to the optical centre of m31 .",
    "it was argued that this displacement might be the result of a head  on collision with andromeda s compact satellite m32 , as dynamical simulations from the latter work tend indeed to confirm .",
    "in @xcite we took advantage of _ herschel _ high resolution data , and used pacs and spire images to build the fir spatially - resolved sed of andromeda .",
    "we fit a modified black ",
    "body function to the sed of each of the pixels , limiting ourselves to those having a flux above @xmath8 in all bands . despite this quite severe requirement ,",
    "we are left with @xmath9 pixels .",
    "our fitting procedure considers 3 free parameters : the dust emissivity index @xmath10 , the dust mass and its temperature ( t@xmath11 ) . like this",
    ", we assume that dust emits at one single temperature , while it is more likely that a range of temperatures , in the same position , would be a more realistic description . in spite of this simplification ,",
    "we find a @xmath12 value less than 2.73 for more than 90% of the pixels , showing that our model is an adequate description of the dust sed at a pixel scale .",
    "the result of the fits are then be used to trace the properties of dust on a physical scale of about 140 pc , as a function of the location .",
    "interestingly , we find the highest values of t@xmath11 ( @xmath13 k ) inside the bulge , which is dominated by old stars , while in the 10 kpc ring , where star formation is currently occurring , the temperature is constant , about 17 k only . furthermore ,",
    "if the radial profile is considered , we notice that the temperature monotonically decreases from the center out to @xmath14 kpc , and then it assumes a slightly positive slope .",
    "this trend is mirrored by that of the emissivity index @xmath10 which increases out to the same distance , and then it decrease again towards the outskirts of the galaxy . as there is a",
    "well known degeneracy between dust temperature and the @xmath10 parameter , we used montecarlo simulations to check whether these trends are spurious effect caused by this , and found that this is not the case .",
    "the fact that the dust temperature is much higher in the bulge region , which is dominated by old stellar stars and where star formation activity is minimal if not absent at all , while it is significantly lower in the star  forming ring , rises a question about the dust heating sources and mechanism .",
    "it had already been argued that dust in some nearby galaxies and in m31 itself , might be significantly heated by a old stellar population .",
    "we investigated this , and we found a linear dependency of t@xmath11 on the 3.6 @xmath2 m emission in the inner 3.1 kpc region ( fig.[fig : fig1 ] , right panel ) . as this band traces very well the presence of old stars , this correlation suggests that indeed the old bulge population is the one which is responsible for the dust heating in the central region .",
    "we argue that different values of @xmath10 could maybe be due to differences in the composition of the dust , or substantial changes in the radiation field leading to changes in the grain size ( from sputtering ) or mantle loss .",
    "we have used _ herschel _ pacs and spire observations to probe the dust properties and morphology in the nearby galaxy m31 .",
    "we performed analysis both on a global and on a spatially resolved scale .",
    "we can summarize our results as follows :    1 .",
    "m31 s ir morphology is dominated by 2 rings and 2 spiral arms ; 2 .",
    "there is a recurrent radial pattern in the presence of structures : arc - like features are detected at intervals of @xmath4 kpc , out to a galactocentric distance of @xmath1 kpc ; 3 .",
    "a variable emissivity index @xmath10 is required to fit the spatially resolved ir sed ; 4 .",
    "there is a transition region at a distance of @xmath15 kpc , marking different dust properties , or witnessing a change in the radiation field ; 5 .",
    "t@xmath11 is the highest in the bulge ( 30 k ) , only reaching 17 k in the starforming ring ; 6 .",
    "the strong correlation between the 3.6 @xmath2 m flux and t@xmath11 in the inner regions strongly suggest that old stars in the bulge are the responsible for these `` high '' temperatures .",
