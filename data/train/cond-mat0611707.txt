    "the critical behavior appears approximately independent of the impurity concentration , but definitely different from the one of the pure system .",
    "these results support the existence of a random ising universality class which differs from the one of pure ising systems .. in the absence of dilution , for small @xmath13 the transition is in the ising universality class : the magnetic field does not change the critical behavior . in the presence of dilution instead , @xmath13 is relevant and the critical behavior for @xmath14 belongs to the random - field ising universality class  @xcite .",

    "another related lattice model is the randomly bond - diluted ising model ( rbim ) with hamiltonian @xmath20 where the bond variables @xmath21 are uncorrelated quenched random variables , which are equal to one with probability @xmath19 and zero with probability @xmath11 .",
    "note that the rsim can be seen as a rbim with bond variables @xmath22 .",
    "but in this case the bond variables are correlated .",
    "for example , the connected average of the bond variables along a plaquette does not vanish as in the case of uncorrelated bond variables : indeed ( note that @xmath23 ) @xmath24 above the percolation threshold of the spins , these models undergo a phase transition between a disordered and a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "its nature has been the object of many theoretical studies , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "a natural scenario is that the critical behavior of the rsim and the rbim , at any value of @xmath19 above the spin percolation threshold , belongs to the same universality class , which we will call randomly dilute ising ( rdis ) universality class .",

    "the standard ising fp at @xmath36 is unstable , with a crossover exponent @xcite @xmath37 , where @xcite @xmath38 is the specific - heat exponent of the ising universality class .",
    "the stable rdis fp determines the critical behavior at the phase transition between the disordered and the ferromagnetic phase that occurs in rdis systems .",
    "therefore , it is expected to determine the critical behavior of the rsim and of the rbim above the spin percolation threshold .",
    "the critical exponents at the rdis fp have been computed perturbatively to six loops in the three - dimensional massive zero - momentum scheme @xcite . even though the perturbative series are not borel summable @xcite , appropriate resummations provide quite accurate results @xcite : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 . moreover ,",

    "@xcite .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the rsim and the rbim have long been inconclusive in settling the question of the critical behavior of these models . while the measured critical exponents were definitely different from the ising ones , results apparently depended on the spin concentration , in disagreement with rg theory .",
    "the question was clarified in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the apparent violations of universality were explained by the presence of large concentration - dependent scaling corrections , which decay very slowly because of the small value of the exponent @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",

    "on the other hand , results for the rbim have been less satisfactory .",
    "recent works , based on fss analyses  @xcite of mc data up to @xmath58 and high - temperature expansions  @xcite , have apparently found asymptotic power - law behaviors that are quite dependent on the spin concentration .",
    "such results may again be explained by the presence of sizeable and spin - concentration dependent scaling corrections .",
    "the rsim and the rbim , and in general systems which are supposed to belong to the rdis universality class , are examples of models in which the presence of slowly - decaying scaling corrections makes the determination of the asymptotic critical behavior quite difficult . in these cases ,",
    "the universal critical behavior can be reliably determined only if scaling corrections are kept under control in the numerical analyses .",
    "for example , the wegner expansion of the magnetic susceptibility @xmath59 is generally given by  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the reduced temperature .",
    "we have neglected additional terms due to other irrelevant operators and terms due to the analytic background present in the free energy @xcite . in the case of the three - dimensional rdis universality class",
    "we have @xcite @xmath62 , which is very small , and @xcite @xmath63 .",
    "analogously , the finite - size scaling ( fss ) behavior at criticality is given by @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 for the rdis universality class .",
    "the main purposes of this paper are the following :    * we wish to improve the numerical estimates of the critical exponents associated with the asymptotic behavior and with the leading scaling corrections . *",
    "we wish to provide robust evidence that the critical behaviors of the rsim and of the rbim belong to the same rdis universality class , independently of the impurity concentration .    for these purposes , we perform a high - statistics mc simulation of the rsim for @xmath54 and @xmath67 , and of the rbim for @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for lattice sizes up to @xmath70 .",
    "the critical behavior is obtained by a careful fss analysis , in which a rg invariant quantity ( we shall use @xmath71 ) is kept fixed .",
    "this method has significant advantages @xcite with respect to more standard approaches , and , in particular , it does not require a precise estimate of @xmath72 .",

    "if we further assume @xmath479 , we find that the bias is of order @xmath480 .",

    "therefore , it is no longer possible to take @xmath251 at will . to avoid the bias ,",
    "@xmath251 should be significantly larger than the autocorrelation time .",

    "[ fignm ] we compare , for a specific run of the rsim at @xmath54 , the value of the derivatives @xmath490 , @xmath340 , with and without bias correction , as a function of @xmath251 ; data obtained for @xmath491 are reweighted to have @xmath301 [ this corresponds to @xmath492 .",
