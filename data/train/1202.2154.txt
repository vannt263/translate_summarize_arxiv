    "let now address point ( i ) .",
    "we consider the classical hamiltonian mentioned above , with ( attractive ) potential @xmath17 which diverges for any dimensionless distance @xmath18 , and precisely equals @xmath19 for @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "as mentioned , we verify that the potential energy per particle @xmath23 diverges for @xmath8 ( long - range interactions ) , and converges for @xmath24 ( short - range interactions ) .",
    "we also verify straightforwardly that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "this expression implies that @xmath27 is extensive ( i.e. , @xmath28 ) for @xmath24 , and nonextensive otherwise .",
    "more precisely , @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and proportional to @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "let us now focus on a generic thermodynamical potential @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the temperature , pressure , chemical potential , and @xmath35 are the internal energy , entropy , volume , number of particles . for a classical model in the above short / long range class , the thermodynamic limit corresponds to taking @xmath36 in the following expression : @xmath37 hence @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the correctness of these ( conjectural ) scalings has been profusely verified in the literature ( in ferrofluid @xcite , fluid @xcite , magnetic @xcite , diffusive @xcite , percolation @xcite systems , among others ; see @xcite for an overview ) . in all these cases",
    ", it has been verified that _",
    "finite _ equations of states are obtained , for both short- and long - range interactions , in the @xmath36 limit when using these rescaled thermodynamic variables , whereas the use of the standard ( i.e. , non rescaled , or equivalently , rescaled with @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) variables works ( naturally ) correctly for short - range interactions , but fails for long - range ones .",
    "what eq .",
    "( [ tilde ] ) implies is that @xmath42 play totally analogous thermodynamical roles , in particular that they are _ extensive in all cases _ ( which , for @xmath15 , is verified by mere construction ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and all thermodynamic potentials are extensive for short - range interactions , but are superextensive for long - range interactions .",
    "analogously , @xmath45 are intensive for short - range interactions , but scale with @xmath40 for long - range interactions .",
    "we see therefore that the traditional thermodynamical variables which are extensive for short - range interactions split into two classes for long - range ones .",
    "the first class corresponds to energies ( which become super - extensive in the long - range case ) .",
    "the second class corresponds to those variables which appear , within the usual legendre transformations , in thermodynamically conjugated pairs .",
    "this class remains extensive even in the long - range case .",
    "the entropy belongs to this class .",
    "a second argument pointing towards the correctness of using nonadditive entropic forms in order to re - establish the entropic extensivity of the system can be found in the mutually consistent results achieved by hanel and thurner @xcite by focusing on the khinchine axioms and on complex systems with surface - dominant statistics . as a third indication we can refer to the analogy with the time @xmath46 dependence of the entropy of simple nonlinear dynamical systems , e.g. , the logistic map . indeed , for the parameter values for which the system has positive lyapunov exponent ( i.e. , strong chaos and ergodicity )",
    ", we verify @xmath47 ( under appropriate mathematical limits ) , but for parameter values where the lyapunov exponent vanishes ( i.e. , weak chaos and breakdown of ergodicity ) , it is a nonadditive entropy ( @xmath48 , discussed below ) the one which grows linearly with @xmath46 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if we take into account that , in many such dynamical systems , @xmath46 plays a role analogous to @xmath15 in thermodynamical systems , we have here one more indication which aligns with the extensivity of the entropy for complex systems .",
    "let us now turn onto the above mentioned point ( ii ) , namely the fact that entropies generalizing that of bg become necessary in order to recover thermodynamic extensivity for nonstandard systems .    as a possibility for addressing complexities such as those illustrated above it was proposed in 1988  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) a generalization of the bg theory , currently referred to as nonextensive statistical mechanics .",
    "it is based on the nonadditive entropy @xmath49 with @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "@xmath48 recovers @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "if @xmath54 and @xmath55 are two probabilistically independent systems ( i.e. , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , definition ( [ qentropy ] ) implies @xmath58 in other words , according to the definition of entropic additivity in @xcite , @xmath48 is additive if @xmath59 , and nonadditive otherwise .",
    "if probabilities are all equal , we straightforwardly obtain @xmath60 if we extremize ( [ qentropy ] ) with a ( finite ) constraint on the width of the probability distribution @xmath61 ( in addition to its normalization ) , we obtain @xmath62 @xmath63 being the inverse of the @xmath64-logarithmic function , i.e. , @xmath65^{1/(1-q)}$ ] ( @xmath66 ) ; @xmath67 are the energy levels ; @xmath68 is an effective inverse temperature .",
    "complexity frequently emerges in natural , artificial and social systems .",
    "it may be caused by various geometrical - dynamical ingredients , which include non - ergodicity , long - term memory , multifractality , and other spatial - temporal long - range correlations between the elements of the system . during the last two decades ,",
    "many such phenomena have been successfully approached in the frame of nonextensive statistical mechanics .",
    "predictions , verifications and various applications have been performed in high - energy physics @xcite , spin - glasses @xcite , cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , anomalous diffusion @xcite , dusty plasmas @xcite , solar physics @xcite , relativistic and nonrelativistic nonlinear quantum mechanics @xcite , among many others .",
    "if the @xmath15 elements of the physical system are independent ( or quasi - independent in some sense ) , we have that @xmath69 therefore , by illustrating the present point for the particular case of equal probabilities , we immediately verify that @xmath70 hence thermodynamical extensivity is satisfied .",
    "this reconfirms that , for such systems , the thermodynamically admissible entropy is precisely given by the additive one , @xmath71 , as well known .",
    "if , however , strong correlations are present ( of the type assumed in the @xmath64-generalization of the central limit and lvy - gnedenko theorems @xcite ) , we can have @xmath72 in this case , we straightforwardly verify that , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 which satisfies thermodynamical extensivity , in contrast with @xmath75 , which violates it .",
    "probabilistic and physical models which belong to this class are respectively available in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , for @xmath76 , expression ( [ b ] ) becomes increasingly smaller than ( [ a ] ) .",
    "a similar situation occurs for @xmath77 which also becomes increasingly smaller that ( [ a ] ) ( though larger than ( [ b ] ) ) .",
    "the entropy associated with @xmath78 is of course @xmath71 .",
    "what about @xmath79 ?",
    "the answer is in fact already available in the literature ( footnote of page 69 in @xcite ) , namely , @xmath80 the case @xmath81 recovers @xmath71 .",
    "this entropy is , like @xmath48 for @xmath82 , concave for @xmath83 ) . and , also like @xmath48 for @xmath84 , it is nonadditive for @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , for probabilistically independent systems @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( hence @xmath86 ) , we verify @xmath87 .",
    "for equal probabilities we have @xmath88 hence , for @xmath89 , @xmath90^{1/\\delta } +      \\left [   \\frac{s_\\delta(b)}{k_b } \\right]^{1/\\delta }    \\right\\}^\\delta \\ , .",
    "\\label{deltaentropy2}\\ ] ] it is easily verified that , if @xmath91 satisfies ( [ c ] ) , @xmath92 is extensive for @xmath93 .",
    "this is in fact true even if @xmath94 @xmath95 being any function satisfying @xmath96 .",
    "let us now unify @xmath48 ( eq .",
    "( [ qentropy ] ) ) and @xmath97 ( eq .  ( [ deltaentropy ] ) ) as follows : @xmath98 @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively recover @xmath48 and @xmath97 ; @xmath101 recovers @xmath71 . obviously this entropy is nonadditive unless @xmath102 , and it is expansible , @xmath103 .",
    "it is concave for all @xmath82 and @xmath104 . in the limit @xmath105 ,",
    "this condition becomes @xmath106 , and any @xmath107 for @xmath108 ; see figs .",
    "[ figsdelta_3d ] and [ figqdelta ] . by the way , several two - parameter entropic functionals different from @xmath109 are in fact available in the literature ( see , for instance , @xcite , and also @xcite ) .",
    "in particular the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath109 in the thermodynamic limit coincide , for all values of @xmath110 , with those of the recently introduced hanel - thurner entropy @xmath111 @xcite for appropriate values of @xmath112 .     as a function of the index @xmath113 and the probability @xmath114 of a binary variable ( @xmath115 ) .",

    "we can address now the area law .",
    "it has been verified for those anomalous @xmath0-dimensional systems that essentially yield @xmath117 , which implies that @xmath91 is of the type indicated in ( [ stretched ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath118 for @xmath119 is extensive , thus satisfying thermodynamics .",
    "consistently , this new black - hole entropy is _ extensive for arbitrary distributions of probabilities _ , and , for equal probabilities , it can be connected with the well - known bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath120 through @xmath121 where @xmath122 @xmath123 being the event horizon area .",
    "it is important to stress that eq .   has _",
    "not _ been imposed in an _ ad hoc _ manner just to transform @xmath11 into @xmath124 : it has been derived from a new entropic functional , namely @xmath125 .",
    "this entropy @xmath125 has been defined under the assumption that the current black - hole result @xmath126 is correct . also , by using the fact that @xmath127 , we verify that @xmath128 increases monotonically with @xmath120 .",
    "this may be seen as a consistent test in what concerns the second principle of the thermodynamics , namely that whenever @xmath120 increases with time , @xmath128 does the same .    at the present state of knowledge",
    "we can not exclude the possibility of extensivity of @xmath109 for other special values of @xmath110 , particularly in the limit @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , assume for instance that we have @xmath130 in ( [ stretched ] ) , and take the limit @xmath131 , hence @xmath129 .",
    "the condition @xmath96 is satisfied for any @xmath132 , but it is violated for @xmath133 , which opens the door for @xmath48 , or some other nonadditive entropic functional , being the thermodynamically appropriate entropy .",
    "for example , for the @xmath134 gapless fermionic system in @xcite , we have analytically proved the extensivity of @xmath48 for a specific value of @xmath135 which depends on the central charge of the universality class that we are focusing on . for the @xmath136 gapless bosonic system in @xcite",
    ", we have numerically found that , once again , it is @xmath48 ( with a value of @xmath135 ) the entropy which is extensive and consequently satisfies thermodynamics .",
    "this kind of scenario might be present in many @xmath0-dimensional physical systems for which @xmath137 ( i.e. , @xmath138 for @xmath134 , and @xmath139 for @xmath2 ) .    summarizing , classical thermodynamics , and the thermostatistics of a wide class of systems whose elements are strongly correlated ( for instance , through long - range interactions , or through strong quantum entanglement , or both , such as black holes , quantum gravitational dense systems , and others )",
    "can be reconciled ( along lines similar to those illustrated in @xcite for simple cases ) .",
    "it is enough to use for these complex systems the nonadditive entropies such as @xmath140 , instead of the usual boltzmann - gibbs - von neumann one .",

    "@xmath141 we recover the bg entropy @xmath71 . at @xmath142 ( @xmath59 )",

    "the entropy @xmath97 is concave for @xmath145 . if we impose the extensivity of @xmath109 for the class of systems represented by eq .",

    "<S> this inconsistency disappears if we realize that the entropies of such nonstandard systems must _ not _ be associated with the additive expression @xmath5 but with appropriate nonadditive generalizations . </S>",
    "<S> here we introduce a generalized form of entropy which solves the puzzle for the black hole and the area law .    in his 1902 book _ elementary principles in statistical mechanics _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , gibbs emphatically points that systems involving long - range interactions are intractable within the boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) theory , due to the divergence of the partition function . as an illustration of his remark he refers specifically to the case of gravitation . </S>",

    "<S> the potential is not integrable , i.e. , the integral @xmath9 diverges . from the microscopic ( classical ) dynamical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , this is directly related to the fact that the entire lyapunov spectrum vanishes in the @xmath10 limit , which typically impeaches ergodicity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> this type of difficulty is also present , sometimes in an even more subtle manner , in various quantum systems ( the _ free _ hydrogen atom constitutes , among many others , an elementary such example ; indeed its bg partition function diverges due to the accumulation of electronic energy levels just below the ionization energy ) .    </S>",
    "<S> along closely related lines , since the pioneering works of bekenstein @xcite and hawking @xcite , it has become frequent in the literature the ( explicit or tacit ) acceptance that the black - hole entropy is anomalous in the sense that it violates thermodynamical extensivity . </S>",
    "<S> indeed we read all the time claims that the entropy of the black hole is proportional to the area of its boundary instead of being proportional to the black - hole volume @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally speaking we have the so called _ area law _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which states that the entropy of a class of quantum systems is proportional to @xmath11 instead of @xmath12 , i.e. , that it is proportional to @xmath13 , instead of being proportional to @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the number of elements of the system and @xmath3 is a characteristic length ( @xmath16 precisely corresponds to the black hole ) . </S>",
    "<S> strangely enough , gibbs s crucial remark and the dramatic theoretical features to which it is related are often overlooked in textbooks . </S>",

    "<S> the usual inclination is to consider that , for such complex systems , the entropy is not expected to satisfy thermodynamics . physically speaking , </S>",
    "<S> we consider such standpoint a quite bizarre one . </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present paper is to overcome this difficulty . </S>",
    "<S> we shall argue here along two inter - related lines : ( i ) the physically appropriate entropy of a given system should in all cases satisfy classical thermodynamics , and be therefore extensive ; ( ii ) the fact ( repeatedly illustrated in various manners for strongly entangled systems , black holes and , generically speaking , for systems satisfying the above mentioned area law ) that the boltzmann - gibbs - von neumann entropy is _ not _ proportional to @xmath15 precisely shows that , for such strongly correlated systems , _ the entropy is not the usual one but a substantially different one _ ; such an entropy is introduced here . </S>"
