    "it has been more than three decades since the first reports of star - to - star differences in light element abundances among members of galactic globular clusters @xcite . that these intra - cluster inhomogeneities are confined to c , n , o , and often na , al , and mg , suggests an origin involving element production via the cno - cycle and associated proton - addition reactions .",
    "two likely sites for this nucleosynthesis exist : one , within the presently evolving cluster stars during red giant branch ( rgb ) ascent , where conditions above the h - burning shell may allow material exposed to partial cn(o)-processing to be mixed to the stellar surface ( i.e. , a deep dredge - up mechanism ) .",
    "a second possible site lies in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of more massive cluster members ( now white dwarfs ) , whose ejecta were incorporated into the present stars .",
    "unfortunately , the signatures of both sources appear remarkably similar and observing the presence of cn(o)-cycle material in the photosphere of an evolved cluster rgb star is not a sufficient discriminant as to its origin . this has been made abundantly clear by the detection of o - na and mg - al anti - correlations among ngc 6752 main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) and subgiant branch ( sgb ) stars by .",
    "the two possibilities may however be disentangled by exploring a span in luminosity ( evolutionary state ) from the rgb tip to the main - sequence ( ms ) .",
    "abundance changes with position on the rgb signal the operation of internal processes , while composition patterns present among ms stars are in place before rgb ascent and the onset of deep mixing .    as telescope apertures and instrumentation have improved , such tests have become increasingly feasible and data now exist on abundance variations among low luminosity stars of a number of clusters . perhaps not so surprisingly , we find ourselves now facing a wealth of evidence that suggests not one origin or the other but rather both .",
    "the progressive depletions in [ c / fe ] with decreasing m@xmath1 seen among the stars of the more metal - poor clusters , the drop in li abundances at the luminosity function `` bump '' observed by in ngc 6752 , and the change in isotopic c abundances with luminosity in ngc 6528 and m4 found by @xcite provide dramatic evidence of a deep dredge - up mechanism . yet",
    "also , significant star - to - star differences in c and n have been found among the faintest stars of every cluster studied to the level of the sgb or below .",
    "most recently , @xcite documented substantial [ c / fe ] differences in a sample of m13 sgb stars which appeared to be subsequently modified during rgb ascent .",
    "thus it would seem that in order to fully quantify the effects of deep mixing one must know the compositions of the stars before they reach the rgb .",
    "the process(es ) which set the compositions of the cluster pre - rgb stars presumably operated early in the cluster histories .",
    "that large fractions of the members of every cluster studied to date show significant differences of at least c and n imply this was not the result of some unique condition among one or two clusters and it involved a non - trivial portion of each cluster s mass .",
    "as has been discussed by @xcite  the process appears not to be a simple accretion event .",
    "it is evident then that a complete understanding of the origin of abundance inhomogeneities in globular clusters must take account of the pattern of light element abundances among the main sequence stars in these objects . with this in mind , we present a c and n abundance analysis of ms stars in 47 tucanae , one of the most favorable globular clusters in the milky way for the study of main sequence abundances .",
    "we base our analysis on the data set obtained by @xcite , who detected significant cn and ch variations as faint as 2.5  mag below the msto of 47 tuc .",
    "the occurrence of cn variations among these low - mass stars favors accretion or primordial scenarios , since the capability of such stars to maintain interior cno - cycle burning is reduced by a factor of at least ten compared to the main - sequence turn - off ; thus such stars are not expected to be able to modify their surface c and n abundances .",
    "the sample selection , observations , and reduction of the 47 tuc ms and msto spectra used in this analysis are described in @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "115 program stars were selected from mpg / eso 2.2 m images of 47 tuc to span a range in luminosity from the msto to @xmath2 mag fainter .",
    "photometry of the stars was also extracted from these images .",
    "the spectra were obtained at the eso vlt using multi - slit masks with the focal reducer and low dispersion spectrograph 2 and cover from 3800 to 5500   at r = 815 .",
    "the locations of the stars on the 47 tuc color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) are shown in figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "membership was assessed in @xcite based on radial velocity ( unfortunately only @xmath3  km  s@xmath4  for 47 tuc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and position in the cmd ( within 0.025 mag of the cluster fiducial ) .",
    "as a further test of membership , we have measured an mgh sensitive index ( mgh , with a feature bandpass from 5160 to 5195  , and continuum bandpasses from 5130 to 5160 and 5195 to 5225  ) which is plotted in figure [ fig_2 ] ( see also table [ tbl-1 ] ) . of the stars in the sample , an additional 11 have mgh band strengths inconsistent with the other members of the cluster .",
    "we will presume these stars to also be non - members of 47 tuc and they will not be included further .",
    "indices sensitive to absorption by cn at 3883   and ch at 4300    were measured from these spectra and are presented in @xcite . however",
    ", here we use the i(ch ) index as defined in @xcite rather than ch(4300 ) to aid in comparison with the low luminosity stars of m71 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cn ( s(3839 ) ) and ch ( i(ch ) ) indices of the stars in the sample which are presumed members and further have measurable cn , ch indices are given in table [ tbl-1 ] and plotted in figure [ fig_3 ] , where the cn - bimodality and cn - ch anti - correlation noted by @xcite is quite evident .",
    "the error bars shown are at the one - sigma level as determined from poisson statistics in the index bandpasses .    as noted in @xcite single - sided indices such as s(3839 ) can suffer from zero - point offsets due to differences in slopes caused by flat fielding , instrumental response , etc .",
    "the observed spectra were therefore roughly flux calibrated before the indices were measured by dividing by a sensitivity function derived from a spectrum of ltt 377 taken during the same run .",
    "thus the observed and model ( see below ) indices are assumed to share essentially the same zero point which should put the abundances on a scale consistent with that used in previous analyses of other stars in this cluster .",
    "the approach we have taken is identical to that of @xcite : establishing a @xmath5/log(@xmath6 )  versus luminosity relation for a grid of model atmospheres based on an isochrone fit , then adjusting the c and n abundances of corresponding synthetic spectra to simultaneously fit the observed cn and ch band strengths .",
    "the isochrone used was that of @xcite with an alpha - element enhancement of 0.3 dex and an overall metallicity of @xmath7 .",
    "an observed distance modulus of 13.33 and a reddening of 0.04 were assumed following .",
    "the fit of the isochrone to the region of the cmd of interest is shown in figure [ fig_1 ] .",
    "for each of the program stars , a @xmath5  and log(@xmath6 )  was derived by transposing its v magnitude onto the isochrone in figure [ fig_1 ] and interpolating between grid points .",
    "these values were then used as inputs to marcs for the generation of model atmospheres .",
    "the same overall metallicity ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath8 ) as was used in previous studies of more luminous 47 tuc stars ( see * ? ? ? * ) and of m71 ms / msto stars @xcite has been employed .",
    "synthetic spectra were computed from each model atmosphere for various c and n abundances using the ssg program and the line - list of @xcite ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "a microturbulent velocity of 2  km  s@xmath4  was assumed throughout the sample , and an [ o / fe ] of + 0.45 was used ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion of the minor role o plays in setting the cn / ch band strengths of 47 tuc ms / msto stars ) .",
    "the synthetic spectra , calculated at steps of 0.05  , were convolved with a gaussian of width 4.5   to match the resolution of the observed spectra and s(3839 ) and i(ch ) indices measured from the result .",
    "sample synthetic indices appropriate to two sets of c and n abundances over the luminosity range of the present sample are shown in figure [ fig_3 ] .",
    "errors in the resulting abundances were calculated in a similar fashion using indices adjusted by the @xmath9 uncertainties from poisson statistics .    with two exceptions ( stars 4554 and 6622  the brightest and faintest star in the sample ) , all of the program star models yielded c and n abundances which simultaneously fit the observed indices to 0.005 or less ( i.e. , to within 0.01 dex in [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] , which is the limiting precision of the abundance inputs to the synthesis program ) .",
    "these values are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] . under the present method of extracting abundances , it is the v photometry of a star which is used to assign its @xmath5  and log(@xmath6 )  through fitting to the isochrone .",
    "thus , errors in the photometry as well as the assumed distance modulus will lead to differences in the derived @xmath5 , log(@xmath6 ) , and resulting abundances . fortunately , with the exception of the msto region , the change in @xmath5 , log(@xmath6 )   with v is quite gradual . as a test of this , we have recomputed the results for three pairs of cn - weak / strong stars ( one pair near the msto , one pair towards the luminous end of the ms sample , and one pair near the faint end ) assuming a distance modulus of 13.23 rather than 13.33 ( this is also equivalent to the change expected from a photometric error of 0.1 in the brightness of an individual star ) .",
    "these results are presented in table [ tbl-2 ] where it can be seen that indeed , the ms results are largely insensitive to errors in photometry / distance .    the resulting abundances ( sans stars 4554 and 6622 ) are plotted in figures [ fig_3 ] and [ fig_4 ] , where a clear c versus n anti - correlation may be seen , especially in the case of the cn - strong stars . as is cautioned by @xcite , the method employed here",
    "can naturally lead to such anti - correlations in the results ( e.g. , underestimating [ c / fe ] will naturally require larger [ n / fe ] abundances to reproduce a necessary cn band strength ) .",
    "however , the indices of figure [ fig_3 ] lead us to conclude that the anti - correlation of figure [ fig_4 ] is likely quite real .",
    "we begin with a very brief summary of what is currently known about abundance variations among low luminosity ( msto / ms ) stars in the galactic globular clusters , and in particular for 47 tuc .",
    "we consider here only such stars as they presumably reflect the compositions of cluster members before the action of any deep mixing mechanism :    \\1 ) star - to - star abundance differences have been observed among the low luminosity stars of 47 tuc , ngc 6752 , m5 , m71 , and m13 ( see above references ) . in this sense , the intra - cluster light element abundance differences between low luminosity stars appear ubiquitous among the galactic globular clusters . that similar patterns are not observed among metal - poor field stars",
    "implies that some aspect of the cluster environment plays a role .",
    "\\2 ) the pattern of the ms / msto variations exhibits the same correlations and anti - correlations expected from proton - capture nucleosynthesis , e.g. , the c - n anti - correlation ( see figure [ fig_4 ] ) , the n - na correlation of 47 tuc @xcite , and the o - na , mg - al anti - correlations of ngc 6752 and m71 .",
    "it is widely accepted that the present - day cluster ms stars are incapable of reaching the @xmath10 k temperatures required for these reactions , which necessitates a source external to the present - day stars  this consideration has lead to several so - called `` primordial enrichment scenarios . ''",
    "the most often suggested site is intermediate - mass agb stars undergoing hot bottom burning and third dredge - up ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although difficulties such as the establishment of an o - na anti - correlation remain ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "primordial scenarios include a number of possibilities as discussed in @xcite , among them : a pollution / accretion process where already formed low - mass cluster stars acquire agb ejecta at a later date , or an extended period of star formation in which some stars formed from gas already mixed with agb ejecta .",
    "of course any viable scenario of this sort must not only explain the star - to - star variations in light elements but also the remarkable consistency of heavier ( e.g. fe - peak and @xmath11-capture ) elements within the clusters , which can be a problem for some primordial theories ( such as supernovae of massive zero metallicity stars ) .",
    "\\3 ) in the case of 47 tuc and m71 , little change in the range of c and n abundances is observed from the tip of the rgb to the msto and below . this is significant as the depth of the convective envelope varies significantly over this interval ( see figure [ fig_1 ] )  from a mass fraction of 0.068 at 0.65 @xmath12 ( the lower limit of the present sample ) and 0.012 at 0.88 @xmath12 ( our upper limit ) to a maximum fraction of 0.708 on the rgb at m@xmath1 = + 1.8 @xcite . in a pollution / accretion origin , any surface contamination would therefore be diluted as the convective envelope deepens during rgb ascent , resulting in increasing c and decreasing n abundances on rgb ascent . that this is not observed then requires that a considerable fraction ( @xmath13 or more ) of the mass of a cn - strong star include captured agb ejecta . as pointed out in @xcite",
    ", a reservoir of sufficient c - poor / n - rich material may have been produced by more massive agb stars if the cluster initial mass function is less steep than a salpeter power law ( @xmath14 i.e. , @xmath15 rather than 2.35 ) , although without taking into account several other factors such as efficiency with which the low - mass stars incorporate this ejecta , @xmath15 is at best an upper limit .",
    "note also that if a substantial fraction of cluster stars were to acquire significant quantities of mass via the accretion of agb ejecta , one might expect a measurable change in the present day cluster mass function .",
    "moreover , if the accretion process is indeed tied to the dense environment of gcs as suggested by the lack of similar abundance variations among field main sequence stars , a difference in the mass functions in low density environments such as in the local group dwarf spheroidal galaxies should be present .",
    "yet the mass functions in the low - density environments of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies draco @xcite and ursa minor @xcite appear largely indistinguishable from those of at least the low - metallicity globular clusters , in conflict with the expectations from the agb ejecta scenario .",
    "however , if the accretion of cno processed material happened during the epoch of star formation , the mass function might remain unchanged .    the present results further highlight two issues in regard to such scenarios .",
    "first , the pattern of c and n abundances is the same for m71 and 47 tuc - see figure [ fig_4 ] where the c and n abundances for a sample of m71 msto / ms stars from @xcite are plotted . yet",
    "the abundances found among similar stars in m5 by @xcite show greater c depletions with similar if not smaller n enhancements among the cn - strong stars ( see also figure [ fig_4 ] ) .",
    "47 tuc and m71 have nearly identical metallicities ( [ fe / h ] @xmath16 ) , and m5 is lower ( [ fe / h ] @xmath17 ) .",
    "the question is whether we are seeing differences in the initial c and n abundances of the clusters , or a metallicity dependence in the composition of the agb - star ejecta presumed responsible for the variations among the present - day ms stars .",
    "theory certainly predicts such a dependency ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although one should also therefore expect larger n over - abundances in m5 relative to 47 tuc .",
    "clearly , without o , na , al , and/or mg abundances among such stars , and with only three clusters ( two of the same metallicity ) in the sample , little more can be said .",
    "also note that despite the similarities in msto / ms compositions , the clusters m71 and 47 tuc have very different structural properties . in the case of an origin for the cn - strong stars in material ejected from agb stars",
    ", one might expect a dependence on some aspect of the cluster environment .",
    "discuss an accretion model in which centrally concentrated clusters with high escape velocities can trap large quantities of agb - star ejecta , leading to the accretion of significant mass by low mass members passing near the cluster center before the gas is subsequently stripped during disk crossing ( as is apparently taking place in ngc 6779 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of 47 tuc",
    ", an additional 0.8@xmath12 could be accumulated by a 1@xmath12 star ( 0.4@xmath12 for m5 ) ( see their table 3 ) . yet both the central concentration and escape velocity for m71 are considerably lower ( @xmath18 = 1.15 versus 2.03 , and @xmath19 = 16.7 versus 68.8  km  s@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* respectively ) , and this process should be far less efficient in m71 - to the point of being unable to explain the @xmath13 or more accreted material required for the @xcite results .",
    "@xcite recently revisited a correlation between the fraction of cn - strong stars in a cluster and cluster ellipticity originally noted by @xcite .",
    "again , the ellipticity of m71 is 0.000 while that of 47 tuc is 0.100 ( see smith s table 1 ) .",
    "however , also note the fraction of cn - strong stars is more than two times greater in 47 tuc compared to m71 ( @xmath20 = 1.8 versus 0.7 ) .",
    "while this fraction is based on the distribution seen in larger surveys of rgb stars , neither cluster exhibits evidence of significant composition changes during rgb ascent ( see above ) , thus this ratio also likely reflects the fraction of contaminated stars on the ms .",
    "considering the similarities of such stars in 47 tuc and m71 , it would then appear that we are seeing the action of the same process , resulting in the same composition modifications - just a smaller fraction of the cluster stars were involved in m71 . as pointed out by smith",
    ", the cn - strong / ellipticity correlation may be a selection effect  the higher ellipticity clusters in the sample tend also to have higher masses ( according to the compilation of * ? ? ?",
    "* tuc has both a considerably higher velocity dispersion and a higher inferred mass than m71 ) .",
    "whether the difference between m71 and 47 tuc is the result of a smaller central reservoir of agb ejecta or less mass involved in the tail end of star formation ( and how the necessary gas could survive being blown out by supernovae ) , or some aspect of the cluster dynamics , remains to be seen .",

    "<S> we report the results of an analysis of cn and ch band strengths among a large sample of 47 tucanae main - sequence and turn - off stars presented earlier by harbeck et al . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting c and n abundances derived from synthetic spectra demonstrate : 1 ) a strongly anti - correlated relationship between [ c / fe ] and [ n / fe ] with the cn - strong stars exhibiting depleted carbon and enhanced nitrogen . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) the abundances of both elements agree remarkably well with those found among the evolved red giants of the cluster implying little change in surface abundances from at least @xmath0 to the tip of the red giant branch . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) the pattern of c - depletions and n - enhancements are quite similar to those seen among the turn - off stars of m71 , a cluster of almost identical metallicity but lower central concentration and escape velocity . at the same time , </S>",
    "<S> similar if not smaller n - enhancements and larger c - depletions are evident among like stars in the more metal - poor cluster m5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we interpret these results , as did harbeck et al . </S>",
    "<S> , as evidence of the operation of some pollution / accretion event early in the cluster history  the most likely source being agb ejecta . however , the present results rule out simple surface pollution and suggest that a substantial fraction of the present stars masses must be involved . </S>"
