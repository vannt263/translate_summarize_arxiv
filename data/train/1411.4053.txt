    "intermediate - mass ( @xmath3 ) and massive ( @xmath48  @xmath5 ) evolved stars are drivers of galaxy chemical enrichment and evolution via the return of significant amounts of gas and dust to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "this stellar mass loss also drives the subsequent evolution of the stars themselves . however , post - main sequence stellar evolution is poorly understood , especially in the short - lived dust - producing phases . and",
    "it is unclear how the galactic environment ( especially metallicity ) affects stellar dust production and evolution .",
    "dust in nearby galaxies with _ spitzer _ ( dustings ) is an infrared ( ir ) survey of 50 dwarf galaxies in and around the local group designed to detect evolved stars in the dust - producing phase .",
    "massive dusty evolved stars such as luminous blue variables , wolf - rayet stars , red supergiants , and supergiant b[e ] stars are prolific dust producers @xcite , though it is uncertain how much , if any , dust will survive the subsequent supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "the role of episodic mass loss , which is often accompanied by dust production , in the evolution of massive stars remains an open question .",
    "the inferred presence of pre - existing circumstellar material around several core - collapse sne @xcite suggests that mass loss plays an important part in stellar evolution .",
    "the dustings survey includes a large sample of nearby dwarf galaxies to increase the known sample of these short - lived stars over a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities .",
    "intermediate - mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars condense dust from material formed in situ and may be a major source of interstellar dust @xcite as inferred , for example , by the agb origin of a large fraction of presolar grains found in meteorites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several works have shown that a small population of very dusty agb stars dominate the agb dust production in the magellanic clouds at a given time @xcite .",
    "these stars ( sometimes called `` extreme '' agb stars  or x - agb stars ) are optically obscured , and are generally selected via their red colors ( @xmath6-[8 ] > 3 $ ]  mag ; see section  [ sec : xagb_class ] ) .",
    "they comprise @xmath75% of the agb population , but produce more than @xmath8 of the agb dust . through spectral energy distribution modeling , @xcite find that most of these stars in the large magellanic cloud are carbon rich .",
    "carbon stars form easily in metal - poor environments because of a low initial oxygen abundance in the circumstellar envelope and hence more free carbon after the formation of c / o ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it follows that carbon stars may also dominate the dust production in the more metal - poor dwarf galaxies .",
    "nevertheless , it is still unclear how much agb dust survives the harsh environment of the ism produced by sn shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observations of the small and large magellanic clouds ( smc / lmc ) by the surveying the agents of galaxy evolution program ( sage ; * ? ? ?",

    "estimates of the total dust input compared with other known dust sources ( i.e. , supernovae ejecta ) indicate that agb stars may be the dominant source of stellar - produced dust grains @xcite .",
    "these works also concluded that , despite their efficient dust production , agb stars can account for only a fraction of the ism dust mass in the smc and lmc .",

    "the metallicity dependence of dust production by agb stars remains unclear .",

    "other models suggest that at very low metallicity ( @xmath2 } \\lesssim -2 $ ] ) , agb stars contribute little dust and thus provide a negligible contribution to the total dust budget of high - redshift galaxies ( l. mattsson , in preparation ) .",
    "the effect of the metallicity on dust production likely differs for oxygen - rich and carbon - rich agb stars because carbon stars create their own carbon .",

    "infrared spectroscopy of o - rich agb stars in the magellanic clouds and globular clusters reveals trends consistent with reduced dust production at lower metallicities , as expected due to reduced amounts of the oxygen needed to make silicate dust , but these studies are not conclusive @xcite .",
    "in carbon stars , some works suggest there is no metallicity dependence on dust formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , while some do find hints of such a dependence at @xmath2 } \\lesssim -1 $ ] @xcite .",
    "however , this latter group includes only two c stars in the sculptor dwarf and three in leoi ( @xmath2 } = -1.68 $ ] and @xmath9 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "larger samples at low metallicities are clearly needed .",
    "the dustings survey aims to build statistics of the short - lived dust - producing phase at low metallicity for constraining stellar evolution and dust production models . here , we present an overview of the survey , which greatly extends the baseline in age and metallicity over previous observations ( table  [ tab : targets ] , fig .",

    "<S> nearby resolved dwarf galaxies provide excellent opportunities for studying the dust - producing late stages of stellar evolution over a wide range of metallicity ( @xmath0 \\lesssim -1.0 $ ] ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , we describe dustings ( dust in nearby galaxies with _ spitzer _ ) : a 3.6 and 4.5  post - cryogen _ spitzer space telescope _ imaging survey of 50 dwarf galaxies within 1.5  mpc that is designed to identify dust - producing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and massive stars . </S>",
    "<S> the survey includes 37 dwarf spheroidal , 8 dwarf irregular , and 5 transition - type galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this near - complete sample allows for the building of statistics on these rare phases of stellar evolution over the full metallicity range . </S>",
    "<S> the photometry is @xmath175% complete at the tip of the red giant branch for all targeted galaxies , with the exception of the crowded inner regions of ic10 , ngc185 , and ngc147 . </S>",
    "<S> this photometric depth ensures that the majority of the dust - producing stars , including the thermally - pulsing agb stars , are detected in each galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the images map each galaxy to at least twice the half - light radius to ensure that the entire evolved star population is included and to facilitate the statistical subtraction of background and foreground contamination , which is severe at these wavelengths . in this overview </S>",
    "<S> , we describe the survey , the data products , and preliminary results . </S>",
    "<S> we show evidence for the presence of dust - producing agb stars in 8 of the targeted galaxies , with metallicities as low as @xmath2 } = -1.9 $ ] , suggesting that dust production occurs even at low metallicity . </S>"
