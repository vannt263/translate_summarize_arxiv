    "power dissipation is a major concern in fast growing mobile applications where computations must be performed with a limited power budget .",
    "one of the fundamental issues with electronic devices is their need to move several electrons to charge / discharge a gate or a transmission line .",
    "the power dissipation in this process has been shown to be about @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the temperature , @xmath2 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath3 is the number of electrons / holes transferred and @xmath4 is the switching error probability of the device @xcite .",
    "nano - magnetic devices , on the other hand , seem to consume much less switching energy due to the ` self - correcting ' effect @xcite , where their internal exchange coupling bundles the electron spins and allows them to act as a single entity while simultaneously providing resilience against noise .",
    "the minimum energy consumption from the switching of a nanomagnet ( i.e. , a collection of spins ) is estimated to be on the order of @xmath5 which is significantly lower than that in electronic devices for comparable number of information carriers @xcite .    in the past decade , nanomagnetic devices have started to carve out a space for themselves as good candidates for memory applications due to the nonvolatility of magnets .",
    "stt - ram has been touted as the solid - state ` universal memory ' device @xcite that can flatten the register - cache - ram - storage hierarchy due to its high scalability , almost limitless endurance , beol integrability in standard cmos manufacturing process , and relatively high speed and low dissipation .",
    "uncertain future of flash memory @xcite has opened a possible market for stt - ram to be the choice of storage in embedded and mobile applications , and perhaps even in cloud computing as large scale , high speed , low power data - caches .",
    "though challenges remain , especially in scaling up the production which ultimately lowers the barrier of entry into the market for stt - rams , recent developments @xcite have shown a great promise for the large scale commercialization of the technology .",
    "a rich variety of magnetic switching phenomena have appeared recently on the horizon , such as spin transfer torque ( stt ) , spin - hall effect , skyrmions , multiferroics , and voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy ( vcma ) .",
    "this has led to the exploration of nanomagnetic devices beyond memory applications .",
    "there are efforts to build and evaluate spin based logic devices exploiting unique features such as in - situ memory through non - volatility , stochastic computing , oscillators and magnetic neurons .",
    "while it is not clear how many of these ideas will see eventual adoption as functional devices in commercial production , it is imperative to understand the fundamental limits to the performance of these devices , and develop methods to overcoming these challenges based on the physics and properties of the materials and phenomena underlying the nano - magnets and their interactions .",
    "this paper presents a detailed exposition of an integrated multi - scale approach , starting from materials and going all the way up to circuits and systems that can answer these questions and provide an ideal platform for exploration of this technology .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 lays out a bird s eye view of the fundamental challenges underlying all nano - magnetic devices , and indeed any novel technology in terms of the read , write , reliability metrics of performance .",
    "section 3 introduces the integrated multi - scale dft - to - spice approach .",
    "section 4 presents a density functional theory ( dft ) based approach to search for materials with desired properties that improve the read performance .",
    "section 5 and 6 cover the physics of charge and spin - transport in these devices using the non - equlibrium green s functions ( negf ) formalism and the interaction of the nano - magnets with charge and spin currents through the stochastic landau - lifshitz - glibert - slonczewski ( llgs ) equation . section 7 reviews the physics , benefits , and challenges associated with a select few emerging mechanisms for magnetic switching which may complement or supplant the classic spin - torque based switching .",
    "section 8 reviews and connects the various pieces developed in sections 3 through 7 and presents an integrated workflow .",
    "section 9 connects the fundamental physics based approaches developed in the previous sections to spice based simulations and illustrates the capabilities of the approach through a few example simulations .",
    "finally we summarize in section 10 .",
    "over the last decade , nanomagnetic devices , especially sttrams have seen considerable progress in optimizing size , switching time , energy efficiency , and overall reliability .",
    "major challenges still exist , such as in the scalability of magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) . in the meantime ,",
    "new device ideas have emerged which could potentially reduce energy dissipation nearer to or even below existing charge based technologies , with the added advantage of non - volatility .",
    "understanding the issues for each device in an overall computational architecture requires a holistic analysis , spanning a complex multi - dimensional phase space defined by size , energy budget , desired speed and a target read - write - retention error rate . in the following sections , we will review those challenges from the read , write , and reliability points of view .",
    "the ability to read the state of a magnet , say an mtj , depends on its overall tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) that quantifies the electrical distinguishability of its two binary states .",
    "this ratio would have been infinite if each magnet contained only one spin species ( up or down ) within the bias range of interest ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mtjhalfmetal ] ) . a tmr ratio defined as",
    "@xmath6 quantifies the readability of the mtj , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the junction resistances in the low resistance ( parallel ) vs high resistance ( antiparallel ) configurations . by passing a small current @xmath9 through the mtj and comparing the voltage drop against a reference value",
    ", we can identify the magnetic configuration of the mtj .",
    "a high tmr ratio is needed to provide enough sensing margin @xmath10 , without the need to inject a large dissipative and disruptive read current that can alter the state of the magnets .",
    "past research has shown high tmr ratios ( as high as @xmath11 ) for fe / mgo or feco / mgo junctions at room temperature @xcite , building on the predicted symmetry filtering of mgo and half - metallicity of fe and feco ( predictions exceed 4000@xmath12 at low bias ) . however , in state - of - art mtjs where the write current is optimized , the tmr ratio hardly exceeds @xmath13 .",
    "this degradation may arise from the shrinking thickness of mgo and from spin depolarization by defects like oxygen vacancies sitting near the interfaces between the spacer and the magnetic layers @xcite .",
    "improved fabrication processes plus a comprehensive materials study are needed to enhance the tmr ratio for better readability in mtjs .",
    "although the intrinsic energy dissipation of magnetization switching is low , the energy required to generate the means to flip a magnet is not .",
    "for instance , the traditional way of manipulating a magnet is with a magnetic field , which is generated using a current carrying wire which dissipates considerable energy .",
    "furthermore , the field - switching scheme is not scalable ; scaling down the magnet reduces its overall magnetic moment , which needs to be compensated by increasing the anisotropy to retain spins for a long enough time .",
    "toggle magnetic switching depends on the anisotropy , needing therefore a larger current for smaller magnets . in comparison ,",
    "stt switching offers a scalable solution since the critical switching current needed to switch a perpendicular magnet depends on the overall energy barrier ( i.e. , magnetization @xmath14 volume @xmath14 anisotropy field ) , which is held fixed during scaling to achieve a target retention time . as we argue later",
    ", the typical current density required to switch a magnet in nanoseconds is on the order of @xmath15 , because the spins needed to flip the magnetization need to come from individual electrons .",
    "this large current , combined with the large resistance of the tunnel junction , dissipates around @xmath16 energy per bit , which is still about two orders of magnitude higher than the switching energy in present day silicon based complementary metal oxide semiconductor ( cmos ) technology , and five to six orders larger than the energy barrier for retention . besides energy dissipation",
    ", there is a concern about how to supply the required large number of charges from a transistor of similar size - basically an impedance matching issue .",
    "an alternate stt driven nanomagnetic device , the magnetic domain wall based racetrack memory , reduces the resistance by using all metallic structures and separating the read and write paths , but it suffers from even larger current thresholds ( @xmath17 ) because the @xmath18 sized domains tend to get pinned by notches and defects along the transport pathway @xcite .",
    "the efforts to reduce the write current can be summarized into three categories .",
    "the first direction involves lowering the critical current required to flip a magnet . in this category , researchers try to dynamically lower the energy barrier that separates different magnetic states .",
    "examples are the adoption of perpendicular magneto - anisotropy ( pma ) @xcite and more recently the study of voltage controlled magneto - anisotropy ( vcma ) @xcite .",
    "similar efforts are seen in the domain wall based devices , where researchers are proposing to replace domains with small @xmath19 nm sized magnetic skyrmions that need orders of magnitude lower current threshold ( @xmath20 ) @xcite for depinning . however , the low current density comes with a price of low operational speed and will need to be exploited judiciously .",
    "the second direction is to enhance the charge to spin conversion efficiency for better torque . in usual",
    "two terminal mtjs , the spin current is generated by polarizing the electrons that flow through the junction .",
    "the spin to charge ratio @xmath21 normally can not exceed @xmath13 .",
    "one way to break this ceiling is to exploit the giant spin hall effect ( gshe ) based on strong spin - orbit coupling in heavy metals like ta , pt , w or topological insulators ( ti ) .",
    "when an in - plane charge current flows on a metallic film , the spin - orbit coupling generates a spin current that flows perpendicular to the charge current . the spin hall angle @xmath22 characterizes the intrinsic conversion between spin and charge in those systems , which usually ranges from 0.08 to 0.3 @xcite .",
    "placing an mtj on top of the heavy metal provides an added gain @xmath23 with a geometrical factor @xmath24 representing multiple incidences along the skipping orbits over the length of the target soft magnet in the mtj ( @xmath25 is the thickness of the metal film and @xmath26 is the length of the magnet along the direction of the charge current ) .",
    "a similar setup can be used on 3d topological insulators like @xmath27 , which have potentially higher @xmath28 $ ] @xcite for surface conduction and may be enhanced by using gated p - n junctions @xcite . finally the third approach is to control the magnetization entirely through an applied electric field , minimizing the energy dissipation that would arise with any steady flow of charge current .",
    "examples here are strain based switching in multiferroic systems .",
    "recent research has experimentally demonstrated magnetization switching in both single phase multiferroic materials @xcite as well as composite structures @xcite .",
    "a winning combination could well involve a hybrid switching scheme combining multiple of these methods , such as mixing the directionality of spin torque with the energetics of strain .",
    "the various switching mechanisms will be reviewed in detail in section  [ sec : emerging_device ] .",
    "both memory and logic applications need reliable switching to different degrees . for readout , the read current @xmath9 needs to be kept small to prevent an accidental switching due to the read disturb . for a write operation , apart from the device - to - device variations , conventional stt switching suffers from a problem with ` stagnation ' . when the two magnetic layers have precisely collinear ( parallel or anti - parallel ) magnetic moments , their torque vanishes , whereupon we rely on slow thermal fluctuations to kick the magnetic moment out of this stagnation , which is thus a major source of soft write error . to maintain ultra - low write error rates ,",
    "much larger overdrive currents are needed beyond the critical current @xmath29 for destabilizing the spins",
    ". however , large write currents dissipate more energy and pose a risk of time - dependent dielectric breakdown for mtjs . emerging switching schemes such as vcma and straintronics can avoid large current ( or no current at all ) but their write error rates are still too high for practical memory / logic devices . for memory applications ,",
    "the nanomagnets also need enough energy barrier ( @xmath30 ) to meet the 10 year retention time target .",
    "maintaining enough anisotropy in ultrascaled magnets is hard and requires precise material and interface engineering .",
    "to understand and resolve these challenges , a holistic approach is needed that goes all the way from the material physics to the circuit performance . in an earlier article @xcite we laid the groundwork , basic equations , derivations and key concepts underlying this approach .",
    "our focus there was on the physics behind switching - the torque and its voltage asymmetry , symmetry filtering by mgo , the resulting high tmr and its depolarization by oxygen vacancies , and ` first principles ' spin torques based on density functional theory ( dft ) for various materials .",
    "the aim of this review article is to focus on the device performance end - i.e. , evaluate a few proposals to mitigate challenges at every level , from material to device to circuit .",
    "fig.[fig : multiscale ] illustrates the multi - scale computational approach . at the material level",
    ", we describe the electronic bandstructure of the magnetic contact using atomistic density functional theory ( dft ) , or a phenomenological continuum model with well benchmarked parameters .",
    "these bandstructures allow us to navigate a large phase space of unexplored magnetic materials beyond a few mature material systems , sometimes with opposite design criteria .",
    "for example , stt devices need a high spin polarization , low damping and low saturation magnetization for efficient current induced switching , and a high magneto - anisotropy to maintain adequate energy barrier for retention . for voltage driven switching in multiferroic materials on the other hand , we need a low anisotropy field to write easily along the hard axis , and a correspondingly high saturation magnetization to restore the energy barrier . in section [",
    "sec : heusler ] , we will discuss an example of material engineering involving a high throughput computational study on the heusler compounds to identify materials with high spin polarization , and layered heuslers to engineer added magnetic anisotropy .",
    "the transport module calculates the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics and the spin transfer torque from the magnet and oxide bandstructures - atomistic or continuum . ballistic transport in mtjs can be calculated using the non - equilibrium green s function ( negf ) method ( section [ sec : transport ] ) @xcite , whereas spin transport across larger films such as gshe or topological insulator surface states are described by spin diffusion models .",
    "the spin torque is then fed into a magnetodynamics module while the current - voltage ( i - v ) can be parameterized and used in circuit simulations . some emerging devices such as those based on multiferroics or skyrmions in magnetic insulators@xcite , may not need a charge current . in those cases ,",
    "the coupling between the ferromagnetic and ferroelectric orders can be extracted from material modeling and directly fed into the micromagnetic simulations .    at the magneto - dynamic level",
    ", the stochastic landau lifshitz gilbert slonczewski ( llgs ) equation describes the dynamics of small magnets in the presence of current driven torque and thermal noise , while the corresponding fokker - planck equation directly calculates the nonequilibrium spin probability distribution .",
    "further complications can arise from transient dynamics that may involve incoherent switching with sub - volume excitations .",
    "we discuss stochastic magnetization switching in section [ sec : reliability ] .",
    "finally at the highest level , simple compact models ( section [ sec : analy_modular ] ) , or more general modular circuit models ( section [ sec : circuit_modular ] ) incorporating material parameters can be used to simulate a complex architecture and study the interactions among various devices in the circuit .",
    "such a modular approach relies on kirchhoff s laws for charge current and their relations with the non - conservative spin currents .",
    "ultimately , the merit of this unified toolbox is that it connects the material study all the way to the device / circuit performance metrics approaching a system level analysis , or vice versa - reverse engineering from desired performance criteria back to material optimization .",
    "the development of novel materials is critical to attaining a high tmr ratio beyond @xmath13 .",
    "this requires a highly spin - polarized magnetic layer in an mtj .",
    "one type of material predicted to have high spin - polarization is a half - metal in which the electronic structure of one of the spin channels is metallic while the other is semiconducting .",
    "for fe and feco , this happens to be the @xmath31 band with orbital symmetry given by s , p@xmath32 and d@xmath33 along the transport z direction .",
    "thus an extremely large tmr is expected to occur in mtj using half - metals as electrode materials , coupled with mgo which filters out other non-@xmath31 bands through orbital symmetry .",
    "the high tmr follows from the fact that electron tunneling is significantly reduced in the anti - parallel magnetization configuration and reliant on minority spin tunneling .",
    "although a large number of half - metals have been predicted by first - principles calculations @xcite , these discoveries appear to occur mainly through serendipity .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear which of the many half - metals that can be imagined , are stable .",
    "thus , a systematic study of the structural stability of half - metals should provide guidance for future experiments . here",
    "we describe a rational approach to design body - center cubic ( bcc ) half - metallic structures called  heusler compounds\"@xcite .",
    "we also investigate the stability of these compounds through the calculation of their formation energies and the comparison of these calculated energies to the calculated energies of other possible phases , and combinations of phases @xcite .",
    "to explain the origin of half - metals in the heusler family , we need to start from a 1d atomic system with two different atoms , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as shown in fig.[fig:1dchain ] .",
    "we assume different on - site energies of the orbitals for @xmath34 sites and @xmath35 sites , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , respectively .",
    "if we only consider the first - nearest - neighbor interaction , the 1d atomic chain can be described by the tight - binding hamiltonian for the periodic array of dimers :    @xmath39\\{\\psi\\}_{n}-[\\beta]\\{\\psi\\}_{n+1}-[\\beta]^{\\dagger}\\{\\psi\\}_{n-1}\\\\ [ \\alpha]&=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } e_{x } & -t\\\\ -t & e_{y } \\end{array}\\right],[\\beta]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 0\\\\ t & 0 \\end{array}\\right ] \\end{aligned } \\label{eq:1dchain}\\ ] ]     atom sits on one sub - lattice and type @xmath35 atom sits on the other .",
    "there is only nearest neighbor interaction and the interaction is represented by the hopping parameter @xmath40    [ fig:1dchain ]    where @xmath41 is the coupling between nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "assuming periodic boundary conditions and invoking a plane wave solution ( bloch s theorem ) @xmath42 , we can get a band gap extending from @xmath36 to @xmath37 with bandgap @xmath43 .",
    "this gap is independent of the hopping term , @xmath41 , letting us easily extend the 1d chain to 3d body - center cubic b2 structures@xcite .",
    "b2 structure can be viewed as alternate atomic layers along ( 001 ) direction only with nearest neighbor interactions ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2toinverse](b ) ) , but there are no intra - layer interactions .",
    "this means that the wave vector perpendicular to the ( 001 ) plane , @xmath44 , generates an @xmath45 expression identical to the 1-d dimer @xmath45 expression above , resulting in a gap between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "since the gap between @xmath36 and @xmath37 is not dependent on @xmath46 , the gap will remain after integration over @xmath46 . in order to create half - metallic ferromagnets ,",
    "we can select different transition metal elements with @xmath47orbitals on the @xmath34 and @xmath35 sites . as long as the interactions are restricted to nearest neighbors",
    ", we can predict that there is still a gap between the onsite energy for the @xmath34 sites and the onsite energy for the @xmath35 sites for a b2 structure .",

    "x@xmath49 and x@xmath51 have the same transition metal elements and their valence smaller than y. ]    if we assume the onsite energy is determined primarily by the onsite electron number , then we see that the system can lower its energy if it enhances the size of the gap by increasing the difference in the number of electrons for @xmath34 and @xmath35 atoms , so that the fermi energy falls inside the gap .",
    "the outermost electronic states that participate in hybridization in b2 compounds are a single @xmath55 and five @xmath56 orbitals , so we have nearly six bonding states below the fermi energy . in other words , there are a total of six electrons in the gapped spin channel .",
    "we thus end up with an approximate thumb rule for these compounds : in the gapped spin channel , the approximate electron count on alternate atoms @xmath34 and @xmath35 must be four and two ( the ` 4 - 2 ' rule ) @xcite . if the total valence electron number is twelve , it is easy then to create a semiconductor since each spin channel has six electrons . by making the total valence electron number larger ( or smaller )",
    "than 12 , the majority ( or minority ) spin channel will now be doped to be metallic , while the other spin channel remains semiconducting since the fermi energy falls in the gap .    while the above design rule seems compelling ,",
    "first principles calculations indicate that the b2 structure only achieves a pseudogap instead of a true gap .",
    "this is because of residual next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) interactions @xcite that were not included in our consideration so far . to reduce the nnn interactions",

    "for the pseudogapped channel , the `` 4 - 2 rule '' forces @xmath34 atoms ( fe or co ) to hold 4 electrons and @xmath35 atoms hold 2 electrons . as we replace one mn or ti with a si spacer , the pseudogaps in b2 systems turn into real gaps , resulting in the half - metal co@xmath51mnsi and semiconducting fe@xmath51tisi .",
    "for these two full - heusler compounds , the spacer si atom also holds 2 electrons in the gapped channels to sustain the ` 4 - 2 ' rule .",

    "as the fermi energy falls in the gap , there are a total of @xmath68 states being filled in this spin channel ( as shown in fig.[fig:18states ] ) .",
    "since the spin moment per atom is just the difference in the number of up and down electrons per atom ( @xmath69 ) , and since @xmath70 , with 9 states fully occupied in the gapped channel ( @xmath71 ) we get the simple ` rule of 18 for half - metallicity in half - heusler compounds : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total magnetic moment and @xmath74 is the total number of valence electrons per _ xyz _ formula unit . if the total valence electron number is 18 , the system will tend to be semiconducting with 9 electrons under the fermi energy per spin channel .",

    ", we illustrate the principles behind the spintronic stochastic switching and computation using a variant of the spin - switch design . for this example",
    ", we lower the anisotropy barrier of the nanomagnet in the spin - switch from @xmath271 to @xmath275 , which can be achieved with a superparamagnet . from eq .",
    "[ eq : tau_magnet ] , the lower energy barrier reduces the device retention from a decade to a few ns .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the statistical mean of the output voltage can be controlled by a spin - current , which produces a device characteristic that resembles a sigmoid function(see fig.[fig : stochastic]a .",
    "the blue background is the noisy instantaneous response as the input current is swept , while the red is a sampled mean produced through a @xmath276 network acting as a low pass filter . )",
    "connecting these devices together with controllable interaction through spin current allows us to form restricted boltzmann machines ( a class of stochastic recurrent neural networks ) that can learn and reproduce patterns through annealing .",
    "the stochasticity of the superparamagnets is advantageous in scanning the phase space at ghz frequencies and reaching the ground state ( solution state ) quickly during the annealing process .",
    "a proof - of - concept example of the annealing process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stochastic]b , where a circuit built from 3 stochastic spin - switches forms a 3-node ising network .",
    "the connections among them can be weighted by an external circuitry independent from the spin - switches . some possible ways to implement the weighted connections are voltage controlled resistors such as memristors , bias voltages on the spin - switches themselves , or an external cmos based circuitry @xcite . in this example ,",
    "the magnitudes of the weights are chosen to give strong connections that can drive the devices unambiguously into the saturation regions in fig.[fig : stochastic]a .",
    "when the signs of the connections are all positive , the interaction type is ferromagnetic and therefore after annealing , those devices prefer @xmath277 and @xmath278 states equally , with very low probability to choose other states . on the other hand ,",
    "if the interactions are negative ( anti - ferromagnetic ) the networks settle into a frustrated spin - glass state ( fig.[fig : stochastic]c ) .    with this type of network ,",
    "it is possible to compute any logic function by adjusting the interactions to encode the desired answer or truth table into its eigenstates , which the network can find quickly through the annealing process .",
    "an example is to solve a travelling salesman problem ( a classic np - complete problem ) with an ising network demonstrated in ref .",
    "another example is to implement a 32-bit ripple carry adder with functional complementarity discussed in ref .",

    "the purpose of this section is to demonstrate the capabilities of the integrated dft to spice approach presented in this paper that allows us to directly connect the physics of the materials to the performance of functional memory and logic devices as well as explore novel circuit applications enabled by these materials .",
    "traditional stt - rams have already started commercializing to some extent .",
    "the continual improvement in the material engineering and fabrication process will promise better device performance in terms of the read - write - reliability metrics , which makes it a competitive candidate in memory applications .",
    "following these efforts , we have summarized the computational tools that facilitate the material study and demonstrated a wide range of material choices in the heusler family with the potential to improve the performance of mtjs at scaled nodes .",
    "we have also illustrated the importance of the thermal noise in magnetization switching and how to characterize its effect using the llgs and fokker - planck methods .",
    "a proper engineering of the nanomagnet ( such as tilted magnetic moment ) can mitigate some negative effects from the thermal noise .",
    "however , the low power dissipation goal promised by nano - magnetics can hardly be achieved in conventional magnetic tunnel junction structure with spin transfer torque switching . on the one hand , emerging device ideas such as gshe bring new hope toward energy efficient operations of nanomagnetic devices in traditional applications . on the other hand ,",
    "a paradigm shift towards non - boolean computation might bring nanomagnetic into new application realms such as probabilistic computing , neuromorphic computing and etc . in any case , a comprehensive understanding of a nanomagnetic device - from its material to its circuit performance is necessary to be able to optimize it to meet the requirements of different applications . to do that",
    ", we have shown an integrated framework that connects the material properties to the circuit performance and illustrated it with different devices such as the stt - ram and the spin - switch .",
    "each part of the toolbox is general enough to be extended to study other device ideas .",
