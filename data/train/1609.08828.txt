    "note that such quivers are _ mutation - finite _",
    "( i.e. , their mutation classes are finite ) .",
    "there is a model for mutations of quivers containing a representative without oriented cycles in their mutation class ( such quivers are called _ mutation - acyclic _ ) : it was shown in  @xcite that mutations of mutation - acyclic quivers can be modeled by reflections of a tuple of positive vectors in a certain quadratic space ( we call this a _ realization by reflections _ ) .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to construct a model for mutations of _ mutation - cyclic _ quivers of rank @xmath0 ( see section  [ s - def ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "mutation classes of rank @xmath0 quivers were studied in  @xcite . in particular , the _ markov constant _",

    ", the markov constant also controls the signature of the quadratic space where the mutations are modeled by reflections .",

    "a classification of mutation - finite quivers with integer weights in rank @xmath0 is extremely simple : there are two quivers in the mutation class of an orientation of @xmath26 dynkin diagram , two quivers in the mutation class of an acyclic orientation of @xmath27 extended dynkin diagram , and the markov quiver .",
    "however , in the case of real weights the question is more interesting .",

    "finally , we observe that the structure of acyclic representatives in mutation classes of quivers with real weights is very different from one in integer case .",
    "according to  @xcite , all acyclic representatives in any integer mutation class can be mutated to each other via source - sink mutations only , i.e. by mutations which just reverse directions of arrows incident to the mutation vertex .",
    "this is not the case for quivers with real weights : already finite mutation classes may have two essentially distinct acyclic representatives ( see table  [ finite ] ) , and infinite mutation classes have infinitely many ones . moreover , we prove even stronger statement .",

    "table  [ finite ] shows that the structure of acyclic representatives in mutation classes of quivers with real weights is very different from one we are used to see in integer case",
    ". in particular , there may be acyclic representatives in the same mutation class which differ much more than just by a sequence of sink / source mutations .",
    "[ line ] let @xmath21 be a mutation - acyclic quiver with @xmath394 . then iterating mutations @xmath146 and @xmath84 ( so that @xmath214 and the weight @xmath384 are always preserved ) , one can always reach an acyclic representative in at most @xmath395 mutations .",
    "consider a realization @xmath396 of @xmath6 by reflections and consider the triples of lines obtained from @xmath396 by mutations @xmath146 and @xmath84 applied alternately ( see fig .",
    "[ irr ] ) .",
    "if @xmath153 consecutive sectors cover the whole angle @xmath397 around the common point @xmath343 of @xmath208 and @xmath207 , then at least one of the corresponding @xmath398 triples is acute - angled ( one can draw the line through @xmath343 orthogonal to @xmath214 and take the two mutations of @xmath208 and @xmath207 composing smallest angles with it ) .    since @xmath399",
    ", we can take @xmath153 to be equal to @xmath400 .",
    "as one needs to make @xmath401 mutations to obtain all the @xmath402 triples that produce @xmath153 sectors covering @xmath397 , the number of required mutations is then does not exceed @xmath395 .",
    "consider the realization @xmath396 of @xmath6 by reflections .",
    "as @xmath20 , this realization is a configuration of @xmath0 lines on a sphere . by lemma  [ line ] , it is sufficient to show the angles in the realization of other quivers in the mutation class can not be too small .",
    "we will show that they can not become smaller than @xmath403 .    to show this we follow the same ideas as in the proof of lemma  [ lambda ] .",
    "namely , we choose a triangle bounded by @xmath396 and denote the lengths of its sides by @xmath279 and the opposite angles by @xmath404 .",
    "then we show that @xmath405 here all but the last equalities follow from the spherical sine law , and the last equality follows from spherical second cosine law @xmath406 while taking in mind that @xmath407 in particular , we see that @xmath408      there is no counterpart of theorem  [ acyclic in s ] for the case of @xmath410 ( i.e. for euclidean and hyperbolic realizations ) .",
    "indeed , take any triple of lines @xmath396 in @xmath17 , where @xmath208 and @xmath207 form a @xmath1-irrational angle @xmath323 .",
    "then one can use mutations @xmath146 and @xmath84 to obtain a triple of lines with ( at least one ) arbitrary small angle . repeating the same but now centered in the smallest angle",
    ", we can get a triple of lines with two angles arbitrary small ( and thus the third one arbitrary close to @xmath1 ) , i.e. a triple of almost collinear lines .",
    "it is easy to see that this can not be turned into an acute - angled configuration in a predefined number of mutations ."
