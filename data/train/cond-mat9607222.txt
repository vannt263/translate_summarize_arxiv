    "this paper considers the corresponding _ dynamics _ , using one of the simplest lattice statistical models : the dimer covering of the square lattice@xcite .",
    "the dimers are placed on the bonds and every site must be touched by exactly one dimer .",
    "( this is equivalent , of course , to the packings of `` dominoes '' of size @xmath2 @xcite ; furthermore the ground states of the fully frustrated ising model on the square lattice  @xcite map 2-to-1 to the dimer coverings . in this paper ,",
    "i only consider the case where each packing has equal weight .",
    "the system is taken to be a square of @xmath3 sites with periodic boundary conditions for the dimers .",
    "the statics can be described by mappings to free fermions , and exact solutions are possoble using pfaffians @xcite or transfer matrices @xcite .",
    "there is a nonzero ground state entropy of 0.2916 per site @xcite .",
    "the correlation functions are critical  @xcite ( power - law decaying ) .",
    "this is easiest understood after mapping the dimer packings ( configuration - by - configuration ) to configurations of `` heights '' @xmath4 living on dual lattice sites , @xmath5 , representing a rough interface in an 3-dimensional abstract space @xcite .",
    "when such a model is endowed with dynamics , a central question is how the equilibration time @xmath6 ( to be defined shortly ) scales as a function of the system diameter @xmath7 ?",
    "in particular , what is the dynamic exponent @xmath8 @xcite in @xmath9 ?",
    "since the static continuum model has a gradient - squared free energy , one would suspect that @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , scaling with @xmath10 has been seen numerically in simulations of the square lattice dimer model@xcite .",
    "( it has also been seen in antiferromagnetic ising models@xcite and random - tiling quasicrystal models@xcite with height representations . )",
    "however , it has only been proven @xcite that ( with our definition of time scale ) @xmath11 ) , which implies @xmath12 .",
    "this paper has two aims : ( i ) an explicit approximate description of the slowest eigenmodes of the time evolution , based on continuum theory  this theory is applicable , with small changes , to any height model ; ( ii ) the outline of a proof that @xmath13 ( and hence @xmath14 . ) the    the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "the remainder of this section specifies the model , in particular the height mapping and dimer - flip stochastic dynamics , and also points out an exact correspondence of the _ entire spectrum _ of the quantum dimer model to that of this dynamics .",
    "i then take up a continuum model in terms of the height representation ( secs .",
    "[ cont ] ) which is defined by standard langevin dynamics , verifying that this is the appropriate coarse - graining of the microscopics .",
    "this produces an approximate description of _ all _ the slow eigenmodes ( secs",
    ".  [ cont ] and  [ rwalk ] ) .",
    "intriguingly , the slowest mode in any finite - size system is _ not _ the longest - wavelength capillary wave , but a `` height - shift '' mode involving diffusion of the system - wide average `` height '' direction ( sec .",
    "[ rwalk ] ) .",
    "finally ( in sec .",
    "[ micro ] ) i explain how rigorous bounds on the dynamics can be proven .",
    "the fundamental concepts for this proof are ( i ) the use of fourier analysis to partially diagonalize the evolution matrix @xmath15 , ( ii ) constructing variational `` wavefunctions '' guided by the results of the earlier sections , and ( iii ) taking advantage of the fourier spectrum of height fluctuations derivable from the exact solution of the model . in the conclusion ,",
    "i mention other spin models to which these results should be relevant .",
    "the explicit rule for constructing a height pattern @xmath16 , given a snapshot of the dimers , is shown in fig . 1 : @xmath17 if there is a dimer between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , or @xmath20 if there is no dimer , where the step from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is taken in a counterclockwise sense about the even sites .",
    "the net height difference is zero for the path around one plaquette , and hence by induction for any closed path , showing the consistency of the definition .",
    "however , it is nonunique in that adding the same constant to each @xmath4 makes an equally valid height representation of the same dimer configuration ; i shall fix this constant after defining the dynamics ( below ) .",
    "it is necessary in writing the continuum model for @xmath4 ( e.g. to define its fourier transform ) that @xmath4 satisfy periodic boundary conditions ; but periodic boundary conditions for dimers only imply @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where the `` winding numbers '' @xmath23 and @xmath24 are multiples of 4 , so that the system has a mean tilt is @xmath25 .",
    "_ local _ update rules ( such as i am about to define ) conserve the winding numbers .",
    "thus one could define substracted heights @xmath26 which do satisfy periodic boundary conditions . in the limit of small tilts , @xmath27 would obey the same continuum dynamics .",
    ", the free - energy functional ( [ freee ] ) must be generalized to have different stiffnesses for components of the gradient parallel to and transverse to the tilt direction ; the same power laws for the dynamics would be deduced . ]",
    "this trivial generalization is not worth the added complication in notation ; in the remaining sections i will only configurations with @xmath28    the ground states of the fully - frustrated ising model on the square lattice may be mapped ( 2-to-1 ) to dimer coverings of the dual square lattice .",
    "the rule is : simply draw a dimer across every violated bond .",
    "therefore that model has a height representation and all my results apply equally to the fully - frustrated ising model .",
    "the height variable will play the role of the `` order parameter '' in this paper .",
    "the more customary order parameter , for _ any _ of the height models , is a spin operator @xmath29 ( or a dimer occupation operator , in the present case ) .",
    "however , as outlined in appendix  [ spincorr ] ) , such an @xmath29 is simply a sinusoidal function of the local height .",
    "since the long - distance and long - time height fluctuations discussed here are gaussian , it is possible from them to compute the correlations of @xmath29 which turn out to be algebraic with nonuniversal exponents .",
    "it is possible to turn any dimer covering ( of zero mean tilt ) into any other one by a succession of `` dimer flips '' each affecting two dimers on opposite edges of one plaquette ( see fig .",
    "thus the model is endowed with a stochastic ( monte carlo ) dynamics in continuous time as follows : select plaquettes at random , at a rate @xmath0 per unit time where @xmath30 is the number of sites ( i.e. on average visit each plaquette once per unit time ) .",
    "flip the plaquette if it has two dimers as in fig .",
    "1(b ) , otherwise do nothing .",
    "on the other hand , the natural zero - temperature dynamics of the fully frustrated ising model is to choose a spin at random and flip it if the energy change would be zero , otherwise do nothing .",
    "this induces exactly the same dynamics on the dimer configurations as specified in the preceding paragraph .    to eliminate the arbitrariness in defining @xmath4 and ensure that the coarse - grained dynamics is continuous in time",
    ", we relate @xmath31 at different times , by specifying that a dimer flip on a plaquette changes only the @xmath4 value in that plaquette s center .",
    "( notice that the possible @xmath4 values on a particular site can only differ from the initial value by a multiple of 4 ; the values of @xmath32 define four fixed , square sublattices.@xcite ) .",
    "now let @xmath33 be the probability of being in microstate @xmath34 at time @xmath35 .",
    "the master equation states @xmath36 where @xmath37 means summing over configurations @xmath38 which differ from @xmath34 by one dimer flip ; thus    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the adjacency matrix ( elements unity if @xmath34 and @xmath38 are related by a flip , and zero otherwise ) , and @xmath41 is the number of `` flippable '' plaquettes in configuration @xmath34 .",
    "these matrices are @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the number of microstates .",
    "it is well known that the matrix @xmath15 has nonnegative eigenvalues ( via the perron - frobenius theorem , since @xmath15 is a stochastic matrix ) .",
    "the eigenvector of zero eigenvalue is @xmath44 , the weight of the ( equilibrium ) steady state ( which is unique , since dimer flips connect all microstates ) .",
    "furthermore , any time correlation function in the system can be resolved into a sum over eigenvalues @xmath45 of @xmath15 , in the form @xmath46 then it is normal to define the system s equilibration time @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the smallest nonzero relaxation rate .",
    "the equilibration time @xmath6 of the system is defined as the inverse of the second smallest eigenvalue of @xmath15 .      in the quantum dimer model",
    ", the basis states are taken to be the dimer coverings , and the hamiltonian is taken to have matrix elements @xmath49 the first term describes dimer flips  like a particle quantum `` hopping '' with amplitude @xmath35 on the microstate graph ; the second term is a `` potential energy '' which penalizes each flippable plaquette .    when @xmath50 , obviously @xmath51 ref .",
    "@xcite noted that ( [ h - w ] ) implies the ground state wavefunction of ( [ qdimer ] ) is a superposition of all the dimer packings with equal amplitudes .",
    "in other words , that ( quantum ) wavefunction is proportional to the steady - state probabilities of the ( classical ) dynamics ( [ master ] ) .    here",
    "i note that ( [ h - w ] ) further implies a one - to - one correspondence of _ all _ the eigenstates of ( [ qdimer ] ) to normal modes of the master equation .",
    "thus the bounds derived in this paper for the slowest relaxation rate are equally valid for the energy gap in the quantum model , and the approximate eigenfunctions and eigenvalues found in secs .",
    "[ cont ] and  [ rwalk ] also describe the low - energy spectrum of the quantum dimer model .",
    "this section develops the continuum ( `` coarse - grained '' ) version of the dynamics . in this form",
    "the model has an easily visualized physical meaning and ( being linear ) is solvable by standard and almost trivial techniques . in general ,",
    "the slowest modes are associated with relaxation of the `` order parameter '' @xcite ; in the dimer covering model , the height variable plays the role of a ( hidden ) order parameter , so the dynamics are phrased in terms of it .",

    "the only specific information from the dimer model is the numerical value of the elastic constant @xmath53 and of the height space lattice constant @xmath54 , which are also known for many other height models .",
    "first i review the coarse - grained picture of the height dynamics .",

    "( from here on i assume zero net tilt of @xmath4 and of @xmath56 so these variables satisfy periodic boundary conditions . )",
    "the fact that the dimer model is rough ( described by ( [ freee ] ) is nontrivial : several other height models , defined in similar ways , are found to be smooth@xcite in which the interface turns out to be smooth , or marginal .",
    "the roughness is confirmed only through the calculation in app .",
    "[ static ] .",
    "the customary dynamics for such a field theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is formulated as a langevin equation , @xmath57 here @xmath52 is the kinetic ( damping ) constant measuring the linear - response to the force @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is a random source of gaussian noise , uncorrelated in space or in time . in order",
    "that eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) have for its steady state @xmath60 with @xmath61 given by eq .",
    "( [ freee ] ) , the usual condition @xmath62 must be satisfied .    in the context of models of real ( rough ) interfaces of cry stals , eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) is known as the edwards - wilkinson process  @xcite .",
    "there is a large literature on more elaborate equations of this form ( usually with nonlinear terms ) @xcite .    to make plausible the assumption of uncorrelated noise",
    ", one must consider the action of the microscopic dynamics on the microscopic heights @xmath4 . an elementary dimer flip changes @xmath4 on just one plaquette by @xmath63 , and the next dimer flip occurs at another random place .",
    "thus the net height is not conserved , the change is local , and uncorrelated in time , which are modeled by the identical properties of the langevin noise in ( [ noise ] ) .",
    "we can fourier transform the above equations , since periodic boundary conditions maintain translational symmetry .",
    "my short - distance cutoff prescription for this continuum field theory shall be that the fields fourier transforms have support only in the brillouin zone @xmath64 ; in other words , the only allowed @xmath65 values are those which are defined for the microscopic lattice model ( see sec .  [ micro ] ) . then ( [ langevin ] ) becomes @xmath66 with gaussian noise @xmath67 ( note that @xmath68 is the discrete @xmath69-function , appropriate to the discrete lattice of wavevectors corresponding to periodic boundary conditions . )",
    "thus the different fourier components are decoupled in ( [ qlangevin ] ) . for each of them ( except for @xmath70 ) ,",
    "( [ qlangevin ] ) is a one - dimensional langevin equation with a restoring force .",
    "the correlation function of the heights is easy to derive from the langevin equation : it is @xmath71 where the relaxation rate is @xmath72    hohenberg and halperin argued@xcite , that the dynamic exponent is best defined by the relation between relaxation rates and wavevectors",
    ". then ( [ lambdah ] ) implies @xmath10 . as a corollary to ( [ lambdah ] )",

    "( a complication , unimportant for the present discussion , is that the height function @xmath4 or @xmath56 has two or more components in the quasicrystal cases . ) in one case of a quasicrystal random tiling ( in three spatial dimensions ) , ( [ lambdah ] ) was confirmed by simulation @xcite .",
    "after @xmath31 was constructed , the data were numerically fourier transformed to give @xmath75 at selected ( small ) wavevectors @xmath65 ; for @xmath65 small , that is essentially @xmath76 .",
    "then the time correlations @xmath77 were fitted to the form ( [ hdecay ] ) and a plot of @xmath78 versus @xmath65 revealed the behavior ( [ lambdah ] ) .",

    "the continuum equations below would still predict @xmath80 in that geometry , as was observed in the simulations.@xcite note , though , that they define @xmath6 without the benefit of fourier analysis , as the mean time it takes two ( initially independent ) replicas of the system to coincide , when evolved using identical random numbers sequences .",
    "[ fp - fourier ]    just as the discrete stochastic dynamics implies ( [ master ] ) , the continuum stochastic dynamics ( [ langevin ] ) implies the familiar fokker - planck equation for the evolution of the probability density @xmath81 : _ appears _ to be manipulated as if it were a real variable ; the convention @xmath82 justifies the manipulations in ( [ fokker ] )  ( [ psi ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath83 a physicist analyzing the edwards - wilkinson dynamics ( [ langevin ] ) would usually have stopped at ( [ hdecay ] ) . that does indeed represent the slowest fourier mode at each wavevector , but there are many more eigenmodes of the general equation ( [ fokker ] )",
    "these modes are worth computing because ( i ) they permit computation of more general correlation functions than ( [ hdecay ] ) ( ii ) the analytic form of the modes , derived below , might inspire improvements on the variational eigenfunctions used in sec .",

    "obviously this is mathematically identical to the quantum hamiltonian for a set of harmonic oscillators with frequencies @xmath78 given by ( [ lambdah ] ) , with a `` ground state wavefunction '' @xmath94 .",

    "when translated back in terms of @xmath81 , we see that each eigenstate is a product of @xmath97 , times polynomials in @xmath98 . for the `` elementary excitation '' , in which @xmath99 for one wavevector and zero for all the others ) , this polynomial is exactly @xmath100 ; this explains why the correlation function ( [ hdecay ] ) sees only that one eigenmode .",
    "the eigenvalue corresponding to ( [ psi ] ) is @xmath101 corresponding to the total energy of the quantum oscillators .",

    "besides the translations in real space , a height model ( as i define it ) has the additional symmetry of translations in `` height space '' ( the target space of @xmath4 and @xmath56 ) .",
    "correspondingly we will find another kind of slow mode ( in a finite system ) , corresponding to a random walk of the mean height . which i will call the `` height - shift mode '' .",

    "the langevin equation ( [ langevin ] ) with @xmath110 tells us @xmath111 simply executes a gaussian random walk .",
    "when @xmath56 describes a genuine interface , states with different @xmath112 are all distinct , and the distribution of @xmath112 simply spreads diffusively without ever reaching a steady state .",
    "however , in the dimer model ( and all other `` height models''@xcite ) the height map is one - to - many : here a global shift of @xmath113 describes exactly the same dimer configuration , so the image space of @xmath56 should be considered a circle of diameter 4 .",
    "thus the distribution function , which begins sharply peaked at a particular value of @xmath112 , will evolve to a uniform distribution at some rate .    to make this mode more concrete",
    ", it may help to compare with the behavior of a spin operator as seen in app .",
    "[ spincorr ] . a system with a height distribution peaked at ( say ) 1 and 3 has more dimers in one orientation than in the other .",
    "as this @xmath114 mode decays , this polarization of orientations will decay ; thus these modes have quite real physical meanings .",
    "the random walk behavior ( analog of ( [ hdecay ] ) ) is @xmath115 with a diffusion constant @xmath116 it is interesting that although the continuum theory can not provide the numerical value of the coefficient @xmath52 , it does predict an exact ratio ( in the limit @xmath117 ) between the relaxation rate of the modulation @xmath118 , and the diffusion rate of the wandering of @xmath119 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for @xmath112 is simply the diffusion equation ; its eigenfunctions are simply plane waves as a function of @xmath112 , @xmath120 and the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath121 with @xmath122 given by ( [ diffconst ] ) .",
    "if @xmath112 were diffusing on a line , then any @xmath123 would be valid in ( [ lambdahbar ] ) giving a continuum of eigenvalues .",
    "but , as noted above , a global shift @xmath124 of a microstate corresponds to the same microstate .",
    "thus , the only modes which can correspond to modes in the microscopic model are those periodic under @xmath125 ; i.e. @xmath126 for any integer @xmath127 .",
    "and the smallest such eigenvalue is @xmath128    thus the _ complete _ set of eigenfunctions are @xmath129 a product of ( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psihbar ] ) , with any integer @xmath127 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue is @xmath130 with the first term from ( [ lambdatot ] ) .",

    "would not be smallest in the case of @xmath56 fixed along the boundaries , as in @xcite and @xcite , since that forbids @xmath112-wandering modes .",
    "notice also that , for systems of unequal length sides , the ratio of ( [ lambdahmin ] ) to ( [ lambdahbarmin ] ) is decreased by a factor @xmath133 so that for a sufficiently elongated system the fourier mode is the slowest one . ]",
    "thus ( [ lambdahbarmin ] ) is smaller than ( [ lambdahmin ] ) by a factor @xmath134 . from appendix",
    "[ static ] , the exact value is @xmath135 so this ratio is @xmath136 .    is the height - shift mode qualitatively distinct from the capillary wave modes",
    "clearly there is a close connection  the uniform fluctuation of the entire sample of diameter @xmath7 is much like the fluctuation of one quadrant of a system of diameter @xmath137 with a long wavelength fourier mode .",
    "i would argue there _ is _ a distinction , in that the rate of the @xmath119 relaxation depend on `` internal '' details of the height model ; it can not be inferred given only the capillary spectrum .",
    "for example , i have noted the fully - frustrated ising model with single - spin - flip dynamics is identical to the dimer model _ except _ that it has a height space period of 8 rather than 4 .",
    "thus one must replace @xmath138 in ( [ qvalues ] ) and the smallest eigenvalue ( [ lambdahbarmin ] ) is smaller by a factor @xmath139 .",
    "( in the fully - frustrated ising model , a shift @xmath140 reverses all the spins ; thus the mode with @xmath141 is the slowest mode that is odd in spin . ) in the other direction , i can not rule out the possibility that in some height model , the stiffness constant @xmath53 and height periodicity @xmath54 might have numerical values such that @xmath142 , in which case the slowest mode would be the fourier mode .",
    "the relationship of the height - shift mode to the capillary wave modes ( both of which are a consequence of height - shift sysmmetry ) , is reminiscent of the relationship between two kinds of low energy excitation in a quantum spin system ( both consequences of spin rotational symmetry . )",
    "the height - shift mode is the analog of the change in total spin number ( giving energies @xmath143 ) ; the capillary mode is the analog of a spin - wave mode .",

    "now , @xmath97 corresponds to the eigenmode of the discrete model which has equal weight @xmath145 for every microstate .",
    "thus the prescription for constructing the approximate eigenmode of the discrete system is @xmath146 here @xmath147 is considered an implicit function of the discrete state label @xmath34 .",
    "we obtained ( [ discretemode ] ) simply by replacing @xmath148 , and @xmath149 defined by @xmath150 which one expects to be valid for small enough @xmath144 and @xmath65 .",
    "however , ( [ discretemode ] ) does not map every mode of the continuum equation to an approximate mode of the discrete one .",
    "indeed , since each @xmath144 is unbounded from above , the continuum kernel @xmath151 has infinitely many independent eigenmodes , whereas the discrete kernel @xmath15 has only @xmath43 eigenmodes . presumably , when @xmath144 is so large that @xmath152 is of order unity for some @xmath65 the anharmonic terms that i omitted in writing ( [ freee ] ) become important and mix this mode with others .",
    "thus only @xmath153 is a good `` quantum number '' for labeling the higher modes .",
    "the low - energy eigenstates of the quantum dimer model ( [ qdimer ] ) can be predicted from the above analysis .",
    "the wavefunctions should be approximated by ( [ psigrand ] ) and the energies given by ( [ lambdagrand ] ) .",
    "these predictions could be compared@xcite with the results of recent exact - diagonalization studies on @xmath154 lattices@xcite ) .",
    "now we return to the exact microscopic dynamics , as introduced in sec .",
    "i. the microstates are viewed as nodes of a graph in an abstract space , with each possible dimer - flip ( and its inverse ) forming an edge of the graph : the dynamics described by ( [ master ] ) is a random walk on this graph .",
    "as noted already , the graph of microstates with tilt zero has only one connected component .",
    "the matrix @xmath15 is not only stochastic but symmetric .",
    "the key idea in this section is the use of a variational guess for the eigenfunction .",

    "then the sum ( [ phidiff ] ) reduces to @xmath162 ( the @xmath163 cancels the double - counting of each graph edge ) , and finally to @xmath164 here @xmath165 is the probability that a given plaquette is `` flippable '' , i.e. @xmath166 is the average `` coordination number '' of the microstate graph .",

    "then @xmath178 performs a random walk , and @xmath179 , a pure exponential decay . in light of ( [ dyncorr ] ) , in which coefficients allowed by symmetry are expected to be generically positive , we would obtain @xmath180 .",
    "however , dynamics actually adopted ( in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) is such that the steps are manifestly anticorrelated in time . for",
    ", if a plaquette flips , it must undergo the reverse flip the next time it flips , unless its configuration has been shuffled in the meantime by flips of the adjoining plaquettes .",
    "so one would expect ( but did not prove ! )",
    "that @xmath181 as a strict inequality .",
    "first we review the use of basis states with definite @xmath65 vectors .",
    "consider the action of a translation of @xmath18 ; this induces a permutation of microstates which manifestly commutes with @xmath15 .",
    "thus all eigenvectors must have a definite wavevector @xmath65 ( or can be chosen thus ) ; that is , a translation by @xmath18 simply induces a multiplication by @xmath182 of the eigenvector .",
    "furthermore @xmath15 must have zero matrix elements between vectors with different @xmath65 ; thus @xmath15 becomes block - diagonal in the new basis of states with definite @xmath65 .",
    "hence ( [ varbound ] ) is valid for the smallest eigenvalue @xmath183 in each block of definite @xmath65 ; that is , if @xmath155 has wavevector @xmath65 , then @xmath184    a suitable variational state - space vector ( for @xmath185 ) is suggested by the `` elementary excitation '' eigenfunctions of subsec .",
    "[ fp - fourier ] ; they consisted of the steady - state eigenfunction @xmath186 multiplied by @xmath187 .",
    "the microscopic analog of the gaussian @xmath186 is the equal - weighted eigenfunction of @xmath15 , hence we choose @xmath188 ( here @xmath189 means take the configuration @xmath4 corresponding to microstate @xmath34 and fourier transform it for wavevector @xmath65 ) . if @xmath190 are related by one dimer flip on the plaquette at @xmath191 , the corresponding configurations of @xmath4 differ only by @xmath63 at @xmath191 .",
    "consequently @xmath192 .",
    "on the other hand , the denominator of ( [ varbound ] ) is exactly @xmath193 ( recall each microstate is weighted equally ) .",
    "thus the variational bound has the form @xmath194 finally , we know @xmath195 at small @xmath65 , as derived in appendix  [ static ] .",
    "( [ tzfluc ] ) .",
    "this gives the result ( for small @xmath65 ) @xmath196 if we assume ( [ lambdah ] ) , then ( [ varfinal ] ) gives a bound on the kinetic coefficient : @xmath197    this approach  constructing a variational vector from the fourier transform of a local operator ",
    "is equivalent to the `` single - mode approximation '' used for quantum many - body systems such as superfluid helium @xcite .",
    "indeed , already noted ( in the context of the quantum dimer model ) that an exact upper bound on the eigenvalue is implied .",
    "their proposed variational wavefunction is the fourier transform of an dimer density operator @xmath198 .",
    "in fact , this is actually just @xmath199 ( difference operator in the direction @xmath200 ) ; thus their choice differs from ( [ varphi ] ) only by a derivative .",
    "they did not identify the excitations as capillary waves , but derived the exponent @xmath10 using the correlations of .",
    "( see appendix  [ spincorr ] ) .",
    "that situation arises in the other height models , or in the dimer model when confugurations are weighted unequally . ]",
    "the variational trick also works for the random walk behavior of ( [ diffconst ] ) .",
    "obviously the microscopic analog of ( [ hbar ] ) is @xmath201 defined by ( [ zbar ] ) .",
    "then the @xmath70 modes can be further block - diagonalized into modes with particular wavevectors @xmath123 in height space , as defined in subsec .",
    "[ fp - rwalk ] , hence the variational bound is valid within each such block ( to be labeled `` @xmath202 '' ) .    in analogy to ( [ psihbar ] ) , we use the variational vector @xmath203 in this case , @xmath204 for any state @xmath34 , with @xmath205 the same as before , and obviously @xmath206 in any state .",
    "so from ( [ lambdaphi ] ) we obtain the bound @xmath207 , or @xmath208 for large @xmath0 .    just like the results ( [ lambdah ] ) and ( [ lambdahbar ] ) for the two respective kinds of mode in the continuum model , the best variational upper bounds for slow relaxation rates in the microscopic model correspond respectively to @xmath209 in ( [ varfinal ] ) or to @xmath210 in ( [ varzbar ] ) .",
    "either kind of bound implies a lower bound on the relaxation time @xmath211 which is @xmath212 .",
    "the better bound comes from ( 39 ) , and after substituting the value of @xmath165 ( [ fvalue ] ) gives @xmath213    it is interesting to note that ( [ varzbar ] ) , when compared to ( [ diffconst ] ) and ( [ lambdahbar ] ) , gives the same bound on @xmath52 as eq .",
    "( [ gammabound ] ) derived from fourier modes .",
    "this might be taken as an approximation for @xmath52 , which amounts ( as already noted ) to neglecting the anticorrelation of flips .",
    "such an approximation for @xmath52 was made in a random tiling quasicrystal model .",
    "( see sec .",
    "iv a and footnote 36 of ref .  ) .",
    "this turned out@xcite to overestimate the true @xmath52 ( estimated from the simulation ) by about 50% .",
    "the results in secs .  [ cont ] and [ micro ] exemplify the fruitfulness of fourier analysis in models with translational symmetry ; indeed two types of fourier transform were used . for capillary wave modes ( sec .",
    "[ cont ] , and subsec .",
    "[ micro - fourier ] ) , the fourier transform operates with respect to translations in physical space . for height - shift modes ( sec .",
    "[ rwalk ] and subsec .",
    "[ micro - rwalk ] ) , it operates on translations in `` height space '' . for each type of mode ,",
    "two arguments have been given , one based on a coarse - grained field theory ( secs .",
    "[ cont ] and  [ rwalk ] ) and the other based on exact bounds ( sec .  [ micro ] ) , which indicate the the longest relaxation time scales with system size as @xmath214 .",
    "the only rigorous consequence of the present argument is a _ lower _ bound ( [ vartau ] ) on the longest relaxation time . for computational purposes",
    "one prefers , of course , an _ upper _ bound on the time needed to equilibrate the system . towards this end ,",
    "the present calculation merely suggests the possible usefulness of fourier analysis in such a demonstration , and warns that the slowest mode is not a fourier modulation at all but the `` @xmath215 diffusion '' ( see subsec .  [ fp - rwalk ] ) .",
    "this study is relevant to the dynamics of other spin models .",
    "in particular , its results apply directly to the critical dynamics of the fully - frustrated ising model on the square lattice since that model ( at its critical temperature , @xmath216 ) maps to the dimer covering @xcite .",
    "the single - spin - flip dynamics in the spin model maps to the dimer - flip dynamics used here .    the derivations could be trivially adapted to the dimer covering of the honeycomb lattice and hence to the critical ( @xmath216 ) dynamics of the triangular ising antiferromagnet ( equivalent to the dimer covering @xcite ) .",
    "the behavior argued here can be expected in other spin models which have height representation and single - spin update rules , e.g. the @xmath79 three - state potts antiferromagnet on the square lattice ( equivalent to the 6-vertex model @xcite and hence the bcsos model ) . in those cases , however , no exact results or rigorous bounds for the static fluctuations are available to replace appendix  [ static ] .",
    "understanding the local dynamics addressed here is also a prerequisite to addressing the dynamics of height models endowed with loop - update or cluster - update rules , including fully - frustrated ising models@xcite , the three - state potts antiferromagnet on the square lattice @xcite , the bcsos model@xcite , and coloring models@xcite .",
    "it turns out that all the algorithms cited have a simple action on the height variables , thus the existence of a height map may be a prerequisite to the possibility of accelerating such models .",
    "more speculatively , it would be interesting to check whether there is any connection between the swendsen - wang @xcite algorithm and the height representation in the case of the ferromagnetic 4-state potts model , the partition function of which can be mapped to that of a height model@xcite .",
    "incidentally , the static correlation exponents of height models have been obtained from monte carlo simulations much more accurately via fourier analysis of the heights , than via direct measurement .",
    "it seems likely that the same is true for dynamic measurements ; this might help in evaluating the dynamic exponent for cluster - acceleration algorithms ( see ref .  )",
    "somewhat analogous to the loop - update rules are the `` zipper moves''@xcite of certain random tiling quasicrystal models , such as the ( two - dimensional ) square - triangle random tiling . in that case",
    ", the correlation time was measured to be of @xmath217 update move per site@xcite ; however each update move involved @xmath212 sites ,",
    "so the scaling of the net correlation time was @xmath218 just as for the local dimer flip dynamics treated in the present paper .",
    "the height field is the hidden order parameter in the present model ( or of height models in general ) and hence is the proper way to approach the coarse - grained , long time dynamics .",
    "note that experience has shown that the _ static _",
    "exponents are extracted much more efficiently from @xmath219 than from spin - spin correlations ( using the same simulations )  @xcite .",
    "therefore , i suggest numerical studies of the dynamics ought to extract estimates of the correlation times directly from the height fields rather than from spin - spin correlations .",
