    "chief amongst the remarkable effects observed in superconductors is their eponymous perfect conductivity . within bcs theory @xcite , where superconductivity arises due to pairing between electrons , the effects of temperature @xmath1 , magnetic field @xmath2 , and disorder",
    "are well understood : as the pairing amplitude is suppressed by these physical parameters , the system becomes normal , and attains a finite resistance . for low - dimensional systems , on the other hand , it has been long understood that phase fluctuations of the pairing amplitude play a major role in the loss of perfect conductance  @xcite . in two - dimensional systems , for example",
    ", it has been demonstrated  @xcite that as the temperature increases there is a critical temperature @xmath3 where vortices and anti - vortices unbind and proliferate through the system , leading to the loss of global phase coherence and superconductivity , even though the pairing amplitude remain finite .",
    "indications of such a berezinsky - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition have been observed in josephson - junction arrays  @xcite , in superconducting ( sc ) thin films  @xcite , and possibly in high-@xmath4 cuprates  @xcite .    in recent years",
    "there has been a reinvigoration of research into low - dimensional superconductors .",
    "this has been motivated by intriguing experimental observations of electronic transport through disordered sc thin films , such as a huge magnetoresistance peak  @xcite and a `` super - insulator '' phase  @xcite , and by the technological progress in producing two - dimensional superconductors in the interface between two oxides  @xcite and in making ultra - thin cuprate superconductors  @xcite .",
    "many of these observations are not yet satisfactory explained , chiefly because there is no theory that can calculate the current , even numerically , through a disordered superconductor , based on a microscopic model .",
    "the calculation of the resistance within the bcs picture , usually based on the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) mean - field approach , is straightforward .",
    "blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk ( btk )  @xcite studied the reflectance and transmission at a metal - superconductor junction , and an analogous study was performed at superconductor - metal - superconductor junctions  @xcite .",
    "similar approaches  @xcite utilized the buttiker - landauer picture  @xcite for non - interacting cooper pairs to study scattering through a sc region .",
    "( a difficulty with the direct application of the bdg formalism is the non - conservation of charge , which can be overcome by studying a normal ring containing a sc segment  @xcite . )",
    "an alternative approach near to the bcs critical temperature is to use a scaling assumption for the conductivity  @xcite .",
    "the current through diffusive normal metal - superconductor structures has also been calculated using a keldysh scattering matrix theory  @xcite .",
    "all these approaches neglect phase fluctuations so can not be used to study two - dimensional superconductors that exhibit a bkt - like transition at low temperatures .",
    "the resistance of low - dimensional superconductors can also be calculated using phenomenological models .",
    "the conductivity of uniform systems can be probed analytically by studying phase slips across the sample within the ginzburg - landau approach  @xcite .",
    "thermally excited phase slips explain both non - linear conductivity and vortex creep induced resistance  @xcite , whilst quantum activated phase slips can drive sc wires insulating  @xcite .",
    "however , phenomenological calculations are neither underpinned by a microscopic model nor include coulomb repulsion or disorder except for the introduction of a phenomenological normal state resistance .    here",
    "we develop a new formalism to calculate the current through a superconductor taking into account phase fluctuations in the presence of disorder , finite @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and coulomb repulsion .",
    "the approach we detail here is based on the landauer - buttiker scheme @xcite , where one attaches metallic leads to the sample , and then calculate its conductance .",
    "the lead - superconductor tunneling barriers ensure that the conductance of the system is always finite , even in the sc phase . a previous attempt using the quantum monte carlo approach to calculate current in disordered systems employed the fluctuation - dissipation theorem via the current - current correlation function  @xcite .",
    "the landauer formula  @xcite is a widely adopted method to calculate the current through a mesoscopic sample that contains non - interacting particles .",
    "meir and wingreen @xcite have generalized the formula to produce an exact expression for the current through any interacting region attached to non - interacting leads , which has been successfully applied to a wide range of systems . following this approach , we partition the system into the three parts shown in fig .

    "the left and right - hand metallic leads are shown in blue , from which electrons can tunnel through the barriers shown by the gray links into the central sc region which is shown in red . ]",

    "a significant advantage of the formalism is that it allows us to construct current and potential maps of the system .",
    "these allow us to diagnose the microscopic features that increase the resistance of the sample .",

    "the potential drops mainly in the contacts , and in the sample is equal to the average of the two leads with small random fluctuations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sci](d ) at @xmath207 the sc order parameter practically vanishes , there is no supercurrent , and , due to the increasing resistance , only a small normal current flows through the sample .",

    "[ fig : sci](c ) highlights the interplay of the normal and sc current .",
    "there is a rough correlation between regions of finite sc order parameter and supercurrent flow , on one hand , and zero sc order parameter and normal current , on the other .",
    "we point out three typical regions of the sample .",
    "firstly , at ( 1 ) the order parameter is small and only normal current flows , whereas at ( 2 ) the order parameter is large and supercurrent flows .",
    "however , at ( 3 ) two sc regions are separated by a small normal region but are josephson coupled and so a supercurrent flows through the zero sc order region . by examining the potential lines we see that the normal regions , for example ( 1 ) , are acting as weak links whereas the potential drop over the superconducting regions is small .",
    "thus the overall resistance of the sample is dominated by such weak links .",
    "the current and potential maps allow us to see the superconductor - insulator transition developing , and we plan to investigate in details the relation of such a percolative picture to the kosterlitz - thouless transition , as was recently suggested @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have developed a new exact formula to calculate the current through a superconductor connected to two non - interacting metallic leads with an imposed potential difference .",
    "the formula was implemented with a negative-@xmath0 hubbard model which included both phase and amplitude fluctuations in the sc order parameter .",
    "a new chebyshev expansion method allowed us to solve the model and calculate the current in @xmath85 time , granting access to systems of unprecedented size .",
    "the formalism also enables the generation of current and potential maps which show exactly where the super current and separately the normal current flows through the system .",
    "the formalism was exhaustively tested against a series of well - established results , demonstrating the accuracy of the procedure , its ability to capture various physical processes relevant to superconductivity in disordered systems , and correctly model the presence of a magnetic field and finite temperature .",
    "these tests indicate that the formalism and accompanying numerical solver can robustly calculate the current through a superconductor across a wide range of systems . in the future we plan to report on the application of the formalism to several outstanding questions , such as the magneto - resistance anomaly on crossing the superconductor - insulator transition  @xcite , the little parks effect in nano - scale cylinders  @xcite , and dissipation - driven phase transitions in sc wires  @xcite .    _",

    "in particular , by varying the system size we observe that the method of calculating all the eigenvalues is more efficient for systems smaller than @xmath289 , but the new chebyshev approach is superior for large systems .",
    "we took advantage of this development to study systems of unprecedented size .",
    "the chebyshev expansion method just described represents a zero order approximation .",
    "however , we can extend this method further and calculate the lowest order change in the chebyshev expansion following a shift in the configuration of the fields @xmath78 and @xmath77 by @xmath290 . the resultant shift in the chebyshev expansion of @xmath291",
    "is found using the recursion relationships @xmath292 with @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "this allows the chebyshev expansion coefficients to be extrapolated over several configuration space sweeps , and the calculation time falls proportionally .",
    "averaging also reduces the influence of changes in the surrounding order parameters . in practice",
    "it was found that up to ten extrapolation steps could be performed , resulting in a code speed - up of a factor of ten .    though the chebyshev approach can be used to direct the sampling of the system , to calculate expectation values , such as the current , it is necessary to diagonalize the system and determine the field configurations of its states .",
    "formally this requires @xmath256 time .",
    "however , since the current is dominated by the quasiparticle states near to the fermi surface we instead adopt the implicitly restarted arnoldi method  @xcite to calculate only those particular states .",
    "we are also helped by the sparsity of the matrix , which allows us to calculate @xmath211 eigenstates in @xmath295 time .",
    "it is usually necessary to calculate a certain fraction of the energy states , so @xmath296 , and the total cost is @xmath243 . the eigenfunctions and energies can then be used to calculate the current for a specific realization of @xmath78 and @xmath77 using the formalism described in sec .",
    "[ sec : analyticalformalism ] .",
    "it is then necessary to average over successive realizations of @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "however , the contribution from successive monte carlo calculations might be serially correlated which would result in an underestimated value for the uncertainty in the predicted value of the current . to correct for this we calculated the correlation time through the truncated autocorrelation function  @xcite",
    "we find a typical correlation time of approximately six monte carlo steps , which without autocorrelation corrections would correspond to an underestimate in the uncertainty of a factor of @xmath297 .",
