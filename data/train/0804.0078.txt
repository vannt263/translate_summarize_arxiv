    "the methodology that we employ in this paper is quite straightforward .",
    "first , we identify sources with known spectroscopic redshifts in the goods - s field .",
    "we then shortlist those galaxies with redshift in the range @xmath1 and rest frame absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath23 to obtain a volume limited sample of primary galaxies .",
    "we then identify neighbours within a projected radius of @xmath24   around each primary galaxy .",
    "if the difference in the apparent magnitude @xmath25 of the primary galaxy and the neighbour satisfy the condition @xmath26 in either the @xmath27 or the @xmath0 filter , the galaxy pair is designated to be a _ major pair _ in that particular filter .",
    "this is explained in section  [ pairs ] .",
    "we do not have the redshift for the secondary member of a major pair in most cases , and as such some of them can simply be foreground / background superpositions .",
    "such a contamination is statistically corrected for by using number counts of objects in the field in the z or @xmath0 filter and is explained in detail in section  [ contamination ] .",
    "our primary galaxy sample is then binned into three redshift bins .",
    "the fraction of galaxies undergoing major merger in any given redshift bin is then inferred from the fraction of galaxies existing in major pairs in the same bin , after applying a correction for foreground / background contamination .",
    "the evolution in the major merger fraction is then determined by looking for any change in the major merger fraction over the three redshift bins that we have .",
    "we cross - correlated the hst / acs source catalog with the three redshift catalogs mentioned above to yield objects with spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath1 .",
    "since we have used spectroscopic redshifts from various surveys in the cdfs for the sample selection , our sample is liable to suffer from the same biases as those induced at the time of target selection by the spectroscopic surveys .",
    "the images survey is biased towards brighter galaxies with strong emission lines ( ravikumar et al .",
    "the shorter integration times used in the images survey results in poor snr for fainter galaxies and results in difficulties in estimating redshifts for galaxies which exhibit only absorption lines or weak emission lines .",
    "hence they are biased against faint , red early type galaxies .",
    "however , this bias is recovered to a large extent by the sample selection criterion of the goods / fors2 redshift survey(vanzella et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is tailor - made to exploit the red throughput and sensitivity of fors2 .",
    "this preferentially selects red , faint early types galaxies , and provides a nice complimentary redshift catalog to the images survey .",
    "indeed this has been discussed at length by ravikumar et al .",
    "@xcite ( see their section 4.1 ) who have tested successfully the representativeness of the combination of images and fors2 sample .",
    "the vvds survey , on the other hand , is quite unbiased owing to the simple selection criterion of apparent magnitude @xmath28 and does not bias for or against any particular type of object ( le fevre et al .",
    "the recovery success rate for the three redshifts surveys vary from 88% for the vvds , 77% for goods / fors2 and 76% for the images survey .",
    "in addition to this , the above mentioned recovery rates are a function of magnitude of the object ( see le fevre et al .",
    "2004 , vanzella et al .",
    "2005 & ravikumar et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore , as in any flux limited survey , fainter objects with weaker or no emission lines ( eg .",
    "red absorption line galaxies ) are underrepresented .",
    "this caveat must be kept in mind while interpreting the results presented in this paper .",
    "inspite of the limitations imposed by the flux - limited nature of the surveys , a combination of these three redshift catalogs yields a sample of galaxies which is reasonably representative of the field galaxy population out to a redshift of @xmath41.2 .",
    "galaxies with rest frame absolute magnitude brighter than @xmath23 have been selected as the primary galaxies , leaving us with 695 galaxies .",
    "the luminosity cut off was selected to ensure that the sample does not suffer from any incompleteness ( malmquist bias ) in the highest redshift bin .",
    "rest - frame j band is significantly less affected by sporadic star formation than bluer bands , and is more representative of the stellar mass content .",

    "deblending is a major source of worry when studying close pairs of objects .",
    "however , we are essentially immune to this problem as our selection criteria demands that the fainter member of a pair have at least 25% of the flux of the other member to qualify as a major pair .",
    "hence even if sextractor ends up splitting a source into two ( or more ) owing to a low value of deblend_mincont , it will still not get counted as a legitimate major pair .",
    "the combination of detect_thresh , detect_minarea and deblend_mincont has been optimised after several iterations of experimenting with different values for these parameters and subsequent visual examination after overlaying the derived catalog onto the j & ks band images .",

    "this condition ensures that the fainter member of the pair has at least 25% of the @xmath27 or @xmath0 band flux of the brighter member .",
    "it is important to note here that it is entirely possible for a neighbour to be _",

    "it may indeed happen that a fainter galaxy within a pair has a spectroscopic measurement , while the brighter galaxy has none , owing to observing constraints of the redshift survey .",
    "not including brighter neighbours can lead to an underestimation of the derived merger fraction .",
    "we find that not including major pairs in which the neighbour is brighter than the primary galaxy , we will underestimate the number of major pairs by 34% in the ks filter and 24% in the z filter .",
    "the importance of including brighter companions in the definition of major pairs has been missed by earlier workers in the field .",
    "the simple selection criterion employed by us yielded a sample of 162 and 226 tentative major pair candidates in the @xmath0 filter , and in the @xmath27 filter , respectively .",
    "we do not have the redshift for the secondary member of a pair in most cases , therefore some of them can simply be foreground / background superpositions .",
    "such a contamination can be statistically corrected for by using number counts of objects in the field and is explained in section  [ contamination ] . however , in the cases where the secondary member does have a redshift , we have used it to rule out those apparent pairs from the list which are obviously at different redshift as compared to the host galaxy .",
    "this left us with 125 and 181 major pair candidates in the @xmath0 filter , and in the @xmath27 filter , respectively .",
    "furthermore , a lower limit of @xmath38   is imposed on the separation between the major pair candidates and the main galaxy in order to avoid confusing clumpy extensions of the main galaxy itself as a neighbour .",
    "this left us with 119 and 170 major pair candidates in the @xmath0 filter , and in the @xmath27 filter , respectively .",

    "we have used the @xmath27 as well as the @xmath0 filter to define major mergers because the former filter allows to find companions very near to the primary galaxy ( thanks to the exquisite spatial resolution of the acs camera ) and the latter is less affected by star formation and more representative of the stellar mass ( e.g. bundy et al .",
    "2004 ) .      since we do not have redshift for the secondary member of a pair in most cases , some of them can simply be foreground / background superpositions .",
    "such a contamination can be statistically corrected for by using number counts of objects in the field in the z or @xmath0 filter to estimate the probability of finding an object within projected @xmath24   of the main galaxy and within @xmath39 magnitude of the main galaxy .",

    "it may be noted that this statistical correction is only calculated ( and subtracted ) in those cases where the neighbor does not have a spectroscopic redshift . if the neighbor has a spectroscopic redshift , we know for sure if it is a real pair or not , hence no need to apply the statistical correction .",

    "the final number is listed in table  [ table1 ] , segregated into three redshift bins , summed over all the host galaxies ( with neighbours sans redshift ) in a given redshift bin .",
    "we tested the accuracy of our statistically estimated foreground / background contamination derived in section  [ contamination ] in two ways .",
    "first , we compute the ratio of the statistically expected neighbours to the number of major neighbours actually found in projection as listed in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "this can be termed as a sort of _ contamination rate_. this contamination rate is then compared to earlier works of le fevre et al .",
    "the contamination rate that we find here ( in the z band ) is @xmath45 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the contamination rate of @xmath46 ( as derived from table 3 of le fevre et al .",
    "this agreement gives us additional confidence in our estimate of the foreground / background contamination .",
    "in addition to comparison with earlier works , we also checked our contamination rate of @xmath45 with the contamination rate derived using the subset of our major pairs where we have spectroscopic redshifts for both members of the pair .",
    "there are 65 major pairs in the z band where both members of the pair have spectroscopic redshifts . in order to establish how many of these 65 major pairs are indeed at the _ same _ redshift",
    ", we plotted a histogram of @xmath47 for these 65 major pairs .",
    "this is shown in fig .  [ deltaz ] .",
    "it turns out that there are a number of pairs with @xmath48 , which are presumably located at the _ same _ redshift , with the residual difference in redshift @xmath49 being attributed to redshift measurement errors and peculier velocities of the members .",
    "a @xmath49 = 0.006 corresponds to delta velocity of 1800km / sec .",
    "we were forced to use this seemingly large value of @xmath49 due to the errorbars on the spectroscopic redshifts of the objects .",
    "the quoted errorbars in the redshift measurements are of the order @xmath40.002 for vvds and goods / fors2 and @xmath40.006 for the images survey .",
    "in addition to this , these quoted errorbars are to be treated as lower limits due to the way in which they are calculated ( see eg .",
    "vanzella et al .",
    "since we are using three different redshift surveys , we have taken to using the worst errorbars i.e. @xmath49 = 0.006 .",
    "this implies that the delta velocity of 1800 km / sec is to be treated as an upper limit , and the true delta velocity is liable to be smaller . in fig .",
    "[ deltaz ] many objects have @xmath49 much larger than 0.006 ( so much so that most of them are out of the frame in fig .",
    "[ deltaz ] ) .",
    "the members of such pairs are treated as having _ discordant redshifts _ and are essentially foreground / background superpositions . from this plot",
    ", we can then derive the fraction of pairs that are actually foreground / background superpositions ( i.e. the _ contamination rate _ ) .",
    "this _ contamination rate _ is found to be @xmath50 . on first sight",
    "this might appear larger than the _ contamination rate _ of @xmath45 that we have obtained using our statistically estimated foreground / background contamination ( although notice the large errorbars since we are dealing with small number statistics here ) .",
    "however , we checked the spectra of the pairs having discordant redshifts ourselves .",
    "it turns out that in many cases , the redshift determination can be quite poor indeed , specially in the low exposure and low resolution vvds ( as parametrised by their redshift flag ) .",
    "so in cases where the neighbor has a vvds redshift flag 2 ( 75% confidence ) or worse , there is a much greater risk of the pair being designated as having discordant redshifts .",
    "in addition to this , one also has to allow for the fact that some of the pairs using redshifts from the other two redshift catalogs can also be erroneously counted as discordant ( for the same reason as above ) .",
    "such pairs account for @xmath415/45 discordant redshift pairs in the z band .",
    "this can significantly swing the number of pairs with discordant redshifts . if we discard these 15 discordant cases and recalculate the contamination rate , we get @xmath51 as the contamination rate , which is in much better agreement with the _ contamination rate _ of @xmath45 that we have obtained using our statistically estimated foreground / background contamination . in the nutshell ,",
    "our contamination calculation is robust and the contamination rate compares well with the contamination rate reported in literature , as well as with the subsample of our major pairs where we have spectroscopic redshifts for both members of the pair . also , as a result of our eagerness to throw out prospective pairs as having discordant redshifts due to spurious redshift determination in some cases",
    ", we are going to end up with an estimate of merger fraction which is a bit too low and thus it should be treated as a lower limit .",
    "a major bias when studying close pairs of objects may be caused by the fact that sources are blended when their separation is comparable to the psf .",
    "it particularly affects ground based @xmath0 images because the @xmath0 psf ( @xmath40.5 ) is much larger than the hst optical psf ( @xmath40.1 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ theta ] , where we have plotted the angular separation between the main galaxy and neighbours identified in the @xmath27 filter against the @xmath27 magnitude of the neighbour , segregated into three redshift bins .",
    "a neighbour here is identified as any galaxy within @xmath24   of the primary galaxy , regardless of it s magnitude .",
    "the resultant list of 1085 neighbours includes major as well as minor neighbours , and constitutes the pool from which the major pairs are identified . in fig .",
    "[ theta ] , the open circles denote neighbours which have @xmath0 magnitudes , whereas the green crosses denote neighbours which do not have @xmath0 magnitude . as is evidenced in fig .",
    "[ theta ] , there are a large number ( @xmath443% ) of such neighbours which do not have ks band magnitudes .",
    "this has the consequence of reducing the pool of neighbours from which the major pairs are identified in the ks filter leading to an underestimation of the major pair fraction in the ks filter .",
    "most of the neighbours which do not have measurable @xmath0 magnitude are rather faint , with the green crosses clustering towards the faint end .",
    "although the @xmath44 inner cutoff guards against blending in the ks filter at lower redshifts , in the highest redshift bin , the angular size corresponding to @xmath44 is small enough to allow legitimate neighbours to be identified in the @xmath27 band within @xmath52 of the host galaxy , where blending in the @xmath0 filter can be a serious concern . on further investigation ,",
    "the bias is indeed found to be more severe in case of close neighbours , with @xmath454% of the neighbours within 1   of the main galaxy not having measured @xmath0 magnitude .",
    "furthermore , even out of the neighbours within 1   of the main galaxy which have a @xmath0 magnitude ascribed to them , @xmath417% are actually blended with the host galaxy .",
    "incompleteness of the @xmath0 band catalog due to detection limit and blending is therefore the main reason for missing out @xmath0 magnitudes for many of the neighbours .",
    "this implies that the major merger fraction that we derive using the @xmath0 filter is a _",
    "lower limit_. in addition , this effect is more severe at higher redshifts , leading to an underestimation of the _ rate _ at which the merger fraction evolves with redshift .",
    "in the @xmath27 band on the other hand , we have verified using the @xmath27 band number counts in the goods - s field , that the photometric catalog is complete down to the faintest magnitude expected of a neighbour for the faintest primary galaxy ( @xmath53 ) , even at the highest redshift ( @xmath41.2 ) .",

    "@xcite , the selection of pairs in the visible bands may be affected by star formation , i.e. some low mass companions may be brightened in visible , leading to an overestimate of the actual fraction of major pairs . in order to check this assertion , we compare the @xmath54 color of the primary galaxy to that of the neighbours which were identified in section  [ pairs ] .",

    "this yielded a merger rate of @xmath72 at the current epoch , which evolves by a factor @xmath73 to @xmath74 at @xmath75 using @xmath0 data . for the @xmath27 band data , these numbers are @xmath76 at the current epoch , which evolves by a factor @xmath77 to @xmath78 at @xmath75 . integrating over the timescale from @xmath75 to the current epoch",

    "for example if it were assumed to be 0.35(carlberg et al .",
    "2000 ) , it would lead to 59% as being the fraction of galaxies having experienced a major merger in the last @xmath11 .      as is well reported in literature ( le fevre et al .",
    "2004 , ravikumar et al .",
    "2007 ) , there are several large scale structures in the cdfs which show up as spikes in the redshift distribution obtained from various redshift surveys .",
    "the most prominent large scale structure is at a redshift of 0.735 .",
    "it represents a factor @xmath410 overdensity in terms of galaxy number density .",
    "this has the potential of significantly altering the results that we have obtained for merger fraction in the redshift bin @xmath80 .",
    "the detailed effect of such large scale structures on the cosmological relevance of the goods south field have been considered by ravikumar et al .",
    "@xcite . in order to check the robustness of our derived merger fraction",
    ", we recalculated the merger fraction in the redshift bin @xmath80 by excluding the sources embedded in the large scale structure at z=0.735 ( defined as objects within @xmath81 of z=0.735 ) .",
    "this resulted in the exclusion of 70 sources from the bin @xmath80 out of which 11 were major pairs ( in the ks band ) .",
    "the merger fraction dropped from 5.48% to 5.34% which is well within the reported errorbars .",
    "the derived merger rate is therefore not affected by the presence of the large scale structure .",
    "we have derived the major merger rates of galaxies in the redshift range @xmath1 using pair counting in both optical and near - ir bands .",
    "this work provides a robust estimate of the major merger rate upto redshift @xmath41.2 using a representative sample of near - ir selected galaxies , which are well within the photometric completeness of the source catalogs .",
    "we find steep evolution with redshift , with the merger fraction @xmath2 for optically selected pairs , and @xmath3 for pairs selected in the near - ir .",
    "the difference in the slopes obtained from the two filters @xmath27 and @xmath0 can be traced back to the photometric incompleteness and blending issues in the @xmath0 filter .",
    "we find that the major merger rate evolves by a factor @xmath73 from @xmath72 at the current epoch to @xmath74 at @xmath75 .",
    "this implies that between 41% and 59% of all galaxies with @xmath10 have undergone a major merger in the last @xmath11 , assuming that the average timescale for a pair to merge is in the range 0.5 to 0.35 .",
    "our result is in agreement with the recently published results by the cosmos team ( kartaltepe et al .",
    "2007 ) who report a power law index of @xmath82 , as well as other works such as le fevre et al .",
    "@xcite , carlberg et al .",
    "@xcite , patton et al .",
    "@xcite ( see table 2 in kartaltepe et al .",
    "reports of a significantly lower merger rate ( lin et al .",
    "2004 , carlberg et al .",
    "2000 ) , might be due to the fact that the investigators have used a luminosity evolution model for sample selection .",
    "indeed such a correction is not significant in our work since we have selected our sample in the rest frame near - ir .",
    "the disagreement in our @xmath0 derived merger fraction evolution with that reported by bundy et al .",
    "@xcite might be due to their relatively small statistics ( our sample size is @xmath83 times larger than theirs ) , and that they did not account for neighbours that are _ brighter _ than the primary galaxy .",
    "our study implies that the star formation enhancement of the companion does not affect severely the calculation of the merger rate .",
    "we notice that at least some of the discrepancies between results derived in this paper and those of other workers in the field can be attributed to different definitions of major mergers .",
    "the methodology of lotz et al .",
    "@xcite probes a merger at a different stage in the merging process ( ongoing merger ) , whereas our definition of major merger is sensitive to pairs of galaxies in an early stage of merger ( upcoming mergers ) so that two distinct members are easily distinguishable .",
    "studies with 3d spectroscopy are certainly better suited to identify on - going or post - merger stages .",
    "such studies ( flores et al .",
    "2006 , yang et al .",
    "2007 ) have found a frequent presence of complex kinematics at z=0.6 ( 26% of @xmath84@xmath65 - 20.3 galaxies ) , which if related to mergers , is 4 to 5 times higher than paired / on going mergers found in studies like this one ( see also lotz et al .",
    "indeed hammer et al .",
    "@xcite noticed that all studies of merger rate agree to find 5%@xmath85@xmath86 for the merger fraction at z=0.6 .",
    "if complex kinematics are related to mergers , it may imply a long duration ( 1 - 2 gyr ) for the remnant phase during which gaseous velocity fields are severely perturbed or chaotic ( using a simple ergodic argument ) . in the near future",
    "we will combine 3d spectroscopy of paired galaxies to identify the different time - scales of the merging process which might shape the galaxies as we observe them today .",
    "finally we notice that although toomre type ( toomre & toomre 1972 ) tidal features are seen in close pairs of galaxies in the lower redshift bins , such features are conspicuously absent in candidate pairs at higher redshifts .",
    "this is likely due to the @xmath87 surface brightness dimming , which quickly pushes the low surface brightness tidal features below the detection limits at higher redshifts .",
