    "causal triangulation ( ct ) , introduced by ambjrn and loll ( see @xcite ) , together with its predecessor a dynamical triangulation ( dt ) , constitute attemps to provide a meaning to the formal expressions appearing in the path integral quantisation of gravity ( see @xcite , @xcite for an overview ) .",
