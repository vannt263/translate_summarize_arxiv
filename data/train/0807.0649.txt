    "<S> the primary beam was shut off , and events from the germanium detector were recorded for 300  s before repeating the beam / count cycle . </S>",
    "<S> approximately 190 bombardment cycles were performed over a 32 hour run . with the cyclotron beam off , </S>",

    "<S> the peaks at 433 , 381 , 241 , 208 , and 43  kev are cascaded from a 67  @xmath29s ( @xmath36 ) state populated in the production reaction @xcite , and confirm that @xmath0pm was indeed produced and well - distinguished from other isobars . </S>",
    "<S> these peaks disappear in the  beam off \" spectrum , confirming that the cyclotron beam was turned off , and confirming that the production time of the @xmath0pm was short compared to a 5 to 10 second oscillation period .    </S>",
    "<S> the events were sorted into time - binned energy spectra for every 0.5  s. to measure the electron capture decays of @xmath0pm , we measured the rate of detected k - shell x - rays ( k@xmath33 , k@xmath34 ) . </S>",
    "<S> electron capture decay strongly favors k - shell x - ray emission compared to positron decay . </S>",
    "<S> the electron capture branching ratio for neutral @xmath0pm is 22% , of which about 85% is k - shell capture @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray fluorescence yield for a k - shell vacancy ( k@xmath3 plus k@xmath35 ) for nd is 91% @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> positron emission by @xmath0pm can in principle produce k - shell vacancy and hence k - shell x - rays via shakeoff and direct collision . </S>",
    "<S> however , these processes strongly favor outer shell vacancy production , particularly in high z atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the k - shell vacancy probability after @xmath37 decay should be very small  about @xmath38 for @xmath0pm @xcite . a very conservative upper limit on the amount of k - shell x - rays arising from @xmath37 emission would be 1.5% , assuming that all the auger k electron yield from @xmath0pm decay @xcite was attributable to @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> a detected k - shell x - ray therefore has a greater than 92% probability to have been created by electron capture decay , and a less than 8% probability to have come from positron emission . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq : oscdec ] compared to a simple exponential , we performed identical fits of monte - carlo generated data which had similar statistical power . </S>",
    "<S> the monte - carlo generated data contained only exponential decay with the same time - bin structure as the experimental data , with no oscillating terms . </S>",
    "<S> repeated trials of the fit procedure to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : oscdec ] on several hundred randomized exponential decay data sets found an average oscillation amplitude @xmath50 by 2.5 standard deviations . </S>",

    "<S> , we find a confidence level of 29.5% for the `` null hypothesis '' that the oscillating terms are real . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the hypothesis that there _ is _ an oscillating term in the real @xmath0pm decay data would only be justified at a 29.5% confidence level , compared to the 5% confidence level generated by the fits to simulated , non - oscillatory data , and compared to the 0.6% confidence claimed in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the conclusion that the fits to our data from @xmath0pm do not include statistically significant oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the fisher f - test confidence levels are misleading in this instance .    </S>",
    "<S> fourier transforms of the residuals to a simple exponential fit to the data are shown in fig .   </S>",

    "<S> figure [ fig : pmcompare ] shows the first 40  seconds of our decay data , roughly the time period considered in @xcite for @xmath0pm , along with a calculated decay curve with @xmath52 , @xmath53  s , and @xmath54  rad found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters are inconsistent with the data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that any oscillation of 5 ( or 7 ) seconds , if present , must have an amplitude smaller than that found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( @xmath55 ) by about a factor of 31 , using the uncertainty in the oscillation amplitude fit parameter as our sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> our beam bombardment time of 0.5 s would reduce our sensitivity to an oscillation amplitude , but a simple calculation ( integrating oscillating exponential decay and production ) suggests that this would reduce our sensitivity by 2% ( i.e. if @xmath52 , this experiment would have measured @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our best - fit oscillation amplitude is not statistically significant , and in any case has an amplitude a factor of 16 smaller than that proposed in @xcite , with a much different period and phase .    as a cross - check on our data , we measured the decay of 511  kev positron annihilation activity . reference @xcite suggests that the decay rate for electron capture events will oscillate while the @xmath37 decay rate might not , since the three - body phase space density for positron emission has a large neutrino momentum distribution , which would average out any coherence between final neutrino mass states </S>",
    "<S> . reference @xcite concludes that the positron decay of hydrogen - like ions will oscillate on a time scale too fast to have been observed in our data . </S>",
    "<S> the 511  kev decay data was fit to a simple exponential decay , finding a half - life of @xmath57  s with @xmath58/596 . fitting this data to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : oscdec ] we find a minimum @xmath59 for @xmath60 , @xmath61 and period @xmath62  s. the confidence level for this fit compared to simple exponential decay is 2.8% , suggesting that the oscillatory fit parameters improve the fit , more so than in the electron capture data set analyzed here , and slightly more so than in our monte - carlo simulated data which containted no oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> this is contrary to the expectation under the neutrino mixing hypothesis that there should be no oscillation in the positron decay activity . </S>",
    "<S> this result supports the conclusion that our oscillation fit parameters in the electron capture decay data are not statistically significant .    </S>",
    "<S> it might be argued that our experiment using neutral atoms would be insensitive to the proposed neutrino oscillation effect , since the participation of the remaining atomic electrons could provide a decoherence of the neutrino momentum states in the larger phase space of the final atomic states after the decay . </S>",
    "<S> however , the usual description of electron capture decay suggests that the neutrino and recoil nucleus momenta are determined largely by the structure of the weak interaction hamiltonian . in the case where multiple atomic electrons are present , </S>",
    "<S> there can in principle be interference between contributions from different atomic electronic states . in calculating the total decay rate , or the ratio of k - shell to l - shell electronic capture , or the ratio of electron capture to positron decay , </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino ( and recoil nucleus ) momentum is determined by an overlap integral of the atomic electrons wave functions , summed over electron states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but these calculations , particularly in high - z nuclei such as nd , are dominated by the k - shell contribution , and multiple electron terms represent corrections to the total decay rate of only a few percent @xcite . moreover , our experiment detected k - shell x - rays , meaning that the captured electron was indeed a k - shell electron with a similar wavefunction to the the hydrogenic ions investigated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent atomic de - excitation processes do not greatly influence the generation of the neutrino or recoil momenta . </S>",
    "<S> if multiple electron effects destroy the coherence of the mixed neutrinos momenta in the final state , this would be apparent in data from the gsi group comparing the decay time spectrum of hydrogen - like and helium - like stored ions , similar to data reported in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a further desirable confirmation of the data from the gsi group would be to examine the @xmath37 decays of the hydrogen - like ions , which should show no oscillations on the timescales available for examination , according to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to summarize </S>",
    "<S> , no convincing oscillation was observed in the decay time spectrum of electron capture decays of @xmath0pm ( or in @xmath0eu using published data ) when dressed with their full complement of electrons and at rest in a solid metal matrix . </S>",
    "<S> any 5 second oscillation not resolved in this experiment must have an amplitude a factor of 31 times smaller than that reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed oscillating decay rate could in principle be attributable to the truly two - body nature of the final state in the hydrogen - like decays observed in @xcite , although this would require an unconventional explanation with respect to electron capture decay in neutral atoms . under this hypothesis </S>",
    "<S> , data on the decay of helium - like stored ions would show much different oscillation behavior . </S>"
