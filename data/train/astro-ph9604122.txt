    "there are a number of different techniques which may be used to determine the age of a globular cluster ( gc ) .",
    "all of these methods rely on comparing some aspect of theoretical stellar evolution models to the observations .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate the reliability of the various age indicators , one must be aware of the uncertainties in theoretical stellar evolution models .",
    "the correct treatment of convection in stellar models is an area of active research ( e.g.  kim _ et al . _  1995 , 1996 ;",
    "demarque , guenther & kim 1996a , b ) and remains the largest possible source of error in stellar models .",
    "for this reason , properties of the stellar models which depend on the treatment of convection are the most uncertain .",
    "the main sequence and red giant branch stars in gcs have surface convection zones , and so the predicted radii ( and hence , colours ) are subject to large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the helium burning stars ( horizontal branch , and asymptotic giant branches ) are convective in the energy generation regions , and so even the predicted lifetimes and luminosities of stars in this phase of evolution are somewhat uncertain .",
    "an additional consideration when considering the reliability of stellar models is that observed cno abundances in stars on the red giant branch indicate that some form of deep mixing occurs in these stars , which is _ not _ present in the models ( e.g.  langer et al .",
    "1983 ; kraft 1994 ; chaboyer 1995 ) .",
    "this indicates that the red giant branch models are in need of revision . in contrast",
    ", low mass main sequence models are in excellent agreement with the observations . indeed ,",
    "inversions of solar models which use the observed @xmath2-modes indicate that the run of density and sound speed in solar models agree with the sun to within 1% @xcite .",
    "the relative reliability of the age - luminosity relationship for low mass stars is well known , and it is for this reason that the absolute magnitude of main sequence turn - off ( ) results in gc ages with the smallest theoretical error ( e.g.  renzini 1991 ) .",
    "operationally ,  is defined to be the magnitude of the bluest point on the main sequence .",
    "( since this definition involves the use of colour  is not strictly independent of the uncertainties in stellar radii . ) unfortunately , the turn - off region has nearly the same colour over a large range in magnitude .",
    "this leads to difficulties measuring observationally , due to the scatter in the observed points around the turn - off .",
    "observers typically quote errors of order 0.10 mag in , which leads to an error in the derived age around @xmath3gyr ( e.g.  ( sarajedini & king 1989 ; chaboyer , demarque & sarajedini 1996 , hereafter cds ) .",
    "this large error in the derived age of any individual gc is a great obstacle in furthering our understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "this problem has lead sarajedini & demarque ( 1990 ) and vandenberg , bolte & stetson ( 1990 ) to advocate the use of the difference in colour between the main sequence turn - off and the base of the giant branch ( ) as an age indicator .",
    "this method has the advantage that the colour of the turn - off and the base of the giant branch can be accurately determined in observed colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , and is independent of the distance modulus . as a result",
    ", this method can lead _ in principle _ to very precise age estimates ( of order @xmath4gyr ) .",
    "however , the theoretical colours are subject to large uncertainties and  only yields reliable _ relative _ age differences between clusters of a similar metallicity ( see , however , the case of m68 and m92 (  [ sec3 ] ) for which fails ) .    in this paper",
    ", we advocate the use of a point which is brighter than the turn - off , and 0.05 mag redder in b  v ( hereafter referred to as ) .",
    "this point is easy to measure in observational data and has a small theoretical uncertainty .",
    "as it still requires knowledge of the distance modulus ,  complements the  technique in providing precision age estimates for gcs . in  [ sec2 ] , a monte carlo set of isochrones is described and analyzed in order to estimate the theoretical error associated with  and .",
    "the well studied gc m68 is used to illustrate the relative precision of ages derived using  and  in ",
    "finally ,  [ sec4 ] summarizes the results of this work and suggests that observers should quote  in their papers in addition to .",
    "simple formulae are provided to determine gc ages , given  and .",
    "the basic problem in measuring  is that the turn - off region is nearly vertical in the hr diagram .",
    "thus , the colour of the main sequence turn - off is well defined , but its magnitude is not . as stars evolve off the main sequence they quickly expand , and so points somewhat brighter than the turn - off are more horizontal in the hr diagram .",
    "thus , it is easy to measure the magnitude of , and ages derived using  will have small observational error bars .",
    "the main reason for using  as an age indicator is that it is widely perceived to be the most robust of the theoretical age estimators .",
    "thus , ages derived using  have small theoretical ` error bars ' .",
    "the key question then is whether the theoretical uncertainty in  is similar to that in .",
    "if that is the case , then there would be no reason to use  in gc age estimates .",
    "the theoretical error in  may be estimated by constructing a series of isochrones under a variety of assumptions . in a study designed to provide an estimate of the error associated with gc ages chaboyer ,",
    "demarque , kernan & krauss ( 1996 , hereafter cdkk ) calculated 1000 independent sets of isochrones .",
    "these isochrones were constructed via a monte carlo analysis , whereby the various input elements needed to compute a stellar model and isochrone ( such as opacity , mixing length , etc . ) were picked at random from distributions based on a careful analysis of the recent literature .",
    "table [ tab1 ] provides an outline of the various input parameters and their distribution .",
    "further details are provided in cdkk .",
    "this monte carlo study was designed to yield a set of isochrones which span the range of relevant uncertainties in modern stellar evolution calculations .",
