    "semiconductor self - assembled quantum dots ( saqds)@xcite are islands of one semiconductor , e.g. inas , in a host matrix of another semiconductor , e.g. gaas . the elementary excitations , electrons and holes , are believed to be confined in all three dimensions by the band gap difference between island and matrix materials .",
    "the picture of electrons and holes as confined elementary excitations with effective mass , interacting via coulomb interactions has been successfully applied toward the explanation of many experimental results @xcite .",
    "it is important to establish to what extent the effective - mass picture is applicable to the description of electronic states of self - assembled quantum dots by a systematic comparison of different approaches .",
    "the self - assembled quantum dots plus the surrounding barrier material contain millions of atoms and the density functional _ ab initio _ calculations are not possible yet .",
    "hence in this work we compare two simplified approaches , the multiband @xmath0 method and the tight - binding method with the predictions of the effective - mass calculations .",
    "the multiband @xmath0 method @xcite accounts for the proper structure of the valence band , including heavy , light and spin split - off hole bands .",
    "it is however limited to the top of the valence band , does not account for the atomistic character of the interfaces between the dot and barrier material , and is expected to break down as the size of the nanostructure decreases .",
    "the atomistic structure of the nanostructure is captured in either the tight - binding @xcite or pseudopotential approaches as developed by zunger and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the tight - binding approach chosen here is the effective bond orbital model ( ebom ) @xcite , a version of @xmath2 tight - binding models .",
    "the advantage of ebom is that it extrapolates to the @xmath0 approach making a direct comparison possible .",
    "the disadvantage of ebom is that it misses the lack of inversion symmetry of zincblende structures .",
    "the single particle energy levels are not measured directly .",

    "emission from multi - exciton complexes has been measured by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "the higher the pumping intensity is , the more excitons are involved , thus the emission from higher excited electron and hole states can be observed .",
    "the multi - exciton emission spectra have been interpreted using quantum mechanical methods such as the hartree - fock method and the configuration interaction method ( ci ) @xcite , in which the multi - exciton complex states are constructed from single - particle states of the system .",
    "it is a challenge to combine realistic single - particle states calculated for the million - atom structures with these quantum mechanical methods .",
    "a number of theoretical approaches have been proposed to address this issue , such as combining multiband @xmath3 single - particle states with self - consistent hartree - fock method @xcite and combining single - band effective - mass @xcite or microscopic pseudopotential wave functions @xcite .    in this paper",

    ". similar findings that the effective mass of electrons in quantum dots exceeds the value in the corresponding bulk dot material and approach that in the bulk matrix material and the in - plane component of the effective mass of holes becomes much lighter have been reported @xcite .    in valence bands ,",
    "the heavy hole and light hole are decoupled by the biaxial strain . for dots of small height",

    "this is the reason why these states can be fitted by using single - band approximation . for thick dots ,",
    "the band edges of heavy hole and light hole may cross each other due to the fact that the biaxial strain changes its sign inside the structure , which results in more light - hole components in the hole states in these dots .",

    "a careful examination of the calculated single - particle states shows that all the single - particle states in the conduction band consist of less than @xmath107 component from the split - off band while for valence band states it is less than @xmath108 .",
    "hence , the mixture between spin up and spin down components in any of these states should be very small , i.e. , they are polarized .",
    "however , in the absence of magnetic fields , all the single - particle states calculated by the @xmath0 method and ebom are doubly degenerate due to the time - reversal symmetry @xcite . instead of having two degenerate states",
    ", the numerical calculation can only give one state from a random linear combination of the two polarized and degenerate states .",

    "due to the presence of quasi - shell structure in the single - particle energy spectrum , we chose the first 12 electron and 12 hole states ( with quasispins ) , which form the first three shells in conduction and valence bands , respectively , to build the multi - exciton configurations .    in order to reduce the total number of configurations which grows factorially with the size of single - particle basis set , we impose an additional constraint on the exciton configurations ,",
    "i.e. , the sum of the electron quasi - spins should be equal to that of the hole quasispins @xcite .",
    "we also apply a truncation according to the hartree - fock energies of configurations in order to limit the total number of the configurations to less than @xmath111 .",

    "it predicts that the chemical potential i.e. the energy required to add an electron - hole pair to the system , is independent of the number of excitons .",
    "the symmetry between electron - electron , electron - hole , and hole - hole interactions is broken because the hole states are usually more confined than the electrons in the conduction bands .",

    ", we make use of domain decomposition in the numerical calculation to divide it into a number of smaller matrices and sum up the result of all the individual multiplications .",

    "when the number of single particle states ( either electrons or holes ) is large , a cutoff is necessary to be applied to the total number of electron or hole configurations .",
    "depending on the memory available for the computation , it is set to be between 5000 and 10000 .",
    "once the distance matrix @xmath151 for the exciton configurations is calculated , it is straightforward to construct the configuration interaction matrix as the positions of all the none - zero matrix elements are known .",
