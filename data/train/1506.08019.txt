    "dengue is a vector - borne disease transmitted from an infected human to a female _ aedes _ mosquito by a bite .",
    "the mosquito , which needs regular meals of blood to feed their eggs , bites a potentially healthy human and transmits the disease , turning it into a cycle .",
    "there are four distinct , but closely related , viruses that cause dengue .",
    "the four serotypes , named den-1 to den-4 , belong to the _ flavivirus _ family , but they are antigenically distinct . recovery from infection by one serotype provides lifelong immunity against that serotype but provides only partial and transient protection against subsequent infection by the other three viruses .",
    "there are strong evidences that a sequential infection increases the risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever .",
    "the spread of dengue is attributed to the geographic expansion of the mosquitoes responsible for the disease : _ aedes aegypti _ and _ aedes albopictus_. the _ aedes aegypti _ mosquito is a tropical and subtropical species widely distributed around the world , mostly between latitudes @xmath5n and 35@xmath6s . in urban areas , _ aedes _ mosquitoes breed on water collections in artificial containers such as cans , plastic cups , used tires , broken bottles and flower pots .",
    "due to its high interaction with humans and its urban behavior , the _ aedes aegypti _ mosquito is considered the major responsible for the dengue transmission .",
    "the life cycle of a mosquito has four distinct stages : egg , larva , pupa and adult . in the case of _ aedes aegypti _ , the first three stages take place in , or near , the water , whereas the air is the medium for the adult stage  @xcite .",
    "it is very difficult to control or eliminate _",
    "aedes aegypti _ mosquitoes due to their resiliency , fast adaptation to changes in the environment and their ability to rapidly bounce back to initial numbers after disturbances resulting from natural phenomena ( e.g. , droughts ) or human interventions ( e.g. , control measures ) .",
    "primary prevention of dengue resides mainly in mosquito control .",
    "there are two primary methods : larval control and adult mosquito control , depending on the intended target .",
    "_ larvicide _ treatment is done through long - lasting chemical in order to kill larvae and preferably have world health organization clearance for use in drinking water  @xcite .",
    "_ adulticides _ is the most common measure .",
    "its application can have a powerful impact on the abundance of adult mosquito vector .",
    "however , the efficacy is often constrained by the difficulty in achieving sufficiently high coverage of resting surfaces  @xcite .",
    "the present study addresses a problem of finding the most effective ways of controlling the dengue disease . to this end , a mathematical model for the dengue transmission , including a control variable presented in @xcite , is adopted .",
    "the main contributions are : ( i ) adapting multiobjective optimization methodologies for finding the optimal control in a mathematical model for the dengue transmission , ( ii ) analysis of the search ability of different methods on the resulting optimization problem , ( iii ) discussion of results for the optimal control problem , emphasizing advantages of the proposed approach when compared with results available in the literature .",
    "the aim of the work is to promote multiobjective optimization in epidemiological research community and practice .    the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] describes a mathematical model for the dengue disease transmission .",
    "the problem of finding the optimal control is formulated in section  [ sec : problem ] , including traditional and proposed approaches .",
    "section  [ sec : mo ] presents some general concepts in multiobjective optimization and methods adopted for solving the problem .",
    "section  [ sec : experiments ] presents and discusses our results , obtained by numerical simulations , which includes the comparison of different multiobjective optimization methods , control strategies and dengue dynamics that correspond to different optimal scenarios .",
    "the study is ended with section  [ sec : cons ] of conclusions and some directions of future work .",
    "this section introduces a mathematical model for the dengue disease transmission .",
    "the model is based on a system of ordinary differential equations , and includes the real data of a dengue disease outbreak that occurred in the cape verde archipelago in 2009  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of eight mutually - exclusive compartments representing the human and vector dynamics .",
    "it also includes a control parameter , an adulticide spray , as a measure to fight the disease .",
    "the notation used in the mathematical model includes four epidemiological states for humans :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]      +   +    table  [ tab : hv ] presents the results for the four scalarization methods with respect to the hypervolume .",
    "the best result is obtained by the normal constraint method followed by the @xmath7-constraint method .",
    "both methods minimize @xmath8 , when @xmath9 is used to define the constraint for the objective space reduction .",
    "since the nc method uses evenly distributed points on the ideal plane , the final points on the pareto front approximation are likely to be more evenly distributed than using the usual @xmath7-constraint method .",
    "this allows to achieve the highest hypervolume .",
    "the chebyshev method provides a slightly worse result than the goal attainment method .",
    "this can be because the scalarizing function used by the chebyshev method is nondifferentiable , which usually poses additional difficulties for optimization .",
    "figure  [ fig : methods ] shows the pareto front approximations obtained by the methods .",
    "the plots confirm the previous observations based on the hypervolume values .",
    "the chebyshev and goal attainment methods provide visually similar results .",
    "the @xmath7-constraint method attempts to find evenly distributed points with respect to the uniform division of @xmath9 , whereas the nc method seeks a uniform distribution of points , according to points on the hyperplane passing through the corner points of the pareto front . since the nc method gives clearly",
    "better results for  , solutions obtained by this method will be employed for the analysis of the dengue transmission in what follows .",
    "+     +    figures  [ fig : betahms ] and  [ fig : betamhs ] present the trade - off solutions obtained for different values of transition probabilities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively . as it was seen during discussion of different scalarization methods , the trade - off curve for   exhibits a smooth relation between the insecticide cost , @xmath9 , and the infected human population , @xmath8 , in the range @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that implementing optimal control strategies in this range can produce the most significant reduction in infected individuals , having the highest ratio between the desirable effect and the cost .",
    "however , starting from some further point , reducing the number of infected humans can be achieved through exponential increase in spendings for insecticide .",
    "even a small decrease corresponds to a high increase in expenses for insecticide .",
    "scenarios represented by this part of the trade - off curve can be unacceptable from the economical point of view .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that even with the maximum spending it is not possible to eradicate the disease , with the lowest obtained value of the infected population being 0.0042 .",
    "+   +    to provide a better visualization of the most interesting parts of the trade - off curves in figures  [ fig : betahms ] and  [ fig : betamhs ] , the plots are separated into two parts and presented in different figures , according to the range of @xmath9 . from figures  [ fig : betahms:1 ] and  [ fig :",
    "betamhs:1 ] , it can be seen that the higher the corresponding transition probability , the larger number of infected individuals .",
    "though this difference reduces as more control is applied , vanishing for the extreme scenario with @xmath13 .",
    "varying @xmath10 and @xmath11 produces apparently similar effects on the shape of the pareto front . from figures  [ fig : betahms:1 ] and",
    "[ fig : betamhs:1 ] , it can be observed that for higher values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 the part of the trade - off curve in @xmath12 becomes increasingly nonconvex .",
    "solutions in this region can be unattainable for methods that face difficulties in dealing with nonconvexities in the pareto front .",
    "figure  [ fig : dynamics ] illustrates dengue epidemics , corresponding to extreme scenarios ( @xmath14 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "it can be seen that for higher values of transition probabilities the peak in infected population occurs early , having larger values ( figures  [ fig : dynamics:1 ] and  [ fig : dynamics:2 ] ) . on the other hand , applying the maximum control , @xmath13 , the dynamics of @xmath15 remain unchanged for different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( figures  [ fig : dynamics:3 ] and  [ fig : dynamics:4 ] ) .    to discuss intermediate scenarios , the concept of the knee solution of the pareto front is adopted . according to  @xcite , it can be defined as follows .",
    "given a pareto front with the normalized objectives , a boundary line @xmath16 is constructed though two extreme points @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "for any point @xmath19 on the boundary line @xmath16 , a point @xmath20 on the pareto front along the normal @xmath21 of the boundary line is identified .",
    "the pareto optimal point @xmath22 with the maximum distance from its corresponding boundary point @xmath23 along the normal direction is defined as the knee point .",
    "this concept is illustrated in figure  [ knee ] .",
    "the knee solution of the pareto front is attractive , since it is often considered as the optima in objective trade - offs .",
    "+   +        figure  [ fig : dynamics : knee ] shows the dynamics of the state and control variables for different values of the transition probabilities , corresponding to the knee solution .",
    "it can be seen that more controls are required for higher values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 during the entire period of study , which is consistent with expectations .",
    "however , a higher value of transition probability does not necessarily mean a higher value of infected human population for the knee solution .",
    "this is because the change in the shape of the pareto front caused by varying a value of transition probability .    from the karush - kuhn - tucker condition",
    ", it can be induced that under smoothness assumptions the pareto set of a continuous multiobjective optimization problem defines a piecewise continuous @xmath24-dimensional manifold .",
    "the pareto set of a continuous biobjective optimization problem is a piecewise continuous curve in @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the optimal control for   can be defined as a surface in @xmath26 .",
    "solving   gives a discrete representation of this surface .",
    "thus , figure  [ fig : suface : c ] shows a discrete representation of a surface defining the pareto set for . for a given value of @xmath8 , slicing the surface gives the optimal control trajectory . from the figure ,",
    "it can bee seen how this dynamic changes from @xmath14 to @xmath13 .",
    "a peak is observed in an early period of @xmath27 , which grows in accordance with the decrease in the number of infected humans .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : suface : ih ] shows a discrete representation of a surface defining dynamics of infected humans across the pareto set . a negative correlation between the optimal control and infected population can be observed . as the amount of control decreases , the number of infected humans increases .",
    "for higher values of the control , the peak in @xmath15 is smaller and occurs later .",
    "when the control is reduced , the peak of disease outbreak grows up taking place earlier .    from the above discussion",
    ", it can be seen that the results for the optimal control problem , presented in section  [ sec : problem ] , that are obtained using a multiobjective optimization approach provide comprehensive insights about optimal strategies for dealing with the dengue epidemic and dynamics resulting from implementing those strategies . the ability of trade - off solutions to reflect the underlying nature of the problem constitutes a major advantage of multiobjective optimization , motivating its practical use in the process of planning intervention measures by health authorities",
    "due to difficulties in treating the dengue disease , controlling and preventing its outbreaks is essential for keeping people healthy , especially in regions where the threat of dengue is high .",
    "this study discussed a mathematical model for the dengue disease transmission from the optimal control point of view .",
    "multiobjective optimization approach is suggested for finding the optimal control strategies to deal with an outbreak of the dengue epidemic .",
    "a biobjective optimization problem is formulated , involving minimization of expenses due to the infected population and costs of applying insecticide .",
    "the approach avoids the use of _ a priori _ information provided by the decision maker in the form of weight coefficients and allows to reflect the intrinsic nature of the problem .    the problem is numerically solved by discretizing the control variable and using scalarization methods for approximating multiple pareto optimal solutions .",
    "the obtained results reveal different perspectives on applying insecticide : a low number of infected humans can be achieved spending larger financial resources , whereas low spendings for prevention campaigns result in significant portions of the population affected by the disease",
    ". different trade - offs between the objectives are represented by the obtained solutions .",
    "varying transmission probabilities introduces changes in relation between the objectives and their trade - offs .",
    "because the problem is convex , the pareto set defining the optimal control remains unchanged for different values of transmission probabilities .",
    "the results of the study suggest advantages of multiobjective optimization for finding the optimal control .",
    "once the pareto set is approximated , the final decision on the control strategy can be made taking into consideration available financial resources and goals of public health care .    as future work",
    ", it is intended to extend the model for the dengue transmission including different control variables that represent distinct measures for controlling the disease .",
    "investigating impacts of different values of model parameters is also the subject of future work .",
