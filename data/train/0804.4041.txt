    "large amplitude , low - frequency alfvn waves constitute one of the most essential elements of magnetic fluctuations in the solar corona and solar wind@xcite . due to small collisionless dissipation rates",
    ", the waves can propagate long distance and efficiently convey such macroscopic quantities as momentum , energy , and helicity .",
    "since loading of such quantities is completed when the waves damp away , it is important to examine how the waves can dissipate . among various possible dissipation processes of the alfvn waves ,",
    "parametric instabilities have been believed to be important@xcite .",
    "further , the parametric instabilities of these alfvn waves can cause the developed turbulence , which are believed to produce _ in situ _ the localized structures ( shocks and discontinuities ) in the solar wind@xcite .",
    "however , most past studies using kinetic simulation code mainly discussed the parametric instabilities among parallel propagating waves in one - dimensional system , although the real solar wind is three - dimensional . actually , arguments including obliquely propagating waves have been developed by several authors using the fluid systems@xcite .",
    "these studies clarified that the growth rates involving the oblique waves are usually much smaller than those among parallel propagating waves .    on the other hand , sakai _",
    "et al._@xcite recently performed two - dimensional particle - in - cell ( 2-d pic ) simulations .",
    "they reported that the left - hand ( lh- ) polarized alfvn waves are dissipated through the transverse modulational instability when ion and electron beta is very low ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the past studies using the fluid systems which indicated that parametric instabilities including obliquely propagating daughter waves ( transverse modulation or filamentation instability ) can be dominant only in the high @xmath1 ( the squared normalized sound velocity ) plasma .",
    "one of the purposes of the present study is to clarify the reason of this difference on the type of parametric instabilities between the fluid and the pic simulations .",
    "sakai _ et al._@xcite also reported the electron heating through the modified two stream instability ( mtsi)@xcite which is caused by the difference in ion and electron bulk velocities ( cross - field currents ) . in a presence of finite amplitude alfvn waves ,",
    "the cross - field currents can initially be given by the walen relation .",
    "however , sakai _",
    "et al._@xcite only discussed lh- mode in their paper .",
    "another purpose of this study is to confirm the importance of the mtsi driven by alfvn waves with both right - hand ( rh- ) and left - hand ( lh- ) polarizations , and also by a mixture of alfvn waves ( in which the walen condition is not satisfied ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",

    "a summary and conclusions of this paper are given in section 4 .",
    "we have carried out the 2-d pic simulation@xcite with the system size @xmath2 and @xmath3 with 100 super - particles ( both ions and electrons ) per cell .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 directions , with the uniform ambient magnetic field ( @xmath6 ) in the @xmath4-direction , and the homogeneous plasma ( the zeroth order longitudinal bulk velocity @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and the number density @xmath9 ) .",

    "while our numerical results are basically the same , we conclude that the generation of longitudinal waves are due to the usual , parallel decay instability , rather than the transverse modulational instability proposed by sakai _ et al._@xcite , since the one - dimensional decay instability is dominant in a low beta plasma as the hall - mhd theory predicted@xcite .",
    "further , we performed several other simulation runs using different parent alfvn wave polarizations and different ion thermal velocities . the condition to excite the mtsi",
    "is easily violated by such modifications of the parameters .",
    "thus , the electron heating by the mtsi of the alfvn waves seems unimportant in the upper chromoshpere , since the alfvn waves excited by the convection in the solar surface are likely to be the superposition of alfvn waves with different polarizations and propagating directions , but not the monochromatic , lh- polarized wave .",
    "further , a similar process on obliquely propagating waves have also been suggested by markovskii and hollweg @xcite according to the proton heating . the more detailed analysis on this issue is desired .    while the dominant parametric instabilities are quasi - one dimensional in a low beta case , the transverse modulational instability can be more important in different circumstances .",
    "for instance , the alfvn wave excited by the ion beam instabilities can be dominantly dissipated through the transverse modulational instability , which is nonlinearly driven by the obliquely propagating waves excited by the same beam instabilities@xcite .",
    "further , even if the parametric instabilities are one dimensional , two or three dimensional density structures are excited as a consequence of its nonlinear evolution@xcite .",
    "when the inhomoginity of the background plasmas exist , heating of electrons by phase mixed alfvn waves take place@xcite .",
    "we remark that even in the uniform background plasmas , the electron heating regardless of the mtsi is actually observed in pic simulation ( _ e.g. _ , sakai _",
    "et al._@xcite and fig .",
    "[ 3.2.4 ] ) . the electron heating is possibly caused by numerical noise originated from the super - particles in the pic simulation . to avoid this and confirm the recent results , the electromagnetic vlasov simulations are in plan",
