    "the main motivation for studying double - beta decay is clear : to shed light upon the nature of the neutrino .",
    "though much has been discovered in the field of the neutrino since its conception and later discovery , some very basic traits remain unknown .",
    "two of these are the majorana or dirac nature of the neutrino , and the particle s mass .",
    "observation of neutrinoless double - beta ( 0@xmath8 ) decay would answer the question of the nature of the neutrino while simultaneously determining the mass , assuming the nuclear matrix elements ( nmes ) for that particular nuclear transition are known . here",
    ", the study of two - neutrino double - beta ( 2@xmath8 ) decay can prove useful by providing experimental data which can be used to test and calibrate theoretical models needed to calculate 0@xmath8 nmes @xcite .",
    "a study of the rate of the 2@xmath8 decay of @xmath0nd to excited final states of @xmath0sm will be described .",
    "this work took place both at triangle universities nuclear laboratory ( tunl ) and at kimballton underground research facility ( kurf ) .",
    "the 2@xmath8 decay rate , @xmath9 , can be described by the following equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 contains phase space integrals and relevant constants and is dependent on the q - value of the decay , and @xmath12 represents the fermi ( f ) and gamow - teller ( gt ) components of the 2@xmath8 decay nmes .",
    "ideal nuclei for 2@xmath8 decay studies have a high q - value and large nmes .",
    "there are 35 nuclei that undergo 2@xmath8 , but only 11 ( @xmath13ca , @xmath14ge , @xmath15se , @xmath16zr , @xmath17mo , @xmath18pd , @xmath19cd , @xmath20sn , @xmath21te , @xmath22xe , and @xmath0nd ) have a q - value which is practical for experimental use .",
    "this q - value restriction is about 2 mev ; below that , such a rare decay could get overwhelmed by natural radiation . of the 11 aforementioned nuclei ,",
    "the double - beta decay to the ground state of ten has been measured : @xmath13ca , @xmath14ge , @xmath15se , @xmath16zr , @xmath17mo , @xmath19cd , @xmath23te , @xmath21te , @xmath0nd , @xmath22xe and ( not previously listed ) @xmath24u ( see @xcite for an excellent compilation of these results ) . however , the neutrinoless mode has not yet been observed .    besides the q - value",
    ", other quantities which can be considered in order to maximize the experiment s success in detecting double - beta decay include natural abundance , availability of the isotope , possibility of enrichment , and source cost",
    ". to optimize the source efficiency , the number of isotope nuclei must be maximized , which is heavily dependent on the abundance , enrichment possibility , and availability of the isotope .",
    "one of the best candidates for 0@xmath8 searches is @xmath0nd .",
    "it has the second highest q - value ( q@xmath253.37 mev ) and the largest phase - space factor of all 0@xmath8 candidates @xcite , and has a natural abundance of 5.64% . although @xmath0nd is strongly deformed , calculations by fang _",
    "@xcite show that the deformation suppresses the 0@xmath8 nme by only about 40% .",
    "very recently , a novel decay channel of the scissors mode 1@xmath26 to the first excited 0@xmath27 state ( 0@xmath1 ) of @xmath28gd was reported by beller _",
    "@xcite , implying a much larger matrix element than previously thought for the 0@xmath8 decay to the 0@xmath1 state in the shape transitional regions of the n=90 isotones .",
    "in fact , it was argued in @xcite that the 0@xmath8 decay of @xmath0nd to the 0@xmath1 state in @xmath0sm may be slightly favored over the transition to the 0@xmath27 ground state due to the calculated nuclear matrix element ratio m@xmath29)=1.6 .",
    "if the reduced phase space for the 0@xmath1 transition is taken into account , the ratio of the partial decay rates can be calculated using @xmath30/\\lambda_{0\\nu\\beta\\beta}[0^+_{gs}]=(g_{0\\nu}(0^+_1)|m^{(0\\nu)}[0^+_1]|^2)/(g_{0\\nu}(0^+_{gs})|m^{(0\\nu)}[0^+_{gs}]|^2)=1.2 $ ] @xcite .",

    "<S> background : :    double - beta decay is a rare nuclear process in which two neutrons in    the nucleus are converted to two protons with the emission of two    electrons and two electron anti - neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> purpose : :    we measured the half life of the two - neutrino double - beta decay of    @xmath0nd to excited final states of    @xmath0sm by detecting the de - excitation gamma rays of    the daughter nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> method : :    this study yields the first detection of the coincidence gamma rays    from the 0@xmath1 excited state of @xmath0sm .    </S>",
    "<S> these gamma rays have energies of 333.97 kev and 406.52 kev , and are    emitted in coincidence through a    0@xmath22@xmath20@xmath3    transition . </S>",
    "<S> results : :    the enriched nd@xmath4o@xmath5 sample consisted of    40.13 g @xmath0nd and was observed for 642.8 days at the    kimballton underground research facility , producing 21.6 net events in    the region of interest . </S>",
    "<S> this count rate gives a half life of    @xmath6    years . </S>",
    "<S> the effective nuclear matrix element was found to be    0.0465@xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , lower limits were    obtained for decays to higher excited final states . </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : :    our half - life measurement agrees within uncertainties with another    recent measurement in which no coincidence was employed . </S>",
    "<S> our nuclear    matrix element calculation may have an impact on a recent neutrinoless    double - beta decay nuclear matrix element calculation which implies the    decay to the first excited state in @xmath0sm is favored    over that to the ground state . </S>"
