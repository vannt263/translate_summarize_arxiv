    "damped lyman-@xmath0 ( dla ) absorbers are very important probes of neutral hydrogen ( h  i ) in the distant universe . these high h  i column density structures ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) , seen against the quasar continuum emission , are believed to contain most of the neutral gas at high redshift , and are supposed to be the main sites of star formation and the precursors of galaxies .",
    "a detailed study of the physical conditions of these high column density systems is , therefore , necessary for understanding galaxy formation and evolution and the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "dlas are also useful tools to address cosmological problems ( e.g. , the evolution of fundamental constants ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in spite of the significant amount of work already done on this subject , properties of dlas , such as density , h  i temperature , structure and size , are still unsettled ( e.g. , * ?",
    "the issue of redshift evolution of these properties is also controversial @xcite .",
    "one particular interesting issue in this regard is the temperature of the absorbing gas .",
    "radio frequency observations of redshifted h  i 21 cm _ absorption _ lines from dlas , against suitable background radio continuum sources ( e.g. radio loud quasars ) , are widely used to constrain the spin temperatures ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "it has been argued that the derived values show a trend of high @xmath5 at higher @xmath6 , but both high and low value of @xmath5 are observed at low @xmath6 .",
    "processes like collision and resonant scattering of lyman-@xmath0 photons generally couple @xmath5 with the kinetic temperature , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "so a higher @xmath5 implies a higher average @xmath7 of the neutral gas , or equivalently a smaller fraction of cold gas , at high @xmath6 .",
    "if true , this may be a very important constraint in galaxy evolution models .",
    "however , this trend is so far deduced mostly from low redshift measurements and a few lower limits of @xmath5 based on non - detection of h  i 21 cm absorption at higher redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also possible that the compact reservoirs of h  i observed against large radio continuum sources have covering factors smaller than the assumed value of unity , so @xmath5 smaller than those reported @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the optical and radio lines of sight could be drastically different @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are contradicting evidences of both cold and warm gas in high redshift dlas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are not consistent with any strong trend .",
    "given the importance of these results in galaxy evolution models , it is necessary to address these issues critically and in much greater details .    naturally , the main problem here is the lack of h  i 21  cm absorption studies and detections at higher redshift .",
    "most such studies are focused on low redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to our knowledge , there are only four reported detections of 21  cm absorption at @xmath8 @xcite and just two cases of confirmed detection at @xmath9 : towards pks  @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and towards j@xmath12 ( @xmath13 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in light of this",
    ", we have started a program of very deep observations of high redshift dlas with the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in an attempt to increase the number of such observations at @xmath9 ; our goal is to constrain @xmath5 and to address some of the above mentioned issues systematically .",
    "high sensitivity of the telescope , and the spatial and spectral resolution of the instrument make gmrt suitable for this project . note that the gmrt 325 mhz receiver covers the h  i 21  cm line for a redshift range of @xmath14 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) damped lyman-@xmath0 survey catalogue @xcite is used to identify a total of @xmath15 sources in this redshift range and @xmath16 .",
    "out of these , @xmath17 have radio continuum counterpart detected in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so are suitable for h  i 21  cm absorption studies . in this _",
    "letter _ we report results for two sources from this sample for which we have carried out deep gmrt observations and analysis . these sources are j@xmath18 and j@xmath19 . in  [",
    "sec : obs ] , the details of the observations and data analysis are outlined , while the results are in  [ sec : rslt ] .",
    "a brief discussion on the implications of the results are in  [ sec : dis ] , and the conclusions are presented in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "j@xmath18 is a quasar at @xmath20 , with a 1.4 ghz flux density of @xmath21 mjy ( from nvss ) .",
    "the dla system towards this background source is at a redshift of @xmath22 with @xmath23 . the second source",
    ", j@xmath19 is at @xmath24 with nvss @xmath25 mjy , and the dla system is at @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "for the first source , the flux density at @xmath28 mhz from the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is @xmath29 mjy , but the field of the second source was not covered by wenss .",
    "the gmrt observations were carried out during observing cycle 20 ( project i d 20_026 ) on 2011 may 20 - 27 .",
    "a total of 72 hours of observing time was scheduled for these two sources , but some of the observing runs were affected by bad weather . as a result , additional 24 hours of reobservation time was scheduled on 2012 february 7 - 8 .",
    "the effective on - source time was @xmath30 hours per source , and the rest ( about @xmath31 ) was spent on observation setup and calibration overheads .    for these observations",
    ", we used the gmrt 325 mhz receiver with a baseband bandwidth of 1 mhz ( centred at the redshifted h  i frequency for the corresponding @xmath32 value ) divided into 256 spectral channels .",
    "this resulted in a spectral resolution of @xmath33 km s@xmath34 and a total bandwidth coverage of @xmath35 km s@xmath34 .",
    "standard calibrators , 3c  147 , 3c  286 , and 3c  48 , were observed to calibrate the flux density scale .",
    "two more calibrator sources , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , were also observed as phase calibrators for j@xmath18 and j@xmath19 respectively .",
    "standard data reduction and analysis were carried out using the astronomical image processing system of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao aips ) .",
    "bad data were carefully flagged before flux , phase and bandpass calibrations .",
    "a very stable spectral bandshape is required to detect any weak h  i absorption line .",
    "hence , the strong phase calibrators , along with all the flux calibrators , were also used for bandpass calibration , and an interpolated bandpass solution was applied to the target source data .",
    "the flagged and calibrated data for the same source from multiple days of observing runs were then combined together and self - calibrated using the initial continuum image .",
    "the final continuum flux density was found to be @xmath38 mjy , in good agreement with the wenss flux density , for j@xmath18 . for j@xmath19 , however , we found two more point sources very close to the target ( within the nvss synthesized beam , and hence unresolved by nvss ) ; the flux density of the target quasar is only @xmath39 mjy .",
    "the continuum subtracted data were then used to produce the spectral image cubes , and the spectra were extracted for both the lines of sight from the corresponding positions of the unresolved continuum sources . finally , the measured continuum flux densities were used to convert the flux density spectra to optical depth spectra assuming a covering factor of unity .",
    "the final spectra for both the lines of sight are shown in figure  [ fig : specs ] . with the long integration time on each source",
    ", we reached very good ( sub mjy per @xmath40 km  s@xmath34 ) rms noise sensitivity limits , but h  i 21  cm absorption is not detected towards either of these lines of sight .",
    "the spectral rms noise values are @xmath41 mjy per @xmath42 km  s@xmath34 for j@xmath19 , @xmath43 mjy ( may 2011 ) and @xmath44 mjy ( feb . 2012 ) per @xmath33 km  s@xmath34 for j@xmath18 .",
    "the final rms optical depths at these velocity resolutions are @xmath45 and @xmath46 for j@xmath18 and j@xmath19 respectively . based on the known h  i column densities from sdss for these dla systems",
    ", one can now constrain the spin temperature @xmath5 .",
    "we use the standard relation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the covering factor , and assume that the integral is over a gaussian profile with a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath49 km  s@xmath34 .",
    "the rms optical depths finally translate to @xmath50 limits of @xmath51 and @xmath52 k for j@xmath18 and j@xmath19 respectively .",
    "neither of the target sources , unfortunately , have reported very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations , which are critical to measure @xmath53 and break the degeneracy between @xmath5 and @xmath53 .",
    "however , based on a sample of @xmath54 background radio sources with foreground dlas , @xcite reported a median covering factor of @xmath55 , with a minimum value of @xmath56 and no significant trend with @xmath6 . adopting @xmath57 and @xmath58 km  s@xmath34",
    ", the current non - detection limits will imply @xmath59 and @xmath60 k for these two systems .",
    "even for @xmath61 , @xmath5 for both the systems are above @xmath62 k. note that an fwhm @xmath63 km  s@xmath34 corresponds to pure thermal broadening for @xmath64 k gas .    to compare the present limits with measurements or limits of @xmath5 from earlier similar observations , we have compiled information from the literature reporting the redshifted h  i 21  cm absorption studies of high redshift ( @xmath65 ) dlas . in the redshift range of @xmath66 ( that is , the age of the universe @xmath67 gyr for standard cosmological parameters h@xmath68 km  s@xmath34mpc@xmath34 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) , we found @xmath71 reported detections and @xmath72 ( including the two from this work ) non - detections of h  i absorption @xcite with the value ( or the limit ) of @xmath5 ( or @xmath73@xmath53 ) in the literature .",
    "for all six cases of detection and @xmath74 of the non - detections , the covering factor @xmath48 is also available .",
    "the median value of @xmath48 is @xmath75 for this sample of @xmath76 sources , and there is , again , no statistical trend with redshift . for the other @xmath77 sources , we used the median value of @xmath78 to estimate , in a statistical sense , the expected @xmath5 limits from the @xmath73@xmath53 limits . if , for a given source , multiple estimates are available in the literature , we used the most updated , sensitive and best estimate . figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the redshift and column density distribution of the whole sample .",
    "we note a selection trend here , though based on a small number statistics : radio observations for h  i absorption studies appear to have targeted low n(h  i ) systems at the lower end of the @xmath65 redshift range , but both low and high n(h  i ) systems at higher redshifts .",
    "it is worth remembering that the target selection criteria are very different in different studies , and hence the collated sample is expected to be significantly heterogeneous as well as incomplete .",
    "a comparison of our @xmath5 limits with other @xmath5 measurements and limits are shown in figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the @xmath5 values with redshifts and h  i column densities are shown in the left and the right panel respectively . the two filled circles , showing the limits from the present work , near the top right corner of the left panel are evidently very strong constraints on @xmath5 at the high @xmath6 end .",
    "the dotted lines in both the panels of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] approximately mark the lower envelope of the measured @xmath5 values and limits ; this suggests that the minimum @xmath5 increases with both @xmath6 and n(h  i )",
    ". however , this conclusion comes dominantly from h  i non - detections , and only few measurements .",
    "more such deep observations to constrain @xmath5 tightly for more dlas and to improve the statistical significance are certainly required to draw any definitive conclusions .",
    "finally , we note that in near future the new and upcoming low frequency telescopes will mediate a significant progress in this field .",
    "in particular , in about an year , the ongoing upgradation of the gmrt will offer a seamless frequency coverage of @xmath79 mhz , and a slightly better sensitivity at @xmath80 mhz due to improved low noise amplifiers ( lnas ) .",
    "these will make a larger redshift window available for h  i 21 cm observations of dlas , and will expand the horizon of dla studies .",
    "redshift evolution of physical properties of the gas in dlas has been a topic of much discussion .",
    "if real , the observed trend of higher average @xmath5 at high @xmath6 will imply a lower fraction of cold gas at high redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may have important implications regarding cosmic evolution of properties / morphologies of dla host galaxies .",
    "thus , the issue is also related to the hierarchical galaxy formation models . alternatively , @xcite attributed it to a lower covering factor at high @xmath6 . on the other hand , based on c  ii@xmath81 observations , @xcite argued for the presence of a large fraction of cold gas in high @xmath6 dlas , and suggested that the radio and optical lines of sight are completely different .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the observed trend is most likely _ not _ caused by the above two reasons , and is due to a real evolution of the cold gas fraction .",
    "one crucial argument in this context comes from the observed anti - correlation between @xmath5 and metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite , however , find no such anti - correlation , either due to possible redshift evolution or due to a small range of metallicity in their sample .",
    "@xcite noted that a mass - metallicity relation in dlas ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for details ) can naturally result in a larger cold gas fraction due to efficient cooling via metal line transitions for high metallicity systems , and leads to the observed anti - correlation .",
    "while this reinforces the evidence for an evolution of the cold gas fraction , @xcite can not completely rule out the possibility of a local origin of the relation due to significant metallicity gradients  a `` line - of - sight effect '' of higher metallicity and lower temperature for sightlines passing through the central regions and vice versa .    in this local origin scenario ( i.e. if dla hosts are large galaxies with internal metallicity and/or temperature gradients ) , one would expect to see an anti - correlation between the h  i column density and the spin temperature as well .",
    "for example , in diffuse h  i of the milky way , @xmath5 is higher for lower n(h  i ) sightlines .",
    "this has been reported recently by @xcite from galactic h  i observations along @xmath82 lines of sight .",
    "a similar anti - correlation is also evident for a larger sample of @xmath83 lines of sight from the millennium arecibo 21  cm absorption - line survey @xcite .",
    "we do not see such anti - correlation for dlas .",
    "rather , we see a weak correlation between n(h  i ) and @xmath5 ( see figure  [ fig : fig3 ] right panel ) , which , we argue below , is probably a `` secondary correlation '' .",
    "the number of measurements , particularly at the high n(h  i ) end , in the current sample is too small to draw any stronger conclusion at this point .",
    "however , the lack of any n(h  i )  @xmath5 _ anti - correlation _ indicates that local origin is an incorrect explanation ( for the reported anti - correlation between @xmath5 and metallicity ) .      while discussing n(h  i ) ",
    "@xmath5 correlation , it is important to remember that @xmath5 is a derived quantity . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we instead show the measurements or upper limits of directly observed quantities , equivalent velocity width ( @xmath84 ) , with @xmath6 and n(h  i ) .",
    "there is a weak indication of lower equivalent width at higher redshift , but no significant correlation with n(h  i ) is evident in this plot .",
    "so , the observed n(h  i ) ",
    "@xmath5 `` correlation '' is consistent with random equivalent velocity widths , and is most likely a secondary correlation that arises because @xmath5 is derived from observables @xmath84 and _ also _",
    "n(h  i ) itself .",
    "note that for a sample with a similar redshift range , @xcite also found no @xmath84 ",
    "n(h  i ) correlation , while @xcite reported a correlation for a sample with a larger redshift range .",
    "is it possible that the redshift evolution of @xmath5 is also a secondary correlation due to some selection effects ? we have noted from figure  [ fig : fig2 ] , that the current sample consists of both low and high n(h  i ) dlas at high @xmath6 , but selectively only low n(h  i ) dlas at low @xmath6 .",
    "the sdss full sample does not have this selection effect .",
    "if @xmath5 is approximately constant over the redshift range , one would then , for this sample , expect a lower value of equivalent width at low @xmath6 , but a higher mean ( and larger spread ) at high @xmath6 . in the data ,",
    "we see an opposite trend  a weak indication of an anti - correlation between redshift and equivalent width .",
    "so , it seems that the redshift evolution of the spin temperature ( and/or of the equivalent width ) is real , and not merely a selection effect .",
    "we note that the interdependence n(h",
    "i ) @xmath85 @xmath86 makes it hard to decide , from the very limited sample , whether one of these correlations ( spin temperature and equivalent width with redshift ) is `` primary '' , and the other one arises only as a secondary effect , or if both have real physical significance .",
    "there is some discussion in this regard by @xcite based on the argument that a primary correlation is expected to have higher significance .",
    "more observations and careful comparison with theoretical models ( e.g. with predicted spin temperature _ and _ velocity spread from the hierarchical galaxy formation models ) are certainly required to address these issues .",
    "we have presented results from low frequency radio observations of two dlas at @xmath87 . based on non - detections of redshifted 21 cm absorption ,",
    "the spin temperature @xmath50 limits are @xmath88 k for both the systems .",
    "these are very strong limits for dlas at such high redshift .",
    "a compilation from the literature of @xmath5 measurements and limits for dlas at @xmath65 shows a clear indication of higher average gas temperature at high redshift . from the absence of n(h",
    "i )  @xmath5 anti - correlation , we conclude that the reported anti - correlation between @xmath5 and metallicity is unlikely to be a local , line of sight effect .",
    "we also argue that the observed trend of higher @xmath5 at high @xmath6 is neither a selection effect nor a derived secondary correlation , but a true , physical evolution .",
    "this implies a smaller fraction of cold gas in dlas at high redshift , likely because of lower metallicity at high redshift .",
    "access to a larger redshift range in near future for such studies will definitely be very useful .",
    "we thank aritra basu , rahul basu , prasun dutta , and the staff of the gmrt who have made these observations possible .",
    "gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
