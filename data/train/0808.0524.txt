    "adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and smooth particle hydrodynamics methods indicate that primordial stars form in the first cosmological dark matter halos to reach masses of a few 10@xmath0 @xmath1 at @xmath2 20 - 30 , and that due to inefficient h@xmath3 cooling they are likely very massive , 30 - 500 @xmath1 ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "with surface temperatures of @xmath4 10@xmath0 k and ionizing emissivity rates of 10@xmath5 s@xmath6 , these stars profoundly alter the halos that give birth to them , creating h ii regions 2.5 - 5 kpc in radius and sweeping half of the baryons in the halo into a dense shell that grows to the virial radius of the halo by the end of the life of the star , as first pointed out by ( * ? ? ?",

    "while single stars form consecutively in halos , gravitational mergers consolidate them into larger structures .",
    "numerical attempts to follow this process find that primordial supernovae expel their heavy elements into low - density voids , where star formation is not possible .",
    "the metals return to their halos of origin on timescales of 50 - 100 myr by accretion infall and mergers and , having been diluted by their expulsion into the igm , are taken up into later generations of stars relatively slowly . however , the large computational boxes required to follow the formation of halos from cosmological initial conditions prevents them from fully resolving the explosions .",
    "furthermore , the blasts themselves are not properly initialized , being set up as static bubbles of thermal energy rather than the free expansions that actually erupt through the atmosphere of the star .",
    "if the explosion is initialized in an h ii region and one is not concerned with the transport of metals or fine structure cooling , thermal bombs yield an acceptable approximation to gas motion on kiloparsec scales . however , this approach can not capture the mixture of heavy elements with ambient gas or the subsequent formation of dense enriched clumps due to metal line cooling for two reasons . first , the thermal bubble does create large pressure gradients that accelerate gas outward into the surrounding medium , but because the ejecta has no initial momentum and dynamically couples to surrounding gas at low density ( @xmath7 1 cm@xmath6 ) , not all the metals are launched out into the halo .",
    "our numerical experiments demonstrate that unphysically large amounts of heavy elements remain at the origin of the coordinate grid when the explosion is implemented in this manner .",
    "second , the early evolution of the thermal pulse is different from that of a free expansion , which exhibits the formation of reverse shocks and contact discontinuities that would destabilize in 3d and cause mixing at fairly small radii . since dynamical instabilities in the blast that are mediated by line cooling",
    "are highly nonlinear , it is crucial to follow them from their earliest stages , something that can not be accomplished with thermal bubbles .    if instead the progenitor fails to ionize the halo , densities at the center remain high , in excess of 10@xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "when the supernova is initialized with thermal energy in this environment , all the energy of the blast is radiated away before any of the surrounding gas can be driven outward .",
    "since the energy of the explosion is deposited as heat at the center of the grid , the temperature skyrockets to billions of degrees , instantly ionizing the gas collisionally .",
    "bremsstrahlung and inverse compton cooling time scales at these densities and temperatures are extremely short , leading earlier studies to erroneously conclude that such blasts fizzle. in reality , even though 90% of the energy of the explosion may be lost in the first 2 - 3 years , the momentum of the free expansion can not be radiated away , guaranteeing some propagation of ejecta out into the halo",
    ". we present a new series of population iii supernova models in both neutral and ionized cosmological minihalos to address these difficulties .",

    "our 1d survey of primordial supernova remnant energetics in cosmological halos strongly suggest that when metals and metal line cooling are included in the next generation of 3d models , dynamical instabilities will strongly mix the surrounding gas with heavy elements .",
    "this may lead to a second , prompt generation of stars forming in either the enriched dense shell of the relic h ii region or deeper inside a neutral halo .",
    "if so , the first protogalaxies may have had far more stars than in current models .",
    "large infall rates in trapped explosions may also be efficient at fueling the growth of the compact remnant of less massive progenitors , possibly providing the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in most large galaxies today .",
