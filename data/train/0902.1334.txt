    "equilibrium systems consisting of a large number of degrees of freedom exhibit phase transitions as a consequence of the collective behavior of many components @xcite .",
    "the universal behaviors near critical points have been studied extensively using field theoretical methods and renormalization group ( rg ) techniques @xcite . in systems driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium , collective behaviors can lead to dynamic instabilities and non - equilibrium phase transitions @xcite .",
    "while the study of non - equilibrium critical points has remained a big challenge , rg methods have in some cases been applied @xcite .",
    "an important example for non - equilibrium critical behavior is a homogeneous oscillatory instability or hopf bifurcation of coupled oscillators @xcite .",
    "such instabilities are important in many physical , chemical , and biological systems @xcite . from the point of view of statistical physics ,",
    "phase coherent oscillations result as the collective behavior of a large number of degrees of freedom in the thermodynamic limit . for a system of finite size",
    ", fluctuations destroy the phase coherence of the oscillations and the singular behaviors characteristic of a hopf bifurcation are concealed .",
    "this general idea can be illustrated by individual oscillators arranged on a lattice in a @xmath0-dimensional space and coupled to their nearest neighbors . as a consequence of fluctuations in the system , each oscillator is subject to a noise source .",
    "for small coupling strength and as a result of fluctuations , the oscillators have individual phases and exhibit a limited coherence time of oscillations . in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", a global phase emerges beyond a critical coupling strength where oscillations become coherent over large distances . as this critical point",
    "is approached from the disordered phase , a correlation length , which corresponds to the characteristic size of the domains of synchronized oscillators , diverges . at the same time , oscillations become coherent over long periods of time and long range phase order appears .",
    "the divergence of the correlation length allows a description of the critical behaviors of spatially extended systems in terms of continuous field theories and is characteristic of scale - invariance in the critical regime .",
    "it constitutes the foundation of the renormalization group ( rg ) theory , which explains the emergence of universality at critical points @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we perform an rg study of the critical behaviors of a collection of oscillators , distributed on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice and coupled via nearest neighbors interactions .",
    "we approach the critical point from the disordered phase .",

    "we apply field theoretical perturbation theory in a @xmath4 dimensional space and introduce an rg scheme that is appropriate for the study of coupled oscillators .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ se.gentheo ] , we present the general field theoretical framework for the complex ginzburg - landau equation . we introduce in section [ se.oscframe ] an oscillating reference frame that is essential to define the rg procedure for oscillating critical systems and in which the phase and frequency of the oscillations are eliminated .",

    "these mean field results are relevant above the critical dimension @xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath6 , mean field theory breaks down .",
    "we discuss in section [ se.rgwils ] the renormalization group of the complex ginzburg - landau field theory using a wilson s rg scheme for which the renormalization procedure for critical oscillators can be introduced most clearly .",
    "one - loop order calculations in perturbation theory are presented , but further calculations are necessary to characterize the correct qualitative structure of the rg flow . in section [ se.rg ] , we present the callan - symanzik s rg scheme for systems of coupled oscillators and calculate its beta functions as well as its complete rg flow and fixed points to two - loop order in perturbation theory .",
    "the physical properties of the oscillating system are characterized by correlation and response functions . in section [ se.asymcritbehav ]",
    ", we discuss the asymptotic behaviors of these functions in the critical regime using the rg flow and applying a matching procedure .",
    "the formal relation of the rg fixed point for critical oscillators to the fixed point of a real ginzburg - landau theory ( which satisfies a fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) relation ) leads to an emergent symmetry at the critical point .",
    "however , the system operates far from thermodynamic equilibrium and breaks the fd relation .",
    "the degree of this violation can be characterized by the introduction of a frequency - dependent effective temperature which diverges with a universal anomalous power - law at the critical point .",
    "we conclude our presentation with a discussion of the general properties of critical oscillators , their relations to equilibrium critical points and possible experimental systems for which the critical behaviors discussed here could be observed in the future .",
