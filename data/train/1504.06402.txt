    "shape optimization problems are a very challenging field in mathematical analysis and has attracted more and more attention in the last decade .",
    "one of the most discussed and oldest problems is certainly the task of finding the shape of a body inside a fluid having the least resistance .",
    "this problem dates back at least to newton , who proposed this topic in a rotationally symmetric setting .",
    "nowadays , there are a lot of important industrial applications leading to this kind of questions . among others we mention in particular the problem of optimizing the shape of airplanes , cars and wind turbine blades in order to have least resistance or biomechanical applications like bypass constructions .",
    "the wide fields of applications may be one of the reasons that shape optimization problems in fluids received growing attention recently .",
    "nevertheless , those problems turn out to be very challenging and so far no overall mathematical concept has been successful in a general sense .",
    "one of the main difficulties certainly is that shape optimization problems are often not well - posed , i.e. , no minimizer exists , compare for instance @xcite .",
    "there are some contributions leading to mathematically well - posed problem formulations , see for instance @xcite , but the geometric restrictions are difficult to handle numerically .",
    "the most common approaches used in practice parametrize the boundary of the unknown optimal shape by functions , see for instance @xcite .",
    "however , those formulations do not inherit a minimizer in general .",
    "for numerical simulations typically shape sensitivity analysis is used . here , one uses local boundary variations in order to find a gradient of the cost function with respect to the design variable , which is in this case the shape of the body .",
    "the necessary calculations are carried out without considering the existence or regularity of a minimizer .",
    "but in the end one obtains a mathematical structure that can be used for numerical implementations .    in @xcite ,",
    "a phase field approach was introduced for minimizing general volume functionals in a navier  stokes flow . for this purpose , the porous medium approach proposed by borrvall and petersson @xcite and a ginzburg ",
    "landau regularization as in the work of bourdin and chambolle @xcite were combined .",
    "the latter is a diffuse interface approximation of a perimeter regularization .",
    "this leads to a model where existence of a minimizer can be guaranteed , and at the same time necessary optimality conditions can be derived and used for numerical simulations , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , this approach replaces the free boundary @xmath0 of the body @xmath1 by a diffuse interface .",
    "hence , it is a priori not clear how to deal with objective functionals that are defined on the free boundary @xmath0 .    in this work ,",
    "we study the following boundary objective functional : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a given function , @xmath4 denotes the velocity field of the fluid , @xmath5 denotes the pressure , @xmath6 is the _ inner _ unit normal of the fluid region , i.e. , pointing from the body @xmath1 into the complementary fluid region @xmath7 .",
    "the velocity @xmath4 and pressure @xmath5 are assumed to obey the stationary navier ",
    "stokes equations inside the fluid region @xmath8 , and the no - slip condition on @xmath0 , namely ,    [ introns ] @xmath9    where @xmath10 denotes the stress tensor of the velocity field @xmath4 , @xmath11 denotes the viscosity of the fluid , @xmath12 denotes an external body force , and @xmath13 denotes the identity tensor",
    ".    an important example of @xmath3 is the hydrodynamic force component acting on @xmath0 with the force direction defined by the unit vector @xmath14 : @xmath15 and so becomes @xmath16 if @xmath14 is parallel to the direction of the flow , then represents the drag of the object @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath14 is perpendicular to the direction of the flow , then represents the lift of the object .    in the work at hand we propose an approach on how to deal with boundary objective functionals in the phase field setting . to be precise",
    ", we aim to minimize an appropriate phase field approximation of the functional , and also the functional , which can be considered as one of the most important objectives in shape optimization in fluids .",
    "the fluid is assumed to be an incompressible , newtonian fluid described by the stationary navier  stokes equations .    for this purpose ,",
    "we first discuss how we model the integral over the free boundary @xmath0 if it is replaced by a diffuse interface and how the normal @xmath6 can be defined in this setting , see section [ sec : derivationphasefield ] .",
    "afterwards , we analyze the phase field problem for both and and discuss the existence of a minimizer and optimality conditions , see section [ sec : analysisphasefield ] . in section [ sec : sharpinterfaceasymp ] ,",
    "we focus on the hydrodynamic force functional and the corresponding phase field problem is then related to the sharp interface free boundary problem with a perimeter regularization by the method of matched formal asymptotic expansions .",
    "we find that the formal sharp interface limit of the optimality system gives the same results as can be found in the shape sensitivity literature .",
    "we then solve the phase field problem numerically , see section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "for this purpose , we derive a gradient flow equation for the reduced objective functional and arrive in a cahn  hilliard type system .",
    "after time discretization , this system is treated in every time step by a newton method .",
    "we numerically solve shape optimization problems involving drag and the lift - to - drag ratio .",
    "let us assume that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , is a fixed domain with lipschitz boundary . inside this fixed domain",
    "@xmath19 we may have certain parts filled with fluid , denoted by @xmath8 , and the complement @xmath20 is some non - permeable medium . in the following",
    "we will denote by @xmath6 the outer unit normal of @xmath1 , i.e. , the inner unit normal of the fluid region .",
    "the aim is to minimize the functional , given by , where @xmath21 , subject to the navier  stokes equations .",
    "we additionally impose a volume constraint on the amount of fluid . for this purpose",
    "we choose @xmath22 and only use fluid regions @xmath23 fulfilling the constraint @xmath24 .",
    "we prescribe some inflow or outflow regions on the boundary of @xmath19 and choose for this purpose @xmath25 such that @xmath26 . additionally , we may have some body force @xmath27 acting on the design domain . note that throughout this paper we denote @xmath28-valued functions and spaces consisting of @xmath28-valued functions in boldface .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , problems like this are generally not well - posed in the sense that the existence of a minimizer can not be guaranteed .",
    "hence , we use an additional perimeter regularization . for this purpose , we add a multiple of the perimeter of the obstacle to the cost functional . in order to properly formulate the resulting problem",
    "we introduce a design function @xmath29 , where @xmath30 describes the fluid region and @xmath31 is its complement .",
    "the volume constraint reads in this setting as @xmath32 .",
    "the design functions are chosen to be functions of bounded variation , such that the fluid region has finite perimeter , i.e. , @xmath33 .",
    "we shall write @xmath34 for the perimeter of some set of bounded variation @xmath35 in @xmath19 . besides , if @xmath36 is a function of bounded variation , its distributional derivative @xmath37 is a finite radon measure and we can define the total variation by @xmath38 . for @xmath33",
    ", it holds that @xmath39    for a more detailed introduction to the theory of sets of finite perimeter and functions of bounded variation we refer to @xcite .",
    "we hence arrive in the following space of admissible design functions : @xmath40    let @xmath41 denote the weighting factor for the perimeter regularization .",
    "then , we arrive at the following shape optimization problem for the functional with additional perimeter regularization : @xmath42 subject to @xmath43 and @xmath44 fulfilling    [ introstateequsharp ] @xmath45    here , we used the relation to replace the perimeter of @xmath8 with @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , by the polar decomposition @xmath47 of the radon measure @xmath37 into a positive measure @xmath48 and a @xmath49-valued function @xmath50 , see for instance ( * ? ? ? * corollary 1.29 ) , we replace the product of the normal and the hausdorff measure in by @xmath51 . in particular , @xmath52 can be considered as a generalised unit normal on @xmath53 .",
    "we remark that the shape optimization problem for the hydrodynamic force component have been studied extensively in the literature . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "the boundary integral is transformed into a volume integral .",
    "this is also done in @xcite , but in the latter , the compressible navier ",
    "stokes equations are considered .",
    "we also mention @xcite , which utilises the approach of borrvall and petersson @xcite and the volume integral formulation .",
    "the shape derivatives for general volume and boundary objective functionals in navier  stokes flow have been derived in @xcite .",

    "deriving optimality conditions is not easy and it is not clear how to perform numerical simulations on this problem .",

    "numerical simulations could be implemented by a moreau - yosida relaxation as in @xcite .",
    "a moreau - yosida relaxation also leads to a differentiable double well potential , and here we restrict ourselves to a differentiable potential where both settings can then be included in the above mentioned way .",
    "another possible modification of the problem setting would be to replace the equality constraint @xmath32 by an inequality constraint @xmath174 .",
    "this would make sense in certain settings , if a maximal amount of fluid that can be used during the optimization process is prescribed and not the exact volume fraction .",
    "this would not change anything in the analysis , only that the lagrange multiplier for this constraint would have a sign and an additional complementarity constraint appears in the optimality system .",
    "we may also consider objective functionals with no dependence on the normal , i.e. , the boundary objective functional takes the form @xmath175 an example of is the best approximation to a target surface pressure distribution in the sense of least squares : @xmath176 where @xmath177 denotes the target surface pressure distribution .",
