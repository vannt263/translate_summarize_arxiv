    "the spin structure of the pomeron is still an unresolved question in the diffractive scattering of polarized particles .",
    "there have been many observations of spin effects at high energies and at fixed momentum transfers @xcite ; several attempts to extract the spin - flip amplitude from the experimental data show that the ratio of spin - flip to spin - nonflip amplitudes can be non - negligible and may be independent of energy @xcite . in all of these cases ,",
    "the pomeron exchange is expected to contribute the observed spin effects at some level .",
    "the large rapidity events that are observed at cern @xcite and desy @xcite , and all diffractive and elastic high energy reactions are predominated by pomeron exchange , thus making the pomeron a popular field of study .",
    "extensive polarized physics programs are proposed at hera , rhic and lhc ( see _ e.g._@xcite ) in order to shed light on these and other spin effects in hadron reactions .",
    "it is generally believed , based on calculations of the simplest qcd diagrams , that the spin effects diminish as inverse power of center - of - mass energy , and that the pomeron exchange does not lead to appreciable spin effects in the diffraction region at super - high energies .",
    "complete calculations of the full set of helicity scattering amplitudes in diffraction region can not be carried out presently since they require extensive treatment of confinement and contributions from many diagrams .",
    "semi - phenomenological models , however , have been developed with parameters which are expected to be fixed with the aid of data from experiments @xcite .",
    "vacuum @xmath2-channel amplitude is usually associated with two - gluon exchange in qcd @xcite .",
    "the properties of the spinless pomeron were analyzed on the basis of a qcd model , by taking into account the non - perturbative properties of the theory @xcite .",
    "we refer to this as the standard - pomeron model in this paper .",
    "some models predict non - zero spin effects as @xmath3 and @xmath4 limit . in these studies ,",
    "the spin - flip amplitudes which lead to weakly altered spin effects with increasing energy are connected with the structure of hadrons and their interactions at large distances @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , the spin - dependence of the pomeron term is constructed to model rotation of matter inside the proton .",
    "this approach is based on chou and yang s concept of hadronic current density @xcite . the model developed in reference @xcite considers the contribution of a sea quark - antiquark pair to hadron interactions at large distances .",
    "this picture can be related with the spin effects determined by higher - order @xmath5 contributions in the framework of pqcd .",
    "really , it has been shown in the framework of qcd analysis at fixed momentum transfer that these corrections to the simple two - gluon exchange @xcite may lead to the spin - flip amplitude growing as @xmath6 in the limit of @xmath7 .",
    "the similar effects can be determined by the quark loops contributions @xcite    the high energy two - particle amplitude determined by pomeron exchange can be written in the form : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is a function caused by the pomeron , with a weak energy dependence @xmath10 ; and @xmath11 are the pomeron - hadron vertices .",
    "the perturbative calculation of the pomeron coupling structure is rather difficult and the non - perturbative contributions are important for momentum transfers of a few @xmath12 .",
    "the calculation of eq.([tpom ] ) in the non - perturbative two - gluon exchange model @xcite and in the bfkl model @xcite shows that the pomeron couplings have the following simple form : @xmath13 in this case , the pomeron contribution leads to a weak energy dependence of the differential cross section with parallel and antiparallel spins , and their difference drops as inverse power of @xmath6 , leading us to conclude that the spin effects are suppressed as a power of @xmath6 .",
    "this situation changes dramatically when large - distance loop contributions are considered which lead to a more complicated spin structure of the pomeron coupling .",
    "as mentioned above , these effects can be determined by the hadron wave function for the pomeron - hadron couplings , or by the gluon - loop corrections for the quark - pomeron coupling @xcite . as a result ,",
    "spin asymmetries appear that have weak energy dependence as @xmath3 .",
    "additional spin - flip contributions to the quark - pomeron vertex may also have their origins in instantons , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .    in the framework of the perturbative qcd",
    ", the analyzing power of hadron - hadron scattering was shown to be of the order : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is about a hadron mass @xcite .",
    "hence , one would expect a large analyzing power for moderate @xmath16 where the spin - flip amplitudes are expected to be important for the diffractive processes .",
    "in this paper , we examine the spin - dependent contribution of pomeron to the differential cross sections with parallel and antiparallel spins , their possible magnitudes and energy dependence .",
    "we also estimate the possible experimental precisions for these observables in the rhic energy domain .",
    "we use the standard helicity representation for the hadron - hadron scattering amplitudes : @xmath17 and @xmath18 , helicity nonflip amplitudes ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 , double - flip amplitudes ; and @xmath21 , single - flip amplitude .",
    "we assume , as usual , that at high energies the double - flip amplitudes are small with respect to the spin - nonflip one , @xmath22 and that spin - nonflip amplitudes are approximately equal , @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , the observables are determined by two amplitudes : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these customary assumptions are also made for the models developed in @xcite .",
    "we use the below normalization for the differential cross section : @xmath26 and the analyzing power and the double spin correlation parameters are : @xmath27,\\ ] ] @xmath28    the measured spin - dependent differential cross sections can be written in the form : @xmath29 , \\\\",

    "the meson - cloud @xcite and the rotating matter current @xcite models quantitatively describe the experimental data on elastic @xmath0 scattering at fixed momentum transfers and can predict physical observables ( cross sections and asymmetries ) at high energies .",
    "the predictions , however , differ in size and sign for asymmetries .",
    "we calculate the spin - dependent cross sections using the above described amplitudes in eq.([fpmr ] ) , and we use the parameters of the rhic beams @xcite for the estimation of statistical errors .",
    "we assume at @xmath63 , the luminosity is @xmath64 @xmath65 sec@xmath66 and the average beam polarization per beam is @xmath67 .",

    "the local dispersion relations have been used in @xcite to determine the real - part of @xmath74 .",
    "the model amplitude obeys the @xmath75 crossing symmetry which permits us to describe quantitativaly all the specific effects in the elastic proton - proton and proton - antiproton diffraction scattering in the wide energy region ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "for example , model discribe the difference of the differential cross sections for proton - proton and proton - antiproton scattering in domain of the diffraction minimum , the known polarization phenomena at @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the experimental data of proton - antiproton scattering at @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "all there quantities are sensitive to the real part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "so , we can believe that @xmath81 $ ] determined correctly and practically model - independent .",
    "the differential cross section calculations are shown in fig .",
    "1 a , b . the estimated errors are statistical and are less than @xmath82 . at @xmath83 , the model described here quantitatively",
    "reproduces the isr data @xcite .",
    "the diffraction minimum defined by the zero of the imaginary part of the spin - nonflip amplitude is filled by the contributions of the real - part of spin - nonflip and spin - flip amplitudes . at @xmath84 ,",
    "the dip becomes a @xmath85 and increases by an order of magnitude when the energy goes from @xmath84 to @xmath86 .",
    "the model gives the same asymptotical predictions for the proton - proton and proton - antiproton differential cross sections .",
    "hence the cross section prediction at @xmath87 approximately corresponds to the @xmath88 data at @xmath89 .",
    "fig.2 a , b show calculations for @xmath42 as determined in eq.([ann ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that the shape of @xmath42 is similar to the spin - averaged differential cross sections .",
    "it has a sharp dip and the magnitude of @xmath42 at the dip grows by an order of magnitude in the energy interval @xmath90 .",
    "although the dip positions for differential cross sections and that of @xmath42 seem to coincide at @xmath83 but at higher energies they move apart from each other since the dip of @xmath42 moves more slowly .",
    "the position of the @xmath42 minimum strongly depends on the model parameters .",
    "however , in the ranges of @xmath91 to @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the results weakly depend on these parameters . in the regions",
    "far from the dips , both cross sections change slowly , especially at @xmath94 .    the energy dependence of @xmath24 and @xmath95 amplitudes are determined in eq.([fpm ] ) for the @xmath96 vertex .",
    "hence , we have the same energy dependence for @xmath42 and @xmath97 for the spin - pomeron models , and the ratio of these quantities will be almost energy independent , except around the diffraction minimum .",
    "the calculated ratio of the spin - parallel and antiparallel cross sections , @xmath98 , shows only a logarithmic dependence on energy in its first maximum and is almost energy independent at @xmath99 , see ( fig .",
    "3 a , b ) . it is clear from these results that the spin effects can be sufficiently large at all rhic energies .",
    "relative errors in @xmath100 are shown in table i at two selected momentum transfers and at @xmath101 where the first maximum of @xmath102 is observed .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the errors with the growth of energy decrease due to increase in the differential cross sections .",
    "also note that in all standard pomeron models this ratio is predicted to be @xmath103 however , the experiment data show a large deviation from unity @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that at low - energies ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) @xcite , @xmath100 does not change much with energy at @xmath106 and is similar to our predictions of @xmath100 at the first maximum .",
    "our calculation for @xmath37 is shown in fig .",
    "4 a , b . the magnitude and the energy dependence of this parameter depend on the energy behavior of the zeros of the imaginary - part of spin - flip amplitude and the real - part of spin - nonflip amplitude .",
    "the maximum negative values of @xmath37 coincide closely with the diffraction minimum ( see figs . 1 and 4 ) .",
    "we find that the contribution of the spin - flip to the differential cross sections is much less than the contribution of the spin - nonflip amplitude in the examined region of momentum transfers from these figures .",
    "@xmath37 is determined in the domain of the diffraction dip by the ratio @xmath107 the size of the analyzing power changes from @xmath108 to @xmath109 at @xmath83 up to @xmath110 at @xmath111 .",
    "these numbers give the magnitude of the ratio eq.([ir ] ) that does not strongly depend on the phase between the spin - flip and spin - nonflip amplitudes .",
    "this picture implies that the diffraction minimum is filled mostly by the real - part of the spin - nonflip amplitude and that the imaginary - part of the spin - flip amplitude increases in this domain as well .",
    "we observe that the dips are different in speed of displacements with energy from figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "in fig . 4 , one sees that at larger momentum transfers , @xmath112 to @xmath113 , the analyzing power depends on energy very weakly .",
    "the expected errors for the analyzing power are small in nearly all momentum transfer ranges examined .",
    "they are summarized in table ii .    as pointed out before",
    ", the model @xcite predicts a similar absolute value but opposite sign for @xmath49 near the diffraction minimum .",
    "the future @xmath114 experiment at rhic @xcite should be able to provide data and help resolve these issues on the mechanism of spin - effect generation at the pomeron - proton vertex .",
    "in the framework of the standard - pomeron model , the spin - flip amplitude is defined only by the secondary regge poles and the ratio @xmath115/ \\sigma(^{\\uparrow \\downarrow } ) \\propto 1/s\\ ] ] that rapidly decreases with growing @xmath6 due to the standard energy dependence of the spin - flip amplitude .",
    "if we drop the asymptotic term in the spin - flip amplitude from eq.([fpmr ] ) and keep only the second regge terms that fall as @xmath116 , we obtain the pre - asymptotic regge contributions to the analyzing power and the difference of the polarized cross sections ( the results are shown in fig . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the spin - flip amplitude of the second regge contributions has a large relative phase compared to the spin - nonflip amplitude of the pomeron . under this condition , too , the analyzing power can be large . as one observes from fig . 5 , the spin - flip amplitude defined by the regge contributions can describe the experimental data at @xmath117 and give large effects at @xmath83 . at higher energies",
    ", however , the effect quickly falls and becomes insignificant .",
    "note that at @xmath118 , @xmath37 can be positive and that its magnitude greatly depends on the size of the asymptotic term which gives a negative contribution to the analyzing power .",
    "if the spin - flip amplitude is determined by the standard - pomeron model , its contribution will be clearly seen in experiments ( see figs 5 , 6 ) if performed . in this case , the minimum in @xmath42 is at small momentum transfers @xmath119 , and is quickly shifted with growing energy . in the ordinary dip region , there is a maximum in the difference of the cross sections which falls as the inverse power of energy .",
    "moreover , at @xmath120 , in the spin - pomeron model , @xmath31 and @xmath42 do not appreciably change with energy at fixed @xmath2 ( figs .",
    "the difference spin - dependent cross sections fall with energy as quickly as the increasing momentum transfers ( fig .",
    "6 ) .    the energy dependence of cross sections @xmath121 and @xmath122 can be studied experimentally at rhic .",
    "note that significant spin effects can have small relative errors at momentum transfers @xmath112 to @xmath123 and direct information about the nature of the spin - flip effects in the pomeron - proton coupling can be obtained .",
    "the future @xmath114 experiment at rhic should be able to measure the spin - dependent cross section with parallel @xmath121 and antiparallel @xmath122 beam polarizations in proton - proton scattering and the energy dependence of the spin - flip and spin - nonflip amplitudes can be studied in the energy range of rhic , @xmath124 .",
    "the spin - structure of the pomeron couplings are determined by the large - distance gluon - loop correction or by the effects of hadron wave function .",
    "tests of the spin structure of qcd at large distances can be carried out in diffractive reactions in future polarized experiments at hera , rhic and lhc .",
