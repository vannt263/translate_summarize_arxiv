    "in many real chemical and physical systems the observed distribution of the components is not that expected by statistical mechanics for a system at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "this can occur in the absence of mechanical forces driving the system away from equilibrium .",
    "many compounds exist as more than one polymorph at standard room temperature and pressure , despite one polymorph having a significantly lower free energy than the others .",
    "fluids can be cooled below the temperature at which thermodynamics predicts that a solid phase would be thermodynamically more stable @xcite .",
    "some components exist in different abundance than that predicted thermodynamically .",
    "these situations sometimes persist for timescales that are longer than human measurement allows or even for geological timescales .",
    "this behaviour might simply occur due to a slow transformation to the more stable state , or extreme rarity of necessary nucleating events might mean that the system is trapped in some nonergodic state for timescales that are incredibly long .",
    "systems in these states are often considered as being in ` metastable ' states , although it is perhaps inappropriate terminology for a polymorph like diamond ( an allotrope of carbon that has higher free energy than graphite ) which would normally be considered quite stable .",
    "such systems are also often described as being in ` nonequilibrium states ' , but they are nondissipative and no mechanical force is applied to prevent relaxation to the equilibrium distribution . to simplify terminology",
    "we will refer to these _ history dependent , non - dissipative , nonergodic , time independent nonequilibrium states _ as _ quasiequilibrium _ states .    in the past",
    "it has often been assumed that subsets of the components will be equilibrated , and their relative distributions will be given by equilibrium , boltzmann distributions .",
    "such ideas have been exploited in the so called energy landscape picture of the glass transition @xcite .",
    "it has also been assumed that equilibrium thermodynamics can be applied to these systems , which requires that the phase space domains of the subsets do not change with small changes in the state point .",
    "quasiequilibrium states can be formed in various ways - _ e.g. _ by temperature quenching , changing the potential energy function or changing the pressure of a system so rapidly that the system is not given sufficient time to adjust to the new conditions and the inter - domain weights can therefore not be expected to be boltzmann .",
    "if the barrier for transformation between two or more local minima is high , the non - equilibrium distribution between the phase space domains will persist .",
    "the relative distribution between the domains will depend on the way they are prepared and will therefore not be a boltzmann distribution .",
    "nevertheless , once trapped , there is ample time for the subsystems to become equilibrated within their restricted phase space subdomains .",
    "williams and evans @xcite produced convincing arguments that within these individual ergodic phase space sub - domains the internal distribution of states is given by a maxwell - boltzmann distribution and , using the fluctuation theorem as a sensitive test of aspects of the domain statistics , they confirmed that in aged glasses that are not too close to the glass transition , the intra - domain statistics are boltzmann and the domains are robust with respect to small but finite changes in the external thermodynamic state variables ( temperature , pressure etc . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting example of a quasiequilibrium system is a glass . when a good glass former is prepared , it is not able to relax to true thermodynamic equilibrium for an extraordinarily long time , often many thousands of years and in the case of the natural glass obsidian , some hundred million years .",
    "the system remains in a very long lived , history dependent , quasiequilibrium state .",
    "nevertheless , from a macroscopic point of view , the material appears to be an ordinary equilibrium solid .",
    "the fundamental thermodynamics and statistical mechanics of glass is a topic of active research .",
    "here we consider a simple model that could be used to represent a glass . unlike some solids ( e.g. allotropes of carbon ) , glasses have a structure which resembles that of a liquid . because of the numerous long lived structures it is necessary to examine the distribution of states within the glassy system .",
    "however , the model presented below might also be considered to represent many other systems e.g. a protein might be frozen into a particular conformation , and we might be interested in the free energy of this conformation compared to the overall free energy .    in recent years the equality for determination of free energy differences introduced by jarzynski @xcite has received considerable attention .",
    "this remarkable equality allows the difference in free energy between two states in thermodynamic equilibrium to be computed from an ensemble of nonequilibrium trajectories or pathways , of finite duration , which transform between the two equilibrium states .",
    "it is an interesting question as to whether this equality can shed light on a system which is quenched into a glassy state .",
    "it would also be interesting if this equality could be used to compute the difference in free energy of two polymorphs of the same compound , or to find the coexistence point in a phase transition .",
    "we investigate how the jarzynski equality can be extended to treat these systems .",
    "since the jarzynski equality relates the free energies of different canonical states at the same temperature , we consider the formation of a glass by changing the potential energy surface of the system while keeping temperature constant .",
    "this models the formation of glassy systems by , say , altering the molecular interactions by changing the ph , or increasing the mole fraction of free polymer in a dispersion to form a glassy colloidal system @xcite .",
    "here we will outline a very general approach that can be applied to arbitrary ensembles and dynamics ( deterministic or stochastic ) @xcite .",
    "it can be used to obtain the jarzynski equality ( je ) under particular conditions , but is more general and will be useful in the study of the quasiequilibrium states in the next section . consider two closed n - particle systems : ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) with arbitrary _ equilibrium _ distribution functions . a protocol and the corresponding time - dependent equations of motion",

    "( [ je ] ) , we are able to compute the difference in free energy between the equilibrium states for @xmath185 and @xmath186 . of course , for the simple model under consideration , the difference in free energy may be readily computed using eqs .",

    "this strong agreement with the equilibrium value in both cases gives a clear demonstration of how the jarzynski equality gives the free energy difference between the two equilibrated states .",
    "this might seem surprising .",
    "despite the fact that the period over which the work is measured is too short to generate the final equilibrium state , the jarzynski equality refers to the state that _ would _ be reached after infinite relaxation time .",
    "therefore , although there may be a long - lasting glass state , the jarzynski equality does not refer to that .",
    "provided ergodic consistency is satisfied , the jarzynski equality gives the difference between the initial equilibrium free energy and the free energy of the final equilibrium state .",
    "however , if there are phase space domains in the final state that are _ not sampled at all , _",
    "the jarzynski equality gives the free energy difference between the two _ equilibrium _ states subject to the constraint that the weights are zero in the excluded domains .",
    "the proof follows from a simple gedanken experiment .",
    "suppose that the reason why those excluded domains are not sampled at all is that the potential energy is actually infinite for all states in those excluded domains .",
    "then clearly the jarzynski equality gives the free energy difference between the two equilibrium states defined using the modified potential energy function for the final system . in this final equilibrium system",

    "the relaxation of the fluid is so slow that the crystalline states are never reached and rather the glass remains in a history dependent state for time scales beyond human experience . applying the jarzynski equality to glass forming systems where all crystalline phases are never sampled , gives the free energy difference between the initial equilibrium system and the `` ideal '' or equilibrium glass where the weights of all the glassy phases are boltzmann - both intra and inter domain weights .",
    "if the time over which @xmath184 varied was infinitely slow , the system would be quasistatic and the process would be thermodynamically reversible .",
    "the amount of work , eq .",
    "( [ work ] ) , done by every trajectory would then be the same and equal to the change in helmholtz free energy and the instant the process finishes the system would be in equilibrium .",
    "however in the final state , when @xmath184 is high , our system is not ergodic on the time scale of our simulations . by ergodic",
    "we mean that a single trajectory is able to sample a sufficient representation of phase space to be accurately representative of the entire phase space .",
    "recalling the measured distribution function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution - functions ] , this would require that @xmath184 does not change significantly during the time it takes a single trajectory to sample a sufficient representation of the two peaks seen in the figure . here",
    "the occurrence of a trajectory crossing from one peak to the other is a rare event and as @xmath184 is increased these events become much rarer .",
    "thus as @xmath184 increases , the minimal time scale on which the system may not change significantly , in order to obtain something representative of a quasistatic process , diverges .    as the process is not thermodynamically reversible it is interesting to consider the distribution functions for the work done by the trajectories at different times , fig .",
    "[ fig : work - distributions ] .",
    "the distributions are highly skewed towards large values of the work by trajectories where the particle remains trapped in the local minimum of the potential through the quench . by comparing the distribution of the more rapidly and slowly quenched ensembles , @xmath198 , and @xmath197 respectively , at the instant the quench finishes , @xmath195",
    ", we gain some insight as to how the jarzynski equality works for this process .",
    "the distribution for the slower quench is much sharper and less skewed , with only a single peak , due to the process being significantly closer to the quasistatic limit .",
    "thus during the slower quench many trajectories sample both the local minimum and the global minimum in the potential energy .",
    "in contrast to this , the more rapid quench is highly skewed with a second broad peak which can be observed at high values of @xmath211 .",
    "this is due to many of the trajectories becoming stuck in either the local or global minima for prolonged times during the quench , _",
    "i.e. _ loosely speaking , a break down in ergodicity . due to the form of the exponential average in eq .",
    "[ je ] the long skewed wing and broad second peak , for the more rapid quench , make only a small contribution to the average .",
    "this is exactly compensated for by the trajectories which remain trapped in the global minimum and have comparatively little work done on them , but make a large contribution to the average .",

    "the large difference between @xmath217 ( 1.7219 ) and @xmath115 ( 4.276 ) we find here shows how far the system is out of equilibrium at time @xmath198 by this measure .",

    "for each master point we calculate the average @xmath229 over the domain that each master point resides in .",
    "this is done by generating daughter points from their master .",
    "these daughter points are guaranteed to belong to the same domain as their master , because they are generated either by fixing the configuration from the master point and sampling the momenta from the appropriate maxwell - boltzmann distribution or by simply using the equations of motion to ergodically generate points in that same domain . in this monte - carlo like procedure for correctly averaging within and between domains",
    "we never need to know how many domains there are , or what their explicit weights are .",
    "the weights occur naturally and we know how to perform averages over each ergodic subdomain .    in the numerical work considered above ,",
    "a quench time of @xmath198 is sufficiently long that the numerical distribution is well approximated by the quasiequilibrium distribution when the quench is complete , and no additional relaxation time is required .",

    "in this paper we have considered a number of different states :            by studying a simple model we have shown that subject to the ergodic consistency condition , that by performing nonequilibrium path integrals , the jarzynski equality can be used to predict free energy differences between states that are either in thermodynamic equilibrium or constrained thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we have shown that subject to this condition this equality can even be used in systems where after the change protocol between the two states has completed , the final relaxation to the new equilibrium state is exceedingly slow .",
    "our example also confirms the correctness of a new statistical mechanical treatment@xcite of time independent , nonergodic , nondissipative nonequilibrium systems - so - called quasiequilibrium systems .",
    "we have also shown that in systems where certain phase space domains are totally unsampled in the final observed distribution of states ( @xmath236 ) , the jarzynski equality gives the free energy difference between the equilibrium states and the final constrained equilibrium state .",
