    "spectacular progress in cosmological observations in the last four decades has helped us to develop a standard model of the universe which is very successful . in this model ,",
    "the smooth universe is described by a _",
    "specific _ solution to the field equations of gravity , say , einstein s equations , and can be parameterized by a small set of numbers ( @xmath0 ... with their usual meanings ) .",
    "in addition , the formation of structures in the universe is described quite adequately in terms of the growth of perturbations around this smooth universe .",
    "these perturbations , generated during an inflationary phase , can be characterized by a power spectrum @xmath1 with two more parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . both theory and observations",
    "are mature enough today to test not only the lowest order predictions ( for e.g. , scale invariance of the perturbations , corresponding to @xmath4 ) , but also higher order effects ( like , for e.g. the deviation @xmath5 , in specific models ) .",
    "thus , on the whole , the description of the universe can be based on a set of well defined parameters which are directly observable .    at the next level of probing ,",
    "such a description encounters three kinds of difficulties , of which the first two are well - known in the literature and the third one will be the core topic of discussion in this article .    the first kind of difficulty is related to technical issues and details in the model .",
    "the following questions , for example , belong to this set : can we correctly describe the properties and statistics of dwarf galaxies ?",
    "do we understand the detailed mechanism which caused the reionization in the universe ?",
    "most cosmologists ( including me ) believe that it is just a question of time before we have satisfactory and consistent answers to such issues within the standard description .    the second kind of difficulty which arises in cosmology is related to the description of the matter sector .",
    "examples are questions like : what is the nature and abundance of the dark matter where @xmath6 . when the directly observed values of these two tensors @xmath7 and @xmath8 lead to @xmath9 , as it happens in our universe , einstein s theory appears to flunk the test .",
    "we can then either postulate a modified matter tensor @xmath10 , ( as done in the case of dark matter ) or a modification of theory by @xmath11 , ( as done in the case of dark energy which i take to be the cosmological constant ) .",
    "i will accept both these modifications , viz , the postulates of dark matter and the cosmological constant , in this article .",
    "one can question these assumptions , but again i find that all alternatives are much worse theoretically .",
    "] particle ?",
    "how can we explain the baryon - to - photon ratio in our universe ?",
    "these issues are more fundamental than the first kind of problems but most of us believe that we do have an algorithmic procedure available to attack these problems , _ within the framework of conventional cosmology_. for example , a successful extension of the standard model in high energy physics might allow us to compute such numbers from first principles .",
    "the current difficulty is then only due to our inadequate understanding of particle physics at high enough energies .",
    "the third kind of problems  which , as i said , we will be concerned with  are those which we have no clue as to how to address .",
    "the most important example in this category is the extremely tiny  but non - zero  value of the cosmological constant . as regards this set ,",
    "i am not so much concerned about the lack of a viable solution as with the fact that we do not even know how to properly attack these problems within the framework of conventional cosmology . in some cases , which i will discuss , it is not even clear how to precisely state these problems within the context of the standard model of cosmology .    after some clarifications on the notion of expansion of the universe ( sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) i will describe , in sections [ sec : allok ] to [ sec : timearrow ] , these foundational conundrums in cosmology . based on this discussion",
    ", i will argue ( see sec . [",
    "sec : altpara ] ) that it is fundamentally incorrect to describe the universe as a specific solution to the gravitational field equations .",
    "instead we should think of the universe a special system and look for a different paradigm to describe its evolution .",
    "i will suggest , towards the end of the article , some possible ingredients of such a paradigm and explain ( see sec . [",
    "sec : cosmin ] ) how it can solve the cosmological constant problem .",

    "the greek indices range over 1,2,3 while the latin indices range over 0 - 3 .",
    "the standard cosmological model is based on a specific solution to gravitational field equations .",
    "it is generally believed that one key feature of this solution is the ` expansion ' of the smooth background universe which is supposed to distinguish the friedmann solution from , say , the spacetime describing the region around the sun .",
    "what is not adequately emphasized is the fact that the standard notion of expansion depends on the coordinates you choose to describe the friedmann model .",
    "geodesic observers in a spacetime will interpret not only the friedmann metric but also the schwarzschild metric as ` expanding ' , while non - geodesic observers can find both of them non - expanding  in a precise sense , described below .",
    "this tells you that one need not associate the theoretical difficulties we will be discussing later too strongly with the notion of expansion . since this result , unfortunately ,",
    "has not attracted necessary attention in the literature and comes as a surprise even to some experts , i will introduce the friedmann model from a different perspective and highlight this fact .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the smooth , large scale , spatial 3-geometry of the universe should be homogeneous and isotropic and hence must have a constant 3-curvature which can be taken to be @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "i will confine my attention to models in which @xmath16 , so that the spatial sections are flat . , but not all . ]",
    "such a maximally symmetric 3-space should also necessarily be spherically symmetric about any given spatial origin .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to foliate the 3-space by 2-dimensional spherical surfaces with the metric @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a radial coordinate with a clear physical meaning : @xmath19^{1/2}$ ] with @xmath2 being the _ proper _ area of the foliating 2-surfaces .",
    "consider now a spacetime metric given by @xmath20 ^ 2 + r^2 d\\omega^2   \\label{frw1}\\ ] ] where the coordinates are chosen to be @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a specified function .",
    "this metric describes our universe with @xmath23 representing an effective equation of state for the matter with @xmath24 and @xmath25 interpreted as total pressure and total density ! if you compute the @xmath26 for this metric , you will find that it satisfies einstein s equations @xmath27 with a source energy momentum tensor @xmath28u^au_b+p(\\rho)\\delta^a_b$ ] where @xmath29 is the four - velocity of _ geodesic _ observers in the spacetime .",
    "this , in turn implies that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the projection tensor orthogonal to the four - velocity @xmath29 of the geodesic observers and @xmath32 is essentially determined by @xmath25 and the function @xmath33 .",
    "the line element in is remarkable in the sense that the spacetime geometry could be expressed directly in terms of the variables which occur in the matter sector of the theory through @xmath34 .",
    "that is , we have now solved the einstein s equations @xmath35 for the metric ; but this can be handled by a careful limiting procedure or in a different coordinate system .",
    "our universe is _ never _ described by a strictly @xmath36 equation of state .",
    "both during the inflationary phase as well as the late time acceleration , this equation of state is approached only asymptotically , and hence the line element is well - defined . ] and have expressed the components of the metric @xmath37 directly in terms of the components of the stress tensor @xmath34 .",
    "this is , of course , impossible to do in general but works in the case of the universe only because of its high level of symmetry .    to reduce the metric in into the conventional form is quite straightforward . given a function @xmath23 , compute the indefinite integral @xmath38 to obtain the function @xmath39 .",
    "invert this function , locally , to determine @xmath40 and thus @xmath41 , obtaining @xmath25 and @xmath24 as functions of @xmath42 .",
    "define , for convenience , the function @xmath43 through @xmath44 where the second equality follows from .",
    "transform from the coordinates @xmath45 to the coordinates",
    "@xmath46 and is a monotonic function of @xmath42 you can switch from @xmath25 to @xmath42 trivially ; if not , you can still do it locally and glue the definitions together appropriately .",

    "the metric as well as the field equation can be expressed entirely in terms of the function @xmath43 .",
    "but the function @xmath48 , _ defined _ through the first equation in , is not unique and has a scaling degree of freedom , @xmath53 .",
    "this is obvious when the metric is written as in because @xmath54 is invariant under constant rescaling of @xmath48 .",
    "this is not apparent if we start with the standard form of the friedmann metric in unless we also rescale @xmath49 .",
    "this is usually considered to be a rather trivial matter but it is not . equation ( [ eqn4.5 ] ) clearly shows that for a given @xmath43 determined by the source , the corresponding @xmath48 is _ not _ unique and is arbitrary with respect to a scaling by a constant . such a scaling freedom does _ not _ exist if we use the coordinates in or to describe the friedmann geometry .",
    "if we rescale @xmath55 , then the second equation in tells us that @xmath49 is _ automatically _ rescaled , leaving @xmath18 fixed .",
    "i stress that @xmath18 has a direct geometrical meaning @xmath56 in terms of the area of the @xmath57 constant , @xmath58 constant surface .",
    "so , the real origin of the scaling freedom in @xmath48 is from the fact that the geometrical description in or cares only for @xmath43 and that the @xmath48 arises through the definition in the first equation in .",
    "this , in turn , implies that we have the freedom to set @xmath59 for some value of @xmath42 while describing the universe .",
    "i will say more about this choice later on .    the line elements in or give us a very different pictures about the ` expansion of the universe ' , compared to the line element in .",
    "observers comoving with the coordinates @xmath46 or @xmath21  i.e. , observers with world lines having @xmath60 fixed  will find that the spatial cross - sections [ corresponding to @xmath57 constant or @xmath61 constant ] are described by _",
    "flat euclidean 3-space_. in particular , the volume enclosed by the @xmath58 constant surface in 3-space is just @xmath62 and the area of the @xmath58 constant surface is @xmath63 . neither the volume nor the area `` expands '' as time evolves in this coordinate system ! in contrast , observers using the coordinate system @xmath51 will find that the spatial cross - sections are euclidean 3-spaces scaled by an overall time dependent factor @xmath48 .",

    "both this volume and the area change with time and the universe `` expands '' in this coordinate system if @xmath48 is an increasing function of time .",
    "the above result demonstrates the title of this subsection .",
    "the observers with @xmath67 constant are",
    "geodesic observers and the clocks carried by them measure the cosmic time @xmath42 .",
    "these observers see the universe as expanding .",
    "the observers following the world line @xmath68 constant are _ not _ geodesic observers .",
    "when we use the metric in , the geodesics are described by the equation @xmath69 = \\text{constant }   \\label{eqn1.64}\\ ] ] since we like to think of galaxies to be in geodesic motion in our universe ( though no real galaxy follows the geodesic of the smooth friedmann model ) , it is useful to use coordinates in which each galaxy has a constant value of @xmath70 rather than a constant value of @xmath60 .",
    "this is merely a question of convenience and is not fundamental .",
    "the geometrical features of our universe ( like , e.g. redshift ) do not change under coordinate transformations , and we can indeed talk of all physical phenomena using the metric in without ever introducing the notion of an ` expanding ' universe .    in case",
    "you find this surprising , let me assure you that there is no swindle .",
    "the `` expansion '' of a spacetime defined in terms of the increase of , say , the proper areas of the surfaces with @xmath57 constant , @xmath58 constant , is _ always _ a coordinate dependent effect and can occur in _",
    "several _ spacetimes .",
    "consider , for example , the following metric : @xmath71^{2/3 } dx^2 + \\left [ \\frac{9gm}{2 } ( x + ct)^2 \\right]^{2/3 }   [ d\\theta^2+\\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2 ]    \\label{eqn7.52}\\ ] ] the proper area @xmath2 of the 2-surfaces with @xmath57 constant , @xmath64 constant , increases with time as @xmath72 ; similarly , the volume enclosed by the surface @xmath57 constant , @xmath64 constant , also increases with time .",
    "the observers using @xmath73 in the spacetime described by the metric in can claim  just like the observers using the coordinates in  that their spacetime is expanding .. you can define an expansion of this congruence by @xmath74 which appears to give a geometric , coordinate - independent , definition of expansion in the friedmann universe .",
    "this is true but @xmath75 will be non - zero for the geodesic congruence in most spacetimes , including the spacetime around the sun .",
    "if you introduce synchronous coordinates in which the metric is @xmath76 , then the geodesic velocity field is @xmath77 and @xmath78 $ ] will be non - zero in general . in the friedmann universe ,",
    "the maximal symmetry of space itself gives you a preferred timelike vector which coincides with the velocity vector of geodesic observers ; so @xmath75 is independent of @xmath79 , which will not happen in general .",
    "the definition of expansion still remains linked to a choice of observers in one way or another even when you use such  more geometric  ideas .",
    "] but the metric in describes the spacetime outside a spherical star like the sun ! instead of the standard schwarzschild coordinates , we are using the coordinates appropriate to freely falling observers @xcite . just as in the case of ,",
    "the time coordinate @xmath42 in denotes the proper time shown by the geodesic observers with trajectories @xmath80 constant .",
    "so , even a static spacetime can appear to be expanding when you use geodesic coordinates .",
    "the co - moving observers in the standard schwarzschild coordinates , of course , are non - geodesic observers just as the observers who use or .",
    "there is nothing sacred about geodesic observers and , in fact , we hardly use the coordinates adapted to geodesic observers anywhere in gr except in the case of cosmology .",
    "the reason i brought in the coordinate dependence of the notion of `` expanding '' universe is the following : as we proceed to discuss several conundrums in friedmann model , they may appear to be related to the fact that spatial sections of the universe are expanding .",
    "this , however , is incorrect .",
    "one can discuss all of cosmology including the big bang singularity , the inflationary phase etc . without this notion , by choosing a different set of coordinates .",
    "the metric will still be time dependent  through @xmath43 in and through @xmath33 in  but the spatial sections will be non - evolving euclidean 3-space .",
    "so it is conceptually inappropriate to attribute all the theoretical issues which we will come across to the fact that the universe is expanding .",
    "in general relativity , we think of the field equation @xmath35 as determining the metric tensor @xmath37 for a _ given _ source described by @xmath34 .",
    "we never ask where @xmath34 came from ; nor do we impose any constraints on the nature of @xmath34 except to demand that @xmath81 .",
    "this works quite well in all non - cosmological contexts like e.g. , when you want to determine the gravitational field around a binary pulsar or the gravitational field produced by a massive rotating black hole .",
    "you choose the appropriate @xmath34 , solve einstein s equation to get @xmath37 and then work out all the properties .",
    "this approach runs into a curious problem in the context of cosmology .",
    "if you use the standard friedmann coordinates in , then the energy momentum tensor should necessarily be of the form @xmath82 dia @xmath83 having two undetermined functions of time .",
    "the metric has one undetermined function @xmath43 and these _ three _ functions are related by _ two _ independent components of einstein s equations : @xmath84   \\label{eqn4.7}\\ ] ] this , in turn , tells you two things : first , the friedmann model of the universe is under - determined unless you externally specify a relation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 and put some conditions on what kind of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are acceptable .",
    "if you do nt ( and most modern cosmologists do nt ) you can have any evolutionary model of the universe described by any real function @xmath48 [ or @xmath43 ] by a suitable choice of the equation of state @xmath23 ! all you need to do is to choose your favourite model of evolution described by some @xmath48 [ which could give you a universe with any kind of features you like ] , compute @xmath86 and @xmath87 through and eliminate @xmath42 between these two variables to determine an equation of state @xmath23 for the material medium populating the universe . and @xmath24 will be the sum of densities and pressures of each species and , of course , each of them will have their own equation of state .",
    "but since total pressure @xmath87 and total density @xmath86 are just functions of time , you can eliminate @xmath42 between the two and determine an effective equation of state @xmath23 for an ` effective fluid ' which will produce the same geometry .",
    "you can also play the same game  as is often done in various disguises  using a scalar field with a potential @xmath88 .",
    "i have given an explicit recipe for constructing a @xmath88 for _ any _ @xmath48 in ref.@xcite .",
    "] the equation of state will be weird and fine - tuned but such models are routinely published in the literature .",
    "somewhat gratifyingly , @xmath86 given by will be positive definite but @xmath24 could have either sign .",
    "a source with @xmath89 would have been unthinkable some five decades back but today , negative pressure sources are not only considered acceptable but also respectable by the current generation of cosmologists .",
    "so you can publish a paper with any evolutionary history @xmath48 if you do not care for laboratory justification for the energy momentum tensor .",
    "_ cosmological evolution is , in principle , fundamentally unconstrained _ which is an issue we need to recognize .",
    "the situation is made worse by the following factors : if you start with an equation of state which _ is _ tested and justified in the laboratory , you will most probably have @xmath90 .",
    "when you evolve the universe backward in time , you will eventually reach energy scales which are not tested in the laboratory .",
    "this is going to happen irrespective of how high an energy scale you can explore in the laboratory .",
    "so , unless you discover in the lab , forms of matter with an equation of state which violates @xmath91 and/or @xmath92 , you are always going to hit an unknown domain .",
    "you can not do cosmology by specifying a lab - tested @xmath34 and solving for @xmath37 if ( i ) your lab - tested @xmath34 has @xmath93 and @xmath94 and ( ii ) you go sufficiently far into the past .",
    "this makes cosmology rather special from the point of view of solving einstein s equation .",
    "you _ need to _ postulate different forms of @xmath34 , work out the observational consequences and iterate on the procedure .",
    "unfortunately this never works out satisfactorily in practice .",
    "the near - infinite number of inflationary models available in the market is a simple proof that this procedure is unlikely to give you a predictive , unique description of the very early phases of the universe .",
    "there is also a deeper conceptual issue .",
    "it was known right from the early days of gr that the equation @xmath95 equates something extraordinarily beautiful on the left hand side to some ugly structure on the right hand side .",
    "this distinction gets worse as we start probing the earlier and earlier phases of the universe .",
    "for example , most of the scalar field potentials used in inflationary model building have no particle physics justification and are theoretically unacceptable from the point of view of quantum field theory  even as an effective field theory .",
    "add to it the fact that both matter and geometry has to `` come out of nothing '' at the beginning and you can see the knot we have tied ourselves in .",
    "this is the first of a series of questions i want to raise for which we not only do nt have a solution but  even worse  we do not even know how to approach the problem .",
    "this difficulty arises because _ the geometry does not constrain the matter sector sufficiently _ in standard gr but leaves us with far too many choices .",
    "observations are consistent with the idea that our universe can be described in terms of three distinct evolutionary phases : ( i ) an inflationary phase with an equation of state @xmath96 ; ( ii ) a radiation dominated phase with the equation of state @xmath97 followed by a matter dominated phase with @xmath98 .",
    "( iii ) a late time accelerated phase with the equation of state @xmath99 which i will take to be dominated by the cosmological constant .",
    "the standard way of describing the evolutionary history of such a model is through the equation @xmath100\\qquad ( a > a_{\\rm rh } ) \\end{cases }     \\label{eqn4.8}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the epoch of reheating at which the inflation ended .",
    "( i have assumed instant reheating and set @xmath16 for simplicity ) .",
    "such a description uses the constant parameters , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "( we usually set to @xmath106 but there is a subtlety about this choice which i will come back to ) .",
    "while these parameters are very convenient to compare observations with theory , they are completely unsuited for describing the universe as a physical system . for example , cosmologists living in a star system located in a galaxy at @xmath107 will use corresponding parameters evaluated at @xmath107 which , of course , will differ numerically from the ones we use .",
    "in other words , the parameters used in have no epoch invariant significance and are tied to a very special epoch at which the cmb temperature is 2.73 k. this is unsatisfactory when we want to think of the universe as a physical system described by certain cosmic constants .",
    "it is necessary to describe the evolution of the universe using constant parameters which will have epoch - independent significance .",
    "this is fairly easy to do and , in fact , one can do it in an infinite number of ways .",
    "one convenient set of parameters to use are the following : ( i ) we describe the inflationary phase by a constant density @xmath108 with the equation @xmath109 which will replace the first part of .",
    "( ii ) similarly , we introduce another constant density @xmath110 corresponding to the cosmological constant so that at very late times the universe will be described by the desitter expansion with @xmath111 .",
    "( iii ) to describe the radiation and matter dominated phase , it is convenient to introduce another _ constant _ density @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and the second equality defines the temperature @xmath114 .",
    "we can also introduce the parameter @xmath115 by the epoch - independent definition @xmath116 and work with the variable @xmath117 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn4.8 ] ) can now be rewritten in the form @xmath118",
    "\\end{cases }     \\label{eqn4.11}\\ ] ] in terms of the three densities @xmath119 .",
    "this is a much more meaningful way of describing our universe than by using the parameterization in .",
    "in particular , our cosmologist friend who lived in the @xmath107 galaxy would have written exactly the same equation with exactly the same numerical values , you will get three dimensionless numbers which will be the same as those used by the @xmath107 cosmologist .",
    "so it does not matter that we are using the cgs system which might not have existed at @xmath107 ! ] for @xmath119 .",
    "we could also convey to the @xmath107 cosmologist our normalization convention for @xmath48 : we tell her to set @xmath120 at the epoch when the cmb temperature was equal to @xmath114 ; this is again an invariant statement characterizing the description of our universe . or @xmath121 .",
    "these quantities remain constant , independent of the epoch @xmath55 at which they are measured , as the universe evolves .",
    "but their numerical value depends on the numerical value you attribute to @xmath105 which is not determined by theory .",
    "recall that einstein s equation only fixes @xmath43 and not @xmath48 .",
    "so while we know that @xmath122 , we will never know its numerical value without making an additional assumption .",
    "this is why it is convenient to use the scaling freedom and set @xmath123 at the epoch when the radiation temperature was equal to @xmath114 .",
    "this is a normalization which is independent of the current epoch and something with which our cosmologist at @xmath107 will agree . ] in other words , describes the universe as a physical system ( like , for e.g. an elastic solid ) determined by certain constants ( like , for e.g. the young s modulus etc . for a solid ) .",
    "obviously it is meaningful to ask why our universe has certain numerical values for @xmath119 in terms of , say , the planck density .",
    "from observations we know that : @xmath124 @xmath125 ^ 4     \\label{eqn4.13}\\ ] ] @xmath126 ^ 4     \\label{eqn4.14}\\ ] ] in natural units with @xmath127 .",
    "several comments are in order vis - a - vis these values .",
    "today we have no firm theory which determines the numerical values of any of these three densities .",
    "however , the _ nature _ of our ignorance about them differs significantly .",
    "the bound in could actually be replaced by a numerical value if future observations determine the energy scale of inflation .",
    "further , high energy physics does provide a glimmer of hope in eventually coming up with some sensible model of inflation which will determine the density in .",
    "consider next the numerical value of @xmath128 . from the definition",
    ", we can relate @xmath128 to the ratio between the number density of the photons and the number density of matter particles : @xmath129^{4 } \\label{heprhoeq}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 is a numerical constant , @xmath131 are the current number densities of dark matter particles , baryons and photons respectively and @xmath132 are the masses of the dark matter particle and baryon .",
    "we expect the physics at ( possibly ) guts scale to determine the ratios @xmath133 and @xmath134 and specify @xmath135 and @xmath136 . indeed , we have a framework to calculate these numbers in different models of high energy physics ( for a review , see e.g. , @xcite ) though none of these models can be considered as compelling at present .",
    "thus we do have a possible theoretical framework for determining @xmath108 and @xmath128 .",
    "but the situation is completely different as regards @xmath137 .",
    "we have no clue what determines the astonishingly small but non - zero numerical value of the cosmological constant characterized by the number ( in natural units with @xmath12 ) : @xmath138 the late time evolution of the universe is characterized by the cosmological constant @xmath139 , and the four constants ( @xmath140 ) describing nature thus lead to the dimensionless combination @xmath141 which is probably the smallest non - zero number relevant to physics !",
    "this issue is well - known and has often been thought of as _ the _ most fundamental problem in theoretical physics today .",
    "incidentally , there is another small number which has not acquired the notoriety it probably deserves .",
    "you can easily verify that : @xmath142 is also extraordinarily small .",
    "( this fact comes as a surprise many cosmologists ! ) how come cosmology literature is totally silent on the fine - tuning problem of @xmath128 but gives such a bad press to @xmath137 ?",
    "do you really believe that @xmath143 is _ not _ fine - tuning but @xmath144 is ?",
    "that would be a pretty ridiculous stand to take . when confronted with the smallness of @xmath145",
    "most people distinguish it conceptually from the smallness of @xmath146 by giving two arguments : ( a ) we _ do _ have a hope of determining @xmath145 from high energy physics through but we have no clue as to how to go about determining @xmath146 .",
    "( b ) it is more likely that @xmath139 has `` something to do '' with @xmath147 than with @xmath128 .",
    "these arguments may not sound very satisfactory but they do highlight the importance of the cosmological constant problem as something unique .",
    "so , our universe appears to be a hastily put together , make - shift job , using the three densities @xmath148 which _ have no relation to each other either conceptually or numerically_. the fact that you can build such an ad - hoc universe is closely related to the theoretical feature i mentioned in sec.[sec : allok ] .",
    "the current theoretical framework which uses _ only _",
    "einstein s equations is insufficient to constrain the matter sector . you can build universes with any set of three numbers ( @xmath148 ) and",
    "there is no theoretical principle constraining their values .",

    "our universe selects a preferred lorentz frame with respect to which you can measure the absolute velocity of your motion . in a few decades",
    "your car will be equipped with a gadget which will couple to the cmb , detect its dipole anisotropy and will tell you your velocity vector with respect to the absolute rest frame of the universe in which the cmb is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "operationally , to a limited extent , this is no different from the good old aether which was providing an absolute reference frame for defining the state of rest . in fact",
    ", the universe also provides you with an absolute _ time _ coordinate in terms of the cmb temperature .",
    "if you specify that you are using a coordinate system in which the cmb is homogeneous and isotropic and the cmb temperature is , say 30 k , you have uniquely specified your lorentz frame ( with the only residual symmetry allowed being that of spatial rotations and spatial translations . )    the field equation of gr , of course , is generally covariant and does not select out any coordinate system  and , in fact , it is invariant under a much larger group than just the lorentz group .",
    "a _ specific solution _ to this field equation need not possess the full symmetry of the equation , which is a rather trivial and well known fact . to obtain any specific solution , we need to specify @xmath34 which could bring in a natural coordinate system .",

    ". the rest of sr will follow .",
    "all this is interesting but does not create any problem .",
    "but the situation does have a deeper level of subtlety , which raises a conceptual issue .",
    "the real peculiarity is not the fact that our universe has a preferred lorentz frame ; _ it is the fact that we see no trace of this preference at sub - cosmic scale physics . _ to appreciate this issue , you have to recall that the smooth universe is an approximate entity and its description involves averaging the energy momentum tensor of actual clustered matter over sufficiently large scales . in arriving at the standard cosmological model , we _",
    "first _ average the matter distribution over sufficiently large scales , determine an average @xmath163 and _ then _ solve @xmath164 to obtain the friedmann metric @xmath165 .",

    ", you are expected to specify the matter energy momentum tensor at every event in the spacetime and then solve these differential equations .",
    "but you have no way of specifying the energy momentum tensor precisely at any given event where matter is present ! for example , suppose you want to determine the metric inside the sun .",
    "usually you define @xmath34 at an event inside the sun by treating the matter as a fluid ; this @xmath34 is an approximate @xmath34 obtained by averaging a more exact @xmath34 over a region large compared to the mean free path .",
    "if you probe matter at still smaller scales you will discover averaging at various scales all the way to , say , quarks and gluons .",
    "so , strictly speaking , we are _ always _ solving the equations @xmath164 .",
    "but suppose we had found the metric @xmath37 for the exact @xmath34 and averaged the metric over scales large compared to the mean free path etc .",
    "will such an average metric match with the solution of @xmath164 at appropriate length scales ?",
    "the entire gr works on the assumption that such an averaging _ is _ valid in spite of the non - linear nature of einstein s equations .",
    "if you do not assume this , you can not solve einstein s equations reliably in any region occupied by normal matter . ]    but what coordinate system should we use to solve the exact equation @xmath166 ?",
    "the validity of standard gr and general covariance at small scales imply that you could have used any coordinate system you like",
    ". if you then do the averaging , your final result will indeed be friedmann _ geometry _ but expressed in some strange coordinate system . to recover friedmann geometry in the standard",
    "friedmann coordinates , you should work with a sub - class of all possible coordinate systems while solving the exact equations @xmath166 and doing the averaging .",
    "in other words , if you want the exact metric , averaged over large scales , to exhibit the symmetries of the friedmann universe explicitly , then you need to restrict the general covariance at small scales . and the cosmological constant @xmath139 .",
    "if you express the metric in static , spherically symmetric coordinates and average the metric over scales large compared to the gravitational radius of @xmath168 , you will indeed recover desitter _ geometry _",
    "but in the static coordinates .",
    "you have to make a peculiar coordinate transformation of the schwarzschild - desitter geometry before averaging if the averaging has to reproduce the desitter universe in the standard friedmann coordinates . ]",
    "this shows that the existence of an absolute frame of rest at large scales actually selects out a class of coordinate systems with special properties at small scales .",
    "but we see no experimental evidence for such a selection at small scales . to the extent we can determine experimentally",
    ", there is no trace of an absolute rest frame or even a preferred class of frames in sub - cosmic level physics .",
    "the laboratory scale experiments looking for an absolute frame of rest ( without using the cmb ) have repeatedly drawn a blank , but wmap or planck has no difficulty in determining it using the cmb , even locally .",
    "roughly speaking , physics at cosmic scales breaks the general covariance ( and even lorentz invariance ) operationally by providing us with an absolute standard of rest ; but as we move to smaller and smaller scales , we are left with no trace of the cosmic frame of rest in any other phenomena , and the diffeomorphism invariance of equations holds .",
    "this enhancement of symmetry as we proceed to smaller scales is definitely a peculiarity of our universe which cries out for an explanation ; once again , we have no clue how to go about it .    in summary , the fact that the _ entire _ universe is filled by sources ( definitely the cmb , even if you ignore clustered matter ) which maintains the large scale homogeneity and isotropy is extremely peculiar .",
    "it is this substratum which allows us to define a cosmic rest frame , _ purely from observations_. you could certainly describe the friedmann geometry in any coordinate system you like and the physics will not change ; this is assured by the fact that general relativity respects general covariance .",
    "but it also remains a fact that observers can measure  and indeed they have measured  your absolute velocity with respect to a cosmic rest frame . in fact , paradoxical though it might seem , the friedmann model provides a _ generally covariant _ procedure for constructing an _ absolute _ frame of rest !",
    "i will now raise a question which , at the outset , may sound somewhat strange . _",
    "why does the universe expand and , thereby , give us an arrow of time ?",
    "_ to appreciate the significance of this question , recall that is invariant under time reversal @xmath169 .",
    "( after all , einstein s equations themselves are time reversal invariant . ) to match the observations , we have to choose a solution with @xmath170 at some fiducial time @xmath171 ( say , at the current epoch ) , thereby breaking the time - reversal invariance of the system .",
    "this , by itself , is not an issue for a laboratory system .",
    "we know that a particular solution to the dynamical equations describing the system need not respect all the symmetries of the equations .",
    "but , for the universe , this _ is _ indeed an issue .    to see why ,",
    "let us first discuss the case of @xmath172 for all @xmath42 .",
    "the _ choice _",
    "@xmath170 , at any instant of time , implies that we are _ postulating _ that the universe is expanding at that instant . then tells us that the universe will expand at all times in the past and will have a singularity ( @xmath173 ) at some finite time in the past ( which we can take to be @xmath174 without loss of generality ) .",
    "the structure of prevents us from specifying the initial conditions at @xmath174 .",
    "so , if you insist on specifying the _ initial _ conditions and integrating the equations forward in time , you are forced to take @xmath170 at some @xmath175 , thereby breaking the time reversal symmetry .",
    "the universe expands at present ` because ' we chose it to expand at some instant in the past .",
    "this expansion , in turn , gives us an arrow of time with either @xmath42 or @xmath55 can be used as a time coordinate .",
    "but why do we have to choose the solution with @xmath170 at some instant ? .",
    "this is the essence of the so called _ expansion problem _ @xcite .",
    "an alternative way of posing the same question is the following : how come a cosmological arrow of time emerges from equations of motion which are time - reversal invariant ?    in a laboratory , we can usually take another copy of the system we are studying and explore it with a time - reversed choice of initial conditions , because the time can be specified by degrees of freedom _ external _ to the system .",
    "we can not do it for the universe because we do not have extra copies of it handy and  equally importantly  there is nothing external to it to specify the time .",
    "so the problem , as described , is specific to cosmology .",
    "so far we assumed that @xmath172 , thereby leading to a singularity .",
    "since meaningful theories must be nonsingular , we certainly expect a future theory of gravity  possibly a model for quantum gravity  to eliminate the singularity [ effectively leading to @xmath176 .",
    "can such a theory solve the problem of the arrow of time ?",
    "this seems unlikely . to see this ,",
    "let us ask what kind of dynamics we would expect in such a ` final ' theory .",
    "the classical dynamics will certainly get modified at the planck epoch , but , away from it , we expect some effective equations ( possibly with quantum corrections ) to govern the evolution of an ( effective ) expansion factor .",
    "the solutions could , for example , have a contracting phase ( followed by a bounce ) or could start from a planck - size universe at @xmath177 , just to give two non - singular possibilities . while we do not know these equations or their solutions , we can be confident that they will still be time - reversal invariant because quantum theory , as we know it , is time - reversal invariant .",
    "so except through a choice for initial conditions ( now possibly at @xmath177 ) , we still can not explain how the cosmological arrow of time emerges . since quantum gravity is unlikely to produce an arrow of time , it is a worthwhile pursuit to try and understand this problem in the ( semi)classical context .",
    "hypersurface and let us assume that certain regions behave like ` local ' friedmann models with @xmath170 and other regions have @xmath178 so that no global arrow of time can be defined from the expansion .",
    "next , assume that the dynamics of these patches are independent of each other and we just happen to be in a patch with @xmath170 , thereby ` solving ' the problem .",
    "this scenario has several difficulties . for a generic initial condition ,",
    "the patches will _ not _ evolve independently in a nonlinear theory of gravity . even defining a ` local expansion factor ' for a ` local patch ' without assuming special symmetries",
    "is impossible .",
    "such scenarios are often invoked in the context of inflationary models but they do not have rigorous mathematical justification . ]",
    "given all these , it will be nice if we can find a simpler way by which the equations of motion that are time - reversal invariant can lead to an evolution which singles out an arrow of time . at first sight",
    "one might think this is impossible but one can manage to do it with unbounded hamiltonians .",
    "i will describe the idea with a simple example .",
    "consider an ` inverted ' oscillator @xmath179 obeying the equations of motion @xmath180 this equation is clearly invariant under @xmath169 so one would have thought that no arrow of time will emerge from the dynamics , unless we impose it in the initial conditions .",
    "the general solution is @xmath181 for a generic initial condition , there is no relationship between @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "so at late times ( i.e , @xmath184 ) , we find that one branch of the solution is selected out : @xmath185 leading to an  expansion \" and an arrow of time ! the solution in is time - reversal invariant in the sense that @xmath186 if we let @xmath187 when we do @xmath188 .",
    "but once we have chosen a generic solution with some uncorrelated @xmath182 and @xmath183 , the _ late time dynamics _ picks out an arrow of time correlating the increase of @xmath189 with the increase of @xmath42 .",
    "( of course , there are special initial conditions like e.g. , @xmath190 or @xmath191 for which this will not happen , but these are special choices and not generic . )    one can easily show that this behaviour arises for a wide class of hamiltonians that are unbounded .",
    "it is not necessary that the potential energy is unbounded .",
    "if the kinetic energy term has the ` wrong ' sign , so that the lagrangian has a form like @xmath192 with a @xmath193 which is positive and unbounded from above , say , we will again end up with an instability and the late time evolution of @xmath194 will give an arrow of time .",
    "interestingly enough , it was known for decades @xcite that the expansion factor @xmath48 does have such a wrong sign in the kinetic energy term in the hilbert action and hence represents an unstable mode .",
    "the above interpretation suggests that _ it is this cosmic instability which we call expansion , _ and for timescales larger than the planck time , it picks out an arrow of time . clearly , the same feature will occur even in any effective theory describing the ( semi)classical gravity once @xmath48 acquires an unstable dynamics .",
    "this is guaranteed to happen because any sensible quantum cosmological model will approach the friedmann model at times larger than the planck time and  in the friedmann limit  @xmath48 is an unstable model .",
    "this instability has relevance for another peculiarity related to the early , quantum regime of the universe which does not seem to have attracted the attention it deserves .",
    "it is generally believed that the very early phase of the universe needs to be described quantum mechanically using the principles of quantum gravity , because during these earliest moments , the length scale associated with the curvature will be comparable to the planck scale .",
    "this , however , raises a conundrum not encountered elsewhere in physics .",
    "_ how come the universe , which started out as a quantum mechanical system , became classical spontaneously as it evolved ? !",
    "_    to see this issue in proper context , you need to introduce some theoretical structure which can tell you the ` level of classicality ' of a system .",
    "many such definitions can be given , each suited for specific systems ( for a sample of ideas and references to previous work , see @xcite ) .",
    "most of them use the idea that a classical system follows a sharply peaked trajectory in _ phase space _ of the form @xmath195 while a quantum system will not exhibit correlations between @xmath194 and @xmath24 .",
    "you can choose any sensible descriptor of classicality and ask whether a quantum mechanical system can become classical spontaneously .",
    "just for illustration , consider the wigner function @xmath196 built from a wave function @xmath197 describing a quantum system evolving under the action of a hamiltonian @xmath198 .",
    "we would like to know what kind of hamiltonians will ensure that , as @xmath199 , the wigner function gets sharply peaked on a classical trajectory in the phase space .",
    "the answer is surprising : if the hamiltonian is bounded , then the system can not evolve spontaneously to classical behaviour .",
    "in other words , if you want to start with a quantum universe and ensure that the evolution takes it to a classical universe , the effective hamiltonian describing such an evolution can not be bounded ; rather , it should exhibit an instability from a conventional point of view .",
    "as i said before , many of the toy hamiltonians describing the reduced phase space of gravity do have one degree of freedom  precisely the one corresponding to the expansion factor @xmath48  which comes up with a wrong sign for the kinetic energy .",
    "the above result tells you that the wrong sign is indeed the right sign if the universe has to become classical on its own .",
    "this result is very special to cosmology .",
    "hamiltonians with negative kinetic energy terms are taboo in laboratory scale physics for good reasons ; you do not want run - away situations in the lab .",
    "but one can easily accommodate such an instability in the behavior of the universe .",
    "_ the cosmic expansion itself is just a run - away solution fed by the instability .",
    "_ this fact also ties up two concepts : ( i ) the origin of the cosmic arrow of time and ( ii ) the spontaneous quantum to classical transition made by the universe during its evolution .",
    "normal systems in the lab do not spontaneously evolve into a more and more classical state as time evolves .",
    "but this is precisely what systems with unbounded hamiltonians do .",
    "for example , the inverted harmonic oscillator in , treated as a quantum system , does become more and more classical as it evolves .",
    "a more general description of this results is as follows : decompose the spatial 3-metric in the form @xmath200 with @xmath201 as a gauge condition . then , using the form of the einstein - hilbert lagrangian , one can show that while the kinetic energy term for @xmath48 has the wrong sign , the other degrees of freedom , represented by @xmath202 , have the correct sign . in other words , it is only the overall scale factor of the 3-metric which has an instability .",
    "hence it is this degree of freedom which turns classical first during the evolution .",
    "if these features are preserved in the effective quantum - corrected description of gravity , then we can hope to have an explanation for a broader question : why is the classical universe described by a single dynamical degree of freedom @xmath48 , rather than by , say a bianchi type - i model with three degrees of freedom ?",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained so far with regards to this question are limited to simple toy models .",
    "there is no assurance that they will hold in a more general context of quantum gravity .",
    "but if they do , it tells you that the quantum gravitational description of spacetime should contain the seeds for an instability which is rather unexpected .",
    "the standard models for high energy physics and many candidate models of quantum gravity shy away from working with unbounded hamiltonians because they are mathematical nightmares .",
    "what is more , this instability does nt seem to do much at smaller scales in the universe : we do not see spontaneous nucleation of mini - universes all over space today .",
    "it is difficult to embed a quantum cosmological model within the broader context of quantum gravity such that everything will work out fine for the large scale universe but physics at smaller scales will not have any unwanted instabilities . once again , it appears that the universe is a rather special system and not just a specific solution to a certain more general gravitational theory .",
    "let me summarize the discussion so far before proceeding further : the conventional approach to cosmology , which describes the universe using a specific solution to the gravitational field equations , leads to the following issues :    1 .",
    "einstein s equation , in general , does not put any constraint on @xmath34 except requiring @xmath81 . in the context of cosmology , this allows you to accommodate any evolutionary history for the universe with a suitable choice for the equation @xmath22 .",
    "the fact that we will be able to probe the matter sector only up to a finite energy scale in the lab at any given time , while the energy scale close to the big bang can be arbitrarily high ( if @xmath203 ) , makes the early evolution of the universe under - determined both in principle and in practice .",
    "observations suggest that the evolution of our universe is well approximated by the differential equation containing three constant parameters @xmath148 with two  apparently unconnected  epochs of accelerated expansion .",
    "these three parameters , which constitute the signature of our universe , do not seem to have any conceptual or numerical relationship .",
    "in other words , our universe is built using three unrelated , ad - hoc numbers .",
    "it is possible to construct a rather strange combination of these three densities and define a quantity @xmath149 ( see ) which has the numerical value @xmath154 to the precision of 1 part in 1000 .",
    "this ( four ) `` pi in the sky '' demands an explanation , which is difficult to conceive of within the context of the conventional approach because the matter sector is completely unconstrained .",
    "( `` everything is allowed in cosmology . '' ) 4 .",
    "the cosmos , at very large scales , provides us with an absolute frame of rest ( in which the cmb is isotropic ) and an absolute time coordinate ( in the form of the temperature of the cmb ) .",
    "you can measure your absolute motion using the dipole anisotropy of the cmb , which acts like a cosmic aether .",
    "however , we see no experimental trace of the existence of such an absolute standard of rest at sub - cosmic scales ( if we do not use the cmb ) . in other words , sub - cosmic scale physics appears to be invariant under a much larger group ( viz .",
    ", the general coordinate transformation group ) than the very large scales which define a cosmic aether and a preferred coordinate system .",
    "this enhancement of symmetry at small scales vis - a - vis the largest scales is intriguing .",
    "cosmic evolution introduces an arrow of time even though einstein s equations , like the rest of physics , are invariant under time reversal .",
    "( this arrow of time arises through dynamics rather than through statistical coarse graining etc . )",
    "while the unstable mode , corresponding to the expansion factor @xmath48 , might have something to do with this , the details are still uncertain . in particular",
    ", this explanation requires the effective hamiltonian describing the cosmos to be unbounded ; it is not clear how such a feature could be embedded in a quantum gravitational model without affecting small scale physics .",
    "once again , we see a conceptual tension between the description of sub - cosmic scale physics and the dynamics of the large scale universe .",
    "the universe is probably the only system known to us which made a spontaneous transition from quantum mechanical behaviour to classical behaviour  i.e , treated as a dynamical system , it became more and more classical as time went on .",
    "systems with bounded hamiltonians can not do this .",
    "this suggests a relation between spontaneous transition to classicality and the arrow of time , possibly again through the `` wrong sign '' for the kinetic energy associated with the expansion factor . while this could very well be the reason , the details remain to be worked out",
    "i believe the conundrums described above provide sufficient motivation to look for an alternative paradigm to describe the cosmos . in this last part",
    ", i will outline such a paradigm and how it addresses at least one of the crucial issues , viz . , the problem of the cosmological constant .",
    "the conventional approach begins by assuming the validity of gr to describe the evolution of spacetime and then obtain a specific solution to the field equation to describe the evolution of the large scale universe .",
    "there is , however , considerable evidence to suggest that the field equations of gravity themselves have only the conceptual status similar to the equations describing an elastic solid or a fluid ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . in the alternative perspective which emphasizes this feature , gravity is the thermodynamical limit of the statistical mechanics of the underlying spacetime degrees of freedom ( the ` atoms of space ' ) .",
    "the field equations are obtained from a thermodynamic variational principle which is similar to extremizing a thermodynamic potential to obtain the equilibrium state of the normal matter .",
    "the validity of the gr field equations then correspond to a maximum entropy configuration of the atoms of space .",
    "the evolution of spacetime itself can be described in a _",
    "purely thermodynamic language _ in terms of suitably defined degrees of freedom in the bulk and boundary of a 3-volume .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the evolution of geometry , interpreted as the heating and cooling of null surfaces , is described by the equation : @xmath204 where @xmath205 are the degrees of freedom in the surface @xmath206 and bulk @xmath207 of a 3-dimensional region and @xmath208 is the average davies - unruh temperature @xcite of the boundary .",

    "but if this is indeed the correct description of the , then the field equations of gr , representing some kind of thermodynamic equilibrium between matter and the , can not be universally valid .",

    "so what could be the additional ingredient we need to introduce into the standard gr ?",
    "_ i believe @xcite this has to do with the concept of information stored in the spacetime and its accessibility by different observers .",
    "_    a key feature of gravity is its ability to control the amount of information accessible to any given observer .",
    "a well - known example of this idea arises in the physics of black holes .",
    "more generally , the lack of access to spacetime regions leads to a configurational entropy related to the . over decades",
    ", we have come to realize @xcite that information is a physical entity and that anything which affects the flow and accessibility of information will have direct physical significance .",
    "one consequence of such a paradigm is that matter and geometry will be more closely tied together ( through the information content ) than in the conventional approach",
    ". you should not be able to build an ad - hoc universe with randomly chosen values for the three densities @xmath148 .",
    "_ we would expect , for example , a relationship connecting the late time accelerated expansion with the early inflationary phase through the information content of spacetime . _    it turns out that , by applying this idea to the cosmos in a specific manner , you can solve _ the _ deepest mystery about our universe , viz . , the small numerical value ( @xmath230 ) of the , @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath149 in measures ( in a way defined more precisely below ) the amount of information accessible to an eternal observer in our universe .",
    "if @xmath231 , such an observer can observe all of spacetime and can acquire an infinite amount of information .",
    "but when @xmath232 , the information accessible to the observer is finite and is related to @xmath137 through .",
    "so , if you have an independent way of fixing @xmath149 , then you can use to express @xmath137 in terms of the other two densities .",
    "the value of @xmath149 is fixed by the following fact : it turns out that , _ the spacetime becomes effectively 2-dimensional close to planck scales _ , irrespective of the dimension exhibited by the spacetime at large scales @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the basic unit of information stored in the  is given by @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the area of the 2-sphere with radius @xmath229 .",
    "this unit of quantum gravitational information is what appears in and allows us to determine the numerical value of the cosmological constant .",
    "let me now fill in some details of this result .",
    "let us begin by recalling how the existence of a non - zero  prevents an eternal observer @xmath235 ( i.e. , an observer whose world line extends to @xmath199 and who makes observations at very late times ) from acquiring information from the far reaches of our universe .",
    "let @xmath236 be the comoving distance traveled by light between the epochs @xmath237 and @xmath238 with @xmath239 in the standard friedmann model with expansion factor @xmath48 .",
    "this is given by : @xmath240 so the comoving [ @xmath241 and proper [ @xmath242 sizes of the regions of the universe at an epoch @xmath55 , from which @xmath235 can receive signals at very late times , are given by @xcite : @xmath243 the behaviour of @xmath244 and @xmath245 depend crucially on whether the  is zero or non - zero . if @xmath246 and the universe is dominated by , say , matter at late times , then @xmath247 , with @xmath248 at late times .",
    "then , both these integrals will diverge at the _ upper _ limit as @xmath199 , irrespective of the behaviour of the universe at earlier epochs .",
    "so , in a universe with @xmath246 , information from the infinite expanse of space will be accessible to the eternal observer at late times ; there is no blocking of information .    if @xmath249 and @xmath250 constant at late times , then the situation is different . in that case , both the integrals in are finite at the upper limit and an eternal observer have only access information from a _",
    "finite _ region of space at an epoch @xmath55 , irrespective of how long she waits .",
    "the amount of accessible cosmic information ( which i call `` cosmin '' ) is now reduced from an infinite amount to a finite value , say @xmath251 , as a _",
    "direct consequence _ of the fact that @xmath249 .",
    "_ it is , therefore , reasonable to expect that the numerical value of @xmath139 should be related to @xmath251 with @xmath251 decreasing with increasing @xmath139 .",
    "_ i will now derive this relation .",
    "consider a universe ( like ours ) with three distinct phases of evolution : ( i ) at very early times , the universe was in a state of inflation with @xmath252 constant .",
    "( ii ) at some point @xmath253 , the inflation ends ; the universe reheats and becomes radiation - dominated .",

    "the geometrical features related to @xmath244 and other relevant length scales are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthscales ] .",
    "the green curve is the _ comoving _ hubble radius @xmath260 .",
    "it decreases ( as @xmath261 ) during the inflationary phase , reaching a minimum at @xmath258 ; it then increases as @xmath262 in the radiation - dominated phase and as @xmath263 in the matter - dominated phase , attaining a maximum around @xmath264 ; in the @xmath139-dominated phase , it again decreases as @xmath261 .",
    "the red curve denotes @xmath244 obtained by evaluating the integral in and represents the visibility limit . during the @xmath139-dominated phase",

    " varying just by a factor 3 ( from @xmath267 at @xmath268 to @xmath269 at @xmath270 ) when @xmath55 varies by a factor @xmath271 . during the inflationary phase ,",
    "@xmath244 again tracks @xmath272 asymptotically , with an approximate behaviour @xmath273 + a_{\\rm rh}^2/a$ ] . as i mentioned , the region of space from which an eternal observer can acquire information is finite for all finite @xmath55 if the  is non - zero .",
    "our next task is to quantify the amount of cosmic information that is actually accessible to the eternal observer . to do this ,",
    "recall that a comoving scale @xmath274 constant is associated with a proper length scale @xmath275 . the proper length scales ( e.g.",
    ", the wavelengths of modes ) will get stretched exponentially during the inflation , and will exit the hubble radius .",
    "( one can think of @xmath276 as a physical length being stretched by expansion .",
    "you can equally well think of it as the proper length associated with a geodesic labeled by a comoving scale @xmath277 .",
    "i will use the former terminology since it is more familiar to cosmologists . ) after remaining outside the hubble radius for some time , some of them will re - enter the hubble radius during the matter / radiation dominated epoch .",
    "( two such modes are shown as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthscales ] . ) in contrast , the mode marked as ( 3 ) will leave the hubble radius but will _ never _ re - enter it .",
    "such modes cross not only the hubble radius but also the horizon ( red line ) and become invisible to the eternal observer at , say , the epoch of reheating @xmath270 .",
    "so the modes relevant to us are confined to those between the two dotted horizontal lines which are tangential to the hubble radius at its turning points . the total number of such modes ( or , equivalently , geodesics ) is a measure of the information content @xmath251 .    let us compute how many modes cross the hubble radius during the inflationary phase between @xmath278 and @xmath270 . since the desitter space is invariant under time translation , the _ rate _ at which the modes leave the hubble radius will be a constant .",
    "so the number of modes @xmath279 which cross the hubble radius during an interval @xmath280 will be proportional to @xmath281 .",
    "so the total number of modes which cross the hubble radius during the inflationary epoch will be proportional to @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is the relevant duration in the inflationary phase .",
    "( here @xmath284 denotes the number of e - foldings in the interval @xmath285 . ) therefore , the cosmin is given by : @xmath286 and all we need to do is to fix the proportionality constant using a suitable measure .",
    "this measure can be introduced as follows : the number of modes @xmath287 within the comoving hubble volume @xmath288 with wave numbers in the range @xmath289 is given by @xmath290 where @xmath291 .",
    "a mode with the comoving wave number @xmath292 will leave the hubble radius when @xmath293 .",
    "so the modes with wave numbers within the range ( @xmath294 ) , where @xmath295\\ , da$ ] , will exit the hubble radius in an interval ( @xmath296 ) . therefore , the number of modes that cross the hubble radius during the interval @xmath280 is given by @xmath297}{da } \\ , da = \\frac{2}{3\\pi}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{a_2 h_2}{a_1h_1}\\right)\\ ] ] ( this result , of course , is applicable for any @xmath48 ; not just in the inflationary phase . ) during inflation , when @xmath298 , this expression reduces to @xmath299 which tells us that the proportionality constant in is @xmath300 .",
    "we thus find the value of cosmin to be : @xmath301 we can relate the ratio @xmath302 to the three densities @xmath303 and @xmath108 which will give @xmath304 . to determine the proportionality constant , we need to evaluate the turning point of the @xmath305 curve near @xmath306 which requires solving a cubic equation . doing this ( for details , see @xcite ) , we find that the proportionality constant has the value @xmath307 .",
    "substituting into , we achieve our first goal , viz .",
    "relating the _ non - zero _ value of the  to the _ finite _ amount of cosmic information accessible to an eternal observer ( @xmath251 ) : @xmath308 as expected , the  vanishes when the information content is infinite ( @xmath309 ) and vice - versa .    equation  ( [ four ] ) will determine @xmath137 in terms of @xmath108 and @xmath128 provided we know the value of cosmin from some other physical consideration .",
    "( i share the hope that @xmath108 and @xmath128 will be eventually determined from high energy physics in terms of the inflationary model and the dark matter content of the universe . ) to do this , notice that the modes which exit the hubble radius during the inflationary epoch correspond to sub - planckian scales in the early part of inflation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lengthscales ] , the black line indicates the _ comoving _ length scale @xmath310 corresponding to the planck length @xmath229 .",
    "the region below this line corresponds to _ proper _ length scales smaller than the planck length , and will be dominated by quantum gravitational effects .",
    "the modes containing the cosmic information cross the comoving planck length during the earlier stages of evolution and hence carry the imprint of quantum gravitational effects .",
    "so we expect @xmath251 to be determined by quantum gravitational considerations .",
    "it can be shown that the spacetime becomes effectively two - dimensional near planck scales @xcite and hence the unit @xmath311 of quantum gravitational information content of spacetime is given by the degrees of freedom contained in a 2-sphere of radius @xmath229 , viz .",

    "let me conclude with a few comments on this result :    * the relation @xmath320 , also determines the relevant number of @xmath321-foldings in the inflationary epoch which carries the cosmic information .",

    "show that the cosmin indeed has a value @xmath154 to the precision of one part in a thousand ! _ because of the logarithmic dependence on the cosmic parameters in , this result is fairly stable and renders a purely observational support for the claim @xmath325 . *",
