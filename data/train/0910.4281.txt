    "an amorphous solid which is freshly produced by cooling a glass - forming system from high to low temperature is isotropic up to small statistical fluctuations .",
    "put under an external strain , its stress vs. strain curve should exhibit symmetry for positive or negative strains .",
    "this is not the case for the same amorphous solid after it had been already strained such that its stress exceeded its yield - stress where plastic deformations become numerous , resulting in an elasto - plastic flow state .",
    "the phenomenon is clearly exhibited in fig .  [ stress - strain ] .",
    "a typical averaged stress - strain curve for a 2-dimensional model amorphous solid ( see below for numerical details ) starting from an ensemble of freshly prepared homogenous states is shown in the left panel , with a symmetric trajectory for positive or negative shear strain . once in the steady flow state",
    ", each system in the ensemble is brought back to a zero - stress state , which serves as the starting point for a second experiment in which a positive and negative strain is put on the system as shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ stress - strain ] .",
    "even though the initial ensemble is prepared to have zero mean stress , the average trajectory now is asymmetric , with positive strain exhibiting ` strain hardening ' @xcite , but reaching the same level of steady state flow - stress , whereas , the negative strain results in a ` strain softening ' and a faster yield with eventually reaching the same value of steady - state flow - stress ( in absolute value ) .",
    "this simple phenomenon , sometime referred to as the bauschinger effect @xcite , shows that the starting point @xmath0 for the second experiment ( referred below as the bauschinger point ) retains a memory of the loading history , some form of anisotropy , which is the subject of this article .",
    "we stress that the issue under study is different from anisotropic elasticity which stems from , say , a lattice anisotropy of a crystalline solid . here",
    "the systems under study are amorphous , and nevertheless develop a strain induced anisotropy which is much more subtle to identify and quantify .    how to identify the order parameter which is responsible for the anisotropy underlying the bauschinger effect is a question that hovers in the elasto - plastic community for some while @xcite .",
    "one obvious concept , i.e. of ` back stress ' @xcite or ` remnant stress ' for explaining the asymmetry seen in the second experiment in fig .",
    "[ stress - strain ] can be ruled out simply by verifying that the initial point has zero mean stress .",
    "a more sophisticated proposition is embodied in the ` shear - transformation zone ' theory ( stz ) in which it is conjectured that plasticity occurs in localized regions whose densities differ for positive and negative strains , denoted @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the normalized difference between these , denoted as @xmath3 , is a function of the loading history and can , in principle , characterize the anisotropy that we are seeking .",
    "unfortunately the precise nature of the stz s was never clarified , and it is unknown how to measure either @xmath1 , @xmath2 or @xmath3 , making it quite impossible to put this proposition under a direct test .",
    "more recently it was proposed that the sought after anisotropy can be characterized in granular matter by the fabric tensor @xmath4 which captures the mean orientation of the contact normals , @xmath5 , through the spatial average of their diadic product @xcite .",
    "this order parameter was generalized for silica glass where @xmath5 was chosen as a unit vector in the direction of the vector distance between si atoms , disregarding the oxygens . attempting to test this proposition in the context of the best - studied model of glass - forming ,",
    "i.e. a binary mixtures of point particles with two interaction lengths , or in the case of multi - dispersed point particles ( see below for details ) , did not reveal any systematic signature of anisotropy .",
    "we thus conclude that this order parameter is not sufficiently general to be of universal use in the development of the theory of elasto - plasticity , and that the question of identifying a missing order parameter remains open .",
    "to see what may serve as a general order parameter we examine first the situation with the isotropic amorphous solid which is obtained after a quench without any loading history . denoting the shear stress by @xmath6 and the shear strain by @xmath7",
    ", we observe that isotropy dictates that all the even derivatives @xmath8 must vanish by symmetry . for example a function that can model the stress - strain curve with this constraint in mind may be @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the flow stress ( the mean value of the stress in the elasto - plastic steady state ) , and @xmath11 is the shear modulus . for @xmath12",
    "this function is perfectly anti - symmetric as required for an isotropic system .",
    "imagine now that we add even derivatives to this function , say @xmath13 with @xmath14 having the dimension of stress .",
    "the effect will be to change the stress - strain curve as seen in fig .",
    "[ toymodel ] , which is quite reminiscent of the bauschinger effect .",
    "we therefore propose that it is advantageous to focus on the even derivatives of @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 , with the most important one being the second derivative .",
    "note nevertheless that the _ mechanism _ leading to the existence of a second derivative in our systems is not obvious in this simple model .",
    "the second derivative appears due to plastic deformations whose effect adds up to breaking the isotropic symmetry of the freshly quenched state .",
    "we will show that at the bauschinger point the second derivative is non - zero due to existing closer mechanical instabilities in one straining direction than in the opposite .      under external loads",
    "the displacement field @xmath15 describes how a material point moved from its equilibrium position .",
    "the strain field is defined ( to second order ) as @xmath16 where here and below repeated greek indices are summed upon .",
    "we expand the free energy density @xmath17 up to a constant in terms of the strain tensor @xmath18 the mean stress is defined as @xmath19 , and @xmath20 in our simulations we apply a simple shear deformation using the transformation of coordinates according to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a small strain increment from any reference strain @xmath23 . the explicit 2d strain tensor following eq .",

    "our proposition is to use the athermal limit of this sum as the characterization of the anisotropy that we seek .      below we employ a model system with point particles of equal mass @xmath3 and positions @xmath31 in two and three - dimensions , interacting via a pairwise potential of the form @xmath32 & \\ ! , \\ !",

    "but even more detailed information which is highly relevant to the elasto - plastic behavior can be gleaned from the _ probability distributions functions ( pdf s ) _ of @xmath71 .",

    "this condition introduces the all - important hessian matrix @xmath85 and the ` non - affine force ' @xmath86 which can both be computed from the interparticle interactions .",
    "we rewrite this condition as @xmath87 where the second equation results from expanding in the eigenfunctions of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and the last estimate stems from our knowledge that in finite systems the plastic event is associated with a single eigenvalue going through zero when the systems slides over a saddle .",

    "close to mechanical instabilities @xmath71 is expected to diverge like @xmath104 with a sign that depends on the direction of imposed strain .",
    "even though we sample our configurations from system with temperature where the singular points are not reached due to thermal activations , the proximity of these mechanical instabilities in a specific straining direction is signalled by the large values of @xmath71 that we measure .",
    "we have proposed here a new measure of the deformation - history induced anisotropy in amorphous solids .",
    "this measure is not model dependent and is easily accessible to simulations and experiments .",
