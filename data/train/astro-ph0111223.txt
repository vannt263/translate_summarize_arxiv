    "dynamical effects have been mainly ignored in classical stellar evolution during several decades even if they have been explored theoretically ( zahn 1974 , 1992 ) .",
    "nowadays , helioseismology provides observational constrains on such effects and therefore allow us to begin to introduce them in the description of main sequence stars ( frolich et al .",
    "1997 ; gabriel et al . 1997 ; kosovichev et al .",
    "it permits observations of the solar convective layers complex motions .",
    "moreover acoustic mode determination allows the extraction of the rotation and sound speed profiles down to the energy - generation core ( kosovichev et al .",
    "1997 ; dziembowski 1998 ; turck - chize et al .",
    "meridional circulation begins to be accessible to the solar seismic observations and some ( magneto ) hydrodynamical instability has been put in evidence at the base of the convective zone . in order to see the consequences of such a process , we have focused our attention on two elements @xmath1 and @xmath3 which are destroyed in stars from the center to regions located slightly below the natural transition between transport of energy by radiation and by convection .",
    "lithium surface abundances history is directly related to physical processes in this region which is at the same time important for understanding dynamos in stars and also probably the role of the internal magnetic field in general .",
    "brun , turck - chize , & zahn ( 1999 ) have invoked the hydrodynamical instability proposed by spielgel & zahn ( 1992 ) to explain both recent helioseismic results and the solar lithium depletion .",
    "they introduced a turbulent term in the equation of diffusion .",
    "this term is directly related to local rotation and differential rotation .",
    "evolution of such a mixing term with recorded surface rotation history of sun - like stars in open - clusters finally explains the present observed solar photospheric element abundances .",
    "it also produces the right order of magnitude of lithium destruction as a function of time for open - clusters older than a gyr ( ngc 752 , m67 ) .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the different ingredients of the mainsequence ( ms ) and above all premainsequence ( pre - ms ) structural evolution of solar - like stars through the excellent indicator which is the @xmath1 surface abundance . from that viewpoint",
    "stellar evolution models have received a lot of attention for a long time .",
    "almost forty years ago pre - ms evolution was already proposed to explain the low solar @xmath1 abundances relative to the solar system value as well as field stars and hyades depletion pattern with temperature ( bodenheimer 1965 ) .",
    "bodenheimer described the main features of lithium burning in pre - ms .",
    "accurate @xmath1 observational data for open clusters have similarly been obtained for long ( zappala 1972 ) .",
    "they have outlined the complex history of this element and suggested depletion with age on ms .",
    "in the past twenty years many theoretical and observational works have addressed the topic .",
    "these investigations suggested that the understanding of lithium abundance might be related to many different non - standard processes extending from microscopic diffusion ( michaud 1986 ) to large scale mixing through rotation ( baglin et al .",
    "1985 ) angular momentum evolution ( pinsonneault et al . 1989 ) or internal waves ( schatzmann 1993 ) . during pre - ms lithium depletion strongly depends on typical temperatures within convection zones and therefore input physics ( profitt & michaud 1989 ) . until today",
    "there is no safe explanation of lithium history among solar - like stars .",
    "it is very likely that various phenomena are indeed responsible for pre - ms and ms @xmath1 evolution as well as g - type stars depletion pattern and lithium dip .",
    "this controversial subject therefore remains a broad and active area of research ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 , 1997 ; ventura et al .",

    "this work intends to show results involving recent opacity and nuclear reaction rates determination .",
    "we consider possible variations of composition and non solar repartition among metals as in the next decade many improvements in the knowledge of the detailed photospheric composition of the young stars are anticipated .",
    "we envision variations of mixing - length parameter with age and a new hydrodynamical instability along with a realistic rotation evolution .",
    "we outline the impact of such improvements on the topic of early phases of evolution which is meant to be better constrained by future seismic informations . in section 2 , we describe the bases of the stellar models we use and examine the solar case in details .",
    "the role of the different elements through their composition and the opacity coefficients is discussed in details in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to convection & accretion and section 5 to rotation .",
    "finally we give some perspectives in section 6 .",
    "in this study , we consider models in the mass range from 0.8 to 1.4 @xmath0 and different compositions corresponding to the sun , the pleiades , and the hyades .",
    "our starting point is a fully adiabatic polytrope with a central temperature of @xmath4 3 @xmath5 k and a radius of 20 @xmath6 for @xmath7 star .",
    "so the computation begins prior to deuterium burning which corresponds to the observed birth - line ( stahler 1988 ) .",
    "we observe that models are still fully convective polytropes when the star reaches the birth - line with a radius of about 6 @xmath6 so we expect no consequences of this early - phase computation except the idea to take as an hypothesis an initial polytropic structure .",
    "models have been computed using the cesam code ( morel 1997 ) and all the updated physics useful for the refined solar models ( see brun , turck - chize , & morel 1997 ) . for the reaction rates of the pp chain and cno cycle , we consider the compilation of adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and for the @xmath8 the work of engstler et al .",
    "we use opal equation of state ( rogers , swenson , & iglesias 1996 ) and opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) above 5800k . for lower temperatures the opal equation of state is replaced by the mhd equation of state ( mihalas , dappen , & hummer 1988 ) and the opacities are from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) .",
    "interpolation of opacities are performed using v9 birational spline package of houdek ( houdek & rogl 1996 ) .",
    "the atmosphere is connected to the envelope at optical depth 10 where the diffusion approximation for radiative transfer becomes valid ( morel et al .",
    "the opacity atmospheric is rosseland mean opacity extracted from alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) or kurucz ( 1992 ) sets .",
    "we therefore do not use grey approximation .",
    "surface boundary conditions are @xmath9 when @xmath10 .",
    "standard mixing - length theory is applied and the convection zone is completely chemically homogeneous .    during the pre - ms ,",
    "stars are in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium and slowly contract towards zams within a time scale comparable to their kelvin - helmoltz time - scale . defining zams as the age where the thermonuclear hydrogen fusion provides 99@xmath11 of stellar energy the pre - ms lifetime varies from 30 myrs for a star of 1.4 @xmath0 pleiades composition up to 100 myrs for a 0.8 @xmath0 star of the hyades composition .",
    "the sun lies in between , with a pre - ms of @xmath4 50 myrs .",
    "the transition from fully convective object to radiative core structure depends on mass and composition .",
    "higher mass stars contract faster , increase internal temperatures faster and so decrease radiative thermal gradients faster . moreover lower metallicity accelerates contraction and decreases opacities which also favor radiative stratification",
    ". therefore lower metallicities and higher masses give rapid raise to radiative core . a massive ( 1.4 @xmath0 ) pleiades composition star develops radiative core after 0.85 myrs and a 0.8 @xmath0 hyades composition star after 3.5 myrs . in the solar case ,",
    "radiative core exceeds 1@xmath11 of total mass at 1.8 myrs and then fastly accelerates in mass and radius to reach dimensions very close to its actual dimensions at 25 myrs .    due to the swift convective movements",
    ", surface matter is repeatedly exposed to physical conditions that prevail in deep interior .",
    "figure 1 illustrates this point in showing the time dependent evolution of the thermodynamical quantities ( temperature and density ) at the base of the convection zone ( hereafter bcz ) in regard to the photospheric lithium for the case of a young sun . at the beginning of the considered evolution bcz ( which coincides with the stellar center )",
    "is too cool to allow lithium burning .",
    "as the star evolves on pre - ms , deep regions of convection zone temporally exceeds @xmath1 burning point in typical stellar conditions ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "@xmath1 therefore offers a direct insight over stellar internal structure and evolution as it is extremely sensitive to the appearance of the radiative core .",
    "we note that early @xmath1 depletion occurs in the very beginning of pre - ms . effectively , for 1@xmath0 , the bcz temperature increases rapidly from less than @xmath13 k to approximately 4 @xmath13 k at 2 myrs , the density increases also ( but not quite simultaneously ) up to 2 g/@xmath14 between 7 and 8 myrs",
    ". then they slowly sink towards values which are very near from the conditions of the bcz of the present sun .",
    "this evolution results in @xmath1 burning from  2 to  20 myrs .",
    "the way depletion occurs presents several difficulties .",
    "first , depletion takes place just at the bcz as convection rapidly recedes in mass - fraction passing from the whole star mass at 1 myr to less than 20% 20 myrs later .",
    "moreover depletion typical time evolves rapidly and decays to very low values compared to time scale evolution of the stellar structure down to @xmath15 years at bcz .",
    "these pecularities impose small time step and very thin meshes .",
    "+ computations suggest that one third difficulty must arise .",
    "early radiation zone stratification hardly differs from convection stratification . in other words",
    "the newly stabilized medium is ( and stays for at least 10 myrs ) close to convective instability .",
    "we can illustrate this using polytropes : the adiabatic polytrope ( @xmath16 with n=3/2 ) is harder than its radiative counterpart ( @xmath16 with n=3 ) .",
    "radiation zone which represents half of the stellar mass at 10 myrs , should there be more concentrated in the core .",
    "figure 2 shows the contrary .",
    "the fact that radiation energy transport replaces convective motions does not mean that radiative stratification immediately establishes . at 10 or 20 myrs",
    "the stratification in radiation zone is still very close to adiabatic stratification .",
    "this has consequences on rotation evolution as we shall see in section 5 .",
    "we believe this property to be related to kelvin - helmoltz time value .",
    "the stellar interior needs at least this long to redistribute thermal energy and evolve from convective to radiative structure .",
    "this suggests that little modifications in stellar structure or new phenomena taken into account could easily change bcz position at times from 10 to 20 myrs .",
    "we may for instance suppose that even a low energy density magnetic field would stabilize or destabilize the region .",
    "this point leaves a priori room for many non - standard mechanisms that will have to be investigated and that will probably lead to substantial variations in pre - ms surface @xmath1 depletion ( ventura et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "@xmath1 reaction rate is extremely sensitive to temperature . for typical pre - main sequence conditions , at the maximum temperature of bcz ( 3.5 to 4 @xmath13 k ) this rate varies as @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "the depletion is therefore very sensitive to conditions near the base of the convection zone ( figure 3 ) .",
    "consequently , the photospheric @xmath1 depletion strongly depends not only on the mass of the convection zone but also on the precision of the mass shell division at bcz .",
    "this point is essential to perform valid integrations .",
    "we have adjusted the mesh in order to limit the variation of the reaction rate at bcz between two layers to 15 % , this corresponds typically to meshes of 0.005 @xmath0 or 0.003 @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the typical @xmath1 pre - ms burning requires also a very accurate resolution relative to time integration .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of the characteristic time along the evolution . at 3 - 4 myrs",
    "we find a characteristic destruction time at bcz of only @xmath19 to @xmath20 years ( depending on composition ) .",
    "so we have adjusted the typical time step to be a factor 10 lower than the characteristic depletion time . in figure 3",
    "we have shown three conditions corresponding to the maximum of the temperature at bcz ( 3 myrs ) , to the arrival on zams and to the present age of the sun .",
    "for each condition , the depletion time varies by approximately one order of magnitude from bcz to the right end of the plot but this extension corresponds to only 10 @xmath11 variation of the mass of the convection zone .    .",
    "ratio of lithium fraction to initial fraction after pre - ms depletion phase within solar composition stars ( see text for details ) .",
    "our results ( ptc01 ) are compared to previous ones of dantona & mazzitelli 1984 ( da&m84 ) , profitt & michaud 1989 ( p&m89 ) and ventura et al .",
    "1998 ( v98 ) .",
    "p&m89a and p&m89b respectively corresponds to z=0.0169 and 0.024 . for @xmath21",
    "no depletion is predicted on ms . for",
    "@xmath22 star dantona & mazzitelli do not predict depletion on ms but profitt & michaud 1989 and us predict it . for these low mass stars",
    "lithium fraction therefore refers to a fixed age of 70 myrs .",
    "results of ventura et al .",
    "1998 are provided here only for solar mass stars as they do not give results for other masses in mlt framework .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     typical scatter between long and short lived disk is 0.5 dex and tends to grow slightly on main sequence .",
    "this does not agree with open - cluster observations that shows no dispersion in @xmath1 abundances from pleiades to hyades as can be seen on previous plots . on the other hand spread",
    "reappears in much older clusters as m67 ( jones , fischer , & soderblom 1999 ) . with a photospheric lithium of 1.1 dex",
    ", the sun is expected to have experienced a long - lived disk stars ( figure 10 ) , if this approach is correct .",
    "however one has to be very extremely cautious when drawing such conclusion .",
    "pre - ms depletion phase is overestimated as young open - clusters observations suggest .",
    "tachocline thickness and macroscopic diffusion coefficient depends on the rotation history and the metallicity .",
    "however if scaling laws of equations 3 and 4 are correct , we compute that differences in metallicity of 0.1 dex do not induce large enough modifications in rotation speed to significantly change tachocline diffusion coefficient or thickness in pre - ms .",
    "the general behaviour noticed for the sun is also observed for this cluster .",
    "but the computation shows that higher velocity rotating stars do exhibit larger @xmath1 depletion , this does not agree with present observations , indicating that rapid rotators have higher @xmath1 rates as their slower counterparts ( soderblom et al .",
    "1993 ; garcia lopez , rebolo , & martin 1994 ) .",
    "this point suggests that tachocline mixing , as it is now introduced in calculations , and probably any mechanism that would mix radiatively stabilized layers on pre - ms , could be partly inhibited .",
    "it is noteworthy that low mass star rotation are presumably evolving slower .",
    "a 0.8 @xmath0 star should reach peak velocity at 50 myrs .",
    "moreover such a star will retain its angular momentum longer so that tachocline mixing retains longer efficiency .",
    "this brings the star the wrong way for it is the lighter stars that present the largest discrepancy in @xmath1 content between current models and observations .",
    "this study confirms that lithium offers an extremely interesting insight over solar - like stellar structure and evolution due to its low depletion temperature .",
    "there is presently a discrepancy between computations of classical stellar models and observations .",
    "classical models predict no lithium depletion on main sequence whereas it seems to be observed in open - cluster lifetimes .",
    "it is reasonable to think that lithium evolution on main sequence is connected to some slow mixing rotationally induced process(es ) that occurs at the top of the radiative zone . in the specific case of our sun",
    "such a process is supported by differences between theoretical and measured sound speed in this part of the star ( btcz 1999 ) and by the agreement between photospheric observations and predictions for helium , metals , and lithium . during pre - mainsequence ,",
    "the lithium problem is reversed and classical uptodate theoretical models generally predict too strong depletion . we confirm that this depletion strongly depends on metallicity , in the calculation .",
    "it is not evident that it is currently observed in young open - clusters . in this regard coma ber and blanco",
    "i rather suggest an age dependence .",
    "moreover , early dispersion in lithium abundances has to be explained .    in this paper , we have studied the impact of different microscopic or macroscopic processes on pre - ms lithium depletion .",
    "first we note the important role of the choice of meshes and time steps in the very early phase ( before 10 myrs ) .",
    "secondly , we remark that the interpretation of data is presently difficult as @xmath1 depletion in open - clusters is a strong function of effective temperature and it is therefore very difficult to reliably relate an observed lithium fraction to a given stellar mass just because this effective temperature depends on detailed metal fractions that still have to be accurately determined ( see figure 6 compared to figures 7 and 11 ) .",
    "microscopic processes are mainly dominated by opacity coefficients and therefore through metal and helium fractions .",
    "we experience in models that the level of sensitivity to composition ( especially on oxygen and iron but not only ) proves how difficult the present situation is .",
    "this suggests that the dispersion in lithium abundances could be related to small dispersion in metal fractions or among metal fractions .",
    "this is all the more true as part of the observed scatter is surely related to observational questions .",
    "rotation history might induce such difference but on the other hand king , krishnamuthi , & pinsonneault 2000 note the @xmath1 abundance determination to be correlated to ( and probably biased by ) chromospheric activity .",
    "genuine dispersion could also be related to larger helium fraction variations which can not be ruled out even over small scales in the ism ( wilson & rood 94 and references therein ) . in the solar case , where all the abundances are known within 10% , we get the good order of magnitude of lithium depletion in adding a macroscopic effect to the implicit microscopic effect in pre - mainsequence",
    ". we do not observe also a large problem in hyades when using observed oxygen and iron are measured .",
    "nevertheless there is a contradiction between the large dependence of lithium depletion in theoretical models in comparison to the apparent quasi metallicity independence of the abundances in young open - clusters . to solve this problem",
    "we encourage measurements of photospheric abundances as carbon , oxygen , silicium , and iron on young t - tauri stars .",
    "similarly helium fraction needs to be carefully checked within clusters and if possible from star to star .",
    "such additional data can be deduced from binary systems , high mass stars , and importantly in solar - like stars thanks to the future asteroseismology developments .",
    "macroscopic processes are at play through accretion , rotation , and convection modelling .",
    "such processes are now crucial to understand accurately stellar evolution ( pinsonneault 1997 ) .",
    "accretion is likely to explain dispersion in @xmath1 fraction measurements , but it fails to bring mean abundances to an acceptable level . in pleiades case , required accretion rates at a given time are at the upper limit of observations for young t tauri .",
    "to improve significantly the situation they should last so long that total accreted mass would indeed be @xmath23 of solar mass during the first myrs following star formation .",
    "on the other hand it is also possible for young stars not to accrete from classical gas & dust disks but from planetesimals of protoplanetary systems which are not detectable today .",
    "such material infall could supply lithium and others metals in low mass convective enveloppes of post - ttauri stars .",
    "rotationally induced mixing gives satisfactory results regarding photospheric solar lithium abundance .",
    "these results are moreover consistent with hyades open - cluster observation when oxygen and iron fractions are correctly ie separatedly considered .",
    "rotation mixing process we consider is however unable to explain initial spread in @xmath1 surface abundances . treating",
    "more properly the fruitful ms tachocline mixing ( btcz 1999 ) in pre - ms leads to results not supported by observations ( king , krishnamurthi , & pinsonneault 2000 and references therein ) : we find a rotation-@xmath1 depletion correlation on zams .",
    "however it is important to keep in mind two points .",
    "firstly we recall that the present rotationally induced mixing is not related to angular momentum transport in the stars .",
    "it therefore offers a possible but certainly partial vision of lithium ms evolution .",
    "zams rotational velocity should affect @xmath1 depletion because of subsequent angular momentum redistribution ( pinsonneault et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) .",
    "secondly the rotationally induced mixing process we invoke has necessary a transitory regime that we did not take into account .",
    "for these two reasons @xmath1 depletion predictions of the tachocline mixing are more reliable between the hyades and older clusters than absolute predictions from star formation .",
    "hyades solar - like stars are already slow rotators and might have lost most of their angular momenta . from hyades to older clusters , lithium should traduce long term ( stationary ) mixing effects , and indeed the tachocline mixing give rise to the observed characteristic time ( @xmath24 ) for @xmath1 depletion on ms .",
    "finally it is possible that the convection parameter @xmath25 is sensitive to rotation and hydrodynamical simulations suggest it should be changed along hayashi track .",
    "the effect we mention is not very large , contrary to some previous studies but more work is needed to be sure .",
    "we have emphasized the absence of a well established radiative stratification in central parts during phases preceeding 20 myrs which is a tricky point .",
    "the first phase of lithium burning occurs at the frontier between cooler convective medium and hotter radiative ( but almost convective ) medium that lies beneath .",
    "this means that very slight additional perturbation ( through overshooting or instability for instance ) could give rise to a much stronger lithium depletion .",
    "this also means that very slight stabilisation phenomenon , related to magnetic field as it is suggested by ventura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) could save a large fraction of lithium .",
    "all these remarks on macroscopic phenomena encourage complementary studies implying hydrodynamics approach .",
    "this is also true to check if the star is initially fully convective and rotates as a solid body .",
    "the answers to those questions can only be extracted from earlier phases that include protostellar collapse and take into account hydrodynamical processes such as accretion in a consistent and more rigourous manner .",
    "authors are grateful to forrest rogers and carlos iglesias from llnl who made possible computation of opacity tables corresponding to non - solar repartition .",
    "they are also grateful to jean - paul zahn for enlightening discussion on stellar structure and hydrodynamic instabilities and to sacha brun for strong interaction .",
