    "corners that belong to the same row or to the same column are called adjacent corners , and otherwise they are non - adjacent or opposite corners .",
    "sides that share a corner are called adjacent sides , and otherwise they are non - adjacent or opposite sides .",
    "we assume that the vertex costs are given in a matrix of size @xmath45 , such that any specific cost ( the value @xmath46 for a given vertex @xmath10 ) can be retrieved in time @xmath47 .",

    "we will use the term _ minimum _ landmark set for a landmark set that is minimum with respect to cost . a minimum cardinality landmark set will be called _",
    "smallest_. as weights are non - negative , there always exists a minimum cost landmark set that is also a minimal landmark set . in some cases , when we search for a minimum landmark set , we will only consider minimal landmark sets as potential solutions .",
    "we will show , in particular , that the cardinality of a minimal landmark set is either a positive number in @xmath62 ( note that the upper bound was shown in @xcite ) , or it is equal to @xmath63 . we find that if @xmath64 , all minimal landmark sets have cardinality @xmath41 , if @xmath65 but @xmath66 , all minimal landmark sets have cardinalities of @xmath41 and @xmath63 .",
    "we will show that any minimal landmark set of cardinality at least @xmath42 has a specific form , and we use dynamic programming to find a subset of minimum cost of this form ( there can be sets of this form that are landmark sets but they are not minimal landmark sets ) .",
    "moreover , it follows from our results that the case of cardinality @xmath63 is the only possible case of an odd cardinality of a minimal landmark set .",
    "we also analyze minimal landmark sets of cardinalities @xmath41 and @xmath63 .",
    "the result for cardinality @xmath41 was obtained by melter and tomescu @xcite ( and generalized by khuller , raghavachari , and rosenfeld @xcite ) , where landmark sets of minimum cardinality were studied . the result for cardinality @xmath63",

    "our main algorithm applies several algorithms and provides a minimum landmark set out of landmark sets of cardinalities @xmath41 , @xmath63 , and at least @xmath42 .",
    "the output , which is a set of minimum cost out of the outputs , is a minimum landmark set .",
    "our main result is therefore an efficient ( polynomial - time ) algorithm for finding a minimum ( i.e. , minimum cost ) landmark set in a two - dimensional grid graph .",
    "that is , we solve the algorithmic weighted metric dimension problem on two - dimensional grid graphs .",
    "the cases of landmark sets of cardinalities @xmath41 and @xmath63 are relatively simple , and the main technical difficulty is to find a minimum landmark set out of landmark sets of cardinality at least @xmath42 .",
    "we will observe that every such set is related to a sequence that follows a pattern , which we will call a zigzag sequence .",
    "another variant of grid graphs , where the distances are according to the @xmath67 norm was studied @xcite .",
    "this first articles on the metric dimension problem were by harary and melter @xcite and by slater @xcite .",
    "the problem is np - hard @xcite and hard to approximate @xcite for general graphs , and it was studied for specific graph classes @xcite .",
    "applications can be found in @xcite , where some of these applications are relevant for weighted graphs ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we start with proving some simple but crucial properties .      without loss of generality consider the first row and the first column .",
    "we show that no vertex separates vertices @xmath68 and @xmath69 except for vertices of this double side . for any vertex @xmath70 such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 , we find @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( any such shortest path traverses @xmath75 ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the remaining vertices are on the double side , where any such vertex has either @xmath78 and @xmath79 or it has @xmath80 and @xmath81 . if @xmath78 and @xmath82 , then @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and if @xmath85 and @xmath81 , then @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "thus , for any two vertices , their distances to @xmath37 are distinct if and only if their distances to @xmath40 are distinct .",

    "otherwise , consider a side @xmath91 without a landmark . since every double side has a landmark , each one of the two sides adjacent to @xmath91 has a landmark ( and these are two distinct landmark as the two sides are disjoint ) .",

    "the landmark set has no vertex of the double side consisting of the last row and the last column , contradicting the property that it is a landmark set .    if @xmath116 does not contain any corner , then since any landmark set has a pair of vertices on opposite sides , its two vertices are on opposite sides .",
