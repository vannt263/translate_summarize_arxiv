    "the strong exchange field acting on the electrons in a ferromagnet provokes the damped oscillatory behavior of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "this effect is at the origin of the @xmath0-junction realization insuperconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( s / f / s ) systems @xcite .",
    "the study of the superconducting @xmath0-state sheds more light on the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in general and may be also important for superconducting electronics ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "recently such @xmath0-junctions have been successfully fabricated and experimentally studied in @xcite . while the existing theoretical approach @xcite provides a good qualitative description of the observed damped oscillations of the critical current as a function of ferromagnetic layer thickness @xcite , a more detailed description",
    "is needed to take into account the finite s / f boundary transparency . indeed , in @xcite",
    "nb / al / al@xmath1o@xmath2/pdni / nb junctions have been studied .",
    "in such junctions , the presence of the al@xmath1o@xmath2 barrier can be modeled by a very low transparency of one of the s / f interfaces .    in this work",
    "we develop a theory of ferromagnetic junctions with different transparencies of the interfaces providing a general description of such junctions near the critical temperature .",
    "we will concentrate on the studies of the properties of an s / f / s junction with a thin f - layer of thickness @xmath3 and large superconducting electrodes@xmath4 see fig . @xmath5 .",
    "the very convenient set of equations describing an inhomogeneous superconductivity has been elaborated by eilenberger @xcite .",
    "these are transport - like equations for the energy - integrated green s functions @xmath6 and @xmath7 , assuming that relevant length scales are much larger than atomic length scales . for our geometry",
    "all quantities depend only on one coordinate @xmath8 * , * and in the presence of the ferromagnetic exchange field @xmath9 acting on the electron spins in the f - layer , the eilenberger equations take the form ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the matsubara frequencies and @xmath12 is the angle between the @xmath13 *  * axis and the direction of the fermi velocity @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the elastic scattering time . in the following , we consider the  behavior of s / f / s systems close to the critical transition temperature @xmath16 , so we may linearize equations @xmath17 by putting @xmath18    usually the electron scattering mean free path in s / f / s systems is rather small .",
    "in such a dirty limit the angular dependence of the green s functions is weak , and the eilenberger equations can be replaced by much simpler usadel equations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the conditions of the applicability of usadel equations are @xmath19 and @xmath20 the second condition , is much more restrictive due to a large value of the exchange field ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "therefore the attempts to retain in the usadel equations the first correction in the parameter @xmath22 have been made in @xmath23 .",
    "they  have resulted in the renormalization of the diffusion constant in f - layer @xmath24 where @xmath25 the critical analysis of this renormalization in @xcite has revealed its inaccuracy , but has not provided the right correction . to resolve this controversy",
    "we perform below a careful derivation of the usadel equation for an f - layer retaining the linear correction over  parameter @xmath26    in the ferromagnet the cooper pairing is absent , so @xmath27 , and considering the case of the strong exchange field@xmath28 , we may write the linearized eilenberger equation for a function @xmath6 as @xmath29 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 refer to the fermi velocity and the scattering time in the ferromagnet .",
    "let us recall that @xmath30  is an anomalous green function averaged over the angles .",
    "then we may present @xmath6 as @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "so for @xmath33@xmath34 the averaging of this equation over the angles gives @xmath35 multiplying @xmath36 by cos@xmath12 , averaging and taking the derivative over @xmath8  we obtain @xmath37 then combining @xmath36 and @xmath38 we have @xmath39 neglecting in this equation the @xmath40 term , we obtain the usual usadel equation with the renormalized diffusion constant @xmath41 however the omitted term gives a correction of the same order as that coming from the diffusion constant renormalization @xcite .",
    "it effectively means that it is needed to keep higher order terms in the expansion of @xmath6 over @xmath42 ( legendre polynomials ) .",
    "multiplying @xmath36 consecutively by @xmath43 and @xmath44 and taking derivative over @xmath8 , we obtain after some algebra the following exact equation @xmath45 + \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{\\partial ^{2}f}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right\\ } = 0.\\ ] ] here we may already safely neglect the @xmath40 term , as it gives a contribution @xmath46 . in the result , in the linear approximation over @xmath47 the usadel equation is written as @xmath48 taking in mind that in zero approximation over @xmath47 the function @xmath30 satisfies the equation @xmath49 we may finally rewrite @xmath50 in the following form applicable for positive and negative @xmath51@xmath52 } { 2}\\frac{\\partial ^{2}f}{\\partial x^{2}}=0 .",
    "\\label{usadel eq in f}\\ ] ] so we conclude that the first correction in the parameter @xmath22 to the usadel equation leads to the somewhat different renormalization of the diffusion constant @xmath53 , comparing to what has been suggested before @xmath54",
    "@xmath55 \\right ) $ ] .",
    "this result has been also independently obtained by tagirov @xcite .    in the superconducting layer , the linearized usadel equation is @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the bcs coupling constant@xmath59and @xmath60 is the diffusion coefficient in s layer .",
    "the equations @xmath61  and @xmath62 are completed by the general boundaries conditions at the s / f interfaces @xcite @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where the notation @xmath66 is used for the anomalous green function in a superconductor ( ferromagnet ) and @xmath67 @xmath68 is the conductivity of the f - layer @xmath69 @xmath70is the characteristic length of superconducting correlations decaying in f - layer , and @xmath71 is the superconducting coherence length of the s - layer , the parameter @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the s / f boundary resistance per unit area . here",
    "we introduce two different parameter @xmath74  and @xmath75 , for the left and right s / f interfaces , assuming that their boundary resistances may be different .",
    "note that the parameter @xmath76 is directly related to the transparency of the s / f interface @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "the limit @xmath78 @xmath79 corresponds to a vanishingly small boundary transparency , and the limit @xmath80 @xmath81 corresponds to a perfectly transparent interface .    in principle",
    ", the equations @xmath61 and @xmath82 with boundary conditions @xmath83 give the complete description of the s / f / s junction near the transition temperature .",
    "let us start with a general solution of the usadel equation in the ferromagnet for @xmath33@xmath84 where @xmath85 \\sqrt{\\frac{h% } { d_{f}}}.$ ] similarly for @xmath86 @xmath87    we see that the complex wave - vector @xmath88 describes the oscillating exponential damping of the anomalous green function inside the ferromagnet .",
    "in the case of very small scattering time @xmath89 the imaginary and real parts of the wave - vector @xmath88 coincide , and so the characteristic lengths for oscillating and damping are exactly the same .",
    "the finite scattering length decreases the oscillating period and increases the damping length .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that in a pure limit the exponential damping is replaced by a much slower power damping , while the oscillations have a much shorter period comparing to the dirty limit @xcite .    to obtain the analytical description of the critical current in s / f / s junctions ,",
    "it is useful to introduce the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite @xmath92 in a superconductor , the equation for @xmath93 is the same as @xmath62 with @xmath94 , while the equation for @xmath95 is much simpler @xmath96 and the  self consistency equation reads as @xmath97 the boundary conditions @xmath98 will be the same for @xmath90 and @xmath91 functions too . using the solution of @xmath99 for @xmath100 , it may be demonstrated  ( see also@xcite ) that in the case of a rather large resistivity of the f layer @xmath101 or@xmath59 in the case low transparency of the interfaces , when the condition @xmath102 is satisfied , the boundary conditions for @xmath103 functions are essentially simplified @xmath104 further on , introducing the functions @xmath105 we obtain the following system of equations for the order parameter and its derivatives on the left and right sides of the junction @xmath106 this system of six equations , after the elimination of four coefficients  of the type @xmath107 may be reduced to a standard linear form of @xmath108 @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111@xmath112 which was used by de gennes in his general description of the josephson junction close to @xmath16 @xcite@xmath113 following the approach @xcite@xmath4 the critical current of the sfs junction is given directly by the expression @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the electron density of states in s electrodes when they are in the normal state .",
    "the calculation of the coefficient @xmath116 is straightforward but rather cumbersome for a general case .",
    "the corresponding formula is to intricate to be presented here .",
    "so , to discuss the essential physics , we consider below only the most interesting limits .    in the case of highly transparent interfaces ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an analytical expression of the critical current taking into account the first order correction over @xmath22 in the usadel equation @xmath117@xmath118 where the complex wave vector @xmath119 \\sqrt{\\frac{h}{d_{f}}}.$ ] the dependences @xmath120 for different parameter @xmath22 are presented in fig . @xmath121 .",
    "when the critical current goes through zero , the transition from @xmath122 to @xmath123-shift josephson contact takes place .",
    "as expected , with the increase of the scattering time the period of oscillations becomes somewhat shorter , while its amplitude increases .",
    "this is consistent with a power low decrease of the critical current with f - layer thickness in the clean limit @xcite .",
    "further we concentrate on the influence of the s / f boundary transparency on the @xmath124 oscillations , and then we neglect the @xmath22 correction in the diffusion coefficient . starting with the case of completely transparent interfaces",
    "@xmath125 we retrieve the corresponding expression previously obtained in @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 in the case of low transparency of both interfaces @xmath128 the critical current is @xmath129 if one interface ( the left s / f interface ) is transparent , @xmath130 the critical current is @xmath131 } \\right|    \\label{gamma = zero}\\ ] ] if one interface ( the first s / f interface ) has a low transparency , @xmath132 the critical current is @xmath133 } { ( 1 - 2\\gamma _ { b2}^{2})\\cos ( 2x)+(1 + 2\\gamma _ { b2}^{2})\\cosh ( 2x)-2\\gamma _ { b2}\\left [ \\sin ( 2x)-\\sinh ( 2x)\\right ] } % \\right|    \\label{gamma = inf}\\ ] ]    the evolution of the @xmath120 dependence with the decrease of the transparency of the second interface is presented in fig .",
    "we observe that with the increase of @xmath75  the amplitude of oscillations decreases , as well as the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer corresponding to the first zero of the critical current .    in the experiment @xcite , the presence of al@xmath1o@xmath2 barrier at one s / f",
    "boundary can be modeled by a low transparency interface @xmath135 while the other boundary is quite transparent @xmath136 the resistance @xmath137 per unit area of the s / f / s junction in this experiment is dominated by the resistance of the tunnel barrier and thus @xmath138 .",
    "so we may expect that the experimental situation @xcite must be described by the expression @xmath139 with @xmath140 i.e. @xmath141 note that this expression is quite different from that used in @xcite to fit the experimental data .",
    "unfortunately in @xcite there is no information which could shed light not only on the reasons of the discrepancy between our formula but even at the origin of the used theoretical expression .",
    "the experimental results on the @xmath120 oscillations presented in @xcite have been obtained at low temperature .",
    "nevertheless we think that the overall shape of the @xmath120 curve is not very sensitive to the temperature and we compare the experimental data @xcite with our theoretical expression @xmath142 in fig .",
    "@xmath143 we use as the fitting parameter @xmath144  , while the experiment @xcite provided a value of @xmath145 around @xmath146   in our notation . the value of the other fitting parameter @xmath147is @xmath148 @xmath149 ; this parameter is quite difficult to estimate because of the uncertainty on the value of @xmath150 at the s / f interface in the geometry of experiment @xcite@xmath113 also following the analysis of the authors @xcite  presented in their previous publication@xcite , we have taken into account that the actual ferromagnetic thickness of pdni layer is reduced by @xmath151   due to some interdiffusion at the s / f interface . the obtained description of the experimental data @xcite is quite satisfactory .    in conclusion ,",
