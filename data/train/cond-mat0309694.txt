    "quantum phase transitions in the quantum hall regime were first studied by h.p .",
    "wei et al .",
    "@xcite who demonstrated that the _ width _ @xmath0 of the transitions between adjacent quantum hall plateaus ( pp transitions ) becomes infinitely narrow as the temperature @xmath1 goes to zero .",
    "an algebraic behavior @xmath2 with @xmath3 was found , independent of the landau level@xcite .",
    "this indicated that the pp transitions in the quantum hall regime should be regarded as a _ quantum critical phenomenon _ with universal critical indices@xcite .",
    "an overwhelming majority of subsequent experiments , by many others@xcite , have primarily revealed the elusive character of the quantum phase transition .",
    "these experiments , unlike those by h.p .",
    "_ , were primarily conducted on arbitrarily chosen samples that did not provide any access to the quantum critical phenomenon , given the well known experimental limitations in reaching @xmath4 .",
    "it is well understood , although still not generally recognized as such , that in order to be able to experimentally probe the true @xmath4 asymptotics of the quantum phase transition , the dominant scattering mechanism of the electron gas should be provided by _ short ranged potential fluctuations_.",
    "smoothly varying potential fluctuations ( relative to the magnetic length ) like those present in the @xmath5 heterostructure mainly give rise to an anomalously large _ crossover _",
    "length scale for scaling such that quantum criticality can not be retrieved in the experiment which is conducted at finite @xmath1 .",
    "crossover phenomena , especially those between _ percolation _ and _ localization",
    "_ , have in general remained difficult to grasp .",
    "nevertheless , they do exist as an integral chapter in the renormalization theory of the quantum hall effect@xcite .",
    "these phenomena play a crucial and fundamental role in the understanding of not only laboratory experiments but also the numerical experiments on the plateau transitions in the quantum hall regime .    yet",
    "another complication is well known to play a major role , the presence of macroscopic sample inhomogeneities that are inherent to the experiments .",
    "notice that spatial variations in the electron density mainly produce a spatially varying filling fraction @xmath6 of the landau level .",
    "any such macroscopic inhomogeneity in the electron density , no matter how small , will eventually complicate the critical behavior of the electron gas in the limit where @xmath1 and , hence , the _ width _ @xmath7 of the plateau transitions goes to zero .",
    "the experimental situation is in many ways similar to that of an ordinary liquid - gas phase transition where , as is well known , inhomogeneity effects due to gravity prevents one from entering arbitrary deeply into the critical phase .",
    "unlike the liquid gas phase transition , however , there hardly exists any detailed study or systematic knowledge on the inhomogeneity problem , especially in low mobility heterostructures .",
    "transport measurements on the hall bar geometry at low @xmath1 usually give rise to rather different results depending on the pairs of contacts that are being used , the polarity of the external field @xmath8 etc .",
    "besides these geometrical aspects one generally observes also slight differences in the data taken from different experimental runs , before and after the sample has been heated up to room temperature ( @xmath1 ) and then cooled down again@xcite .",
    "these annoying and puzzling complications have been the primary reason why the experiments on the hall bar geometry have so far not provided any reliable information on the details of the _ scaling functions _ of the conductivity parameters in the transition regime between adjacent quantum hall plateaus , notably the peak value and the shape of @xmath9 .",
    "moreover , the most important and fundamental aspect of the problem , the numerical value of the critical index @xmath10 , has remained an unsettled experimental problem . in spite of the fact that the original data of h.p .",
    "wei _ et.al .",
    "_ have provided an impressive experimental demonstration of a quantum phase transition in the quantum hall regime , over the largest possible range of experimental @xmath1 , it has remained somewhat uncertain whether the extracted value of the exponent @xmath3 is in fact the true _",
    "critical _ value , or whether it represents an _ effective _ exponent resulting from an admixture of quantum critical behavior and sample dependent effects due to macroscopic inhomogeneities .",
    "unexpected insights into the problem have been obtained more recently@xcite , as a result of a series of detailed studies on quantum transport taken from the lowest landau level ( pi transition ) of a low mobility @xmath11 heterostructure@xcite , quite contrary to the general statement which says that the basic phenomenon of quantum criticality is independent of the landau level , there are , from an experimental point of view , fundamental and surprising differences .",
    "it turns out that the _ plateau - insulator _ or pi transition is generally much less affected by sample inhomogeneities than the _ plateau - plateau _ or pp transitions taken from the same sample .",
    "the difference primarily reveals itself in terms of previously unrecognized _ symmetries _ in the observed magneto resistance data under a change in the _ polarity _ of the external magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the pi transition , unlike the pp transitions , displays very specific and general features that permit one to disentangle the quantum critical aspects of the transport data ( particle - hole symmetry , critical exponents , scaling functions ) and those that are non - universal and sample dependent ( gradients in the electron density , contact misalignments ) . as a result of all this , one can now say that the previously accepted experimental value of the exponent @xmath12 is slightly incorrect . instead",
    ", a new value has been obtained , @xmath13 .",
    "this new result indicates that the quantum critical phenomenon belongs to a new , non - fermi - liquid universality class , in agreement with the more recent advancements of the theory of localization and interaction effects in the quantum hall regime@xcite . at the same time",
    ", the new studies also indicate that the _ scaling functions _ of the transport parameters @xmath9 and @xmath14 are , in fact , universal and in accordance with the statement of self - duality under the chern simons mapping .",
    "these surprising advances illuminate the problem of quantum criticality in the quantum hall regime by revealing all the features sought in the pp transition that previously remained concealed . in this paper",
    "we elaborate on the new insights that one has gained from the studies of the pi transition and embark on the specific difficulties associated with the pp transitions .",
    "we set up a general , conceptual framework that enables one to not only recognize the effects of macroscopic inhomogeneities from the experimental data , but also perform the appropriate quantitative analyses .",
    "following the findings of ref .",
    "there are two distinctly different physical mechanisms at work in the experiments .",
    "these mechanisms are    1 .   a linear gradient in the electron density across the hall bar , 2 .   a misalignment of the contacts on the hall bar",
    "our main objective is to demonstrate , both experimentally and theoretically , that these physical mechanisms have a quite general significance for the electron gas .",
    "they describe the inhomogeneity effects in the transport data of not only the pi transition at strong values of @xmath8 , but also the pp transitions at intermediately strong @xmath8 as well as the regime of semiclassical transport ( or weak quantum interference regime ) that generally occurs at weak values of @xmath8 .",
    "we will show that the aforementioned mechanisms manifest themselves quite differently , with distinctly different physical consequences , in each regime of @xmath8 that one is interested in .    as a general remark we can say that the experiments on the pp transitions are most dramatically affected , even by relatively weak inhomogeneities in the electron density . whereas in practice the complications are much less severe for both the pi transition and the semiclassical regime and the corrections are relatively simple , this is generally not the case for the pp transitions .",
    "the main reason is that the effects of density gradients appear with a strength proportional to @xmath15 , i.e. the derivative of the hall resistance with respect to the external field .",
    "this quantity tends to diverge at the center of the pp transition as @xmath1 approaches absolute zero .",
    "these effects , however , are very weak in the semiclassical regime and even absent near the pi transition where the hall resistance @xmath16 remains quantized and equal to @xmath17 at low @xmath1 .",
    "this , then , is the basic answer to the inhomogeneity problem stated at the outset .",
    "it summarizes , at the same time , the principal conclusions of this paper .",
    "we already mentioned the fact that _ symmetries _ play an important role in this magneto resistance problem .",
    "for example , the recent analysis of the pi transition is based , to a large extend , on an idea borrowed from the renormalization theory of the quantum hall effect which says that _ particle - hole _",
    "symmetry is a fundamental aspect of quantum criticality in the quantum hall regime@xcite .",
    "this symmetry indicates , crudely speaking , that the lines @xmath18 should emerge as axes of symmetry in the @xmath9 and @xmath14 conductivity plane .",
    "it has been known for a long time , however , that this symmetry is generally violated in the experiment at low @xmath1 , due to the presence of macroscopic inhomogeneities in the sample@xcite .    as far as the pp transitions are concerned , the standard way of dealing with this problem has been to `` average '' over the transport data taken at opposite polarities of the external field @xmath8 .",
    "this procedure can not always be taken seriously , however , because the raw experimental data , especially at low @xmath1 , usually deviates substantially from the `` averaged '' value . in this paper",
    "we elaborate on yet another , previously unrecognized symmetry of the the pp transition@xcite that enables one to distinguish amongst the effects of _ density gradients _ and , say , _",
    "contact misalignments_. this symmetry which we term _ reflection symmetry _ indicates that no new information is added to the hall bar measurements if one changes the polarity of the @xmath8 field .",
    "more specifically , it says that under the change @xmath19 the different resistances , taken from the four terminals of the hall bar , are in effect mapped onto one another .",
    "we show that reflection symmetry is primarily the result of having linear gradients in the electron density across the hall bar and , therefore , it generally stands for an approximate symmetry only .",
    "nevertheless , it has experimental significance even when relatively large density gradients are present in the sample .",
    "most importantly , however , it teaches us how to proceed in order to physically understand and describe the difficult inhomogeneity problems that are associated with the pp transitions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline a theoretical analysis of density gradients in hall bar samples on the results of magneto transport experiments .",
    "initially we consider linear density gradients ( section 2.2 ) and obtain explicit correction terms for the longitudinal and transverse resistances .",
    "these reveal an important property - _ reflection symmetry _ - in the magneto resistances taken from different contact pairs , with reversal of the magnetic field polarity . these results are directly applicable to the transport measurements on the _ semiclassical regime _ ( section 3.2 ) .",
    "going beyond the linear approximation , section 2.3 presents the result of an exactly solvable nonlinear problem involving exponential density gradients .",
    "this analysis provides estimates of higher order corrections due to nonlinear gradients in the semiclassical regime .",
    "gradient effects and related symmetry properties in the high @xmath8 regime are also obtained . in section 2.4",
    "we explore the sensitivity of the quantum critical behavior at the pp and pi transitions to density gradients .",
    "this leads to specific limits on the maximum density gradients which must be satisfied for meaningful investigations of quantum criticality . finally , in section 2.5 , we discuss the recently reported experimental results on universality of the scaling functions of the pi transitions .",
    "we show , in particular , how they become generally useful in dealing with the more difficult problems that are associated with the experiments on the pp transitions . for this purpose",
    "we recapitulate some of the principle advances in the theory of localization and interaction effects in the quantum hall regime ( appendix ) and propose explicit scaling results for the pp transitions ( eqs 84 and 85 ) .",
    "in section 3 we apply the results of section 2 to the experimental resistance data taken from a low mobility @xmath20 quantum well .",
    "the low b , semiclassical transport data display many features expected from samples having linear density gradients , most prominent being the _ reflection symmetries_. we show how the true transport parameters can be extracted that are free from inhomogeneity effects .",
    "these in turn are shown to be useful , in section 3.2 , for the investigation of ( i ) the departure from the semicircle law in the @xmath9 , @xmath14 conductivity plane , ( ii ) the effects of weak quantum interference and ( iii ) the effects of higher order , nonlinear behavior due to density gradients .",
    "section 3.3 describes the experimental results on the quantum hall regime , bringing out the symmetry properties , as well as the limitations posed by the large density gradients in getting information about the quantum critical behavior of the pp transitions .",
    "in addition , the effects of contact misalignments are presented .",
    "finally , in section 4 , we present a summary of the results and the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "density gradients in hall bars , as well as other macroscopic inhomogeneities such as _ contact misalignments _ etc . , are long standing experimental problems that are hard to deal with in detail and difficult to control in general .",
    "the analysis that follows is based on the assumption which says that the _ spatial extend _ of macroscopic inhomogeneities is typically much , much larger than any of the microscopic or mesoscopic length scales in the problem of transport of two dimensional electrons . under these circumstances",
    "one can apply the results of ordinary electrodynamics .",
    "this means that one can describe the transport process by assuming phenomenological transport equations with slowly varying , position dependent transport coefficients .",
    "the general problem is actually a very old one@xcite and , as is well known , the complications are very specific to the magneto resistance measurements and usually do not arise in ordinary problems of quantum transport , in zero magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our physical objectives have nothing to do with , say , the mesoscopic type of ideas on sample inhomogeneity@xcite that are inspired by landau level systems with smoothly varying , long ranged potential fluctuations . for the low mobility samples that are of interest to us , semiclassical ideas based on the _ percolation _ picture only enter the problem in a fictitious regime of extremely low @xmath1 where , as we mentioned before , the experiment on quantum criticality has been completely destroyed , as a result of inhomogeneities in the sample",
    "quite obviously , the physical objectives of scaling , at finite @xmath1 , simply demand that one starts the analysis from the opposite limit where the effects of macroscopic inhomogeneities are negligibly small . indeed , one of the most important and difficult tasks that one is faced with is to make sure that the experiment is conducted in a regime in @xmath1 where the sample inhomogeneities hardly affect the basic phenomena of interest such that the appropriate corrections can be made .",
    "imagine a _",
    "density @xmath21 of dc electrical current that in principle may flow anywhere in the bulk of the sample as long as certain local and macroscopic constraints are satisfied .",
    "the _ conservation of charge _ is expressed by the continuity equation @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the _ total _ electrical current @xmath23 through the hall bar is constant and independent of the coordinate @xmath24 along the hall bar ( fig .",
    ", the condition for having a _ stationary state _ can be expressed using maxwell s equation @xmath25 .",
    "alternatively , we may apply stoke s theorem , @xmath26 = 0 , which says that no source of voltage should exist inside the the hall bar .",
    "the phenomenological transport equations can be written in the standard form    @xmath27    here @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the _ longitudinal _ and _ transversal _ or _ hall _ resistivity respectively which may be taken as phenomenological parameters that vary slowly in @xmath24 and @xmath30 .",
    "the aforementioned constraints imply that current density @xmath31 satisfies the following equations    @xmath32    by writing ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) = ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) we can also express eqs ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in terms of a differential equation for the scalar field @xmath37 alone ,    @xmath38 \\phi.\\ ] ]        except for the very special cases to be discussed below it is not only difficult to solve eq .",
    "( 5 ) in general but also very hard to extract relevant and physical information by pursuing a purely analytic approach to the problem .",
    "it is important to keep in mind , however , that we are primarily interested in the effects that are induced by _",
    "weak _ macroscopic inhomogeneities",
    ". an adequate description of the problem is obtained by employing what we call the _ linear approximation_. this amounts to having transport parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 that vary linearly in the coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath30 according to    @xmath39    here , the @xmath40 and @xmath41 are given as phenomenological parameters that may vary with @xmath1 and the external field @xmath8 etc .",
    "we assume for simplicity a rectangular geometry of length @xmath42 ( x - direction ) and width @xmath43 ( y - direction , see fig .",
    "1 ) . the coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath30 are defined relative to the center of the hall bar .",
    "it is easy to see that a spatially varying current density of the form    @xmath44    satisfies all the aforementioned constraints and boundary conditions . working to linear order in the coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath30",
    "one can write the transport equations as follows    @xmath45 j_x^0   \\\\ e_y & = & \\rho_h^0 \\left [ 1 + \\beta_x x + ( \\beta_y + a_y ) y \\right ] j_x^0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that the constraint @xmath46 fixes the parameter of the current density according to @xmath47 such that the transport equations can be expressed in terms of the phenomenological quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 alone    @xmath50 j_x^0 \\\\ e_y & = &   \\rho_h^0 \\left [ 1 + \\beta_x x + ( \\frac{\\rho_h^0}{\\rho_0 } \\beta_x   + \\beta_y   - \\alpha_y ) y \\right ] j_x^0 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these expressions can be used to compute the voltage drop @xmath51 that one measures on the _ top _ and the _ bottom _ contacts of the hall bar respectively .",
    "similarly one computes the potential difference @xmath52 that is measured on the _ right _ and the _ left _ contacts of the hall bar respectively . the total current @xmath53 .",
    "the results can be expressed in terms of the _ longitudinal resistances _ @xmath54 that one measures on the _ top _ and _ bottom _ of the hall bar ( fig .",
    "1 )    @xmath55    similarly , we obtain the _ hall resistances _ @xmath56 that are being measured on the _ left _ and the _ right _ contacts of the hall bar ,    @xmath57    we see that the measurements on the hall bar are affected by the quantity @xmath58 only , i.e. the gradient of the hall resistance along the direction of the current .",
    "one immediately recognizes that the measured quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to one another by _ symmetries _ that can easily be tested and observed in the experiment .",
    "notice that under a change in the _ polarity _ of the magnetic field @xmath8 the quantity @xmath61 in eqs ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) changes sign .",
    "this is unlike the quantities @xmath62 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 which are all even in @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , gradients in the electron density manifest themselves primarily through the following symmetry    @xmath63      in as far as one can trust the _ linear approximation _ , a best estimate for the local resistivity components @xmath28 and @xmath29 is obtained by taking the _ sum _ of the measured quantities on the _ top _ and _ bottom _ of the hall bar and those on the _ left _ and _ right _ hand sides respectively .",
    "@xmath64 at the same time , the _ difference _ between the various measured quantities provides a numerical estimate for the macroscopic inhomogeneities in the sample .",
    "specifically ,    @xmath65    here , @xmath66 denotes the typical difference between the local densities @xmath67 of the electron gas that exist on the left and right hand sides of the hall bar respectively .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first of all , for a more detailed understanding of the problem , it is important to know how and to what extend the results of eqs ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) are modified by the presence of _ non - linear _ effects in the density gradients , represented by the higher order terms in the series of eqs ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "progress along these lines will be reported elsewhere where we embark on a detailed quantitative analysis of the experimental data , in particular those on the pp transition .",
    "here we just mention the fact that the results of this section can be systematically extended to include the higher order expansion schemes , denoted by _",
    "quadratic approximation _ , _ cubic approximation _",
    "etc .    in this paper",
    "our objectives are slightly different . to understand the different ways in which the inhomogeneities manifest themselves we shall ,",
    "in what follows , discuss the the various different regimes in @xmath8 separately . in section 2.3 below",
    "we address the _ semiclassical _ theory of transport and introduce an exactly solvable model for density gradients .",
    "this enables us to discuss the general features of inhomogeneity that one expects to be relevant for the experimental studies at weak values of @xmath8 .",
    "in section 2.4 we address _ quantum hall regime_. it turns out that the pi transition , unlike the pp transition , lends itself to an analytic study on inhomogeneity effects .",
    "the results of this section are particularly illuminating for a general understanding of the experimental differences that exist between the pp and pi transitions .        the transport problem at weak values of @xmath8",
    "is described , as is well known , by the drude - zener - boltzmann theory . in the absence of any weak quantum interference effects",
    "we have    @xmath68    here @xmath69 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is given by the well known expression    @xmath72    to be able to study the effects of macroscopic density gradients beyond the limitations of the _ linear approximation _ we consider the special case where the electron density varies exponentially according to    @xmath73    here @xmath74 denote , as before , the coordinates relative to the center of the hall bar . under these circumstances",
    "one can express eq .",
    "( 5 ) in terms of the phenomenological parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 alone ,    @xmath77 \\phi .\\ ] ]    the most important feature of this theory is that it can be solved exactly .      the solution for @xmath37 which has the appropriate boundary conditions can be written as follows    @xmath78    this result implies the following simple expression for the current density @xmath79 one can next proceed along the same lines as outlined before and compute the the macroscopic magneto resistances @xmath80 and @xmath81 as measured on a rectangular sample of size @xmath82 .",
    "the result can be written as follows    @xmath83    here , the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath61 are formally defined at the center of the hall bar , @xmath84 , where the density is given by @xmath85 .",
    "specifically we have    @xmath86    one readily verifies that eqs ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , if expanded to lowest order in a series in powers of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , produces the same results as those obtained before , in the so - called _ linear approximation_. however , the present results also provide a more general insight into the structure of the theory that can not be obtained by focussing on the _ linear approximation _ alone . for example ,",
    "eqs ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) indicate that _ reflection symmetry _ , eqs ( 15 - 17 ) , is in fact a specific feature of the _ linear approximation _ that in general is violated by the higher order terms in the series .",
    "important for our present purposes are the following _ general _ conclusions that are very useful in experimental studies of macroscopic sample inhomogeneities .",
    "first , on the basis of eqs ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) one can write down the magneto resistance parameters in terms of a series in powers of the dimensionless quantity @xmath88 .",
    "the result takes the following form @xmath89 generally speaking , the coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath91 in these series appear as complicated expressions , describing in detail how the theory depends on the effects of macroscopic density variations . for the specific example at hand one can express the parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 in terms of a series in powers of the phenomenological parameters @xmath92 , eqs ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) .",
    "the results , up to quadratic order in @xmath92 , are as follows    @xmath93    secondly , it should be mentioned that eqs ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) still do not capture the most general features of density gradients in the semiclassical regime .",
    "the most general expression for the hall resistance also contains contributions that do not vanish in the limit where @xmath94@xcite .",
    "we summarize the results of this section as follows .",
    "assuming that the experiment at weak @xmath8 is not dominated by such phenomena like _ weak quantum interference _ , _ contact misalignments _ etc .",
    ", then the effects of sample inhomogeneity can generally be classified into two distinctly different sectors , the _ linear _ effects and the _ nonlinear _ effects .",
    "@xmath95 _ linear effects .",
    "_ these refer to the _ differences _ in the measured resistances    @xmath96    here , @xmath97 denotes the relative difference in the electron density that generally exists near the opposite contact pairs @xmath98 and @xmath99 of the hall bar ( see fig .",
    "@xmath95 _ nonlinear effects .",

    "it is readily verified that @xmath106 vanishes for the specific problem at hand , as it should be .    as a final remark we can say that the _ nonlinear _ effects are weaker than the _ linear _ effects by one order of magnitude in @xmath97 . nevertheless , the results give rise to a @xmath8 dependence in the experimental data that is distinctly different from what one expects on the basis of the semiclassical theory of @xmath62 and @xmath61 alone .",
    "next , we elaborate on the semiclassical results , eqs ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , for large values of @xmath8 .",
    "notice that in this limit the drude - zener boltzmann theory ( eq .",
    "21 ) indicates that the electron gas is in an _ insulating _ state . in terms of the conductivity parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 one has @xmath115 which is also known as the regime of the _ hall insulator_. in this interesting regime one observes , in the experiment at low @xmath1 , some of the strongest quantum features of the electron gas and , hence , the most dramatic departure from semiclassical transport theory .",
    "the results of eqs ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) nevertheless provide an interesting and instructive example of highly nonlinear effects due to density gradients .",
    "the first thing to notice is that the field @xmath8 in eqs ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) only enters through the combination @xmath116 .",
    "this indicates that _ homogeneous _ ( @xmath117 ) and _ inhomogeneous _ ( @xmath118 )",
    "systems behave very differently in the limit @xmath119 . as an example we consider the expression for the current density , eq .",
    "if we take the limit @xmath120 while keeping @xmath75 at a finite value then , dependent on the sign of @xmath116 , we can represent eq .",
    "( 26 ) as follows @xmath121 here , the @xmath122 sign indicates that all the current is now accumulated on either the _ top _ edge of the hall bar or the _ bottom _ edge . we have adjusted the amplitude @xmath123 in eq .",
    "( 26 ) in such a way that @xmath124 , the total current through the system , remains finite .",
    "next , depending on whether the current flows along the _ top _ edge or _",
    "edge , the expression for longitudinal resistances becomes either @xmath125 or    @xmath126    here , @xmath127 where @xmath128 denotes the relative uncertainty in the density along the x - direction . notice that @xmath129 is the same quantity that enters into the expressions of _ linear approximation_. finally , the result for the hall resistances is the same in both cases and given by    @xmath130    in deriving these expressions we have retained the terms to lowest order in @xmath75 and @xmath76 only .    the results of this section indicate that the strong @xmath8 predictions of the drude - zener - boltzmann theory are strongly affected , in a highly non - perturbative fashion , by the presence of even weak inhomogeneities in electron density .",
    "notice , however , that under these extreme circumstances the theory nevertheless retains _ reflection symmetry _ , eqs ( 15 - 17 ) .",
    "the results of this section actually provide a lucid example of a more general statement which says that _ reflection symmetry _ is in fact a quite commonly observed ( albeit approximate ) feature of the magneto resistance data taken from the hall bar , in the entire range of experimental @xmath8 .",
    "we shall return to this issue at a later stage , in the experimental section of this paper .",
    "it is easy to see that the macroscopic inhomogeneities are likely to complicate the experiments on the pp transitions in the quantum hall regime .",
    "notice that a spatially varying _ electron density _",
    "@xmath67 has roughly the same meaning as a spatially varying _ filling fraction _",
    "@xmath6 of the landau level system , @xmath131 where @xmath132 denotes the degeneracy of the landau level .",
    "the typical corrections described in the previous section can be written as    @xmath133    here we have used the fact that @xmath134 or @xmath135 is proportional to @xmath136 which tends to diverge at the quantum critical point ( center of the landau band ) as @xmath1 approaches zero .",

    "the results do not vary significantly in the range @xmath298 .",
    "along with the measured @xmath288 they are listed in table 1 .",
    "next , for the data corresponding to the lowest value of the electron density ( @xmath309 ) one has to follow a slightly different extraction procedure . according to the discussion following eq.[scxy ] one can use the @xmath14 data and obtain an accurate value for @xmath290 and an estimate for @xmath288 which is generally much less accurate , however .",
    "given the values of @xmath290 and @xmath288 one can next compute the electron density @xmath310 as well as the relaxation time @xmath311 .",
    "the accuracy of the computation is mainly limited by experimental uncertainties in @xmath288 .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath274 and @xmath291 are listed in table 1 .",
    "notice that the difference in @xmath67 at @xmath273 and @xmath291 is insignificant in view of the large error bars . on the other hand",

    "high field hall resistance , inset shows the difference of critical magnetic field for pp transitions , width=8 ]        we next consider the transport properties in the regime of high @xmath8 where the quantum features dominate for average electron density @xmath312 .",
    "7 shows the magnitude of hall resistances @xmath313 and @xmath314 as measured at the contacts @xmath98 and @xmath99 of the hall bar with varying @xmath8 up to 8 tesla and for both directions of the field .",
    "8 shows the corresponding data of the longitudinal resistances @xmath266 and @xmath267 as measured at the contacts @xmath315 and @xmath316 respectively .",
    "high field longitudinal magnetoresistance , width=8 ]    as a first investigation of inhomogeneity effects we study the symmetry of the data under a change in the _ polarity _ of the magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "following eqs ( 15 - 17 ) the two sets of data for @xmath266 and @xmath267 should be related according to @xmath317 similarly , the two sets of data for @xmath318 and @xmath314 should be related as follows    @xmath319    from figs 7 and 8 we observe that the statements of symmetry are all in qualitative agreement with the experiment at high @xmath8 , indicating that the gradients in the electron density still remain the principle reason for having imperfect data .",
    "the shift in the `` critical '' @xmath8 values for the pp transition as taken from the left contact ( @xmath98 ) and the right contact ( @xmath99 ) is directly related to the filling fraction @xmath320 of the landau level system .",
    "since the electron density @xmath67 varies along the channel of the hall bar , the pp transition at the low - density side ( ab ) occurs at a relatively lower value for @xmath8 whereas at the high - density side ( cd ) the transition takes place at a relatively higher @xmath8 .",
    "notice that this is precisely the statement made by eq .",
    "( 54 ) which says that for fixed @xmath1 and varying @xmath8 the measured hall resistances can be written as follows    @xmath321    here , @xmath322 and @xmath323 are the different but fixed electron densities at the left contacts ( @xmath98 ) and right contacts ( @xmath99 ) of the hall bar respectively . equating @xmath313 and @xmath314 amounts to taking different values @xmath324 and @xmath325 for the magnetic field @xmath8 at the left and the right hand side of the hall bar such that the filling fraction is the same .",
    "hence    @xmath326    from which it follows immediately that    @xmath327    irrespective of whether the landau levels are spin polarized or not .    in the inset of fig .",
    "7 we have taken @xmath328 as the difference in the value of @xmath8 where the data for @xmath313 and @xmath314 pass through the `` center '' of the plateau transition .",
    "we observe that the @xmath328 as taken from the different plateau transitions varies linearly with @xmath8 .",
    "the slope of the line gives an estimate for the relative difference @xmath329 in the electron densities at the left and right contacts of the hall bar .",
    "more specifically we have @xmath330 which agrees remarkably well with the aforementioned result ( @xmath331 ) as obtained from the low @xmath8 data .",
    "we have seen so far that the transport data at high @xmath8 do indeed display the features of symmetry as predicted by eqs ( 15 - 17 ) . at the same time one",
    "is also able to obtain reliable numerical estimates for the density gradients from the experimental data for both the quantum hall regime and the semiclassical regime .",
    "this , however , does not take away from the fact that additional features are clearly present in the data that are caused by different aspects of inhomogeneity . in this section",
    "we shall point out that a proper analysis of the experiment on the pp transitions is actually way beyond the limitations of the _ linear approximation_. this statement becomes most obvious by looking at the quantum hall plateau transitions in the @xmath313 and @xmath314 data ( fig .",
    "recall that the plateau transitions as observed in the @xmath313 and @xmath314 data are shifted by amount @xmath328 in @xmath8 due to density gradients .",
    "this @xmath328 , however , is comparable or even larger than the actual _ width _ @xmath332 of the plateau transition as observed in the same data .",
    "notice that @xmath333 is the quantity of actual interest whereas the ratio @xmath334 is identically the same as the ratio @xmath335 introduced in section 2.4 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present experiment is conducted in a regime of @xmath1 where one can no longer expect the data to provide reliable information on the quantum critical behavior of the electron gas , notably the numerical value of the critical index @xmath10 .",
    "this conclusion is entirely consistent with the experimental data on @xmath266 and @xmath267 ( fig .",
    "in particular , the measured @xmath54 provide a substantially larger estimate for the width @xmath332 of the pp transitions than what one obtains from the @xmath60 data .",
    "this discrepancy can simply be understood from the fact that the longitudinal resistance is measured along the length of the hall bar where the electron density changes the most .",
    "@xmath54 therefore represents an _ average _ over a range of electron densities .",
    "this is unlike the quantity @xmath60 which probes the local electron densities at the left hand side and right hand side of the hall bar , @xmath322 and @xmath323 respectively .",
    "these considerations simply illustrate the fact that the resistance data do not necessarily reflect the intrinsic properties of the quantum phase transition alone .",
    "macroscopic sample inhomogeneities may enter the problem in a highly non - linear fashion and , hence , they may fundamentally complicate the studies of quantum criticality in the quantum hall regime .     extracted from hall resistances at the cd contacts ( fig .",
    "1 ) . also the difference resistance @xmath336 with b values rescaled is plotted ( see text),width=8 ]      in this section we address the small deviation from the ideal reflection symmetry , eqs .",
    "( 15 - 17 ) , that can clearly be seen in the experimental data on the hall resistance , @xmath81 , in fig . 7 .",
    "whereas the data for @xmath313 nicely display the symmetry under the change @xmath337 , this is not so for the @xmath314 data which have been measured from the _ right _ hand side contacts ( @xmath99 , fig .",
    "1 ) of the hall bar .",
    "this asymmetry between the @xmath338 and @xmath339 signals can easily be explained , however , if one assumes that the _",
    "right _ hand side contacts @xmath99 , unlike the @xmath98 on the _ left _ hand side , are slightly _",
    "misaligned_. more specifically , by assuming that the contacts @xmath340 and @xmath341 are misaligned in the x - direction by a small amount , say @xmath342 , then the difference between the hall resistances , @xmath343 , should be proportional to the local ( near cd , fig .",
    "1 ) longitudinal resistance @xmath80 .    to test the idea of contact misalignment we have plotted , in fig.9 , the quantity @xmath344 with varying @xmath8 . as expected , the results look very much the same as the experimental plot of @xmath80 , fig . 8 .",
    "one can build upon these results in several ways .",
    "for example , one thing to notice is that the _ peaks _ in the @xmath344 data corresponding to the different pp transitions are shifted towards higher @xmath8 values as compared to the @xmath80 data in fig .",
    "this shift in @xmath8 is a result of the fact that the @xmath344 actually probe the local longitudinal resistance of the system at cd contacts where as @xmath80 represents an average over a range of electron densities .",
    "for the purpose of showing this we have also plotted the results ( denoted by @xmath336 in fig .",
    "9 ) that have been obtained from @xmath344 after a simple re - scaling of the @xmath8 axis with a factor @xmath345 . here ,",
    "@xmath323 and @xmath322 are the electron densities at opposite sides of the hall bar that we have considered earlier .",
    "the peaks in @xmath336 and those in @xmath80 now occur at approximately the same values for @xmath8 , indicating that the effect is dominated by the variations in the electron density that are _ linear _ in the spatial coordinates . for completeness",
    "we report the numerical value of the misalignment @xmath346 . on the basis of the magneto resistance measurements at low @xmath8 we conclude that @xmath346 is equal to @xmath347 of the length of the hall bar , @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "we have classified and analyzed the most important effects of sample inhomogeneity on the transport data taken from low mobility heterostructures .",
    "we have shown , in particular , that the presence of density gradients manifests itself most clearly in terms of a _ reflection symmetry _ that generally exists in the longitudinal and transverse magneto resistance data taken from the symmetrically placed contacts on the hall bar .",
    "the expressions obtained under the so - called _ linear approximation _ allow us to extract the main features of semiclassical transport and weak quantum interference , even for samples containing a density gradient of nearly @xmath348 percent . going beyond the linear approximation , we have introduced an exactly solvable model with exponential density gradients .",
    "the _ nonlinear inhomogeneity effects _ are found to be weak in the regime of semiclassical transport or weak @xmath8 , but they generally complicate the experiments on scaling of the pp transitions . since the sample used in the present experiments possesses density gradients which are rather large , it clearly brings out the futility of attaching meaning to the shapes and @xmath1 dependence of the magneto resistance measurements on the pp transitions . while it is best therefore to avoid the complications of sample inhomogeneities altogether , the analysis specifies fundamental bounds on the experimental density gradients which may be tolerated in the study of quantum criticality of both the pp and pi transitions .",
    "it is further seen that the experimental restrictions are far more severe for the pp transitions than for the pi transition taken from the same sample .",
    "these restrictions mainly place a lower limit on the experimental @xmath1 below which the quantum critical behavior of the electron gas can no longer be studied . along with the density gradients",
    ", our present experiments also reveal the effects of another common aspect of inhomogeneity , the misalignment of the hall bar contacts , that generally affects the shape and @xmath1 dependence of the quantum transport measurements at the pp and pi transitions .",
    "one of us ( b.k . ) acknowledges the kanwal rekhi scholarship of the tifr endowment fund for partial support .",
    "two of us ( b.k . and a.m.m.p . ) were funded , in part , by a grant from fom .",
    "in this appendix we point out that the universality of the scaling functions , eqs ( 72 - 76 ) , is actually a statement of universality made on the @xmath284 and @xmath349 functions of the electron gas . for this purpose",
    "we recall that the coulomb interaction problem generally involves the renormalization of three distinct parameters , namely the dimensionless conductances @xmath9 and @xmath14 as well as the _ singlet interaction amplitude _",
    "@xmath350 that is associated with the variable @xmath1 and/or the external frequency .",
    "the most fundamental quantities of the theory are defined as follows    @xmath351    here , @xmath352 denotes an arbitrary momentum scale in the problem and @xmath353 is known as the _ anomalous dimension _ of the variable @xmath350 or @xmath1 .",

    "_ @xmath95  periodicity in @xmath14  _ @xmath355 these symmetries give rise to the general statement which says that the quantum hall plateaus are described by a series of equivalent _ stable _ fixed points located at @xmath356 and @xmath357 . at the same time , the critical singularities of the plateau transitions are controlled by a series of equivalent _ unstable _ fixed points located at precisely half - integer values of the hall conductance .",
    "to establish the contact with the experiment we introduce the following quantities        next , on the basis of eqs ( 72 ) and ( 73 ) , which are defined on the interval @xmath363 , one can obtain the explicit expressions for @xmath359 and @xmath360 as follows .",
    "first we solve for the quantities @xmath137 and @xmath181                        secondly , we make use of the statement of _ periodicity in @xmath14 _ , eqs ( 77 - 79 ) , and extend the expressions for @xmath370 to include the entire range of @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath374 as a final step we can next employ the analysis of this section in a backwards manner and show that the solutions to the differential equations , eqs ( b.1 ) and ( b.2 ) , are indeed given by eq .
