    "the taylor expansion of the numerical velocities gives an idea of the magnitude of the error , provided that enough grid - points per wave length are used .",
    "the table shows that in the second order accurate case the phase error for the wave equation is 4 times smaller than for the advective equation , and that this improvement in accuracy is even stronger for the fourth order accurate discretization .",
    "furthermore , the standard discretizations of fully first order hyperbolic systems have numerical phase velocities that vanish at the highest frequencies and numerical group velocities with the opposite sign to the continuum one . in numerical relativity simulations involving black holes which make use of the excision technique to handle the singularity one can expect to see numerical high frequency solutions escaping from the black hole , if a first order formulation combined with the standard discretization is used , unless artificial dissipation is added to the scheme .    finally , whereas for ( [ eq : advective ] ) the transition from second order accuracy to fourth order implies the reduction of the courant limit by a factor of @xmath313 , for the second order in space system ( [ eq : wave ] ) , this transition requires a courant limit @xmath538 times smaller .",
