    "pulsating da ( h - rich atmospheres ) white dwarfs , commonly known as zz ceti or dav variable stars , comprise the most numerous class of compact pulsators .",
    "they are located in a narrow and probably pure instability strip with effective temperatures between @xmath1 k and @xmath2 k ( e.g. , winget & kepler 2008 ; fontaine & brassard 2008 ; althaus et al .",
    "zz ceti stars are characterized by multimode photometric variations of up to @xmath3 mag caused by nonradial @xmath4-mode pulsations of low degree ( @xmath5 ) and periods between 70 and 1500 s. the driving mechanism thought to excite the pulsations is a sort of combination of the @xmath6 mechanism acting in the hydrogen partial ionization zone ( dolez & vauclair 1981 ; dziembowski & koester 1981 ; winget et al . 1982 ) and the `` convective driving '' mechanism proposed first by brickhill ( 1991 ) and later re - examined by goldreich & wu ( 1999 ) .",
    "the later mechanism is supposed to be dominant once a thick convection zone has developed at the stellar surface .",

    "the first target star of our seismological survey is the most studied member of the class , the paradigmatic star g117@xmath0b15a .",
    "this star is an otherwise typical da white dwarf , the variability of which was discovered by mcgraw & robinson ( 1976 ) and , since then , it has been monitored continuously . the surface gravity , total mass , and effective temperature of this star have been the subject of numerous spectroscopic determinations .",
    "for instance , values of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 k , have been derived by bergeron et al .",
    "( 1995a , 2004 ) from optical spectra .",
    "koester & allard ( 2000 ) have reported somewhat lower values for the gravity and mass , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and a higher effective temperature , @xmath12 k , from hst uv spectra .",
    "g117@xmath0b15a has oscillation periods @xmath13 ( amplitudes @xmath14 ) of 215.20 s ( 17.36 mma ) , 270.46 s ( 6.14 mma ) and 304.05 s ( 7.48 mma ) ( kepler et al . 1982 ) that correspond to genuine pulsation modes .",
    "the star also shows the harmonic of the largest amplitude mode and two linear combinations .",
    "kepler et al . ( 2005a ) used the rate of change of the 215 s periodicity to show that the star has a c - o core .",
    "the first detailed asteroseismological study of this star was presented by bradley ( 1998 ) .",
    "this author obtained two different structures for the star according to the assignation of the radial order ( @xmath15 ) of the modes exhibited by the star .",
    "if the periods at 215 , 271 , and 304 s are associated with @xmath16 , respectively , this author obtained an asteroseismological model with a hydrogen envelope mass @xmath17 .",
    "if , instead , the periods have @xmath18 , the asteroseismological model was characterized by @xmath19 .",
    "note that there are three orders of magnitude of difference in the mass of the h envelope between the two possible ( and nearly equally valid within their models ) asteroseismological solutions .",
    "a similar degeneracy of seismological solutions for g117@xmath0b15a was also found by benvenuto et al .",
    "( 2002 ) on the basis of independent stellar and pulsation modeling .",
    "more recently , castanheira & kepler ( 2008 ) have found a seismological solution with @xmath20 and @xmath21 and another equally valid solution with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "finally , bischoff - kim et al . (",
    "2008a ) also found two classes of solutions , one characterized by `` thin '' h envelopes , and other associated with `` thick '' h envelopes , although their `` thick '' envelope solutions ( @xmath24 ) are considerably thinner than those of the previous works .",
    "each of the mentioned asteroseismological studies constitutes a clear demonstration of the formidable capability of asteroseismology to shed light on the internal structure of da white dwarfs .",
    "however , as important as they are , all of these studies are based on da white - dwarf models that lack a fully consistent assessment of the internal chemical structure from the core to the outer layers .",
    "for instance , in the models of bradley ( 1998 ) , although the c / he and he / h chemical interfaces are more realistic than previous studies that used the trace element approximation ( tassoul et al .",
    "1990 ) , the core c - o chemical profiles have a ( unrealistic ) ramp - like shape . in the case of benvenuto",
    "et al . ( 2002 ) , the artificially - generated models are characterized by he / h chemical interfaces resulting from a time - dependent element diffusion treatment , and the c - o core chemical structure is extracted from the independent computations of salaris et al .",
    "so , there is no consistent coupling between the chemical structure of the core and the chemical stratification of the envelope of the models . on the other hand ,",
    "the recent works by castanheira & kepler ( 2008 , 2009 ) are based on da white - dwarf models similar to those of bradley ( 1998 ) , with a parametrization that mimics the results of time - dependent diffusion computations for the he / h chemical interfaces , but with a simplified treatment of the core chemical structure ( 50 % o and 50 % c ) .",
    "finally , the study of bischoff - kim et al .",
    "( 2008a ) employs da white - dwarf models similar to those of castanheira & kepler ( 2008 , 2009 ) , but the envelope is stitched to a core that incorporates chemical profiles similar to those of salaris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "needless to say , white - dwarf stellar models with consistent and detailed chemical profiles _ from the centre to the surface _ are needed to correctly assess the adiabatic pulsation periods and also the mode - trapping properties of the davs , the crucial aspects of white - dwarf asteroseismology ( bradley 1996 ; crsico et al .",

    "these chemical profiles are computed from the full and complete evolution of the progenitor stars from the zero age main sequence , through the thermally - pulsing and mass - loss phases on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and from time - dependent element diffusion predictions during the white - dwarf stage .    in this paper",

    "the value of the thickness of the h envelope of our best - fit model is in perfect agreement with the predictions of the post - ltp scenario proposed by althaus et al .",
    "( 2005b ) for the formation of da white dwarfs with thin h envelopes . *",
    "the luminosity of our asteroseismological model allows us to infer a seismological parallax of g117@xmath0b15a , that is substantially larger than its trigonometric parallax . in agreement with previous works",
    ", we argue that the trigonometric parallax uncertainty is larger and the seismological derivation of the parallax is robust .    as for the complete sample of 44 zz ceti stars ,",
    "our main results are :    * we determined the spectroscopic masses of the 44 stars analysed using our da white dwarf evolutionary tracks . *",
    "the mean value of the asteroseismological mass is @xmath110 , slightly higher than our mean spectroscopic mass , of @xmath111 . given the completely different approaches employed to derive both values , the agreement can be considered as excellent .",
    "* our derived value for @xmath93 is in line with the mean mass of da white dwarfs inferred by tremblay et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , @xmath112 , and in good agreement with the value derived by falcon et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , @xmath113 .",
    "* there exists a range of thicknesses of the h envelope in the studied zz ceti stars , in qualitative agreement with the results of castanheira & kepler ( 2009 ) .",
    "our distribution of h envelope thicknesses is characterised by a strong peak at thick envelopes [ @xmath114 and another much less pronounced peak at very thin envelopes [ @xmath115 , with an evident paucity for intermediate thicknesses . * in most of the analysed davs ( 34 stars from a total of 44 ) ,",
    "our asteroseismological models have h envelopes thinner than the values predicted by standard evolutionary computations for a given stellar mass .",
    "however , our envelope masses cluster closer to the canonical envelope masses than those of castanheira & kepler ( 2009 ) .    in closing",
    ", we note that tremblay & bergeron ( 2008 ) have studied the ratio of he - rich to h - rich white dwarfs in terms of @xmath43 from a model atmosphere analysis of the infrared photometric data from the two micron all sky survey combined with available visual magnitudes .",
    "they found that this ratio increases gradually from @xmath116 for @xmath117 k to about @xmath118 for @xmath119 k due to convective mixing when the bottom of the h convection zone reaches the underlying convective he envelope .",
    "these authors conclude that about @xmath120 of the da white dwarfs should have h envelopes with @xmath121 between @xmath100 and @xmath122 .",
    "the asteroseismological results reported in this work point to the existence of large fraction of dav stars with h envelopes thinner than canonical values . in particular , 5 zz ceti stars analyzed have @xmath123 , which represents the @xmath124 of the sample of the studied dav stars .",
    "this fraction of stars with very thin h envelopes is compatible with the results of tremblay & bergeron ( 2008 ) .    in a detailed asteroseismological analysis of an ensemble of zz ceti stars , castanheira & kepler ( 2008 , 2009 ) have found that the h envelope of these stars could be within the range @xmath125 , with an average value of @xmath126 . in many respects ,",
    "the results of the present study are in excellent agreement with the predictions of castanheira & kepler ( 2008 , 2009 )",
    ". our different mean value for the h layer mass , @xmath127 , which is about 50 times larger than that found by those authors , could be due to the fact that our studies are based on completely independent sets of da white dwarf models , different pulsational codes , and different samples of stars .",
    "all these results reinforce the idea that a non - negligible fraction of da white dwarfs with thin h envelopes could exist , rendering as a plausible one the scenario proposed by althaus et al .",
    "( 2005b ) for the formation of da white dwarfs with @xmath128 smaller than predicted by the standard theory .",
    "hopefully , new asteroseismological analysis on a larger number of dav stars , including the zz ceti stars from the sdss , based on fully evolutionary da white dwarf models with realistic chemical profiles like the ones employed in this work , will help to place this idea on a firmer basis .",
