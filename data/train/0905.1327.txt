    "( 2005 ) provides a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between the highly ionized warm gas and the galaxy environment .",
    "below we consider whether the absorber is produced in individual galactic halos , intragroup medium in a galaxy group , or outflows from either a starburst galaxy or agn .",
    "the close proximity of the neviii absorber to multiple galaxies is similar to what is found for some ovi absorbers ( e.g.  stocke et al.2006 ; wakker & savage 2009 ) .",
    "it suggests that the absorbing gas is unlikely to originate in underdense filamentary regions , but is likely to be gravitationally bound to galaxies .      to assess whether the absorber is likely to be associated with an intragroup medium or a halo around a galaxy , we first estimate individual halo sizes of the galaxies based on their intrinsic luminosities .",
    "previous halo occupation studies of field galaxies have shown a monotonic relationship between halo mass @xmath91 and galaxy luminosity for galaxies fainter than @xmath92 and located at the centers of their dark matter halos . adopting the @xmath91 vs.  @xmath93 relation of tinker & conroy ( 2009 )",
    ", we estimate that galaxies @xmath46 , @xmath52 , and @xmath59 reside in halos of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 , respectively .",

    "the expected halo radii of these galaxies together with the projected separations between one another indicate that galaxies @xmath52 and @xmath59 do not share a common halo , whereas galaxies @xmath46 and @xmath52 ( separated by @xmath100 projected physical kpc and @xmath101 @xmath4 ) are likely to share a common halo ( based on the two - point correlation function , the probability of having two unrelated galaxies at this separation is @xmath9 0.5% ; @xcite ) .",
    "analogous to the local group , it is probably more appropriate to consider @xmath52 and @xmath59 as two separate halos , instead of a single virialed group  . with this interpretation of the mass distribution",
    ", it seems unlikely that the neviii absorber would be associated with a diffuse intragroup medium .",
    "given the projected distances from the qso and the @xmath102 estimates above , only @xmath46 and @xmath52 are viable hosts for the neviii absorber .",
    "here , we consider the possibility that the absorber originates in an extended hot halo around one of these galaxies .",
    "hot halos around individual galaxies are expected in the hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm . while such halos are commonly found around early - type galaxies ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1992 ) , the presence of extended hot halos around disk galaxies has not been confirmed ( rasmussen et al .",
    "2009 ) with the exception of the milky way for which an extended hot halo is implied from several observations @xcite .",
    "we first consider the more massive galaxy @xmath52 .",
    "the estimated halo mass of galaxy @xmath52 would imply a virial temperature of @xmath103 k , similar to the gas temperature ( @xmath104 k ) derived for the neviii absorber under the assumption of a collisional ionization equilibrium ( savage et al.2005 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that the absorber originates in an extended hot halo around galaxy @xmath52 .",
    "if the neviii absorption is produced by an extended hot halo , we can use the observed properties of the absorption to estimate the mass of the hot gas .",
    "@xcite derive a total hydrogen column density of @xmath105 for the absorber under the assumptions of collisional ionization equilibrium and metallicity [ z / h]@xmath106 . assuming a gaseous radius equal to @xmath102 , the total path length is @xmath107 kpc at the impact distance of @xmath108 kpc .",
    "this path length combined with the inferred column density , suggests the total hydrogen density is @xmath109 @xmath35 . for a uniform density ,",
    "the total mass in the hot gas within the virial radius is @xmath110 .",
    "this mass is significantly greater than the mass in stars @xmath111 as inferred by the broad - band spectral energy distribution of the galaxy .",
    "the difference would suggest that the hot gas revealed by the neviii absorption is the dominant baryonic component .    we have argued based on the mean space density of dwarf galaxies ( see   4.1 ) that galaxies @xmath46 and @xmath52 share a common halo .",
    "if instead @xmath46 is at a cosmological distance from @xmath52 and responsible for the absorption , the virial temperature is @xmath112 k for its host halo , somewhat lower than the temperature derived by @xcite .",
    "the gas mass in this case would be @xmath113 .",
    "this mass is approximately a factor of 10 times larger than the stellar mass , so as is the case for galaxy @xmath52 , the hot gas would be the dominant baryonic component if the neviii absorption was due to a hot gas halo",
    ".    however , the notion of neviii arising in an extended hot halo is difficult to reconcile with the relatively narrow line width observed for the neviii absorption feature , @xmath114 @xmath4 , which corresponds to a velocity dispersion of @xmath115 @xmath4 .",
    "this is smaller than the velocity dispersion expected from virial motion along the line of sight @xmath116 km / s and 42 km / s in a uniformly distributed hot gas in a halo of @xmath117(b ) and @xmath118(a ) , respectively .",
    "we therefore do not favor this scenario .",
    "next , we consider the possibility that the neviii absorber originates in individual clouds that are photo - ionized by both the intergalactic radiation field and local ionizing sources .",
    "recall that @xcite ruled out a photo - ionization origin of the neviii absorber because the implied path length given a mean intergalactic radiation field of @xmath29 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath15 hz@xmath15 sr@xmath15 at @xmath31 was @xmath9 11 mpc , too large for the observed line widths .",
    "the required path length would be smaller if the absorber was exposed to a more intense radiation source such as a local agn .",
    "here we examine whether our galaxy data can rule out the presence of such an ionizing source for producing the neviii absorber .",
    "to reduce the path length to a more reasonable size ( @xmath9 100 kpc ) requires the intensity of the radiation to increase by approximately two orders of magnitude ( up to @xmath9 2 @xmath65 10@xmath119 erg @xmath30 s@xmath15 hz@xmath15 sr@xmath15 ) . assuming a flat @xmath120 spectrum ( appropriate for an agn ) and adopting a @xmath121 scaling law",
    ", we estimate that an agn would need to be as luminous as @xmath122 at 38 kpc ( @xmath46 ) or @xmath123 at 110 kpc ( @xmath52 ) away in order to provide sufficient ionizing photons for producing the neviii absorber km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 for evaluating the distances between the absorber and galaxies @xmath46 and @xmath52 . ] .",
    "the expected agn luminosity already exceeds the observed luminosity for either of the two galaxies .",
    "in addition , there is a lack of agn spectral features in the optical spectra .",
    "we therefore conclude that galaxies @xmath46 and @xmath52 are unlikely to host a powerful enough agn to produce the observed absorption with photo - ionization .",
    "while photo - ionization can not explain the observed neviii absorber , we note that additional ionizing photons from galaxies @xmath46 and @xmath52 may contribute substantially to the ionizations of h@xmath124 , c@xmath125 , o@xmath125 , and si@xmath125 . adopting a flat uv spectrum for star - forming galaxies and assuming 2% escape fraction of ionizing photons",
    ", we estimate the absorbing cloud is illuminated by additional ionizing radiation intensities of @xmath126 and @xmath127 ergs @xmath30 s@xmath15 hz@xmath15 sr@xmath15 from galaxies @xmath46 and @xmath52 , respectively . the inferred gas density and size of the hi absorbing cloud",
    "are then @xmath128 @xmath35 and @xmath129 kpc . by assuming a spherical cloud , we obtain a mass of @xmath130",
    "however , the mass could be larger with other assumed geometries .",
    "next , we consider the possibility that the absorption arises in a starburst driven wind from the dwarf galaxy ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "based on the optical spectrum presented in figure 1 , we find that galaxy @xmath46 is forming stars at a rate ( @xmath9 0.1 m@xmath131 yr@xmath15 ) that is typical of dwarf galaxies at low redshift . with a rest - frame h@xmath132 equivalent width of @xmath133  , however , the galaxy would not be considered a starburst by most definitions adopted in the literature @xcite . combining the estimated total stellar mass for galaxy @xmath46 of @xmath134 and the observed star formation rate , we derive a characteristic star formation time scale of @xmath135 gyr .",
    "this is much longer than the characteristic time scale for typical starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "we also note that the major axis of the galaxy is oriented along the direction to the qso . as an outflowing wind",
    "is expected to be predominantly along the minor axis , the bulk of the wind is unlikely to pass in front of the qso sightline for the observed geometry . given the modest star formation rate in galaxy @xmath46 and the disk alignment , a starburst driven wind would seem incapable of producing the observed absorption 26.5 @xmath136 kpc from the disk of the galaxy .",
    "finally , we consider the idea that the neviii absorption is produced at the turbulent boundary layers of cooler clouds moving at high speed through a hot medium . this scenario has been proposed to explain the ovi absorption associated with high velocity clouds and the magellanic stream in the milky way @xcite .",
    "the redshift difference between galaxy @xmath52 and the neviii absorber leads to a relative velocity of nearly 200 @xmath4 , roughly twice the sound speed for an ionized warm - hot medium of @xmath44 k. although the clouds are expected to suffer from the kelvin - helmholtz instability , the inferred gas density and cloud size discussed in ",
    "4.3 suggest that the cloud may be massive enough to counter - balance such instabilities",
    "@xcite    a natural consequence of this scenario is that both low and high ionization species would be expected with a moderate velocity offset between the two components ( @xmath9 20 km s@xmath15 ) , similar to what is observed in the absorber at @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the conductive front idea is both consistent with the observed galactic environment and the multi - phase nature of the gas .",
    "combining the results of our galaxy survey with the absorption line analysis of @xcite , we have considered many possible origins for the @xmath0 absorber toward he0226@xmath14110 .",
    "we find that the absorber is best explained by a cool cloud moving through a hot medium .",
    "although our study suggests that the neviii absorption may not be directly probing the whim in this system , it does imply the existence of hot gas at least 76.5 @xmath136 kpc from a @xmath137 galaxy ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the existence of extended hot gas halos around disk galaxies is a key ingredient in most semi - analytic models of disk galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "however , there has been very little direct observational evidence for such halos in quiescent galaxies .",
    "perhaps the best evidence for an extended hot corona comes from the milky way , where the presence of hot gas has been inferred from many different observations @xcite .",
    "our observations provide evidence for a similar halo around galaxy @xmath52 . given the large extent of the halo , a significant fraction of the baryons in the system are likely contained in hot gas .",
