    "the blackbody radiation(bbr ) can perturb the atomic energy - levels and shorten the lifetime of states .",
    "it is well known that the thermal mass - shift induced by bbr is the main part of the one - loop thermal self - energy correction@xcite .",
    "the thermal mass - shift is proportional to @xmath1 and irrelevant to the atomic energy - level .",
    "the leading term of bbr - shift in the atom , which is proportional to @xmath2 , is the remainder term in the one - loop thermal self - energy correction .",
    "this effect is tiny .",
    "so it is always being neglected in the atomic energy - levels calculations . however , it is still necessary to consider bbr in some areas of atomic physics .",
    "firstly , in the precise calculation of the energy for simple atomic system , such as helium and lithium@xcite , the accuracy of the energy of the ground state in free - field , has been extremely high , which means many higher - order corrections such as quantum electrodynamic(qed ) effect , qed - nuclear recoil , qed - nuclear size , even if bbr - shift , could possibly be taken into account@xcite .",
    "this is foremost to determine the physical fundamental constant , such as the fine - structure constant @xmath3@xcite .",
    "secondly , in these decades , the bbr effect becomes an obstacle of accuracy in determination of frequency standard@xcite .",
    "several works@xcite have been devoted to study bbr - shift from 1980s . in those works ,",
    "the classical bbr s electric field approximation and rotating - wave approximation were introduced .",
    "escobedo@xcite and solovyev@xcite studied the bbr - shift in the hydrogen - like atoms by using the finite temperature quantum electrodynamics approach without previous approximations .",
    "however , the bbr - shifts in multi - electron atoms , which the atomic clock is based on , havent been studied by the same approach . and those results@xcite are the leading order of the bbr - shift .",
    "it is beneficial to make a further step to study the higher corrections , for example , the @xmath0 correction in this paper .",
    "the bound state is cumbersome to be studied by using the quantum electrodynamics(qed ) .",
    "we present in this work an efficient way , nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics(nrqed)@xcite , to attain the expected purposes .",
    "the nrqed is an effective field theory in which all virtual physics at scales greater than the electron mass have been integrated out .",
    "the advantage of using nrqed is that the perturbations can be calculated order by order . imitating the finite temperature ,",
    "qed@xcite , we replaced the photon propagator with the ensemble averaged photon propagator , when we adopted nrqed .",
    "we ve found a @xmath0 correction , which is important and could be lager than the leading term of bbr - shift when the high / mid-@xmath4 or cold hydrogen - like atoms are interrogated .",
    "this @xmath5- dependent correction has not been investigated by former works yet .",
    "we conjecture this effect will be important in multi - electron atoms or cold ones .",
    "we also estimate the one - loop contribution of quadrupole and the two - loop contributions of bbr - shift of the thermal(real ) photon .",
    "the order of magnitude bbr - shift indicates the one - loop contribution of quadrupole is stronger than the previous result . and",
    "the two - loop contribution of bbr - shift of the thermal(real ) photon is tiny . in this paper",
    ", we studied bbr - shift by using nrqed approach and obtained the @xmath0 correction in section 2 .",
    "the one - loop contribution of quadrupole and two - loop contributions of bbr - shift were estimated in section 3 .",
    "the section 4 is devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "the feynman rules for the finite temperature qed are given in fig.1 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we adopt a many - body fermion propagator in fig.1 , where @xmath9 are dirac matrices and @xmath10 are eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the many - body hamiltonian respectively . additionally , we adopted coulomb gauge to express the thermal(real ) photon propagator , which is derived from the thermal(real ) photon propagator@xcite in feynman gauge , by gauge transformation .",
    "the leading term of bbr - shift is induced by the thermal one - loop self - energy correction , which is represented by diagrams in fig.2 .",
    "the contribution of virtual particle pairs[fig.2(b ) ] is compressed by a @xmath11 factor in the room temperature .",
    "so all the diagrams that have a thermal photon propagator connecting with virtual particle pairs can be neglected .",
    "the contribution of diagrams in fig.2(a ) is     factor in the room temperature , can be neglected .",
    ", width=3,height=1 ]    @xmath12    where @xmath13 denotes the cauchy principal value , which is required for a proper treatment of resonant contributions@xcite .",
    "it is coincided with porsev s result@xcite , and contains bound - state - independent terms , which are called thermal mass - shift@xcite .",
    "the remainder term is the bbr - shift .",
    "the thermal mass - shift also exists in free electron as well and is much larger than bbr - shift value .",
    "the contribution of the fig.2 of the nonrelativistic approximation is represented as :    @xmath14    where the first term is the thermal mass - shift , the second term is the bbr - shift of electric dipole moment@xmath15 and the ellipsis is the higher order term such as the contribution of multi - dipole .",
    "the @xmath16 is the number of the electrons , and @xmath17 is the fine - structure constant .",
    "the contribution of electric dipole@xmath15 is @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the position vectors of electron @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the bbr s characteristic wave - length @xmath23 in the room temperature is much larger than the atoms radius , and the electron is nonrelativistic in the light atoms . additionally , the contributions of multi - polar moment are suppressed by @xmath24 ( magnetic dipole(m1 ) ) or @xmath25 ( eletric - quadrupole(e2 ) ) comparing with the contribution of the electric dipole(e1 ) in the room temperature@xcite .",
    "so the eq.(3 ) is the leading term of bbr - shift .",
    "the eq.(3 ) can be further simplified in the low - lying states in the room temperature(the approximation @xmath26 is applied to our work ) .",
    "thus we have @xmath27 which is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the relativistic corrections are nt included in eq.(3 ) , and these corrections can be introduced by the nonrelativistic qed approach@xcite @xmath28 where the inserted vertex @xmath29 is relativistic correction and breit interaction ,    @xmath30\\bigg\\}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if @xmath26 , the correction eq.(5 ) can be written as @xmath31 which is proportional to @xmath32 its magnitude is @xmath33 .",
    "the relativistic correction to current induces another correction@xcite @xmath34 where the current is @xmath35 where @xmath36is the charge number of the particle @xmath37 .",
    "the first two terms are proportional to @xmath1 , the third term is proportional to @xmath38 and the last term is proportional to @xmath39 in the low - lying atomic states in the room temperature .",
    "the eq.(5)(8 ) are the @xmath0 corrections .",
    "these corrections have not been investigated before .",
    "it is obvious that eq.(6 ) does nt contain the contribution of multipole of the thermal photon , which can be obtained from eq.(1 ) . for example , the quadratic term is    @xmath40    = &   \\dfrac { e^{2 } } { m^{2 } } \\mathcal{p}\\int\\frac { n_{b}(\\omega)\\omega^{3 } d\\omega}{(2\\pi)^{2 } }   \\dfrac{4\\delta_{ij}\\delta_{kl}-\\delta_{ik}\\delta_{jl } -\\delta_{il}\\delta_{jk}}{15 }   \\sum_{a , b } \\langle \\psi|\\bigg [ \\left\\lbrace   \\textbf{p}^{i},\\textbf{x}^{k}\\right\\rbrace_{a } \\dfrac{2(e - h)}{(e - h)^{2}-\\omega^{2 } } \\left\\lbrace   \\textbf{p}^{j},\\textbf{x}^{l}\\right\\rbrace _ { b } \\\\ & -\\left\\lbrace \\textbf{p}^{i},\\textbf{x}^{k } \\textbf{x}^{l } \\right\\rbrace _ { a } \\dfrac{2(e - h)}{(e - h)^{2}-\\omega^{2 } } \\left (   \\textbf{p}^{j } \\right)_{b}\\bigg ]    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if @xmath26 , this correction of quadrupole is proportional to @xmath39 .",
    "this correction is also different from the result in ref@xcite , which is proportional to @xmath41 .    in this section",
    ", we will study the two - loop contributions of bbr - shift , which can be obtained by add a virtual or thermal photon propagator to the fig.2(a ) .",
