    "quark confinement has been one of the most important long - standing issues remaining in theoretical physics @xcite since the concept of quarks was introduced in the 1960s . in fact , quarks can not be observed individually and are confined in color - singlet combinations of mesons or baryons . in particular , the nucleon , the lightest baryon , is one of the main ingredients of the matter in our real world , and , therefore , the quark confinement in baryons or three - quark ( 3q ) systems would be fairly important in modern physics , as well as in mesons or quark - antiquark ( q@xmath12 ) systems .",
    "furthermore , the three - body force among three quarks is a `` primary '' force reflecting the su(3 ) gauge symmetry in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite , while the three - body force appears as a residual interaction in most fields of physics .",
    "nevertheless , the quark interaction in baryonic 3q systems @xcite has not been investigated so much , in contrast with many lattice studies on q@xmath13 systems @xcite .    in su(3 )",

    "is called the y ansatz @xcite . these functional forms ( [ eq : cornell ] ) and ( [ eq : y - ansatz ] ) indicate the flux - tube picture @xcite on the confinement mechanism .",
    "in fact , the lattice qcd simulations @xcite on the action density in the presence of a static q@xmath13 or 3q system have actually shown the flux - tube formation ; that is , valence quarks are linked by the color flux tube as a quasi - one - dimensional object . here",
    ", the strength of quark confinement is controlled by the string tension of the flux tube , @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",

    ", width=325 ]    the difficulty in deriving quark confinement directly from qcd is considered to originate from non - abelian dynamics and nonperturbative features of qcd , which are quite different from the case of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",

    "as an interesting idea of quark confinement , nambu , t  hooft , and mandelstam proposed an abelian theory of the dual superconductor for the confinement mechanism @xcite in the 1970s . in the dual - superconductor picture ,",
    "the squeezing of the color - electric flux among quarks is realized by the dual meissner effect as the result of condensation of color - magnetic monopoles .",

    "mills theory @xcite . )    as for the possible connection between the dual superconductor and qcd , t  hooft proposed a concept of `` abelian projection '' as an infrared abelianization scheme of qcd @xcite , where the magnetic monopole topologically appears .",
    "and t  hooft also conjectured that long - distance physics such as confinement could be realized only by abelian degrees of freedom in qcd @xcite , which is called `` ( infrared ) abelian dominance '' .",
    "actually , in the maximally abelian ( ma ) gauge @xcite , qcd becomes abelian - like as a result of a large off - diagonal gluon mass of about 1gev @xcite , and the monopole current topologically appears @xcite .",
    "( see fig.[fig:2 ] . ) by using the hodge decomposition , the qcd vacuum can be divided into the monopole and the photon parts .",
    "the lattice qcd studies demonstrate that the monopole part has confinement @xcite , chiral symmetry breaking @xcite and instantons @xcite , while the photon part does not have all of them .         taken from ref .",

    ", there are very little studies about abelian dominance in the baryonic 3q potential @xcite because the previous lattice studies of abelian dominance were performed mainly for simplified su(2 ) color qcd , where the color structure of su(2 ) baryons ( qq ) are the same as that of mesons ( q@xmath13 ) . in a pioneering study , bornyakov  _ et  al . _",
