    "the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) , which is defined as the temperature change ( i.e. , as the cooling or heating ) of a magnetic system due to the application of an external magnetic field , has a long history in cooling applications at various temperature regimes  @xcite . since the first successful experiment of the adiabatic demagnetization performed in 1933  @xcite , the mce represents the standard technique for achieving the extremely low temperatures  @xcite . in this regard , theoretical predictions and descriptions of materials showing an enhanced mce create real opportunities for the effective selection of the construction for working magnetic - refrigeration devices",
    ". of particular interest is the investigation of the mce in various one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin models  @xcite and several coupled spin - electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the reason lies in a possibility of obtaining exact analytical or numerical results as well as in a potential use of these models for the explanation of mce data measured for real magnetic compounds .",
    "in particular , 1d models may give correct quantitative description of many real magnetic compounds when appropriate scaling of material parameters are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "in general , the mce is characterized by the isothermal entropy change ( @xmath3 ) and/or by the adiabatic temperature change  ( @xmath4 ) upon the magnetic field variation .",
    "depending on sings of these magnetocaloric potentials , the mce can be either conventional ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) or inverse ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) . in the former case the system cools down when the magnetic field is removed adiabatically , while in the latter case it heats up . whether the conventional mce or the inverse mce is present",
    "basically depends on the particular magnetic arrangement in the system  @xcite .",
    "namely , the former phenomenon can be observed in regular ferromagnets or paramagnets , while the latter one can be detected in ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials .",
    "moreover , coexistence of the above phenomena is also possible .",
    "both conventional and inverse mce can be found in magnetic systems with rich structure of the ground - state phase diagram , in particular , in various 1d models  @xcite , some multilayers  @xcite or even some finite structures  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will consider a double - tetrahedral chain , in which nodal lattice sites occupied by the localized ising spins regularly alternate with triangular clusters with the dynamics described by the hubbard model .",
    "note that this 1d spin - electron model can be rigorously solved by two distinct analytical approaches regardless of a number of mobile electrons in triangular clusters .",
    "the first approach is the standard transfer - matrix technique  @xcite , which is rather straightforward but applicable only to 1d systems .",
    "the second one lies in a combination of the generalized decoration - iteration mapping transformation  @xcite with the well known analytical results for the partition function of the spin-@xmath9 ising chain in a presence of the longitudinal magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in our recent works  @xcite , the coupled spin - electron double - tetrahedral chain provides an excellent prototype model with a rather complex ground state , which allows a rigorous theoretical investigation of the mce in a vicinity of the first - order phase transitions at non - zero magnetic fields .",
    "last but not least , it is valuable to mention the copper - based polymeric chain cu@xmath10mo@xmath11o@xmath12 , which represents a possible experimental realization of the double - tetrahedral chain structure  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the following two sections  [ sec:2 ] and  [ sec:3 ] , the model under investigation",
    "is defined and the corresponding hilbert space is organized for an exact analytical diagonalization of the block hamiltonian .",
    "subsequently , a particular ground - state analysis of the model is realized by using a complete set of eigenvalues of the block hamiltonian .",
    "sections  [ sec:4 ] and  [ sec:5 ] deal with the method used for rigorous analytical solution of the partition function and the most interesting numerical results for the magnetization , entropy and magnetocaloric properties of the model .",
    "finally , the most significant findings are briefly summarized in section  [ sec:5 ] .",

    "the hopping parameter @xmath26 takes into account the kinetic energy of mobile electrons delocalized over triangular clusters and @xmath27 stands for the ising - type coupling between mobile electrons and their nearest ising neighbors .",

    "to determine the ground state of the investigated 1d spin - electron model , it is sufficient to find the lowest - energy eigenstate of the block hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h_k ] ) , which can be simply extended to the whole double - tetrahedral chain due to the commuting character of different block hamiltonians .",

    "<S> ground - state and magnetocaloric properties of a double - tetrahedral chain , in which nodal lattice sites occupied by the localized ising spins regularly alternate with triangular clusters half filled with mobile electrons , are exactly investigated by using the transfer - matrix method in combination with the construction of the @xmath0th tensor power of the discrete fourier transformation . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the ground state of the model is formed by two non - chiral phases with the zero residual entropy and two chiral phases with the finite residual entropy @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the character of the exchange interaction between the localized ising spins and mobile electrons , one or three magnetization plateaus can be observed in the magnetization process . </S>",
    "<S> their heights basically depend on the values of land @xmath2-factors of the ising spins and mobile electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it is also evidenced that the system exhibits both the conventional and inverse magnetocaloric effect depending on values of the applied magnetic field and temperature .    </S>",
