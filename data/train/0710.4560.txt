    "one of the fundamental predictions of standard ( single - field , slow - roll ) inflationary cosmology is that the density fluctuations in the early universe that seeded large - scale structure formation were nearly gaussian random ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "constraining or detecting non - gaussianity ( ng ) is therefore an important and basic test of the cosmological model . to the extent that it can be measured ,",
    "gaussianity has so far been confirmed ; the tightest existing constraints have been obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "recently , several inflationary models have been proposed which predict a potentially observable level of nongaussianity , see @xcite and @xcite for a review .",
    "improved limits on ng would rule out some of these models ; conversely , a robust detection of primordial nongaussianity would dramatically overturn standard inflationary cosmology and provide invaluable information about the nature of physical processes in the early universe . in this regard",
    ", there has been a resurgence in studying increasingly more sophisticated methods and algorithms to constrain ( or , if we are lucky , detect ) nongaussianity @xcite .",
    "nongaussianity manifests itself not only in the cosmic microwave background @xcite , but also in the late - time evolution of large - scale structure .",
    "for example , detailed measurements of higher order correlations like the bispectrum or trispectrum of galaxy clustering could provide a handle on primordial nongaussianity @xcite .",
    "the abundance of galaxy clusters , the largest virialized objects in the universe , has also long been recognized as a sensitive probe of primordial ng @xcite . because clusters are rare objects which form from the largest fluctuations on the tails of the density probability distribution , their abundance is keenly sensitive to changes in the shape of the pdf such as those caused by nongaussianity .",
    "large statistical samples of massive clusters have already been compiled from wide - area optical imaging and spectroscopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , the two - degree survey @xcite , and from the red sequence survey @xcite and from x - ray surveys using the chandra and xmm - newton observatories @xcite .",
    "future missions , such as the dark energy survey , supernova / acceleration probe and large synoptic survey telescope , will detect and study tens of thousands of clusters , revolutionizing our understanding of cluster physics as well as providing important constraints on cosmology @xcite .    to exploit the potential of these upcoming surveys as probes of primordial nongaussianity ,",
    "it is important to calibrate the effects of ng on the abundance and clustering of virialized objects .",
    "while no previous work has attempted to quantify the effects of ng on halo clustering , several groups over the past decade have constructed fitting formulae for the halo mass function @xcite .",
    "all of this work , however , was analytic and relied on the validity of the press - schechter @xcite formalism , plus various further approximations",
    ". the resulting analytic estimates are , in general , rather cumbersome to compute and have questionable accuracy .",
    "as discussed below , the press - schechter model provides only a qualitative description of halo abundance , and fails to reproduce the halo mass function to within an order of magnitude over the mass and redshift range accessible to current and future cluster surveys .",
    "therefore , analytic models for ng cluster abundance based on the press - schechter ansatz may not be sufficiently accurate . given the high - quality data soon to be available , a much more precise calculation of cluster statistics will be required .",
    "quite recently , two groups have attempted to quantify the mass function of clusters in ng models using n - body simulations @xcite , reaching contradictory conclusions .    in this paper",
    ", we use analytic arguments and numerical simulations to estimate the effect of ng on the abundance and clustering of virialized objects .",
    "because n - body simulations can be expensive and there is a wide ng parameter space , we also strive to make our results useful to a cosmologist who is not necessarily equipped with the machinery or patience to run simulations or evaluate difficult analytic expressions . to this end",
    ", we provide a simple , physically motivated fitting formula for the halo mass function and halo bias , which we calibrate to our n - body simulations .",
    "our main results are that the mass function and correlation function of massive halos can be significantly modified by primordial nongaussianity .",
    "we find a somewhat weaker effect of ng on the mass function than previous analytic estimates .",
    "we also show analytically and numerically that ng strongly affects the clustering of rare objects on large scales , implying that measurements of the large - scale power spectrum can place stringent bounds on ng .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ anal ] we derive analytic expressions for the abundance and clustering of rare peaks . in section",
    "[ sec : method ] we describe our n - body simulations , followed in section [ sec : mf ] by a discussion of our measured halo mass function , and our fitting formula for the mass function . in section [ sec : pk ] we present measurements of halo clustering within our simulations , and in section [ sec : cosmo ] we discuss cosmological implications of our findings .",
    "in this section , we derive analytic expressions for the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos . as mentioned above , such analytic approaches provide a useful qualitative framework for understanding gravitational collapse , however they can not be used to describe quantitatively either the mass function or the clustering amplitude of collapsed objects .",
    "the expressions derived here are meant solely to motivate the more precise fitting formulae described in subsequent sections .",
    "we will focus on local ng of the form @xcite @xmath1 in our notation , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the usual newtonian potential . on subhorizon scales , this choice of newtonian gauge is valid , and the potentials @xmath4 and @xmath3 satisfy the poisson equation relating them to the overdensity @xmath5 . on superhorizon scales ,",
    "the bardeen potential @xmath4 and overdensity @xmath5 are proportional , and not related by a poisson equation , so our analysis will be valid only on subhorizon scales . with this choice of convention , positive",
    "@xmath6 corresponds to positive skewness of the density probability distribution , and hence an increased number of massive objects .    for simplicity , we neglect the effect of the cdm transfer functions , which modify the shape of the @xmath4 power spectrum after nongaussianity is generated .",
    "then the probability distribution for @xmath7 is easy to write down , however the probability distribution for the density @xmath8 can not be expressed analytically .",
    "nevertheless , we can make progress by assuming that the ng correction is small , and by focusing only on high peaks of the density .",
    "the laplacian of @xmath7 is @xmath9 .",
    "\\label{grad2phi}\\ ] ] because @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are all gaussian fields whose statistics are fully specified by their power spectra , then eqn .",
    "( [ grad2phi ] ) above , relating @xmath13 to the gaussian fields , allows us to determine fully the statistics of the nongaussian density @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the skewness of @xmath8 becomes , to lowest order in @xmath6 , @xmath14    on the average , the two terms @xmath15 and @xmath16 in eqn .",
    "( [ grad2phi ] ) are of the same order ; the fact that they have equal but opposite expectation value is why @xmath17 .",
    "however we are mainly interested in high peaks , where @xmath18 is large . because @xmath16 is uncorrelated with @xmath12 , and",
    "because at the peak of @xmath10 its derivative vanishes , we assume that @xmath16 may be neglected compared to @xmath15 in the vicinity of rare , high peaks .",
    "then applying the poisson equation near the peak gives @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "this expression applies for the primordial density and potential fields at early times . at late times",
    ", @xmath8 subsequently grows according to the linear growth factor @xmath20 , while the potential decays like @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , rewriting this expression in terms of the late - time fields , we find @xmath22 . \\label{dng}\\ ] ] we see that the peak height is enhanced by a factor proportional to the primordial potential @xmath23 , rather than the evolved potential . factor .",
    "we are grateful to n.  afshordi for pointing this out to us . ]",
    "equation  ( [ dng ] ) will be the basis for the rest of our discussion .",
    "we emphasize that this is only valid in the vicinity of peaks , and so we focus on peaks for the remainder of this discussion .",
    "because the fields @xmath5 and @xmath10 are gaussian distributed , we can immediately derive properties of the distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "for example , consider the mean shift in peak height for a peak of gaussian density @xmath5 : @xmath24 if the peak height @xmath5 and background potential @xmath10 were uncorrelated , then there would be no systematic shift in peak height , and hence no change in the abundance of massive halos .",
    "however , @xmath5 and @xmath10 are correlated , implying that rare peaks are systematically raised or lowered , depending upon the sign of @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , we expect changes in the mass function and the correlation function .    in the appendix , we derive expressions for the abundance and clustering of regions above a given threshold , which then give the clustering and mass function of halos in the press - schechter model .",
    "however , we can derive the form of the halo correlation function using a very simple argument .",
    "the halo correlation function is usually parameterized in terms of the halo bias @xmath25 , which is the rate of change of the halo abundance as the background density is varied .",
    "writing the matter overdensity as @xmath5 and the halo overdensity as @xmath26 , we can define the halo bias as @xmath27 it is normally assumed that @xmath28 const on large scales , but we will not make this assumption here . consider a long - wavelength mode , providing a background density perturbation @xmath5 and corresponding potential fluctuation @xmath10 . in the absence on nongaussianity , this perturbation raises subthreshold peaks above threshold , and thereby enhances the abundance of super - threshold peaks by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the usual ( gaussian ) lagrangian bias . for nonzero @xmath6 , the long - wavelength mode also enhances the peak height by @xmath31 , and we will focus on peaks near threshold , such that @xmath32 .",
    "this provides an additional enhancement factor , giving a total @xmath33 in fourier space , the potential and density modes are related by @xmath34 , and so we see that the nongaussian bias acquires a correction @xmath35 where again @xmath30 refers to the usual lagrangian bias for halos of this mass with gaussian fluctuations .",
    "the total lagrangian bias is then @xmath36 .    since we have been working with the clustering of peaks in the initial density distribution , the above expression for the bias applies only to the early - time , lagrangian bias .",
    "translating these results to late - time , eulerian bias is straightforward , however .",
    "the bias of eulerian halos is simply @xmath37 : the excess of halos in some eulerian volume with overdensity @xmath5 is @xmath38 .",
    "the first term corresponds to the excess of peaks in the initial lagrangian volume , which are advected into the eulerian volume .",
    "the second term arises because an eulerian volume with overdensity @xmath5 has @xmath5 times more mass than an average volume , and therefore @xmath5 times more peaks .    in summary ,",
    "local ng generates a scale - dependent correction to the bias of galaxies and halos , of the form @xmath39 where @xmath25 here now refers to the eulerian bias of the tracer population . in subsequent sections , we show that this simple expression , despite the underlying assumptions and approximations in its derivation , matches surprisingly well the halo clustering measured in our numerical simulations .",
    "we numerically simulate the growth of structure in nongaussian cosmologies using the adaptive p@xmath40 m parallel n - body code gracos @xcite .",
    "non - gaussian initial conditions were generated using the following procedure .",
    "first , we generated a gaussian random potential field @xmath41 using a power - law power spectrum with a scalar ( density ) index @xmath42 , and normalized so that @xmath43 @xcite when multiplied by the matter transfer function . following refs .",
    "@xcite , we then computed the nongaussian potential @xmath4 by adding a quadratic correction in configuration space , @xmath44 we then multiplied @xmath4 by matter transfer functions in fourier space for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and computed particle displacements and velocities using the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "one immediate drawback to this approach is that , due to the strong fourier mode coupling generated by the @xmath6 term , our results may be affected by the absence of modes below the fundamental frequency or above the nyquist frequency of our simulation volume .",
    "all n - body simulations can cover only a finite dynamic range , and therefore have zero power outside of their @xmath47-space volumes .",
    "for gaussian simulations , this is believed not to be a serious defect , because mode coupling is unimportant on linear scales , and on nonlinear scales , the mode coupling generally transfers power to small scales . in our case , however , the @xmath6 term couples all the modes sampled in our simulation to all the modes absent in our simulation . we have performed rudimentary estimates of the magnitude of this effect , by running simulations in which we high - pass or low - pass filter the @xmath6 correction , and do not observe significant changes in the overall behavior . strictly speaking ,",
    "however , it must be borne in mind that our results apply only for power spectra that are non - vanishing only over the finite range covered by our simulation volume .",
    "we have performed several simulations using both gaussian and nongaussian initial conditions . for each gaussian realization , we construct non - gaussian realizations using the same fourier phases , with various @xmath6 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we ran simulations from a starting expansion factor @xmath51 until the present time , @xmath52 , using @xmath53 particles in a box of sidelength @xmath54 mpc .",
    "for these parameters , each particle has a mass @xmath55 , so that clusters with masses exceeding @xmath56 are resolved with @xmath57 particles .",
    "since we are interested mainly in the masses and positions of cluster - sized halos , and not their internal structure , we have not used high force resolution : we employ a plummer softening length @xmath58 of 0.2 times the mean interparticle spacing .",
    "we have checked that using higher force resolution ( @xmath58 half as large ) does not appreciably change the mass function .",
    "all simulations were performed at the sunnyvale cluster at cita ; depending upon the value of @xmath6 , the simulations completed in 2 - 3 hours each on typically 8 - 10 nodes . as a consistency check , we have also run a small number of @xmath59 particle simulations with the same particle mass and force softening as above , but with twice the box size .",
    "these larger runs typically completed in 18 - 20 hours on 64 nodes . in figure",
    "[ fig : slice_sims ] , we plot slices through our simulation volume at redshift @xmath60 , and the effects of varying @xmath6 are readily apparent .",
    "large positive @xmath6 accelerates the evolution of overdense regions and retards the evolution of underdense regions , while large negative @xmath6 has precisely the opposite effect .",
    "we constructed late - time halo catalogues at redshifts @xmath61 , 0.5 , and 0 using the friends - of - friends group finder @xcite , with linking length @xmath62 .",
    "for gaussian simulations , the halo mass function constructed this way has been extensively calibrated @xcite .",
    "resulting mass functions are plotted in figure  [ fig : mf_warren ] .",
    "having measured the halo mass function , we next would like to construct a fitting function along the lines of those used for gaussian simulations @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , previous techniques for estimating the nongaussian mass function have been based upon the press - schechter @xcite ansatz .",
    "given that the press - schechter mass function fails to match the halo mass function to within an order of magnitude over the mass and redshift ranges of interest to us @xcite , and given the lack of any physical basis to the press - schechter ansatz @xcite , we have instead adopted an alternative approach which we describe next .",
    "we start by noting that the halo mass function @xmath63 has been precisely calibrated for gaussian cosmologies .",
    "consider a gaussian realization of the density field , which at late times evolves to produce halos with mass function @xmath64 .",
    "as we slowly vary @xmath6 away from zero , the structures forming at late times also slowly vary ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : slice_sims ] ) , producing a different mass spectrum @xmath65 .",
    "if we vary @xmath6 slowly enough , we can track the change in mass and position for individual halos : i.e. , for each halo of mass @xmath66 for @xmath67 , we can uniquely identify a corresponding halo of mass @xmath68 for @xmath69 , as long as @xmath70 is sufficiently small .",
    "since we know precisely the number of halos as a function of @xmath66 , if we can determine the mapping @xmath71 , we will then have an estimate of the non - gaussian mass function @xmath65 via    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the probability distribution that a gaussian halo of mass @xmath66 maps to a non - gaussian halo of mass @xmath68 .",
    "note that the probability distribution function @xmath74 need not integrate to unity , @xmath75 in general , since the total number of halos is not conserved : halos can merge or split as @xmath6 is varied .",
    "the next step is to determine the probability distribution @xmath73 , by matching halos between gaussian and non - gaussian simulations .",
    "we match halos by requiring that matching pairs have significantly overlapping lagrangian volumes ; i.e.  by requiring that halos have many particles in common , where particles are labeled by their lagrangian coordinates in the initial conditions . for each halo @xmath68 in a non - gaussian run , we loop over the halo s particles and identify which gaussian halos own those particles in the run with @xmath67 . the gaussian halo owning the largest fraction ( exceeding 1/3 ) of the particles is then identified as the match for non - gaussian halo @xmath68 .",
    "each gaussian halo @xmath66 can have one , several , or zero matching non - gaussian halos , depending on @xmath6 . by stacking gaussian halos of similar mass @xmath66",
    ", we can determine @xmath73 .",
    "examples of the probability distribution are shown in figure  [ fig : pdf_compare ] , and the mean and variance of the pdf are plotted in figure  [ fig : scatter_mean_rms ] .",
    "the behavior of the mean @xmath76 and variance are quite regular , and appear consistent with simple power laws : -1 & = & 1.3  10 ^ -4f_nl_8(m_0,z)^-2 [ eq : mean_mf_def ] + var ( ) & = & 1.4  10 ^ -4 ( f_nl_8)^0.8 ( m_0,z)^-1 , [ eq : rms_mf_def ] where the rms overdensity dispersion @xmath77 is defined as usual by @xmath78 where we use a top - hat window @xmath79 for @xmath80 , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the matter power spectrum and energy density respectively .    because we desire a simple fitting formula",
    ", we assume that we can approximate the pdf as a normalized gaussian whose mean and variance are given above , even though the pdf shape is quite clearly nongaussian ( c.f.figure  [ fig : pdf_compare ] ) . as we show below , however , even this crude approximation is sufficient to achieve the @xmath83 precision in the halo mass function provided by standard fitting formulae for gaussian simulations @xcite",
    ". then eq .",
    "( [ eq : mf_conv ] ) , together with @xmath73 which is assumed to be a gaussian with the mean and variance given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mean_mf_def ] ) and ( [ eq : rms_mf_def ] ) , fully specify our fitting function .",
    "essentially , we have written the ng mass function as a convolution of the gaussian mass function with a gaussian kernel .      before showing a comparison of the simulated mass function to our proposed fitting formula , we first describe alternative fitting formulae previously suggested in the literature : the extended press - schechter ( eps ) formalism @xcite , and the model of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter mvj ) .",
    "the eps formalism generalizes the widely used press - schechter @xcite model , which posits that the fraction of mass in collapsed objects is equal to _ twice _ the fraction of the volume occupied by density peaks exceeding some critical overdensity @xmath84 .",
    "( the factor of two arises from the so - called ` cloud - in - cloud ' problem @xcite . )",
    "therefore the collapsed fraction becomes @xmath85 where the probability distribution @xmath86 that the density smoothed on mass scale @xmath87 equals @xmath5 is simply @xmath88 , the gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance for @xmath89 , with @xmath90 given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath91 for hierarchical cosmologies where @xmath90 diverges as @xmath92 ; that is , _ all _ matter is assumed to be in virialized objects of some mass .    the differential mass function may then be readily computed : @xmath93 for a gaussian pdf , the mass @xmath87 enters the right - hand side of this expression only via the lower bound of the integral , @xmath94 , so we immediately obtain @xmath95 this gives the well - known press - schechter mass function .    a class of fitting formulae based on this approach , and loosely called ` extended press - schechter ' ( though apparently unrelated to the work of refs.@xcite ) attempt to generalize this argument using nongaussian pdfs .",
    "the most obvious way of making this generalization , i.e.  inserting the nongaussian pdf @xmath96 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndm_f(m ) ] ) , faces several immediate difficulties , however .",
    "first , the press - schechter factor of 2 is no longer valid ; rather the cloud - in - cloud correction will depend upon the specific form of nongaussianity .",
    "second , the shape of the pdf @xmath86 now depends upon @xmath87 and so we can not simply replace the derivative of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dndm_f(m ) ] ) by the integrand .",
    "lastly , and prosaically , the press - schechter mass function does not , in fact , fit the halo mass function in n - body simulations well , and so starting from ps is guaranteed to fail in fitting the nongaussian mass function .",
    "the approach adopted by many previous workers ( e.g.  @xcite ) has instead been to assume that , although press - schechter can not be used to derive the gaussian mass function , it may be used to compute the departure of the mass function from its gaussian value , i.e. @xmath97 where @xmath98 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : f(m ) ] ) . in this approach ,",
    "the nongaussian mass function is computed by multiplying the gaussian mass function ( not press - schechter , but @xcite or @xcite ) by the above ratio .",
    "the eps prediction for the halo mass function is therefore given by the derivatives of the pdf tails given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) above . to implement this prescription ,",
    "we compute the pdf tails directly from the initial conditions of our simulations : at each redshift we are interested in , we integrate the linearly evolved pdf to compute @xmath99 at masses ranging from about @xmath100 to @xmath101 . then we compute the mean value of @xmath99 averaged over 10 independent n - body simulations .",
    "finally , we fit a cubic spline through the ( computed mean of ) @xmath102 and differentiate with respect to mass .",
    "evaluation of this formula becomes extremely difficult at high masses , simply because the statistics of peaks at these high masses becomes too noisy .",
    "the mvj @xcite mass function is a further approximation to the eps model described above .",
    "instead of numerically computing the pdf and its tails for each @xmath6 , it is assumed that the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) may be determined from the skewness of the pdf .",
    "the expression for the mass function becomes @xcite    @xmath103 & & \\left [ { 1\\over 6}{\\delta_*^3\\over \\delta_c}\\left |{ds_{3 , m}\\over d\\ln m}\\right | +    \\delta _ * \\left |{d\\sigma_m\\over d\\ln m}\\right | \\right ] \\nonumber \\label{eq : mvj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath104 s_{3 , m } & \\equiv & { \\langle \\delta^3\\rangle_m\\over \\langle\\delta^2\\rangle_m^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is @xmath106th moment of the density field evaluated on the characteristic mass scale @xmath87 , and @xmath107 is the skewness on that mass scale .",
    "the advantage of the mvj formula is that it does not require specification of the pdf of the density field  however , it does require knowledge of the skewness @xmath107 . in this work , we compute the moments of the density field directly from our simulations at the starting epoch @xmath51 , then scale them with the linear growth function to the desired epoch .",
    "we can then evaluate the mvj expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mvj ] ) . unlike the eps approach described above",
    ", the formula does not become intractable at high masses . on the other hand ,",
    "mvj becomes onerously expensive to calculate at low levels of nongaussianity ( e.g.  @xmath108 ) , simply because the scatter in the measured skewness from run to run becomes comparable to that generated by primordial nongaussianity . to see this , note that the scatter in @xmath109 is roughly @xmath110 for @xmath111 samples .",
    "approximating @xmath112 , then for a @xmath53 grid and mass scale of 200 cells , and taking @xmath113 , requiring @xmath114 translates into @xmath115 .",

    "[ fig : mf_compare_abs ] . ]",
    ", they both overestimate the effects of nongaussianity as found by our simulations , at a level typically @xmath124 although dependent upon mass and redshift .",
    "this result appears to disagree with the work of @xcite , who find a large discrepancy between eps / mvj and their simulations mass function , in the sense that their simulations show a much _ larger _ effect of nongaussianity than predicted by the eps type formalism .",
    "however , as noted by these authors , their simulations used a rather small number of particles ( @xmath125 ) in a volume nearly 20@xmath126 smaller than ours , so it is unclear how well they probe the statistics of the rare objects of interest to us .",
    "in contrast , @xcite have found very good agreement between the mvj formula and their simulations results .",
    "while our fitting function is in mild disagreement with the mvj fitting formula , it is unclear whether our simulations are in disagreement with the simulations of @xcite .",
    "their simulations used a somewhat different cosmological model ( higher @xmath127 ) than ours , they have plotted cumulative rather than differential mass functions , and of course the error bars in both their plots and ours are considerable .    in summary , we conclude that our simple fitting function appears consistent with the measured mass function from our simulations to within @xmath128 over the entire range of masses and redshifts that we consider .",
    "since this is the level of precision that various n - body codes agree with each other in the mass function @xcite , we have not attempted to achieve better agreement .",
    "eps - like fitting formulae , such as the model of mvj @xcite , appear to overestimate the effects of nongaussianity .",
    "the level of discrepancy increases with increasing mass and redshift .",
    "beyond one - point statistics like the halo mass function , n - body simulations also allow us to compute higher order statistics like the correlation function or its fourier transform , the power spectrum . as shown in sec .",
    "[ ng_analytic ] , we expect nongaussianity to produce pronounced effects on the halo power spectrum , specifically in the form of scale - dependent halo bias on large scales . this may seem somewhat surprising , due to very general arguments previously given in the literature that galaxy bias is expected to be independent of scale in the linear regime @xcite .",
    "we can summarize the argument as follows .",
    "suppose that the halo overdensity is some deterministic function of the local matter overdensity , @xmath129 . on large scales ,",
    "where @xmath130 , we can taylor expand this function , @xmath131 .",
    "keeping only the lowest order terms and requiring that @xmath132 then gives @xmath133 , which is linear deterministic bias .",
    "the key assumption in this argument was locality ; i.e. that the halo abundance is determined entirely by the local matter density . n - body simulations with gaussian initial conditions have confirmed that halo bias tends to a constant on large scales well in the linear regime .",
    "once we allow for primordial nongaussianity , however , the above argument need not hold .",
    "for example , in this paper we have considered ng of the form @xmath134 , and note that the gravitational potential is a nonlocal quantity .",
    "hence the locality - based argument above does not apply for this form of nongaussianity , and our derived scale - dependence of the bias is not surprising .",
    "the specific form we have derived is particular to the quadratic , local form of ng that we have assumed , however we expect any ng that couples density modes with potential modes will in general lead to scale - dependent bias . on the other hand , nongaussianity of the form @xmath135",
    "does not lead to scale - dependent bias .    in order to test our prediction for the scale dependence of bias ,",
    "we have computed halo bias in our n - body simulations by taking the ratio of the matter power spectrum @xmath136 and the halo - matter cross spectrum @xmath137 .",
    "we have used the cross spectrum rather than the halo auto spectrum because the former should be less sensitive to shot noise from the small number of halos compared to dm particles .",
    "we have checked , however , that using the halo auto - spectra to compute bias gives consistent results as the cross - spectra ; i.e.we find no evidence for stochasticity .",

    "we focus on galaxy cluster surveys and redshift surveys .",
    "cluster surveys aim to constrain cosmological parameters , in particular dark energy parameters , by exploiting the exponential sensitivity of the galaxy cluster abundance on cosmology .",
    "similarly , a major goal for upcoming redshift surveys is to constrain dark energy by localizing baryonic acoustic oscillation ( bao ) features in the galaxy power spectrum at multiple redshifts .",
    "examples of upcoming surveys include the atacama cosmology telescope , south pole telescope , dark energy survey , wigglez , planck , supernova / acceleration probe , and the large synoptic survey telescope .",
    "because primordial nongaussianity affects both the abundance and power spectra of massive halos , both of these types of surveys will be well - suited for constraining ng .",
    "on the other hand , potential ng could in principle degrade the expected constraints on dark energy parameters , due to possible degeneracies .",
    "we use the fisher matrix formalism to extract errors on seven cosmological parameters as well as @xmath6 .",
    "our estimates are only illustrative ; accurate forecasts for specific surveys will require a more sophisticated analysis .",
    "we can ( crudely ) estimate constraints on parameters @xmath139 derived from measurements of the power spectrum by assuming that bandpowers are measured with errors @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the power in a band of width @xmath142 centered at wavenumber @xmath47 , @xmath106 is the number density of galaxies , and @xmath143 is the number of independent fourier modes sampled by the survey , roughly given by @xmath144 @xcite .",

    "we believe the @xmath150 used here is optimistic but reasonable . at high @xmath47 ( small scales ) , late - time nonlinear evolution can also generate scale - dependent bias @xcite , however the redshift and scale dependence of this effect is quite distinctive from ng and we ignore it here .",
    "we assume that the target galaxies have properties similar to luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite , with comoving number density @xmath151 and bias @xmath152 .",
    "equation  ( [ fishy_pk ] ) then gives estimated errors on @xmath6 of @xmath153 , which compares well with forecasted constraints on nongaussianity for planck .",
    "unsurprisingly , we find little degeneracy between @xmath6 and other cosmological parameters , given its distinctive effect on the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "accordingly , there is little reason to believe that bao determinations of dark energy parameters will be biased by nongaussianity , especially since the scale dependence is small over the wavenumbers of interest for the bao wiggles . to quantify this effect we determine the acoustic peak position by looking at extrema of the ratio of the power spectra with baryons and the power spectrum with zero baryons @xcite . when multiplying the matter power spectrum with baryons by our scale dependant bias , we find that @xmath154 would shift the first bao peak at @xmath155mpc by 0.4% at @xmath61 , and has a considerably smaller effect at the higher bao peaks .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is comparable to the effect of non - linear corrections to the power spectrum @xcite , although the ng effect is primarily important on large scales while nonlinearities are most important on small scales . in principle ,",
    "ng and nonlinearities could conspire to lead to a @xmath156 bias in the dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath157 inferred from bao observations @xcite , and so a careful joint analysis allowing both for ng and nonlinear corrections will be required , which should not be difficult .",
    "another probe of @xmath158 on large scales is the cross - correlation between cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies and large scale structure , due to the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect @xcite .",
    "first detections of the isw effect from cross - correlations of wmap with various large scale surveys have been obtained with reported detections at the 2 - 4@xmath159 level @xcite .",
    "a combined analysis yields a @xmath160 detection @xcite , whereas a cosmic variance limited measurement would allow a @xmath161 detection for the currently favored @xmath162cdm cosmology , and a somewhat more significant detection if the dark energy equation of state parameter is smaller @xcite .",
    "the cross - correlation between large - scale structure and cmb is directly proportional to a weighted projection of the scale - dependant bias .",
    "since the @xmath163 and @xmath47 dependence of our bias is very specific , we do not expect it to be severely degenerate with other parameters affecting the amplitude of the isw effect ( mostly @xmath157 and @xmath164 for a flat universe ) .",
    "we can thus translate the isw detection level into constraints on @xmath6 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume that the isw signal comes from @xmath165 and is dominated by the angular multipole @xmath166 , corresponding to a wavenumber @xmath167mpc at @xmath168 @xcite . according to eq .",
    "( [ bias_eul ] ) the current @xmath169 ( @xmath170 ) detections of isw translate into upper limits on @xmath70 of 123 ( 61 ) ( 1@xmath159 ) assuming a bias @xmath152 , as appropriate for lrgs @xcite .",

    "isw or bao observations could provide somewhat weaker bounds on @xmath6 , though of course any constraints they can provide would be independent of the cmb bispectrum and therefore worthwhile .",

    "] we assume no mass information ( which would improve our parameter constraints ) but also no systematic errors ( which would degrade the constraints ) .",
    "lastly , we add a planck prior on the parameter set , neglecting forecasted constraints on @xmath6 expected from future cmb bispectrum measurements ( since we are interested in the sensitivity to ng of cluster counts alone ) .",

    "moreover , even though we use the average of the nongaussian pdf tail over 10 simulations , the eps result becomes noisy at @xmath215 due to poor sampling of the tails .",
    "the magnitude of the discrepancy between eps estimates and our simulations appears similar even for the higher @xmath185 model . as with our estimates from power spectrum constraints",
    ", we do not find significant degeneracies between @xmath6 and other cosmological parameters ( correlation coefficient @xmath216 ) .    since we find a weaker effect on cluster abundance than previous formulae like eps or mvj",
    ", this implies that constraints found by @xcite , who performed a similar fisher matrix estimate but with somewhat different assumptions , will be weaker once the ng sensitivity is calibrated off simulations .",
    "direct quantitative comparison to two other relevant papers , @xcite and @xcite , is however difficult since these authors do not compute cosmological parameter error estimates .",
    "we have quantified the effects of primordial nongaussianity on the abundance and power spectra of massive halos .",
    "our two principal results are as follows .",
    "first , we have provided a new fitting formula for the halo mass function .",
    "the formula is based on matching halos in gaussian and non - gaussian simulations : for @xmath122 the corresponding halos are more massive than in the gaussian case , and vice versa .",
    "the formula is consistent with the measured mass function from our simulations to within @xmath128 over the entire range of masses and redshifts that we consider .",
    "being essentially a convolution of the gaussian mass function and a gaussian kernel ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mf_conv])-([eq : rms_mf_def ] ) ) , the formula is also easy to use and does not require estimating the extreme tails of the nongaussian pdf of the density field . our results also indicate that previous work based on extended press - schechter type formulae overestimated the effects of nongaussianity on the abundance of halos by a factor of @xmath217 over the relevant mass scales .",
    "secondly , we showed both analytically and numerically that nongaussianity ( in the @xmath6 model ) leads to strong scale dependence of the bias of dark matter halos .",
    "we find remarkably good agreement between our analytic expression and our numerical results .",
    "measurement of the power spectrum of biased objects therefore provides a new avenue to detect and measure nongaussianity .",
    "while cluster counts can constrain ng at a level comparable to existing cmb constraints , @xmath218 , we found that future large - scale redshift surveys can potentially do much better , roughly @xmath0 .",
    "we do not find significant degeneracies between @xmath6 and dark energy parameters in our fisher matrix calculations , either for mass function measurements or power spectrum measurements .",
    "more precise estimates will require considerably more sophisticated treatments than we have attempted in our illustrative examples above .",
    "we close this paper by considering , in light of our findings , the optimal methods for constraining ng of the @xmath6 form .",
    "measurements of the power spectrum would appear the most promising ; observations of high redshift , highly clustered objects on large scales would allow the strongest constraints on the scale - dependent bias signature of @xmath6 .",
    "fortunately , upcoming bao surveys will likely provide the necessary observations of , e.g. luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) .",
    "photometric surveys may also be useful in this regard .",
    "since the effects of ng are most pronounced on large scales , rather than small scales , precise spectroscopic redshifts may not be necessary .",
    "photometric redshifts with errors of order @xmath219 have already been achieved for lrgs and for optically selected groups and clusters with prominent red sequences @xcite . at @xmath119 ,",
    "this corresponds to roughly 100 @xmath220mpc comoving , fairly small compared to the @xmath174gpc scales where ng becomes most important . since photometric surveys can cover wider areas more deeply than spectroscopic surveys",
    ", they may turn out to provide tighter bounds .",
    "besides their abundance and clustering , the internal properties of massive halos may also be sensitive to nongaussianity .",
    "for instance , the concentrations and substructure content of massive halos have been found to depend upon primordial ng @xcite .",
    "our simulations lacked sufficient force resolution to explore this in detail , but we note in passing that multiple groups find a tension between observations of massive lensing clusters and theoretical predictions for gaussian perturbations @xcite .",
    "another intriguing possibility for probing primordial ng is to use statistics of the largest voids in the universe . just as the abundance and clustering of high density peaks",
    "are affected by nongaussianity , so are the same properties for deep voids ( albeit with an opposite sign , c.f.fig .",
    "[ fig : slice_sims ] ) . in a sense , because voids are not as nonlinear as overdense regions , their properties are more easily related to the initial lagrangian underdensities whose statistics are straightforward to compute",
    ". voids may be detected at high redshift as a deficit of lyman-@xmath221 forest absorption features in qso spectra .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has already measured spectra for high redshift qso s over a roughly @xmath1748000 deg@xmath222 area , corresponding to a volume of @xmath223 @xcite .",
    "each qso spectrum typically probes @xmath224 mpc , and the typical transverse separation between qso sightlines in sdss is @xmath225 mpc , ( p.  mcdonald , priv.comm . )",
    "so measurements of the clustering of @xmath226 mpc - sized voids on @xmath174 gpc scales may already be feasible .",
    "finally , we note that our conclusions are based on simulations implementing a very specific type of local primordial nongaussianity quantified by the @xmath6 parameter .",
    "the validity of our conclusions in the context of other type of primordial nongaussianity is the subject of ongoing studies .",
