    "perhaps the ultimate hope for physicists is that we will one day discover what is jocularly referred to as a _",
    "toe _ , a  theory of everything \" , an all - embracing and self - consistent physical theory that summarizes everything that there is to know about the workings of the physical world .",
    "almost all physicists would undoubtedly agree that such a theory is still conspicuous with its absence , although the agreement is probably poorer on the issue of what would qualify as a toe .",
    "although the requirements that    * it should be a self - consistent theory encompassing quantum field theory and general relativity as special cases and * it should have predictive power so as to be falsifiable in popper s sense    are hardly controversial , it is far from clear which of our experimental results we should expect it to predict with certainty and which it should predict only in a statistical sense .",
    "for instance , should we expect it to predict the masses of the elementary particles ( measured in dimensionless planck units , say ) from first principles , are these masses free parameters in the theory , or do they arise from some symmetry - breaking process that can produce a number of distinct outcomes so that the toe for all practical purposes merely predicts a probability distribution @xcite ?",
    "let us divide toes into two categories depending on their answer to the following question : is the physical world purely mathematical , or is mathematics merely a useful tool that approximately describes certain aspects of the physical world ?",
    "more formally , _ is the physical world isomorphic to some mathematical structure ? _ for instance , if it were not for quantum phenomena and the problem of describing matter in classical theories , a tenable toe in the first category would be one stating that the physical world was isomorphic to a 3 + 1-dimensional pseudo - riemannian manifold , on which a number of tensor fields were defined and obeyed a certain system of partial differential equations .",
    "thus the broad picture in a category 1 toe is this :    * there are one or more mathematical structures that exist not only in the mathematical sense , but in a physical sense as well .",
    "* self - aware substructures ( sass ) might inhabit some of these structures , and we humans are examples of such sass .    in other words , some subset of all mathematical structures ( see for examples ) is endowed with an elusive quality that we call physical existence , or _",
    "pe _ for brevity . specifying this subset thus specifies a category 1 toe . since there are three disjoint possibilities ( none , some or all mathematical structures have pe ) , we obtain the following classification scheme :    1 .",
    "the physical world is completely mathematical . 1 .",
    "everything that exists mathematically exists physically .",
    "some things that exist mathematically exist physically , others do not .",
    "nothing that exists mathematically exists physically .",
    "the physical world is not completely mathematical .",
    "the beliefs of most physicists probably fall into categories 2 ( for instance on religious grounds ) and 1b .",
    "category 2 toes are somewhat of a resignation in the sense of giving up physical predictive power , and will not be further discussed here .",
    "the obviously ruled out category 1c toe was only included for completeness . toes in the popular category 1b",
    "are vulnerable to the criticism ( made by wheeler @xcite , nozick @xcite and weinberg @xcite ) that they leave an important question unanswered : why is that particular subset endowed with pe , not another ?    what breaks the symmetry between mathematical structures that would a priori appear to have equal merit ?",
    "for instance , take the above - mentioned category 1b toe of classical general relativity .",
    "then why should one set of initial conditions have pe when other similar ones do not ? why should the mathematical structure where the electron / proton mass ratio @xmath2 have pe when the one with @xmath3 does not ? and why should a 3 + 1-dimensional manifold have pe when a 17 + 5-dimensional one does not ? in summary , although a category 1b toe may one day turn out to be correct , it may come to appear somewhat arbitrary and thus perhaps disappointing to scientists hoping for a toe that elegantly answers all outstanding questions and leaves no doubt that it really is the ultimate toe .    in this paper",
    ", we propose that category 1a is the correct one .",
    "this is akin to what has been termed _ ",
    "the principle of fecundity \" _ @xcite , that all logically acceptable worlds exist , although as will become clear in the discussion of purely formal mathematical structures in section  [ mesec ] , the 1a toe involves no difficult - to - define vestige of human language such as  logically acceptable \" in its definition .",
    "1a can also be viewed as a form of radical platonism , asserting that the mathematical structures in plato s _ realm of ideas _",
    ", the _ mindscape _ of rucker @xcite , exist `` out there '' in a physical sense @xcite , akin to what barrow refers to as `` pi in the sky '' @xcite .",
    "since 1a is ( as 1c ) a completely specified theory , involving no free parameters whatsoever , it is in fact a candidate for a toe .",
    "although it may at first appear as though 1a is just as obviously ruled out by experience as 1c , we will argue that this is in fact far from clear .",
    "how does one make quantitative predictions using the 1a toe ? in _ any _ theory , we can make quantitative predictions in the form of probability distributions by using bayesean statistics . for instance , to predict the classical period @xmath4 of a foucault pendulum , we would use the equation t= 2 . using probability distributions to model the errors in our measurements of the length @xmath5 and the local gravitational acceleration @xmath6 ,",
    "we readily compute the probability distribution for @xmath4 .",
    "usually we only care about the mean @xmath7 and the standard deviation @xmath8 (  the error bars \" ) , and as long as @xmath9 , we get the mean by inserting the means in and @xmath10 from the standard expression for the propagation of errors .",
    "in addition to the propagated uncertainty in the prior observations , the nature of the mathematical structure itself might add some uncertainty , as is the case in quantum mechanics . in the language of the previous section ,",
    "both of these sources of uncertainty reflect our lack of knowledge as to which of the many sass in the mathematical structure corresponds to the one making the experiment : imperfect knowledge of field quantities ( like @xmath6 ) corresponds to uncertainty as to where in the spacetime manifold one is , and quantum uncertainty stems from lack of knowledge as to which branch of the wavefunction one is in ( after the measurement ) .    in the 1a toe ,",
    "there is a third source of uncertainty as well : we do not know exactly which mathematical structure we are part of , , where we are in a hypothetical expansion of containing all structures .",
    "clearly , we can eliminate many options as inconsistent with our observations ( indeed , many can of course be eliminated _ a priori _ as  dead worlds \" containing no sass at all  for instance , all structures in are presumably too simple to contain sass ) .",
    "if we could examine all of them , and some set of mathematical structures remained as candidates , then they would each make a prediction for the form of , leaving us with a probability distribution as to which equation to use . including this uncertainty in the probability calculation",
    "would then give us our predicted mean and error bars .",
    "although this prescription may sound unfamiliar , it is quite analogous to what we do all the time .",
    "we usually imagine that the fine structure constant @xmath11 has some definite value in the mathematical structure that describes our world ( or at least a value where the fundamental uncertainty is substantially smaller than the measurement errors in our current best estimate , @xmath12 ) . to reflect our measurement errors on @xmath11 ,",
    "we therefore calculate error bars as if there were an entire ensemble of possible theories , spanning a small range of @xmath11-values .",
    "indeed , this bayesean procedure has already been applied to ensembles of theories with radically different values of physical constants @xcite . according to the 1a toe",
    ", we must go further and include our uncertainty about other aspects of the mathematical structure as well , for instance , uncertainty as to which equations to use .",
    "however , this is also little different from what we do anyway , when searching for alternative models .      since the above prescription was found to be so similar to the conventional one",
    ", we must address the following question : can the 1a toe be distinguished from the others in practice , or is this entire discussion merely a useless metaphysical digression ?    as discussed above , the task of any theory is to compute probability distributions for the outcomes of future experiments given our previous observations . since the correspondence between the mathematical structure and everyday concepts such as  experiment \" and  outcome \" can be quite subtle ( as will be discussed at length in section  [ predictionsec ] ) , it is more appropriate to rephrase this as follows : given the subjective perceptions of a sas , a theory should allow us to compute probability distributions for ( at least certain quantitative aspects of ) its future perceptions .",
    "since this calculation involves summing over _ all _ mathematical structures , the 1a toe makes the following two predictions that distinguish it from the others categories :    * * prediction 1 : * the mathematical structure describing our world is the most generic one that is consistent with our observations . *",
    "* prediction 2 : * our observations are the most generic ones that are consistent with our existence .    in both cases , we are referring to the totality of all observations that we have made so far in our life .",
    "the nature of the set of all mathematical structures ( over which we need some form of measure to formalize what we mean by generic ) will be discussed at length in section  [ mesec ] .",
    "these two predictions are of quite different character .",
    "the first one offers both a useful guide when searching for the ultimate structure ( if the 1a toe is correct ) and a way of predicting experimental results to potentially rule out the 1a toe , as described in section  [ predictionsec ] .",
    "the second one is not practically useful , but provides many additional ways of potentially ruling the theory out .",
    "for instance , the structure labeled  general relativity \" in contains the rather arbitrary number 3 as the dimensionality of space .",
    "since manifolds of arbitrarily high dimensionality constitute equally consistent mathematical structures , a 3-dimensional one is far from  generic \" and would have measure zero in this family of structures .",
    "the observation that our space appears three - dimensional would therefore rule out the 1a toe if the alternatives were not inconsistent with the very existence of sass .",
    "intriguingly , as discussed in section  [ islandsec ] , all higher dimensionalities _ do _ appear to be inconsistent with the existence of sass , since among other things , they preclude stable atoms .",
    "yes , marginally : the weak anthropic principle must be taken into account when trying to rule the theory out based on prediction 2 .",
    "prediction 2 implies that the 1a toe is ruled out if there is anything about the observed universe that is surprising , given that we exist .",
    "so is it ruled out ?",
    "for instance , the author has no right to be surprised about facts that _ a priori _ would seem unlikely , such as that his grandparents happened to meet or that the spermatozoid carrying half of his genetic makeup happened to come first in a race agains millions of others , as long as these facts are necessary for his existence .",
    "likewise , we humans have no right to be surprised that the coupling constant of the strong interaction , @xmath13 , is not @xmath14 larger than it is , for if it were , the sun would immediately explode ( the diproton would have a bound state , which would increase the solar luminosity by a factor @xmath15 @xcite ) .",
    "this rather tautological ( but often overlooked ) statement that we have no right to be surprised about things necessary for our existence has been termed _",
    "the weak anthropic principle _ @xcite .",
    "in fact , investigation of the effects of varying physical parameters has gradually revealed that @xcite    * _ virtually no physical parameters can be changed by large amounts without causing radical qualitative changes to the physical world . _    in other words ,",
    "the  island \" in parameter space that supports human life appears to be quite small .",
    "this smallness is an embarrassment for toes in category 1b , since such toes provide no answer to the pressing question of why the mathematical structures possessing pe happen to belong to that tiny island , and has been hailed as support for religion - based toes in category 2 .",
    "such  design arguments \" @xcite stating that the world was designed by a divine creator so as to contain sass are closely related to what is termed the _ strong anthropic principle _",
    "@xcite , which states that the universe must support life .",
    "the smallness of the island has also been used to argue in favor of various ensemble theories in category 1b , since if structures with pe cover a large region of parameter space , it is not surprising if they happen to cover the island as well .",
    "the same argument of course supports our 1a toe as well , since it in fact predicts that structures on this island ( as well as all others ) have pe .    in conclusion ,",
    "when comparing the merits of toe 1a and the others , it is important to calculate which aspects of the physical world are necessary for the existence of sass and which are not .",
    "any clearly demonstrated feature of  fine tuning \" which is unnecessary for the existence of sass would immediately rule out the 1a toe .",
    "for this reason , we will devote section  [ islandsec ] to exploring the  local neighborhood \" of mathematical structures , to see by how much our physical world can be changed without becoming uninhabitable .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ mesec ] discusses which structures exist mathematically , which defines the grand ensemble of which our world is assumed to be a member .",
    "section [ predictionsec ] discusses how to make physical predictions using the 1a toe .",
    "it comments on the subtle question of how mathematical structures are perceived by sass in them , and proposes criteria that mathematical structures should satisfy in order to be able to contain sass .",
    "section  [ islandsec ] uses the three proposed criteria to map out our local island of habitability , discussing the effects of varying physical constants , the dimensionality of space and time , finally , our conclusions are summarized in section [ conclusionssec ] .",
    "our proposed toe can be summarized as follows :    * _ physical existence is equivalent to mathematical existence . _    what precisely is meant by mathematical existence , or _ me _ for brevity ?",
    "a generally accepted interpretation of me is that of david hilbert :    * _ mathematical existence is merely freedom from contradiction . _    in other words , if the set of axioms that define a mathematical structure can not be used to prove both a statement and its negation , then the mathematical structure is said to have me .",
    "the purpose of this section is to remind the non - mathematician reader of the purely formal foundations of mathematics , clarifying how extensive ( and limited ) the  ultimate ensemble \" of physical worlds really is , thereby placing nozick s notion @xcite of  all logically acceptable worlds \" on a more rigorous footing .",
    "the discussion is centered around . by giving examples",
    ", we will illustrate the following points :    * the notion of a mathematical structure is well - defined . *",
    "although a rich variety of structures enjoy mathematical existence , the variety is limited by the requirement of self - consistency and by the identification of isomorphic ones .",
    "* mathematical structures are  emergent concepts \" in a sense resembling that in which physical structures ( say classical macroscopic objects ) are emergent concepts in physics .",
    "* it appears likely that the most basic mathematical structures that we humans have uncovered to date are the same as those that other sass would find . *",
    "symmetries and invariance properties are more the rule than the exception in mathematical structures .      for a more rigorous and detailed introduction to formal systems ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to pedagogical books on the subject such as @xcite .",
    "the mathematics that we are all taught in school is an example of a formal system , albeit usually with rather sloppy notation . to a logician , a _ formal system _",
    "consists of    * a collection of symbols ( like for instance  @xmath16 \" ,",
    " @xmath17 \" and  x \" ) which can be strung together into strings ( like  @xmath18 \" and  @xmath19 \" ) * a set of rules for determining which such strings are _ well - formed formulas _ , abbreviated wffs and pronounced  woofs \" by logicians * a set of rules for determining which wffs are _ theorems _      the formal system known as _",
    "boolean algebra _ can be defined using the symbols  @xmath16 \" ,  @xmath20 \" ,  @xmath21 \" , ",
    "@xmath22 $ ] \" and a number of letters  @xmath23 \" ,  @xmath24 \" , ...",
    "( these letters are referred to as _ variables _ ) .",
    "the set of rules for determining what is a wff are recursive :    * a single variable is a wff . * if the strings @xmath25 and @xmath4 are wffs , then the strings @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] are both wffs .",
    "finally , the rules for determining what is a theorem consist of two parts : a list of wffs which are stated to be theorems ( the wffs on this list are called _ axioms _ ) , and rules of inference for deriving further theorems from the axioms . the axioms are the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath28\\imp x]$ ] 2 .",
    "@xmath29 $ ] 3 .",
    "@xmath30\\imp[y\\eller x]]$ ] 4 .   @xmath31\\imp[[z\\eller x]\\imp [ z\\eller y]]]$ ]    the symbol  @xmath17 \" appearing here is not part of the formal system . the string ",
    "@xmath32 \" is merely a convenient abbreviation for",
    " @xmath33\\eller y$ ] \" .",
    "the rules of inference are    * the _ rule of substitution _ : if the string @xmath25 is a wff and the string @xmath4 is a theorem containing a variable , then the string obtained by replacing this variable by @xmath25 is a theorem . * _ modus ponens : _ if the string @xmath34 $ ] is a theorem and @xmath25 is a theorem , then @xmath4 is a theorem .",
    "two additional convenient abbreviations are @xmath35 ( defined as  @xmath36\\eller[\\icke y]]$ ] \" and @xmath37 ( defined as  @xmath38\\och[y\\imp x]$ ] \" ) .",
    "although customarily pronounced  not \" ,  or \" ,  and \" ,  implies \" and  is equivalent to \" , the symbols @xmath16 , @xmath20 , @xmath39 , @xmath17 and @xmath40 have no meaning whatever assigned to them  rather , any  meaning \" that we chose to associate with them is an emergent concept stemming from the axioms and rules of inference .    using nothing but these rules ,",
    "all theorems in boolean algebra textbooks can be derived , from simple strings such as ",
    "@xmath41 $ ] \" to arbitrarily long strings .",
    "the formal system of boolean algebra has a number of properties that gives it a special status among the infinitely many other formal systems .",
    "it is well - known that boolean algebra is _ complete _ , which means that given an arbitrary wff @xmath25 , either @xmath25 is provable or its negation , @xmath26 $ ] is provable .",
    "if any of the four axioms above were removed , the system would no longer be complete in this sense .",
    "this means that if an additional axiom @xmath25 is added , it must either be provable from the other axioms ( and hence unnecessary ) or inconsistent with the other axioms .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that ",
    "@xmath42\\imp y]$ ] \" is a theorem , , that if both a wff and its negation is provable , then _ every wff becomes provable_. thus adding an independent ( non - provable ) axiom to a complete set of axioms will reduce the entire formal system to a banality , equivalent to the trivial formal system defined by  all wffs are theorems \" .",
    "thus the formal system of boolean algebra is not as arbitrary as it may at first seem .",
    "in fact , it is so basic that almost all formal systems deemed complex enough by mathematicians to warrant their study are obtained by starting with boolean algebra and augmenting it with further symbols and axioms . for this reason",
    ", it appears at the bottom of the  tree \" of structures in .",
    "the above - mentioned example of boolean algebra illustrates several important points about formal systems in general .",
    "no matter how many ( consistent ) axioms are added to a complete formal system , the set of theorems remains the same .",
    "moreover , there are in general a large number of different choices of independent axioms that are equivalent in the sense that they lead to the same set of theorems , and a systematic attempt to reduce the theorems to as few independent axioms as possible would recover all of these choices independently of which one was used as a starting point .",
    "continuing our boolean algebra example , upgrading @xmath39 , @xmath17 and @xmath40 to fundamental symbols and adding additional axioms , one can again obtain a formal system where the set of theorems remains the same .",
    "conversely , as discovered by sheffer , an equivalent formal system can be obtained with even fewer symbols , by introducing a symbol  @xmath43 \" and demoting  @xmath44 \" and  @xmath45 \" to mere abbreviations for  @xmath46 \" and  @xmath47\\sheffer[y\\sheffer y]$ ] \" , respectively .",
    "also , the exact choice of notation is of course completely immaterial  a formal system with  % \" in place of  @xmath17 \" or with the bracket system eliminated by means of reverse polish notation would obviously be isomorphic and thus for mathematical purposes one and the same . in summary , although there are many different ways of describing the mathematical structure known as boolean algebra , they are in a well - defined sense all equivalent .",
    "the same can be said about all other mathematical structures that we will be discussing .",
    "all formal systems can thus be subdivided into a set of disjoint equivalence classes , such that the systems in each class all describe the same structure .",
    "when we speak of a mathematical structure , we will mean such an equivalence class , , _ that structure which is independent of our way of describing it_. it is to this structure that our 1a toe attributes physical existence .      if all mathematical structures have pe , then it is clearly desirable to have a crude overview of what mathematical structures there are .",
    "is by no means such a complete overview .",
    "rather , it contains a selection of structures ( solid rectangles ) , roughly based on the mathematics subject classification of the american mathematical society .",
    "they have been ordered so that following an arrow corresponds to adding additional symbols and/or axioms .",
    "we will now discuss some features of this  tree \" or  web \" that are relevant to the 1a toe , illustrated by examples .",
    "we will not describe the wff rules for the formal systems mentioned below , since the reader is certainly familiar with notation such as that for parentheses , variables and quantifiers , as well as with the various conventions for when parentheses and brackets can be omitted .",
    "for instance , within the formal system of number theory described below , a logician would read p(n ) as @xmath48 being the statement that the natural number @xmath49 is prime , , that for all natural numbers @xmath50 and @xmath51 exceeding unity , @xmath52 , and [ a>0 ] ( b)(c)[p(b)p(c ) ] as the ( still unproven ) goldbach hypothesis that all even numbers can be written as the sum of two primes .",
    "( again , we emphasize that despite that we conventionally read them this way , the symbols of a formal system have no meaning whatsoever  the properties that we humans coin words for merely emerge from the axioms and rules of inference . )",
    "moving upward in , the formal system known as _ lower predicate calculus _ is be obtained from boolean algebra by adding quantifiers ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "one way of doing this is to add the axioms    1 .",
    "@xmath55\\imp a(b)$ ] 2 .   @xmath56\\imp [ a\\eller [ ( \\forall a ) b(a)]]$ ]    and the rule that if @xmath57 is a theorem involving no quantifyers for @xmath50 , then @xmath58 $ ] is a theorem  @xmath59 $ ] can then be taken as a mere abbreviation for @xmath60 $ ] .    virtually all mathematical structures above lower predicate calculus in involve the notion of _ equality_. the relation @xmath61 ( sometimes written as @xmath62 instead ) obeys the so called axioms of equality :    1 .",

    "leads to other branches in .",
    "a slightly unusual position in the mathematical family tree is that labeled by  models \" in the figure .",
    "model theory ( see @xcite ) studies the relationship between formal systems and set - theoretical models of them in terms of sets of objects and relations that hold between these objects .",
    "for instance , the set of real numbers constitute a model for the field axioms . in the 1a toe ,",
    "all mathematical structures have pe , so set - theoretical models of a formal system enjoy the same pe that the formal system itself does .",
    "the variety of mathematical structures , a small part of which is illustrated in , is limited in two ways .",
    "first of all , they are much fewer than the formal systems , since they are equivalence classes as described in section  [ msdefsec ] . for instance , natural numbers ( under @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) are a single mathematical structure , even though there are numerous equivalent ways of axiomatizing the formal system of number theory .",
    "second , the self - consistency requirement adds a natural cutoff as one tries to proceed too far along arrows in . if one keeps adding axioms in the attempt to create a more complex structure , the bubble eventually bursts , as schematically illustrated in .",
    "for instance , consider the progression from semi - groups to groups to finite groups to the specific case of the dodecahedron group ( a dashed rectangle in ) , where each successive addition of axioms has made the structure less general and more specific .",
    "since the entire multiplication table of the dodecahedron group is specified , any attempt to make the dodecahedron still more  specific \" will make the formal system inconsistent , reducing it to the banal one where all wwf s are theorems .    also illustrates a more subtle occurrence of such a  complexity cutoff \" , where even adding new symbols does not prevent a branch of the tree from ending .",
    "since a field is in a sense a double group ( a group under the @xmath92 binary operation , and after removing its identity , also a group under the @xmath93 ) , it might seem natural to explore analogous triple groups , quadruple groups , in , these structures are labeled  double fields \" and  triple fields \" , respectively .",
    "a double field @xmath94 has 3 binary operations , say @xmath95 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , having identities that we will denote @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath79 , respectively , such that @xmath94 under @xmath95 and @xmath90 , and @xmath94 without @xmath96 under @xmath90 and @xmath91 are both fields .",
    "a triple field is defined analogously . for simplicity",
    ", we will limit ourselves to ones with a finite number of elements . whereas there is a rich and infinite variety of finite fields ( galois fields ) ,",
    "it can be shown @xcite that ( apart from a rather trivial one with 3 elements ) , there is only one double field per mersenne prime ( primes of the form @xmath98 ) , and it is not known whether there are infinitely many mersenne primes . as to finite triple fields",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that there are none at all , , that particular mathematical structure in is inconsistent and hence trivial .",
    "an analogous case of a  terminating branch \" is found by trying to extend the ladder of abelian fields beyond the sequence rational , real and complex numbers . by appropriately defining @xmath67 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 for quadruples ( rather than pairs ) of real numbers , one obtains the field of quaternions , also known as @xmath99 .",
    "however , the abelian property has been lost . repeating the same idea for larger sets of real numbers",
    "gives matrices , which do not even form a field ( since the sum of two invertible matrices can be non - invertible ) .",
    "suppose a sas were given the rules of some formal system and asked to compile a catalog of theorems ( for the present argument , it is immaterial whether the sas is a carbon - based life - form like ourselves , a sophisticated computer program or something completely different ) .",
    "one can then argue that @xcite it would eventually invent additional notation and branches of mathematics beyond this particular formal system , simply as a means of performing its task more efficiently . as a specific example , suppose that the formal system is boolean algebra as we defined it in section [ booleansec ] , and that the sas tries to make a list of all strings shorter than some prescribed length which are theorems ( the reader is encouraged to try this ) .",
    "after blindly applying the rules of inference for a while , it would begin to recognize certain patterns and realize that it could save considerable amounts of effort by introducing convenient notation reflecting these patterns .",
    "for instance , it would with virtual certainty introduce some notation corresponding to  @xmath36\\eller[\\icke y]]$ ] \" ( for which we used the abbreviation  @xmath17 \" ) at some point , as well as notation corresponding what we called  @xmath39 \" and  @xmath40 \" . if as a starting point we had given the sas the above - mentioned sheffer version of boolean algebra instead , it would surely have invented notation corresponding to  @xmath16 \" and @xmath20 as well .",
    "how much notation would it invent ?",
    "a borderline case would be something like writing @xmath100 as an  abbreviation \" for @xmath101 , since although the symbol @xmath102 is arguably helpful , its usefulness is so marginal that it is unclear whether it is worth introducing it at all  indeed , most logic textbooks do not .    after some time , the sas would probably discover that it s task could be entirely automated by inventing the concept of truth tables , where @xmath103\"$ ] and its negation play the roles of what we call  true \" and  false \" .",
    "furthermore , when it was investigating wffs containing long strings of negations , ,",
    " @xmath104 $ ] \" , it might find it handy to introduce the notion of counting and of even and odd numbers .    to further emphasize the same point ,",
    "if we gave the sas as a starting point the more complex formal system of number theory discussed above , it might eventually rediscover a large part of mathematics as we know it to aid it in proving theorems about the natural numbers .",
    "as is well known , certain theorems about integers are most easily proven by employing methods that use more advanced concepts such as real numbers , analytic functions , perhaps the most striking such example to date is the recent proof of fermat s last theorem , which employs state - of - the - art methods of algebraic geometry ( involving , , semistable elliptic curves ) despite the fact that the theorem itself can be phrased using merely integers .",
    "conversely , the systematic study of virtually any more complicated mathematical structure that did not explicitly involve say integers would lead a sas to reinvent the integers , since they are virtually ubiquitous .",
    "the same could be said about most other basic mathematical structures , , groups , algebras and vector spaces . just as it was said that _  all roads lead to rome \" _",
    ", we are thus arguing that _  all roads lead to the integers \" _ and other basic structures  which we therefore refer to as  emergent concepts \" .    if this point of view is accepted , then an immediate conclusion is that all types of sass would arrive at similar descriptions of the  mathematics tree \" .",
    "thus although one would obviously expect a certain bias towards being more interested in mathematics that appears relevant to physics , , to the particular structure in which the sas resides , it would appear unlikely that any form of sass would fail to discover basic structures such as say boolean algebra , integers and complex numbers .",
    "in other words , it would appear unlikely that we humans have overlooked any equally basic mathematical structures .",
    "above we saw that a general feature of formal systems is that all elements in a set are  born equal \"  further axioms are needed to discriminate between them .",
    "this means that symmetry and invariance properties tend to be more the rule than the exception in mathematical structures .",
    "for instance , a three - dimensional vector space automatically has what a physicist would call rotational symmetry , since no preferred direction appears in its definition .",
    "similarly , any theory of physics involving the notion of a manifold will automatically exhibit invariance under general coordinate transformations , simply because the very definition of a manifold implies that no coordinate systems are privileged over any other .    above",
    "we also saw that the smaller one wishes the ensemble to be , the more axioms are needed .",
    "defining a highly specific mathematical structure with built - in dimensionless numbers such as 1/137.0359895 is far from trivial .",
    "indeed , it is easy to prove that merely a denumerable subset of all real numbers ( a subset of measure zero ) can be specified by a finite number of axioms , , @xmath105 , the root of @xmath106 , ) has lebesgue measure zero .",
    "] so writing down a formal system describing a 1b toe with built - in  free parameters \" would be difficult unless these dimensionless numbers could all be specified  numerologically \" , as eddington once hoped .",
    "how does one use the category 1a toe to make physical predictions ? might it really be possible that a toe whose specification contains virtually no information can nonetheless make predictions such as that we will perceive ourselves as living in a space with three dimensions , ?",
    "heretic as it may sound , we will argue that yes , this might really be possible , and outline a program for how this could be done . roughly speaking ,",
    "this involves examining which mathematical structures might contain sass , and calculating what these would subjectively appear like to the sass that inhabit them . by requiring that this subjective appearance be consistent with all our observations ,",
    "we obtain a list of structures that are candidates for being the one we inhabit .",
    "the final result is a probability distribution for what we should expect to perceive when we make an experiment , using bayesian statistics to incorporate our lack of knowledge as to precisely which mathematical structure we reside in .",
    "a key issue is to understand the relationship between two different ways of perceiving a mathematical structure . on one hand",
    ", there is what we will call the _  view from outside \" _ , or the _  bird perspective \" _ , which is the way in which a mathematician views it . on the other hand",
    ", there is what we will call the _  view from inside \" _ , or the _  frog perspective \" _ , which is the way it appears to a sas in it .",
    "let us illustrate this distinction with a few examples :      here the distinction is so slight that it is easy to overlook it altogether .",
    "the outside view is that of a set of vector - valued functions of one variable , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , obeying a set of coupled nonlinear second order ordinary differential equations .",
    "the inside view is that of a number of objects ( say planets and stars ) at locations @xmath109 in a three - dimensional space , whose positions are changing with time .      here",
    "one choice of outside view is that of a set of real - valued functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 in @xmath112 which obey a certain system of lorentz - invariant linear partial differential equations ; the maxwell equations and the equation of motion @xmath113 .",
    "the correspondence between this and the inside view is much more subtle than in the above example , involving a number of notions that may seem counter - intuitive .",
    "arguably , the greatest difficulty in formulating this theory was not in finding the mathematical structure but in interpreting it .",
    "indeed , the correct equations had to a large extent already been written down by lorentz and others , but it took albert einstein to explain how to relate these mathematical objects to what we sass actually perceive , for instance by pointing out that the inside view in fact depended not only on the position of the sas but also on the velocity of the sas .",
    "a second bold idea was the notion that although the bird perspective is that of a four - dimensional world that just is , where nothing ever happens , it will appear from the frog perspective as a three - dimensional world that keeps changing .",
    "here history repeated itself : although the mathematics of the outside view had largely been developed by others ( , minkowski and riemann ) , it took the genius of einstein to relate this to the subjective experience from the frog perspective of a sas .",
    "as an illustration of the difficulty of relating the inside and outside views , consider the following scenario . on the eve of his death ,",
    "newton was approached by a genie who granted him one last wish .",
    "after some contemplation , he made up his mind : + _  please tell me what the state - of - the - art equations of gravity will be in 300 years . \" _",
    "+ the genie scribbled down the einstein field equations and the geodesic equation on a sheet of paper , and being a kind genie , it also gave the explicit expressions for the christoffel symbols and the einstein tensor in terms of the metric and explained to newton how to translate the index and comma notation into his own mathematical notation .",
    "would it be obvious to newton how to interpret this as a generalization of his own theory ?      here the difficulty of relating the two viewpoints reached a new record high , manifested in the fact that physicists still argue about how to interpret the theory today , 70 years after its inception .",
    "here one choice of outside view is that of a hilbert space where a wave function evolves deterministically , whereas the inside view is that of a world where things happen seemingly at random , with probability distributions that can be computed to great accuracy from the wave function .",
    "it took over 30 years from the birth of quantum mechanics until everett @xcite showed how the inside view could be related with this outside view .",
    "discovering decoherence , which was crucial for reconciling the presence of macrosuperpositions in the bird perspective with their absence in the frog perspective , came more than a decade later @xcite . indeed",
    ", some physicists still find this correspondence so subtle that they prefer the copenhagen interpretation with a category 2 toe where there is no outside view at all .",
    "based on the above progression of examples , one would naturally expect the correct theory of quantum gravity to pose even more difficult interpretational problems , since it must incorporate all of the above as special cases .",
    "a recent review @xcite poses the following pertinent question : _ is the central problem of quantum gravity one of physics , mathematics or philosophy ?",
    "_ suppose that on the eve of the next large quantum gravity meeting , our friend the genie broke into the lecture hall and scribbled the equations of the ultimate theory on the blackboard .",
    "would any of the participants realize what was being erased the next morning ?",
    "let us now introduce some notation corresponding to these two viewpoints .",
    "let @xmath114 denote what a certain sas subjectively perceives at a given instant . to be able to predict @xmath114",
    ", we need to specify three things :    * which mathematical structure this sas is part of * which of the many sass in this structure is this one * which instant ( according to the time perception of the sas ) we are considering .",
    "we will label the mathematical structures by @xmath115 , the sass in structure @xmath115 by @xmath116 and the subjective time of sas @xmath117 by @xmath118  this is a purely formal labeling , and our use of sums below in no way implies that these quantities are discrete or even denumerably infinite .",
    "we will refer to the set of all three quantities , @xmath119 , as a _",
    "location_. if the world is purely mathematical so that a toe in category 1 is correct , then specifying the location of a perception is in principle sufficient to calculate what the perception will be .",
    "although such a calculation is obviously not easy , as we will return to below , let us for the moment ignore this purely technical difficulty and investigate how predictions can be made .",
    "suppose that a sas at location @xmath120 has perceived @xmath121 up until that instant , and that this sas is interested in predicting the perception @xmath114 that it will have a subjective time interval @xmath122 into the future , at location @xmath123 .",
    "the sas clearly has no way of knowing _ a priori _ what the locations @xmath120 and @xmath123 are ( all it knows is @xmath121 , what it has perceived ) , so it must use statistics to reflect this uncertainty .",
    "a well - known law of probability theory tells us that for any mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive set of possibilities @xmath124 , the probability of an event @xmath125 is given by @xmath126 . using this twice",
    ", we find that the probability of @xmath114 given @xmath121 is p(x|y ) = _ l_0_l_1",
    "p(x|l_1)p(l_1|l_0 ) p(l_0|y ) . since",
    "a sas is by definition only in a single mathematical structure @xmath115 and since @xmath127 , the second factor will clearly be of the form p(l_1|l_0 ) & = & p(i_1,j_1,t_1|i_0,j_0,t_0 ) + & = & _ i_0 i_1(t_1-t_0-t ) p(j_1|i_0,j_0 ) .",
    "if , in addition , there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between the sass at @xmath128 and @xmath129 , then we would have simply @xmath130 .",
    "although this is the case in , for instance , classical general relativity , this is not the case in universally valid quantum mechanics , as schematically illustrated in .",
    "as to the third factor in , applying bayes theorem with a uniform prior for the locations gives @xmath131 , so reduces to & & p(x|y )   + & & _ i j_0 j_1 t p(x|i , j_1,t+t ) p(j_1|i , j_0 ) p(y|i , j_0,t ) , where @xmath132 should be normalized so as to be a probability distribution for @xmath114 .",
    "for the simple case when @xmath133 , we see that the resulting equation p(x|y ) _ ijt p(x|i , j , t+t)p(y|i , j , t ) has quite a simple interpretation .",
    "since knowledge of a location @xmath134 uniquely determines the corresponding perception , the two probabilities in this expression are either zero or unity .",
    "we have @xmath135 if a sas at location @xmath5 perceives @xmath114 and @xmath136 if it does not .",
    "@xmath132 is therefore simply a sum giving weight @xmath79 to all cases that are consistent with perceiving @xmath121 and then perceiving @xmath114 a time interval @xmath122 later , normalized so as to be a probability distribution over @xmath114 .",
    "the interpretation of the more general is analogous : the possibility of  observer branching \" simply forces us to take into account that we do not with certainty know the location @xmath123 where @xmath114 is perceived even if we know @xmath120 exactly .",
    "clarifies how the predictions from toe 1a differ from those in 1b : whereas the sum should be extended over all mathematical structures @xmath115 in the former case , it should be restricted to a certain subset ( that which is postulated to have pe ) in the latter case .",
    "in addition , 1b toes often include prescriptions for how to determine what we denote @xmath137 , , the correspondence between the inside and outside viewpoints , the correspondence between the numbers that we measure experimentally and the objects in the mathematical structure .",
    "such prescriptions are convenient simply because the calculation of @xmath137 is so difficult .",
    "nonetheless , it should be borne in mind that this is strictly speaking redundant information , since @xmath137 can in principle be computed _ a priori_.      in the past , the logical development has generally been to start with our frog perspective and search for a bird perspective ( a mathematical structure ) consistent with it . to explore the implications of our proposed toe using ,",
    "we face the reverse problem : given the latter , what can we say about the former ? given a mathematical structure containing a sas , what will this sas perceive , , what is @xmath137 ?",
    "this question is clearly relevant to all toes in category 1 , including 1b .",
    "indeed , few would dispute that a 1b toe would gain in elegance if any of its postulates in the above - mentioned  prescription \" category could be trimmed away with occam s razor by being shown to follow from the other postulates .",
    "perhaps the best guide in addressing this question is what we have ( arguably ) learned from previous successful theories .",
    "we discuss such lessons below .",
    "needless to say , the question of what a sas would perceive in a given mathematical structure is a very difficult one , which we are far from being able to answer at the present time .",
    "indeed , so far we have not even found a single mathematical structure that we feel confident might contain sass , since a self - consistent model of quantum gravity remains conspicuous with its absence .",
    "nonetheless , the successes of relativity theory and quantum mechanics have shown that we can make considerable progress even _ without _ having completely solved the problem , which would of course involve issues as difficult as understanding the human brain . in these theories",
    ", strong conclusions were drawn about what could and could not be perceived that were independent of any detailed assumption about the nature of the sas .",
    "we list a few examples below .      as sass",
    ", we can only perceive those aspects of the mathematical structure that are independent of our notation for describing it ( which is tautological , since this is all that has mathematical existence ) .",
    "for instance , as described in section  [ symmetrysec ] , if the mathematical structure involves a manifold , a sas can only perceive properties that have general covariance .",
    "we seem to perceive only those aspects of the mathematical structure ( and of ourselves ) that are useful to perceive , , which are relatively stable and predictable . within the framework of darwinian evolution",
    ", it would appear as though we humans have been endowed with self - awareness in the first place merely because certain aspects of our world are somewhat predictable , and since this self - awareness ( our perceiving and thinking ) increases our reproductive chances .",
    "self - awareness would then be merely a side - effect of advanced information processing .",
    "for instance , it is interesting to note that our bodily defense against microscopic enemies ( our highly complex immune system ) does not appear to be self - aware even though our defense against macroscopic enemies ( our brain controlling various muscles ) does .",
    "this is presumably because the aspects of our world that are relevant in the former case are so different ( smaller length scales , longer time scales , ) that sophisticated logical thinking and the accompanying self - awareness are not particularly useful here .",
    "below we illustrate this usefulness criterion with three examples .",
    "both relativity and quantum mechanics illustrate that we perceive ourselves as being  local \" even if we are not .",
    "although in the bird perspective of general relativity , we are one - dimensional world lines in a static four - dimensional manifold , we nonetheless perceive ourselves as points in a three - dimensional world where things happen .",
    "although a state where a person is in a superposition of two macroscopically different locations is perfectly legitimate in the bird perspective of quantum mechanics , both of these sass will perceive themselves as being in a well - defined location in their own frog perspectives .",
    "in other words , it is only in the frog perspective that we sass have a well - defined  local \" identity at all .",
    "likewise , we perceive objects other than ourselves as local .      we perceive ourselves as unique and isolated systems even if we are not .",
    "although in the bird perspective of universally valid quantum mechanics , we can end up in several macroscopically different configurations at once , intricately entangled with other systems , we perceive ourselves as remaining unique and isolated systems . what appears as ",
    "observer branching \" in the bird perspective , appears as merely a slight randomness in the frog perspective . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the correspondence between these two viewpoints can be elegantly modeled with the density matrix formalism , where the approximation that we remain isolated systems corresponds to partial tracing over all external degrees of freedom .",
    "we human beings replace the bulk of both our  hardware \" ( our cells , say ) and our  software \" ( our memories , ) many times in our life span .",
    "nonetheless , we perceive ourselves as stable and permanent @xcite .",
    "likewise , we perceive objects other than ourselves as permanent . or rather , what we perceive as objects are those aspects of the world which display a certain permanence . for instance ,",
    "as eddington remarked @xcite , when observing the ocean we perceive the moving waves as objects because they display a certain permanence , even though the water itself is only bobbing up and down .",
    "similarly , we only perceive those aspects of the world which are fairly stable to quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "quantum statistical mechanics illustrates that there can be ensembles within an ensemble .",
    "a pure state can correspond to a superposition of a person being in two different cities at once , which we , because of decoherence , count as two distinct sass , but a density matrix describing a mixed state reflects additional uncertainty as to which is the correct wave function .",
    "in general , a mathematical structure @xmath115 may contain two sass that perceive themselves as belonging to completely disjoint and unrelated worlds .",
    "as the above discussion illustrates , the correspondence between the inside and outside viewpoints has become more subtle in each new theory ( special relativity , general relativity , quantum mechanics ) .",
    "this means that we should expect it to be extremely subtle in a quantum gravity theory and try to break all our shackles of preconception as to what sort of mathematical structure we are looking for , or we might not even recognize the correct equations if we see them .",
    "for instance , criticizing the everett interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite on the grounds that it is  too crazy \" would reflect an impermissible bias towards the familiar classical concepts in terms of which we humans describe our frog perspective .",
    "in fact , the rival copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics does not correspond to a mathematical structure at all , and therefore falls into category 2 @xcite .",
    "rather , it attributes _",
    "a priori _ reality to the non - mathematical frog perspective (  the classical world \" ) and denies that there is a bird perspective at all .      until now",
    ", we have on purpose been quite vague as to what we mean by a sas , to reduce the risk of tacitly assuming that it must resemble us humans . however , some operational definition is of course necessary to be able to address the question in the title of this section .",
    "above we asked what a sas of a given mathematical structure would perceive . a sas definition allowing answers such as",
    " nothing at all \" or  complete chaos \" would clearly be too broad .",
    "rather , we picture a self - aware substructure as something capable of some form of logical thought .",
    "we take the property of being  self - aware \" as implicitly defined : a substructure is self - aware if it thinks that it is self - aware . to be able to perceive itself as thinking ( having a series of thoughts in some logical succession )",
    ", it appears as though a sas must subjectively perceive some form of time , either continuous ( as we do ) or discrete ( as our digital computers ) .",
    "that it have a subjective perception of some form of space , on the other hand , appears far less crucial , and we will not require this . nor",
    "will we insist on many of the common traits that are often listed in various definitions of life ( having a metabolism , ability to reproduce , ) , since they would tacitly imply a bias towards sass similar to ours living in a space with atoms , having a finite lifetime , as necessary conditions for containing a sas , we will require that a mathematical structure exhibit a certain minimum of merely three qualities :    * complexity * predictability * stability    what we operationally mean by these criteria is perhaps best clarified by the way in which we apply them to specific cases in section  [ islandsec ] . below",
    "we make merely a few clarifying comments .",
    "that self - awareness is likely to require the sas ( and hence the mathematical structure of which it is a part ) to possess a certain minimum _ complexity _ goes without saying . in this vein",
    ", barrow has suggested that only structures complex enough for gdel s incompleteness theorem to apply can contain what we call sass @xcite , but this is of course unlikely to be a sufficient condition .",
    "the other two criteria are only meaningful since we required sass to subjectively experience some form of time .    by _ predictability _ we mean that the sas should be able to use its thinking capacity to make certain inferences about its future perceptions . here",
    "we include for us humans rather obvious predictions , such as that an empty desk is likely to remain empty for the next second rather than , say , turn into an elephant .    by _ stability _",
    "we mean that a sas should exist long enough ( according to its own subjective time ) to be able to make the above - mentioned predictions , so this is strictly speaking just a weaker version of the predictability requirement .",

    " carbon - based life - forms \" instead of using the more general term the  sas \" . since our prior observations @xmath121 include the fact that we are carbon - based , , and since it is only prediction 1 ( mentioned in the introduction ) that is practically useful , would it not be preferable to eliminate the sas concept from the discussion altogether ?",
    "this is obviously a matter of taste .",
    "we have chosen to keep the discussion as general as possible for the following reasons :    * the requirement that mathematical structures should contain sass provides a clean way of severely restricting the number of structures to sum over in before getting into nitty - gritty details involving carbon , , which can instead be included as part of our observations @xmath121 . *",
    "we wish to minimize the risk of anthropocentric and  classical \" bias when trying to establish the correspondence between locations and perceptions .",

    "note that @xmath143 is not an additional parameter , since @xmath144 .",
    "in addition , the cosmological constant @xcite and the various neutrino masses will be important if they are non - zero , since they can contribute to the overall density of the universe and therefore affect both its expansion rate and its ability to form cosmological large - scale structure such as galaxies .",
    "how sensitive our existence is to the values of various high - energy physics parameters ( , the top quark mass ) is less clear , but we can certainly not at this stage rule out the possibility that their values are constrained by various early - universe phenomena .",
    "for instance , the symmetry breaking that lead to a slight excess of matter over anti - matter was certainly crucial for the current existence of stable objects .",
    "as was pointed out by max born , given that @xmath145 , the gross properties of all atomic and molecular systems are controlled by only two parameters : @xmath11 and @xmath146 .",

    "first of all , the fact that @xmath151 is crucial for chemistry as we know it . in a stable ordered structure ( , a chromosome ) , the typical fluctuation in the location of a nucleus relative to the inter - atomic spacing is @xmath152 , so for such a structure to remain stable over long time scales , one must have @xmath153 .",

    "grand unified theories rule out everything except the narrow strip between the two vertical lines , and carter s stellar argument predicts a point on the dashed line . in the narrow shaded region to the very left , electromagnetism is weaker than gravity and therefore irrelevant .",

    "insisting that the lower limit on the stellar mass ( which arises from requiring the central temperature to be high enough to ignite nuclear fusion ) not exceed the upper limit ( which comes from requiring that the star be stable ) @xcite , the dependence on @xmath139 cancels out and one obtains the constraint @xmath159 .",
    "a rock - bottom lower limit is clearly @xmath160 , since otherwise electrical repulsion would always be weaker than gravitational attraction , and the effects of electromagnetism would for all practical purposes be negligible .",
    "( more generally , if we let any parameter approach zero or infinity , the mathematical structure clearly loses complexity . )",
    "if one is willing to make more questionable assumptions , far tighter constraints can be placed .",
    "for instance , requiring a grand - unified theory to unify all forces at an energy no higher than the planck energy and requiring protons to be stable on stellar timescales gives @xmath161 , the two vertical lines in the figure . if it is true that a star must undergo a convective phase before arriving at the main sequence in order to develop a planetary system , then one obtains @xcite the severe requirement @xmath162 , which is plotted ( dashed curve ) using the observed value of @xmath139 .",
    "in addition to the above - mentioned constraints , a detailed study of biochemistry reveals that many seemingly vital processes hinge on a large number of ",
    "coincidences\"@xcite , ranging from the fact that water attains its maximum density above its freezing point to various chemical properties that enable high - fidelity dna reproduction . since all of chemistry is essentially determined by only two free parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath155 , it might thus appear as though there is a solution to an overdetermined problem with much more equations ( inequalities ) than unknowns .",
    "this could be taken as support for a religion - based category 2 toe , with the argument that it would be unlikely in all other toes .",

    "a similar constraint plot involving the strength of the strong interaction is shown in . whether an atomic nucleus is stable or not depends on whether the attractive force between its nucleons is able to overcome degeneracy pressure and coulomb repulsion .",

    "for instance , a re - derivation of relativistic mechanics for this more general case shows that energy now becomes an @xmath201-dimensional vector rather than a constant , whose direction determines in which of the many time - directions the world - line will continue , and in the non - relativistic limit , this direction is a constant of motion . in other words , if two non - relativistic observers that are moving in different time directions happen to meet at a point in spacetime , they will inevitably drift apart in separate time - directions again , unable to stay together .    another interesting difference , which can be shown by an elegant geometrical argument @xcite , is that particles become less stable when @xmath200 . for a particle to be able to decay when @xmath184 , it is not sufficient that there exists a set of particles with the same quantum numbers .",
    "it is also necessary , as is well - known , that the sum of their rest masses should be less than the rest mass of the original particle , regardless of how great its kinetic energy may be . when @xmath200 , this constraint vanishes @xcite .",

    "after all , we must avoid the fallacy of assuming that the design of our human bodies is the only one that allows self - awareness .",

    "] there is , however , an additional problem for sass when @xmath200 , which has not been previously emphasized even though the mathematical results on which it is based are well - known .",
    "it stems from the requirement of _ predictability _ which was discussed in section  [ predictionsec ] .",
    "if a sas is to be able to make any use of its self - awareness and information - processing abilities ( let alone function ) , the laws of physics must be such that it can make at least some predictions . specifically , within the framework of a field theory , it should by measuring various nearby field values be able to compute field values at some more distant space - time points ( ones lying along its future world - line being particularly useful ) with non - infinite error bars .",

    "we concluded that the requirements of complexity , predictability and stability are extremely restrictive in our  local neighborhood \" of mathematical structures , so it is not implausible that that islands of habitability are small and rare elsewhere in  mathematics space \" as well .",
    "for this reason , it is not obvious that there is more than a finite number of mathematical structures containing sass that are perceptibly different ( according to their sass ) , so that it might even be possible to catalogue all of them .",
    "many other obvious small departures from our island of habitability remain to be better explored in this framework , for instance changing the spacetime topology on sub - horizon scales , adding and removing low - mass particles , adding tachyonic particles , making more radical changes to the partial differential equations and discretizing or @xmath236-deforming spacetime .      in section",
    "[ predictionsec ] , we argued that the development of relativity theory and quantum mechanics has taught us that we must carefully distinguish between two different views of a mathematical structure :      understanding how to predict the latter from the former is one of the major challenges in working out the quantitative predictions of our proposed toe  and indeed in working out the quantitative predictions of _ any _ physical theory which is based on mathematics .",
    "perhaps the best guide in addressing this question is what we have ( arguably ) learned from previous successful theories :    * the correspondence between the two viewpoints has become more subtle in each new theory ( special relativity , general relativity , quantum mechanics ) , so we should expect it to be extremely subtle in a quantum gravity theory and try to break all our shackles of preconception as to what sort of mathematical structure we are looking for .",
    "otherwise we might not even recognize the correct equations if we see them .",
    "* we can only perceive those aspects of the mathematical structure that are independent of our notation for describing it .",
    "for instance , if the mathematical structure involves a manifold , a sas can only perceive properties that have general covariance . *",
    "we seem to perceive only those aspects of the structure ( and of ourselves ) which are useful to perceive , , which are relatively stable and predictable ( this is presumably because our design is related to darwinian evolution ) . *",
    "* example 1 : we perceive ourselves as  local \" even if we are not .",
    "although in the bird perspective of general relativity we are one - dimensional world lines in a static four - dimensional manifold , we perceive ourselves as points in a three - dimensional world where things happen . *",
    "* example 2 : we perceive ourselves as stable and permanent even if we are not .",
    "( we replace the bulk of both our hardware ( cells ) and software ( memories ) many times in our lifetime ) . *",
    "* example 3 : we perceive ourselves as unique and isolated systems even if we are not .",
    "although in the bird perspective of universally valid quantum mechanics we can end up in several macroscopically different configurations at once , intricately entangled with other systems , we perceive ourselves as remaining unique isolated systems merely experiencing a slight randomness .",
    "* there can be ensembles within the ensemble : even within a single mathematical structure ( such as quantum mechanics ) , different sass can perceive different and for all practical purposes independent physical realities .",
    "this question can clearly only be addressed by continued physics research along conventional lines , although we probably need to complement mathematical and experimental efforts with more work on understanding the correspondence between the inside and outside viewpoints .",
    "since some aspects of complex mathematical structures can often be approximated by simpler ones , we might never be able to determine precisely which one we are part of .",
    "however , if this should turn out to be the case , it clearly will not matter , since we can then obtain all possible physical predictions by just assuming that our structure is the simplest of the candidates .      all predictions of this theory",
    "take the form of probability distributions for the outcomes of future observations , as formally given by .",
    "this equation basically states that the probability distribution for observing @xmath114 a time @xmath122 after observing @xmath121 is a sum giving equal weight to all mathematical structures that are consistent with both @xmath114 and @xmath121 . as mentioned in the introduction , this is in fact quite similar to how predictions are made with 1b toes , the difference being simply that the sum is extended over _ all _ mathematical structures rather than just a single one or some small selection .",
    "it is convenient to discard all mathematical structures that do obviously not contain sass once and for all , as this greatly cuts down the number of structures to sum over .",
    "this is why it is useful to identify and weed out  dead worlds \" as was done in section  [ islandsec ] .",
    "after this first cut , all additional observations about the nature of our world of course provide additional cuts in the number of structures to sum over .          using popper s falsifiability requirement",
    ", one might argue that _  this toe does not qualify as a scientific theory , since it can not be experimentally ruled out \" .",
    "_ in fact , a moment of consideration reveals that this argument is false .",
    "the toe we have proposed makes a large number of statistical predictions , and therefore _ can _ eventually be ruled out at high confidence levels if it is incorrect , using prediction 1 from the introduction as embodied in .",
    "prediction 2 from the introduction offers additional ways of ruling it out that other theories lack .",
    "such rejections based on a single observation are analogous to those involving statistical predictions of quantum mechanics : suppose that we prepare a silver atom with its spin in the @xmath238-direction and then measure its spin in a direction making an angle of @xmath239 with the @xmath238-axis . since the theory predicts the outcome to be",
    " spin up \" with a probability @xmath240 , a single observation of  spin down \" would imply that quantum mechanics had been ruled out at a confidence level exceeding 99.9% .",
    "indeed , the author once thought that this toe was ruled out by the observation that space is three - dimensional , since if all higher dimensionalities were at least as habitable for sass as our own , the a priori probability of our living in a space so near the bottom of the list would be virtually zero .",
    "the theory is saved merely because of ehrenfest s observation that @xmath179 precludes atoms , which the author was unaware of at the time ( and independently rediscovered , just as many others have ) .",
    "] instead , the falsifiability argument can be applied against rival toes in category 1b , as discussed in section  [ nonexistencesec ] below .",
    "one might argue that _",
    " this toe is useless in practice , since it can not make any interesting predictions \" .",
    "_ this argument is also incorrect .",
    "first of all , if only one mathematical structure should turn out to be consistent with all our observations , then we will with 100% certainty know that this is the one we inhabit , and the 1a toe will give identical predictions to the 1b toe that grants only this particular structure pe .",
    "secondly , probabilistic calculations as to which structure we inhabit can also provide quantitative predictions .",
    "it was such bayesean reasoning that enabled hoyle to predict the famous 7.7 mev resonance in the @xmath171 nucleus @xcite , and we would expect the derived probability distributions to be quite narrow in other cases as well when parameters appear in exponentials . although many in principle interesting calculations ( such as the high - resolution version of suggested above ) are numerically very difficult at the present stage , there are also areas where this type of calculations do not appear to be unfeasibly difficult .",
    "the parameters characterizing cosmological initial conditions provide one such example where work has already been done @xcite . shedding more light on the question of whether or not particle physicists should expect a",
    " mass desert \" up to near the planck scale might also be possible by a systematic study of the extent to which  generic \" models are consistent with our low - energy observations @xcite .",
    "when it comes to discrete parameters , our toe in fact makes some strikingly specific _ a priori _ predictions given the other laws of physics , such as that our spacetime should be 3 + 1-dimensional ( see ) .",
    "thus an extremely prodigal new - born baby could in principle , before opening its eyes for the first time , paraphrase descartes by saying",
    " _ cogito , ergo space is three - dimensional _ \" .",
    "one might argue that this toe is vulnerable to occam s razor , since it postulates the existence of other worlds that we can never observe .",
    "_ why should nature be so wasteful and indulge in such opulence as to contain an infinite plethora of different worlds ?",
    "_    intriguingly , this argument can be turned around to argue _ for _ our toe .",
    "when we feel that nature is wasteful according to this theory , what precisely are we disturbed about her wasting ?",
    "certainly not  space \" , since we are perfectly willing to accept a single friedmann - robertson - walker universe with an infinite volume , most of which we can never observe  we accept that this unobservable space has pe since it allows a simpler theory . certainly not",
    " mass \" or  atoms \" , for the same reason  once you have wasted an infinite amount of something , who cares if you waste some more ?",
    "rather , it is probably the apparent reduction in simplicity that appears disturbing , the quantity of information necessary to specify all these unseen worlds .",
    "however , as is discussed in more detail in @xcite , _ an entire ensemble is often much simpler than one of its members _ , which can be stated more formally using the notion of _ algorithmic information content _",
    "@xcite , also referred to as _",
    "algorithmic complexity_. for instance , the algorithmic information in a number is roughly speaking defined as the length ( in bits ) of the shortest computer program which will produce that number as output , so the information content in a generic integer @xmath49 is of order @xmath241 .",
    "nonetheless , the set of all integers @xmath242 can be generated by quite a trivial computer program @xcite , so the algorithmic complexity of the whole set is smaller than that of a generic member .",
    "similarly , the set of all perfect fluid solutions to the einstein field equations has a smaller algorithmic complexity than a generic particular solution , since the former is specified simply by giving a few equations and the latter requires the specification of vast amounts of initial data on some hypersurface . loosely speaking ,",
    "the apparent information content rises when we restrict our attention to one particular element in an ensemble , thus losing the symmetry and simplicity that was inherent in the totality of all elements taken together . in this sense , our  ultimate ensemble \" of all mathematical structures has virtually no algorithmic complexity at all .",
    "since it is merely in the frog perspective , in the subjective perceptions of sass , that this opulence of information and complexity is really there , one can argue that an ensemble theory is in fact more economical than one endowing only a single ensemble element with pe @xcite .          in a his famous essay  the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences \" @xcite",
    ", wigner argues that  the enormous usefulness of mathematics in the natural sciences is something bordering on the mysterious \" , and that  there is no rational explanation for it \" .",
    "this can be used as an argument against toes in category 2 . for 1a and 1b toes , on the other hand , the usefulness of mathematics for describing the physical world is a natural consequence of the fact that the latter _ is _ a mathematical structure .",
    "the various approximations that constitute our current physics theories are successful because simple mathematical structures can provide good approximations of how a sas will perceive more complex mathematical structures . in other words , our successful theories are not mathematics approximating physics , but mathematics approximating mathematics !    in our category 1a toe , wigner s question about why there are laws of physics that we are able to discover follows from the above - mentioned predictability requirement . in short , we can paraphrasing descartes : _  cogito , ergo lex . \" _",
    "a second challenge for defenders of a category 2 toe is that mathematics is far more than the study of numbers that is taught in school .",
    "the currently popular formalist definition of mathematics as the study of formal systems @xcite ( which is reflected in our discussion of mathematical structures in section  [ mesec ] ) is so broad that for all practical purposes , _ any _ toe that is definable in purely formal terms ( independent of vague human terminology ) will fall into category 1 rather than 2 .",
    "for instance , a toe involving a set of different types of entities ( denoted by words , say ) and relations between them ( denoted by additional words ) is nothing but what mathematicians call a set - theoretical model , and one can generally find a formal system that it is a model of . since proponents of a category 2 toe must argue that some aspects of it are _ not _ mathematical",
    ", they must thus maintain that the world is in some sense not describable at all .",
    "physicists would thus be wasting their time looking for such a toe , and one can even argue about whether such a toe deserves to be called a theory in the first place .",
    "if the archipelago of habitability covers merely an extremely small fraction of our local neighborhood of  mathematics space \" , then a category 1b toe would provide no explanation for the  miracle \" that the parameter values of the existing world happen to lie in the range allowing sass .",
    "for instance , if nuclear physics calculations were to show that stellar heavy element production requires @xmath243 and a 1b toe would produce a purely numerological calculation based on gravity quantization giving @xmath244 , then this  coincidence \" would probably leave many physicists feeling disturbed . why should the existence of life arise from a remarkable feat of fine - tuning on the part of nature ? however , in all fairness , we must bear in mind that extreme smallness of the archipelago ( and indeed even extreme smallness of our own island ) has not been convincingly demonstrated , as stressed by .",
    "even the dimensionality observation mentioned in footnote [ 3dfootnote ] hardly qualifies as such a fine - tuning argument , since a small integer appearing from a calculation would appear far less arbitrary than an enormous integer or a number like 137.0359895 .",
    "rather , we mention this fine tuning issue simply to encourage actual calculations of how small the islands are .",
    "the claim that some mathematical structure ( different from ours ) does _ not _ have physical existence is an empirically completely useless statement , since it does not lead to any testable predictions , not even probabilistic ones .",
    "nonetheless , it is precisely such claims that all toes in category 1b must make to distinguish themselves from the 1a toe .",
    "this makes them vulnerable to popper s criticism of not qualifying as physical theories , since this aspect of them is not falsifiable . as an example , let us suppose that a detailed calculation shows that only five tiny islands in allow heavy element production in stars , with a total area less than @xmath245 of the total in the plot . in a 1b toe predicting the observed values , this would _ not _ allow us to say that the theory had been ruled out with @xmath246 significance , nor at any significance level at all , simply because , contrary to the 1a toe , there is no ensemble from which probabilities emerge .",
    "however uncomfortable we might feel about the seeming  miracle \" that the theory happened to predict parameter values allowing life , a defender of the theory could confidently ignore our unease , knowing that the claimed nonexistence of worlds with other parameter values could never be falsified .",
    "moreover , purely philosophical arguments about whether certain mathematical structures have pe or not ( which is the sole difference between 1a and 1b toes ) appear about as pointless as the medieval purely philosophical arguments about whether there is a god or not , when we consider that the entire notion of pe is painfully poorly defined . would most physicists attribute pe to galaxies outside of our horizon volume ?",
    "to unobservable branches of the wavefunction ?",
    "if a mathematical structure contains a sas , then the claim that it has pe operationally means that this sas will perceive itself as existing in a physically real world , just as we do . for the many other mathematical structures that correspond to dead worlds with no sass there to behold them , for instance the 4 + 1-dimensional ( atom - free ) analog of our world , who cares whether they have pe or not ? in fact , as discussed in @xcite and above in section  [ economysec ] , the totality of all worlds is much less complex than such a specific world , and it is only in the subjective frog perspective of sass that seemingly complex structures such as trees and stellar constellations exist at all .",
    "thus in this sense , not even the pines and the big dipper of our world would exist if neither we nor any other sass were here to perceive them .",
    "the answer to hawking s question `` what is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe ? '' @xcite would then be `` you , the sas '' .    further attacking the distinction between physical and mathematical existence",
    ", one can speculate that future physicists will find the 1a toe to be true _",
    "tautologically_[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "this would be a natural extension of a famous analogy by eddington @xcite :    * one might say that wherever there is light , there are associated ripples in the electromagnetic field .",
    "but the modern view is that light _ is _ the ripples .",
    "* one might say that wherever there is matter , there are associated ripples in the metric known as curvature .",
    "but eddington s view is that matter _ is _ the ripples .",
    "* one might say that wherever there is pe , there is an associated mathematical structure .",
    "but according to our toe , physical existence _ is _ the mathematical structure .",
    "if the toe we have proposed is correct , then what are the implications ?",
    "as mentioned , answering the question of which mathematical structure we inhabit requires  business as usual \" in terms of continuing theoretical and experimental research .",
    "however , there are also a number of implications for how we should focus our physics research , as summarized below .      in coffee rooms throughout the world",
    ", derogatory remarks are often heard to the effect that certain physics theories ( string theory , quantum groups , certain approaches to quantum gravity , occasionally also grand unified and supersymmetric theories ) , are mere mathematical diversions , having nothing to do with physical reality . according to our toe , _ all _ such mathematical structures have physical existence if they are self - consistent , and therefore merit our study unless it can be convincingly demonstrated that their properties preclude the existence of sass .",
    "one obvious first step toward more quantitative predictions from this toe is to explore the parameter space of the various continuous and discrete physical parameters in more detail , to map out the archipelago of potential habitable islands .",
    "for instance , by using a crude model for how the relevant nuclear spectra depend on @xmath11 and @xmath13 , one should attempt to map out the various islands allowing an unbroken reaction chain for heavy element production in stars , thereby refining .",
    "if the islands should turn out to cover only a tiny fraction of the parameter space , it would become increasingly difficult to believe in category 1b toes . as mentioned",
    ", this type of calculation also offers a way to test and perhaps rule out the toe that we are proposing .",
    "since all mathematical structures are _ a priori _ given equal statistical weight , it is important to study the purely formal nature of the mathematical models that we propose .",
    "would adding , changing or removing a few axioms produce an observationally equally viable model ?",
    "for instance , if there is a large class of much more generic mathematical structures that would give identical predictions for low - energy physics but that would deviate at higher energies , then we would statistically expect to find such a deviation when our colliders become able to probe these energy scales .",
    "( here we of course mean _ mathematical _ axioms , as in section  [ mesec ] , not informal  axioms \" regarding the correspondence between the mathematics and our observations , such as  axiom 3 of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics \" . )",
    "a popularly held belief is that the dimensionless parameters of nature will turn out to be computable from first principles .",
    "for instance , eddington spent years of his life developing theories where @xmath11 was exactly @xmath247 and exactly @xmath248 , respectively .",
    "if the above - mentioned analysis of heavy element production in stars were to reveal that the archipelago of habitability covered only a tiny fraction of the parameter space in , then within the framework of our toe , we would conclude that it is highly unlikely that @xmath11 is given by  numerology \" , and concentrate our research efforts elsewhere .",
    "since all mathematical structures have pe in this theory , it of course allows no sympathy whatsoever for subjective nostalgic bias towards structures that resemble cozy classical concepts .",
    "for instance , criticism of the everett interpretation of quantum mechanics for being  too crazy \" falls into this forbidden category .",
    "similarly , a model clearly can not be criticized for involving  unnecessarily large \" ensembles .      considering how difficult it is to predict how a mathematical structure will be perceived by a sas , a systematic study of this issue probably merits more attention than it is currently receiving . in the current era of specialization , where it is easy to get engrossed in mathematical technicalities , substantial efforts in phenomenology",
    "are needed to make the connection with observation , going well beyond simply computing cross sections and decay rates .",
    "even if we are eventually able to figure out which mathematical structure we inhabit , which in the terminology of weinberg @xcite corresponds to discovering  the final theory \" ( note that our usage of  the word ",
    "theory \" is slightly different ) , our task as physicists is far from over . in weinberg s",
    "own words @xcite : _  wonderful phenomena , from turbulence to thought , will still need exploration whatever final theory is discovered . the discovery of a final theory will not necessarily even help very much in making progress in understanding these phenomena [ ... ] . a final theory will be final in only one sense  it will bring to an end a certain sort of science , the ancient search for those principles that can not be explained in terms of deeper principles . \" _    if the toe proposed in this paper is indeed correct , then the search for the ultimate principles has ended in a slight anti - climax : finding the toe was easy , but working out its experimental implications is probably difficult enough to keep physicists and mathematicians occupied for generations to come .",
