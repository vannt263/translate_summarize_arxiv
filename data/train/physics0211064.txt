    "this research attempts at developing an information preserving image coding suitable for handling medical images which usually do not allow any degree of image degradation in comparison with the source images @xcite .",
    "jpeg , one of the well accepted compression standards , exhibits an excellent compression gain , but does not insure that the decoded result is the exact replica of the original . a variation of dpcm or pixel difference coding , namely \" guided scan pixel difference coding was studied .",
    "a major modification to the classical dpcm is the inclusion of scan information , in terms of the direction used to calculate the pixel difference and step size .",
    "this additional information does not significantly increase the volume of coded data .",
    "it actually opens the extensibility for the dpcm to be able to handle multi - dimensional image data , in a similar manner as jpeg is extended to mpeg to handle movie presentation .",
    "another important asp ect of medical image coding , which is the ability to access the full details of a local image ( often referred to as roi , region of interest ) , is also satisfied .",
    "neither the location of a roi nor the scanning method is restricted so that a local area of roi can be selected anywhere in the original image .",
    "the flexibility in scanning makes it possible to use the same code for real time movie presentation in the same way mpeg uses jpeg .",
    "this research considers two stage redundancy removal , one by taking pixel differences and the other by an entropic source coding similar to the huffman coding to achieve a redundancy removal of approximately 4 - 5 bpp ( bits per pixel ) .",
    "+ the sizes of medical images have increased with the advancement in various medical imaging modalities , typically in mri and x - ray cat scan .",
    "mri can scan a whole body within a reasonable time of 30 minutes and x - ray cat has adopted helical scanning for a higher spatial resolution . in the case of 3d scanning , the image size could be as large as 100 million pixels .",
    "images of this size are usually stored on writable laser disks ( cd - worm ) , but this imposes serious problems when the retrieval of such data is attempted through a communication channel in the wide area network ( wan ) environment using 64 kbits / sec bit - rate telephone channels .",
    "+ the problems associated with the compression of medical images are two fold .",
    "the first requirement is that compression must be absolutely non - degradable .",
    "regardless of whether a picture has been affected by measurement noise that occurs in the process of physical measurement and in image reconstruction , the source data acquired at an imager must be retained without any kind of losses .",
    "the second condition is the integrity of the objects contained in a picture data .",
    "physicians examine very closely the image in a roi ( region of interest ) or a number of roi s .",
    "a selected roi needs to be immediately accessible and it must be translated into a serial stream of compressed data for transmission via a communication channel .",
    "the scalar quantization problem entails the specification of a set of decision levels @xmath0 and a set of reconstruction levels @xmath1 in a way such that some quantization error measure is minimized .",
    "the lloyd - max algorithm is based on the minimization of the mean - square error defined as :    @xmath2=\\int_{a}^{b } dx \\hspace{1 mm } p(x ) ( x-\\hat{x})^2   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.5 cm } = \\sum_{j=0}^{j-1 } { \\int_{d_{j}}^{d_{j+1 } } { dx \\hspace{1mm}p(x)(x - r_{j})^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath3 is defined over the interval @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "@xmath5 is the expectation value with respect to the pdf @xmath3 and @xmath6 is the mean value with respect to @xmath3 . the total number of levels @xmath7 depends on the number @xmath8 of available bits to encode them",
    ". considering @xmath9 a function of all the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 levels , the minimum of the mean - square error is obtained by taking the derivatives of @xmath10 with respect to the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 .",
    "this yields the coupled sets of equations @xmath11 :    @xmath12    simplifying , these equations are rewritten as :    @xmath13    these sets of equations form the lloyd - max algorithm .",
    "starting from some initial value @xmath14 the lloyd - max set of equations will allow us to calculate all the decision and reconstruction levels .",
    "in fact , it appears that the error @xmath15 is a function of @xmath14 only when we are dealing with the mean - square error quantization .",
    "the pseudo - code algorithm is therefore : @xmath16 get } d_{j } ; \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{2 cm }          \\mbox { from [ 4 ] get } r_{j } ; \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{1 cm }                  j = j+1 ; \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{0.5 cm }    if \\hspace{1 mm } ( j \\le j ) \\mbox { go to } ( * ) ; \\nonumber \\\\ & & end\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above algorithm has two main ingredients :    * a minimization procedure to find the optimal value of the starting reconstruction level @xmath14 . * a root - solving procedure allowing the determination of @xmath17 from @xmath1 and @xmath0 with an implicit function [ 5 ] of @xmath17 which is the ratio of two integrals .",
    "several difficulties might arise :    1 .",
    "the function @xmath18 is highly singular with many local minima separarted by large values of the function as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "this means that one has to have a good guess for the starting value @xmath14 otherwise one will converge to the local minmium and not the global one .",
    "the integrals appearing in [ 2 ] should be calculated with a very high accuracy despite the fact we are dealing with very rapidly exponential functions in the integrand ( this is the case of the laplace , gamma , rayleigh , gaussian and stretched exponential pdf s .",
    "the uniform distribution does not have these problems but many other pdf s contain an exponential term ) .",
    "we have implemented an algorithm based on an analytical approach that will deal with an integrand containing arbitrary powers of x and an exponential function of an arbitrary power of x. the minimization procedure is handled graphically within the software by plotting the function @xmath18 over a large interval , allowing the approximate location of the starting point that will drive the search towards the global minimum region .",
    "+ several examples will be treated below and look - up tables are given for the levels for a quantization based on an arbitrary number of bits .",
    "some of these tables are compared to highly accurate published tables and new tables are given for the stretched exponential pdf needed in mutiresolution image processing .",

    "from a histogram of an image pixel intensities , we evaluate the absolute mean @xmath38 and standard deviation @xmath39 and extract from them the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath40 of the stretched exponential probability density function given by eq.12 . + following [ 1 ] ,",
    "we perform firstly the extraction of the parameter @xmath40 from the equation :    @xmath41    where , the function @xmath42 is defined by :    @xmath43    and @xmath37 is defined by :    @xmath44    @xmath45 is equal to the ordinary mean , since the histogram function of a picture is defined for positive values of the intensity levels .",
    "the entropy ( in bits / pixel ) is given by the formula :    @xmath46    in fig.4 we display the variation of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath37 in the interval [ 0.1 - 5 ] for a given @xmath40 picked in the interval [ 0.8 - 1.5 ] .",

    "once the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath40 have been determined for a particular image along with its corresponding entropy , we proceed to the quantization procedure .",
    "we have implemented the simple lloyd - max algorithm [ 2,3 ] that minimizes the quantization error for the stretched exponential pdf .",
    "figures 2 and 3 illustrate the reconstruction levels versus the decision levels in the case the number of bits is 6 and the values @xmath48 and @xmath49 . the quantized levels are compared to the gaussian and laplace cases for the same number of bits . in the stretched exponential case , an arbitrary value of @xmath37 is valid in order to have @xmath20 and @xmath50 .",
