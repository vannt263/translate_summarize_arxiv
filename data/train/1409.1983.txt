    "studies of localization of the de broglie waves in disordered and quasi - disordered environments have received renewed attention in the recent years primarily due to the direct observation of anderson localization@xcite of these matter waves in cold atom experiments@xcite .",
    "while random disorder localizes all states in one dimension@xcite , a deterministic disorder distribution like the one in the aubry - ande model(aa)@xcite leaves all states extended if the disorder strength remains below a critical value .",
    "the aa model@xcite ( or the harper model@xcite ) has already been experimentally realized and a detailed study of its localization properties conducted@xcite . in the aa model ,",
    "since all the states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength , there is no mobility edge .",
    "recent theoretical studies@xcite have discovered the development of mobility edges in several extended aa models .",
    "continuing along this direction of research , in this paper we consider the effects of a superlattice potential on the single particle and collective properties of non - interacting bosons in a one dimensional aa model . among other results ,",
    "we find a re - entrant single particle localization - delocalization transition with increasing superlattice potential strength .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the studies of the single particle localization properties are presented in sec .",
    "ii . the sec .",
    "iii deals with the effects of the superlattice potential on the the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in this section , we consider the effect of a superlattice potential on the single particle localization properties .",
    "consider a lattice boson moving in a one - dimensional lattice with aa disorder and an additional superlattice potential .",
    "for this system , the hamiltonian is : @xmath0c^{\\dag}_{i}c_{i},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the the energy gain when a boson hops from site @xmath3 to its nearest neighbor ( nn ) site @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a creation operator of a boson at site @xmath3 , @xmath6 the strength of the aa potential , @xmath7 = ( @xmath8 + 1)/2 is the incommensurability parameter , and @xmath9 is the strength of the superlattice potential . here",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath6 , and @xmath9 have energy units .",
    "all the energies in this paper are measured in units of @xmath1 and all the lengths are measured in units of the lattice parameter . when @xmath9 = 0 , one obtains the aa model and energy independent localization of all the states for @xmath10 , and thus there is no mobility edge . to study the effects of finite @xmath9 on the localization properties ,",
    "we first write @xmath11 in the single particle site basis and then numerically diagonalize it to obtain its eigen - energies and eigen - functions .",
    "all our results presented in this paper are for a lattice of 610 sites .",
    "we monitor the localization of a given eigen - state with amplitude @xmath12 at site @xmath3 @xmath13 by calculating its inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) defined by @xmath14 where , @xmath15     ( solid line ) with v of the eigen - energy levels 208 ( top panel ) and 242 ( bottom panel ) for @xmath6 = 1.5 .",
    "the variations of the density of states ( dos)(@xmath16 and @xmath17 ) for these eigen - energy levels are also shown ( dash - dot).,width=480 ]    in fig .",
    "1 we have displayed the ipr values of all the 610 states for various values ( @xmath18 2 ) of @xmath6 . for these values of @xmath6 ,",
    "all the states are extended in the absence of @xmath9 .",
    "we find that increasing @xmath9 drives most states to localized .",
    "we also notice that the band edge states are more susceptible to localization and become localized for smaller values of @xmath9 .",
    "when we increase @xmath6 another qualitatively different behavior is found . in the results shown for @xmath6 = 1.3 and 1.5",
    ", we notice that some states exhibit a re - entrant localization - delocalization transition .",
    "we do not find any re - entrant behavior with increasing @xmath6 for a fixed @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "a consequence of the localization - delocalization transition is the enhancement of the entanglement with increasing @xmath9 for the concerned states in relevant regions , as shown in fig .",
    "the entanglement is measured by the shannon entropy@xcite defined by @xmath19 the variation of the single particle spectrum with @xmath9 for @xmath6 = 1.5 is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear that for several values of @xmath9 the system develops _ multiple _ mobility edges .",
    "this may be contrasted with the development of a single mobility edge due next nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping in the absence of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "the development of mobility edges due to @xmath9 can also be seen in fig . 5 , where we have plotted the single particle spectrum and the corresponding ipr values as a function of @xmath6 for @xmath20 .",
    "one also notices that beyond @xmath21 , all the states are localized .",
    "further , while @xmath6 shifts more levels in to the central gap region , the @xmath9 has the opposite effect .",
    "note also the development of multiple mobility edges in some range of values of @xmath6 .",
    "we also find that the delocalization to localization transition or vice versa for any energy eigen - state is associated with a rise in the single particle density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the variations of the dos with @xmath9 for two eigen - energies are also shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that whenever @xmath22 drops or rises rapidly signaling a delocalization - localization transition or vice versa the dos shows a peak . at this juncture",
    "we are unable to provide an analytical explanation of these results .",
    "clearly , the superlattice potential destroys the self - duality of the aa model , and a complex interplay of the aa quasi - disorder and the superlattice potential lead to new qualitative features like the re - entrant localization - delocalization transition and the development of multiple mobility edges .",
    "considering cold atom experiments in mind , we have checked the effect of an overall harmonic confining potential . in this case",
    "the system hamiltonian becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 , which has an energy unit , is the harmonic confining potential strength .",
    "for the harmonic trap , we use open boundary conditions which is more appropriate .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in fig .",
    "the confining potential clearly drives more states localized .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively expected as a confining potential generally favors localization .",

    "in the previous section we have shown the superlattice potential leads to significant changes in the nature of the eigen - states of the aa model .",
    "these changes may influence the collective properties like bose - einstein condensation of a many - boson system ( see also the note in ref . ) . in this section ,",
    "we study the effect of @xmath9 on the ground state occupancy of a many - boson system in aa potential with an overall harmonic confining potential .",

    "the temperature variation of the fractional ground state population(@xmath34 ) , where @xmath35 is the ground state population and @xmath36 the total number of bosons , for various values of @xmath9 and @xmath6 = 1.5 is shown in fig . 7 . while in the low temperature range ( @xmath37 0.1 ) , the @xmath34 decreases with @xmath9 , it increases with @xmath9 in the higher temperature range .",
    "the behavior of @xmath34 is determined by the low energy levels .",

    "the ground state and the first excited state become almost degenerate and the bosons are distributed equally in these levels leading to a drop of @xmath34 from 1 to about 0.5 as seen in fig",
    "we also see that the second excited state onwards , the excited state energies move away from the ground state with increasing @xmath9 .",
    "so , in the higher temperature range , the population of these excited states decrease with increasing @xmath9 leading to an increase in @xmath34 .",
    "in this paper , we first investigated the effect of a superlattice potential on the single particle localization properties of a lattice boson in the presence of aa disorder .",
    "we find a re - entrant localization - delocalization transition and the development of multiple mobility edges for range of superlattice potential strengths .",
    "we also studied the bose - einstein condensation with an additional harmonic trapping potential .",
    "it is found that while an increase in the superlattice potential leads to an increase in the depletion of the condensate in the low temperature limit , it has the opposite effect beyond this temperature regime .",
    "these trends of the condensate fraction was argued to be resulting from the changes in the low energy single particle spectrum produced by the superlattice and the quasi - disorder potentials .",
