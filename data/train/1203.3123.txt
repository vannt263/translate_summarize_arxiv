    "according to the anderson s theorem @xcite , the cooper pairs with singlet pairing can survive in the presence of non - magnetic impurities , while the magnetic impurities are detrimental to superconductivity yielding a unique pattern of the electronic local density of states ( ldos ) .",

    "theoretically it was argued that this type of pairing should also be fragile to the non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "one of the puzzles concerning this model is why superconductivity survives up to a relatively high temperature in some doped samples , such as the ba(fe@xmath0t@xmath1)@xmath4as@xmath4 ( t = co , ni , ru , etc . ) , where the dopants are supposed to be the pair breakers .",

    "the details are explained elsewhere.@xcite note that , in the rpa calculation around @xmath41 , the absolute values of the gap functions are not determined , and only their relative sizes are obtained .",
    "therefore , we adjust the largest gap value to be consistent with the experiment . on the other hand , for the s++ case , the gap functions are obtained from the analysis of the five - orbital attractive hubbard model .",

    "the actual calculation of ldos is performed using chebyshev polynomial expansion method @xcite with @xmath56 lattice sites and 3600 polynomials .",
    "the lorentzian - type broadening kernel is used and the broadening factor is determined so as to make @xmath57 consistent with experiment .",
    "because of this broadening , ldos at @xmath58 remains finite even in the s++ case , which comes mainly from the tail of the peak at the gap edge .",
    "the electron number is fixed at @xmath59 by adjusting the chemical potential .",
    "there are two important factors that should be included when we compare the theoretical calculations with experimental data .",
    "first , there is a band renormalization effect due to electron - electron correlation which is neglected in the first - principle calculations . in iron pnictides ,",
    "the effective mass obtained in arpes is larger than that obtained in the first - principle calculation by a factor of about 2.5 .",
    "therefore , in order to take account of the band renormalization factor ( not included in the first - principle calculations ) , the hopping integrals and site - potentials in the model hamiltonian should be reduced by a factor 2.5 . by considering this effect , we reduce the energy scale of the obtained results by factor 2.5 , for simplicity .",
    "the other important factor is that the experimental tunneling spectra were taken under the condition of constant tunneling current . in all the experiment measurements ,",
    "the spectra were taken with the same initial tunneling current ( e.g. , @xmath60pa ) at some bias voltage @xmath61 ( e.g. , @xmath62mv ) .",
    "so there was a normalization process using the integral area of sample ldos from 0 to @xmath61 of each curve if we simply considered the tip ldos as a constant.@xcite such normalization makes very little change of the tip height which can be omitted because the tunneling current decays exponentially with increasing of height .",
    "this means that ldos obtained theoretically should be normalized in accordance with the experimental condition of constant current .",
    "this is carried out by rescaling the amplitude of ldos for each site so that the energy integral of ldos between @xmath58 to -20 mev becomes a constant for the negative parts of calculations have fewer features .",

    "@xcite . however , a large numerical cost of solving bogoliubov - de gennes equation limits the accessible energy scale .",
    "if we try to reproduce the experimental gap size , the self - consistency calculation becomes unstable or unrealistic suffered from the finite - size effect of the available lattice .",
