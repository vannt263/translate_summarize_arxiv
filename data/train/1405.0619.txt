    "correlation and interference distinguish quantum from classical physics .",
    "the former is manifest in the measurement of many - body coincidences predicted by a quantum joint probability density function ( pdf ) .",
    "the latter is most familiar as a one - body pdf for an outcome that can be achieved in at least two indistinguishable ways .",
    "however , interference can also be generated by superposing many - body states in indistinguishable ways @xcite .",
    "quantum correlation between a particle and the center of mass ( cm ) of the potential well in which it is trapped or the cm of a barrier over which it traverses is described here . when the incident and reflected two - body wavefunctions overlap",
    ", correlated interference occurs .",
    "this is calculated for the particle and well or barrier all having non - zero rest mass and with motion in free space along one dimension .",
    "a single - body treatment of a particle in both of these potentials is familiar from a first exposure to quantum mechanics .",
    "however , the two - body quantum effects on the particle and cm of the well or barrier , including correlated interference and the `` kinematic '' effects ( e.g. recoil ) due to the interaction , have not been discussed in the literature as far as we know .",
    "we also develop a formalism to describe asynchronous measurement of the particle and well or barrier , the predictions of which are not needed in a single - body treatment .    for a particle traversing a barrier , in a single - body treatment , a refractive index is often used to parametrize the wavefunction ; an example of which is the neutron wavefunction traversing a barrier consisting of a slab of matter @xcite .",
    "the analogous classical example is given by an electromagnetic wave traversing a slab of glass , where again an index of refraction is used to parametrize the interaction .",
    "the controversy involved with the form of the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor for the electromagnetic wave interacting with matter has a long history and involved many well known physicists of the twentieth century @xcite .",
    "the analogous quantum result , presented here for the two - body solution , is shown to involve a simple division of kinetic energy and momentum between the particle and barrier .",
    "a simpler yet similar two - body problem occurs for reflection of a particle from a mirror @xcite . correlated interference in such reflection is an example of perhaps the simplest interferometer , utilizing neither division of amplitude nor division of wavefront methods to generate interference , with path lengths which need not be carefully matched for interference to be manifest .",
    "the two - body interaction of a particle with a barrier has effects similar to the particle - mirror interaction : transfer of coherence and the possibility of extending the quantum - classical boundary to a macroscopic mass . here , however , the focus is on correlated interference and the predictions of synchronous and asynchronous measurements due to the interaction of the particle with the well or barrier .",
    "the consequences for asynchronous measurements of a particle reflecting from a mirror have been discussed @xcite .",
    "a synopsis of this work is as follows .",
    "first an overview is given to place the model for calculating asynchronous correlation in context .",
    "this model is then shown to conserve probability .",
    "next energy eigenstate solutions to the schrdinger equation for both the well and barrier potentials , modified to include non - simultaneous measurements , are derived .",
    "the superposition principle is then used to form reflected particle - well or particle - barrier wavegroups .",
    "predictions from this non - simultaneous joint pdf in the limit of simultaneous measurements are described .",
    "this is then related to the predictions for measurement of the particle followed by measurement of the well or barrier .",
    "particularly emphasis is on the correlated interference or overlap region of the incident and reflected particle - well or particle - barrier wavegroups where it is shown that asynchronous measurement of the particle acts as a `` beamsplitter '' for the well or barrier .",
    "a common example of quantum correlation utilizes conservation of angular momentum in particle decay for an isolated system in an eigenstate of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the angular momentum of one decay product then always results in the second exhibiting an angular momentum consistent with the initial angular momentum state of the system . since this property of the second particle",
    "can be measured simultaneously with that of the first it is often used as fodder for a discussion about transmitting signals faster than the speed of light @xcite .    by analogy",
    ", one might wonder if this `` instantaneous collapse '' extends to non - simultaneous measurements .",
    "if so , predictions would then be determined by the following sequence : measurement of one particle is followed by the immediate collapse of the other particle s substate , this second particle s substate then time evolves from its collapsed state , and finally another measurement is made on only the second particle .",
    "such reasoning is based on the assumption that measurement of the first particle collapses the substate of the second particle .",
    "we argue that this assumption is incorrect : a measurement of one substate does not collapse all substates of the system .",
    "a more concrete illustration utilizes the angular momentum example mentioned above .",
    "let the initial _ system _ not be in an eigenstate of angular momentum .",
    "a measurement on one particle then does not require a unique angular momentum for the second particle since the system is not in an eigenstate of angular momentum .",
    "yet by definition , collapse produces only one of the eigenstates of the operator corresponding to the measured observable .",
    "if an angular momentum measurement on the first particle s substate yields a particular value then into what unique value of angular momentum does the second particle collapse ?",
    "there never was a well defined angular momentum of the _ system _ to constrain the answer .",
    "yet the answer is needed , in the procedure described above , as an initial condition to determine the time evolution of the second particle until it is actually measured .",
    "however , only a measurement of the angular momentum of both particles collapses the wavefunction of the system into a unique angular momentum state and therefore satisfies the definition of a measurement of the system .",
    "the sum of simultaneous measurements on each particle yields the angular momentum of the system .    in forming a model which does not rely on the assumption of simultaneous collapse",
    "it is useful to review the procedure for determining the results of a measurement of each position simultaneously in a two - body system .",
    "this is given by the two - body joint pdf integrated over the spatial extent of each detector .",
    "building on this result , we propose that a measurement of the position of the two particles at different times is given by the joint pdf evaluated over the spatial extent of each detector at the times each is measured .",
    "note that the system is measured only once .",
    "there is no collapse and re - measurement of either particle nor of the system . to prevent correlations from occurring after the first particle is measured it",
    "is assumed that there is no interaction during the time evolution between measurements .    to account for different temporal measurements of the particle and well or barrier , respective time parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "are introduced .",
    "these are used both to distinguish between the energies of the particle and the well or barrier in the expression for the wavefunctions ( as opposed to using only the total energy ) and to label the different times at which the particle and well or barrier are measured .",
    "they do not indicate evolution of the subsystems via different hamiltonians as do the different time variables used by mcguire @xcite .",
    "they neither tick at different rates nor are they out of phase , but rather act as only a label , just as @xmath2 and @xmath3 label the particle and well or barrier spatial coordinates along the @xmath4 axis .",
    "using particle and well or barrier coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 , masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and initial velocities @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively , the two - body schrdinger equation , @xmath9 \\notag \\\\ + i\\partial_{t})\\psi[x_{1},x_{2},t]=0 \\label{eq : scheqn1time}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is then written as @xmath10 \\notag \\\\",

    "the difference between these equations is that the time rate of change of @xmath11 in the first equation , proportional to the total energy of the system , is separated into a term proportional to the energy of the particle _ plus _ that of the well or barrier in the second equation .",
    "the sum of the two time derivative terms in equation [ eq : scheqn2times ] is equal to the one time derivative term in equation [ eq : scheqn1time ] .",
    "both equations express conservation of energy but parse it differently .    to illustrate the utility of such notation",
    "consider calculating the expectation value of the particle s energy using one - time notation , written as @xmath12 .",
    "this of course yields a total energy of the system rather than that of the particle and therefore is not what would be measured .",
    "however , @xmath13 gives the appropriate energy expectation value of the particle .",
    "a similar result follows for the well or barrier .    the probability of measuring the particle at @xmath14 and the well or barrier at @xmath15 is then given by @xmath16 dx_{1 } dx_{2}$ ] with the joint pdf determined by the solution of equation [ eq : scheqn2times ] as @xmath17 .",

    "examples of such asynchronous predictions are shown below in figs .",

    "although the time intervals per snapshot are the same for both figures , more snapshots are shown as a vertical progression in part ( b ) .",
    "the resulting time dependent pdf along the @xmath3 axis for fixed @xmath2 and @xmath0 is a consequence of two well substates of different energies being generated from the reflection of the particle standing wave ( which itself consists of waves traveling in opposite directions with different energies ) .",

    "total destructive correlated interference of the two - body wavegroups , traveling in opposite directions in the @xmath117 plane , corresponds to positions where the particle and well or barrier can never be found .",

    "another constraint on the interference is that the fringe visibility function must be non - zero .",
    "that is , the incident and reflected two - body wavegroups must ` overlap ' within approximately a longitudinal coherence length @xcite , which is given by @xmath140 @xcite . for particle substates this can be @xmath141   for ultracold atoms @xcite or @xmath142   for slow neutrons @xcite .    in this localized region of type",
    "i correlated interference , simultaneous measurement is then confined both to a size determined by the two coherence lengths and a temporal duration given by the time during which the wavegroups overlap .",
    "the former is small for macroscopic barrier masses while the duration of the interference is essentially determined by the speed of the particle and its coherence length , @xmath143 for a static barrier when @xmath144 .",
    "one method to reduce these coherence length limitations is with type ii correlation interference , an example of which is peak @xmath23 in figs .",
    "[ fig : barrier_negenergy ] and [ fig : barrier_posenergy ] . in this case",
    "the interfering two - body wavegroups travel in the same direction in the @xmath117 plane after ` reflection ' from the two barrier edges and are therefore no longer confined to a small region of space .",
    "a practical example is in retro - reflection of a neutron from each of the two surfaces of a moving aluminum ` slab ' .",
    "this non - local two - body interference is to be contrasted with the local correlated interference just discussed and is similar to that of a pulse of light retro - reflecting from a thin film where destructive interference depends neither on the locations of the detector nor the thin film .",
    "the physical difference between neutron - slab correlated destructive interference and this classical example is that in the former case neither the reflected neutron nor slab can be measured simultaneously whereas in the latter case only the pulse of light can not be measured due to destructive interference .",
    "a more detailed discussion of such non - local interference and of issues associated with possible potential experimental verification of the correlated interference results presented here is similar to those for a particle reflecting from a mirror @xcite .",
    "other similarities discussed in these references and relevant to the interaction of a particle with a well or barrier are : measurement of the particle but not the barrier or well , distortion of the wavegroups upon reflection , transfer of coherence between the particle and well or barrier , and the possibility of extending the quantum - classical boundary to a macroscopic mass using correlated interference .    the two body solution for the particle and well or barrier system , @xmath73 $ ] ,",
    "is given in terms of its subsystem parameters .",
    "operators for the _ system _ therefore involve combining subsystem operators .",
    "for example , the center of mass position operator for the system is given by @xmath145 .",
    "this sum must generate a position eigenvalue which agrees with that expected for the cm motion of the classical system , which under the assumptions given is not influenced by any external potentials . to satisfy these constraints ,",
    "both subsystem positions must be measured simultaneously since an asynchronous measurement leads to different cm positions determined by the different times the particle and well or barrier are measured .",
    "therefore operators for a system observable must act on @xmath73|_{t_{1}=t_{2}}$ ] . in all cases , including tunneling through the barrier , the momentum and energy eigenvalues of the system are then real even though the subsystem momentum of the particle and barrier may be complex or one of the subsystem energies may be negative .",
