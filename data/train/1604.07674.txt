    "the solar wind ( sw ) plasma , an ideal laboratory for the study of collisionless plasma dynamics , is mostly found in a turbulent state  @xcite .",
    "subproton - scale ( `` dissipation range '' ) turbulence in the sw has become a major research topic over the past decade , both for in - situ satellite measurements  @xcite and for numerical  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies .",
    "spacecraft observations provide important constraints on turbulent spectra , revealing the presence of breaks in the electromagnetic fluctuations around the proton kinetic scales  @xcite . at subproton scales , typical slopes for the magnetic energy spectrum are found to be in the range @xmath2 $ ] , while preliminary results about its electric counterparts are in the range @xmath3 $ ] . from a theoretical point of view , possible explanations for the observed spectra are the development of a kinetic alfvn wave ( kaw ) cascade and/or a whistler cascade  @xcite .",
    "however , the predicted energy spectra are the same for the two cases and thus auxiliary methods have been suggested in order to identify the exact nature of turbulent fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "observational evidence points towards a kaw - dominated scenario for a @xmath4 plasma  @xcite ( @xmath1 is the ratio between the thermal and the magnetic pressures ) , although contradictory results have also been reported  @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies , on the other hand , have suggested that oblique kaws and whistlers could coexist as the plasma parameters vary in space and time  @xcite .",
    "so far , numerical simulations have focused only on one scenario at a time , not on a possible coexistence or a transition between those cascades , leaving such a question as an open problem in sw turbulence research .    in this letter",
    ", we wish to tackle the fundamental question of a possible dependence of the physics of subproton - scale kinetic turbulence on the plasma @xmath1 parameter by carrying out high - resolution 2d3v simulations of forced plasma turbulence as described by a hybrid vlasov  maxwell ( hvm ) model with fluid electrons .",
    "while not retaining electron kinetic effects , this approach allows for both kaws and whistlers to be present , and it fully captures the ion kinetic physics . besides , this 2d3v setting allows us to include large `` fluid '' scales while still fully resolving subproton scales , which is not currently possible in 3d3v due to computational limitations .",
    "due to the intrinsic anisotropy of the turbulent mhd cascade , and to the strong damping of the parallel modes via resonances  @xcite , we also expect such `` 2.5d '' simulations to retain some important dynamical features of the fully 3d case .",
    "in the hvm model , fully kinetic ions are coupled with massless fluid electrons  @xcite . the hvm equations normalized with respect to the ion mass @xmath5 , the ion gyrofrequency @xmath6 , the alfvn speed @xmath7 and the ion skin depth @xmath8 are given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the ion distribution function , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electric and magnetic fields , respectively , and @xmath13 is the current density .",

    "while it may overestimate the actual compressible component of the driving in the sw context , this choice can be justified by the lack of scale separation in the simulations between the driving and ion scales , at which a mixture of compressible and incompressible fluctuations is found in the solar wind  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the average power input of @xmath33 is @xmath34 and the forcing acts on the smallest wave numbers of the system , @xmath35 , thus injecting energy only at the largest scales admitted by our numerical box . in the following ,",
    "we consider three different initial plasma beta values ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and a temperature ratio @xmath39 , i.e. , typical of sw parameters .",
    "we use @xmath40 uniformly distributed grid points to discretize a squared simulation box with @xmath41 , corresponding to a resolution @xmath42 .",

    "we first investigate the spectral properties of the statistically quasi - steady turbulent state and whether they reproduce the phenomenology expected for kaws or whistlers .",

    "the local in - plane magnetic field turns out to be randomly oriented in the fully turbulent regime , and the spectra are globally isotropic in the @xmath57-plane . therefore a shell - averaging technique can be adopted in that spectral plane ( @xmath58-reduction ) , without being polluted by any preferential direction . moreover , spectra are time - averaged over about @xmath59 .    in fig .",

[",

    "second , we check if the relation @xmath93 ( with @xmath94 ^ 2 $ ] ) between the density and parallel magnetic spectra , expected for kaw fluctuations , is satisfied  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : spectra_kaw - or - whistler_a ] we compare the magnetic and the normalized density spectra , @xmath62 and @xmath89 , as obtained in our simulations .",
    "the main result is that the turbulence is mediated by magnetosonic / whistler ( ms / w ) fluctuations at @xmath36 , whereas the dynamics at @xmath73 appear to be dominated by alfvn wave / kinetic alfvn wave ( aw / kaw ) turbulence . at @xmath65 , instead",
    ", there is a signature of a transition at @xmath95 , from a ms to a kaw regime . in order to confirm this scenario , in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_kaw - or - whistler_b ] we show the comparison between @xmath71 and @xmath96 . in particular , at @xmath36 ,",
    "a significant disagreement between the two quantities remains even at @xmath44 , thus providing a confirmation of the whistler - dominated regime inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra_kaw - or - whistler_a ] . at @xmath73 ,",
    "we find @xmath93 through the entire @xmath58 range , thus confirming the kaw - dominated scenario . at @xmath65 , @xmath71 and @xmath96 differ by more than an order of magnitude for @xmath97 , whereas the relation @xmath93 holds well for @xmath67 .",
    "this supports the interpretation of a transition from an ms dynamics at large scales to a kaw regime at smaller scales , for @xmath65 ( see also sec .  [ subsec : interpret ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : damping_kaw - whistler ] ) .",
    "further evidence leading to the above conclusions is provided by inspecting the magnetic compressibility , @xmath98 , and by the predominantly perpendicular heating of the ions at low @xmath1 , @xmath99 ( not shown here ) .",
    "we finally caution that these results may be dependent on the details of how the turbulence is driven .",
    "while we concluded from several test simulations ( not shown ) that the qualitative results presented here do not depend significantly on the resolution and/or on the forcing amplitude , we also found that ms / w waves are not excited in complementary test simulations conducted with a purely incompressible ( perhaps somewhat idealized ) driving ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) .",

    "the frequency - normalized damping rates of the two modes are comparable and an extrapolation to the turbulent state is not obvious ( a comparison of just @xmath119 would show a slightly higher damping of the ms / w branch , but still of the same order of magnitude ) . however , in this regime the aw / kaw mode is not completely absorbed anymore by the ion cyclotron resonance , consistent with a kaw - dominated cascade inferred from the simulations .    at @xmath65 , instead , the frequency - normalized damping rates exhibit a transition at @xmath120 : for @xmath121 , the aw / kaw branch is more damped than the ms / w counterpart , whereas at @xmath122 the contrary holds ( this transition is much more pronounced in the pure damping rates , @xmath119 ) .",

    "the spectral properties of the simulated turbulence , such as power - law exponents and spectral breaks at ion scales , are in agreement with the existing theory of subproton - scale turbulence and close to the observed sw spectra .",
    "moreover , we find that small - scale turbulence in this driven 2d3v setup mainly involves magnetosonic / whistler fluctuations at low @xmath1 , and kaws at somewhat higher @xmath1 .",
    "we found that this transition correlates with a change in the relative strength of the damping of the underlying wave modes , suggesting that cyclotron - resonant damping may be relevant in this context .",
    "we point out that this scenario is not mutually exclusive of other important effects involving nonlinearities , such as the presence of coherent structures also spotted in the simulations , and they can in fact be coupled with each other .",
