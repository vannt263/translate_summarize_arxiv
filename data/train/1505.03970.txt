    "it is actually possible to take @xmath26 so that @xmath27 is a @xmath17 manifold and @xmath28 is a @xmath17 diffeomorphism for each @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the interior of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , however we here do not require any regularity of @xmath33 manifolds @xmath27 in our definition of semialgebraic triangulation",
    ". instead , we are concerned with the differentiability ( the regularity ) of @xmath34 along the boundary @xmath35 .",
    "our main theorem is the following :    [ thm1 ] for a locally closed semialgebraic set @xmath2 , there exists a semialgebraic triangulation @xmath26 so that the map @xmath24 is of class @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath26 in the theorem a _ semialgebraic triangulation of @xmath2 with @xmath0 realization_. it follows that @xmath34 is a semialgebraically homeomorphic to the closed simplex @xmath36 and the differential @xmath37 exists and is continuous on @xmath31 , while as a cost for that , @xmath37 may drop the rank along the boundary @xmath35 and some smaller dimensional semialgebraic subset of @xmath30 .",
    "the proof is quite elementary , only using standard techniques such as triangulation , tube and the curve selection lemma ( some basic facts are summarized in section 2 ) , so it would be completely readable even for non - experts .",
    "it will be described in the case over @xmath4 , but will carefully be done to be valid for any general real closed field @xmath38 . therefore , theorem [ thm1 ] is true in the context of @xmath5-category ( or o - minimal category ) over any @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , our argument fits with the framework of a wider class of sets , called _ piecewise algebraic spaces _",
    ", introduced in @xcite ( remark [ pa ] ) .",
    "there remain some open questions .",
    "for instance , we do not know whether or not @xmath39 can be of class @xmath17 ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) ; whether or not we can choose @xmath39 so that the restriction to @xmath30 is a semialgebraic @xmath0 embedding for each @xmath29",
    ". as known , any whitney stratified set is triangulable , so it would be natural to ask if the realization map @xmath39 can be of @xmath0 ; it , however , seems not true in general , for our proof heavily depends on the semialgebraicity .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    we discuss an elementary application in differential geometry .",
    "let @xmath42 be a semialgebraic manifold and @xmath2 a compact semialgebraic subset of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "take a semialgebraic triangulation @xmath26 of @xmath2 with @xmath0 realization . here",
    "@xmath23 is a finite simplicial complex . for a differential @xmath44-form @xmath45 and a @xmath44-simplex @xmath29 ,",
    "the integral of @xmath3 on @xmath31 is defined in an obvious way by @xmath46 because the map @xmath47 is of class @xmath0 ( the integral is often written by @xmath48 for short ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 has the @xmath49-fundamental class .",
    "put @xmath50 where the sum runs over all @xmath44-simplices @xmath31 in @xmath23 with suitable orientation so that they form the fundamental cycle .",
    "it is almost obvious that the value @xmath51 does not depend on the choice of @xmath26 of @xmath2 ( theorem [ thm3 ] ) .",
    "cosequently , the theory of integration of differential forms over semialgebraic sets can be treated in entirely the same manner as in the case of manifolds  that simplifies the treatment of semialgebraic chains and integrations , without using the geometric measure theory @xcite ( remarks [ current ] , [ cdga ] ) .",
    "we remark that our definition of @xmath1 works over not only the real number field @xmath4 but also any possibly non - archimedian real closed field @xmath38 .",
    "then the value of the integral does no longer stay in the same field @xmath38 , but exists in a ( larger ) saturated field , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , the volume of a bounded definable set in @xmath52 is bounded within @xmath38 ( remark [ o_minimal ] ) .    [ [ section-2 ] ]    this work was originally motivated by a question of tatsuo suwa about the definition of @xmath1 using triangulation .",
