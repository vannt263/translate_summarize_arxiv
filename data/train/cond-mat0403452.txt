    "1a ) ; it is well known since @xcite that the bending stresses can be relaxed by a set of dislocations of density @xmath0 , where r is the radius of curvature and b the burgers vector .",

    "1b ) the layers of atoms parallel to the burgers vector keep practically unstrained , and the largest contribution to the strain energy comes from the cores of the dislocations .",
    "the repeat distance in a direction perpendicular to the burgers vector is conserved and the atoms have almost the same density along the curved layer as in the unbent crystal ; the curvature can be large .",
    "the same geometry transposed to a layered liquid , a smectic a ( sma ) , shows that the curvature deformation is compensated by liquid relaxation along the layers , fig .",
    "1c @xcite . transposed to a columnar phase ,",
    "the columns curvature is such that their equidistance and parallelism are conserved , which implies that they are orthogonal to a family of planes ; the 2d network of their intersections with any of those planes is unchanged compared to the undeformed state @xcite . in a sense it is still feasible to speak of dislocations in lamellar and columnar phases , but they now have a vanishing burgers vector , their density is infinite , and there is no analogue to polygonization . the energy of deformation is pure curvature energy ; the mass density is conserved .",
    "such deformations , we shall call them _ isometric _ , in the sense that they do not affect the solid component of the ordered liquid , i.e. the distance between lamellae or between columns . in the columnar case",
    ", they also are _",
    "@xmath2    isometric deformations are commonplace in 1d and 2d liquid crystals .",
    "it is an easy matter to show that they must dominate on scales larger than @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a typical frank curvature modulus and @xmath5 a typical inverse compressibility , _",
    "i.e. _ on scales larger than a few repeat distances @xcite .",
    "they form characteristic textures that carry singularity sets .",
    "the case of smectics has been known for more than a century @xcite ; the relevant isometric textures are _ focal conic domains _ , which are singular on a pair of conjugate conics , the layers take the shape of _ dupin cyclides_. in columnar phases the isometric textures are _ developable domains _",
    "@xcite , which are singular on a developable surface ; the columns can be partitioned ( in an infinity of ways ) into families of parallel lines belonging to _",
    "monge surfaces_. we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite , chapter 10 , for a full description .",
    "it is a remarkable fact that these objects , whose geometry is so precisely defined , extend over mesoscopic scales , quite often of the order of a mm , _",
    "i.e. _ involving 10@xmath6 to 10@xmath7 strictly parallel layers in a sma .",
    "this indicates the extension of the isometric principle in ordered liquids .",
    "let us come now to a newcomer in the realm of mesomorphic structures , namely the b7 phase .",
    "it is widely accepted that the structure of this phase involves at the same time a smectic layering ( sm ) and a one - dimensional modulation ( d ) of the layers @xcite ( we call ` columns ' the elements of this modulation , in a metaphoric sense ; we denote by @xmath8 their unit tangent vector ; the symbol d stands for ` order of the columnar type ' , as with discotic thermotropic molecules ) .",
    "it is believed that the b7 order is built upon a low - symmetry , chiral , molecular configuration brand , although the molecules are non - chiral . these molecules are planar and bent - like , with a rather strong dipole moment along an axis of symmetry , fig .",
    "2 . therefore",
    "domains of opposite chiralities coexist in the ground state .",
    "but at a mesoscopic level , notwithstanding this _ chiral _ character of the structure , the ground state does not exhibit _ helicity _ ( only sm and d orders are simultaneously present ) .",
    "observe that the lamellar structure allows that the modulations of neighboring layers keep in register , yielding thus close - packing and high mass density .",
    "were it limited to these two types of order , sm+d , one would expect that the textures of lower energy , _",
    "i.e. _ , the isometric distortions , although somewhat more subtle than the isometric distortions of sets of parallel 2d liquid layers or of parallel 1d liquid columns , would not require an analysis of a degree of difficulty much deeper , in the sense that no new geometrical concept would be necessary @xcite .",
    "a most conspicuous feature of the b7 phase is the presence of _ helical ribbons _",
    "( hr ) that appear in the isotropic phase when the samples are cooled down rapidly from the high temperature range of the isotropic phase walba , bedel , yunastishin , jakli , coleman .",
    "these nuclei clearly display a double - helix texture , fig .",
    "3 . left and right hrs are in approximately equal numbers . a linear relation between the pitch @xmath9 and the width",
    "@xmath10 has been documented by several authors @xcite . the model for hrs proposed by coleman & _",
    "@xcite consists in two cylinders , made of tightly packed cylindrical layers , twisted one about the other .",
    "this model is in full agreement with the sm+d structure of the b7 phase , but is not isometric , in the sense that the twisting of the two cylinders hinders close - packing .",
    "@xmath11    there are in fact two types of hrs @xcite .",
    "the s - hrs ( slim ) are characterized by a rather perfect double helical geometry , a pitch / width @xmath12 ratio @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and a high rigidity ; they do not bend easily , which is related to the remarkable constancy of the pitch and of the @xmath14 ratio all along each ribbon .",
    "the f - hrs ( fat ) are much more disperse in pitch , shape , and width .",
    "we shall in this note expatiate only on s - hrs , ( simply noted hrs in the sequel ) .",
    "we present in the next section a purely geometric model , which interprets hrs as isometric textures of the b7 phase ; and explains satisfactorily well their double helical geometry and the value of the ratio @xmath15 . in particular , the model is such that the modulation of any b7 twisted layer does match the modulation of the neighboring twisted , parallel , b7 layers , as required by the isometric principle .",
    "@xmath16    the helical pitch @xmath9 varies somewhat from one nucleus to another , but about a value that is rather strongly peaked , fig .",
    "the s - hrs transform in a period of a few minutes into f - hrs .",
    "these features have led the authors of @xcite to assume that s - hrs are specific textures of metastable modifications of the b7 phase , which display helicity ( h order ) , either left or right , superimposed on sm and d orders .",
    "we note them b7@xmath17 .",
    "the axis of helicity is perpendicular to the layers and affects the columns .",
    "we thus assume that the b7@xmath17 helical states differ from b7 by the existence of a finite pitch @xmath18 of the columns , @xmath18 being a material constant .",
    "we show , in the framework of a very simple model , that the free energy is minimized when @xmath19 ( where @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , _ i.e. _ when @xmath22 which is precisely what is expected from the purely geometric model , and that this energy is less than the energy of the model advocated in @xcite .",
    "@xmath23    the next section is devoted to a detailed account of our hr geometric model ; section iii deals with an approached calculation of the hr energy , assuming the existence of a metastable b7@xmath17 phase .",
    "our isometric model is related in many ways to the three topics mentioned in the title of this subsection .",
    "we briefly expose this relationship with these topics , before ( in the next subsection ) giving a more detailed account of it .",
    "let us first summarize the main features which characterize a hr according to our model : a hr is the inner part of a giant burgers vector screw dislocation ; the layers are deployed along parallel and equidistant helicoids whose common axis is the dislocation line and whose pitch is equal to the burgers vector ; the columns are along parallel helices of the same axis and belong to the helicoids .",
    "the singularity set of this isometric texture is made of a double helix located at the periphery of the whole texture .",
    "5 is a mathematical illustration of the model ; see also fig .",
    "8 of @xcite .",
    "@xmath24    screw dislocations with giant burgers vectors are documented in smas since long @xcite ; they are characterized by the fact that the core is split into two helical singularities located at a distance @xmath20 from the axis of the screw , @xmath9 being its burgers vector ; this geometry is visible under the optical microscope , @xmath9 being so large ( typically a few @xmath25 in cbooa , a classic thermotropic smectic ; the burgers vector is not related to any material constant , but rather to the circumstances of the experiment , very probably the thickness of the sample ) .",
    "this geometry can be explained as follows @xcite .",
    "the sma layers form a set of _ parallel _ , _ equidistant _ surfaces ( isometric principle ! ) , which are nested helicoids , stacked upon a central _ ruled helicoid _ whose axis is along the screw line ; it has a right or left hand , according to the case , analytically distinguished by the sign of @xmath26 .",
    "a ruled helicoid is generated by a straight - line meeting a fixed axis at a right angle and moving with a uniform helical motion about this axis ; it has a vanishing mean curvature:@xmath27    the two singularities are the cuspidal edges of the focal surfaces of the set of helicoids ; they act physically as two helical _ disclinations _ of strength @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) , about which the layers fold . outside the cylindrical region bound by the disclinations ,",
    "the layers adopt a quasi - planar geometry that is not in analytical continuity with the helicoids inside , but are in register with the layers inside .",
    "we argue that the b7@xmath17 layers in the hr stack as those of the sma phase in the screw dislocation .",
    "the geometric properties of the layer stacking impose that the disclination lines are scribed on a cylinder of diameter @xmath29 .",
    "this is precisely what one observes empirically in the b7@xmath17 case , taking for @xmath10 the measured diameter of the hr .",
    "but there are differences .",
    "the hr is limited to the core region , inside the cylinder on which the disclinations are scribed , whereas the sma screw dislocation extends outside the core region . also , it is precisely the helicity of the columns ( no columns in the sma phase , of course ) that stabilizes the hr .",
    "the screw dislocation is a _",
    "metastable _ defect of the sma phase .",
    "the hr , on the other hand , see next section , is the texture of _ lowest energy _ of the frustrated metastable b7@xmath17 phase .    the hrs bear also some resemblance with a model @xcite devised in order to explain the conformation of the molecule of dna in the chromosome of dinoflagellate , observed by livolant & bouligand @xcite .",
    "the same observations also attracted the attention of j. friedel , who concluded to a much similar model @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the dna is cholesteric in this chromosome , but at the same time the isometric principle , which applies here because the persistence length of the molecule is not negligible compared to the cholesteric pitch , requires that the local packing be as dense as possible .",
    "ref@xcite discusses precisely the possibility of the coexistence of cholesteric and 2d local order , which _ a priori _ are incompatible in the large , but , as it was shown , can be fitted locally if the molecules can be partitioned into a family of parallel , helical , surfaces containing their long direction .",
    "here sits the analogy with hr .",
    "but whereas the columns are along helices in a hr , it is believed that the dna molecules ( but to shape fluctuations ) are along a set of lines orthogonal to these helices , namely a set of geodesics .    in b7@xmath17",
    "the columns sit along helices with approximately the opposite pitch to the layers pitch ; thus , they display the well - known blue phase ( bp ) _ double - twist _ geometry . in the case of bps , this geometry is not related to the presence of any layers : the columns are in fact liquid - like in the three directions , and the order parameter is locally cholesteric .",
    "double - twist is splayless and its bend energy is relatively small , as long as the lateral size of the bundle of double - twisted molecules does not exceed @xmath30 ( the double - twist geometry is frustrated ) . it has been stressed @xcite that in ideal double - twist geometry , the columns are equidistant , having the same property of equidistance met _ e.g. _ , for the strands of a string .",
    "it is such a property we expect that the columns of the b7@xmath17 phase do satisfy , with the result that the elastic energy is not prohibitive .",
    "how this requirement relates to helical layers is discussed now .",
    "but whereas most people think of the double - twist geometry as geometry of nested cylinders , into which the columns are partitioned , the screw dislocation model drives us to partition the hr geometry into helical surfaces .",
    "we shall come again to the nature of this discrepancy , which is not as trivial as it might look at first sight .",
    "helicoids possess a property that they share with surfaces of revolution : they are invariant under a _",
    "one - parameter family of _",
    "@xcite , namely a continuous set of translation - rotations about the helical axis ( for helicoids ) , a continuous set of rotations about the axis of revolution ( for surfaces of revolution ) .",
    "of course the circular cylinder ( limit case of a helicoid for @xmath31 ) and the sphere possess respectively two- and three - parameter families of rigid motions , but we leave aside these limit cases , that are trivial .",
    "less trivial is the fact that surfaces of the type under consideration , namely helicoids ( resp . surfaces of revolution ) , contain two orthogonal families of curves of which one family is the family of helices ( resp .",
    "circles of latitude ) whereas the other one consists of geodesics ( resp .",
    "meridians ) .",
    "this is exactly the geometrical property we are looking for : if one installs the columns of the b7@xmath17 phase along the curves orthogonal to the geodesics , then the columns stay at equal distances , because of the property of _ frontality _ of the geodesics .",
    "the demonstration of the existence of two orthogonal families of curves hilbert requires the recognition that the rigid motion invariance is also invariance under a _",
    "one - parameter family of _ .",
    "a surface admits bending invariance if the following is true .",
    "place , snug against the surface , a piece of flexible but not stretchable foil ; then it can be displaced along the surface , at least along one direction , so that it keeps snug against it without tearing , although it can change its shape .",
    "if the surface admits a one - parameter family of bendings , then there are curves , which cover the whole surface , such that the displacements along those curves exhibit the above property of invariance . because bending does not change geodesic distance",
    ", any two curves of the family must be at a constant geodesic distance .",
    "therefore a geodesic line orthogonal to one of the curve of the first family crosses at right angles all the curves of the first family .",
    "because bending keeps gaussian curvature invariant , gaussian curvature is constant all along a curve of the first family .",
    "gaussian curvatures measured along two curves of the first family are generically different .",
    "therefore the curves of the first family do not cross ; they form a family without singular points .",
    "this first family of lines is a set of helices .",
    "it can indeed be shown hilbert that surfaces admitting a one - parameter family of bendings can be brought into the form of general helicoids or of surfaces of revolution .",
    "most evidently the curves of the first family are the helices ( resp .",
    "the circles of latitude ) , and no other curves .",
    "therefore the condition of equidistance ( more precisely : of equal geodesic distance ) forces the columns to sit along the helices of general helicoids ( resp . along the circles of latitude of surfaces of revolution ) .",
    "the physical layers , which are deployed along these helicoids , have to be parallel in order to minimize compression energy .",
    "we are thus led to study sets of parallel general helicoids , and their helices .",
    "the property of columns equidistance , which is preserved in each individual helicoid , is still true for columns belonging to different parallel helicoids . in effect , consider two neighboring parallel surfaces h and h at a distance @xmath32 measured along their common normals . let@xmath33be",
    "the gaussian and mean curvatures at some point m on h. @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constant along the helix h passing through m on h , and depend upon the unique parameter that defines the helix .",
    "two parallel surfaces have the same centers of curvature c@xmath36 and c@xmath37 at corresponding points , say m ( on h ) and m ( on h ) .",
    "therefore@xmath38    thus the gaussian and mean curvatures @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constant along the curve h drawn on the surface h by the normals leaning on the first helix h. therefore h is invariant under a one - parameter family of bendings ; it is indeed a helicoid , as already stated . on the other hand , h , which by construction is at a constant distance @xmath32 of h ,",
    "is an helix on h , and thus belongs to a family of equidistant curves on h , all obtained by tracing the curves h(@xmath32 ) equidistant to the helices h.    this property explains why the isometric principle is satisfied not only on each helicoid separately , but also throughout the whole hr .",
    "notice that the columns are not parallel , but anyway equidistant , which allows the modulations to fit tightly from one layer to the next .",
    "it is fully evident that a tight fitting is not feasible with planar parallel layers .",
    "a parallel stacking of helicoids on a ruled helicoid has been considered in @xcite .",
    "we revisit the corresponding analytical description , but the detailed calculations , already in @xcite , will not be given .",
    "the next section will be devoted to the calculation of the energy of such an assembly of layers , and its comparison with a cylindrical stacking , which yields a somewhat comparable but in fact fundamentally different assembly of helical columns .",
    "this subsection gives the analytical expressions necessary to calculate the energy of a hr ( next section ) ; it is mostly technical , and can be skipped in a first reading .",
    "note however the equations [ eq : h0 ] and [ eq : hlam ] , for the notations which are used ; they give the expressions of the central ruled helicoid h(0 ) and of any parallel helicoid h(@xmath39 ) at a distance @xmath39 .",
    "equations [ eq : npolar ] and [ eq : ncartes ] give the coordinates of the tangent unit vector @xmath8 along the helices ( the columns ) ; the important point is that @xmath8 is rotationally invariant about the @xmath40-axis , which lets suppose that the description of a hr in terms of nested cylinders is as valid a description as in terms of nested helicoids .",
    "in fact , it is not so ; we will discuss later on why .",
    "let @xmath39 be the signed distance of the helicoid h(@xmath39 ) to the central right helicoid h(0 ) .",
    "a point m on h(@xmath39 ) is identified by the @xmath41 and @xmath42 values of the foot on h(0 ) of the normal to h(@xmath39 ) in m. because the helicoids are parallel , they all have the same set of normals .",
    "the coordinates of a point on h(0 ) are@xmath43    those of a point on h(@xmath39 ) are @xmath44    we introduce the notation @xmath45 . the gaussian curvature and the mean curvature at m can be written@xmath46    one observes that :    ( 1)- the mean curvature vanishes for @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e_. on the central helicoid h(0 ) , fig . 5b .",
    "h(0 ) is indeed a ( ruled ) _ minimal _ surface .",
    "note that the sign of the mean curvature depends on the orientation of the normal to h(@xmath39 ) ; here we have assumed that the three vectors @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the normal @xmath50 to h(@xmath39 ) in m form a right - handed frame of reference .",
    "( 2)-the gaussian curvature is negative for @xmath51 , positive otherwise , and is infinite for @xmath52 .",
    "the region of negative gaussian curvature contains the central helicoid  since it has negative gaussian curvature ( @xmath53 )  and extends symmetrically on both sides of h(0 ) until it meets the two focal surfaces ( @xmath52 ) of the family of helicoids , i.e. , the envelop of their normals .",
    "these focal surfaces were studied in some details in @xcite ; see also mklemanlavrentovich ; we recall that each of them possesses a _",
    "helical _ singular line , around which the layers show a @xmath54 configuration .",
    "( 3)-@xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath55 depend only on @xmath41 ( not on @xmath56 ) _",
    "i.e. _ on the parameter that is a constant on a helix",
    ". therefore the curvatures properties , in particular the gaussian curvature , are constant along a given helix , which agrees with our analysis above .",
    "the coordinates of the tangent unit vector along the helices can be written:@xmath57    @xmath58 given by @xmath59    using eq.[eq : hlam ] , @xmath8 can also be written@xmath60    hence @xmath8 is a splayless ( @xmath61 ) double - twisted director field , rotationally symmetric about the @xmath40-axis .",
    "the expressions below will be used in evaluating the energy of the system:@xmath62    where @xmath63.the first equation on the second line requires @xmath64 . in the applications , we shall assume , without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "thus @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , but because @xmath69 , one gets : @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , because of the symmetry @xmath71 , the points m@xmath72 on h(+@xmath73 ) and m@xmath74 on h(@xmath39 ) are coupled by pairs that are symmetric with respect to the intersection of the segment m@xmath72m@xmath74with h(0 ) in its middle ; we restrict in the sequel to the region @xmath75 .",
    "there are two types of helicoids h(@xmath39 ) , those that are everywhere of negative gaussian curvature ( @xmath76 ) , those whose gaussian curvature changes sign ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "the sign of the gaussian curvature is negative if @xmath78  which can also be written @xmath79 .",
    "\\(1 ) - _ helicoids _ @xmath76",
    "@xmath80    these helicoids do not touch the focal surfaces .",
    "they are folded around the helical disclination @xmath28 that corresponds to the helix @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 on the helicoid h@xmath84 .",
    "the gaussian curvature is negative over the entire helicoid , when @xmath76 .",
    "\\(2 ) - _ helicoids _",
    "one distinguishes two regions    \\(a ) - negative gaussian curvature :    @xmath86    ( b)- positive gaussian curvature@xmath87      the helicoids are never physically present in their entirety in a hr ; and the physical parts of the helicoids are those which have negative gaussian curvature .",
    "the regions with positive gaussian curvature are disfavored , and the span of the helicoids is finite , for the following reasons :    ( a)- the helicoids @xmath88(which have @xmath89 ) are free of any singularity .",
    "the helical disclination @xmath28 , which is the first singularity met when proceeding away from the central axis , belongs to the helicoids @xmath90 . but the helicoids @xmath76 do not extend very far from the central axis because , as in double - twisted cylinders in blue phases , the bending energy of the columns ( energy ruled by the frank constant @xmath91 ) becomes prohibitive for large radii .",
    "which distance @xmath10 from the axis is difficult to guess at this stage ; in analogy with bp s , one could take @xmath10 @xmath92 @xmath93 which yields @xmath94 ( @xmath95 is not the distance of a helix to the axis , but the span of the helicoid ; see equation [ eq : hlam ] and appendix ) .",
    "on the other hand the observations reported in @xcite indicate that the domain of existence of the hr is not limited by a cylinder ; taking then @xmath96 ( independent of @xmath39 ) , one gets @xmath97 .",
    "equation [ eq : r ] is then replaced by@xmath98    ( b)- a solution with positive gaussian curvature has an obvious disadvantage : because the columns have a finite width , a whole number of columns does not fill the interior of a layer without void or overlapping ; and in case it succeeds to fill the interior of some layer without void or overlapping , it does not in the next one",
    ". therefore the columnar packing necessarily exhibits edge dislocations , whose energy will be estimated later on to be much larger than the energy of the helical geometry .",
    "contrariwise , the columns have space to move locally along a lateral direction if the layers have gaussian negative curvature , and in fact to take in the layers a distance of equilibrium that can be different from the distance from a layer to the next , without necessitating edge dislocations .",
    "thus , parallel helicoids are preferred to nested cylinders , although the distribution of the columns is rotationally invariant ( in a continuous analytical description ) .",
    "as already stated , the ribbons , according to @xcite , are characteristic of _ metastable _ phases b7@xmath17 ; which in addition to sm and d orders , display helicity ( h order ) , either left or right .",
    "thus the finite pitch @xmath18 @xmath99 of the columns is a material constant ( which might depend on the temperature ) . assuming this to be true , we show now , in the framework of a very simple model , that @xmath19 , _ i.e. _ @xmath100 .",
    "the free energy of a hr contains a part relative to the columns , with density @xmath101 , total energy @xmath102 , which can be written as the free energy of a cholesteric phase oriented along @xmath8 , and a part relative to the layers , layer energy density @xmath103 , total energy @xmath104 , which can be written as the free energy of a smectic phase .",
    "we shall assume that the phenomenological free energy density is a sum of these two contributions , without any term of interaction .",
    "all the interaction is indeed contained in the isometric geometry requirements : the columns are equidistant and the layers are parallel . for the same reason",
    ", we do not introduce any energy of elastic ( positional ) deformation .",
    "the helicity of a hr is described by two pseudoscalars    \\(a ) - the burgers vector @xmath9  of the dislocation , @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the smectic repeat distance .",
    "we take @xmath9 positive if the dislocation is right screw , negative in opposite case ; @xmath20 .",
    "\\(b ) - the pitch of the the twisted columns .",
    "this pitch is perpendicular to the layers .",
    "we take the pitch positive if the helicity of the columns is right handed , negative in opposite case ; @xmath107 .",
    "the cholesteric part of the energy reads    @xmath108 \\varphi _ { \\lambda } ^{\\prime 2}-2\\left [ qk_{2}+\\frac{1}{4\\varpi } k_{3}\\right ] \\varphi _ { \\lambda } ^{\\prime } + \\frac{1}{2}k_{2}q^{2 }   \\label{eq : ech}\\ ] ]    observe tat if @xmath109 , one expects @xmath110 , because the twist @xmath111 contributes to a reduction of the energy density .",
    "therefore , according to our discussion of the signs above , the inverse pitch @xmath111 , and the burgers vector @xmath9 ( which is the pitch of the helicoids ) are of opposite signs . at this level of calculation",
    "we do not specify the origin of @xmath111 when assigning a cholesteric energy density to the director field of the b7@xmath112 phase .",
    "in other words , here @xmath111 is not necessarily a material constant ( although such a possibility is not excluded ) but rather an empirical model parameter that reflects the ( metastable ) helicity of the columns in the b7@xmath17 hrs .",
    "the result given below shows that q is intimately related to the burgers vector @xmath9 .",
    "the total ` cholesteric ' energy per unit length along the axis is    @xmath113    @xmath114 is the element of area of h(@xmath39 ) .",
    "when integrating along one pitch of the helicoids , @xmath42 runs over the interval @xmath115 ; it contributes by a factor @xmath116 to the integration , since no term depends on in @xmath42  the integrand .",
    "the rest of the region of integration is a variable of the problem , which is adjusted by the competition between layer curvature effects ( discussed below ) and cholesteric contributions . in this section",
    ", we just assume that it scales like @xmath117 .",
    "this region is necessarily bound by the two sheets of the focal surface f ( the loci of the centers of curvature of the helicoids ) on which @xmath118 .",
    "starting from the central helicoid h(@xmath47 ) , the first helicoids for which this equality is obtained are h(@xmath90 ) and h(@xmath119 ) , at @xmath82 ( i.e. on the straight generators of h(@xmath47 ) , at a distance @xmath120 of the central axis ) . for the time being , and in order to avoid a difficult analytical calculation , we write @xmath121 , with @xmath122 , @xmath123,_i.e_.    @xmath124   \\label{eq : ech2}\\ ] ]    if this expression were the only energy term , one would get , by minimizing with respect to @xmath125 :    @xmath126    the sign of the @xmath127 and of the @xmath111 are opposite .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath128 is a minimum for this value of @xmath129 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath130 ) .",
    "the contribution of the layer curvature energy does not change much these results , as we show now .",
    "the layer curvature of the energy density reads :    @xmath131    @xmath132 and @xmath133 are referring to one layer .",
    "the total energy can be written :    @xmath134    @xmath106 being the layer thickness .",
    "we discuss the @xmath132 and @xmath133 term separately .    _",
    "mean curvature_. the set of stacked layers is built upon a central layer that is a minimal surface .",
    "this situation is most probably generic , because it yields such a small mean curvature energy .",
    "we shall therefore neglect the ` regular ' part of this energy , keeping only the ` singular ' part , that originates in the presence of the @xmath28 singularity at @xmath82 , @xmath135 .",
    "the disclination length is @xmath136 per turn .",
    "we thus expect an energy of the order of : @xmath137 per unit length of helical axis .    _",
    "gaussian curvature_. assume that in each layer the boundaries of the domain of existence of the phase are along two columns @xmath138 , @xmath139 . according to the gauss - bonnet theorem we have @xmath140 , with @xmath141 the geodesic curvature .",
    "the geodesic curvature vanishes for a geodesic , and takes the value @xmath142 on a helix ( a column ) , see appendix .",
    "the length of a column parameterized by @xmath41 is @xmath143 per unit length of helical axis , @xmath144being the angle of the tangent @xmath8 to the column with the plane orthogonal to the hr axis ; @xmath145 , which is positive according to our conventions .",
    "we thus expect an energy of the order of @xmath146 $ ] per unit length of helical axis for the layer h(@xmath39 ) . because @xmath147 does not depend on @xmath39 ,",
    "the contribution is the same for each layer , and the expression for one layer has to be multiplied by the number of layers @xmath148 .",
    "take @xmath149 , @xmath150 , one gets @xmath151 = \\kappa _ { b}\\pi \\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{b}$ ] .",
    "observe however that the contribution of the disclination is certainly much larger than the contribution of the gaussian curvature , the ratio being of the order of @xmath152 , where @xmath153 , and @xmath154 .",
    "we therefore neglect the @xmath155contribution and eventually get :    @xmath156    this exspression is of the same order of magnitude as , althoug presumably smaller than ( see below , after eq.[eq : inequa ] ) @xmath102 , the ratio being of the order of @xmath157 .",
    "we now minimize the total energy @xmath158 with respect to the variable @xmath159 .",
    "one gets :    @xmath160    the analysis of the stability of the solution ( which obeys @xmath161 ) , starts with the condition @xmath162 , in which inequality one inserts the value of @xmath163 for which @xmath164 .",
    "after some algebra , one finds one stable solution only    @xmath165    that gives back equation for @xmath166 .",
    "notice that the existence of such a solution requires that    @xmath167    _ i.e_. that @xmath168 be smaller than @xmath169 .",
    "this seems to be generically the case .",
    "one can indeed argue as follows .",
    "due to the anisotropy of the splay modulus , the layers most certainly fold more easily about the columns than perpendicularly to the columns .",
    "call @xmath170 the curvature of a planar section of h(@xmath39 ) perpendicular to the columns ( @xmath170 measures the folding of the layer about the columns ) , @xmath171 the curvature of a section parallel to the columns ( @xmath172 ) , one finds    @xmath173so that @xmath174 .",
    "therefore the layers are essentially folded about the columns , and the splay modulus at work is small .",
    "furthermore @xmath169 , which is the twist constant of long ( in principle infinite ) columns , is expected to be large .",
    "therefore the inequality [ eq : inequa ] is certainly satisfied , and @xmath175 of eq.eq:omegaq2 is a stable solution .    it remains to show that the above solution is much less costly than a solution with circular cylindrical layers , which would necessarily contain edge dislocations of the columns ( with burgers vectors @xmath176 , which is the columnar repeat distance .",
    "the density of such dislocations would be @xmath177 , at a distance @xmath178 from the cylinders axis .",
    "therefore the number of dislocations in a cylinder of radius @xmath127 ( which scales like their length per unit length of cylinder ) would be @xmath179 .",
    "the associated energy is of the order of @xmath180 per unit length of dislocation , _",
    "i.e_. , @xmath181 per unit length of cylinder . comparing with the energy of the hr calculated above",
    ", one gets @xmath182 . in this expression , @xmath183 is a squared microscopic length , of the same order as @xmath184",
    ". therefore @xmath185 is the ratio of a microscopic length over a macroscopic length , and is very small .",
    "isometric textures are the rule in liquid crystalline phases as soon as there is one or two dimensions of periodicity @xcite : focal conic domains when the order parameter is layer - like ( \\{sm } , one dimension of periodicity ) , developable domains when it is columnar ( \\{d } , two dimensions of periodicity ) . in both cases",
    "the associated distorted textures are metastable and carry singularities .",
    "the situation is more involved and really fascinating when is added to the periodicities a trend to helicity , \\{h}. twist grain boundary phases ( tgb ) @xcite and blue smectic phases ( bpsm ) @xcite offer remarkable examples of the \\{sm+h } mixed case ; in both cases the helicity axis is in the layer and affects the molecules .",
    "then , one gets frustrated phases , regular , periodic , with thermodynamically stable singularities ( dislocations , mostly ) .",
    "\\{h+d } frustrated phases have been suggested in @xcite ; they could display domains of parallel columns separated by twist walls , possibly observed in @xcite .",
    "the \\{sm+d } order parameter is such that the layers are modulated in thickness and fit closely along the modulations .",
    "we have demonstrated that helical ribbons are manifestations of the isometric principle for this order parameter .",
    "those hrs have a finite width and do not transform in another texture when they come into close contact .",
    "for instance , they do not extend laterally into quasi - planar layers , after the manner of the giant screw dislocations in smas , alluded to above .",
    "this extension would require a slight breaking of isometry , and the columns would no longer be twisted , just bent .",
    "it is probably this latter character that forbids such an extension . in other words",
    "the helicity seems to belong to the order parameter , which is therefore \\{sm+d+h}. but there is no way to construct in euclidean space an infinite crystal with helicity showing the same close packing as in the \\{sm+d } case ; the hrs can then be said to be frustrated textures .",
    "the \\{sm+d+h } phase is most probably crystal - definable in a curved space , but we do not have investigated this question .",
    "note however that the isometric principle could be directly applied to this curved crystal , and would then yield the hrs .",
    "it is worth mentioning another character which differentiates smas giant screw dislocations and hrs .",
    "while the hr geometry defined in section ii is experimentally strictly obeyed ( we have already mentioned the rigidity of these textures ) , the inner geometry ( inside the helical disclinations ) of a sm screw dislocation is very flexible and susceptible of many deformations .",
    "in fact , the giant screw dislocation is only an approached isometric texture for a sm phase ( the true isometric textures are focal conic domains ) , and can therefore suffer large fluctuations , in particular due to the presence of edge and screw dislocations of small burgers vectors ( @xcite , chapter 5 ) .",
    "we have mentioned the analogy between a hr and a double - twist bp cylinder . in both cases the columns ( in the bp case what we call columns are the envelops of the director field ) are double - twisted and rotationally invariant about the axis direction . because bp is a true 3d liquid",
    ", there is no obstacle to merging when two double - twist cylinders come into contact ; the director field deforms without much energy expense between cylinders , and the cylinder geometry fills space @xcite .",
    "now , as already stated , a layer helical texture is preferable to a layer cylindrical texture for a hr .",
    "there are no layers in a bp , and it is the custom to desribe this double - twist texture as if the columns are partitioned into cylinders .",
    "it is true that isometry requirements are weak in bp , as long as the molecules forming the columns are short compared to the pitch .",
    "however , it is believed that bps are favored with long molecules @xcite , and double - twist cylinders are also present in certain dna solutions livolant2 .",
    "one might therefore wonder whether a partition into parallel helicoids ( compared to nested cylinders , this requires a small displacement of the columns ) might not be closer to reality in some bps .    a final , brief , remark relating to the hr width limitation .",
    "let us notice that the region of negative gaussian curvature is bound by the focal surface of the stacking , whose two sheets obey the equation @xmath52 , see section ii , c. this is a first reason why the width stops short of the focal surface .",
    "the helical disclinations belong to the focal surfaces , which extend outwards .",
    "a second reason relates to the twist of the columns : notice , equation [ eq : curl2 ] , that @xmath186 for @xmath39 large , i.e. the twist vanishes for the helicoids that are far enough from the axis ; consequently the twist energy becomes large for @xmath39 large , if , as assumed , @xmath18 is a material constant ( metastability of the b7@xmath17 phase ) ; at the same time the bend energy decreases .",
    "observe that these behaviors of the twist and the bend energy for @xmath39 large are both opposite to their behaviors for the cylinders of double twist .",
    "but in both cases one expects that the competition between these two energy terms fixes the width of the texture at some finite value which scales with the pitch",
