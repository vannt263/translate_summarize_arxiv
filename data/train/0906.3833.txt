    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most luminous explosions in the universe .",
    "the production of grbs is believed to require that only the small amount of matter is accelerated up to ultrarelativistic speeds and collimated as a jet @xcite .",
    "the duration of grbs ranges from @xmath1 s to @xmath2 s , with a roughly bimodal distribution of long grbs of @xmath3 s and short grbs of @xmath4 s. the geometrically corrected gamma - ray energy of long grbs is typically @xmath5 ergs @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which is much smaller than the isotropic gamma - ray energy @xmath6 ergs .",
    "the requirements for the energy budget and time scales suggest that long grbs involve the formation of a black hole ( bh ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) or magnetars via a catastrophic stellar collapse event .",
    "the discovery of supernovae ( sne ) associated with grbs brought us the more direct evidence that grbs result from a small fraction of massive stars that undergo a catastrophic energy release event towards the end of their evolution @xcite .",
    "interestingly , some of the sne associated with grbs ( e.g. , grb 980425 , grb 060218 ) showed evidence for broad lines indicating high - velocity ejecta with inferred explosion energy of @xmath7 ergs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and those energetic sne are often called hypernovae ( hne ) .",
    "the _ central engine _ of both grbs and hne has to supply such an enormous explosion energy ( for reviews , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for the class of long grbs , the commonly discussed candidates are massive stars whose core collapses to a black hole , either directly or after a brief accretion episode , possibly in the course of merging with a companion .",
    "this _ collapsar _",
    "scenario is one of the most widely believed scenarios to explain the huge release of energy in grbs and hne @xcite . in this scenario , the collapsed iron core of a massive star forms a temporary disk around a few solar mass bh and accretes at a high rate ( @xmath8 s@xmath9 ) , which is believed to produce a powerful jet leading to a grb .",
    "the duration of the burst in this scenario can be related to the fall - back time of matter to form a disk or the accretion time of the disk .",
    "possibly , hne that are brighten by nickel could also be explained by a disk wind , which is subrelativistic with a speed comparable to the escape velocity of the inner disk @xcite .",
    "provided a disk and bh form , the greatest uncertainty in the collapsar scenario is the mechanism for converting the disk binding energy or bh rotation energy into directed relativistic outflows . so far , two general mechanisms have been proposed : neutrino annihilation and magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) mechanisms in various kinds . in the former case , neutrino pairs",
    "are generated in the hot disk and impact one another with the largest angles along the rotational axis and deposit some fraction of the accretion energy @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the efficiency of energy deposition is no greater than @xmath0 1% of the total neutrino emission @xcite , so that the required neutrino energy is @xmath10 ergs in order to achieve the jet energy of @xmath11 ergs ( which should be larger than the gamma - ray radiation energy ) .",
    "one important property of this dense , hot accretion flow is that the density is so high that cooling of the flow is dominated by neutrinos .",
    "this accretion flow is called neutrino - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf ) .",
    "although neutrinos can escape the flow more easily than photons , they can also be trapped in the flow and fail to escape before being swallowed by the black hole when the accretion rate becomes very high @xcite .",
    "the other possible mechanism is a mhd - driven explosion , where two options exist for the energy source : the binding energy of the accretion disk @xcite and the rotational energy of the bh through the blandford & znajek mechanism @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "the magnetic fields are amplified up to @xmath12 g by rotation via some disk instabilities , leading to a strong outflow . in the latter case , the bh and accretion disk",
    "are connected with magnetic field lines and the rotational energy of the bh is extracted via these magnetic field lines . in some versions of the mhd scenario , the extracted energy propagates as the poynting flux and is probably converted into a matter - dominated form at later stages , so that the efficiency of energy deposition is expected to be higher than that of the neutrino - annihilation mechanism .",
    "although the various possibilities including the fast rotating magnetar scenario @xcite as well as the collapsar scenario have been proposed , there has been no direct evidence for the central engine of grbs . in this paper",
    ", we consider gravitational waves ( gws ) as a probe of the jet - producing mechanism of grbs ( see @xcite for gws from jet itself ) .",
    "the difficulty in probing the central engine comes from the fact that most observed properties of grbs come from electromagnetic signals produced in regions far away from the central engine . on the other hand , gws and neutrinos",
    "can reach us without losing information of physical conditions near the central engine .",
    "especially , we focus on the gw emission generated by anisotropic neutrino emission , and estimate its amplitude which were investigated in the context of massive - star collapse @xcite ( see also , @xcite ) . the amplitude of this gw emission is governed by the radiated neutrino energy that has to be large enough for the neutrino - annihilation mechanism to work as the central engine of grb jets . as a result",
    ", we can show that neutrino - induced gws are detectable for @xmath01 mpc events by lisa and @xmath0 100 mpc by decigo , if the central engine is powered by neutrinos .",
    "the coincident neutrino signals can also be detected by using the super - kamiokande detector or recently proposed mton neutrino detectors such as hyper - kamiokande .",
    "possible successful detections combined with later electromagnetic observations can give us important clues to the central engine of long grbs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "ii , we describe the formulation used in this work .",
    "the necessary expressions of the gw amplitude is presented . in  iii ,",
    "we give spectra of gws from ndaf and apply the derived formula to a burst or multiple bursts representing grbs .",
    "we also discuss detectability of gws and whether we can identify a gw event as the formation of ndaf making a grb and/or hn . in ",
    "iv , the gravitational wave background is also discussed .",
    "here we consider the gravitational wave emission from anisotropic neutrino radiation , which is proposed by epstein @xcite . following the formulation developed by previous works @xcite",

    "the observer resides at a distant point on the @xmath14-axis .",
    "the viewing angle is denoted by @xmath15 , which is the angle between @xmath14 and @xmath16 axis .",
    "the @xmath16-axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the source . ]",
    "first , we introduce the two coordinate frames shown in figure [ fig : coordinate ] : the source coordinate frame @xmath17 and the observer coordinate frame @xmath13 . in these coordinate frames ,",
    "the @xmath16-axis is chosen as the symmetry axis of source , while @xmath14-axis is set to a line - of - sight direction .",
    "furthermore , the origin of these two coordinate frames are set to the center of a grb engine .",
    "thus , the viewing angle denoted by @xmath15 is given by the angle between the @xmath14-axis and the @xmath16-axis .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the @xmath14-axis lies in @xmath18-plane . in this case , the two polarization states of gws satisfying the transverse - traceless conditions become @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the observer coordinate . the geometrical setup shown in figure [ fig : coordinate ] yields the following relationship between the two polar coordinate frames @xmath21 and @xmath22 : @xmath23 with these coordinates",

    ", we estimate the amplitude of gravitational waves . for practical evaluations ,",
    "we need to know @xmath46 which should be determined by the nature of the central engine or produced jets . in the following subsections ,",
    "we regard the shape of ndaf as a geometrically thin disk or an oblate spheroid , by which we obtain the angular dependence of @xmath46 explicitly .",
    "we first consider a geometrically infinitely thin disk as a simple but useful case in order to model ndaf . in this case , the angular dependence of the neutrino emission is written as @xmath47 if we assume that the emission of neutrinos is isotropic at the disk surface .",
    "we can write the neutrino luminosity per solid angle as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the _ total _ neutrino luminosity .    at first , we consider the case of an observer located in the equatorial plane for simplicity , which means @xmath45 . in this case eq.([h+ ] ) is written as @xmath50 it is worthwhile to note that the anisotropy parameter @xmath51 defined by mller and janka @xcite ( see eq.(29 ) in their paper ) is constant and equal to @xmath52 in this case .",
    "since the duration of neutrino emission is finite , the gw amplitude converges to a non - vanishing value ) .",
    "largely - aspherical mass ejection and magnetic fields can lead to a similar gw memory @xcite .",
    "the detectability of such gw bursts with memory was discussed in @xcite . ] , which we denote as @xmath53 . with characteristic values , we can write @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the total energy emitted by neutrinos . in this work ,",
    "we employ @xmath56 ergs for calculations of the gw amplitude .",
    "this is because the required energy for a grb jet is @xmath57 ergs ergs .",
    "but note that only the fraction of the jet energy is converted into the radiation energy .",
    "for example , in the internal shock model , a fraction of the jet kinetic energy @xmath58 can be converted into the internal energy , and a fraction of the internal energy is used for acceleration of nonthermal electrons ( and amplification of the magnetic field ) .",
    "such large jet energy will also be required in some more specific scenarios .",
    "for instance , the hypothesis that grbs are the sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays is typically require @xmath59 ergs . ] and the efficiency of energy conversion is expected to be @xmath60% for the neutrino - annihilation mechanism @xcite .",
    "in addition , the energy released by matter at innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) is about 40% of its rest - mass energy for an extremely rotating kerr bh .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath61 ergs for accretion of @xmath62 .",
    "this value is also consistent with the observational evidence of grb - hne association because the explosion energy of hne is @xmath63 times larger ( @xmath64 ergs ) than that of ordinary core - collapse sne , which emit @xmath65 ergs by neutrinos .",
    "_ if _ the explosion mechanism of hne is similar to that of ordinary sne , in which the explosion energy is provided by absorption and scattering of neutrinos , the total energy emitted by neutrinos must be larger than that of ordinary sne , and we may expect @xmath66 ergs .",
    "it is useful to see dependence of the gw amplitude on the viewing angle , @xmath15 . in the thin disk model , eq.([eq : h+ ] ) can be integrated analytically , and we have @xmath67 it is obvious that the gw amplitude is the largest when the observer is located in the equatorial plane , whereas the gw vanishes when the observer is located at the pole .",
    "this implies important implication , i.e. , anti - correlation between gw signals and prompt gamma - ray photons .",
    "prompt photons themselves are highly beamed ( @xmath68 ) since they are emitted from ultrarelativistic jets moving with @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , it may not be easy to detect prompt photons when we can expect the strong gw emission .",

    ", coincident neutrinos can also be detected .",
    "especially , if we have mton detectors , we should detect coincident neutrinos if the gw emission is caused by neutrinos , and possible detections of scattering events ( rather than capturing events shown in the figure ) become useful for positioning ( see @xcite for the discussion of simultaneous observation of neutrino and gw in the case of core - collapse sne ) .",
    "see text for detail . ]    later ( follow - up ) observations of photons seem to be crucially important to determine the distance to the source , as has been already mentioned .",
    "first , observations in the optical and radio bands may lead to discovering a hn ( e.g. , see @xcite ) associated with the formation of ndaf making jets .",
    "if grb jets are successful and make prompt emission , possible detections of the prompt photons would be helpful for this purpose .",
    "in addition , it may also be possible to detect afterglow emission ( which can be expected not only for successful grbs , but also failed grbs @xcite ) . whether the outflow is well collimated or not , it should be decelerated by colliding with the interstellar medium . when prompt emission is not observed , afterglows are called _ orphan _ afterglows . in this case",
    ", the afterglow is also dim in the early phase before the jet break , during which it may not be so easy to detect its emission .",
    "however , the expected flux after the time when @xmath159 does not depend on whether afterglows are orphan or not @xcite . following the external shock scenario @xcite , we can roughly estimate the peak flux after the peak time @xmath160{(\\xi/\\theta_{j,-1})}^{2 } \\theta_{j,-1}^{8/3 } { ( e_{\\rm ej , 53}^{\\rm iso})}^{1/3 } n^{-1/3}$ ] , as @xmath161 for @xmath162 ergs , @xmath148 and @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the fraction of nonthermal electron energy , @xmath165 is the kinetic energy of the ejecta , and @xmath166 is the density of interstellar medium @xcite , respectively .",
    "although actual detectabilities depend on the detail of the afterglow spectra , this afterglow emission could be detected by groundbased optical telescopes and x - ray satellites such as _ swift _ , future maxi and exist .",
    "since the spectra and light curves depend on @xmath144 and @xmath15 , their detection could potentially give us some information about relevant parameters such as @xmath144 and @xmath15 , leading to a crude estimate of the asphericity parameter @xmath73 under our ndaf scenario .",
    "those later observations ( i.e. , detecting an associated hn component , prompt and afterglow emissions ) , combined with gw and neutrino observations , may help us to reveal the central engine of grbs and hne .",
    "we are now in a position to discuss the contribution of gws from ndaf of grbs to the background gw radiation . according to phinney @xcite , the sum of the energy densities radiated by a large number of independent grbs at each redshift",
    "is given by the density parameter @xmath167 as @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the cosmic critical density , @xmath170 is the grb rate per comoving volume , and @xmath171 .",

    ", we employ the following grb rate history ( grb3 model in refs .",
    "@xcite ) in units of yr@xmath9 gpc@xmath178 , @xmath179 where @xmath180 . note that the dependence on the overall grb rate history is so small that it is enough to use the above history for our purpose of demonstration .    in figure",
    "[ fig : gwb ] , the calculated @xmath181 is plotted together with the sensitivity curves of future detectors .",
    "we assume that all grbs have @xmath121 sec for simplicity .",
    "the red solid and green dashed lines are obtained for a grb rate of @xmath182 which is expected for high - luminosity grbs , while the blue dotted line is with one for @xmath183 which may be expected for low - luminosity grbs .",
    "the red solid line is obtained with the single - burst spectrum ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum_single ] ) ) , and the green dashed line is for the multiple - burst spectrum ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum_multi ] ) ) so that these lines differ above 1 hz . the blue dotted line is for the multiple burst spectrum .",
    "the enhancement of the gw background due to inclusion of time variation does not change the detectability by space - based interferometers since the most sensitive frequency is about 0.1 hz .",
    "although we have used the inferred rates for successful grbs , we may expect a larger contribution to the gw background if there is large population of failed grbs . at present",
    "it is difficult to predict the rate of such choked jets , but we might expect that the rate of failed grb is typically smaller than the sn ibc rate . then , the possible contribution to the gw background is at most @xmath184 at @xmath185 hz ( see @xcite for a discussion of the neutrino background from grbs and hne ) .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the amplitudes and spectra of gws from gamma - ray bursts , which are expected in the neutrino - annihilation mechanism above an ndaf disk in the collapsar scenario .",
    "we show that gws can be detected by lisa and decigo / bbo if the source distance is @xmath186  a few mpc .",
    "the expected rates of high- and low - luminosity grbs occurring at @xmath187  mpc , which correspond to the rates of bursts that can be observed by @xmath188  mton neutrino detectors @xcite , are @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "hence , detections of gw signals are possible only when grbs fortunately occur in the nearby universe .",
    "nevertheless , the possible gw signals are very important in the sense that they can probe the mechanism of the grb central engine . obtained gw spectra",
    "are _ flat _ at low frequencies , which is the characteristic feature of the gw memory effect . in order to detect gws with lisa or decigo / bbo ,",
    "sufficiently large values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath51 and large values of the released burst energy are typically required . since the mhd mechanism may typically lead to a smaller burst energy compared to the neutrino - annihilation mechanism ( where @xmath10 ergs is needed ) , detections of flat gw spectra at low frequencies from extragalactic grbs",
    "would allow us to infer that the central engine is governed by the neutrino - annihilation mechanism above an ndaf disk .",
    "we show that coincident neutrinos should be detected if we have mton detectors as long as gws arise from the neutrino emission , which should also give us important clues about the central engine ( e.g. , estimate of @xmath152 allows us to make a consistency check for the burst energy triggering the gw emission ) .    in order to identify the source emitting gws",
    ", later electromagnetic observations will be crucial .",
    "we may see prompt emission , afterglow emission and supernova emission .",
    "although the former is significantly diminished when the viewing angle is very large , we may be able to detect it for very nearby bursts .",
    "afterglow emission is also detectable even if we have orphan afterglows .",
    "successful observations of gws , neutrinos and photons will allow us to diagnose the central engine of grbs and to obtain some clues on the jet production mechanism .",
    "in addition , we can expect that hne are associated with grbs ( but it may not be necessarily the case ) .",
    "detections of hne in the optical and/or radio band will give us profound information about the explosion mechanism of hne .",
    "strong gw and neutrino emission can be expected since the neutrino - annihilation mechanism requires that the radiated neutrino energy is very large ( @xmath191  ergs ) . on the other hand",
    ", it would be more difficult to expect detectable gw signals from the mhd mechanism . hence",
    ", if we have very nearby grbs , non - detections of both gws and neutrinos might suggest the mhd mechanism rather than neutrino - annihilation which seems to have some caveats ( e.g. , the very strong dependence on the disk temperature and inefficiency in production of fireballs ) .",
    "whether signals are detected or not , simultaneous observations by gws and neutrinos will be important to probe the central engine of grbs and hne , even though the burst rate is not so large .    in this work ,",
    "we have used a thin disk or an oblate spheroid model to mimic ndaf .",
    "such a simplified treatment is sufficient for our purpose , and the characteristic feature in the low - frequency range will not be altered even if we employ elaborate numerical simulations .",
    "but , although sufficiently realistic calculations have not been done so far , further studies and developments may allow to evaluate both the neutrino flux and the gw amplitude more quantitatively .",
    "also , the effect of neutrino oscillation , which is neglected in this work , should be included for more quantitative predictions .",
    "in addition , we have employed the fiducial energy emitted by neutrinos as @xmath75 ergs , which is also unknown .",
    "the assumptions employed for this value are that the energy of a grb jet is @xmath192 ergs and the efficiency of energy conversion from neutrinos to a jet is 1% for the neutrino - annihilation mechanism . since grbs have a variety of energetics , @xmath141 might be significantly larger or smaller than this value .",
    "detections of gws and neutrinos are useful since the signal - to - noise ratios of gw show a linear increase with @xmath141 .",
    "in addition , we might have information about the efficiency of energy conversion , which is theoretically important , through obtaining the jet energy from electromagnetic observations .",
    "although we have mainly considered production of grb jets with a duration of @xmath193 s , required for explaining prompt emission , there are additional possibilities of the gw emission .",
    "recent observations by _ swift _ have shown that many grbs have flares in the afterglow phase , which suggest that the central engine is active for a longer time than the duration of the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "flares are also likely to be energetic , and the radiation energy of some flares is even comparable to that of the prompt emission .",
    "possibly , they may be produced by slower and less collimated jets , and their geometrically corrected energy may also be comparable to that of the prompt emission .",
    "then , we could also expect gw emission even in the early afterglow phase .",
