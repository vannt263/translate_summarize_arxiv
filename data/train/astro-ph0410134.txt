    "since the discovery of oh megamaser emission in arp220 @xcite , the detection of @xmath195 oh megamaser have been reported @xcite .",
    "these single dish studies show that the shapes of the oh spectral lines are often complex , and cover velocities in the range 10kms@xmath2  up to a few 1000 kms@xmath2 in each source .",
    "subsequent vlbi investigations of a few nearby oh megamaser galaxies , such as iiizw35 and mrk231 , have demonstrated that the bulk of the oh maser emission arises in circumnuclear disks or tori @xcite . however , there are also indications that a single disk component can not account for _ all _ maser emission , e.g.  in mrk273 ; @xcite .",
    "early single dish studies suggested the presence of blueshifted wings in several oh megamaser spectra @xcite . these have been interpreted as outflows , which possibly could provide an explanation for the emission that does not fit comfortably within a disk model .",
    "the existence of outflows as well as inflows is not surprising , given that oh megamaser galaxies are exclusively associated with ( ultra)luminous infra - red galaxies ( [ u]lirgs ) . ( u)lirgs probably represent short periods of nuclear starburst activity triggered by merger events .",
    "such mergers will rapidly transport gas to the central regions , causing gas to fall inwards towards the nuclei .",
    "the combined effects of supernova explosions and stellar winds generated in this nuclear starburst can entrain the interstellar medium in outflows with velocities of @xmath3 kms@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that oh maser emission occurs in both of the merging nuclei , as has been seen in arp220 @xcite . with a slight offset in systemic velocity between the two merging nuclei , the combined spectrum observed with a single dish telescope",
    "would be relatively broad .",
    "however , for the very broadest oh megamaser lines ( exceeding 1000 kms@xmath2 ) , it is hard to interpret the lines either as originating from a single disk component or from a pair of nuclei .",
    "a combination of orbital mechanics , possible disk rotation , molecular inflow and outflow , and the velocity separation of the two main lines at 1667  mhz and 1665  mhz is likely to make up the velocity range in such oh megamaser spectra .",
    "earlier global vlbi experiments have reported the presence of 100 kms@xmath2 broad oh maser lines on parsec scales @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will concentrate on investigating the cause of oh megamaser lines with widths exceeding 1000 kms@xmath2 .",
    "we report on vlba observations of two oh megamaser galaxies , iras14070 + 0525 and iras12032 + 1707 , that have full width zero intensity velocities of @xmath4kms@xmath2 .",
    "these objects are additionally interesting because of their high redshifts ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , their high oh luminosities of @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively make the term gigamaser suitable , and as such these galaxies are two of the most powerful oh megamaser galaxies known .",
    "the main aim of the current observations was to determine whether the broad lines are associated with inflows , outflows , rotating structures or violent kinematics .",
    "this paper also presents arecibo absorption data for one of the sources , iras12032 + 1707 .",
    "iras12032 + 1707 was observed in phase - referencing mode with the vlba for 12 hours on 2002 july 8 .",
    "the redshift of iras12032 + 1707 ( @xmath5 ) shifted the 1667.359mhz line to 1369mhz , that was used as the center of the observing band . to cover the complete oh emission velocity range of iras12032 + 1707 ( @xmath12000 kms@xmath2 ) , a bandwidth of 16mhz per left and right hand polarization was used .",
    "all telescopes were available at the time of the observations , and only minor periods of time required flagging due to radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "iras14070 + 0525 was observed with a similar setup in june 9 , 2002 .",
    "the 16mhz if pair was centered on the redshifted ( @xmath6 ) frequency of 1318mhz .",
    "due to rfi the kp telescope showed extreme and highly variable system temperatures , and to a large extent data had to be flagged for this telescope .",
    "furthermore , the la antenna was broken and so did not participate in these observations . at the observing frequency of 1318mhz , several rfi spikes could be seen in the autocorrelation spectra . since the frequencies at which these spikes occurred differed between the sites , they did not affect the cross correlation spectra for the most part .",
    "badly affected time ranges were removed on ` by baseline ' basis .",
    "the data were correlated at the vlba correlator in socorro using the maximum 512 channels available .",
    "data reduction was performed within aips .",
    "both datasets were amplitude calibrated using the system temperature measurements , and fringe - fitting was performed on the phase - reference sources since the low signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for the weak maser features prevented self - calibration on any individual maser peak . for iras12032 + 1707",
    "the data were imaged using robust weighting , with a beam size @xmath9 mas ( @xmath10 pc)=@xmath11 kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in a flat universe , the linear scale is 3.482 pcmas@xmath2 at @xmath14=0.217 and 4.046 pcmas@xmath2 at @xmath14=0.265 . ] .",
    "iras14070 + 0525 was imaged with natural weighting with a beam size of @xmath15 mas ( @xmath16 pc)@xmath17 .",
    "before the cubes were analyzed , data were smoothed in frequency in order to further improve the snr , to a channel increment of 34 kms@xmath2  for iras12032 + 1707 ( 1@xmath18 noise level per channel of 0.6 mjy beam@xmath2 ) and 82 kms@xmath2  for iras14070 + 0525 1@xmath18 noise level per channel of 0.6 mjy beam@xmath2 ) .      to compare the velocity distribution of the oh emission with any possible absorption , data was taken at arecibo on june 26 , 2003 .",
    "observations were performed in position - switched mode with the l - wide receiver , covering a bandwidth of 12.5  mhz with 1024 spectral channels .",
    "hanning smoothing was applied , and left and right polarizations were averaged to optimize the sensitivity .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 36 minutes , yielding an rms noise of 0.48 mjy .",
    "in order to determine the physical origin of the broad lines , we are interested in both the spatial distribution and the velocity fields of our sources . we present results of the data analysis for each source below .",
    "figure [ ir12_average ] shows the spatial extent of oh megamaser emission in iras12032 + 1707 , averaged over all channels of signal above the @xmath19 level .",
    "in addition to a central structure confined within a region of 25@xmath2025 mas ( @xmath2187 pc ) , this map shows an extension of the source to the north - east .",
    "the maser line was to weak to perform self - calibration , and on larger scales than that shown in fig .",
    "[ ir12_average ] we can see some weaker features in the map that are likely to be the results of calibration errors .",
    "the north - east extension is only seen at contours close to 3@xmath18 , and it is uncertain whether this feature is significant .",
    "mapping the line emission at a few different resolutions , and using different weighting schemes show ambiguous results for this feature while the central component remains the same .",
    "therefore we will not consider the north - east extension to be significant in the discussion in this paper .",
    "we conclude that the oh maser emission is centered at ra 12:05:47.7225 and dec 16:51:08.266 ( j2000 ) .",
    "this coincides , within the @xmath22 vla positional errorbars , with the position given for the continuum in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , @xcite ) .",
    "near - infrared ( nir ) and optical imaging have identified two nuclei in this source @xcite with a projected separation of 3.8(13.2 kpc ) in an approximately north - south direction . from the nir and the optical positions",
    ", we can thus associate all oh megamaser emission with the northern nucleus .    in fig .",
    "[ ir12_totspec ] we plot the resulting spectrum including the emission in every pixel with emission above @xmath19 .",
    "the velocity scale is referenced to the 1667  mhz line , and the optical systemic velocity is 65055 kms@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this can be compared to the single dish spectrum published by @xcite . within the noise ,",
    "we recover all of the single dish flux density in our vlba data .",
    "there is a weak , redshifted wing at velocities above 65700 kms@xmath2 in the spectrum by @xcite that is not clearly identified in our data .",
    "the 3@xmath18 rms noise level in our spectrum is at 1.8 mjy / beam , which is at the same level as the emission in the arecibo spectrum .",
    "thus , we can not determine whether the red wing is resolved out in the vlba data , or whether it is hard to see because it is not discernible from the noise .",
    "since the snr is limited in our data , we perform additional spectral averaging to extract velocity information from the cube .",
    "at least five peaks in our total intensity spectrum can readily be identified in the single dish spectrum . by averaging a range of six channels around each peak",
    ", we constructed five contour maps .",
    "2-dimensional gaussian fitting was then performed on each map to derive their centroid position .",
    "the positional error bars were calculated using the expression @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angular resolution in each direction , and the snr is the snr in each map .",
    "the result of the fitting is displayed in fig .",
    "[ ir12_radecpos ] .",
    "clearly there exists an ordered velocity field , with a major gradient seen in an approximately north - south direction .",
    "the broad velocity extent of the oh emission implies the possibility of blending between hyperfine transitions at 1667 and 1665  mhz . in the heliocentric velocity frame these hyperfine lines are expected to have a velocity separation of 428kms@xmath2 .",
    "it could therefore be possible that the most blueshifted peak at 64487 kms@xmath2  has its 1665  mhz counterpart in the peak at 64908 kms@xmath2 .",
    "we note however that for the only cases in which the 1665  mhz emission has been detected in an vlbi experiment @xcite , the 1665  mhz emission closely follows the 1667  mhz distribution .",
    "since the two peaks in our experiment have very different spatial positions , we will assume that the emission line is dominated by 1667  mhz emission .",
    "this is known to be the case for all oh megamasers with well separated hyperfine transitions .      from the nvss iras12032 + 1707 is expected to have a correlated 1.4 ghz continuum flux density of 29 mjy @xcite . due to the broad line width of the oh maser emission , there was only a limited part of the observed band that contained line free channels .",
    "20% of the total passband was selected and averaged in an attempt to search for the continuum emission .",
    "using the same imaging parameters as described for the oh emission ( sect .",
    "[ vlbaobs ] ) no significant continuum emission was detected at a @xmath19 level of 0.3 mjy / beam .",
    "given the beam size this implies that the continuum becomes resolved on scales less than around 75 mas ( 260 pc ) .",
    "we note that using natural weighting , in combination with a heavy tapering of the data , yields a tentative detection of @xmath11 mjy coincident with the location of oh emission .",
    "however , given that no self - calibration can be performed , the significance of this continuum emission is questionable . in future ,",
    "more sensitive observations are required to address this issue .      the arecibo absorption spectrum is shown in fig .   [ arecibospectrum ] .",
    "the absorption can be fitted by two gaussian components with centroid velocities of 65119 and 65496 kms@xmath2   and full width half maxima of 186 and 166 kms@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "overlaid on the spectrum is the vlba oh maser spectrum ( scaled down by a factor of 5 in amplitude ) , allowing a comparison between the and oh velocities .",
    "we conclude that the bulk of the absorption coincides in velocity with the reddest velocity components of the vlba oh maser emission .",
    "the implied column densities can be estimated to @xmath25 @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the spin temperature and @xmath28 is the filling factor .",
    "figure [ ir14_totspec ] shows the total integrated oh flux density that is recovered in our vlba observations . as with iras12032 + 1707",
    ", all velocity scales are referenced to the 1667  mhz line .",
    "the systemic velocity of 79445@xmath29 kms@xmath2  @xcite is slightly offset from the velocity components detected in our vlba data .",
    "we can define two peaks in the spectrum , with corresponding velocity centroids of @xmath179900 kms@xmath2 and 80250 kms@xmath2 .",
    "given the low spectral resolution of our vlba spectrum ( 82kms@xmath2 ) , these peaks coincide with peaks seen in the single dish spectrum at velocities of 79950kms@xmath2 and 80200kms@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , several distinct single dish peaks are missing from our vlba spectrum , and we can only account for a minor part of the flux density observed by single dish ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "for example , the single dish spectrum displays a prominent feature at around 79000kms@xmath2  that we do not detect .",
    "this implies that a large part of the emission is relatively diffuse .",
    "we note that these observations did not include la and only partly the kp telescopes , leading to a substantial loss of the short baselines required to detect oh at angular scales @xmath31 mas ( @xmath32 pc ) .",
    "figure [ ir14_average ] displays the spatial extent of all emission detected , which is contained within a region of around 10@xmath2010 mas ( @xmath33 pc ) .",
    "the emission is centered at ra 14 09 31.2446 and dec 05 11 31.507 ( j2000 ) , which coincides with the optical and nir nuclear positions reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured a 1.4  ghz continuum flux density of 5 mjy .",
    "no continuum emission was detected for iras14070 + 0525 at a 3@xmath18 level of 0.45 mjy / beam .",
    "the continuum in iras12032 + 1707 is only tentatively detected at the shortest u , v distances ( sect .",
    "[ cont ] ) . in part",
    ", this result could be due to calibration errors , but it also indicates that the majority of continuum emission is found on scales larger than 260 pc ( sect .  [ cont ] ) .",
    "that implies an upper limit of the brightness temperature to be around 3@xmath34 k. such a brightness temperature and spatial distribution would be consistent with a starburst origin similar to that seen in arp220 @xcite and iiizw35 @xcite .",
    "many ulirgs fall on the radio - fir correlation for starbursts @xcite .",
    "this correlation can be understood by assuming that the radio emission is arising from starburst induced supernova remnants and from hii regions . following the definitions from @xcite , the correlation is quantified by a logarithmic ratio between the far - infrared flux density ( @xmath35 ) and the 1.4 ghz radio flux density ( @xmath36 ) :    @xmath37    where @xmath35 is defined by    @xmath38    for",
    "the infrared selected galaxies in the @xmath39 2 jy sample , the mean value of @xmath40 is @xmath41 @xcite . given the fir luminosity and radio flux density of iras12032 + 1707 , we estimate @xmath42 .",
    "this value appears low compared with the mean of 2.35 and could imply the presence of an agn .",
    "this appears contradictory to the non - detection of a compact radio agn core . however , radio - excess objects in the @xmath39 2 jy sample are defined as those objects having a radio luminosity that is greater than 5 times larger that predicted by the radio - fir correlation .",
    "equivalently , this means objects for which q@xmath431.64 .",
    "furthermore , iras12032 + 1707 has a very large infrared luminosity ( log@xmath44 ) , placing the galaxy at the high tail of the ulirg luminosity distribution @xcite . for the most luminous sources in the @xmath39 2 jy sample , scattering from the radio - fir correlation is significantly larger than for the weaker sources with weaker fir flux densities .",
    "therefore , the relatively low @xmath40-value for our source is not sufficient to indicate the presence of an agn component .",
    "other evidence that iras12032 + 1707 is starburst - powered comes from its relatively cool ir color , @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it is only for warm colors ( @xmath46 ) that an agn component is required to explain the resulting dust temperatures .",
    "the zero - intensity line width of the oh maser emission in iras12032 + 1707 is around 2000 kms@xmath2 , which makes this source the host of one of the broadest oh megamaser lines .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , this velocity range could be due to a combination of effects such as disk rotation and gas flows .",
    "due to the limited snr in our data , it is difficult to determine unambiguously the cause of the masers in iras12032 + 1707 .",
    "below we discuss a few possible scenarios that could agree with our observations .",
    "it has been suggested that very broad oh megamaser lines might be a combination of maser emission occurring in _ both _ of the merging nuclei , as is the case for the oh megamaser prototype arp220 @xcite .",
    "we can rule out that maser emission in iras12032 + 1707 is the combined emission from the southern and northern nuclei , since it is clear that all maser emission occurs only in the northern nucleus ( sect .",
    "[ ohspatial ] ) .",
    "we can not however exclude the possibility that the northern nucleus itself is made up of two more closely interacting galaxies .",
    "in arp220 the nuclei have a projected separation of only 300 pc , which would correspond to an angular resolution of 86 mas at the distance of iras12032 + 1707 , much smaller than the near - infrared seeing limit of 0.73reported for the nir image @xcite .",
    "this issue requires further investigation by future higher resolution infrared and optical imaging , combined with vlbi maser data .    in the oh megamaser source mrk231  absorption",
    "has been seen against a faint continuum disk @xcite , and the velocity field displays a gradient in the same direction as the oh megamaser disk @xcite . in particular , the  absorption velocities encompass those of the oh lines . assuming that   absorption in iras12032 + 1707 has the same close correlation to oh as the  in mrk231 , then the fact that  only partly covers the oh velocities implies that the absorption is seen against only one of the disks .      a clue to the nature of the oh maser emission must be given by the plot of the centroid position of the different velocity components .",
    "clearly , there is a structured velocity field , with a bulk gradient in the north - south direction .",
    "if we assume that all maser emission belongs to a single disk - like structure , with a major axis going through the three most redshifted points at a position angle ( pa ) of 11@xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ ir12_radecpos ] ) , we can plot the data as velocity versus distance along this axis ( fig .  [ velpos ] ) .",
    "a least squares fit to the data points yields a gradient of 55 kms@xmath48pc@xmath49 over 17 pc . in total",
    ", this would mean an enclosed mass of 2.2@xmath50sin@xmath51 within a radius of 8.5 pc .",
    "such a velocity gradient is surprisingly high given the gradients observed in other oh megamaser galaxies .",
    "for instance , for both iiizw35 and mrk231 , the velocity gradient is close to 1.5 kms@xmath49pc@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of multiple disks suggested in sect .",
    "[ multipledisks ] , a scenario with a single disk for iras12032 + 1707 makes it difficult to understand why the absorption covers only part of the oh velocity range ( assuming that the  and oh are parts of the same neutral gas structure ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation of fig .",
    "[ ir12_radecpos ] could include two different gas components .",
    "a couple of facts support the possibility of two physically different oh maser components in iras12032 + 1707 .",
    "firstly , single - dish variability studies show that the two strongest and most blueshifted peaks have a variable flux density while the redshifted emission displays no significant variability ( j.  darling , priv .",
    "secondly , the   absorption velocities cover only the redshifted oh components ( sect",
    ".   [ hires ] ) .",
    "if the  has a common origin with the redshifted oh gas , the blueshifted and redshifted masers are likely to be physically different gas structures .    studying the relative location of maser components in fig .",
    "[ ir12_radecpos ] , we suggest that the two most blueshifted masers ( which also are the brightest ones ) could represent the tangent points of a circumnuclear disk . with an inclined disk ( or torus ) , the tangent points will have the longest paths of velocity coherent gas , resulting in regions of very strong maser emission .",
    "this effect has been observed in iiizw35 @xcite .",
    "the rotational velocity of such a torus or disk structure in iras12032 + 1707 would be 118 sin@xmath52 kms@xmath2 at a radius of 3 pc , yielding a modest enclosed mass of 5@xmath34sin@xmath53 .",
    "if the two blueshifted masers define the major axis of a disk component , the redshifted masers are directed more or less perpendicular to the disk ( fig .",
    "[ ir12_radecpos ] ) . by studying the optical and nir images of iras12032 + 1707",
    "@xcite it can be seen that the southern optical nucleus is located slightly west of south , with respect to the northern nucleus .",
    "tentatively , the redshifted masers could arise in gas that has been disturbed by tidal interactions between the merging nuclei . with the caveat of over - interpreting our low snr data , it is tantalizing to note that there is a weak hint in fig .",
    "[ velpos ] of gas closer to the nucleus moving with higher velocity with respect to the nucleus , than does the gas further away .    in this scenario",
    "we suggest that the  and the redshifted oh originate in the same gas component .",
    "any gas associated with the   absorption must thus necessarily be in front of the background continuum .",
    "assuming the blue masers define a disk , it is plausible that the  is seen in absorption against a weak radio continuum emitted by this disk . given a limited field of view in the vlba observations , in addition to an only tentative detection of the radio continuum , it is justified to question whether the radio continuum in fact coincides at all with the maser emission .",
    "we note that vla a - array observations have showed that all radio continuum emission originates in the northern optical nucleus ( j.  darling , priv .",
    "comm . ) , and the oh maser emission is located in the same region .",
    "since  absorption requires the presence of a background continuum , this is consistent with the  absorption and oh masers occurring in the same region , at least on scales of a few kpc ( corresponding to the vla a - array resolution ) .",
    "the optical systemic velocity of the nucleus is 65055 kms@xmath2 with an 1@xmath18 error of @xmath29kms@xmath2@xcite . comparing the optical systemic velocity with",
    "the oh and  velocities is hard since the optical redshift is measured for the whole iras12032 + 1707 system , and thus does not separate the optical nuclei .",
    "in addition , the velocity is determined from optical emission lines that are often broad and might not properly reflect the systemic velocity since the emission lines may be associated with gas in motion with respect to the nucleus . nevertheless , within a 3@xmath18 limit",
    "the systemic velocity is consistent with redshifted maser components _ falling in _ towards the nucleus .",
    "@xcite reports on optical emission lines in iras12032 + 1707 , that are broad compared to the typical ulirg , consistent with the presence of an infalling gas component .",
    "neutral gas flows have been observed previously in other galaxies .",
    "for instance , vla observations of the 1667 , 1665 and 1612 mhz",
    "oh lines in the galactic center have revealed gas streaming inwards from the cnd ( the circumnuclear disk ) toward sgra * @xcite .",
    "the streamer can be seen over a velocity range of @xmath1100 kms@xmath2 .",
    "furthermore ,   studies have extensively been used to trace merger dynamics , and one example is the detailed studies of  emission in ` the antennae ' . @xcite have mapped high  column densities exceeding @xmath54 @xmath26 in the region of the merging disks in this source .",
    "it is not unlikely that similar column densities could be probed by  absorption in a merger like iras12032 + 1707 .",
    "a major difficulty with interpreting the oh megamaser emission in iras14070 + 0525 is that we only detect a fraction of the total single dish emission .",
    "as already mentioned , a reason why so much emission is resolved out may be the lack of short baselines in our vlba observations .",
    "the offset between the two detected peaks is not significant .",
    "optical and nir imaging can not distinguish more than one nucleus in iras14070 + 0525 , and this source is interpreted as a merger where the nuclei have more or less coalesced @xcite .",
    "two nuclei could thus be located close to each other , and violent gas kinematics adding to the line width would be anticipated .",
    "more sensitive vlbi observations probing the emission on all spatial scales will be needed to gain a better understanding of the oh megamaser emission in this galaxy .",
    "iras14070 + 0525 is classified optically as a seyfert 2 galaxy @xcite . however , the color given by @xmath55 flux density ratio is only 0.13 , and does not indicate the presence of an agn .",
    "contrary to iras12032 + 1707 , iras14070 + 0525 falls on the radio - ir correlation with @xmath56 @xcite , and no compact radio emission associated with an agn was detected .",
    "hence , the radio emission is diffuse and consistent with a starburst . given the low 1.4 ghz flux density of 5mjy @xcite , a slightly resolved starburst would be expected to fall below our detection limit in these observations .",
    "we have presented vlba data on the broad oh megamaser emission in two iras galaxies iras12032 + 1707 and iras14070 + 0525 . due to insufficient coverage at short uv - spacings ,",
    "only a minor part of the oh flux density was detected in the second source , iras14070 + 0525 .",
    "we find no significant evidence of an ordered velocity field in this source , but these results are inconclusive due to a very low snr .    almost all oh emission previously detected by single dish has been recovered in iras12032 + 1707 , and is found on a compact scale of @xmath0100 pc .",
    "the emission shows an ordered velocity field that could be consistent with a single disk .",
    "although this may be the simplest explanation , we prefer an alternative explanation that better ties with the  absorption data and variability studies of the maser emission . in this scenario , the two strongest and most blueshifted maser features would be the tangent points of a disk with major axis in the north - west to south - east direction .",
    "the remaining , redshifted maser features are aligned roughly perpendicular to this disk , extending to the south , i.e. , the direction in which the second optical nucleus is located . this redshifted emission could thus be associated with tidally streaming gas falling onto the northern optical nucleus .",
    "the  absorption covers the velocities of the redshifted maser emission , suggesting a common origin .",
    "we note that this scenario is speculative given the number of data points .",
    "this should be confirmed with vlbi using a number of large dishes to increase the snr .",
    "it would also be interesting to study high resolution co data of this source .",

    "<S> we also present arecibo absorption data . </S>",
    "<S> almost all oh emission previously detected by single dish observations has been recovered in iras12032 + 1707 and is found on a compact scale of @xmath0100 pc . </S>",
    "<S> the emission shows an ordered velocity field that is consistent with a single disk however , the data is also consistent with a scenario including two physically different gas components . </S>",
    "<S> we explore this possibility , in which the two strongest and most blueshifted maser features are identified as the tangent points of a circumnuclear torus . </S>",
    "<S> the redshifted maser features would be extended in a direction perpendicular to the torus , which is in the direction of the merger companion . </S>",
    "<S> thus , redshifted emission could be associated with an inflow triggered by a tidal interaction .  </S>",
    "<S> absorption covers the velocities of the redshifted maser emission , suggesting a common origin . in the second source , iras14070 + 0525 </S>",
    "<S> , a large fraction of the oh emission is resolved out with the vlba . </S>",
    "<S> we find no significant evidence of an ordered velocity field in this source , but these results are inconclusive due to a very low signal - to - noise ratio . </S>"
