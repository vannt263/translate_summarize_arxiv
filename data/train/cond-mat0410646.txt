    "many natural and man - made complex systems can be fruitfully represented and studied in terms of networks or graphs @xcite , in which the vertices stand for the elementary units that compose the system , while the edges picture the interactions or relations between pairs of units .",
    "this topological representation has found many applications in fields as diverse as the internet @xcite , the world - wide web @xcite , biological interacting networks @xcite or social systems @xcite , leading to the development of a new branch of statistical mechanics , the modern theory of complex networks @xcite .",
    "the empirical study of real complex networks , promoted by the recent accessibility to computers powerful enough to deal with very large databases , has uncovered the presence of some typical characteristics .",
    "the three most relevant of these are : ( i ) the small - world property @xcite , defined by an average shortest path length ",
    "average distance between any pair of vertices  increasing very slowly ( logarithmically or slower @xcite ) with the network size @xmath1 .",
    "( ii ) the presence of a large transitivity @xcite , which implies that two neighbors of a given vertex are also connected to each other with large probability .",
    "transitivity can be quantitatively measured by means of the clustering coefficient @xmath2 of vertex @xmath3 @xcite , defined as the ratio between the number of edges @xmath4 existing betwen the @xmath5 neighbors of @xmath3 , and its maximum possible value , i.e. @xmath6 . the average clustering coefficient , defined as @xmath7 , usually takes quite large values in real complex networks .",
    "( iii ) a scale - free behaviour for the degree distribution @xmath8 @xcite , defined as the probability that a vertex is connected to @xmath0 other vertices ( has degree @xmath0 ) , that shows a power - law behavior @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a characteristic degree exponent , usually in the range @xmath11 . a major role is especially played by the scale - free nature of many real complex networks , which implies a large connectivity heterogeneity , at the basis of the peculiar behavior shown by dynamical processes taking place on top of these networks , such as the resilience to random damage @xcite , the spreading of infectious agents @xcite , or diffusion - annihilation processes @xcite .",
    "> from a theoretical point of view , the empirical research has inspired the proposal of new network models , aimed at reproducing and explaining the properties exhibited by complex networks . in this respect , many efforts have been devoted to develop models capable to account for a scale - free degree distribution .",
    "classical network modeling was previously based on the erds - renyi random graph model @xcite , which is a static model ( i.e. defined for a fixed number of vertices @xmath1 ) yielding small - world networks with a poisson degree distribution .",
    "a change of perspective in nework modeling took place after the introduction of the preferential attachment paradigm first proposed by barabsi and albert ( ba ) @xcite .",
    "the insight behind this concept is the realization of two facts : firstly , most complex networks are the result of a growth process , in which new vertices are added in time to the system .",
    "secondly , new edges are not placed at random , but tend to connect to vertices which already have a large degree .",
    "it turns out that these two ingredients are able to reproduce scale - free degree distributions with a tunable degree exponent  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that not all sorts of preferential attachment are able to generate a power law degree distribution , but only those in which new edges attach to vertices with a probability strictly linear in their degree @xcite , and that some alternative mechanisms , such as the copying model @xcite implicitly define a linear preferential attachment dynamics .",
    "while a proper characterization and understanding of the origin of the scale - free degree distribution displayed by most real complex networks is a fundamental task , it has been recently realized that this property does not provide a suffient characterization of natural networks .",
    "in fact , these systems seem to exhibit also ubiquitous degree correlations , which translate in the fact that the degrees of the vertices at the end points of any given edge are not independent @xcite . two vertex degree correlation can be conveniently measured by means of the conditional probability @xmath12 that a vertex of degree @xmath0 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath13 . for uncorrelated networks ,",
    "in which this conditional probability is independent of @xmath0 , it can be estimated as the probability that any edge end points to a vertex of degree @xmath13 , which is simply given by @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the empirical evaluation of @xmath12 in real networks is usually a cumbersome task , restricted by finite size data yielding noisy results . for this reason ,",
    "it is more practical to analyze instead the average degree of the nearest neighbors of the vertices of degree @xmath0 , which is formally defined as  @xcite @xmath15 for uncorrelated networks , in which @xmath12 does not depend on @xmath0 , we have @xmath16 independent of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a @xmath17 function with an explicit dependence on the degree signals the presence of two vertex degree correlations in the network .",
    "when @xmath17 is an increasing function of @xmath0 , the network shows _ assortative mixing _",
    "@xcite ( vertices of large degree connected more preferably with vertices of large degree , and vice - versa ) .",
    "negative correlations ( low degree vertices connected preferably with large degree vertices ) , on the other hand , give rise to _ dissasortative mixing _ , detected by a decreasing @xmath17 function .",
    "analogously to two vertex correlations , correlations implying three vertices can be mesured by means of the probability @xmath18 that a vertex of degree @xmath0 is simultaneously connected to vertices of degree @xmath13 and @xmath19 .",
    "again , the difficulties in directly estimating this conditional probability can be overcome by analyzing the clustering coefficient .",
    "the average clustering coefficient of the vertices of degree @xmath0 ( the clustering spectrum ) , @xmath20 @xcite , can be formally computed as the probability that a vertex of degree @xmath0 is connected to vertices of degree @xmath13 and @xmath19 , and that those two vertices are at the same time joined by an edge , averaged over all the possible values of @xmath13 and @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath20 as a function of the three vertex correlations as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the probability that vertices @xmath13 and @xmath19 are connected , provided that they have a common neighbor @xmath0 . can depend on the degree @xmath0 of the common vertex ] from this expression , the average clustering coefficient can be computed as @xmath23 for uncorrelated networks , we have that @xmath24 @xcite , and @xmath25 @xcite",
    ". therefore we obtain @xmath26 that is , @xmath27 is independent of @xmath0 and equal to the average clustering coefficient @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "a functional dependence of @xmath20 on the degree can thus be attributed to the presence of a structure in the three vertex correlations . in particular , for scale - free networks it has been observed that in many instances , the clustering spectrum exhibits also a power - law behavior , @xmath29 . a value of @xmath30 close to @xmath31 has been empirically observed in several natural networks , and analytically found in some growing network models @xcite .",
    "these findings have led to propose the clustering spectrum @xmath20 as a tool to measure hierarchical organization and modularity in complex networks @xcite .",
    "the presence of correlations are thus a very relevant issue in order to understand and classify complex networks , especially in view of the important consequences that they can have on dynamical processes taking place on the topology defined by the networks @xcite . while there are quite a few empirical results for real networks ,",
    "the situation is not the same for network models , and therefore there is no consensus regarding the origin of assortative and dissasortative mixing , and its relation with the power law behavior of the clustering spectrum @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , most works devoted to analytical calculations of correlations in complex network models have been performed only for particular cases @xcite . in this respect , it is noteworthy the rate equation formalism proposed by szab _ et al . _ in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also @xcite ) to compute @xmath20 in growing network models with preferential attachment .",
    "however , and up to our knowledge , no such formalism has been developed to deal with two vertex correlations , as given by the @xmath17 function .    in this paper",
    "we revise the formalism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for computing the clustering spectrum in growing networks models with preferential attachment .",
    "reconsidering the mean field rate equation in the continuous degree approximation for the @xmath20 presented in @xcite , we are able to provide a general expression for the boundary condition of this rate equation , which was neglected in the original treatment and which can have as a matter of fact relevant effects in the final solution , as we will show below . inspired by this result we also propose a new rate equation for two vertex correlations , as measured by the @xmath17 function , and work out the correponding boundary condition .",
    "we remark that both equations are valid in general for the so - called `` citation networks '' @xcite , in which neither edge or vertex removal nor edge rewiring are allowed .",
    "the general formalism is presented in section [ sec : rate - equat - corr ] .",
    "the rate equations obtained can be easily solved for growing networks with linear preferential attachement ( lpa ) @xcite , as shown in section  [ sec : lpa ] . in particular , we are able to obtain expressions for the dependence of the correlations on the degree @xmath0 and the system size @xmath1 , for both the dissasortative and assortative regimes of the model , which are in very good agreement with numerical simulations and previous scaling arguments @xcite .",
    "lpa models generate networks with a vanishing average clustering coefficient @xmath28 . in order to asses",
    "the effects of a nonzero clustering , we study in section [ sec : gener - dorog - mend ] a growing model presenting a large final clustering coefficient @xcite , which we are able to compute with very good accuracy .",
    "the results obtained are qualitatively similar to those shown by the holme - kim model @xcite .",
    "the rate equation proposed for two vertex correlations can be easily generalized to deal with more involved situations . as an example of its flexibility , we examine in section [ sec : weight - grow - netw ] a recently proposed model for the evolution of weighted complex networks @xcite .",
    "in this case , we extend our formalism to compute a function estimating weighted two vertex correlations , in which the actual strength of the interactions between neighboring vertices is taken into account .",
    "our results allow us to discuss the scaling form of two and three vertex correlation functions , and signal the possible relations that can be established between them .",
    "let us consider the class of growing network models in which , at each time step , a new vertex with @xmath32 edges is added to the network . for the vertex introduced at time @xmath33 ,",
    "each of its emanating edges is connected to an existing vertex introduced at time @xmath34 ( @xmath35 with a connection probability @xmath36 , which is assumed to depend only on the degrees of the existing vertices at time @xmath33 , @xmath37 .",

    "it is important to notice that this model actually contains the lpa mechanism in a disguised form .",
    "indeed , the probability to choose a vertex @xmath34 is clearly proportional to the number of edges arriving to @xmath34 , i.e. to its degree @xmath174 . at time @xmath33",

    "the weighted average degree of the nearest neighbors @xmath240 , is defined as the average of @xmath244 for all the vertices with the same degree @xmath0 .",
    "we can study analytically the weighted two vertex correlations by seeking a rate equation for the quantity @xmath245 according to the rules defining the model , at each time step @xmath246 can increase its value by two mechanisms :    * if a new vertex is directly attached to @xmath34 , @xmath246 increases by an amount @xmath247 * if a new vertex is attached to a neighbour @xmath53 of @xmath34 , then @xmath246 increases by @xmath248    therefore , the rate equation fulfilled by @xmath246 is @xmath249 which , in terms of @xmath250 and @xmath246 , yields @xmath251 inserting the value of @xmath250 given by eq .",
