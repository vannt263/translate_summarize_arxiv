    "one aspect of the electronic properties of the cuprate superconductors which remains mysterious is their frequency - dependent microwave conductivity  @xcite , the measurement of which sheds light on the effect of disorder on quasiparticle properties . a common feature of many theoretical approaches to disorder ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) in d - wave superconductors ( although there have been a number of exceptions  @xcite ) is the assumption that the scattering may be modelled by _ pointlike _ impurities .",
    "recent work  @xcite found that the spectrum of quasiparticle excitations is qualitatively different when the disorder is taken to consist of _ extended _ impurities , i.e. , impurities characterized by a typical size @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermi wavelength . while the density of states @xmath2 is believed to vanish linearly at low energies for the case of poinlike impurities  @xcite , in ref .",
    "it was found that , for disorder consisting of extended impurities , @xmath2 is divergent ( @xmath3 ) at low - energies .",
    "this low - energy buildup of states arises from the hybridization of andreev bound states occurring near each such extended impurity . before proceeding ,",
    "we provide two specific experimental motivations for studying the effect of extended impurities on the electronic properties of d - wave superconductors : firstly , recent technical advances have allowed the fabrication of ultra - pure ybco which has almost no atomic disorder in the cuo@xmath4 planes  @xcite . a significant source of disorder may originate away from the cuo@xmath4 planes and can be expected to project a relatively long - wavelength potential on the cuo@xmath4 planes .",
    "secondly , there is also the possibility of deliberately creating extended defects via ion irradiation techniques  @xcite .",
    "apart from these specific possibilities , we note that although the calculation presented here strictly applies to the case of disorder satisfying @xmath0 , the physical effects may persist beyond this regime .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to further explore the consequences of extended impurities on the electronic properties of a d - wave superconductor by computing the associated contribution to the microwave conductivity . to accomplish this",
    ", we invoke a semiclassical approximation  @xcite which accesses the low - energy andreev - bound states occuring near each impurity . although the individual andreev bound state wavefunctions are localized near the impurities , they become delocalized at low energies due to tunneling corrections  @xcite , leading to a concomitant contribution to the conductivity .",
    "we find that a natural way to study such tunneling effects between andreev bound states ( and to compute their associated contribution to the conductivity ) is via a real - space renormalization group ( rsrg ) technique which is a variant of the decimation technique familiar from random spin systems  @xcite .",
    "thus , although the andreev bound states near individual impurities are strongly coupled to each other , the rsrg reveals effective andreev bound states associated with _",
    "many _ impurities which are weakly coupled and which contribute strongly to the low - energy microwave response .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : bdg ] we employ a semiclassical approximation which reduces the bogoliubov - de gennes eigenproblem for a disordered d - wave superconductor to a family of one dimensional random pair potential models ( represented by a hamiltonian @xmath5 ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsrg ] we introduce the rsrg decimation procedure for computing average properties of @xmath5 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : micro ] we apply this procedure to the computation of the microwave conductivity of a d - wave superconductor and discuss our results . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] , we make some brief concluding remarks . in the appendix",
    ", we present a calculation of the average single - particle green function of @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the quasiparticles of a d - wave superconductor with extended impurities are governed by the following bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) action : @xmath6\\psi , \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the fermi energy [ i.e.  @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the fermi wavevector ] , and we have adopted units in which @xmath11 . the d - wave pair potential operator @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the pair - potential maximum .",
    "we take the disorder potential @xmath14 to arise from randomly located impurities of typical size @xmath15 and typical spacing @xmath16 , and focus on the regime @xmath17 .    to study the andreev bound states occuring near each extended impurity , we next invoke a semiclassical approximation ( valid for @xmath18 ) which has been extensively discussed elsewhere  @xcite and which exchanges the bdg hamiltonian for an effective problem residing on a classical trajectory @xmath19 solving newton s equation [ i.e.  @xmath20 .",
    "this is implemented by writing for a particular incoming momentum direction @xmath21 ( @xmath22 for @xmath23 ) the field @xmath24 as @xmath25 and expanding to leading order in derivatives . here ,",
    "the eikonal @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27 with the overdot denoting differentiation with respect to the parameter @xmath28 along a trajectory . the amplitude @xmath29 .",
    "a given realization of @xmath14 leads to a set of classical trajectories labelled by @xmath30 and an impact parameter @xmath31 .    by inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : eikonal ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : action ] ) , we see that the dynamics of the trajectory - dependent quasiparticles ( represented by the field @xmath32 ) is governed by the andreev  @xcite hamiltonian @xmath33 @xmath34 which has the form of a one - dimensional superconductor with an effective pair potential @xmath35 . for a given classical trajectory , @xmath36 exhibits rapid variations that we wish to treat via an averaging procedure . to properly compute the disorder - averaged correlators of @xmath37 one",
    "must solve newton s equation for @xmath38 in the presence of a given realization of @xmath14 and then average over all such realizations .",
    "we shall not attempt such a difficult calculation ; however , on general grounds we expect that @xmath36 has zero mean and short - range correlations beyond @xmath16 .",
    "we shall analyze @xmath5 by studying the andreev bound states associated with sign changes in @xmath37 using the rsrg . before discussing how this works ,",
    "let us briefly review previous results for this one - dimensional random pair - potential hamiltonian ( we note that @xmath5 has appeared in several other condensed - matter contexts  @xcite ) . the disorder - averaged low - energy density of states @xmath39 of @xmath5 was first obtained by ovchinnikov and rikhman  @xcite using a fokker - planck equation . in ref .",
    ", this same result was obtained by mapping @xmath5 to a one - dimensional random hopping model .",
    "more recently , the disorder - averaged single - particle green function @xmath40 of @xmath5 was obtained by balents and fisher  @xcite using a supersymmetry method .",
    "they found that @xmath41 $ ] for @xmath42 . in the appendix ,",
    "we reproduce these results using the rsrg technique ; here we note that , in the present context , this behavior signifies that the andreev bound state wavefunctions are exponentially localized but with a characteristic length scale that _ diverges _ at low energies ( i.e.  they become delocalized ) .",
    "finally , as discussed in refs  , @xmath5 is closely related to models of supersymmetric quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "in this section we discuss how the disorder - averaged low - energy properties of @xmath5 may be analyzed via a rsrg approach . of central importance in such an analysis",
    "are the sign - changes ( i.e. , zeroes ) of @xmath37  @xcite .",
    "henceforth , our qualitative picture of @xmath37 along a trajectory is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , i.e. , it exhibits many sign changes . before considering the many sign - change case , however , let us consider an infinite system in which @xmath43 has exactly one sign change . in this case , @xmath44 has an exact zero - energy ( ze ) eigenstate of the form  @xcite @xmath45 where the @xmath46 corresponds to the case @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) for @xmath49 and we have omitted an overall normalization factor .",
    "indeed , the normalizability of eq .",
    "( [ eq : susystate ] ) relies on the existence of the sign change in @xmath37 .",
    "the subscript @xmath50 enters when we consider the case in which the pair potential has multiple sign changes ; henceforth it shall refer to the @xmath50th zero @xmath51 of @xmath37 and refer to @xmath52 as the ze state associated with @xmath51 . in the case",
    "in which @xmath37 has multiple sign changes , however , we must account for tunneling corrections @xmath53 between nearest - neighbor ze states ( i.e.  they are no longer at zero energy ) .",
    "a direct calculation gives  @xcite @xmath54 where the prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "=    0.50 cm    having identified the ze states @xmath55 associated with the zeroes of @xmath37 , we now turn to the rsrg analysis of such states . although it is formally similar to that studied in refs .  , there are conceptual differences which are important .",
    "the essential result of such an analysis is the following : although the matrix elements @xmath56 coupling the @xmath55 may be large , there are effective ze states associated with _",
    "sign changes which are weakly coupled and which may be treated via perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , the couplings between such effective ze states have a probability distribution which is universal in a sense discussed below . to begin",
    ", we note that for a given realization of the pair potential , there exists a strongest matrix element @xmath57 .",
    "the ze states associated with this matrix element are strongly coupled , forming symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions at energies @xmath58 .",
    "the difference between these energies defines our initial bandwidth @xmath59 . to estimate the magnitude of @xmath60",
    ", we first assume the impurities are dense enough such that the exponential factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tee ] ) is negligible .",
    "then , we assume that @xmath61 near an extended impurity of size @xmath15 . using @xmath62",
    ", we have @xmath63 .",
    "generally , we are interested in an observable at some low - energy @xmath64 ; the rsrg progressively eliminates all pairs of ze states coupled by matrix elements larger than @xmath65 . to see what this means ,",
    "let us examine fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tee ] ) , the matrix elements @xmath56 are exponentially dependent on the pair - potential integral @xmath66 between pairs of sites . thus , in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the strongest matrix element is that connecting sites @xmath67 and @xmath68 , ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) since the aforementioned integral is smallest for them . to obtain the decimation procedure ,",
    "we recall that the the sites @xmath51 are _ defined _ by the sign changes of @xmath36 along a particular trajectory .",
    "the fact that @xmath70 is only slightly above zero for the segment between @xmath67 and @xmath68 suggests that we could have simply _ ignored _ the sign changes at @xmath67 and @xmath68 without making any appreciable error in computing physical quantities .",
    "this defines a new description of @xmath5 : a basis of ze states that are associated with all sign changes of @xmath37 _ except _ those at sites @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the effect of these zeroes of @xmath37 is incorporated into a weak matrix element between the _ effective _ ze states at sites @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( that are each associated with three sign changes of @xmath37 )",
    ". this procedure exchanges four ze states for two weakly - coupled ze states ( and lowers the bandwidth to @xmath73 ) .",
    "the associated matrix element @xmath74 between the effective ze states at sites @xmath71 and @xmath72 is still given by the general formula eq .",
    "( [ eq : tee ] ) ; it is easy to see that this formula has the following recursion property : @xmath75    remarkably , this recursion relation is the same as that obtained by fisher  @xcite for the random antiferromagnetic spin chain ; the existence of such a relation is the reason the rsrg works in this seemingly unrelated system .",
    "it is convenient to define ( as was done in the random spin chain case  @xcite ) logarithmic matrix - element strengths @xmath76 and arc lengths @xmath77 .",
    "it is useful to note that up to a constant ( defined so that the minimum @xmath78 is zero ) , @xmath78 is essentially the abovementioned pair - potential integral @xmath66 that motivated the decimation scheme .",
    "a particular ( trajectory - dependent ) form for @xmath44 defines an initial probability distribution @xmath79 for the @xmath80 and @xmath81 , in which ze states have been assigned to all sign changes of @xmath43 .",
    "how do these values evolve under the rsrg decimation ? once sites @xmath67 and @xmath68 have been decimated , the new effective arc length is clearly @xmath82 .",
    "this , along with eq .",
    "( [ eq : recursion ] ) , implies that    @xmath83    where in eq .",
    "( [ eq : recur1 ] ) we have used the fact that ( as noted in ref .  ) since the matrix element connecting @xmath67 and @xmath68 is assumed to be the strongest , @xmath84 by definition . by iterating this procedure ,",
    "we produce a basis set of ze states which are more weakly coupled each iteration ( and which are associated with progressively more sign changes of @xmath37 ) but which still contain all the low energy physics of @xmath5 . as mentioned above , although their physical origin is slightly different , the recursion rules for the @xmath85 and the @xmath81 are the same as those studied by fisher for random spin chains",
    ". the essential results of this work ( for our purposes ) are the number of sites @xmath86 remaining after having lowered the bandwidth ( by decimating ) to energy @xmath87 and the asymptotic ( @xmath88 ) probability distribution @xmath89 , which is given by  @xcite    @xmath90    here , @xmath91 is the laplace transform of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the integration constant @xmath94 defines the length scale over which @xmath95 varies .",
    "we assume this is given by the typical value of @xmath95 in the initial distribution , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "having outlined the rsrg technique , we now apply it to the calcuation of a specific quantity : the microwave conductivity of a d - wave superconductor disordered by extended impurities , averaged over all realizations of the disorder . before embarking on the calculation , let us discuss the physical picture .",
    "we are interested in the possibility of the andreev bound state quasiparticles contributing to the microwave conductivity . from the outset it is not obvious that they will do so , since they are nominally localized",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : susystate ] ) ] near a particular sign change . the results of balents and fisher for the green function @xmath40 of @xmath5 give hope to this possibility , revealing that the quasiparticles become delocalized at asymptotically low energies .",
    "as the conductivity is related to a two - particle green function ( see below ) , the results of ref .",
    "are not sufficient to compute the conductivity . however , as we shall see the peculiar way in which tunneling corrections conspire to form _ effective _ andreev bound states associated with many sign changes conspires to give an interesting contribution to the microwave conductivity . for a given realization of the disorder ,",
    "the real part of the microwave conductivity @xmath97 is given by the kubo formula  @xcite :    @xmath98    here , @xmath99 is the area of the system and to obtain the retarded polarization tensor we use the usual analytic continuation @xmath100 .",
    "the angle brackets represent the thermodynamic average with respect to the action @xmath101 .",
    "we shall denote the disorder average by square brackets ; however , before attempting to evaluate this average we first simplify eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi ] ) for @xmath102 .    within the semiclassical approximation of sec .",
    "[ sec : bdg ] , @xmath103 is obtained by inserting eq .",

    "( [ eq : pi2 ] ) as a sum of two terms , one of which gives a vanishing contribution to @xmath110 .",
    "the other contribution to @xmath109 may conveniently be expressed in terms of the normalized eigenstates @xmath111 ( with eigenvalues @xmath112 ) of @xmath5 : @xmath113 where , since we are interested in @xmath114 , we have displayed @xmath115 directly .    turning to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmafin ] ) , we see that for the conductivity we require the disorder average of @xmath116 _ multiplied _ by @xmath117 . at low energies ,",
    "the ze states hybridize and become delocalized along the classical trajectories . by contrast",
    ", the average of @xmath117 is expected to vanish on long length scales as the classical trajectories bounce off the extended impurities .",
    "thus , it is sensible to approximate the average of the product of these quantities by the product of the averages ; furthermore we shall approximate for the classical problem @xmath118_{\\rm dis . }",
    "\\simeq \\exp(-|s - s'|/\\ell)$ ] i.e. , exponentially decaying correlations .",
    "we believe that the precise form of this correlator is unimportant at low energies . however , we note that the virtue of this form is that it naturally interpolates between ballistic motion on short length scales ( i.e.  @xmath119_{\\rm dis . } = s^2 $ ] for @xmath120 ) and diffusive motion on long length scales ( i.e.  @xmath119_{\\rm dis . } = 2s/\\ell$ ] for @xmath121 ) .",
    "next , we turn to the computation of the disorder average of @xmath116 , for which we require the rsrg analysis .",
    "the purpose of the rsrg is to eliminate ( decimating until @xmath122 ) all the strong matrix elements so that we are left with an effective theory having only weak ( i.e.  @xmath123 ) matrix elements between ze states , allowing the use of perturbation theory .",
    "following fisher  @xcite , we assume that the broadness of @xmath124 indictates that the disorder average is dominated by a class of rare pair - potential configurations that provide a large contribution . for the disorder average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : imagk ] ) , the class we have in mind is when an undecimated pair of states is separated by @xmath125 _ exactly _ ; the relative number of such configurations with logarithmic matrix element strength @xmath126 is simply given by @xmath127 . for a given @xmath126 and to leading - order in perturbation theory ( a similar calculation was done in ref .  ) , the ze states at @xmath28 and @xmath128 form symmetric ( @xmath26 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath99 ) wavefunctions with energies @xmath129 ( recall we have set @xmath122 ) . at low energies , the only terms which contribute appreciably to the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : imagk ] ) are these states ( i.e.  @xmath130 ) .",
    "thus , we have ( upon summing over all such configurations which amounts to integrating over @xmath126 )    @xmath131_{\\rm dis.}\\ !   & \\propto&\\ ! n_\\omega \\int_0^{\\infty } d\\zeta p(\\zeta,|s - s'|;\\omega ) \\\\ & & \\times\\delta(\\omega - \\omega{\\rm e}^{-\\zeta } )",
