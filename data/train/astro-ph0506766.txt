    "damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( hereafter dlas ) are defined as quasar absorption systems with neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath21 .",
    "they are generally considered to be progenitors of present - day galaxies , in the form of fast rotating disks ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) , or merging protogalactic clumps ( haehnelt _ et al .",
    "they serve as an important gas reservoir for star formation at high redshifts ( e.g. storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ) .",
    "molecular gas , especially molecular hydrogen , is an important ingredient of star formation , since stars form by cooling via molecular lines .",
    "the search for @xmath3 in dlas can be carried out by observing the @xmath3 absorption lines in the lyman x@xmath22b@xmath23 and werner x@xmath22c@xmath24 bands , with rest wavelengths from @xmath25 1220  to the lyman limit ( abgrall _ et al .",
    "_ 1993a , 1993b ) .",
    "ge & bechtold ( 1999 ) conducted a survey for @xmath3 absorption in 13 dlas , using the mmt spectrograph .",
    "two have been confirmed with significant @xmath3 fraction ; upper limits in the range of @xmath26 to @xmath27 were put on the @xmath3 fraction in other systems ( ge & bechtold 1997 , 1999 , ge _ et al .",
    "more recently , based on the high resolution spectra obtained with uves at the eso vlt , ledoux _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) searched for @xmath3 in a sample of 33 dlas , with firm detections of @xmath3 absorption in 8 of them .",
    "by contrast , almost every line of sight through galactic or magellanic gas clouds with comparable h  i column density has strong @xmath3 absorption ( e.g. shull _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 ) .    in the interstellar medium ,",
    "@xmath3 molecules are expected to form on the surface of dust grains by physical or chemical adsorption ( cazaux & tielens 2002 ) .",
    "therefore one contributing factor to the lack of @xmath3 in dlas is the low dust - to - gas ratios in these systems ( e.g. pei _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 , pettini _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 , vladilo 1998 , prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) , perhaps the result of the fact that quasar surveys tend to select objects which are bright and blue ( e.g. gregg _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 , khare _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) . a second contributing factor to the lack of @xmath3 may be the high gas temperature in dlas which makes @xmath3 formation onto dust grains inefficient ( petitjean _ et al .",
    "_ 2000 , liszt 2002 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion that unlike the local ism , the gas in dlas might be predominantly warm ( lu _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , prochaska & wolfe 1999 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath3 molecules are easily dissociated by uv photons in the energy range of 11.3  13.6 ev .",
    "therefore the low @xmath3 fraction in dlas may be the result of a strong uv radiation field ( e.g. black _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 ) , which could in turn be a signature of high star formation rate ( wolfe _ et al .",
    "_ 2003a , 2003b , 2004 ) .",
    "recently , hirashita _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the deficiency of @xmath3 in dlas may also be a result of the expected low volume filling factor of @xmath3 in environments with a strong uv radiation field and low dust - to - gas ratio , rather than a real absence of @xmath3 .",
    "q1331 + 170 ( at @xmath2 ) is one of the first high redshift quasars discovered ( baldwin _ et al .",

    "_ 1975 ) with a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath29 ( chaffee _ et al .",

    "the 21-cm absorption line was also detected ( wolfe & davis 1979 , chengalur & kanekar 2000 ) , with a spin temperature of @xmath30 .",
    "this implies the presence of a cold neutral medium ( cnm ) phase conducive to the efficient formation of @xmath3 onto dust grains ( petitjean _ et al .",
    "one of the most interesting features in the absorption spectrum of q1331 + 170 is the presence of strong c  i and c  i * multiple lines near @xmath31 ( meyer _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , songaila _ et al .",
    "c  i absorption has been found to be rare in quasar absorbers as compared to galactic diffuse clouds as a result of higher uv radiation fields , or lower dust abundances ( ge _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 , 2001 ) . since these conditions would also be inhospitable to an appreciable formation of @xmath3 , the damped ly@xmath0 absorber toward q1331 + 170",
    "is an excellent candidate for a search for @xmath3 absorption .",
    "detecting c  i is also of cosmological interest , since it is insensitive to the local physical conditions , but depends strongly on the cosmic background level ( liszt 2002 ) .",
    "therefore the fine structure transitions of c  i can be used to measure the cmb temperature as a function of redshift ( e.g. bahcall _ et al .",

    "for this reason , we checked our continuum fit according to the following prescription .",
    "we separate the whole spectrum into several continuous wavelength regions , and for each region , we construct the histogram of all the data points with normalized flux greater than 1 . ideally , the histogram can be well represented by a ( half-)gaussian distribution with a standard deviation corresponding to the normalized @xmath43 error of our spectrum .",
    "next , we adjust the best - fit continuum in the region under consideration until the calculated gaussian standard deviation is approximately equal to the average normalized @xmath43 error in the same region .",
    "the above procedure was performed in an iterative manner , since an adjustment of the continuum also changes the ( normalized ) @xmath43 error used for comparison .",
    "this procedure can be used to determine both the overall amplitude and shape of the continuum .",
    "we estimate the accuracy of continuum fitting by calculating the reduced @xmath44-deviation between the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of normalized flux adopting the best - fit continuum and that with continuum level scaled by a certain factor ( ranging from 50% lower to 50% higher ) . here",
    "only pixels with normalized flux greater than 1 are considered .",

    "the two dashed lines in fig . 1 correspond to the best - fit continuum scaled 15% lower and 15% higher .",
    "this represents a very conservative estimate of the uncertainty in the continuum fit ; clearly the dashed lines are inconsistent with the expected continuum level in portions of the spectrum .",
    "the effects of the possible uncertainties in continuum fitting on our final results are discussed in sec .",
    "previous spectroscopic studies show that there are at least five redshift systems with detectable metal absorption lines along the line of sight toward q1331 + 170 .",

    "we searched for molecular hydrogen absorption associated with the @xmath28 dla and two other absorbers at @xmath47 and @xmath48 , since their redshifts allow considerable overlap between the wavelength coverage of our spectrum and the redshifted lyman and werner bands of @xmath3 . by comparing with the synthetic @xmath3 spectrum , we detected strong molecular hydrogen absorption associated with the @xmath28 damped ly@xmath0 system , whereas the @xmath3 line pattern does not match the observed spectrum for the other two absorbers .",

    "since the determination of column densities is very sensitive to the choice of @xmath69-parameter on the flat part of the curve of growth , the uncertainties in @xmath97 and @xmath98 are relatively larger than the column densities at lower @xmath6 states . although @xmath65 lines are on the linear part of the curve of growth , the @xmath43 error in @xmath99 is also relatively large due to the low signal - to - noise ratio for these weaker lines .",

    "3.2 ) , the corresponding uncertainties in @xmath3 column densities at @xmath63 and @xmath96 can be relatively large .",

    "a unique temperature for rotational excitation of @xmath3 is not characteristic of galactic @xmath3 clouds , and the populations of rotational states of @xmath3 often require at least two different excitation temperatures ( e.g. spitzer & cochran 1973 ) .",

    "_ 1974 ) . for the damped ly@xmath0 absorber of q1331 + 170 , a unique excitation temperature for all states from @xmath61 to @xmath67 indicates that the rotational populations of @xmath3 are probably dominated by collisional excitation in a gas with kinetic temperature around @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , the local uv radiation field does not significantly populate the high @xmath6 states of @xmath3 molecules .",
