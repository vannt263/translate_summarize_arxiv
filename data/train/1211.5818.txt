    "spin torque switching @xcite of a magnetization in nanostructured ferromagnets has attracted much attention due to its potential application to spintronics devices , such as spin random access memory ( spin ram ) @xcite .",
    "an accurate estimation of the thermal stability , @xmath8 , is very important for these applications , where the thermal stability is defined as the ratio of the magnetic anisotropy energy to the temperature ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "for example , the retention time of the spin ram exponentially depends on the thermal stability @xcite .",
    "the thermal stability is experimentally determined by measuring the spin torque switching in the thermally activated region @xcite , and analyzing the switching probability @xcite with the formula @xmath10 $ ] , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the switching rate and the attempt frequency , respectively .",
    "similar to many other non - equilibrium systems @xcite , the exponent of the switching rate can be written in the form , @xmath13 is the energy barrier height of the switching divided by the temperature . in this paper , we call @xmath14 the switching barrier .",
    "the thermal stability is defined as @xmath8 .",
    "here , @xmath15 and @xmath0 are the current and the critical current of the spin torque switching at zero temperature . equation ( [ eq : barrier ] )",
    "characterizes the switching in the thermally activated region , and is applicable for @xmath16 .",
    "the exponent of the term @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : barrier ] ) is denoted as @xmath4 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : barrier ] ) was analytically derived for the uniaxially anisotropic system by solving the fokker - planck equation @xcite , and @xmath18 .",
    "recently , it has also been confirmed by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to derive the analytical formula of the switching barrier for an in - plane magnetized system , which does not have axial symmetry due to the presence of two anisotropic axes ( an easy axis along the in - plane and a hard axis normal to the plane ) .",
    "previous analyses adopted @xmath19 , which has been obtained by solving the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite as well as the fokker - planck equation @xcite .",
    "the point of these works is that the effect of the spin torque on the switching barrier can be described by the effective temperature @xcite @xmath20 .",
    "however , the effective temperature approach is valid only for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the current dependence of the switching barrier in a relatively large current region @xmath22 remains unclear , while such large current is applied to a ferromagnet in experiments to quickly observe the switching .",
    "these facts motivated us to study the switching barrier in the large current region . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we numerically solved the llg equation of the in - plane magnetized system , and found that the switching does not occur even if @xmath23 , although @xmath0 has been assumed to be the critical current of the spin torque switching at zero temperature .",
    "we also found that the exponent @xmath4 is larger than 2 by analyzing the numerical results with a phenomenological model of the switching @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an analytical theory of the spin torque switching of an in - plane magnetized system based on the fokker - planck theory with wkb approximations @xcite , where the temperature is assumed to be low , and the magnitudes of the damping and the spin torque are assumed to be small . by assuming that the solution of the fokker - planck equation is given by @xmath24 , we find that the switching barrier is given by @xmath25 the physical meaning of eq .",
    "( [ eq : barrier_definition_intro ] ) is as follows .",
    "the numerator in the integral arises from the drift terms of the fokker - planck equation , where the terms @xmath26 and @xmath27 are proportional to the work done by spin torque and the energy dissipation due to the damping , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", the denominator arises from the diffusion term of the fokker - planck equation , where the thermal fluctuation depends on the damping constant @xmath28 and the temperature @xmath29 through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "then , the switching barrier is given by the integral of the ratio between the drift and the diffusion terms .",
    "the boundaries of the integral , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are defined by the region of @xmath32 , because the energy dissipation due to the damping overcomes the spin torque in this region , and thus , the energy absorption from the thermal bath is required to climb up the switching barrier .",
    "the thermally activated region is defined as the current region @xmath33 , where @xmath1 satisfies @xmath34 at the saddle point of the energy map .",
    "the relation between @xmath0 in the conventional theory @xcite and @xmath1 is as follows .",
    "the initial state parallel to the easy axis becomes unstable at @xmath35 .",
    "however , the condition @xmath36 does not guarantee the switching . on the other hand , at @xmath37 ,",
    "the switching occurs without the thermal fluctuation .",
    "we derive the analytical expression of @xmath1 , and find that @xmath38 .",
    "we also find that the current dependence of the switching barrier is well described by @xmath3 , where the value of the exponent @xmath4 is approximately unity for the current @xmath5 , while @xmath4 rapidly increases up to @xmath6 with increasing current for @xmath7 , showing a good agreement with refs .",
