    "as we know the famous example of ads / cft correspondence [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] is the relation between type iib string theory in the @xmath0 space and a @xmath1 super yang - mills gauge theory on the 4-dimensional boundary of @xmath2 space .",
    "this duality has been extended to a different cases .",
    "for example it can describe confining gauge theories such as qcd . in order to have a more realistic description of the strongly coupled quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) we have to apply such duality . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the remarkable link between black hole thermodynamics and field theory arise by the holography .",
    "we note here for the providing complete information about the field theory .",
    "the ads / cft help us to provide dual descriptions of any desired process in the gauge theory .",
    "we do not expect to find simple description to obtain full information of the gauge theory .",
    "in thermodynamic point of view it is natural to expect that the long - distance fluctuations in the theory we have hydrodynamic description . in the hydrodynamics we have some important quantities such as shear viscosity , which plays important role in physics of early universe .",
    "such studies are important to understand the physics of the early universe",
    ". the most important problems of qgp are the shear viscosity , drag force and jet - quenching parameter .",
    "it is found that the ratio of shear viscosity @xmath3 to the entropy density @xmath4 had a universal value , i.e. , @xmath5 [ 4 - 19 ] .",
    "however for the general case of the coupled system it can be shown that @xmath6 .",
    "previous computation of the shear viscosity usually based on the kubo formula . in this paper",
    ", we use diffusion constant [ 4 ] to obtain the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density for the three - charged black hole in the stu model with higher derivative correction .",
    "the stu model admits a chemical potential for the @xmath7 symmetry and this makes it more interesting .",
    "already the shear viscosity in the stu background computed [ 9,10 ] and higher derivative effects of the five - dimensional gauged supergravity [ 20 ] applied on the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy [ 21 ] .",
    "the stu model is an example of @xmath8 , @xmath9 gauged supergravity theory [ 22 ] which is dual to the @xmath1 sym theory with finite chemical potential .",
    "the @xmath10 supergravity theory in five dimensions can be obtained by compactification of the eleven dimensional supergravity in a three - fold calabi - yau [ 23 ] .",
    "the @xmath8 , @xmath9 gauged supergravity theory is a natural way to explore gauge / gravity duality , and three - charge non - extremal black holes are important thermal background for this correspondence .",
    "for these reasons we already calculated the quantities of the drag force and jet - quenching parameter in the stu background [ 24 - 27 ] .",
    "+ another important property of the qgp is called the jet - quenching parameter , so the knowledge about this parameter increases our understanding about the qgp . in that case",
    "the jet - quenching parameter is obtained by calculating the expectation value of a closed light - like wilson loop and using the dipole approximation [ 28 ] . in order to calculate this parameter in qcd",
    "one needs to use perturbation theory .",
    "but by using ads / cft correspondence the jet - quenching parameter calculated in the non - perturbative quantum field theory .",
    "this calculations performed in the @xmath1 sym thermal plasma [ 29 - 35 ] . in the ref .",
    "[ 27 ] we calculated the jet - quenching parameter in the stu background include a black hole with three charges .",
    "we should note that our paper is extension of the refs . [",
    "10 ] and [ 21 ] because we are going to consider the stu model with three different charges .",
    "+ there are also interesting hydrodynamical quantity such as thermal and electrical conductivity which can be calculated from gauge / gravity duality . in the recent work [ 36 ]",
    "the thermal and electrical conductivity calculated in the presence of non - zero chemical potential and found that conductivities for gauge theories dual to r - charged black hole in @xmath11 behaves in a universal manner . in the ref .",
    "[ 36 ] r - charged black holes in arbitrary dimension considered and electrical conductivity computed .",
    "we use results of the ref . [ 36 ] to write an expression for electrical conductivity as a hydrodynamical property of the qgp . +",
    "this paper organized as the following . in section 2",
    "we give brief review of the stu model . in section 3",
    "we calculate the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density by using the diffusion constant . in section 4",
    "we obtain the effect of higher derivative corrections on the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density .",
    "then in section 5 we extract thermal and electrical conductivities , and discuss the effect of higher derivative correction . in section 6 we calculate the shear viscosity to entropy ratio by using density of physical charge . finally in section 7",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "the stu model is the special form of the @xmath10 supergravity in different dimensions , and generally has 8-charge non - extremal black hole ( 4 electric and 4 magnetic ) .",
    "however , there are many situations for the charge configurations such as four - charge and three - charge black holes .",
    "there is great difference between three - charge and four - charge black hole .",
    "for example if there are only 3 charges in 4 dimensions , then the entropy vanishes ( except in the non - bps case ) , so one really needs four charges to get a regular black hole . in 5 dimensions the situation is different and actually much simpler , there is no distinction between bps and non - bps branch , in this dimension the three - charge configurations are the most interesting ones [ 37 ] .",
    "therefore , we begin with the three - charge non - extremal black hole solution in @xmath10 gauged supergravity which is called stu model and described by the following solution [ 38 ] , @xmath12 where , @xmath13 and , @xmath14 where @xmath15 are @xmath16 , pseudo - sphere and flat spaces , respectively .",
    "@xmath17 is the inverse curvature of @xmath2 and related to the cosmological constant via @xmath18 . in stu model",
    "there are three real scalar fields as @xmath19 which satisfy the following condition , @xmath20 . in another word ,",
    "if we set @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 then there is @xmath24 condition .",
    "+ the hawking temperature of the solution ( 1 ) is given by the following relation , @xmath25 also the chemical potential is given by , @xmath26 it is clear that at @xmath27 limit the chemical potential vanishes and the hawking temperature reduces to one in the @xmath28 sym theory , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we are going to study universality of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density , @xmath30 .",
    "there are several ways to compute the shear viscosity such as the kubo formula [ 39 , 40 ] . in this paper",
    "we use diffusion constant approach to extract the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density . in that case for a given metric , @xmath31 , the diffusion constant becomes [ 4 ] , @xmath32 we should note that the equation ( 6 ) works only for the case of flat space where @xmath33 .",
    "then , in order to investigate universality of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density we use @xmath34 . by using the line element ( 1 )",
    "one can obtain the following expansion , @xmath35,\\ ] ] also by using the hawking temperature ( 4 ) we can obtain the following expression for the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density , @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is root of the equation @xmath38 ( and we set @xmath39 ) . here , the first term in the relation ( 8) for @xmath27 , agree with universality of the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy which is @xmath5 .",
    "our main goal is computing the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy from stu model for three different charges .",
    "now we are going to discuss several aspect of this theory , so we consider three special cases . in the first step",
    "we assume @xmath40 . in that case from the relation ( 8) we have , @xmath41,\\ ] ] where horizon radius obtained as the following ( root of the @xmath38 ) , @xmath42 by inserting the equation ( 10 ) into the relation ( 9 ) we can obtain @xmath30 in terms of black hole charge .",
    "so we draw figure of the ratio @xmath30 in terms of @xmath43 for three different space in the fig .",
