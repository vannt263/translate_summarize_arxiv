    "we are faced with a peculiar phase crossover , where all components of the dynamics are strongly mixed and thus both energy centroids @xmath113 and widths @xmath114 become affected in a non - trivial way by the presence of the non - hermitian component . a similar interplay between single - particle energies and the residual pairing interaction",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of a complex open quantum many - body system . the coupling to external degrees of freedom can be viewed as a coupling to a radiation field , to continuum states or to a measuring apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> this perturbation is treated in terms of an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of such coupling on the properties of the many - body dynamics is discussed , with emphasis on new effects related to dynamical segregation of fast and slow decays and the phase transition to dicke superradiance . </S>",
    "<S> relations to quantum optics , continuum shell model , theory of measurement , quantum chaos , percolation theory , and to quantum reactions are stressed . </S>"
