    "it was declared in @xcite that with a symmetric potential gives always a wigner function symmetric in the spatial coordinate : @xmath11 , no matter what profile of the injected carrier distribution is . actually , it is not true for all the symmetric potential functions .",
    "for example , when @xmath12 , the wigner equation will reduce to its classical counterpart , the boltzmann equation ( the liouville equation ) @xmath13 one may figure out the solution of by examining rolling balls to a hill with a shape @xmath12 . when one roll a ball with the initial kinetic energy less than the height of @xmath2 ( which is @xmath14 at @xmath15 ) , it is impossible to find the ball on the right hand side .",
    "this implies that a symmetric potential can not assure a symmetric distribution .",
    "let us put forward a question :    _ for which class of symmetric potential the equation always has a symmetric solution for any inflow boundary conditions ? _    in this paper , we answer this question partly by proving that for a symmetric and periodic potential with a period @xmath16 , the wigner equation with inflow boundary conditions has one and only one symmetric solution .",
    "the proof hereafter is based on the elegant approach of the well - posedness of the stationary wigner equation with inflow boundary conditions in @xcite .",
    "the proof in @xcite is given only for the discrete velocity version of the wigner equation providing that @xmath17 is excluded from the discrete velocity points adopted .",
    "what under our consideration is the continuous version of the wigner equation with the periodic condition of the potential function . by the periodicity of @xmath2 , we first simplify the wigner equation to a form equivalent to its discrete velocity version",
    ". then we are able to make use of the well - posedness theorem in @xcite to prove the symmetric property .    in @xcite ,",
    "a center finite - difference method was proposed to provide a symmetric solution .",
    "it was declared therein that the numerical solution will give an asymmetric solution in case of the first - order upwind finite difference scheme used .",
    "this indicates that the first - order upwind finite difference scheme will not converge to the exact solution at all , which is predicted theoretically to be symmetric in @xmath18 .",
    "it argued that the strange numerical behavior is due to that the center scheme is more physical than the upwind scheme .",
    "on doubt of this point of view , we revisit the numerical example in @xcite using three different numerical schemes , including the two schemes used in @xcite and a second - order upwind finite difference schemes .",
    "our numerical results demonstrate that the first - order finite difference method and the second - order upwind finite difference scheme can also give symmetric solutions as long as the gird size is small enough .",
    "moreover , the symmetry of the numerical solution can be quantitatively bounded by the accuracy of the numerical solution .",
    "thus it is found out that whether the numerical solution is symmetric is not only related to numerical scheme , but also related to the numerical accuracy .    the remain part of this paper is arranged as below : in section 2 , we prove the symmetry of the solution of with symmetric potential and in section 3 , the numerical study of the example in @xcite is presented .",
    "in general , the well - posedness of the boundary value problem ( bvp ) for the stationary wigner equation @xmath19 with the inflow boundary conditions @xmath20 is an open problem @xcite .    at first , we expand the potential @xmath2 into a fourier series .",
    "the fourier series is uniformly converged to @xmath2 under mild conditions , e.g. , if @xmath2 is periodic , continuous , and its derivative @xmath21 is piecewise continuous .",
    "particularly , if @xmath2 is symmetric with respect to @xmath22-axis , i.e. it is an even function , we can expand it to cosine series . in this paper , we consider a special case in which the potential function @xmath2 defining @xmath23 through is a periodic ( @xmath24 ) , even function with an absolutely convergent fourier series , i.e. , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is finite .",
    "several sufficient conditions for @xmath2 to have an absolutely convergent fourier series are given in @xcite , e.g. , if @xmath2 is absolutely continuous in @xmath28 $ ] and @xmath29 $ ] , then @xmath2 has an absolutely convergent fourier series .",
    "we will prove that the boundary value problem ( bvp ) , is well - posed , and its solution is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath11 , @xmath30 , no matter what profile of the injected carrier distribution is , providing that @xmath2 has an expansion . for @xmath2 with an expansion in , a direct calculation of yields @xmath31 thus , plugging into the wigner equation , we reformulate the stationary dimensionless wigner equation as @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    observing , one can see that @xmath35 can be viewed as a parameter , and can be regarded as a set of ordinary differential equations , and @xmath36 only couples with @xmath37 .",
    "the bvp with inflow boundary conditions can be decoupled into independent ordinary differential systems indexed by @xmath38 @xmath39 under the inflow boundary conditions @xmath40 where @xmath41 .",
    "notice that we have to neglect the case @xmath42 until now .",
    "if @xmath43 , becomes an algebraic - differential system and its property is quite different , and it will bring difficulty to the theoretical analysis @xcite . and to the authors best knowledge , @xmath17 is also excluded from the sampling velocity set in all numerical simulation papers e.g. , @xcite .",

    "the discrete velocity @xmath48 are strictly increasing , i.e. , @xmath49 . considering the singularity of the equation when @xmath50 , we have excluded @xmath17 from @xmath51 by setting @xmath52 .",
    "henceforth , we omit the superscript @xmath53 of @xmath44 , @xmath54 , @xmath51 and @xmath55 when no confusion happens .",
