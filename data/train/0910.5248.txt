    "the origin of large - scale cosmic magnetic fields in galaxies and protogalaxies remains a challenging problem in astrophysics @xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to explain the origin of cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "one of the first popular astrophysical theories to create seed fields was the biermann mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this mechanism acts in diverse astrophysical systems , such as large scale structure formation @xcite , cosmological ionizing fronts @xcite , star formation and supernova explosions @xcite . @xcite",
    "made simulations showing that cosmological shocks can create average magnetic fields of a few @xmath4 inside cluster / groups , @xmath5 around clusters / groups , and @xmath6 in filaments .",
    "@xcite showed that magnetic fields can be produced by collisionless shocks in galaxy clusters and in the intercluster medium ( icm ) during large scale structure formation .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies coupled with hierarchical structure formation .",
    "@xcite investigated second - order couplings between photons and electrons as a possible origin of magnetic fields on cosmological scales before the epoch of recombination .",
    "the creation of early magnetic fields generated by cosmological perturbations have also been investigated @xcite .    in our galaxy ,",
    "the magnetic field is coherent over kpc scales with alternating directions in the arm and inter - arm regions ( e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "such alternations are expected for magnetic fields of primordial origin @xcite .",
    "various observations put upper limits on the intensity of a homogeneous primordial magnetic field .",
    "observations of the small - scale cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy yield an upper comoving limit of @xmath7 for a homogeneous primordial field @xcite .",
    "reionization of the universe puts upper limits of @xmath8 for a homogeneous primordial field , depending on the assumptions of the stellar population that is responsible for reionizing the universe @xcite .",
    "another upper limit for a homogenous primordial magnetic field is the magnetic jeans mass @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "thus , if we are investigating the collapse of a @xmath10 protogalaxy , the homogeneous primordial magnetic field must be @xmath11 in order for collapse to occur .",
    "galactic magnetic fields have been suggested to have evolved in three main stages . in the first stage ,",
    "seed fields were embedded in the protogalaxy . they may have had a primordial origin , as suggested in this paper .",
    "another possibility is that the seed fields could have been injected into the protogalaxies by agn jets , radio lobes , supernovas , or a combination of the above .",
    "still another possibility is that the seed fields may have been created by the biermann battery during the formation of the protogalaxy . in the second stage , the seed fields were amplified by compression , shearing flows , turbulent flows , magneto - rotational instabilities , dynamos or by a combination of the above . in the last stage magnetic fields",
    "were ordered by a large scale dynamo @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the amplification of magnetic fields due to turbulent vorticity created at cosmological shocks during the formation of large scale structures .",
    "a given vorticity @xmath12 can be characterized by a characteristic velocity @xmath13 over a characteristic distance @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath12 typically is @xmath15 which corresponds to 10 - 30 turnovers in the age of the universe .",
    "they investigated @xmath16 1 mpc @xmath17 .",
    "we investigate @xmath18 200 kpc @xmath17 in protogalaxies for a similar vorticity .",
    "we show that a seed field @xmath19 over a comoving @xmath20 region at _ z _ @xmath21 , predicted by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite , amplified by the small scale dynamo is a good candidate for the origin of magnetic fields in galaxies . @xcite and @xcite derived the non - linear evolution equations for the magnetic correlations .",
    "we use their formulation for the small scale dynamo and solve the nonlinear equations numerically . in  ii , we review the creation of magnetic fields due to electromagnetic fluctuations in hot dense equilibrium primordial plasmas , as described in our previous work @xcite . in  iii , we discuss the small scale dynamo and in  iv , the important parameters of the plasma to be used in the calculations . in ",
    "v , we present our results and in  vi our conclusions .",
    "thermal electromagnetic fluctuations are present in all plasmas , including those in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the level of the fluctuations is related to the dissipative characteristics of the plasma , as described by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite studied the evolution of these bubbles as the universe expanded and found that the magnetic fields in the bubbles , created originally at the quark - hadron phase transition ( qhpt ) , had a value @xmath22 g and a size 0.1 pc at the redshift @xmath23 ( see table 1 of @xcite ) . assuming that the fields are randomly oriented , the average magnetic field over a region d is @xmath24 .",
    "the theory thus predicts an average magnetic field @xmath19 over a @xmath25 region at @xmath23 .",
    "we assume this seed field and examine its amplification in a protogalaxy by the small scale dynamo , discussed in the next section .",
    "in a partially ionized medium , the magnetic field evolution is governed by the induction equation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the magnetic field , @xmath28 the velocity of the ionic component of the fluid and @xmath29 is the ohmic resistivity .",
    "let @xmath30 be the coherence scale of the turbulence .",
    "consider a system whose size is @xmath31 where the mean field , averaged over any scale , is negligible .",
    "we take @xmath32 to be a homogeneous , isotropic , gaussian random field with a negligible mean average value . for equal time",
    ", the two point correlation of the magnetic field is @xmath33[c ] where @xmath34 + m_{l}\\left ( \\frac{r^{\\,i}r^{\\,j}}{r^{\\,2}}\\right ) + h\\epsilon _ { \\,ijk}\\,r^{\\,k } , \\label{d}\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 are the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions , respectively , of the magnetic field and @xmath37 is the helical term of the correlations . since @xmath38 we have @xmath39 @xcite .",

    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the longitudinal and transverse correlation functions for the velocity field . the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are then related in the way described by @xcite , which we assume here .",
    "these equations for @xmath40 and @xmath51 describing the evolution of magnetic correlations at small and large scales .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath52 includes microscopic diffusion @xmath53 a scale - dependent turbulent diffusion @xmath54 , $ ] and a ambipolar drift @xmath55 which is proportional to the energy density of the fluctuating fields .",
    "similarly , @xmath56 is a scale - dependent @xmath57 effect , proportional to @xmath58.$ ] the nonlinear decrement of the @xmath57 effect due to ambipolar drift is @xmath59 proportional to the mean helicity of the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath60 term in equation ( [ ml ] ) allows for rapid generation of small scale magnetic fluctuations due to velocity shear @xcite .",
    "this turbulent spectrum simulates kolmogorov turbulence @xcite . as in the galactic interstellar medium",
    ", the protogalactic plasma is expected to have kolmogorov - turbulence , driven by the shock waves originating from the instabilities , associated with gravitational collapse .    in the galactic context",
    ", we can neglect the coupling term @xmath61 as a very good approximation since it is very small and consider only the evolution of @xmath40 @xcite .    for turbulent motions on a scale @xmath62 and a velocity scale @xmath63 ,",
    "the magnetic reynolds number ( mrn ) is @xmath64 .",
    "there is a critical mrn , @xmath65 , so that for @xmath66 @xcite , modes of the small scale dynamo can be excited .",
    "the fluctuating field , correlated on a scale @xmath62 , grows exponentially with a growth rate @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "we use the fiducial parameters , suggested in the literature for the plasma that was present in the protogalaxy @xcite : total mass m @xmath68 , temperature t @xmath69 k , and size @xmath70 .",
    "the ion kinematic viscosity is @xmath71 , the spitzer resistivity @xmath72 @xmath73 , and the typical eddy velocity @xmath74 .",
    "in fig . 1 , we evaluate @xmath40 for various values of r and in fig . 2 for various values of @xmath13 , solving numerically equation ( [ ml ] ) .",
    "in fig 3 we evaluate the mean value of the magnetic field as a function of r and t. our previous work @xcite showed that the natural fluctuations of the primordial plasma predicted by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem produces a cosmic web of randomly oriented dipole magnetic fields . the average field over a region @xmath75 kpc",
    "is predicted to be @xmath19 .",
    "we assume this seed field and examine its amplification by the small scale dynamo in s protogalaxy .",
    "this seed field corresponds to an @xmath76 .",
    "of particular interest is thus the growth of @xmath40 with an initial value @xmath77 in figs . 1 and 2 , for initial magnetic fields @xmath78 of size @xmath79 in fig .",
    "it was shown previously that the magnetic fields , created immediately after the quark - hadron transition , produce relatively intense magnetic dipole fields on small scales at @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we show here that the predicted seed fields of size @xmath75 kpc and intensity @xmath80 at _ z _ @xmath21 can be amplified by a small scale dynamo in protogalaxies to intensities close to observed values . in the small scale dynamo studied",
    ", we use the turbulent spectrum given by @xcite .",
    "the characteristic velocity @xmath13 and length @xmath14 , used in the expression for the vorticity @xmath81 , are @xmath82 and @xmath18 200 kpc .",
    "this vorticity is comparable to that found by @xcite , studying the formation of large scale structures .",
    "the length @xmath83 kpc used is a characteristic size of a protogalactic cloud .",
    "the turbulent spectrum used simulates kolmogorov turbulence @xcite . from our figs . 1 and 2",
    ", we find that @xmath84 increases from @xmath85 ( corresponding to a magnetic field @xmath86 over a region @xmath87 2 kpc ) to @xmath88 ( corresponding to a field @xmath89 over a region @xmath90 kpc ) in @xmath91 years .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath92 e - fold amplification of @xmath93 in a relatively short time .",
    "collapsing to form galaxies at redshift @xmath94 , the density increases by a factor of @xmath95 and the magnetic fields are amplified by a factor of @xmath96 .",
    "this predicts @xmath97 fields over 0.34 kpc regions in galaxies .",
    "if the dipole magnetic fields predicted by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem are not completely random , microgauss fields over regions @xmath98 kpc are easily obtained .",
