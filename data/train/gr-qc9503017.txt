    "the idea of a quasi - static and ever - lasting nonsingular universe seems still to be very attractive among cosmologists .",
    "it was first einstein @xcite who did not believe his equations could really give in general non - static solutions , until the clear arguments of friedman @xcite . with the discovery of hubble redshifting and the mathematical work of hawking and penrose @xcite about the inevitability of singularities rather few attention was paid to non - singular models of the universe until the eighties .",
    "however , singularity - free friedman models usually called bouncing models were considered early in thirties by robertson @xcite .",
    "these models appear whenever the cosmological constant , introduced by einstein to balance gravitational attraction , has a value between zero and a certain fixed number that gives the einstein static universe @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the universe begins with some minimum value of the scale factor and then expands forever .",
    "since the idea of inflation was established @xcite , the situation changed because the scalar field responsible for the scenario necessarily had to break the energy conditions giving the effective negative pressure ( repulsion ) so much demanded by einstein .    if we raise the question what are the ways to avoid singularities one can distinguish a couple of approaches . in some opinions one should consider a quantum gravity as an appropriate gravity theory at high densities .",
    "however , most of the approaches refer to the alternative to general relativity classical gravity theories .",
    "worth mentioning is the early proposal made by cartan @xcite of nonsymmetric connection gravity theory with torsion in which both isotropic and anisotropic universes start with a very small but non - zero size @xcite .",
    "petry @xcite considered a covariant gravity theory in which isotropic universes are always bouncing @xcite . in the nonsymmetric metric gravity theory of moffat @xcite the black hole",
    "is replaced by a superdense object @xcite .",
    "then , due to a repulsive force generated naturally in the theory , non - singular cosmological solutions should also be a rule .",
    "other examples are the higher gravity theories such as : the second - order @xmath1 theory @xcite with a bounce solution for negative curvature @xcite , the fourth - order @xmath2 theory @xcite and brandenberger s @xcite important proposal in which all isotropic solutions are the de sitter , though non - singular , type .",
    "if we stay within general relativity we can keep the simple robertson - walker geometry and either assume a specific equation of state for friedman models @xcite or explore the scalar field coupled to gravity .",
    "both approaches are actually equivalent since the scalar field can mimic different equations of state @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to consider singularity - free bouncing friedman universes within general relativity admitting some fraction of negative pressure matter usually believed to describe cosmic strins and domain walls which we will be calling from now on , for the sake of some generality , string - like - matter and wall - like - matter @xcite .",
    "the physical motivation for taking exotic matter into consideration is that we still do not have a solution of the dark non - baryonic matter problem .",
    "one can strongly believe , in the context of particle physics , that the exotic matter may be a very good candidate for the dark matter . if it appeared that the exotic matter existed one would believe in the non - singular universes of this paper . however , there exixts some objections referring to the compatibility of the domain walls with observations @xcite .",
    "although some other suggestions emerged @xcite , it is believed that even if walls formed in the early universe , they should decay by the present @xcite . in order to avoid the domain walls and perhaps to give more freedom in compatibility with observations we replace the string - like - matter and wall - like - matter by scalar fields .",
    "we postulate that scalar fields may be the candidates for the dark matter in the present era of the universe @xcite .",
    "our procedure is similar to the procedure applied for inflationary universes @xcite .",
    "first we assume the exotic equation of state and then we derive the form of the scalar field potentials .",
    "among non - singular solutions we select those which are oscillating i.e. those for which the scale factor oscillates between certain fixed values .",
    "such solutions first mentioned by harrison @xcite and recently discussed by kardashev @xcite originate from a qualitative change for bouncing models @xcite after taking the negative pressure matter into account and admitting negative cosmological constant .",
    "these solutions have both contracting and expanding phase , so they may be compatible with the astronomical data .",
    "they last infinitely in time which might be satisfactory at least from philosophical point of view .",
    "oscillating models might also have another advantage .",
    "since they are quasi - static and require a similar balance to static models , then , according to the analysis of gibbons @xcite , they should posses very large entropy with value close a maximum admissible for the einstein static universe .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the existence of oscillating friedman solutions and give the general exact oscillating solution in terms of the elliptic functions which has not been studied before .",
    "also , we discuss a possibility to get very deep oscillations ( i.e. those which can reach very high density to allow at least some standard hot universe processes ) and to reduce the amount of exotic matter in form of wall - like - matter . in section 3",
    "we present the exact elementary non - oscillatory solutions which complete the discussion of section 2 . in section 3",
    "we give an alternative scalar field interpretation for exotic fluids necessary to force the universe to oscillate .",
    "we choose a very simple model of the scalar fields of which potential and kinetic energy are proportional , following the discussion of barrow and saich @xcite . for a monotonic solution and the oscillating kardashev s solution we present exact scalar fields and their potentials .",
    "it appears that for oscillating solutions for the scale factor the potentials are also periodic in the scalar fields . in section 5",
    "we comment on the results .",
    "following our earlier discussion of exact analytic solutions of the friedman equation @xcite we generalize it to the case when other negative pressure fluids are present , in particular wall - like - matter whose energy density scales as @xmath3 ( r is the scale factor ) @xcite .",
    "the friedman equation has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the conformal time defined by the cosmic time as @xmath6 and @xmath7 , k is the curvature index , and the constants @xmath8 are constants responsible for the density of radiation , nonrelativistic matter , string - like - matter ( whose energy density scales as @xmath9 ) and wall - like - matter respectively , and @xmath10 is the cosmological constant . the friedman equation ( 2.1 ) in terms of the so - called reduced blackbody temperature is proportional to the temperature of the microwave background if @xmath11 , and it is only interpreted as an inverse function of @xmath12 if @xmath13 @xcite ] @xmath14 where @xmath15 is @xcite @xmath16 where the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 is responsible for the density of wall - like - matter ( @xmath18 ) . in order to make qualitative analysis of the solutions of ( 2.5 ) we use the method of the associated mechanical system @xcite .",
    "in fact ( 2.5 ) can be considered as the energy equation of a one - dimensional mechanical system with @xmath19 as a coordinate , the kinetic energy @xmath20 , the potential @xmath21 where @xmath22 and the total energy @xmath23 .",
    "the general shape of the potential ( 2.7 ) depends on the values of the factors @xmath24 and @xmath25 . instead of the full discussion of the solutions ( 2.5 ) we will concentrate on special cases which allow the universe to oscillate in time between the two fixed values of the scale factor @xmath12 ( or @xmath26 ) @xcite .",
    "in order to have oscillations at least two kinds of matter are necessary i.e. the cosmological constant and the wall - like - matter . to make our considerations easier we put @xmath13 ( no radiation ) which we will call @xmath27 and @xmath28 have to fulfil the conditions @xmath29 it follows from these relations that there should be at least one negative real root and the two real or complex conjugate roots , which means that radiation pressure can only change the left branch of the curve of the potential @xmath30 ( i.e. negative @xmath26 - cf .",
    "figs.1 - 3 ) which is not physically relevant . ]",
    "the potential ( 2.7 ) is then @xmath31 and it has one double root @xmath32 for @xmath33 and two real roots for @xmath34 as well as the root at @xmath35 .",
    "its corresponding extrema are a double one at @xmath36 for @xmath37 ( which is an inflection point as well ) and two real ones for @xmath38 .",

    "having the exact shape of the potential ( 2.7 ) ( figs.1 - 3 ) we cut the curves along the constant @xmath46 lines .",
    "the point associated with the universe can only move in the upper part of the plane and we look for the possible solutions .",
    "we consider only the particular cases given by ( 2.13 ) where oscillations are possible ( @xmath48 zeros and @xmath49 extrema of ( 2.9 ) ) .",
    "these are :    a. if @xmath50 and @xmath51 we have @xmath52 and the oscillations corresponding to a constant @xmath46 lines for @xmath53 with @xmath54 given by ( 2.16 ) are possible in the central well of the potential ( 2.9 ) ( fig.1 ) .",

    "there is apparently a double extremum for @xmath62 if @xmath63 , but it is also an inflection point of ( 2.9 ) and this case does not allow any oscillating solutions at all .    in all considered cases @xmath64 the discriminant ( 2.15 )",
    "is positive and the fundamental periodicity cell is a rectangle ( fig.4 ) @xcite .",
    "the roots @xmath65 of the equation @xmath66 are all real and since @xmath67 , at least one of them must be negative .",

    "the roots are given by the relations @xmath70 and @xmath71 however , since we consider the solutions of the equation for @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "( 2.5 ) ) then we should define the roots of the equation @xmath72 which are @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 refers to a minimum of @xmath26 , i.e. a maximum of @xmath12 for the recollapsing model associated with ( 2.13 ) and @xmath76 refer to a minimum and a maximum of @xmath26 for the oscillating model associated with ( 2.13 ) . from ( 2.19 )",
    "we conclude that @xmath76 and @xmath75 must be real and positive since @xmath77 and @xmath78 and @xmath46 is negative in the cases @xmath64 .",
    "the general oscillatory solution for all the cases @xmath64 can be expressed in terms of the weierstrass @xmath79 function @xcite @xmath80    , \\ ] ] and the expression for the cosmic time , from ( 2.2 ) , is @xmath81 + \\ln \\frac{\\sigma(\\tau_{d } - \\tau ) } { \\sigma(\\tau_{d } + \\tau ) }    , \\ ] ] so for @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( fig.6 ) . in both formulas ( 2.21 ) and ( 2.22 ) the conformal time is real but the zeros of the function @xmath26 , namely @xmath85 and @xmath86 are imaginary .",
    "also , @xmath46 in these expressions should be taken negative according to the general results of the existance of the oscillatory solutions and then @xmath87 and @xmath88 are imaginary .",
    "the periods are given by @xcite @xmath89 so @xmath68 is pure real and @xmath69 is pure imaginary .",
    "let us now consider another type of the exact oscillating universes , the ones in which there is no dust ( i.e. @xmath90 in ( 2.1 ) and @xmath13 ) . because of the definition ( 2.4 ) we can not now use the relation ( 2.3 ) to work out the limit @xmath91 from ( 2.5 ) .",
    "instead we use the method by putting @xmath92 so ( 2.1 ) becomes @xmath93 the potential analogous to ( 2.7 ) now is ( fig.7 ) @xmath94 and provided @xmath50 we have oscillations for @xmath95 . in this case",
    "the solution is elementary and oscillating @xcite . after a deparametrization based on ( 2.2 ) the exact solution",

    "one can conclude that for cf .",

    "@xmath101 the universe will oscillate between the fixed extrema of @xmath12 and the smallest admissible value of the scale factor will be slightly larger than ( cf .",
    "section 3 ) @xmath102 so the mass density of nonrelativistic matter will be @xcite @xmath103 if we assume @xmath104 ( only @xmath105 is possible here , since @xmath50 ) which means that the amount of string - like - matter is small and most of the exotic matter is in the form of wall - like - matter , then from ( 2.28 ) @xmath106 in order to calculate @xmath107 ( with the dimension [ cm ] ) we should apply the conservation law ( 2.28 ) . for the maximum density at the nucleosynthesis scale @xmath108 we need @xmath109 which can be achieved for instance either for the present nonrelativistic matter mass density @xmath110 ( rather tiny ) and the present radius @xmath111 light years or for the present mass density @xmath112 ( larger ) and the smaller present radius @xmath113 light years .",
    "however , for the maximum density at recombination scale @xmath114 we need @xmath115 and it requires for example the present nonrelativistic matter density @xmath116 and the present radius @xmath111 light years which is quite realistic .",
    "this means that oscillations might allow at least some standard early universe processes like nucleosynthesis or recombination .",
    "the amount of wall - like - matter can be reduced if we lessen the value of @xmath7 ( i.e. decrease the appropriate value of @xmath107 - cf.(2.28 ) ) , since the density of walls is proportional to @xmath117 @xmath118 and the wall - like - matter is replaced by string - like - matter ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "however , in such a case both the maximum and minimum of the potential ( 2.7 ) are approaching zero - the well becomes smaller which means that the appropriate periods of oscillations are smaller .",
    "since the amplitude of oscillations corresponds to the length of the @xmath120 const .",
    "lines contained inside the well of the potential ( 2.7 ) ( figs.1 - 3 ) one can easily notice a very interesting feature of the models a and b. it is that the closer to zero ( necessarily negative ) value of the cosmological constant @xmath46 , the bigger the maximum , and the smaller the minimum size of the universe can be , which means the longer period of oscillations . on the other hand , since we do not experience small period of oscillations ( they can appear for large negative @xmath46 - figs.1 - 3 ) we could obtain some restrictions on the possible value of the cosmological constant in these models .    finally , it is very interesting to mention that if we admit some fractional equations of state @xmath121 with @xmath122 ( n is non - integer ) to derive the new friedman equation different from ( 2.1 ) , then a larger variety of possibilities for oscillations appear @xcite .",
    "it can be explained in terms of the associated mechanical system simply because more wells of the potential are possible in which the universe can oscillate .",
    "such fractional equations of state are possible since the exotic matter may have an effective equation of state anywhere in a range between well established values .",
    "for instance for strings @xmath123 and for walls @xmath124 depending on their velocities @xcite .",
    "in this section we concentrate on some particular solutions given by elementary functions .",
    "none of them is oscillatory but they complete the discussion of the solutions from the cases @xmath64 as far as they can give some insight into the nature of the oscillatory solutions as well .    generally , if the discriminant ( 2.14 ) vanishes the solution is elementary . from ( 2.15 ) one can realize that it happens for @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath61 given by ( 2.16 ) . with the condition of the vanishing discriminant the equation ( 2.5 ) factorizes to the form @xmath127 with @xmath128 with @xmath129 const . with @xmath49 given by ( 3.2 ) we have two einstein static universes in the cases @xmath130 and @xmath131 ( figs.1 and 3 ) .",
    "one of them should be stable because it lies at the bottom of the well of the potential ( 2.7 ) . in the case",
    "b i.e. for @xmath55 ( 3.2 ) reduces to @xmath132 with every stable solution for @xmath133 it is also associated the elementary recollapsing solution for @xmath126 . on the other hand with each unstable solution for @xmath134 there",
    "are also associated two asymptotic solutions for @xmath126 .",
    "since the types of the elementary solutions of ( 3.1 ) in the cases @xmath130 and @xmath131 are analogous to the solutions in the case @xmath135 with only numerical difference between ( 3.2 ) and ( 3.3 ) we will be discussing the latter case which is mathematically simpler .",
    "the stable einstein static universe appears for @xmath136 and @xmath137 the equation ( 3.1 ) for @xmath126 reads as @xmath138 and its solution for @xmath139 describes the evolution of the closed universe from the big - bang to the big - crunch in the form @xmath140 }     .\\ ] ] the unstable einstein static universe appears for @xmath141 and @xmath142 the equation ( 3.1 ) for @xmath141 reads as @xmath143 there are two asymptotic to ( 3.7 ) solutions of ( 3.8 )",

    "in this section we try to give an alternative interpretation for exotic matter appearing in the friedman equation ( 2.1 ) in terms of the scalar fields and appropriate potentials .",
    "the motivation is that we still are looking for the new candidates for the dark matter in cosmology and we may think about scalar fields existing at the present era of the evolution as good candidates .",
    "such an interpretation seems to give more freedom in imposing the observational constraints than string - like - matter and wall - like - matter @xcite .",
    "our procedure is a reverse of the standard procedure dealing with scalar fields . instead of starting with an explicit potential to derive the equation of state ,",
    "we start with the equations of state for string - like - matter and wall - like - matter ( cf . section 2 , formula ( 2.1 ) ) in order to derive the exact potentials @xcite .",
    "the energy density and pressure for two mutually noninteracting scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity can be written as @xmath150 where i = 1,2 .",
    "if , apart from this , we admit a barotropic fluid with the equation of state @xmath151 we will obtain the rewritten friedman equation ( 2.1 ) in the form @xcite @xmath152 and the wave equations for both fields @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 . following barrow and saich ( 1993 ) we assume a simple hypothesis that kinetic and potential energies of the @xmath156 fields are proportional ,",
    "so @xmath157 with @xmath158 const .. if we use the conformal time ( 2.2 ) then we can write down the solutions of ( 4.4)-(4.5 ) under the conditions ( 4.6)-(4.7 ) in the following way @xmath159 where @xmath160 are constants of integration . the rewritten friedman equation ( 2.1 )",

    "these results together with ( 4.18 ) and ( 4.19 ) may suggest that at least under the assumption of proportionality of kinetic and potential energies ( 4.6)-(4.7 ) the monotonic type of the solution for the scale factor @xmath200 leads to the monotonic dependence of the potential @xmath201 on the scalar field @xmath202 and the oscillating type of solution for @xmath200 leads to the oscillating dependence of the potential @xmath201 on the scalar field @xmath202 .",
    "in this paper we discussed a class of nonsingular oscillatory universes following kardashev s @xcite discussion of admitting essential fraction of stable domain walls as the exotic matter and the negative cosmological constant . in the context of the dark non - baryonic matter problem both kinds of fluids can serve as dark matter candidates .",
    "the former acts as a source of repulsive gravity but the latter acts as a source of attraction .",
    "the balance between these two sources allows the universe to fall into oscillations .",
    "in fact , this is very similar situation to the case of the einstein static universe , where there is a balance between nonrelativistic positive pressure matter and repulsive positive cosmological constant . according to our analysis",
    "the einstein static models exist as a result of a balance between the exotic matter and the attractive negative cosmological constant . unlike the original einstein static universe these models seem to be mechanically stable as they lie at the bottom of the asociated mechanical potential ( 2.7 ) , but",
    "their stability should be examined more carefully .",
    "since the value of the negative cosmological constant can be reduced to be very close to zero for oscillatory solutions ( cf . section 2 ) , the most severe problem of possible compatibility with observations refers to exotic matter , especially to domain walls @xcite . because of that we proposed a replacement of the exotic matter by scalar fields which may serve as dark matter candidates as well .",
    "we inversed the standard procedure - first we had the equation of state and then we derived exact potentials @xcite .",
    "the potentials we studied seem to keep the same properties as the solutions for the scale factors .",
    "it means that monotonic solutions for @xmath200 ( cf.(3.9 ) ) give monotonic potentials ( cf.(4.18)-(4.19 ) ) and oscillatory solutions ( cf.(2.26 ) ) give oscillatory potentials ( cf.(4.27)-(4.28 ) ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the paper is based on many simplifications and the question is what are the properties of oscillatory solutions in more physically realistic situations .",
    "firstly , in the discussion of oscillatory solutions of section 2 we have neither considered any non - isotropic geometry nor non - isotropic fluid description for instance for string - like - matter and wall - like - matter .",
    "secondly , in the scalar fields interpretation of section 4 we have assumed a very simple proportionality relation for the kinetic and potential energies , the minimal coupling of the fields to gravity and the lack of interaction between them .",
    "of course all these assumptions might not necessarily apply and the validity of the presented results should be considered towards these points .",
    "especially , in future work one can consider some non - isotropic cosmologies @xcite and non - minimally coupled fields @xcite , but these approaches will certainly be much more difficult to treat analitycally . also , one can discuss oscillating quasi - static universes in the context of the maximum entropy analysis given by gibbons @xcite .",
    "finally , we should mention one common feature of our results with the results of petry @xcite in his conformal gravity theory .",
    "namely , in both theories nonsingular oscillating solutions appear for the negative cosmological constant .",
    "how far this results could be true for other gravity theories is a matter for further consideration .",
