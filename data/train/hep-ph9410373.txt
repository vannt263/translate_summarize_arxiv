    "it has been known that there is a specific angle at which the angular distribution of the process @xmath0 in lowest order vanishes , so called the radiation amplitude zero ( raz ) phenomenon , if the magnetic moment of the w has the standard model ( sm ) value @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is a consequence of the factorization property of the four particle scattering amplitude @xcite . for any gauge theory , the internal symmetry ( charge ) dependence and the polarization ( spin ) dependence of the scattering amplitude",
    "can be factorized into separate parts at tree level if one or more of the four particles are massless gauge bosons .",
    "such a characteristic phenomenon may provide a test for the magnetic moments of the w@xcite and the charge of quarks@xcite .",
    "the raz has been studied in a number of processes in the standard model and it has also been investigated for processes with charged higgs bosons in extensions of the standard model , such as @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 are squarks with charges @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively ) @xcite .    depending on the particle contents in the model , there are different processes which exhibit raz phenomena .",
    "the particle contents of the minimal standard @xmath8 model are : ( 1 ) gauge particles : gluon which transforms as * 8 * under @xmath9 and does not transform under @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 which are the gauge particles of @xmath10 .",
    "( 2 ) the higgs particle @xmath14 which transforms under the sm group as ( 1 , 2 , 1 ) . ( 3 ) the fermions : they are left - handed quarks @xmath15 , right - handed up - type quarks @xmath16 and down - type quarks @xmath17 , left - handed leptons @xmath18 , and right - handed charged leptons @xmath19 .",
    "their transformation properties under the sm group are : @xmath20 in this model , the factorization property exists in the processes @xmath0 and @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "if the model is extended to include two or more higgs doublets , like the supersymmetric sm , charged higgs particles @xmath22 exist .",
    "many theories suggest the existence of new particles .",
    "for example , in superstring - inspired @xmath23 models@xcite , leptoquarks which couple to a lepton - quark pair naturally appear as the supersymmetric partner of the exotic colored particle which lies in the * 27 * representation of @xmath23 .",
    "these particles are bosons with fractional charges and color triplets .",
    "there are also many particles which can couple to standard fermions directly at tree level . with new particles there are more processes which exhibit the raz phenomenon .",
    "it is interesting to study the raz in all these processes . in table",
    "i , we list all the scalar particles which can couple to the standard fermions at the tree level .",
    "if some of the new particles in table i are not too heavy , they may be produced in collider experiments .",
    "the scalar leptoquark production in hadron colliders or ep colliders has been studied in many papers@xcite .",
    "the discovery limits depend on the strength of the yukawa couplings @xmath24 .",
    "for example , it was shown that the discovery limits for pair production of scalar leptoquarks are @xmath25 gev at the fermilab tevatron , and the limits for single production are model - dependent@xcite . in particular , an ep collider may be considered as an ideal machine to search for leptoquarks . at hera ( scalar ) leptoquarks with masses as heavy as 200 gev can be discovered even in the case of couplings as small as 0.01@xcite .",
    "thus , it may be possible , for instance at hera , to detect the raz in the decays of scalar leptoquarks with relatively heavy masses if the couplings are not too small .    in this paper",
    ", we study the raz phenomena in decay processes with a photon or a gluon emission of all possible scalar particles that can couple to the standard fermions at the tree level .",
    "we study these raz in a model - independent way .",
    "we assume the existence of these particles and find the properties related to the raz .",
    "the results can be easily applied to a specific model .",
    "we present in sec.ii the radiative decay cases along with a photon emission and in sec.iii the cases along with a gluon emission . in sec.iv",
    "our conclusions are summarized .",
    "the most general coupling of a scalar s to fermions @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be parametrized as @xmath28 where a and b are model - dependent coupling parameters .",
    "to lowest order , there are three diagrams ( fig.1 ) which contribute to the radiative decay @xmath29 the decay amplitude is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the amplitudes corresponding to ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of fig.1 , respectively . as mentioned before , there is a factorization property in the decay amplitude @xmath33 because a massless gauge particle @xmath13 appears in the processes .",
    "indeed the decay amplitude can be written in the factorized form as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the electric charges of @xmath37 and @xmath26 , respectively , and @xmath38 is the polarization vector of the photon .",

    "in this section we study the raz phenomena in scalar particle decay processes with the emission of a gluon .",
    "we shall find in this case that a zero does not appear in the differential decay rate , while the amplitude clearly shows the factorization property and reveals the color charge - dependent factor which is responsible for the zero .",
    "the reason is as follows : when we calculate the differential decay rate from the given amplitude , we should sum over all color indices of the final particles , because we can not detect each color state in experiment .",
    "the summation over all color indices of the product particles washes away the zero which at least formally appears in the amplitude .",
    "now , we investigate this phenomenon specifically . as we can see in table i , only three types of decay processes may be possible : @xmath9 triplet- , sextet- , and octet - type .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the scalar particles to quarks can be written as follows .",
    "+ @xmath9 triplet case :  ( @xmath63 ) @xmath64 @xmath9 sextet case :  ( @xmath65 ) @xmath66 @xmath9 octet case :  ( @xmath67 ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the yukawa couplings for triplet , sextet and octet case , respectively . @xmath72 and",
    "@xmath73 may denote the different quark flavors each other .",
    "the indices @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 correspond to the quark color and run from 1 to 3 , and @xmath43 corresponds to the gluon color and runs from 1 to 8 .",
    "@xmath77 is the @xmath78 component of @xmath9 color matrices @xmath79 satisfying @xmath80 = i f_{abc } t^c \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 are the antisymmetric @xmath9 structure constants . here",
    "the summation over the repeated indices are assumed .",
    "we consider the three - body decays of the scalar particles defined by eqs.([triplet ] ) , ( [ sextet ] ) and ( [ octet ] ) into a quark - antiquark pair ( or two antiquarks ) and a gluon .",
    "the feynman graphs for the triplet case are shown in fig.7 .",
    "for the sextet and the octet cases the feynman graphs are similar , except that the decaying scalars have different structure of indices such as @xmath82 for the sextet and @xmath83 for the octet .",
    "the amplitudes in each case have the same form except for ` the color charge - dependent factor ' as follows : @xmath84 where @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath85 or @xmath86 or @xmath87 in each case and in the octet case @xmath88 is replaced by @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath90 is the polarization vector of gluon and @xmath91 is the one defined by eq.([pi2 ] ) .",
    "the color charge - dependent factors are given by @xmath92    as we have mentioned , the amplitudes clearly reveal the factorization property and the color charge - dependent factors are responsible for the raz . however , to obtain the differential decay rates , we should sum over all color indices of the final particles .",
    "for example , in the case of an @xmath9 triplet scalar decay , the color charge - dependent factor which is now multipled by the complex conjugate of itself and summed over all color indices gives : @xmath93 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & { 128 \\over { 3 m^4 x^2 } } { { y^2 + 3 } \\over ( 1 - y^2)^2 } \\ ; , \\label{sum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath94 run from 1 to 3 and @xmath43 runs form 1 to 8 , and we have used the variables @xmath95 and @xmath96 defined by eqs.([x ] ) and ( [ y ] ) .",
    "we note that comparing eq.([m5 ] ) with eq.([m2 ] ) , the differential decay rates obtained from the amplitudes of eq.([m5 ] ) have the same form as eq.([gamma ] ) , except for the color charge - dependent factors multiplied by the complex conjugates of themselves and summed over all color indices , such as eq.([sum ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath97 , it is obvious that no raz occurs in this case .",
    "the cases of an @xmath9 sextet and an octet scalar decay show the same phenomena .",
    "explicitly , after being multiplied by the complex conjugates of themselves and summing over all color indices , the color charge - dependent factors give : @xmath98 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "fig.8 shows the characteristic curve of the function @xmath101 with @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the minimum of the function occurs at @xmath104 , independent of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , we find that in the cases of the decay along with the emission of a gluon , even though the raz s are washed away , the differential decay rates have the characteristic property  the plot of the differential decay rates",
    "versus @xmath96 behaves like the curve of @xmath105 with constants @xmath106 and so has the minimum only at @xmath104 which is independent of @xmath95 , the particle masses and the various couplings .",
    "we have studied the amplitude zeros in the radiative decay processes ( along with the emission of a photon or a gluon ) for all possible scalar particles which may interact with the standard fermions at the tree level . for the decays with a photon emission",
    ", we have shown that the amplitudes exhibit the expected factorization property and the differential decay rates in the variables @xmath95 and @xmath96 vanish at @xmath107 which is independent of @xmath95 , the particle masses and the various couplings @xmath24 .",
    "the branching ratios versus various leptoquark masses were calculated and ploted for the scalar leptoquark decays .    for the decays with a gluon emission , we have found that even though the raz s are washed away , the differential decay rates still have the characteristic property that there is a minimum at @xmath104 independent of @xmath95 , the particle masses and the various couplings .",
