    "simple runge - kutta methods can be performed in the case of a local potential , and discretization of the integration domain can be used for a non - local interaction @xcite .",
    "all these techniques can be used because the kinetic energy operator can be expressed in terms of a derivative operator .",
    "this is no longer true in the case of a spinless salpeter equation for which the kinetic energy is a complicated square - root operator .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "we have developed a method to compute the eigenvalues of a spinless salpeter equation .",
    "this method relies on the fact that the kinetic energy operator is best represented in momentum space , while the potential energy is generally given in coordinate space .",
    "it requires only the evaluation of the potential at equally spaced grid points , and yields directly the amplitude of the solution at the same grid points .",
    "this method is derived from the fourier grid hamiltonian method @xcite developed to compute the solution of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation , and consequently was called the 3-dimensional fourier grid hamiltonian method .",

    ", we show that 3-dimensional fourier grid hamiltonian method can be used to compute the scattering solutions of a spinless salpeter equation ( or a schrdinger equation ) .",

    "we assume that the hamiltonian can be written as the sum of the kinetic energy @xmath0 and a potential energy operator @xmath1 .",
    "the scattering equation is given by @xmath2 |\\psi \\rangle = e |\\psi \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath0 depends only on the square of the relative impulsion @xmath3 between the particles , @xmath1 is a local interaction which depends on the relative distance , and @xmath4 is the asymptotic kinetic energy of the two interacting particles .",
    "this equation is a spinless salpeter equation if @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the masses of the particles ( we use the natural units @xmath8 throughout the text ) .",

    "the relative energy @xmath4 is then equal to @xmath19 in the case of a spinless salpeter equation , and is equal to @xmath20 in the case of a schrdinger equation .      in order to compute the scattering solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqrad ] ) , we replace the continuous variable @xmath21 by a grid of discrete values @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the uniform spacing between the grid points .",

    "we choose to set arbitrarily @xmath29 in order to fix the normalization of the wave function .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spacing @xmath24 in the configuration space determines the grid spacing @xmath30 in the momentum space .",

    "the phase shift can be computed by using the values of the wave function at two points in the region where the potential is vanishing @xcite .",

    "other normalization problems appear for all values of angular momentum .",

    "as noted above , solutions of the non - relativistic and semi - relativistic free eq .",
    "( [ eqrad ] ) can be expressed in terms of spherical bessel functions .",
    "it can be easily shown that the vector @xmath56 , up to a normalization constant , is a solution of the system ( [ mat : a ] ) for @xmath45 if @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "this vector is no longer a solution if @xmath18 is not a integer multiple of @xmath59 . in this case",
    "the computed solution matches the solution of the continuous eq .",

    "this situation is illustrated with fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] for the semi - relativistic free equation .",
    "the regularized radial part of the computed solution for a given energy is presented for the same value of the spacing , but for different values of @xmath60 .",
    "the relative kinetic energy being fixed , different values of @xmath60 correspond to different values for the parameter @xmath61 .",
    "we can show on this figure that the computed solutions differ from the exact solution when @xmath61 is not an integer .",
    "the situation is not modified by a change of the energy .",
    "if the angular momentum @xmath44 is different from zero , then the vector @xmath62 is not an exact solution of the system ( [ mat : a ] ) or ( [ mat : b ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , a very good approximation of the continuous free solution can be obtained with correct values for the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath60 . again , the computed and the exact solutions can differ strongly near the last point @xmath60 .",
    "it is worth noting that the differences between the computed and the exact solutions are much less large in the non - relativistic case , whatever the value of @xmath44 .    in the free case",
    ", the phase shift is expected to be zero .",
    "numerically , the phase shift can be determined by using two points of the computed solution .",
    "if these points are chosen in the region near @xmath60 , the phase shift found can be different from zero . on the contrary , when the two points are taken far from @xmath60 , the phase shift value vanishes .",
    "we have tested our method with different finite range potentials in the case of symmetric or asymmetric systems . in this section",
    ", we shall only present some results obtained with a gaussian potential @xmath63 for two identical particles @xmath64 .    in the free case , the computed solution can differ strongly from the real solution near the last point @xmath60 .",
    "this is also the case when a potential is turned on .",
    "the phase shift can be computed with two values of the numerical solution evaluated at two different points @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "if @xmath67 or @xmath68 is too close to @xmath43 , then the value of the phase shift can be very bad .",
    "obviously , the two points must be taken in a region where the potential can be neglected with respect to the relative kinetic energy . a good procedure to get reliable phase shift is to compute the wave function with a large value of @xmath60 .",
    "then , the phase shift can be computed with two adjacent points @xmath65 and @xmath69 as a function of the index @xmath67 . by decreasing the value of @xmath67 from @xmath43 , the phase shifts will first strongly vary and rapidly reach a stable value , as long as @xmath65 is large enough to not fall in a region where the potential can not be neglected",
    "this situation is illustrated with fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] . on this figure ,",
    "the phase shift for two identical semi - relativistic particles with @xmath70 gev is plotted as a function of @xmath65 for two values of the relative energy and for two values of @xmath60 .",
    "the gaussian potential is characterized by @xmath71 gev and @xmath72 gev@xmath73 .",
    "it is worth noting that the variation of the phase shifts are much larger for the semi - relativistic case than for the non - relativistic case .",
    "scattering states have been calculated with our method for two non - relativistic particles interacting with a gaussian potential . in this case ,",
    "wave functions and phases shifts can also be computed with a great variety of methods . for a large range of relative energy and for angular momentum varying from 0 to 4 , we have checked that all approaches give same results . within our method ,",
    "a relative accuracy of at least @xmath74 for phase shifts can be obtained with a grid containing 200400 points . obviously , the interest of our method is to compute scattering solutions in the semi - relativistic case .",
    "it is shown in the appendix that a spinless salpeter equation with a particular separable non - local potential can be transformed into a schrdinger - like non - local equation . in this case",
    ", the scattering semi - relativistic equation can be solved directly by the fourier grid hamiltonian method , or using the equivalent schrdinger - like form , by usual techniques .",
    "we have verified , for several values of the parameters and for different values of the relative kinetic energy , that all methods give the same results .",
    "this yields a direct verification of our approach .    finally , we give , in table  [ tab:1 ] , the phase shifts for two identical particles interacting via a gaussian potential as a function of the relative kinetic energy .",
    "results have been computed for a non - relativistic and a semi - relativistic kinematics , and for two values of the angular momentum @xmath44 .",
    "as expected , phase shifts are similar for low relative energy , and differ when energy increases .",
    "the 3-dimensional fourier grid hamiltonian method , used in a previous work to compute bound states @xcite , appears as a convenient method to find the scattering solutions of a spinless salpeter equation ( or a schrdinger equation ) .",
    "it has the advantage of simplicity since it requires only the evaluation of the potential at some grid points and it generates directly the values of the radial part of the wave function at the same grid points .",
    "moreover , the method can be extended to the cases of non - local interaction or coupled channel equations . up to our knowledge , this is the first time that the scattering solutions of the spinless salpeter equation are presented .",
    "meson - meson scattering has been recently investigated in terms of quark degrees of freedom within the framework of the non - relativistic resonating group method @xcite . from this work",
    ", it appears that the use of a semi - relativistic kinematics is necessary to avoid inconsistencies related to the non - relativistic formalism .",
    "we have calculated a semi - relativistic version of the pion - pion scattering equation .",
    "this equation is a scattering spinless salpeter equation . in this framework",
    ", the method presented here appears suitable to calculate the corresponding phase shifts @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the solutions of the numerical method presented here can easily be controlled since it depends only on two parameters : the number of grid points and the largest value of the radial distance considered to perform the calculation .",
    "this distance must be large enough to fall in the region where the potential can be neglected with respect to the asymptotic kinetic energy .",
    "both parameters can be automatically increased until a convergence is reached for phase shifts .",
    "the method involves the use of matrices of order @xmath75 , where @xmath43 is the number of grid points .",
    "generally , the most time consuming part of the method is the solution of the linear system .",
    "this is not a problem for modern computers , even for pc stations .",
    "moreover , several powerful techniques exist and can be used at the best convenience .",
