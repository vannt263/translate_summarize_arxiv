    "this study focuses on hnc , a common high density gas tracer in the ism . at low temperatures , hnc forms efficiently together with hcn through ion - molecule reactions .",
    "hnc and hcn are observed in a variety of different sources , but their relative abundances can vary by more than order of magnitude , which has been related to the physical environment where the emission originates . in pre - stellar and protostellar environments ,",
    "the observed hnc / hcn abundance ratio is @xmath01 at 10 k and decreases as temperature increases ( e.g.  @xcite ) , suggesting that thermal reaction barriers play an important role in controlling this ratio .",
    "work by @xcite has shown that the hnc / hcn ratio also depends on the elemental abundances of carbon at low temperatures , due to destructive reactions with atomic carbon . in less shielded regions ,",
    "the hnc / hcn ratio also depends on the radiation present @xcite .",
    "nearby , protoplanetary disks , such as the one surrounding tw hya , provide an interesting test bed for evaluating the relative impact of different environmental parameters on the hnc chemistry , due to their relatively well characterized geometries and density , temperature and radiation structures .",
    "the hnc distribution in disks is interesting in its own right .",
    "hnc and hcn are two of very few nitrogen - bearing molecules detected toward disks @xcite and their distributions may therefore provide some of the best available constraints on the nitrogen reservoir . cyanides and iso - cyanides",

    "has proven challenging , however .",
    "the intrinsic disk scales are small and the molecular line fluxes are weak compared to interstellar clouds and protostars . to date , hnc has only been detected in a single disk , dm tau , @xcite and no spatially resolved observations exist .    in this letter , we report the first interferometric detection of hnc in two disks , around the t tauri star tw hya ( d = 54 pc @xcite ) and herbig ae star hd 163296 ( d = 122 pc , @xcite ) , using the sma .",

    "we set the hnc boundaries using the values from @xcite for hcn ( log@xmath24=-0.5 , log@xmath25=1.5 ) .",
    "the radial distribution of hnc was modeled using an abundance power - law with an outer radius ( r@xmath29 ) , hole radius ( r@xmath30 ) , and power - law index of -1.5 .",

    "this model results in no significant residuals when subtracted from the data in the ( @xmath19)-plane and then imaged .",

    "in this study , we detect and spatially resolve hnc emission toward tw hya and hd 163296 . from these observations we extracted disk averaged hnc / hcn emission ratios , and the inner and outer hnc emission radii in the tw hya disk . here",
    ", we will discuss the constraints that these observations provide on the hnc chemistry and the disk structure .",
    "the disk - averaged hnc / hcn emission ratio is 0.1  0.2 toward both tw hya and hd 163296 .",
    "based on ism observations @xcite and astrochemistry models @xcite , the hnc / hcn ratio can be used to constrain the characteristic temperature of the emission region because of efficient destruction of hnc by hydrogen atoms at temperatures @xmath3225  k. however , to apply this result straightforwardly requires that hnc and hcn are co - spatial , that there is a simple relationship between emission and abundance ratios of hnc and hcn , and that temperature dominates the chemistry , none of which clearly hold in the case of these disks .",
    "first , hnc and hcn are not co - spatial ",
    "some hcn is present toward the center of the disk , where hnc is absent .",
    "this may be partially mitigated by averaging the hnc and hcn emission only across disk areas where hcn and hnc emission are respectively detected .",
    "second , the relationship between line emission and abundance ratios is complicated by high hcn line opacities and different hcn and hnc excitation properties @xcite .",
    "we used the large velocity gradient radiative transfer code , radex @xcite , with the collisional rate constants from @xcite to evaluate relationship between the hnc / hcn line emission and abundance ratios using temperatures and densities characteristic of hcn disk emission @xcite and the hcn column density from @xcite .",
    "we find that the line and abundance ratios can differ by up to an order of magnitude , demonstrating that more detailed modeling is required to extract hnc / hcn abundance ratios from the observed line emission .",
    "even if abundance ratios are successfully extracted , it may be difficult to infer a characteristic emission region temperature .",
    "other environmental characteristics than temperature may regulate the hnc / hcn abundance ratio in disks .",
    "the model by @xcite neglects the influence of radiation , which is reasonable in cloud cores , but may not be a good approximation in disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite has also shown that the hnc / hcn ratio depends on the c / o ratio , which may be elevated in disks . in the absence of detailed disk chemistry models that incorporate the complete hnc / hcn chemistry ,",
    "disk - averaged line ratios are thus not useful probes of disk properties .      in the disk toward tw hya ,",
    "there is a lack of hnc emission interior to 2845  au , corresponding to temperatures above 2113  k using the @xcite temperature profile .",
    "hcn does not have an emission hole @xcite .",
    "the observed absence of hnc close to the star is consistent with temperature dependent hnc destruction @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to explain the hole with the increased uv flux present at smaller radii , since hnc and hcn are thought to have similar photodissociation cross - sections @xcite .",
    "hnc also has an outer emission radius between 3555 au , with the best fit at 45 au , substantially smaller than the observed radii of other gases , including co , hco@xmath33 and hcn @xcite .",
    "this outer cutoff in hnc emission was unexpected .",
    "it coincides with the onset of c@xmath34h emission , which is proposed to be a uv photochemistry product @xcite , and is close to the radius where the dust density sharply decreases @xcite .",
    "these spatial coincidences suggest three potential explanations for the outer cutoff of hnc emission : 1 .",
    "uv photodissociation of hnc due to deeper penetration of stellar and interstellar uv photons in the low - column density outer disk , 2 .",
    "an increased uv photodissociation of h@xmath34 and carbon - bearing molecules accelerating the hnc+h and hnc+c destruction processes at a given temperature @xcite , and 3 .",
    "grain - gas thermal decoupling due to lower gas and grain densities , causing a temperature reversal in the outer disk and thus the increase in thermally controlled hnc destruction ( i.e. a similar process that sets the inner edge ) .",
    "the first two explanations both depend on a more efficient uv photochemistry exterior to 45  au , consistent with the onset of c@xmath34h emission at the same radius @xcite , and signs of efficient uv photochemistry in the outer low - density regions of other disks @xcite . flared disks can intercept stellar uv radiation out to larger radii , and ly@xmath35 emission is efficiently down - scattered through disk towards the midplane @xcite .",
    "additionally , the interstellar radiation field will contribute a non - negligible amount of uv radiation to the outer disk @xcite .",
    "efficient uv penetration at large disk radii may increase the hnc photodissociation rate , reducing its abundance .",
    "this scenario could be tested by comparing hnc and hcn emission profiles .",
    "hnc and hcn are believed to have similar photodissociation cross - sections @xcite , and if their outer emission radii are uv controlled , they should be the same .",
    "the best - fit outer hcn emission radius is @xmath0100  au @xcite , twice that of hnc , but this value is not well enough constrained to exclude direct photodissociation of hnc as an explanation for the hnc outer radius .",
    "the second and third proposed explanations for the hnc outer cut - off should produce a smaller hnc than hcn emission radius , due to an increased hnc - to - hcn conversion rate in the outer disk . in the second scenario and increased uv penetration increases the atomic h and c abundance through h@xmath34 and co photodissociation @xcite , speeding up hnc isomerization at a given temperature @xcite . in the third scenario , a lower density in the outer disk",
    "reduces gas - grain thermal coupling sufficiently that direct gas heating by the interstellar radiation field becomes important .",
    "this heating could result in a radial temperature gradient reversal outside of 45  au , again increasing the hnc isomerization rate .",
    "higher spatial resolution observations with alma should be able to distinguish between the three scenarios .",
    "the relative sizes of the hnc and hcn outer radii should differentiate between # 1 on one hand and # 2 and # 3 on the other . if # 1 is ruled out , the radial temperature profile of hcn beyond 45  au should be able to differentiate between # 2 and # 3 .",
    "whichever scenario is confirmed , spatially resolved hnc / hcn emission modeled using non - lte techniques clearly has a large potential to probe interesting disk properties .",
    "this work has benefited from discussions with sean andrews , david wilner , ryan loomis , eric herbst and the helpful comments from the anonymous referee .",
