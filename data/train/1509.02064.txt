    "such a light - shining - through - the - wall experiment requires a high quantum efficiency low background single - photon detector @xcite . a tungsten transition - edge sensor , which is optimized for low - background high quantum efficiency single photon detection , has been developed by nist ( national institute of standards and technology ) .",
    "tess are superconductive microcalorimeters measuring the temperature difference @xmath6 t induced by the absorption of a photon .",
    "they are operated in a strong negative electro - thermal feedback corresponding to a constant voltage bias .",
    "when a 1064 nm photon is absorbed by the tungsten chip , the sensor temperature raises by 0.1 mk .",
    "heating up of the detector brings it from its superconductive stage to close to its normal resistive stage with an increase of the resistance of @xmath6r @xmath7 1 @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to a decrease of the current with i @xmath7 70 na .",
    "tess are inductively coupled to a squid ( superconducting quantum interference device ) that converts this current variation in a voltage difference of @xmath6v @xmath7 -  50  mv .",
    "the alps ii detector module is constituted of two tess coupled to a squid .",
    "both detectors are @xmath9 large and 20 nm thick . a ceramic standard mating sleeve towers above each detector , allowing coupling of a standard single - mode fiber .",
    "transition - edge sensors are superconductive detectors .",
    "the detector needs to be placed in a bath at @xmath10 = 80 mk @xmath11 25 @xmath12k . in order to do so",

    "adr cryostats can reach two low - temperature levels @xcite .",
    "a temperature baseline of 2.5 k at the colder stages of the cryostat is reached with the help of a compressor using helium and a pulse - tube cooler . this cool - down s length in time",
    "is only limited by maintenance works and needed modifications of the setup . within a cool - down",
    ", many phases at 80 mk can be reached in two hours through adiabatic degmanetization .",
    "such a recharge lasts approximately 24 hours .",

    "[ sec : figures ]    the linearity of the alps ii w - tess was tested by analysing the detector response to different photon energies .",

    "[ fig : linearity ] , the average ph is shown depending on the energy of the photons absorbed by the detector .",
    "the sensors are linear in our region of interest ( 1.17 ev ) @xcite .",

    "stability during a cool - down as well as between different cool - downs has been checked successfully .",
    "the most essential characteristic of the detector is its stability during a recharge - cycle corresponding to the data - taking period .",
    "the tes bias current ( i.e. tes working point ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stability ] ) ) has been measured to be reasonably stable with a maximum gradient @xmath15 1.5 @xmath12a .",

    "transition - edge sensors seem to ideally meet the alps ii detector challenges .",
    "the characterization of the sensors provided by nist has demonstrated a good detector energy resolution as well as a good stability of the pulse shape over long - term measurements .",
