    "recent cosmological and astrophysical observations strongly suggests that a significant portion of energy density of the universe exists in a form of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "dm has been speculated after the observation of the galaxy matter velocity distribution .",
    "the angular frequency distribution of the cosmic microwave background radiation , recent surveys of the expansion rate of remote galaxies and the simulation of the structure formation support around 25% of energy density in a form of non - relativistic matter while only one sixths of such matter has been identified as visible one .    among many plausible theories of dm @xcite or equivalent modification of gravity @xcite , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) are of particular interest @xcite .",
    "the scenario with wimp assumes that dm particles were produced in the early universe by thermal processes and the dm relic density has been frozen out by decoupling since that epoch . the dm energy density from the current observation is well matched with such a thermal production scenario with an electroweak scale dm mass and appropriate electroweak scale interactions .",
    "it is also very interesting if dm has some interesting connection with the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking as in the minimal supersymmetric standard model  ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "above all , this wimp scenario motivates searches for dm particles by detecting and/or producing them directly in the laboratory .",
    "direct detection of dm has been carried out for several decades and the experimental sensitivity has been drastically improved in recent years @xcite .",
    "the abundant dm particles that flows through earth may sporadically collide with ordinary matter nuclei , resulting in the recoil of a nucleus .",
    "the current wimp search through the energy deposit in the cryogenic detector device has reached the dm cross - section with ordinary matter nuclei at the order of @xmath2 @xmath3 , and the upgraded cdms ii experiment @xcite has reached to this level .    in most dm models ,",
    "fermionic dm is a majorana particle , such as neutralino of the mssm @xcite .",
    "however , we can not rule out a dirac fermionic dm @xmath0 at present , and hence it is very important to consider physical effects of such dirac fermionic nature of dm . in this regard , we consider an appreciable magnetic moments of dm .",
    "in fact , the magnetic moments of neutral fermions were considered for a long time since the time of weak neutral currents @xcite up to the present age of dm @xcite .",
    "one notable feature in the scattering through magnetic moment of neutral fermion is that it has a larger cross section for a lower momentum photon exchange .",
    "the trend observed by two cdms ii candidates @xcite indeed show this behavior : the energy deposit at 12.3 kev and 15.5 kev ( just above the threshold of 10 kev ) while much larger energy deposit is allowed in that experiment . at this time with two possible low @xmath1 candidates of the cdms ii experiment @xcite , therefore",
    ", it is appropriate to scrutinize the dirac dm aspect more closely . in particular",
    ", we will pay attention to the magnetic moment @xmath4 of @xmath0 .",
    "is the magnetic moment of @xmath0 in units of the @xmath0 bohr magneton , @xmath5 . ] in principle , this study includes the effects of the electric dipole moment also , but we will not specify them explicitly which would have needed an additional assumption about cp violation .",
    "there have been several works on the dm dipole moments  @xcite . in these works , various observational constraints ( _ e.g. _ the cosmic microwave background radiation , the cosmic @xmath6ray detection , the dm relic abundance ) have been considered .",
    "although the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite commented other possibilities , they mainly considered dm models in which the thermal dm relic density is determined only by annihilation due to magnetic dipole interactions . however , as pointed out by @xcite , models that give rise to the dm magnetic moment interaction with the photon exchange usually have other annihilation channels . here , we consider the cases in which the relic density does not constrain the dm magnetic dipole moment .",
    "nonetheless , dm direct detection can constrain the dm magnetic dipole moment .    as a prototype",
    ", we consider supersymmetic ( susy ) models with extra charged singlets while direct interaction between dm and nuclei can be forbidden in the leading order .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment is generically induced by one - loop diagram .",
    "such models have been discussed in a certain class of leptophilic scenarios for explaining recent cosmic ray anomalies , where dm particle has suppressed coupling with colored particles .",
    "we also emphasize that our analysis fully includes nuclear anomalous magnetic moment interactions . without the photon exchange as in the neutralino case ,",
    "the @xmath7 form factor effects of such nucleus are usually negligible since the range of the dm ",
    "nucleus interaction is much smaller than the size of nucleus .",
    "however , the interaction through photon exchange can make the contribution comparable .",
    "the nucleus magnetic moment effect has not been considered properly in the previous works . here ,",
    "we present the dm detection rates including such effects and compare them with the recent cdms ii data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : magmom ] , we calculate the effective magnetic moment operator from a simple class of supersymmetric models . in generic models beyond the sm ,",
    "one - loop induced magnetic moment should usually have a similar structure calculated in this section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : decoupling ] , we calculate the decoupling temperature of @xmath0 by solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "we also use the @xmath8 bound to constrain the hypothetical yukawa coupling @xmath9 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : detection ] , we calculate the direct detection cross - section and show the @xmath1-dependence due to the magnetic moment , which can be observed by the recoil energy distribution .",
    "the behavior due to the magnetic moment is distinguishable from the predictions of other dm models .",
    "next , the cdms ii experimental report is discussed in the context of dm models with a large magnetic moment . in this section",
    ", we also comment on the collider phenomenology of this class of models .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is a brief conclusion , summarizing the allowed magnetic moment @xmath4 of dirac or almost - dirac dm models .",
    "a neutral dirac fermion @xmath0 can acquire a magnetic moment as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magmom ] if it couples to charged particles , fermion @xmath10 and boson @xmath11 , by a yukawa coupling , @xmath12h.c . in the mssm ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is not a dirac fermion and thus the lsp dm can not acquire a magnetic moment . however , in the extensions of mssm with extra singlet chiral superfield , which have been proposed for many reasons : to address @xmath13-problem or to raise the mass of the lightest higgs boson , the lsp @xmath14 of the mssm sector and the additional singlet @xmath0 may form a single dirac fermion state @xcite .    for a specific calculation",
    ", we consider the following superpotential which has been discussed in @xcite , @xmath15 in this model , there is no tree level interaction between @xmath0 and nucleus because it couples only to leptons and its scalar partners . for the magnetic moment ,",
    "the existence of the coupling of the type @xmath16 is the essential one , which can arise in many other models extending the sm . for dm magnetic moment",
    ", it is required that @xmath0 must be a dm component , presumably by an exact @xmath17 symmetry .",
    "actually eq.(1 ) is the simplest model in which the magnetic moment can play an essential role in the dm detection .",
    "more complicated cases can be obtained by its proper extensions .",
    "however , in the extension of mssm , the interaction type @xmath12h.c . is present through @xmath18 which however has to be avoided by the following reasons .",
    "firstly , after the higgs fields @xmath19 and @xmath20 develop vevs , they give a vev to @xmath0 , which is harmful because of the mass mixing with the electron @xmath21 .",
    "second , it splits masses of @xmath0 and @xmath22 , and the anomalous magnetic moment interaction is a transition type between two mass eigenstates , and hence the direct detection rate as a function of recoil energy must be considered more carefully if the mass difference is of order 110 kev .    for a dirac - type neutral fermion ,",
    "its electromagnetic interaction is dominated by the magnetic moment , as pointed out for the case of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "let us define the magnetic moment of @xmath0 as @xmath23 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) , @xmath4 is estimated from fig .",
    "[ fig : magmom ] @xcite , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the fermion ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 is the mass of the boson ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) in the one - loop diagram .",
    "this calculation is an illustration for a sizable magnetic moment of a hypothetical dm particle @xmath0 . as shown here ,",
    "a large magnetic moment is not unreasonable since @xmath0 is considered to be heavy .",
    "if mass eigenstates splits the mass by a tiny amount , then the magnetic moment is of transition type with the initial @xmath0 and the final @xmath0 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defmmom ] ) considered different .",
    "then , the lifetime of the heavier component is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass difference between two mass eigenstates of this almost - dirac fermion .",
    "if the lifetime falls in the @xmath33 s region with parameters chosen appropriately , then the decay products of @xmath0 deposit energy in the cryogenic detector .",
    "this happens for @xmath34 in which case the real signal from the cryogenic data must be revamped .",
    "let us now proceed to discuss the effects of a large magnetic moment of an extra singlet dm @xmath0 in cosmology and in particle phenomenology .",
    "the dm relic density is given in terms of the velocity averaged annihilation cross section ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the dominant annihilation channel of the dirac dm @xmath0 allowed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) is @xmath36 , which is mediated by exchange of the scalar component of @xmath27 .",
    "it is straightforward to evaluate @xmath37 , which is approximately given by @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 are @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "although there is also the annihilation by the magnetic dipole moment , eq .",
    "( [ eq : defmmom ] ) , we will neglect it because its order of magnitude is estimated as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 annihilation cross section .    0.6 cm    in fig .",
    "[ fig : figrelic ] for @xmath46  gev , we show the allowed region from the constraint on the cosmic relic density and also from the @xmath47 bound .",
    "the excluded regions are the lower right wedge and the upper left wedge . toward the @xmath0 dm scenario",
    ", we also excluded the kinematically forbidden region @xmath48 .",
    "for the muon magnetic moment , we use the formula given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) with @xmath49 and eq .",
    "( [ eq : gminustwo ] ) .",
    "the electron magnetic moment bound is buried in the muon magnetic moment bound .",
    "for the cases of @xmath50  gev and 150  gev , the boundaries are shown as the lavender line and the green dash line , respectively .    since @xmath4 is of order @xmath51 , the condition @xmath52 , as commented below eq .",
    "( [ eq : insidedecay ] ) , is satisfied only in a small skyblue dashed - arc region in the lower - left allowed region of fig .",
    "[ fig : figrelic ] . except in this small area",
    ", we need not consider the possibility of a heavier component decay in the cryogenic detector .",
    "at low @xmath1 , the photon wavelength exceeds the nuclear size and hence the whole nucleus , with charge and magnetic moment , acts as a target .",
    "thus , the elastic scattering cross section for the case of a spin @xmath53 nucleus target becomes , viz .",

    "the first two terms ( ` @xmath62 terms ' ) in the right hand side of eq .  (",

    "@xcite ) . using appendix",

    "[ fig : magmomscatt ] , we present the differential event detection rate for @xmath86 gev , eq .",
    "( [ eq : eventrate ] ) , as a solid line above the cdms ii threshold of about 10 kev . the neutralino dm case with @xmath87 gev",
    "is shown as a dashed line . to show the recoil energy dependence , we choose an arbitrary normalization such that both of these lines match at 10 kev .",
    "the target is ge with @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "its anomalous magnetic moment is @xmath90 as shown in table [ tab : mgmm ] .",
    "the @xmath91 dependence in the first term of eq . ( [ eq : crosssec ] ) generically leads the @xmath92 to diverge in low @xmath93 limit .",
    "however , such a divergent effect is diminished by small velocity of wimp , @xmath94 which appears in the coefficient of the @xmath95-term as follows : @xmath96 due to the suppression of the ir divergent feature in non - relativistic scattering , the @xmath92 divergently larger than @xmath97 only in the region below @xmath98 , while the slope of the @xmath92 above @xmath99 becomes eventually more flatter than the si .",
    "this is why the @xmath92 distribution looks larger than @xmath97 above @xmath100 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : magmomscatt ] )",
    ". this non - relativistic @xmath101- suppression in the @xmath95-term might result in further interesting possibility .",
    "due to the suppression , ` @xmath62 terms ' can be comparable to each other , even with ` @xmath7 terms ' . in this regard ,",
    "we obtain the upper - bound on the dm magnetic moment from the recent cdms ii data for both of the @xmath102 and @xmath103 cases .",
    "the `` maximal gap method''@xcite is used to estimate the proper allowed region with a @xmath104 confidence level .",
    "the most stringent bound appears as @xmath105 for @xmath106 gev and @xmath107 .",
    "when we ignore the contributions of nucleus anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath102 , then the upper - bound of @xmath4 is @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "taking into account the non - zero @xmath7 , the upper - bound goes down to @xmath110 for @xmath111 . the event rate becomes larger with non - zero @xmath7 so that the allowed region is more constrained , producing @xmath112 of difference in @xmath4 .",
    "however , we can easily expect that depending on the materials in direct detection experiments , the difference can be significantly amplified due to the enhanced magnetic dipole moment effect .",
    "thus , it is worthwhile to study the dm multi - pole interactions with nuclei more carefully .",
    "we considered a dirac or an almost - dirac dm @xmath0 which may acquire a large magnetic moment . using the possible dipole interactions , we estimated the signal event rate which is expected in the cdms ii experiment . using the recent report of the cdms ii experiment , we present the upper - bound of the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "the most stringent bound appears for @xmath106 gev and @xmath107 : @xmath113 with a sizable nucleus anomalous dipole moment @xmath7 contribution .",
    "we point out that this sizable @xmath7 contribution is possible in the non - relativistic scattering of wimp and nucleus , leading to a several factor improvement in the exclusion plot . in the future refined direct dm search experiments ,",
    "the possibility of dm magnetic moment of @xmath0 can be probed with another independent information on its mass .        in the calculation of scattering cross - section of dm with target nuclei",
    ", we treated the nuclei as a spin @xmath53 particle .",
    "however , many nuclei used in the direct detection of dm have spin different from @xmath53 . moreover",
    ", our parametrization of the magnetic moment using @xmath7 , in which spin @xmath53 for nuclei has been assumed , should be matched to produce a realistic value .",
    "for that , we consider two body wave function , in non - relativistic quantum mechanics with non - local interaction , which is obtained after integrating out the photon field , @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the nuclear wave function with @xmath116 and @xmath117 is the dm wave function with @xmath118 .",
    "the scrdinger equation for this two body system reads @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the monopole ",
    "dipole and dipole  dipole interactions , respectively . here",
    ", we neglected unimportant normalization for each terms because we only need to match the dependency on the nucleon spin .",
    "since the initial state of the problem is unpolarized , its density matrix is proportional to the identity in @xmath122-dimensional space , that is , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the spin of nuclei and dm , respectively .",
    "therefore , after averaging the polarizations , the cross - section is proportional to @xmath126 $ ] , where @xmath55 is @xmath127 for the dipole - dipole interaction contribution , the cross - section in the leading order becomes @xmath128\\\\ & \\propto\\frac{|g_{\\rm dm}g_{\\rm nuclei}|^2}{(2s_n+1)(2s_\\chi+1 ) } { \\rm tr}\\left [ \\vec s^{(n)}\\cdot\\vec",

    "if we use @xmath131 we see that the term involving @xmath130 is proportional to @xmath132 .",
    "it confirms that our parametrization of @xmath7 in the text is appropriate .",
