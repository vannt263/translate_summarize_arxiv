    "the different scaling behavior of @xmath28 and @xmath29 as @xmath30 ( breit frame ) is reflected in the coefficients in eq.([eq : g123 ] ) , where the coefficient of @xmath21 is independent of @xmath31 , while the contribution from @xmath20 in eq.([eq : g123 ] ) grows linearly with @xmath31 .",
    "this is typical for operators of different twist .",
    "clearly , the non - leading role played by @xmath29 makes it rather difficult to separate them from the leading twist term @xmath28 ( and from @xmath32 corrections to @xmath28 ) .",

    "the way i presented the derivation of these sum rules , it seems that they are mere consequences of rotational invariance and hence there should be no question about their validity in qcd .",
    "however , there are several subtleties if one wants to turn these sum rules for the @xmath42 s ( the light - cone correlators ) into sum rules for the @xmath43 s ( the experimentally measured cross sections ) .",
    "discussing these subtleties will be the main purpose of the rest of this paper . here",
    "i only mention that the ope result is derived using dispersion relations for the lepton - nucleon forward scattering amplitude and in general there is always the possibility that the dispersion relation does not converge or that the dispersion relation requires a finite subtraction .",
    "similar results apply for the chirally odd parton distributions @xmath44 defined as @xcite @xmath45 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 .",

    "similarly to the sum rules for the @xmath51 one can derive sum rules for the @xmath52 by integrating eq.([eq : h123 ] ) and one finds @xcite , using again rotational invariance , @xmath53 as is the case for the @xmath41-sum rule , the @xmath54-sum rule is most certainly useless , but since measurements for @xmath50 and @xmath55 are under way , it will soon be possible to test the @xmath55-sum rule ( [ eq : hlsr ] ) experimentally . in principle , the same comments that i made above for the @xmath56 sum rule also apply for the @xmath55 sum rule .",
    "however , as i will discuss in section [ sec : pert ] , it seems to be violated already in perturbation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : ope ] , i will explain the connection between the light - cone correlation functions and the experimentally measured quantities and why the formal sum rules  derived for the light - cone correlation functions  may be violated when applied to the measured structure functions .",
    "in section [ sec : pert ] , i will show that the @xmath57 sum rule is violated in qcd . in the following sections i will study some model filed theories and simple ( spin - independent ) higher - twist parton distributions and i will attempt to shed some light on the physics of such violations of sum rules . in the appendix ,",
    "i will draw connections to the notorious zero - modes plaguing the light - front community .",
    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) experiments are performed in the region @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the operator product expansion is an expansion around @xmath59 and must diverge for @xmath60 because of the singularities of the hadronic tensor ( the physical discontinuity along the cut ) .",
    "the consequences of these statements are easily demonstrated by considering some hadronic tensor @xmath61 , where @xmath62 . to keep the discussion as general as possible",
    ", we will consider here some generic forward scattering amplitude , without specifying the current .",
    "this will allow us later to draw very general conclusions .",
    "a very similar discussion , for the specific example of @xmath63 , can be found in ref.@xcite .    as an function of @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath61 is analytic in the complex plane , cut along @xmath64 .",
    "the discontinuity of the imaginary part along the cut is ( up to trivial kinematic factors ) the experimentally measured cross section , which we will denote by @xmath65 . in order to apply the ope",
    ", one needs to relate @xmath61 for @xmath66 to @xmath61 for @xmath67 . from the theory of complex functions",
    "it is well known that an analytic function is determined by its singularities in the complex plane  up to a polynomial ! this implies ( @xmath66 ) @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a polynomial in @xmath70 whose coefficients do in general depend on @xmath3 . in the language of regge theory ,",
    "such polynomial subtractions are called `` fixed poles '' @xcite .",
    "note that we specialized here on an odd function of @xmath71 , the generalization to the even case follows analogously .",
    "usually , only a few coefficients of the polynomial are allowed to be nonzero , since otherwise unitarity bounds are violated , but typically this places no restriction on the lowest few terms .",
    "for @xmath72 one can apply the ope and one finds @xmath73 where the coefficients are related to matrix elements of local operators .",
    "if one allows for generalized functions , it is always possible to find a function @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 in the case of the moments appearing in the ope for dis this function typically is a fourier transform of a correlation function along the light - cone , such as the @xmath42 and @xmath76 introduced in eqs.([eq : g123],[eq : h123 ] ) .    in order to demonstrate",
    "what happened if the subtraction polynomial does not vanish , let us study an example , where the polynomial is finite ) does not converge and hence one needs an infinite subtraction .",
    "such a case may be considered as a limit of the situation assumed here . ] and first order @xmath77 . upon inserting @xmath78 in eq.([eq : disp ] ) and introducing the moments of the measured structure function @xmath79 one thus finds @xmath80 such a result , if @xmath81 is nonzero , has a two major consequences :    * any sum rule , derived for @xmath82 , fails to be satisfied for @xmath83 . whether or not the sum rule derived using the ope applies also to the experimentally observed structure functions depends on whether or not the amplitudes satisfy un - subtracted dispersion relation . *",
    "even when @xmath84 is a smooth function , since all moments except the lowest moment of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the same , it must be that @xmath87 contains a @xmath4-function at the origin ( which obviously afflicts only the lowest moment ) @xmath88    a few more comments are in order here .",
    "so far , i have only discussed what happens if there is such a subtraction . in the rest of the paper",
    "i will show ( studying qcd perturbation theory as well as some toy models ) that this is actually a very common phenomenon . in these examples",
    "i will furthermore demonstrate , that the light - cone correlations indeed contain @xmath4-functions , even when the `` data '' is very smooth , and that the coefficient of the @xmath4-functions indeed coincides with subtraction constants in dispersion relations .",
    "furthermore , i should emphasize that the @xmath4-functions do * not * arise from some obscure @xmath89 limit but from inverting a moment transformation at fixed and finite @xmath3 .",
    "so far , the discussion has been deliberately abstract .",
    "even though we have seen what happens _ if _ the dispersion relations contain subtractions , we have not yet shown _ whether _ this actually happens . as a first step in this direction we will perform a perturbative analysis of @xmath1 and @xmath0 in this section .",

    "the only troublesome piece arises from the term proportional to @xmath96 . in order to study its contribution",
    "further , one can make use of the algebraic identity @xmath97 one can easily verify that the first two terms on r.h.s . of eq.([eq :",
    "alg ] ) are well behaved as @xmath95 , when inserted in eq.([eq : numalg ] ) .",
    "the only troublemaker is the term proportional to @xmath98 in the numerator . using @xmath99 one finds for the singular piece @xmath100 where @xmath101 is some cutoff and where we used @xmath102 , i.e. @xmath103 . the factor @xmath104 on the r.h.s . arises from the matrix element of @xmath105 .",
    "the precise numerical result is not so important here .",
    "what is important is that straightforward evaluation of our perturbative model yields a term proportional to a @xmath4 function for @xmath1 . +   +    ( 14,6)(0,-8 . )     + 1.cm    ( 5,0)(0,0 ) ( 1.,0)(1,0)7 .",
    "+ the singular term derived here is explicitly proportional to the current quark mass , i.e. only for strange or heavier quarks one expects a sizable contribution , and thus violation of the @xmath57-sum rule .",
    "however , it is not known whether this is only a lowest order artifact or whether this is a more general result . certainly , using hard - soft factorization , this result implies a @xmath106 term with nonzero coefficient also in the full ( i.e. nonperturbative ) result for @xmath1 and thus the @xmath55-sum rule should be violated for strange and heavier quarks .",
    "it should be emphasized that while we have identified the quark mass as one source of violation for the @xmath55-sum rule , it is by no means clear whether or not there are are other sources of further violation which would also affect light @xmath107 and @xmath108 quarks .",
    "before we are going to investigate the physical origin of the @xmath4-function , let us first take a look at qcd perturbative corrections to @xmath0 for a quark .",
    "@xmath109    from the purely formal point - of - view the @xmath4-function in @xmath1 arises because of the term proportional to the light - front energy @xmath110 in the numerator , which cancels the energy dominator for the gluon propagator .",
    "armed with this insight , we can immediately focus on the potentially dangerous terms in @xmath56 arising from the @xmath96 in the numerator of the fermion propagator in the numerator from the gauge field propagator are accompanied here by an explicit factor @xmath111 in the fermion propagator and are thus harmless . ]",
    "@xmath112 \\gamma^\\mu = 0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. because of the dirac algebra , the coefficient of the potentially singular term in @xmath0 vanishes .",
    "in contrast to the result for @xmath1 , at least in one loop order , radiative qcd corrections do not give rise to @xmath4-functions in @xmath0 .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that sum rules for higher - twist parton distributions can be easily violated .",
    "however , so far , we lack an intuitive understanding of the effect . in this ( and the following ) section",
    "we will turn our attention to simple toy models , where the same effect happens , but where it is easier to analyse . for the same reason , we will study the ( spin independent ) scalar higher - twist distribution @xmath113 in the rest of the paper . both , working in 1 + 1 dimensions and studying scalar distributions will simplify the algebra involved considerably and thus allow us to shed some light on the essential physics .",
    "the general conclusions should not be affected by these simplifications .",
    "one of the most simple examples for violations of sum rules for higher - twist distributions is a @xmath114-dimensional model of the gross  neveu type @xcite @xmath115 where @xmath116 are `` color '' indices . here",

    "yields a `` pure '' @xmath4-function and is not contaminated with higher multipoles , like @xmath154 . ]",
    "the fact that @xmath152 is independent of @xmath78 , to leading order in @xmath155 is quite obvious , since the leading order in the @xmath155 approximation is similar to a mean field approximation .",
    "the expectation value of a scalar density , taken in a plane wave state , is a constant  independent of the momentum .",
    "therefore , the @xmath107-quark gives rise to a source for @xmath156-quarks [ through the point - like scalar coupling in eq .",

    "thus one might suspect that the unique properties of the interaction term in eq ,  ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) are the reason for our `` weird '' results :    * @xmath130 smooth ( actually identically zero in this example ) ; * @xmath130 violates the sum rule ( the sum rule converges without problems ) ; * @xmath113 contains a @xmath4-function ; and * @xmath113 satisfies the sum rule .",
    "in particular , one might suspect that `` more realistic '' field theories ( like qcd@xmath157 ) behave differently . in the rest of this article",
    "we will demonstrate that some of these properties are actually quite generic for higher - twist distributions in many field theories ( also qcd@xmath157 ) .    a non - trivial and non - perturbative example",

    "@xmath209 do not have a definite transformation property under @xmath210 either . ]",
    "@xmath211 however , the presence of the subtraction term in ( [ eq:3.13 ] ) means that one can identify @xmath212 with @xmath213 only for @xmath214 .",
    "it is instructive to re - analyze the situation from the point of view of the infinite momentum frame . in eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) large , one boosts the target and not the observer .",
    "however , this is equivalent . ] as @xmath153 one almost recovers the naive picture , where all virtual constituents carry a positive , finite fraction of the hadrons momentum : @xmath215 drops sharply at @xmath216 for @xmath217 in fig .  4 and vanishes for @xmath218 .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of vacuum fluctuations in the @xmath219-momentum frame because this would require at least one particle carrying a negative momentum fraction @xcite .",
    "however , some component of the wave function of the @xmath107-quark `` lacks behind '' in the boost ( [ eq:3.10 ] ) .",
    "this can be summarized in the following physical picture .",
    "as @xmath153 most of the soft modes decouple from the system , which is partly responsible for the simplified dynamics in the _ infinite momentum frame_. of course these modes do nt completely disappear but get concentrated in the region near @xmath220 . while leading twist distributions couple only weakly to this component of the wave function",
    ", there is a stronger coupling of the higher - twist distributions .",
    "that is why leading twist distributions do not contain these @xmath4-functions .",
    "a very similar and related effect was first observed in the context of qed@xmath157 @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that certain connected vacuum graphs do survive the @xmath153 limit .",
    "since @xmath113 is , up to the momentum projection , proportional to a mass insertion , it should be clear that the non - covariant piece in the self - energy of an electron in qed  which is all that survives from the @xmath221-graph as @xmath153  is ( up to mass derivative ) proportional to the @xmath4-function contribution one finds for @xmath113 in qed .",
    "i should emphasize again that , if such a situation applies to experimentally measured higher twist distributions , one would not be able to `` see '' any hint about the singular behavior of the light - cone distribution by just looking at the structure function .",
    "we have investigated higher - twist distributions in a variety of field theories .",
    "this included perturbative examples in @xmath181 as well and @xmath194 dimensions .",
    "dimensions , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of @xmath158 in the context of qcd@xmath159 ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the scalar density in the sine - gordon model . ] in most cases the naive sum rules for the lowest moments of higher - twist distributions are violated when summed over the `` experimentally determined '' distributions . for non - zero @xmath222 ,",
    "these structure functions scale towards the fourier transformed quark - quark correlation in the hadron along the light - cone .",
    "the phenomenon which causes the failure of the sum rules for higher - twist structure functions is a @xmath4-function at the origin in the light - cone distribution .",
    "structure function and light - cone distribution coincide for non - zero @xmath35 , while the @xmath4-function is absent in the structure function .",
    "the sum - rules are valid when one includes the @xmath4-function , _ i.e. _ when applied to the light - cone distribution .",
    "the structure functions then cease to satisfy the sum rule because they do not contain the @xmath4-function . in that sense",
    "the @xmath4-function destroys the sum rule . from a theorist s point of view",
    ", the @xmath4-function restores it , _",
    "i.e. _ when added to the structure function the combined result should reproduce the sum rule .",
    "the last point may however be of purely academic interest , since one can not measure the light - cone correlation directly .",
    "the relation between light - cone correlations and structure functions is usually based on the operator product expansion combined with dispersion relations . unless one has a theoretical or experimental constraints on the high - energy behavior of the real part of the scattering amplitude ,",
    "subtraction constants can not be ruled out .",
    "in fact , the coefficient of the @xmath4-function is proportional to such a high - energy subtraction .",
    "this also shows that the long - range correlation along the light - cone are consistent with the ope .    in coordinate space language",
    "this means that only part of the sea quark distribution gets lorentz contracted when the @xmath107-quark is boosted ( giving rise to the finite-@xmath223 component ) , while another component looks the same in all frames ( contributing only at @xmath224 ) . in @xmath194-dimensional examples ( similar to the one above )",
    "this means that the hadron does not become a `` pancake '' as @xmath153 .",
    "only part of the wave function is lorentz contracted while some rest retains its spherical shape .",
    "there is nothing wrong or inconsistent about this result .",
    "it is only another example where naive intuition ( in this case based on the lorentz transformation properties in free field theory ) fails .",
    "interacting fields may have very complicated transformation properties which , in the above example , cause that part of the wavefunction does not lorentz contract in the same way as free fields do .",
    "this also `` explains '' why higher - twist distributions are more vulnerable to these effects , since , in the parton model , they contain interaction terms explicitly .    from the point of view of null plane quantization ,",
    "the @xmath4-functions are a manifestation of zero - modes @xcite in the hadronic wave function ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "higher - twist parton distributions are defined through correlations which involve bad currents ( _ i.e. _ @xmath225 component of the spinors ) . when solving the constraint equation for @xmath225 one has to specify boundary conditions at @xmath226 .",
    "non - zero values at the boundary are of course related to @xmath4-functions in the fourier transform .",
    "another ( not necessarily independent ) connection to the failure of canonical light - cone quantization ( without zero modes ) is observed by considering the singular part of @xmath113 . in perturbation",
    "theory one finds that the derivative of the non - covariant @xmath227 term in the fermion self - energy with respect to the quark mass is proportional to the @xmath4-function coefficient in @xmath113 . again",
    "this should not be a surprise , since those terms are caused by an improper treatment of the zero modes @xcite in canonical light - cone perturbation theory @xcite  unless one uses several pauli ",
    "villars regulators ( more than in a manifestly covariant approach)@xcite .    in practical applications , most sum rules for higher - twist distributions",
    "are probably useless since one expects them to diverge @xcite .",
    "the discussion of @xmath113 in this work should therefore be considered only a pedagogical example .",
    "one exception seems to be @xmath228 . from a regge pole analysis one",
    "expects the burkhardt ",
    "cottingham sum rule to converge @xcite .",
    "also , as shown in section  [ sec : pert ] , perturbation theory does not indicate any divergences in qcd .",
    "furthermore , regge pole analysis @xcite as well as perturbative considerations ( section  iv ) suggest validity of the sum rule . however , no strict predictions for @xmath228 have been made on a non - perturbative basis so far and at this point one has to wait for the experimental result to see whether the @xmath228-sum rule is valid .    for strange or heavier quarks , the @xmath55 sum rule seems to be most certainly violated .",
    "the perturbative analysis in this work only yielded a violation proportional to the quark mass and thus one might be tempted to assume validity of the @xmath55 sum rule for @xmath107 and @xmath108 quarks .",
    "however , it is not clear whether other effects , which have not been considered in this work , lead to a violation for light quarks as well .",
    "even if these sum - rules are violated , the ope remains valid .",
    "what needs to be added is a subtraction in the dispersion relation .",
    "note that such a mechanism can not be used to `` explain '' the spin crisis , since @xmath229 is leading twist and thus a subtraction in the dispersion relation would be in conflict with unitarity constraints .",
    "the @xmath4-function at the origin in @xmath113 strongly suggests a relation to zero modes in light - cone quantization @xcite . due to the severe infrared singularities in light - cone quantization ( the kinetic energy diverges as @xmath230 ) it turns out to be necessary to go on a finite interval . furthermore , following lenz _",
    "et al._@xcite , we will use a tilted coordinate system @xmath231 where the @xmath232 refers to the `` usual '' light - cone coordinates @xmath233 the notation in this appendix will thus be different from the rest of the paper in order to allow for a direct comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite , which is strongly recommended to supplement this appendix .",
    "this implies for example for scalar products @xmath234 @xmath235 refers to the length of the interval and we will impose periodic boundary conditions in @xmath143 .",
    "the canonically conjugate momentum @xmath236 thus becomes quantized @xmath237 for the linear @xmath168-model ( [ eq:3.1 ] ) one thus finds to order @xmath238",
    "@xmath239 \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad   - \\left . \\frac{1 } { 2}\\ \\left [ { \\frac{l}{2\\epsilon } } k^2_-+ m^2\\right]^{-3/2 } \\right\\}\\ , \\label{eq : a.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath240 of course @xmath241 as well as @xmath236 take on only discrete values ( a.4 ) . here",
    "@xmath172 is some numerical constant proportional to @xmath238 .",
    "one immediately recognizes the similarity to eq .",
    "( 3.8 ) , which is not completely accidental , since the infinite momentum boost also gives some kind of regularized representation for @xmath113 .",
    "the canonical light - cone limit for @xmath242 is obtained by taking @xmath243 while keeping @xmath244 and @xmath245 fixed ( @xmath246 , @xmath247 ) . using @xmath248 this yields ( @xmath249 ) , @xmath250 ^ 2 } \\theta(y ) \\theta(1-y)\\ \\ ,   \\label{eq : a.8}\\ ] ] for @xmath251 .",
    "however , for @xmath252 , @xmath253 _ i.e. _ the zero mode contribution diverges .",
    "the mere fact that @xmath254 diverges reflects the existence of the @xmath4-function in the continuum calculation .",
    "however , if one actually wants to make a quantitative comparison with section  iii , one has to perform a more sophisticated continuum limit where also the hadron momentum @xmath244 ( in discrete units ) approaches infinity .",
