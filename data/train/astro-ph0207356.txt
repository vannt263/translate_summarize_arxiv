    "in the gravitational instability scenario ( _ e.g. _ , peebles 1980 ) , mass density fluctuations and peculiar velocities evolve in an expanding universe under the effect of gravity .",
    "if density fluctuations are small , linear theory is valid and a simple relation exists between peculiar velocities , @xmath8 , and mass density contrast , @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath2 is the mass density parameter .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : divv ] ) shows why peculiar motions are so important in cosmology : they provide a direct probe of the mass density distribution in the universe .",
    "the mass density fluctuation field , @xmath9 , can be deduced from the galaxy observed density contrast , @xmath11 , assuming a relation ( bias ) between the distribution of galaxies and that of the underlying density .",
    "the simplest relation suggested in the literature is that of linear bias , namely @xmath12 , where @xmath3 is the linear bias parameter for a given population of mass tracers .",
    "this assumption seems to hold on very large ( linear ) scales and it is supported by both observational evidence ( e.g. baker _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 and seaborne _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ) and numerical studies ( _ e.g. _ , blanton",
    "_ et al . _ , 1999 ) .",
    "many authors have used galaxies peculiar velocities and their redshift space positions to estimate the value of @xmath1 , under the hypotheses of linear theory and linear biasing .",
    "these analyses have been typically carried out using two alternative strategies . in the so - called density - density comparisons a 3-d velocity field and a self - consistent mass density field",
    "are derived from observed radial velocities and compared to the galaxy density field measured from large redshift surveys .",
    "the typical example is the comparison of the mass density field reconstructed with the potent method ( bertschinger & dekel 1989 , dekel _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) from the mark iii catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities ( willick _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997a ) with the galaxy density field obtained from the iras 1.2 jy redshift catalog ( sigad _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "the various applications of density - density comparisons to a number of datasets have persistently led to large estimates of @xmath4 , consistent with unity ( see sigad _",
    "et al . _ , 1998 and references therein ) . the alternative approach is constituted by the velocity - velocity analyses . in this second case",
    "the observed galaxy distribution is used to infer a mass density field from which peculiar velocities are obtained and compared to the observed ones .",
    "the velocity - velocity methods have been applied to most of the velocity catalogs presently available yielding systematically lower values of @xmath4 , in the range @xmath13 ( see zaroubi 2002a , for a summary of the most recent results ) .",
    "both density - density and velocity - velocity methods have been carefully tested using mock catalogs extracted from n - body simulations .",
    "they were shown to provide an unbiased estimate of the @xmath4 parameter . yet , when applied to the same datasets , the discrepancy in the @xmath4 estimates turned out to be significantly larger than the expected errors .",
    "accounting for mildly nonlinear motions ( e.g. sigad _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 and willick _ et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ) or allowing for possible deviations from a pure linear biasing relation consistent with the observational constraints ( see discussion in somerville _ et al . _ , 2001 , branchini _ et al._2001 ) does not explain this discrepancy ( berlind , narayanan and weinberg 2001 ) .",
    "velocity - velocity comparisons are generally regarded as more reliable as they require manipulation of the denser and more homogeneous , redshift catalog data . whereas , the density - density comparisons involve manipulation of the noisier and sparser velocity data . in any case both classes of methods are quite complicated and it is hard to understand how systematic errors can arise and propagate through the analysis .",
    "therefore , it is likely that these systematics affect the @xmath4 parameter estimation .",
    "the purpose of this work is to address , and possibly solve , the density - density _ vs. _ velocity - velocity dichotomy .",
    "we achieve this goal by using the novel unbiased minimal variance estimator , recently proposed by zaroubi ( 2002b ) .",
    "the umv estimator allows one to reconstruct an unbiased cosmological field at any point in space from sparse , noisy and incomplete data and to map it into a dynamically - related cosmic field ( @xmath14 to go from peculiar velocities to overdensities ) .",
    "the umv is applied here to the secat catalog of peculiar velocities ( zaroubi 2002b ) to reconstruct both the mass density and peculiar velocity fields .",
    "these fields are then compared with the analogous quantities predicted from the distribution of iras psc@xmath0 galaxies ( saunders _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) of density - density and a velocity - velocity analyses .",
    "in section  [ sec : method ] we briefly review the basics of the umv estimator .",
    "the secat and psc@xmath0 catalogs are presented in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "error estimation from mock catalogs is described in   [ sec : mock ] .",
    "the density and velocity fields obtained by applying umv to secat are compared in section  [ sec : results ] with the analogous quantities deduced from the psc@xmath0 dataset .",
    "finally , in sections  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the results and present our conclusions .",
    "the derivation and general properties of the umv estimator have been already presented and discussed by zaroubi ( 2002b ) .",
    "therefore , we only review its main properties . as in the case of wiener filter ( wiener 1949 , zaroubi _",
    "et al . _ , 1995 ) , the umv introduces a general framework of linear estimation and prediction by minimizing the variance of the estimator with respect to the underlying signal , subject to linear constraints on the data .",
    "the solution of the minimization problem yields the umv estimator , which was shown to be a very effective tool for reconstructing the large scale structure of the universe from incomplete , noisy and sparse data ( zaroubi 2002b ) .",
    "one of the main drawbacks of the wiener filter is that it suppresses the amplitude of the estimated signal .",
    "the suppression factor is roughly equal to the @xmath15 ratio , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the limit of very poor signal - to - noise data , which in the context of this work correspond to galaxy peculiar velocities , the estimated field approaches zero value .",
    "by contrast , the umv estimator has been specifically designed to not alter the values of the reconstructed field at the locations of the data points , thus avoiding spurious suppression effects .",
    "an unbiased estimate of the reconstructed field at any point in space is then obtained by interpolating between the data points , according to the correlation function assumed _ a priori_. like the wiener filter the new estimator can be used for dynamical reconstructions , _",
    "i.e. _ , to recover one dynamical field from another measured field , _",
    "e.g. _ , mass over - density from radial peculiar velocity .",
    "these two properties make the umv estimator a very appealing tool for studying the lss and cmb .    here",
    "we apply the umv estimator to reconstruct the density and velocity fields in the local universe from the radial peculiar velocities of the secat galaxies .",
    "the data points consist of a set of observed radial peculiar velocities , @xmath16 , measured at positions @xmath17 with estimated errors @xmath18 , assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "the observed velocities are thus related to the true 3d underlying velocity field @xmath19 , or to its radial component @xmath20 , via    @xmath21    we assume that the peculiar velocity field @xmath19 and the density fluctuation field @xmath22 are related via linear gravitational - instability theory , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath2 is the matter mean density parameter . under the assumption of a specific theoretical prior for the power spectrum @xmath25 of the underlying density field , we can write the umv estimator of the 3d velocity field as , @xmath26 and the umv estimator of the density field as , @xmath27    within the framework of linear theory and assuming that the velocities are drawn from a gaussian random field , the two - point velocity - velocity and density - velocity correlation matrices ( bracketed quantities in eqs .",
    "[ eq : vumv ] &  [ eq : dumv ] ) are readily calculated .",
    "note that the normalization of the power spectrum drops out of the field estimation .",
    "the calculation of these matrices is discussed elsewhere ( grski 1988 ; zaroubi _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995,1999 ) .    the assumption that linear theory is valid on all scales enables us to choose the resolution as well . in particular it allows us to use two different smoothing kernels for the data and for the recovered fields . in our case",
    "no smoothing was applied to the radial velocity data while we choose to reconstruct the density and velocity fields with a finite gaussian smoothing of radius , @xmath28 .",
    "this choice alters the velocity - velocity and density - velocity correlation functions that appear in the first bracketed terms of the right hand side of eqs .",
    "[ eq : vumv ] and  [ eq : dumv ] , respectively , by introducing a multiplicative term @xmath29 $ ] in the model power spectrum .",
    "the amplitude of the reconstructed matter density field given in equation  [ eq : dumv ] is proportional to @xmath30 , while that of the density field obtained the psc@xmath0 galaxy distribution is proportional to the biasing parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the comparison between these density fields will constrain the value of @xmath31 . the velocity field reconstruction from the secat data set , however , is independent of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "hence in the velocity - velocity comparison @xmath4 enters as a solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : divv ] for the psc@xmath0 velocities , with the matter density given as the ratio @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the psc@xmath0 density field .",
    "the error covariance matrix , or variance of the residuals , of the reconstructed density and velocity fields could be calculated theoretically ( zaroubi 2002b ) .",
    "however , in order to give a more complete account of the various errors that enter the calculation ( _ e.g. _ , nonlinear effects ) here we choose to calculate the error from mock catalogs ( see section  [ sec : mock ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the umv algorithm with other methods of reconstruction used for similar purposes . in the context of mass - density reconstruction from radial peculiar velocities , comparison with the potent algorithm ( bertschinger & dekel 1989 , dekel _ et al .",
    "_ , 1990 ) is of special interest .",
    "the main assumption behind the potent algorithm is that the flow field , smoothed on large scale , is derived from a velocity potential .",
    "the potential flow assumption is a direct result of linear theory but can also be employed in the quasi - linear regime until the onset of shell crossing , when an extension of eq .",
    "[ eq : divv ] applies ( nusser _ et al .",
    "_ , 1991 ) .",
    "potent could be viewed as a direct inversion method which uses the minimum amount of assumptions , but suffers from the problems of direct deconvolution of very noisy data .    in conclusion",
    ", the umv reconstruction can be regarded as a compromise between the potent algorithm , which assumes no regularization but might be unstable to the inversion problem of deconvolving highly noisy data , and the wf algorithm , which takes into account the correlation between the data points and therefore stabilizes the inversion , but constitutes a biased estimator of the underlying field .",
    "the main dataset used here is the secat catalog of galaxy peculiar velocities which results from the merging of 1300 spiral galaxies taken from the sfi catalog ( giovanelli _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997a and 1997b and haynes _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999a and 1999b ) and about 2000 early type galaxies from the enear catalog grouped into @xmath34 750 independent objects ( da costa _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) . for each object the radial velocity and inferred distance , corrected for malmquist bias ( freudling _ et al .",
    "_ , 1995 , da costa _ et al . _ , 2000 ) , are provided along with the velocity errors that typically amount to @xmath35 of the galaxy distance .",

    "however , several pieces of evidence indicate that this is not a serious problem for the secat catalog .",
    "first of all , both the sfi and enear catalogs are intrinsically homogeneous as they consist of uniform data covering most of the sky . secondly , as shown in bernardi",
    "_ et al._(2002b ) , the distance relations independently calibrated in the two sets are consistent with each other and the difference in the hubble constant deduced from each catalog is @xmath36 kms^-1km@xmath37s@xmath38/mpc . finally , different statistical analyses carried out using either samples lead to consistent results ( _ e.g. _ , borgani",

    "_ , 2001 , zaroubi _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "some of the main characteristics of these samples are summarized in figure  [ fig : datasets ] . the sky distribution ( upper panels ) , redshifts ( central panels ) and peculiar velocities ( lower panels ) of the sfi and enear galaxies are quite similar , especially when accounting for the expected tighter spatial correlation and higher peculiar velocities of the enear early type galaxies .",
    "further evidence for the consistency of the two catalogs will be provided in section  [ sec : results ] ( _ e.g. _ , see figures  [ fig : density_compare ] and  [ fig : velocity_compare ] ) .",
    "the substantial number of galaxies and the large sky coverage ( the unobserved region is given by a zone of avoidance of about @xmath39 about the galactic - plane ) allow a dense and uniform sampling of the velocity field . moreover , since secat contains both early and late type galaxies , we can sample both high and low density regions and therefore minimize possible biases that might have affected other analyses based on a single population of objects .    to estimate",

    "for the first time the umv method provides a common methodological framework in which to perform velocity - velocity and density - density comparisons .",
    "the velocity - velocity comparison yields a value of @xmath4 consistent with that measured in the velmod and itf analyses .",
    "however , the value of the same parameter obtained from our density - density comparison is significantly smaller than those obtained from the potent analyses ( _ cf .",
    "_ , sigad _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 parameters from both @xmath118 and @xmath119 comparisons presented here are in agreement , yielding a @xmath120 with an estimated error of the order of @xmath57 .",
    "in contrast with the potent algorithm , the new umv method reconstructs the density field from peculiar velocities while taking into account their underlying correlation properties .",
    "the regularization aspect of the umv estimator significantly improves the stability of the inversion , which is especially important given the low signal - to - noise ratio of peculiar velocity data .",
    "the regularization obtained by this method is very similar to the one provided by the wiener filter method ( zaroubi _ et al .",
    ". however , the umv has been designed to provide an unbiased estimator of the underlying signal , a property that the wiener filtering method lacks .",
    "these two aspects make the umv estimator a very useful tool for reconstruction from peculiar velocity data .    in our error analysis",
    "we have shown that for the best fit value of @xmath4 the density and velocity residuals are normally distributed .",
    "this indicates that the psc@xmath0 density and velocity fields constitute an adequate model for those reconstructed with the umv estimator .",
    "the fields only differ by a monopole term , corresponding to a mismatch in the the mean density within @xmath121 which is caused by the known incompleteness of the psc@xmath0 catalog at faint fluxes ( teodoro _ et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "this also implies that the effect of the nonlinear dynamics and amount of nonlinear and stochastic biasing on the scales involved in our analysis is negligible relative to the measured peculiar velocity errors .",
    "the results presented in this paper are quite encouraging since for the first time the two ways of estimating the value of the @xmath4 parameter give a consistent result .",
    "our results also suggest that the umv estimator is a promising tool for the problem of reconstructing the dynamical fields from the observed radial peculiar velocities and therefore could be applied to other datasets .",

    "e.g. _ , sdss and large cluster surveys with kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich measurements .",
    "our present density - density comparison results are in marked contrast to those obtained by earlier work , including those from the recent analysis of the mark  iii catalog using the potent method ( _ e.g. _ , sigad _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) , and raises the question on the origin of this discrepancy",
    ". the mark iii catalog , as shown for example by davis _",
    "et al . _  ( 1996 ) and more recently by courteau _ et al . _  ( 2000 ) , suffers from systematic calibration errors that would cause a systematic error in the estimation of @xmath4 .",
    "however , these errors are not expected to overestimate the value of @xmath4 by more than a factor of two .",
    "an application of the umv method to the mark iii catalog shows that the obtained values of @xmath4 are somewhat higher than those obtained from the secat catalogs by @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath118-like velmod analysis yield consistent values of @xmath4 when applied to mark iii and sfi datasets ( willick _ et al . _ , 1997b , willick and strauss 1998 , branchini _ et al . _ , 2001 ) . based on these arguments , one could speculate that the most likely explanation to the inconsistent results is a conspiracy of both the systematics errors in mark iii and some noise - driven inversion instability in the potent reconstructions .",
