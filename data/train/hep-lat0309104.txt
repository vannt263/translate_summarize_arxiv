    "the studies of chiral symmetries on the lattice have made much progress recently .",

    "the second key , the `` admissibility '' condition eq .",

    "the gauge fields are classified by a topological charge which corresponds to that of the continuum theory , giving a well - defined chiral anomaly at the quantum level .    in two - dimensional qed",

    "we present a numerical study of two - dimensional qed with lscher s gauge action which satisfies admissibility condition automatically @xcite .",
    "we show that topological structure is realized on the lattice , @xmath0 dependence of observables can be evaluated by our new method . as a result",
    "we obtain the mass of isotriplet meson which is consistent with the continuum theory . this work may offer a new approach to investigate `` topology '' in the lattice gauge theories .",

    "as figs.[fig : pimass ] and [ fig : pitheta ] show , the fermion mass and @xmath0 dependence of the pion mass are consistent with that of continuum theory at small @xmath0 @xcite ; @xmath25    moreover , it is remarkable the residual mass in the chiral limit is consistent with zero within statistical error even in this strong coupling regime ; @xmath26",

    "we find that the lattice gauge fields are separated into topological sectors .",
    "our reweighting method enables the summation over topological sectors .",
