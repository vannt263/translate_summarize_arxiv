    "a _ number system _ is a coherent notation system for numbers .",
    "there are many possibilities to define such systems , but in this paper we will consider only generalisations of the _ positional _ number systems , like the binary and decimal notations . in such systems , one represents numbers by finite expansions of the form @xmath4 where the @xmath5 are taken from a finite set of digits , and @xmath0 is the _ base _ of the system . for example , taking for @xmath0 an integer greater than @xmath6 and using digits @xmath7 , we can represent all nonnegative integers in the form , and these representations are in fact unique .",
    "however , if we want to represent _ all integers _ in this form , we must change either the base or the digit set ; for example , we can take an integer base @xmath0 with @xmath8 , and digits @xmath9 , as proved already by grnwald in 1885 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to number systems within the set of integers .",
    "the basic definitions are then as follows .",
    "[ def1 ] a _ pre - number system _ in the ring of integers @xmath10 is given by an integer @xmath0 and a finite set of integers @xmath11 satisfying the following properties :    we have @xmath12 ;    the elements of @xmath11 cover all the cosets of integers modulo @xmath0 .",
    "the integer @xmath0 is called the _ base _ of the pre - number system , and @xmath11 is the _ digit set_. if @xmath13 , we say that @xmath11 is _ irredundant _ , otherwise it is _ redundant_. in an irredundant digit set , the unique digit that represents the coset of @xmath1 is called the _",
    "zero digit_.    a pre - number system @xmath14 is a _ number system _ if every @xmath15 has a _",
    "finite _ expansion of the form @xmath16 where all @xmath5 are in @xmath11 and where @xmath17 is a positive integer .    if @xmath14 is a number system , we call @xmath11 a _ valid digit set _ for @xmath0",
    ".    the notation @xmath14 for a pre - number system in @xmath10 is motivated by the fact that pre - number systems may be defined in much more general rings and other sets ( see the forthcoming paper @xcite ) , where instead of @xmath10 we indicate the set of numbers , or number - like elements , that we want to have a finite representation . in the present paper , however , all pre - number systems will be in @xmath10 .",
    "many generalisations of this definition are possible . already knuth ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.1 ) gave many interesting variants .",
    "for all variants where the basis remains integral in some sense , such as an algebraic integer or an integer matrix , we would like to refer to section 3 of the survey paper @xcite .",
    "it is possible to consider nonintegral bases ; this was done in @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3.3 ) , and @xcite .",
    "one could take a positive @xmath0 and nonnegative digits , and look only at the property of representing all _ nonnegative _ integers in the form ; here , a complete classification of all possible digit sets ( which must contain @xmath1 ) was achieved in @xcite , and generalisations to the higher - dimensional case are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there are interesting number systems that use redundant digit sets , such as those discussed in @xcite ; in the guise of addition chains , several such systems are useful for speeding up operations in elliptic curve cryptosystems ( see ( * ? ? ? * chapter 9 ) ) .",
    "virtually all papers dealing with number systems as defined above , or with their generalisations , have used the additional requirement that @xmath1 be in the digit set .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to explore the consequences when we drop this restriction , while remaining within the framework of definition [ def1 ] .",
    "we will discuss higher - dimensional generalisations in another paper @xcite .",
    "number systems without zero in the case where the base @xmath0 is a power of @xmath18 were proposed by mller for the purpose of avoiding side channel attacks in elliptic curve cryptography ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.4 ) and ( * ? ? ? * section 29.1.1.a ) ) .",
    "the basic implications of definition [ def1 ] will be discussed in section 2 .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is not a digit , we can not pad expansions with zeros if we want to make them longer ; we will be forced to use repetitions of some sequence of nonzero digits that nonetheless has zero value .",
    "we will show that such a sequence always exists , whenever we have a _ number system_. we also show that the length of such sequences goes to @xmath19 with the size of the _",
    "zero digit_. next , we construct a few basic examples of digit sets with without @xmath1 for any base @xmath0 . finally , we show that a valid digit set can not be translated over an arbitrarily large integer without losing the number system property , even if it contains @xmath1 and we leave the @xmath1 in place .    in section 3",
    ", we will prove the existence of infinitely many distinct sets of nonzero digits in @xmath10 for any integer base @xmath0 with @xmath20 , the main results being theorems [ thmavoid ] and [ thmavoidneg ] .",
    "this complements known results for digit sets that do have @xmath1 , which have been obtained by matula @xcite and kovcs and peth @xcite .    as for bases with @xmath21",
    ", we have a pre - number system if @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "now for @xmath24 , no digit set at all will yield a number system , whether including @xmath1 or not ; see corollary [ coronecycle ] for a proof . for @xmath3 , in section 4 we will characterise _ all _",
    "possible digit sets that yield a number system in @xmath10 ; although infinite in number , it will turn out that their structure is different from the infinite families obtained for larger bases in section 3 .",
    "the main result is theorem [ thmminus2 ] . for @xmath25 ,",
    "we have been unable to obtain the existence of infinitely many digit sets without zero , which therefore remains an open problem .",
    "we will now explore the consequences of not having @xmath1 as a digit in a number system .",
    "first , we extend some well known results and definitions to the more general context defined above ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 2.1 , 2.2 , 3.1 , and 3.2 ) and references therein for more background on these notions .",
    "let @xmath14 be a pre - number system .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we will assume that all digit sets are _",
    "irredundant_. it follows that , given @xmath26 , there exists a unique digit @xmath27 such that @xmath28 is divisible by @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , there will be a unique digit that is itself divisible by @xmath0 ; this is the digit corresponding to the integer @xmath1 , and , as in definition [ def1 ] , we will call it the _ zero digit _ , whether it be equal to @xmath1 or not .",

    "the name obviously comes from dynamical system theory ; this connection is given in more detail in @xcite .",

    "the considerations just given show that whether a given pre - number system has the number system property depends on the structure of the _ discrete dynamical system _ on @xmath10 given by the map @xmath31 .",
    "the characterisation given in theorem [ thmchar ] can be made into a finite algorithm for deciding the number system property , because the dynamical system just defined is contractive and therefore has a finite _ attractor set _",

    "the following theorem is the extension , to general digit sets , of the usual formulation that in a number system the attractor should contain just the element @xmath1 ( given as theorem 3 in @xcite ) .
