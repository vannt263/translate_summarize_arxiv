    "<S> modern electron scattering experiments have determined the proton electric form factor , @xmath0 , to high precision . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize this data , represented by the different empirical form factor parametrizations , to compute the third zemach moment of the proton charge distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we find that existing data rule out a value of the third zemach moment large enough to explain the current puzzle with the proton charge radius , determined from the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with the recent paper of de rjula . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the size of the third zemach moment is largely governed by the fourth moment of the conventional charge distributions , @xmath1 , which enables us to obtain a rigorous upper bound on the magnitude of the proton s third zemach moment .    </S>",
    "<S> pohl _ et al . </S>",

    "<S> even more recently de  rjula  @xcite pointed out that the discrepancy between the two results can be removed if the proton s third zemach moment is very large . </S>",
    "<S> he finds that a value of @xmath4 combines the impressive experimental results from the codata compilation and the recent muonic lamb shift data in a consistent manner . </S>",

    "<S> examination of the integrand in eq .   for each of the three form factor models </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , the third zemach moment is suppressed relative to the charge radius by a factor of @xmath32 , therefore the variation of the zemach moment observed in table  [ tab : res ] has negligible impact on the extracted value of the charge radius .    </S>",

    "<S> it is therefore apparent that if a model reproduces the proton charge radius , a large third zemach moment can only occur if @xmath45 is also large . </S>",

    "<S> the net result is that the published parametrizations , which take into account a wide variety of electron scattering data , can not account for the value of the third zemach moment found in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that further investigations of low @xmath28 data will lead to improved parametrizations for @xmath16  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , enhancing the zemach moment significantly above the dipole result is extremely unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the resolution of the current puzzle regarding the proton radius , determined from the muon and electron lamb shifts in hydrogen , lies in a direction other than that suggested by de rjula . </S>"
