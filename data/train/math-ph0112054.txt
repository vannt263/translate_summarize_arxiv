    ", did these authors note that `` uhlmann was probably the first to address the issue of mixed state holonomy , but as a purely mathematical problem '' .",
    "interested in possible ( previously uninvestigated ) relationships between the work of sjqvist _",
    "et al _ @xcite and that of uhlmann @xcite , the present author compared the two approaches in terms of two spin-@xmath5 scenarios @xcite . in the first of these ,",
    "the spin-@xmath5 systems undergo unitary evolution along geodesic triangles @xcite , while in the second the unitary evolution takes place along circular paths @xcite .",
    "in@xcite , uhlmann had also proposed an additional scenario , which was ( initially ) left unanalyzed in @xcite .",
    "it involves `` the gibbsian states of the form '' , @xmath6 which fill for a given value of @xmath7 a 2-sphere called @xmath8 if @xmath9 runs through all directions in 3-space .",
    "now , for the starting point of the unitary evolution , one sets @xmath10 , while @xmath11 is chosen as rotational axis .",
    "the curve of state evolution is given by @xmath12 and the associated parallel lift of this curve with initial value @xmath13 is @xmath14 where @xmath15 it is possible to regard @xmath16 as a rotation with angle @xmath17 and rotation axis @xmath18 the holonomy invariant can then be written as @xmath19 ( all the preceding equations are directly adopted from @xcite . )    in this paper , to begin , we compute the trace of this invariant ( [ hi ] ) for all @xmath20 .",
    "we plot the arguments of these traces , that is the corresponding geometric phases ( @xmath21 ) , in figs .",
    "[ g2 ] - [ g11 ] ( sec .",
    "[ r2 ] ) , and their absolute values , that is the visibilities ( @xmath22 ) , in figs .",
    "[ v2 ] - [ v11 ] ( sec .",
    "( for @xmath23 , the results are equivalent to the first ( non - gibbsian ) set of models in @xcite , which was compared with the analyses of sjqvist _",

    "let us note that the value @xmath24 corresponds to the fully mixed ( classical ) state , while @xmath25 correspond to pure states .    in sec .",
    "[ r4 ] , we compare certain aspects of these results _ across _ the ten distinct values of @xmath1 .",
    "all the various results up to this point can be considered as _ first - order _ in nature . in sec .",
    "[ r5 ] , on the other hand , we compute certain _ higher - order _ invariants . in secs .",
    "[ r6]-[rr0 ] , we perform analyses precisely analogous to those in secs .",
    "[ r2]-[r4 ] , but now in terms not of the approach of uhlmann to mixed state holonomy , but that of sjqvist _ et al _ @xcite . in our final analytical section ( sec .",
    "[ r8 ] ) , before the summary ( sec .",
    "[ r9 ] ) , we directly compare results obtained by the two different procedures .",
    "one of our main findings is that if one sets the implicit parameter @xmath3 in the uhlmann holonomy invariant ( [ hi ] ) to zero , then its resultant trace is simply equal to @xmath4 times the holonomy invariant ( * ? ? ?",

    "in the spin-@xmath5 case ( figs .  [ g2 ] and [ v2 ] ) , we have that the geometric phase @xmath26 is the arctangent of @xmath27 , taking into account which quadrant the point @xmath28 lies in , where @xmath29 also , the visibility in this spin-@xmath5 case is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is as defined in ( [ kap ] ) . the comparable results in the spin-1 case ( figs .

    "are similarly based on @xmath33 and @xmath34 one feature distinguishing the ( strikingly similar ) visibility plots ( figs .",

[ ve2 ] ) is the square root of @xmath52 ( in some of the later [ computationally - intensive ] figures in this section , it proved essentially necessary to omit the [ otherwise obvious ] axes labels , due to some quite distinct peculiarities of the graphics facilities for the local installation of mathematica on the more powerful workstations . )    in figs .",
    "[ ve3 ] and [ ve4 ] are shown the analogous quantities for gibbsian spin-1 systems .        to supplement our consideration above of the _ traces _ of various powers of the uhlmann holonomy invariant ( [ hi ] ) , here",

    "[ bv4 ] and [ bv6 ] , the absolute values of the two corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "the argument of the intermediate ( in absolute value ) one of the three eigenvalues appears to always be identically zero , that is , this intermediate eigenvalue is real ( fig .",
    "[ bv5 ] ) .",
    "it also appears numerically , on the basis of further analyses we have conducted , that this result is generalizable to the proposition that for odd @xmath1 , the central / most intermediate one ( that is , the @xmath55-th ) of the @xmath1 eigenvalues is real .",
    "( also , the centrally located diagonal entry of the holonomy invariant for odd @xmath1 appears to be real , in general . )    in figs .",

    "in the approach of sjqvist _ et al _ @xcite every pure state that diagonalizes the initial density matrix is parallel transported separately . by weighting the associated holonomy of each such pure state by the corresponding eigenvalues , we obtain the measure proposed in @xcite `` in the experimental context of quantum interferometry '' . since it is essentially trivial to obtain the pure states that diagonalize the _ initial _ ( diagonal ) @xmath1-level gibbsian density matrix and the associated eigenvalues , and since uhlmann has presented the holonomy invariant ( the trace of which is the berry phase ) @xmath58 for the circular evolution of pure states , we can directly compute the sjqvist _",

    "in figs .  [ z1]-[z5 ] , we display the direct counterparts of figs .",
    "[ s1]-[s5 ] , but now based on the methodology @xcite of sjqvist _ et al _ rather than uhlmann .",
    "( we omit the counterpart of fig .",
    "[ s6 ] because it appears to consist of essentially noise . )",
    "in fig .  [ o1 ] , we plot for @xmath65 the ratio of the sjqvist _ et al _ geometric phase ( fig .  [ k6 ] ) to the uhlmann geometric phase ( fig .",
    "[ g6 ] ) , and in fig .",
    "[ o2 ] , the corresponding ratio for @xmath66 . in the next two figures ( figs .",
    "[ o3 ] and [ o4 ] ) , we show the ratios of the associated visibililities .",
    "we have reported an in - depth study here of two different methodologies for determining geometric phases for _ mixed _ states @xcite . the analysis has been framed in terms of rotations ( @xmath0-orbits ) of @xmath1-level gibbsian systems , as originally proposed by uhlmann @xcite .",
    "there are , of course , many features in these results .",
    "one of these is that the sjqvist _ et al _ geometric phases ( sec .",
    "[ r6 ] ) appear to be less sensitive to the inverse temperature parameter ( @xmath7 ) than do the uhlmann geometric phases ( sec .",
    "[ r2 ] ) .    in particular , we have found ( sec .  [ r4 ] ) that as the number of levels of the gibbsian density matrices increases ( in the sample we have studied ) from @xmath49 to 11 , the uhlmann methodology often yields simple monotonic behavior .",
    "on the other hand , this seems to be largely absent using the sjqvist _",
    "et al _ methodology ( sec .  [ rr0 ] ) , which appears among other things to be sensitive to the bosonic ( odd @xmath1 ) or fermionic ( even @xmath1 ) character of the system under consideration ,    it is certainly important to note that if one sets the parameter @xmath3  given in ( [ aequation ] )  equal to zero in the approach of uhlmann ( sec .",
    "[ r1 ] ) , the resulting holonomy invariant ( [ hi ] ) is simply _ equal _ to @xmath4 times the holonomy invariant of sjqvist _",
    "et al _ ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 15 ) ) .",
    "this would appear to help to explain the added complexity of the plots of the uhlmann geometric phases ( sec .",
    "[ r2 ] ) vis -  - vis those of the sjqvist _",
    "et al _ plots ( sec .  [ r6 ] ) .",
    "we have found compelling numerical evidence that for odd @xmath1 the central ( @xmath55-th ) of the @xmath1 eigenvalues ( ordered in terms of absolute value ) of the uhlmann holonomy invariant ( [ hi ] ) is always a real number ( sec .",
    "[ reigen ] ) .",
    "( by the fundamental theorem of algebra , for odd @xmath1 , one of the @xmath1 eigenvalues must of course be real  since complex roots come in conjugate pairs  but clearly not necessarily the centrally located eigenvalue . ) also , the @xmath67-entry of the uhlmann holonomy invariant ( [ hi ] ) is itself real , for odd @xmath1 . in terms of absolute values ,",
    "the diagonal entries of the invariant ( [ hi ] ) appear to be always monotonically decreasing from the ( upper left ) ( 1,1)-entry to the ( lower right ) ( @xmath68)-entry .",
