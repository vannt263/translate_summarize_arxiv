    "the publication by lin & shu ( 1964 ) of a density wave theory of spiral structure generated wide interest , and has led to a broad literature .",
    "one strand of that literature consists of stellar dynamic studies of the instabilities of flat stellar systems .",
    "important ingredients of the analysis of lin & shu are the approximations of tight  winding , or near  axisymmetry , of the waves , and of the near  circularity of the stellar orbits of the unperturbed disk .",
    "a key result obtained using these approximations is that of toomre ( 1964 ) who showed that the stability of stellar disks to axisymmetric waves requires that the parameter @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the epicyclic frequency , @xmath3 is the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath4 is the disk density , and @xmath5 is the gravitational constant .",
    "this result has proved to be remarkably robust and widely applicable , despite the simplifying approximations used in its derivation .",
    "yet it was soon recognized that toomre s criterion does not provide a complete stability criterion for stellar disks when @xmath6body experiments ( miller , prendergast & quirk 1970 , hohl 1971 , ostriker & peebles 1973 ) revealed that disks with @xmath7 safely greater than @xmath8 are prone to large  scale barlike instabilities .",
    "kalnajs ( 1971,1977 ) developed the matrix method for using linear perturbation theory to study the stability of stellar systems .",
    "his method is quite general and does not impose any restrictions on the forms of either the instability , or the unperturbed stellar orbits .",
    "the matrix method is sufficiently complex that it has not been widely used , though that is gradually changing .",
    "the first comprehensive study using it was that of zang ( 1976 ) who analyzed the instabilities of scale  free singular isothermal disks . some of the results of his phd thesis are given in papers by his supervisor ( toomre 1977 , 1981 ) .",
    "zang s methods were re - used and extended by evans & read ( 1998a , b ) who analyzed singular scale ",
    "free disks with other power  law rotation laws . scale ",
    "free disks have the property that the orbits at any energy are simply scaled versions of those at any other energy .",
    "though this is indeed a simplification , even applications of the matrix method to scale  free disks are by no means simple .",
    "we study stellar disks with smooth and non  singular cores .",
    "one of the main purposes of our work is to understand the influence that orbital populations have on the responses of the disks to density perturbations , by studying the responses of a variety of disks . that variety allow us to study the effects of the mass and extent of the disk , the orbital population , and a central bulge . in  [ sec::linear - pert - theory ] we use the matrix method to derive the eigenvalue problem whose outcome is the pattern speed , growth rate and mode shape of an unstable galactic disk .",
    "we show in  [ sec::boundary - integrals ] that a boundary integral , which has been unjustifiably ignored in some earlier work , may occur with unidirectional disks . in  [ sec::angularmomentumenergy ] we extend the linear perturbation theory to second order .",
    "those results are needed for studying how modes transfer angular momentum and potential and kinetic energy . in  [ sec::p04theory ]",
    "we discuss polyachenko s ( 2004 ) simplified theory of spiral and bar  like modes . in later sections",
    "we compare our findings with its predictions .",
    "we introduce the three axisymmetric potentials which we use for our models in  [ sec::our - models ] .",
    "they are those of kuzmin s disk , the isochrone disk , and the cored logarithmic potential .",
    "we use known distribution functions ( dfs ) for stellar disks with the first two potentials .",
    "however , none are currently available for cored exponential disks embedded in the cored logarithmic potential , and so we construct some dfs for them in ",
    "[ subsec::df - exponential ] .",
    "lastly in  [ subsec::bulges ] we discuss a way to model the effects of hot central bulges by modifying dfs by cutting out a part of their orbital population .",
    "we describe our computational procedures in  [ sec::computational - procedures ] . in  [ sec::numresults ] we give the results of our computations of modes of angular wavenumber @xmath9 obtained using the matrix method .",
    "some of our models are new , while others are the same as those studied in prior work .",
    "the prior work , some of which was done using carefully applied @xmath6body simulations , includes that of kalnajs ( 1978 ) , earn & sellwood ( 1995 ) and pichon & cannon ( 1997 ) for the isochrone potential , and that of athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) , sellwood & athanassoula ( 1986 ) , hunter ( 1992 ) , and pichon & cannon ( 1997 ) for kuzmin s potential .",
    "vauterin & dejonghe ( 1996 ) studied modes of a cored exponential disk , like that we use in  [ subsec::expdisk_in_coredlog ] , in a potential with a nearly flat rotation curve , which they obtained by combining two kuzmin potentials .",
    "sellwood ( 1989 ) studied modes of the uncored and mildly singular exponential disk in the same cored logarithmic potential as we use for our models in ",

    "we derive a matrix eigenvalue problem for finding modes , following kalnajs ( 1971,1977 ) .",
    "we apply this analysis to unidirectional disks in which all stars circulate in the same direction in ",
    "[ sec::boundary - integrals ] , and show that the matrix formulation must then include additional boundary integral terms .",
    "we extend the perturbation theory to second order in  [ sec::angularmomentumenergy ] to the extent necessary for discussing the transfer of angular momentum , and kinetic and potential energy . in  [ sec::p04theory ] we discuss orbits and their responses , and relate the analysis of  [ sec::linear - pert - theory ] to polyachenko s ( 2004 ) theory .",
    "we study the stability of a collisionless stellar disk composed of a distribution of stars moving in orbits in a circularly symmetric potential @xmath10 .",

    "equation ( [ eq::poisson - eq ] ) is true when @xmath25 because we shall use @xmath26 to denote the self - consistent density for the potential @xmath27 .",
    "equation ( [ eq::sigmadisk ] ) replaces the @xmath25 case of equation ( [ eq::first - moment - eq ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to work with the action variables of the unperturbed motion , defined by @xmath28 the first equation here defines @xmath29 as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the actions provide an alternative pair of integrals of motion , in terms of which we can express the unperturbed df @xmath32 and hamiltonian @xmath33 .",
    "the advantage of using action variables is that their conjugate angle variables @xmath34 increase uniformly with time @xmath35 perturbations must be periodic in the angles , and this allows us to use fourier series in these angles for them ( kalnajs 1971 ) .",
    "it is convenient to write these fourier series in the complex form @xmath36 with the understanding that it is their real parts which give the physical solution . following landau ( 1946 )",
    ", we suppose that the frequency @xmath37 is complex with real and imaginary parts @xmath38 with @xmath39 representing an angular pattern speed and @xmath40 a growth rate .",
    "we suppose initially that @xmath41 so that we have a growing disturbance which was infinitesimally small infinitely long ago .",
    "the possibility of stationary oscillations and real values of @xmath37 has to be considered via analytical continuation to @xmath42 from @xmath41 .",
    "the solutions ( [ eq::expansion - f ] ) and ( [ eq::expansion - v ] ) are those for a perturbation of a single angular wavenumber @xmath43 .",
    "perturbations of all angular wavenumbers are possible and could be considered ( kalnajs 1971 , lynden - bell & kalnajs 1972 ) but we forgo that generality .",
    "different wavenumbers do not interact at the first order when as here , the unperturbed state is axisymmetric .",
    "in fact we shall be concerned almost entirely with the case of @xmath9 .",
    "substituting expansions ( [ eq::expansion - f ] ) and ( [ eq::expansion - v ] ) into equation ( [ eq::boltzmann - equationone ] ) and matching fourier coefficients yields the relation @xmath44 the potential @xmath45 , and the density @xmath46 which causes it and is obtained from integrating @xmath47 as in equation ( [ eq::first - moment - eq ] ) , can also be expanded in position space as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are a complete set of real basis functions , and @xmath51 are constant coefficients .",

    "alternatively , we can rewrite @xmath46 using its integral ( [ eq::first - moment - eq ] ) , and then carry out the integration over phase space using action and angle variables .",

    ". modes with @xmath75 are therefore precluded when @xmath76 .",
    "more generally , this special component of the boundary integral can be incorporated into an iterative scheme for computing eigenvalues , which we describe in  [ sec::eigenvaluesearch ] .",
    "the df ( [ eq::sharp - cut - df ] ) also drops abruptly to zero at the circular orbit limit @xmath77 so that one should also include an extra @xmath78 factor in the df .",
    "differentiation of @xmath79 with respect to @xmath77 then gives a @xmath80 .",
    "however it gives no boundary integral , regardless of the value of @xmath79 at @xmath77 .",
    "the reason is that its integrand , for which the @xmath81 of equation ( [ eq::msupb - elements ] ) is replaced by @xmath82 , vanishes at @xmath77 .",
    "that is because the fourier coefficients @xmath83 vanish for all @xmath84 because orbits with @xmath77 are circular , and the remaining non - zero @xmath85 fourier coefficient is annulled by the factor @xmath86 .",
    "hence the simpler form ( [ eq::sharp - cut - df ] ) of the df suffices .",
    "the boundary integral ( [ eq::msupb - elements ] ) does not arise if the unperturbed df contains no radial orbits so that @xmath87 .",
    "this is the case for the unidirectional dfs used by zang ( 1976 ) and evans & read ( 1998a , b ) because their dfs contain positive powers of @xmath88 as factors , and hence contain no radial orbits .",
    "they work with scalefree potentials which are singular as @xmath89 , whereas ours are not .",
    "only orbits with low angular momenta penetrate near the center of a cored potential . as gerhard ( 1991 ) discusses for the analogous problem of spherical systems , most dfs for smooth potentials which produce finite densities in their cores tend to isotropy there and so have radial orbits .",
    "his reasoning applies to thin disks too .",
    "only orbits with low angular momenta penetrate near the center , and the only alternative to radial orbits is a singular distribution of non - radial orbits , as when all orbits are circular . the need for radial orbits to provide a non ",
    "zero central density disappears if the density of the stellar disk drops to zero in the center , as it does with the cutouts which we discuss in  [ subsec::bulges ] .",
    "the omission of the boundary integral terms ( [ eq::msupb - elements ] ) in the cases computed by hunter ( 1992 ) invalidates his results . as we shall see in ",
    "[ subsec::example - kuz - disk ] , the effect is substantial . pichon & cannon ( 1997 ) confirmed those results , but only because they repeated hunter s error of neglecting the boundary integral .",
    "as we show in appendix [ app::lagrangian ] , its omission means neglecting the contributions to potential energy and angular momentum which arise from the perturbation of radial orbits .",
    "boundary integrals are avoided if one uses a lagrangian instead of an eulerian perturbation theory ( kalnajs 1977 ) .",
    "the two forms of the theory are complementary and we show in appendix [ app::lagrangian ] that the lagrangian results relevant to this work can be derived simply from the eulerian theory .",
    "the perturbations to angular momentum and energy are of second order , and so their calculation requires considering the second order terms from ( [ eq::boltzmann - equationtwo ] ) . summing the contributions from all elements in phase space gives @xmath90 for the total angular momentum , and @xmath91 for the total kinetic energy . to compute the gravitational energy",
    ", we must distinguish between the part @xmath92 of the unperturbed gravitational potential @xmath27 which is due to the stars of the disk , and the remainder @xmath93 which is provided by some other and external source .",
    "the perturbational terms @xmath94 , @xmath95 , of the potential all arise from the perturbed df , and so all belong to the self - gravitational potential .",
    "the double contribution of the external potential to the gravitational energy is taken care of by writing it as @xmath96 the leading corrections to these quantities due to the perturbations are of second order because all the first order terms vanish when integrated over @xmath97 .",
    "they are @xmath98 after using the zeroth order part of equation ( [ eq::hamiltonian ] ) to substitute for the velocities , and , because @xmath99 , @xmath100 the component @xmath101 because their defining integrals match .",
    "the step to the second line of equation ( [ eq::wtwo ] ) uses the fact that the first and third terms on the first line cancel .",
    "this is seen by transforming the integrations to @xmath102 space , and then using equations ( [ eq::sigmadisk ] ) , ( [ eq::first - moment - eq ] ) for @xmath103 , and poisson integrals like ( [ eq::poisson - eq ] ) to relate potentials to densities , to express them as identical integrals of the product of the densities @xmath4 and @xmath104 .",
    "the simplest integral to calculate is that for the first component of @xmath105 in equation ( [ eq::wtwo ] ) .",
    "as we noted earlier , the physical parts of our solutions are given by the real parts of our complex solutions .",
    "the real parts of @xmath47 and @xmath45 are given by the sums @xmath106 and @xmath107 , where a bar denotes a complex conjugate .",
    "therefore @xmath108 where the components @xmath109 are defined by @xmath110|\\tilde v_{l}|^2         \\over |l\\omega _ r+m\\omega _ { \\phi } -\\omega|^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have used here , and will again , the fact that the only products which do not vanish on integration over @xmath97 are those which pair a conjugate with a non - conjugate quantity .",
    "we show in appendix [ app::angmomenergy ] that @xmath111 where the components of these sums are defined by the integrals @xmath112 to each of the area integrals ( [ eq::w_2_1_ell ] ) , ( [ eq::l_2_ell ] ) and ( [ eq::k_2_1_ell ] ) must be added the boundary integrals given by the delta function term of equation ( [ eq::sharp - cut - dfderiv ] ) for the prograde df ( [ eq::sharp - cut - df ] ) .",
    "the integrals can be combined to give the simple relation @xmath113 between the separate components . although each of these components can be found directly from the first order solution , computing @xmath101 requires more , as we show in appendix [ app::angmomenergy ] .",
    "the second order corrections @xmath114 and @xmath105 to the angular momentum and gravitational energy have simple representations in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the matrix @xmath115 . combining equations ( [ eq::l_2_ell ] ) and ( [ eq::w_2_1_ell ] ) with expansion ( [ eq::expansion - coeffs - of - hamiltonian ] ) ,",
    "we get the quadratic forms @xmath116 where the superscript @xmath117 denotes transposition of the column vector @xmath64 to generate a row vector .",
    "these expressions are real because the matrix @xmath118 is symmetric .",
    "moreover multiplying equation ( [ eq::matrix - equation ] ) by @xmath119 and separating real and imaginary parts ( @xmath120 is also symmetric ) gives @xmath121 the second relation shows that @xmath122 , which it must be because the disk is not subject to any external torques , and hence its angular momentum is conserved .",
    "there is no such restriction on sizes of the separate fourier components represented by the terms for different @xmath86 in the sum ( [ eq::ltwo ] ) , other than that they must sum to zero .",
    "similarly the sizes of the different components of the potential and kinetic energy vary , because only the total energy @xmath123 is constrained to be zero , with @xmath124 . hence the two components of the kinetic and potential energy are related in the same way : @xmath125 the fact that the second order components grow twice as fast as those of first order is not paradoxical .",
    "it reflects the fact that our analysis can describe only the early stages of the growth of an instability .",
    "if we introduce a small ordering parameter @xmath126 into our expansion @xmath127 of the df to measure the size of the perturbation relative to that of the unperturbed state , then we see that the linearization breaks down , and our analysis is unreliable , after a time @xmath128 such that @xmath129 .",
    "the second order components are then of magnitude @xmath130 , which is also @xmath131 .",
    "our perturbation theory has then ceased to be valid .",
    "it is useful only when our expansion is well - ordered , that is for times for which @xmath132 is small .",
    "every orbit in a disk with an axisymmetric potential is a rosette ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "one extreme case is that of circular orbits with the maximum angular momentum @xmath133 for the energy @xmath30 .",
    "they have no radial motion and their radial action @xmath77 .",
    "the other extreme is that of radial orbits with zero angular momentum @xmath68 . for them",
    "the polar angle @xmath134 remains constant , except for discontinuous changes by @xmath135 whenever the orbit passes through the center .",
    "intermediate orbits oscillate in @xmath136 between maximum and minimum orbital radii @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an orbital frequency space for prograde orbits .",
    "its shape is characteristic of those of other cored potentials .",
    "the upper curved boundary is formed by circular orbits for which @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the circular velocity at radius @xmath136 , and @xmath141 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "the straight lower boundary is formed by radial orbits for which @xmath142 .",
    "the slimness of the region in between these boundaries , where all the intermediate orbits lie , shows how limited is the range of @xmath143 for all orbits .",
    "the frequency @xmath144 and its narrow range has long been recognized as dynamically important ( lindblad 1959 ) . lynden - bell ( 1979 ) pointed out that the response of an orbit to a weak bar - like potential , which rotates with a pattern speed @xmath145 for which @xmath146 is small , is to align the orbit with the bar if @xmath147 decreases as @xmath68 decreases when @xmath148 , the action corresponding to the frequency @xmath147 , is fixed .",
    "this is the case when @xmath149 lynden - bell labeled such orbits as abnormal , as opposed to normal or donkey orbits which respond contrarily to a bar - like force .",
    "it is straightforward to classify orbits in any potential according to the criterion ( [ eq::abnormalcondition ] ) ; abnormal orbits are those which lie below the dashed lines in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "all sufficiently radial orbits are abnormal , but so too are all orbits which remain in the central regions of cored potentials .",
    "the dividing curve for the cored logarithmic potential in figure [ fig4 ] tends to the asymptote @xmath150 as @xmath151 ( see  [ subsec::p04results ] ) .",
    "that asymptote , which is barely evident due to the compressed scale at high energies , is the dividing curve between normal and abnormal orbits for the singular logarithmic potential at all energies .",
    "polyachenko ( 2004 ) has outlined a unified theory of spiral and bar - like modes of disk galaxies based on lynden - bell s ( 1979 ) analysis .",
    "the analytical basis of his theory is a simplified version of the analysis given in  [ sec::dynamical - theory ] .",
    "he uses the smallness of @xmath146 to deduce that , to leading order , the perturbed df is given by a single @xmath74 component of the fourier series ( [ eq::expansion - f ] ) so that , in our notation , @xmath152 }                \\tilde f_{-m/2}(j_r , j_{\\phi}).\\ ] ] polyachenko s equation ( 11 ) relates the perturbed df to its potential when averaged over the ` fast ' angle @xmath153 . that averaged potential is given in our notation by the single @xmath74 component of the fourier series ( [ eq::expansion - v ] ) .",
    "polyachenko s equation ( 11 ) is therefore equivalent to the relation @xmath154 he has a different method for solving his equation ( 11 ) which has the advantage that he is able to derive a linear eigenvalue problem for @xmath37 , albeit one which must be solved for an unknown function of the two action variables .",
    "equation ( [ eq::simplefouriermatch ] ) shows that his method is equivalent to the kalnajs matrix formulation when that formulation is simplified by replacing the sum over @xmath86 in the coefficient equation ( [ eq::matrix - elements ] ) by the single @xmath74 term , or just the @xmath155 term in the important @xmath9 case .",
    "hence the matrix method can be applied to check the accuracy and validity of polyachenko s approximations by comparing its results with those obtained when only the @xmath155 terms of the matrix @xmath156 are used .",

    "those uninterested in these topics should skip to  [ sec::numresults ] where we present the results of our computations .",

    "for instance , the frequencies which pichon & cannon ( 1997 ) computed for a kuzmin s disk truncated at @xmath243 differ little from those computed by hunter ( 1992 ) who did not truncate them",

    "we normalize @xmath64 so as to make the positive and negative components of @xmath334 sum to @xmath335 respectively .",
    "we find that @xmath336 is always positive .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that all modes release gravitational energy and convert it to kinetic energy .",
    "such a release occurs only if the sum of the two components @xmath337 is positive .",

    "the frequencies of the fundamental modes for the self - consistent ( @xmath342 ) models listed in table [ table1 ] differ substantially from those given earlier by hunter ( 1992 ) and pichon & cannon ( 1997 ) .",
    "those results are incorrect because they omit the boundary integral @xmath261 .",
    "the difference is considerable .",
    "neglecting @xmath261 gives a pattern speed of @xmath343 with @xmath344 and a growth rate of @xmath345 for @xmath346 .",
    "the true fundamental mode of the @xmath346 model is the compact and rapidly growing central bar shown in figure [ fig6]_a _ , much more compact than that shown in figure 11 of pichon & cannon .",
    "the amplitude @xmath321 of its perturbed density in figure [ fig6]_c _ has a single peak .",
    "the secondary mode , shown in the right panels of figure [ fig6 ] , is slower growing and slower propagating .",

    "we show in  [ subsec::barcharts ] how the forms of the bar charts can be understood in terms of the formulae we derived in  [ sec::angularmomentumenergy ] .",
    "every bar chart shows that a few fourier components are significant for most of the transfer of angular momentum and energy .    the second block of results in table [ table1 ] are for unidirectional miyamoto models from which low angular momentum orbits have been removed by applying the cutout function ( [ eq::ourcutout ] ) with @xmath351 .",
    "this removal reduces the active surface density @xmath352 so that it tends to zero in the center , as shown in the dashed curve in figure [ fig7]_c _ , but does not introduce a sharp barrier .",
    "it reduces the active mass @xmath353 of the disk by a little more than 10% , but has a much larger effect on the modes , and especially the fundamental mode .",
    "the left panels of figure [ fig7 ] show the large changes in the fundamental mode of the @xmath346 miyamoto model caused by the @xmath351 cutout .",

    "its bar chart is totally different from that of figure [ fig6]_e _ , but similar to that of figure [ fig14]_e _ , which is for another fundamental mode of a cutout disk .",
    "the @xmath155 components are small , and the flow of angular momentum and @xmath336 is from the @xmath355 components , primarily @xmath85 , and to the @xmath356 components , primarily @xmath357 .",
    "the cutting - out of low angular momentum orbits and some 10% of the mass reduces the growth rate of the fundamental mode by such a large factor that it is no longer the fastest growing mode . the secondary mode , which is now the fastest growing , is not shown because it is changed much less .",
    "it has a similar but smoother spiral shape than that of figure [ fig6]_b _ , and extends just beyond the now  larger cr circle .",
    "the two humps of its amplitude @xmath321 are displaced outwards from those of figure [ fig6]_d _ , and the inner hump , which lies in a region of large mass reduction , is diminished .",
    "the outer hump , now at @xmath358 , lies in a region where the mass reduction is smaller .",
    "hence the reason why the cutout affects the fundamental mode so much more than the secondary mode is that it has a much larger effect on the more central orbits which are the major participants in the fundamental mode than it does on those of the secondary mode . because the ratio @xmath359 for the both modes of the cutout @xmath346 model , both induce a transfer from kinetic to gravitational energy .    the results for higher @xmath339 are similar .",
    "the cutout increases the pattern speeds of fundamental modes so much that none have crs .",
    "it decreases the pattern speeds of secondary modes , though not enough for there to be ilrs , which are possible only when @xmath360 .",
    "all growth rates are decreased , though the fundamental mode is still , though barely , the faster growing for @xmath351 and @xmath361 . as @xmath339 increases and orbits become more circular , the relative amount of angular momentum absorbed by the @xmath357 component of secondary modes increases .",

    "that value is still significantly less than the @xmath422 which efstathiou , lake & negroponte ( 1982 ) found to be necessary for their @xmath6body experiments , but that larger value may well be necessary for nonlinear stability .",
    "we analyze and explain the properties of the bar charts in  [ subsec::barcharts ] , and discuss the implications of our findings for polyachenko s ( 2004 ) simplified theory in  [ subsec::p04results ] .",
    "the rate of change of the perturbed angular momentum ( [ eq::dltwodt ] ) contains a factor @xmath423 , which tends to @xmath424 $ ] as @xmath425 . as lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 ) note , this implies that a neutrally stable wave emits and absorbs angular momentum only at resonances . for the unstable modes we discuss , the factor @xmath426 peaks at resonances , sharply so when @xmath40 is small .",
    "this peaking implies that emission and absorption occurs mainly near resonances .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that , for given pattern speed @xmath427 , the orbits associated with @xmath428 resonances lie at successively smaller values of the orbital frequencies @xmath387 and @xmath388 , and hence successively further out in the disk .",
    "that is the reason for interpreting the flows of angular momentum , and also kinetic energy , which are proportional to the quantities shown in the bar charts , as outward flows .",
    "it is evident from equations ( [ eq::w_2_1_ell ] ) , ( [ eq::l_2_ell ] ) , and ( [ eq::k_2_1_ell ] ) that the partial derivatives @xmath429 and @xmath430 play a major role in determining the signs of the fourier components shown in the bar charts .",
    "all the other terms in @xmath332 are either magnitudes or constants .",
    "lynden - bell & kalnajs argued that both derivatives are negative for a physically reasonable df .",
    "if this is so , then equation ( [ eq::l_2_ell ] ) shows that @xmath431 for @xmath348 .",
    "the compensating negative values of @xmath332 , necessary because there is no net change of angular momentum , can and must occur for @xmath347 .",
    "the fact that @xmath432 is negative , as we find , can be accounted for by @xmath433 being much larger than @xmath434 .",
    "the prediction matches the standard pattern we find in  [ sec::numresults ] .",
    "the assumptions that @xmath435 and @xmath436 are generally valid .",
    "figure 6 of kalnajs ( 1976b ) gives examples ; the contours of the two unidirectional dfs shown there decrease much more rapidly with increasing @xmath29 than with @xmath68 .",
    "however the modified @xmath437 models of  [ subsec::example - kuz - disk ] are exceptional because they have regions in which @xmath438 , and hence @xmath439 , are positive .",
    "though positive values of @xmath429 are unusual , positive values of @xmath440 are not .",
    "they are unavoidable with disks which are totally , or mostly , unidirectional .",
    "if @xmath87 , as it is for the unidirectional models of zang ( 1976 ) and evans & read ( 1998a ) and our cutout disks , then @xmath440 must be positive for some positive values of @xmath68 because otherwise @xmath32 could never become positive for @xmath441 .",
    "similarly @xmath442 must be positive for some @xmath443 for the tapered models of table [ table2 ] .",
    "furthermore the explicit formula ( [ eq::isoretrodf ] ) shows that @xmath444 for @xmath445 for the isochrone models of  [ subsec::example - kiso - disk ] . although no positive values of @xmath440 are visible in figure 6 of kalnajs ( 1976b ) , these are disks for which the boundary integral latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq::l_2_ellb } -m^2\\pi^2\\int { \\rm d } j_r \\left[{f_0^p(j_r,0)|\\tilde v_{l}|^2 \\over    then be included in the expression for @xmath332 .",
    "it is negative for every @xmath86 , as are the contributions to the integral ( [ eq::l_2_ell ] ) from positive values of @xmath440 .",
    "unidirectional disks for which @xmath447 can be regarded as @xmath448 limits of tapered disks ; the boundary integral ( [ eq::l_2_ellb ] ) then accounts for the effect of the large positive values of @xmath442 which occur in the taper .    despite the occurrence of regions of positive values of @xmath440 ,",
    "they are generally either too small , or confined to too limited regions , to modify the standard bar chart pattern . however , cutout disks have central regions in which @xmath440 is large and positive .",
    "that is the reason for the negative values of @xmath449 in the barcharts of figures [ fig7]_e _ and [ fig14]_e _ for fundamental modes of cutout disks .",
    "the bar charts for the secondary modes of these cutout disks have the standard form , as is seen in figure [ fig14]_f_. this is because @xmath450 for the more distant orbits which are the more important for the secondary mode .",
    "integral ( [ eq::k_2_1_ell ] ) for @xmath333 differs from integral ( [ eq::l_2_ell ] ) for @xmath332 by a factor @xmath451 .",
    "this is positive for @xmath452 for all direct orbits , but negative for @xmath453 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) , and is the reason why the signs of @xmath333 match those of @xmath332 for @xmath452 , but are their opposites for @xmath453 .",
    "this pattern holds even for the exceptional cases , with the result that @xmath333 is positive for all @xmath86 , except for @xmath155 in standard bar charts and @xmath85 in our exceptional ones .",
    "integral ( [ eq::w_2_1_ell ] ) for @xmath109 differs from that for @xmath332 by a factor @xmath454 .",
    "this factor is positive for all orbits for @xmath85 modes when the pattern speed @xmath455 , which is why @xmath456 is negative like @xmath449 for the exceptional fundamental modes .",
    "@xmath456 and @xmath449 otherwise have opposite signs for other modes with slower pattern speeds and @xmath457 , and which are dominated by orbits within cr .",
    "in fact @xmath109 is negative for all @xmath86 in all bar charts .",
    "this is explained by noting that @xmath454 is negative for modes which lie principally within olr for @xmath356 , and positive for @xmath458 , so that the signs of @xmath109 are respectively the opposite and the same as those of @xmath332 .",
    "a striking feature of the bar charts is the rapidity with which the quantities displayed there decrease with increasing @xmath459 .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "one is the increase in the denominators of their integrands in the regions where most orbits lie .",
    "the @xmath155 terms are generally important , even though there is no ilr , because the denominator term @xmath460 is never large for any orbit .",
    "another reason is the decay of the fourier coefficients @xmath461 with increasing @xmath459 .",
    "tables [ table1 ] through [ table4 ] show consistently that eigenvalues estimated using polyachenko s simplified theory are lower than those calculated from the full matrix theory . pattern speeds @xmath145 well exceed the narrow range of @xmath147 values which the cored potentials considered here allow , and so his basic assumption of small @xmath146 is then not valid .",
    "our bar charts show clearly that a few fourier components other than @xmath155 are always significant . the orbits which participate in the unstable modes that we find are predominantly abnormal in the sense defined by lynden - bell ( 1979 ) because all sufficiently central , as well as more radial , orbits are abnormal .",
    "in fact even circular orbits are normal only for @xmath462 for kuzmin s disk , @xmath463 for the isochrone , and @xmath464 for the cored logarithmic potential ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "our modes lie primarily within these limits .",
    "a quite different situation arises with the scale - free potentials @xmath465 for @xmath466 , and @xmath467 for @xmath468 , studied by evans & read ( 1998a , b ) .",
    "even central orbits can then be normal because the normal / abnormal classification then depends solely on the ratio @xmath469 , and is independent of energy .",
    "lynden - bell s criterion ( [ eq::abnormalcondition ] ) is satisfied , and an orbit abnormal , if @xmath470 ^ 2 f^{\\prime\\prime}(y)- \\nonumber \\\\ & { } & \\left[\\frac{2-\\alpha}{2+\\alpha}\\right ] \\left[f^{\\prime}(y)+\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right]^2   \\left[f(y)-yf^{\\prime}(y)\\right]>0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the function @xmath471 and depends also on @xmath288 .",
    "its derivative @xmath472 , where @xmath473 is the function defined and analyzed in touma & tremaine ( 1997 ) .",
    "the criterion ( [ eq::scalefreeabnormalcondition ] ) gives @xmath474 for the scalefree logarithmic potential , so that all the more circular orbits with large @xmath475 are normal .",
    "for @xmath476 and a falling rotation curve , there is a wide range of normal orbits , and only orbits with @xmath477 are abnormal . for @xmath478 and a rising rotation curve , only nearly circular orbits are normal , and all those with @xmath479 are abnormal .",
    "all orbits are abnormal for @xmath480 .",
    "interestingly evans & read , who looked specifically at the cases of @xmath481 , found that unstable modes grow more vigorously for the rising rotation curve case of @xmath478 with many abnormal orbits .",
    "ilrs occur with their modes because the range of @xmath147 is unbounded for scale - free potentials .",
    "this paper develops the theory of modes in thin stellar disks .",
    "it then implements that theory for a selection of disks .",
    "the theory basically is that pioneered by kalnajs ( 1971,1977 ) .",
    "our development of its eulerian form to second order is new .",
    "the expressions for angular momentum and total energy were given earlier by kalnajs ( 1971 ) and lynden - bell & kalnajs ( 1972 ) , but the expressions for the two separate components are new .",
    "the boundary integral terms which must be included in the method are also new .",
    "these integrals are avoided when a lagrangian form of the theory is used .",
    "the lagrangian form leads to more complicated computations , which is why prior computational work , except for that of vandervoort ( 1999 ) , has all been done for using the eulerian form .",
    "we show in appendix [ app::lagrangian ] how the passage from the lagrangian to the eulerian form allows us to interpret the boundary integrals as boundary fluxes .",
    "this analysis does not apply to the quite different version of lagrangian theory which vandervoort uses .",
    "our applications of the theory are to @xmath9 modes in potentials with smooth cores . in all but one case ( see table [ table2 ] ) , our search has found two modes , a centrally concentrated fundamental mode with a single peak in amplitude , and a more extensive and more spiral secondary mode with at least two peaks",
    ". there may be others .",
    "we find that the shape , pattern speed , and growth rate of the fundamental mode are especially sensitive to the relatively small proportion of orbits which provide the density in central regions because they have low angular momentum .",
    "the growth rate of the fundamental mode is reduced substantially , and its shape becomes more extensive and spiral , if those orbits are either removed or reversed .",
    "removing them increases the pattern speed , while reversing them decreases it . removing them also makes the more extensive and more spiral secondary mode the faster growing in all but one of the cases in tables [ table1 ] and [ table4 ] .",
    "this sensitivity to orbits , many of which are near radial , might suggest a connection with the phenomenon of _ radial orbit instability_. however that phenomenon , reviewed recently in merritt ( 1999 ) , occurs in hot anisotropic spherical stellar systems in which radial orbits are sufficiently predominant .",
    "the sensitivity we find here arises even with cool stellar systems with few near radial orbits .    with two exceptions ,",
    "modes are largely confined within the cr circle , but are too fast for there to be any orbits in ilr .",
    "the lack on an ilr means that modes can propagate into , and be reflected from , the center of the disk , even in cases in which our densities drop to zero there .",
    "the modes are unstable , sometimes rapidly so , as swing - amplifier theory ( toomre 1981 ) predicts .",
    "we have achieved stability only by decreasing the active mass of the disk . in the exceptional cases ,",
    "the modes lie within the olr circle , and the pattern speeds are then too fast for any orbits to be in cr .",
    "all the unstable modes transfer angular momentum and kinetic energy outwards , and most release gravitational energy and convert it to kinetic energy .",
    "this flow of angular momentum and energy is derived from the second order extension of a linear theory , and so can describe only the early stages of the growth of an instability , and not its later fully nonlinear development .",
    "only a few fourier components account for almost all of the angular momentum and energy .",
    "polyachenko s ( 2004 ) theory , which is equivalent to ignoring all but one term of our fourier development , seems to be an oversimplification .    this work has been supported in part by the national science foundation through grant dms-0104751 .",
