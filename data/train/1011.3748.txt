    "air shower simulations are a very powerful tool to interpret ground based cosmic ray experiments . however , most simulations are still based on hadronic interaction models more than 10 years old .",
    "much has been learned since , in particular due to new data available from the sps and rhic accelerators .    in this paper , we discuss the new development of the  model , the latter one being a hadronic interaction model , which does very well compared to rhic data  @xcite , and also other particle physics experiments ( especially sps experiments at cern ) . used for air shower analysis since 2006 , the last version 1.99 released in 2009 gives very interesting results in terms of mass composition  @xcite .",
    "due to the constraints of particle physics , air shower simulations using  present a larger number of muons at ground  @xcite .",
    "it allows for the first time to reproduce both the muon number and the elongation rate using a reasonable average mass for all energies between the knee and the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cut - off .    on the other hand , the new measurements at lhc",
    "give us the opportunity to test the model more deeply .",
    "after a general introduction of the  model , we will explain in this paper the new developments done in  2 .",
    "one may consider the simple parton model to be the basis of high energy hadron - hadron interaction models , which can be seen as an exchange of a `` parton ladder '' between the two hadrons .",
    ", scaledwidth=24.0% ]    in , the term `` parton ladder '' is actually meant to contain two parts @xcite : the hard one , as discussed above , and a soft one , which is a purely phenomenological object , parameterized in regge pole fashion .    in additions to the parton ladder",
    ", there is another source of particle production : the two off - shell remnants , see fig .",
    "[ ladder ] .",
    "we showed in ref .",
    "@xcite that this `` three object picture '' can solve the `` multi - strange baryon problem '' of conventional high energy models , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    hence  is a consistent quantum mechanical multiple scattering approach based on partons and strings  @xcite , where cross sections and the particle production are calculated consistently , taking into account energy conservation in both cases ( unlike other models where energy conservation is not considered for cross section calculations  @xcite ) .",
    "nuclear effects related to cronin transverse momentum broadening , parton saturation , and screening have been introduced into  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , high density effects leading to collective behavior in heavy ion collisions are also taken into account  @xcite .",
    "thanks to a monte carlo , first the collision configuration is determined : i.e. the number of each type of pomerons exchanged between the projectile and target is fixed and the initial energy is shared between the pomerons and the two remnants . then particle production is accounted from two kinds of sources , remnant decay and cut pomeron . a pomeron may be regarded as a two - layer ( soft ) parton ladder attached to projectile and target remnants through its two legs .",
    "each leg is a color singlet , of type q@xmath0 , qqq or @xmath0@xmath0@xmath0 from the sea , and then each cut pomeron is regarded as two strings , cf .",
    "[ nexus1 ]  a ) and b ) .",
    "it is a natural idea to take quarks and anti - quarks from the sea as string ends for soft pomeron in , because an arbitrary number of pomerons may be involved .",
    "thus , besides the three valence quarks , each remnant has additionally quarks and anti - quarks to compensate the flavors of the string ends , as shown in fig .",
    "[ nexus1 ]  c ) . according to its number of quarks and anti - quarks , to the phase space , and to an excitation probability",
    ", a remnant decays into mesons and/or ( anti)baryons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this process leads to a baryon stopping phenomenon in which the baryon number can be transfered from the remnant to the string ends ( for instance in  [ nexus1 ]  d ) , depending on the process , the @xmath1 can be seen as 3 mesons or a baryon - antibaryon pair ) .    in case of meson projectile",
    ", this kind of diquark pair production at the string ends leads to an increase of the ( anti)baryon production in the forward production in agreement with low energy pion - nucleus data  @xcite as shown fig .",
    "[ fig - se ] . comparing to qgsjetii model  @xcite which do not have diquark",
    "as string ends or using only q@xmath0 as string end in , we can clearly see that this process is needed to reproduce experimental data . as a consequence it is part of the larger number of muons in air shower simulations with .",
    "energy momentum sharing and remnant treatment are the key points of the model concerning air shower simulations because they directly influence the multiplicity and the inelasticity of the model .",
    "with the start of the lhc era , it is now possible to develop some particular physics point of the  model , which will be possible to test with newly available data .      in  2 ,",
    "a new tool has been developed for treating the hydrodynamical evolution ( see @xcite for details and tests with auau data ) .",
    "as we saw , in case of elementary reactions like proton proton scattering ( at moderately relativistic energies ) , hadron production is realized via string breaking , such that string fragments are identified with hadrons .",
    "when it comes to heavy ion collisions or very high energy proton - proton scattering , the procedure has to be modified , since the density of strings will be so high that they can not possibly decay independently . for technical reasons",
    ", we split each string into a sequence of string segments , at a given proper - time @xmath2 , corresponding to widths @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the string parameter space .",
    "one distinguishes between string segments in dense areas ( more than some critical density @xmath5 of segments per unit volume ) , from those in low density areas .",
    "the high density areas are referred to as core , the low density areas as corona @xcite .",
    "string segments with large transverse momentum ( close to a kink ) are excluded from the core . based on the four - momenta of infinitesimal string segments ,",
    "@xmath6 one computes the energy - momentum tensor and conserved currents .",
    "the corresponding energy density @xmath7 and the flow velocity @xmath8 serve as initial conditions for the subsequent hydrodynamic evolutions , which is characterized by :    * consideration of the possibility to have a ( moderate ) initial collective transverse flow ; * event - by - event procedure , taking into the account the highly irregular space structure of single events , being experimentally visible via so - called ridge structures in two - particle correlations ; * use of an efficient code for solving the hydrodynamic equations in 3 + 1 dimensions , including the conservation of baryon number , strangeness , and electric charge ; * employment of a realistic equation - of - state , compatible with lattice gauge results  with a cross - over transition from the hadronic to the plasma phase ; * use of a complete hadron resonance table , making our calculations compatible with the results from statistical models ; * hadronic cascade procedure after hadronization from the thermal system at an early stage .      in order to produce hard diffractive events",
    "as measured at tevatron and most likely at lhc in the near future , it was necessary to improve the way of producing diffractive events in  2 . to get a consistent description of low mass and high mass diffraction ,",
    "an effective diffractive pomeron is used in addition to the soft and semi - hard pomeron .",
    "this effective object represents in reality all type of diagrams ( soft and hard component ) which are not connected to at least one of the remnant , leaving the latter intact .",
    "the triple pomeron would be part of this object , but all higher orders too .",
    "since this object is very difficult to calculate explicitly at all orders including proper energy conservation , we use a simple parameterization having the same form as the usual pomeron ( see @xcite ) and fixing the parameters using the proton - proton single diffractive cross section and the energy spectrum of leading protons .      in order to test hard scattering at lhc ( or tevatron ) using , it is important to be able to reproduce the structure function @xmath9 as measured thanks to the hera electron - proton collider .",

    "[ f2-diag ] .",
    "the cross section of a quark with a given @xmath10 as a function of the momentum fraction @xmath11 can be calculated using the convolution of a soft pre - evolution with the dglap equations for the perturbative development of the parton ladder  @xcite .",
    "taking into account the effective corrections due to higher order diagrams in the connection between the pomeron and the nucleon ( and fixed with proton - proton cross section ) , we obtain the structure function as shown in fig .",
    "[ f2-data ] .     for different values of @xmath10",
    "together with experimental data from h1  @xcite , zeus  @xcite and nmc  @xcite .",
    "[ f2-data ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in  2 , not only the soft pomerons can have a diquark as string - end , but the semi - hard pomerons are now treated the same way .",
    "it will increase the production of ( anti-)baryons in the forward region compared to the previous version of .",
    "this may be seen in the number of muons produced in air shower simulations .    furthermore , to take into account the property of different jet types , the string tension used for the string fragmentation now depends on the initial partons .",
    "jets coming from quarks or from gluons will not produce the same ratio of ( anti-)baryons or strange particles over pions , and it will change the energy evolution of such ratios .",
    "the new treatment of the diffraction together with the better calculation of the structure function and the more accurate treatment of the hydrodynamical phase , provide much better results in comparison with lhc data than with  1.99 .",
    "we show the pseudorapidity distribution at 7 tev in fig .",
