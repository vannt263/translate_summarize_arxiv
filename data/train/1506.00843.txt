    "it is quite apparent that the macroscopic world largely operates in an irreversible fashion , to the extent that the underlying time reversal symmetry of the laws of physics is often obscured .",
    "processes at the macroscale typically evolve spontaneously in a specific direction and not in reverse , unless driven to do so by external control .",
    "it is very straightforward to list examples of irreversibility : heat flow , chemical reaction , particle diffusion , decay of coherent motion , inelastic collisions , brittle fracture and a host of other phenomena of a dissipative character .",
    "the triumph of thermodynamics , from its emergence in the 19th century up to the present day , is to interpret all these phenomena as aspects of the second law .",
    "recent studies of irreversible processes at the microscopic level have revealed a richer meaning of the traditional second law and of the associated entropy production that quantifies the irreversibility of a given process @xcite . at microscopic scales , it is clear that a process can evolve both forwards and backwards as a result of spontaneous fluctuations in the system or its environment .",
    "a sequence of improbable but not impossible collisions between molecules can drive a reaction from products back into reactants for a short time , or a particle up instead of down a concentration gradient .",
    "developments in the thermodynamics of small systems in recent years have made it possible to incorporate this transitory behaviour into the same framework that accounts for the much more clearly irreversible processes operating at the macroscale .",
    "this broader viewpoint can be expressed through a framework of deterministic dynamics @xcite , or alternatively by using the concepts of stochastic thermodynamics @xcite , where phenomenological noise is introduced into the dynamics of a system coupled to an environment in order to account for and to quantify dissipative behaviour .",
    "the _ stochastic _ entropy production that features in this latter approach is defined in terms of the relative likelihood that a system should evolve along a particular path or along its reverse .",
    "this quantity has received considerable attention , particularly studies of the way its statistics are governed by identities known as fluctuation relations @xcite .",
    "for example , while the stochastic entropy production can be both positive and negative as a system evolves , it satisfies an integral fluctuation relation which implies that its expected rate of change is non - negative when averaged over many repeated trials of the stochastic dynamics , real or imagined .",
    "when fluctuations are small , departures from the second law are rare , but excursions away from mean behaviour can be substantial for small systems or for short processes , and the rules that govern this behaviour extend the meaning of the second law at such scales .    traditionally there has been just one measure of irreversibility : thermodynamic entropy production , and many studies have investigated its evolution in systems subject to dissipation , e.g. @xcite . in stochastic thermodynamics ,",
    "however , it has been possible to define components of entropy production associated with different aspects of irreversibility , each possessing specific properties @xcite .",
    "for example , the irreversibility of the cooling of a saucepan of hot soup differs somewhat from the irreversibility of the steady transport of heat from a hot plate through the saucepan and into the surrounding air that can maintain the soup at a desired temperature .",
    "both are associated with the production of thermodynamic entropy : in the first case it may be described as relaxational , while in the second it has been referred to as housekeeping production required to maintain a steady state @xcite . in stochastic thermodynamics",
    "each of these modes of entropy production has been quantified in terms of the underlying dynamics of a system coupled to an environment .",
    "analysis has shown , however , that two components are not always sufficient , and the housekeeping element can separate into two parts , one of which has a transient nature @xcite .",
    "systems driven by a time dependent environment under constraints that break the principle of detailed balance in the underlying dynamics will evolve irreversibly in a fashion characterised by three components of stochastic entropy production .",
    "a similar conclusion was later reached by @xcite but with an alternative choice of representation . in this study",
    "we investigate the statistics of the three contributions for a simple case of thermal transport .    in section [ sec : stochastic - thermodynamics - in ]",
    "we introduce the system of interest , a single particle performing underdamped brownian motion in a confining potential while coupled to a nonisothermal environment characterised by a time and space dependent temperature . after defining the components of stochastic entropy production , further details of which",
    "are given in appendix [ sec : components - of - stochastic-1 ] , we employ in section [ sec : mean - stochastic - entropy ] an approximate solution to the kramers equation describing the evolution of an ensemble of such systems , derived in appendix [ sec : variational - solution - to ] , to quantify the mean behaviour of each contribution .",
    "we note in appendix [ sec : entropy - production ] that the solution method resembles the constrained extremisation of the spatial density of the mean rate of production of stochastic entropy @xcite , analogous to onsager s",
    "principle @xcite , although the interpretation is not unproblematic . in section [ sec : distributions - of - stochastic ] we generate individual realisations of the motion using a langevin equation in order to obtain the distribution of fluctuations of stochastic entropy production about the mean .",
    "our particular aim is to demonstrate the importance of the transient component of housekeeping entropy production .",
    "we also demonstrate that as long as the friction coefficient is not too small , the total entropy production as well as its relaxational component satisfy detailed fluctuation relations for certain time intervals and driving protocols , and in appendix [ sec : detailed - fluctuation ] we perform an analysis to provide an understanding of this behaviour .",
    "this is a demonstration that an underlying exponential asymmetry in the production and consumption of entropy can be made apparent as long as the conditions are chosen carefully . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "a key aspect of stochastic thermodynamics is that it provides a link between thermodynamic concepts , such as entropy production , and a description of the mechanical evolution of a system .",
    "the stochastic nature of the dynamics is important in that it ties in with an interpretation of entropy production as the progressive loss of certainty in the microscopic state of a system as time progresses .",
    "such loss is perhaps more fundamentally a consequence of a sensitivity to initial conditions within a setting of deterministic dynamics , together with the difficulty in preparing a system in a precise initial state , but introducing phenomenological noise into a streamlined version of the dynamics has a similar effect .",
    "thermodynamics is the study of the behaviour of a system in an environment where some of the features are specified only approximately ( this is particularly the case for the environment ) .",
    "we therefore expect any modelling approach to have limited predictive power . in stochastic thermodynamics",
    "it turns out that stochastic entropy production , operationally defined in terms of certain energy exchanges , embodies this predictive failure .",
    "it is striking to conclude that microscopic uncertainty may essentially be measured using a thermometer , and that an apparent determinism in the form of the second law for large systems can emerge from a fundamentally underspecified dynamics .",
    "it seems that one of the few matters about which we can be certain , in such a situation , is that microscopic uncertainty should increase .",
    "we focus our discussion on the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) motion of a particle coupled to a nonisothermal environment , described by the following stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the particle position and velocity , respectively , @xmath3 is time , @xmath4 is the friction coefficient , @xmath5 is a spatially dependent force field acting on the particle , assumed to be related to a potential @xmath6 ; @xmath7 is the particle mass , @xmath8 is a space and time dependent environmental temperature and @xmath9 is an increment in a wiener process .",
    "( [ eq:1a ] ) is to be interpreted using it@xmath10 rules of stochastic calculus @xcite .",
    "we should note that heat baths are normally regarded as having static thermal properties , so the time dependence of @xmath11 is to be interpreted as the sequential decoupling and recoupling of the system to reservoirs at slightly different temperatures .",
    "the effect of an evolving thermal environment on a system can then be taken into account , retaining the essential requirement that heat exchanges with the system should not affect the properties of the environment .",
    "it should be noted that a similar framework for discussing an evolving environmental temperature in stochastic thermodynamics has recently been presented @xcite . indeed",
    "the above sdes , often with a constant @xmath11 and in the overdamped limit , have been used a starting point for discussing a great number of characteristics of irreversible behaviour .    following seifert @xcite ,",
    "stochastic entropy production is defined as a measure of the probabilistic mechanical irreversibility of the motion .",
