    "the most likely cause of this turbulence is that disks are unstable to linear perturbations if they are weakly magnetized @xcite .",
    "although this magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) is the most promising mechanism to drive turbulence in protoplanetary disks , the numerical convergence of simulations with increasing resolution continues to be an open issue .",
    "it has been shown that mri - driven turbulence in ideal , magnetized , unstratified disks without mean magnetic fields decreases with increasing resolution and might be negligible when resolution is high and numerical dissipation is small @xcite . to maintain a nonzero , convergent level of turbulent accretion , it has been argued that simulated disks might require stratification @xcite , explicit dissipation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this probably occurs because of the inclusion of larger - scale instability modes in the larger boxes ; it is not a particularly dramatic effect , though , because the smallest box size that we study already captures the fastest growing modes .",

    "[ ss : rd ] , our measured spread of eccentricity in our fiducial model is in approximate agreement with oim07 . on the other hand , n05 reported a typical eccentricity growth of @xmath152 for @xmath153 . with @xmath154 at radius @xmath155 in the model studied by n05 ( richard  p. nelson 2009 , private communication ) and @xmath150 , the eccentricity deviation given by equation  ( [ e : de ] ) is about one order of magnitude less than what was reported by n05 .    one possible explanation for this inconsistency could be the presence of large - scale structures , particularly @xmath156 modes , in global , but not in local models .",
    "oim07 reported that the inclusion of an @xmath133 mode in their torque formula induces a ten times greater impact of hydromagnetic turbulence on particle orbits , using the calibration with global mhd simulations provided by lsa04 .",
    "inspection of lsa04 , as well as n05 , shows that the density structures in their global models often extend more than @xmath157 in azimuthal angle , leading to the @xmath133 mode having the largest amplitude .",
    "such large - scale modes indeed can be excited in self - gravitating disks , and they could also be excited by local turbulence .",
    "this idea is offered some support by the modest growth in density perturbations in larger boxes that we find ( fig .",
    "[ fi : mrit_box ] ) , and the growth in @xmath105 reported in larger boxes by @xcite .    in figure  [ fi : det_box ]",
    "we examine the growth in eccentricity deviation as a function of box size in our local models . increasing",
    "the horizontal box size by a factor of four indeed increases the eccentricity deviation by a factor of four , though this still does not account for the order of magnitude higher value found by n05 in his global model .",
    "if @xmath133 modes indeed can be similarly excited by well resolved turbulence , though , this could offer an explanation for the discrepancy .",
    "however , using local models with mean azimuthal fields , @xcite reported that the coherent structures induced by the mri are localized , with correlation lengths of about @xmath158 , @xmath159 , and @xmath158 in radial , azimuthal , and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is possible that current global models might not have enough resolution to model such fine structures , which were then spuriously connected into extended structures resembling @xmath133 modes . to determine the physical reality of large - scale structure in turbulent disks , global models capable of resolving localized structures will be needed .",
    "another important quantity in the study of planetesimal dynamics is the velocity dispersion of the particles .",
    "we calculate the radial and the azimuthal components of velocity dispersion by taking the standard deviations of radial and azimuthal velocities for all particles , i.e. , @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "since all the dynamical equations are linearized in terms of @xmath162 in the local shearing box approximation , the background shear flow is uniform irrespective of position , so the velocity dispersion for all particles in the computational domain is a well - defined local quantity .",
    "figure  [ fi : uil0 ] plots @xmath160 and @xmath161 measured for particles with zero initial eccentricity in the low - mass disk version of our fiducial model as a function of time @xmath106 .",
    "the velocity dispersion monotonically increases with time , and thus hydromagnetic turbulence tends to steadily heat up a planetesimal disk . note that @xmath163 , a sanity check that our results are consistent with a swarm of non - interacting particles moving epicyclically in a keplerian disk .",
    "figure  [ fi : ux ] compiles the radial velocity dispersions @xmath160 as a function of elapsed time @xmath146 measured in our fiducial model for particles with different initial eccentricity @xmath101 moving in disks of different disk gravity . as is the case with the radial drift and eccentricity deviation discussed in  [ ss : rd ] and  [ ss : ecc ] , the results depend linearly on @xmath123 , the strength of disk gravity , though there seems to be a slightly enhanced effect for particles with @xmath164 .",
    "given the uncertainty involved in the numerical simulations , we assume it is a secondary effect as a first approximation .",
    "the best fit to all six models is then given by @xmath165 the corresponding timescale @xmath166 for turbulent excitation of velocity dispersion can be estimated by @xmath167 , and we find from equation  ( [ e : rvd ] ) @xmath168 ^ 2.\\ ] ] increasing the box size increases the magnitude of this effect , as shown in figure  [ fi : ux_box ] , possibly even non - linearly .    as noted in  [ ss : ecc ] , hydromagnetic turbulence can act either to excite the eccentricities of planetesimals or to circularize their eccentric orbits .",
    "however , a perfectly cold disk of planetesimals with nonzero initial eccentricity but vanishing velocity dispersion will be monotonically heated by the turbulence , as shown above .",
    "the velocity dispersion increases with time while the mean eccentricity may remain unchanged unless a significant fraction of particles are circularized .",
    "therefore , the eccentricity may not necessarily be proportional to the velocity dispersion for a swarm of planetesimals moving through hydromagnetic turbulence .",
    "the velocity dispersion of a planetesimal disk also grows with time due to mutual gravitational scattering .",

    "therefore , hydromagnetic turbulence probably dominates the heating of a disk of kilometer - sized planetesimals , while gravitational scattering may be more important for objects approaching earth size .",

    "in this section , we apply our results on the orbital evolution of zero - mass particles to two specific problems in planet formation .",
    "first , we estimate the strength of diffusive migration of protoplanets due to hydromagnetic turbulence and discuss their survivability under type  i migration following the analytical framework established by jgm06 .",
    "secondly , we revisit the proposition of igm08 that planetesimals may suffer from collisional destruction as a result of hydromagnetic turbulence excitation of velocity dispersion among them .      using a fokker - planck formalism , jgm06 derived an advection - diffusion equation to describe the evolution of the distribution of protoplanets under the influence of both type  i migration and hydromagnetic turbulence .",
    "@xcite further consolidated the analysis by studying more realistic disk density structure with both spatial and time dependence .",
    "these authors found that turbulence tends to reduce the lifetimes of most protoplanets while allowing some of them to linger long enough to survive rapid inward type  i migration .",
    "the likelihood of producing a planetary system with a specific configuration sensitively depends on the strength of the diffusive migration induced by the turbulence , however .",
    "jgm06 and @xcite calibrated the turbulence strength with the global disk models computed by lsa04 , @xcite , and n05 .",

    "the value of @xmath213 estimated in equation  ( [ e : eps ] ) is about an order of magnitude smaller than what was reported by omm07 for a stratified disk model with zero net flux on a @xmath216 grid at the same resolution as our fiducial model with 64 points per scale height . to identify the reason for this discrepancy",
    ", we further evaluate the magnitude and the correlation time of the torques exerted by the turbulent gas on the particles in our model .",
    "firstly , the root - mean - square of the @xmath8-component of the gravitational force per unit mass exerted by the gas over all time and particles is @xmath217 .",
    "we find negligible difference between torques calculated following the particles along their orbits and those calculated at the fixed center of the box .",
    "the magnitude we obtained is reasonably consistent with the value of @xmath218 reported by omm07 at the same numerical resolution .",
    "secondly , we plot in figure  [ fi : acf ] the autocorrelation functions ( acf ) of @xmath219 for several randomly selected particles as well as at the center of the box .",
    "the results are again similar to what was reported by omm07 , indicating a similar estimate for the correlation time , @xmath220 .",
    "the source of the discrepancy appears to be neither of these factors .",
    "we notice , though , that omm07 could have overestimated the correlation time by equating it to the value of the second zero - crossing of the acf . strictly speaking , the correlation time",
    "should instead be computed by integrating an ensemble average of the acf over all possible realizations , as motivated by the definitions of the diffusion coefficient and the correlation time in jgm06 : @xmath221 and @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the fluctuating part of the torque and the overline denotes ensemble average .",
    "since we distribute numerous particles uniformly over the entire computational domain , the acf obtained for each particle can be considered as one realization , and the average of the acfs over all particles may resemble the true ensemble average .",
    "this averaged acf is shown by the solid black curve in figure  [ fi : acf ] .",
    "note that the oscillation occurring at time lag longer than the second crossing for each particle is much reduced , indicating the noise nature of the autocorrelation at long time lag .",
    "however , the negative value of the acf between the first two zero - crossings remains significant .",
    "this interval represents the anti - diffusion nature of the stochastic torques that we believe could be responsible for reducing the diffusion coefficient .",
    "therefore , we suggest that a better approximation for the correlation time in accordance with equations  ( [ e : jgmd ] ) and  ( [ e : jgmt ] ) be @xmath224 where @xmath225 is the ensemble - averaged acf of the torque per unit mass @xmath219 as a function of time lag @xmath226 . using equation  ( [ e : ct ] )",
    ", we find that in our fiducial model @xmath227 , about one order of magnitude less than the value of @xmath228 reported by omm07 . with the same approximation @xmath229 used by omm07 , we find that @xmath230 , in good agreement with the estimate of @xmath231 we derived from our direct measurement of particle radial drifts",

    ", one should refer to equation  ( [ e : ct ] ) to measure the correlation time of the stochastic torques , instead of conventional methods like using the zero - crossing of the acf or the timescale of the peak of the temporal power spectrum , which probably give about one order of magnitude larger values",
    ". it will be enlightening for studies based on global models to conduct the same exercise described in this section , since this will likely explain part of the orders of magnitude discrepancy in diffusion coefficients derived from local versus global models .",
    "( although the box size effects we have identified must also contribute to this discrepancy , they appear unable to increase the derived value of @xmath213 by more than one order of magnitude . )    according to figures  6 and  7 of jgm06 , the value of @xmath213 we inferred from our simulations indicates that advective ( type  i ) migration dominates over diffusive ( stochastic ) migration for the parameter space jgm06 have investigated . for an earth - mass protoplanet at a radial distance up to 100  au in the mmsn disk and in a viscous disk with @xmath233 , advection dominates when @xmath234 and @xmath235 , respectively . for a protoplanet of mass as low as 0.01  @xmath236 at @xmath237  au in the same disk models , advection dominates when @xmath238 and @xmath239 , respectively .",
    "the critical distance and mass for the transition between dominance of advection and diffusion given our small estimate of @xmath213 for our fiducial model is outside of the parameter space explored by jgm06 , and even our largest box has a value of @xmath213 less than an order of magnitude larger . by inspection of figure  7 in jgm06 ,",
    "though , the transition masses for an object at 10  au in the mmsn disk and in the viscous disk probably lies at about @xmath88 and @xmath240 , respectively .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that hydromagnetic turbulence does not significantly affect the secular migration of earth - sized protoplanets in regimes of current astrophysical interest .",
    "nevertheless , torques exerted by turbulent density perturbations seem to be a dominant agent determining the orbital dynamics of kilometer - sized planetesimals .",
    "igm08 suggested that hydromagnetic turbulence may inhibit the growth of kilometer - sized planetesimals .",
    "they argued that the velocity dispersion excited by the turbulence could be so large that collisions between planetesimals exceed their material strength or self - gravity , leading to destruction .",
    "their conclusion , however , relies on orbital integrations incorporating the heuristic , stochastic formulas for the time history of gravitational torques provided by lsa04 , which in turn were calibrated using mhd simulations of a global disk model . as pointed out in  [ ss : ecc ] , a possible inconsistency exists between global and local models . since the latter shows a significantly lower effect on orbital dynamics of planetesimals , it is worthwhile revisiting the planetesimal growth problem in light of the results highlighted in this work .    for comparison purposes ,",
    "we adopt the same scalable mmsn disk model as used by igm08 . the gas density and the speed of sound in the mid - plane",
    "are given by @xmath241 and @xmath242 respectively , where a solar - type host star ( @xmath243 ) is assumed and @xmath244 is a scale factor . when @xmath245 , the disk mass is about 1.4 times that of an mmsn disk .",
    "the corresponding @xmath123-parameter and ratio of disk scale height to radial distance then become @xmath246 and @xmath247 respectively .",
    "substituting equations  ( [ e : xi_mmsn ] ) and ( [ e : hor_mmsn ] ) into equation  ( [ e : de ] ) , which is derived from our fiducial high - resolution model , we arrive at @xmath248 comparing equation  ( [ e : de_mmsn ] ) with equation  ( 13 ) of igm08 with the understanding that @xmath249 for particles with zero initial eccentricity ( see  [ ss : ecc ] ) , we find the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath250  a measure of the strength of hydromagnetic turbulence used by igm08  in our orbital integrations to be @xmath251 .",
    "the rest of the analysis performed by igm08 remains unchanged since the effects induced by hydromagnetic turbulence are all incorporated in the parameter @xmath250 .    as noted in ",
    "[ ss : ecc ] , enlarging the horizontal size of our shearing box by a factor of four at our medium resolution increases the amplitude of the eccentricity deviation by about a factor of four .",
    "nevertheless , the largest box we have studied gives @xmath252 , which remains somewhat smaller than the @xmath253@xmath239 estimated by igm08 .",
    "the rather small values of @xmath250 we obtained indicate that hydromagnetic turbulence might not pose as serious a threat to the growth of kilometer - sized planetesimals as suggested by igm08 .",
    "these authors compared the critical radii of planetesimals for accretive and erosive regimes due to different turbulence strengths @xmath254 , and @xmath255 in their figures  3 , 4 , and  5 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath250 we measured point to a scenario in between what is predicted by figures  4 and  5 of igm08 . in this scenario , the erosive regime only appears in the outer regions of a young protoplanetary disk and it disappears rapidly with decreasing disk mass .",
    "kilometer - sized planetesimals may be able to evade collisional destruction in the inner regions of the disk .",
    "we reiterate that the value of @xmath250 measured here pertains to a local region with turbulent stresses such that @xmath113 and @xmath256 . as discussed in ",
    "[ ss : ecc ] , the validity of our results in a global context remains to be demonstrated by numerical experiments on a global disk model with a resolution capable of resolving the characteristic scales of coherent turbulence structures .",
    "in this work , we have used local , shearing - box simulations to study the dynamics of massless planetesimals in a turbulent , isothermal , unstratified , gas disk driven by the mri . with a uniform , vertical magnetic field but without explicit physical dissipation , the saturated turbulence is maintained at a roughly constant level , showing convergence with increasing resolution . by adopting a suitable magnitude for the net magnetic flux , we produce a fiducial disk model with turbulent accretion at the level of @xmath0 and with root - mean - square density perturbations @xmath257% . as discussed in  [ ss : cusr ] , this model can be scaled to other physical systems of interest , as long as the assumption of negligible self - gravity of the gas remains valid . after the hydromagnetic turbulence in our fiducial model reaches saturation ,",
    "we distribute numerous particles of zero mass and integrate their orbital motion under the gravitational influence of the turbulent gas .",
    "the stochastic nature of the orbital evolution of these particles is evident , so we characterize their orbital dynamics with statistical distributions , finding three major results . first ,",
    "although the mean orbital radius does not change , particles slowly drift away from their original radii , so that the distribution of radii grows with time .",
    "second , gravitational force from density perturbations produced in hydromagnetic turbulence can both excite and damp the eccentricities of particle orbits , with again no change in the mean value , but a growing width of distribution if the particles possess non - negligible initial eccentricities . finally , the planetesimal disk is heated up by the turbulence , a process dominating over gravitational scattering between particles in most physical conditions relevant to protoplanetary gas disks and planetesimal sizes .",
    "a corollary of these results is that eccentricity does not serve as a good indicator of the velocity dispersion of the particles .",
    "the amplitude of orbital changes driven by the turbulence in our local models is significantly smaller than what was reported in recent global models ( lsa04 ; n05 ; igm08 ) .",
    "two possible explanations for this discrepancy suggest themselves : either insufficient resolution in the global models or the lack of convergence with box size in our local shearing box model , as discussed in  [ ss : ecc ] .",
    "if our local results are valid , they indicate that although hydromagnetic turbulence can drive radial diffusion , eccentricity variations , and relative velocities of planetesimals and protoplanets , these effects may not be dominant in determining their evolution .",
    "in particular , it appears that type  i migration dominates over turbulent radial drift for objects well above @xmath255  m@xmath258 .",
    "in addition , hydromagnetic turbulence might not be exciting sufficient velocity dispersion to drive planetesimals into an erosive regime that would inhibit their further growth .",
