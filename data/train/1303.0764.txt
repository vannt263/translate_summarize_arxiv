    "<S> we derive a formula for the electric polarization of interacting insulators , expressed in terms of the full green s and vertex functions . </S>",
    "<S> we exemplify this method in the half - filled ionic hubbard model treated within dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electric polarization of a correlated band insulator is determined by the interplay of ionicity and covalency , and both quantities are renormalized by the electron - electron interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce quasiparticle approximation to the exact equation for the polarization , and compare the results of this approximation with those of the exact dmft formulation and of static mean field theories such as the lda+ u. the latter overestimates the electronic contribution to the electric polarization when the quasiparticle weight of the active bands is very small . </S>"
