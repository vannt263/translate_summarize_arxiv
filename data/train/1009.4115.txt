    "the frequency change due to temperature is small compared to the observed backaction ( see main text ) .",
    "the intrinsic quality factor decreases significantly with increasing temperature .",
    "this rules out that the observed frequency shift and q - factor change are caused by heating of the resonator due to joule heating in the junctions : we observe an _ increase _ in quality factor with increasing bias current and voltage setpoint ( i.e. dissipation ) , but a _ decrease _ in quality factor with increasing temperature .",
    "an increased damping at higher temperatures is seen more often in micro- or nanomechanical resonators @xcite .    the observed frequency shift and change in damping",
    "do not depend on the driving power .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : power]c , the measured resonator response stays the same in all panels .",
    "although the driving power is changed by three orders of magnitude , the only effect is that the signal - to - noise ratio becomes better when increasing the power .    for the highest driving power ( @xmath76 ) and highest q - factor ( @xmath77 ) the amplitude of the resonator motion is @xmath78 , as determined using the calibrated displacement responsivity @xcite . the flux through the dc squid is then modulated with an amplitude @xmath79 .",

    "to calculate the backaction , the dc squid is modelled using the resistively- and capacitively - shunted junction ( rcsj ) model .",
    "this widely - used model is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the introduction to this model presented here is largely based on this review .",
    "a current @xmath1 is sent through the squid and the circulating current @xmath25 redistributes the current over the two junctions , which we assume to be identical . in the rcsj model , the two junctions ( labelled with @xmath93 ) are modelled as a resistor ( @xmath46 ) , capacitor ( @xmath94 ) and an `` ideal '' josephson junction with critical current @xmath95 in parallel .",
    "the voltage over each junction is related to the time derivative of the phase difference @xmath96 of the superconducting wave function : @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the flux quantum .",
    "current conservation yields two second - order differential equations , governing the time - dependence of the phase differences @xmath99 of the junctions : @xmath100 these equations are coupled to each other by the amount of flux piercing the loop : @xmath101 the total flux @xmath102 has two contributions : the externally applied flux @xmath2 ( which also includes the flux due to the resonator displacement ) and the flux due to the circulating current flowing through the inductance of the loop @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 .",
    "the equations are scaled to simplify their numerical integration .",
    "this yields : @xmath105 the bias current and circulating current are normalized using the critical current : @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the inductive screening parameter indicates how much a change in flux is screened by the circulating current @xmath25 flowing through the self - inductance of the loop @xmath103 , whereas @xmath114 indicates the importance of inertial terms due to the junction capacitance @xmath94 .",
    "the three equations are integrated numerically for different bias conditions , i.e. , different values for the bias current @xmath1 and for the flux @xmath2 through the squid .",
    "figure [ fig : simulation]a shows typical examples of calculated time - traces of the circulating current @xmath115 and voltage @xmath116 .",
    "both are rapidly oscillating at a frequency of @xmath117 , which is the josephson frequency that equals the average value of the voltage @xmath118 @xcite .",

    "finally , the capacitance @xmath130 is obtained from the position of the lc resonance in the dc squid @xcite .",
    "when the resonator moves , the flux through the dc squid loop is altered , which in turn changes the average circulating current @xmath25 . in principle , @xmath131 could depend on the all the past displacements , @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "however , the dc squid reacts at a frequency ( @xmath134 ) that is much faster than that of the resonator ( @xmath135 ) , so the circulating current @xmath131 is expected to depends on the _ instantaneous _ displacement @xmath136 . for small amplitudes ( @xmath137 ) the response is linear and gives a contribution @xmath138 .",
    "another contribution comes from the velocity of the resonator , @xmath139 , which causes a time - varying flux .",
    "this generates an electromotive force in the squid loop ( faraday s induction law ) , which also changes the circulating current by @xmath140 .",
    "combining these two effects gives @xmath141 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath142 and @xmath143 depend on the dynamics of the dc squid and are @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "as discussed in the main text , these quantities are related to the intrinsic flux - to - current transfer functions , @xmath146 and @xmath147 .    in principle @xmath148",
    "can be obtained by calculating the average circulating current at different fluxes and then numerically differentiating this to obtain @xmath149 . however , for the velocity - dependent transfer function this is not possible .",
    "our method for calculating these transfer functions @xmath52 and @xmath53 works as follows : we calculate the steady - state response of the circulating current with a small modulation added to the applied flux , @xmath150 . figure [ fig : simulation]b shows that this modulates the circulating current @xmath151 .",

    "the transfer functions do not depend on the modulation frequency , provided that it is sufficiently low .",
    "this confirms that the circulating current only depends on the instantaneous displacement and velocity as was postulated at the beginning of this section ."
