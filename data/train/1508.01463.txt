    "the hamiltonian for the interaction between the rydberg spinwave fields takes the form @xmath69 meanwhile , as the result of the interaction , the population of the intermediate levels spontaneously decaying at the rate @xmath18 gives rise to the photon dissipation , and we describe it by the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath70 in terms of the coupling between the polarization fields and quantum noise fields , where the random - variable noise operators satisfy @xmath71=\\delta_{lm}\\delta({\\bf x}-{\\bf x}^{\\prime})\\delta(t - t^{\\prime})$ ] .",
    "an advantage of this stochastic hamiltonian approach is that the physical process can be modeled by the formal unitary evolution operator @xmath72 with @xmath73 , which naturally leads to the heisenberg - langevin equations of the relevant quantum fields as shown below .    in deriving the dynamical equations ,",

    "the finally obtained realistic potential profiles in the illustrated situations correspond to those of the standstill rydberg spinwaves . though the extending spinwave packets lower the potential magnitudes , the potential values distribute less abruptly over the ensembles .",
    "such potentials due to wave packets instead of point particles exist for any type of interaction .",
    "for instance , the dipole - dipole interaction potentials between the stored wave packets should also be evaluated in this way , and are found to be more inhomogeneous than those of vdw interaction ; see fig .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction is applied in another photonic gate proposal based on stored photon pulses @xcite .",
    "more realistic considerations should be therefore included in quantum information processing by the similar methods .",
    "one of the meaningful consequences of such realistic interaction potentials is that they lead to different dissipation rates over the pulses . in ref .",
    "@xcite about another topic related to rydberg eit , the interaction between pulses is also modeled as the one between extending wave packets , but their dissipation is assumed to be with a global rate independent of the pulse distributions .",

    "an extreme result is that half of a pulse will be absorbed .",
    "negligible decay of the rydberg levels after the control field is turned off maintains stable asymmetric spinwave profiles during the storage period .",

    "<S> different from the ordinary eit @xcite , there exists van der waals ( vdw ) or dipole - dipole interaction between atoms , which modifies the dispersive and dissipative properties of light , as well as the photon correlations , in rydberg medium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions also indicate the possible formation of bound states @xcite and lattice structures @xcite of photons . </S>",
    "<S> more recent experiments @xcite have demonstrated numerous interesting features related to rydberg - atom - mediated interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the above mentioned long - range interactions make rydberg eit medium a promising candidate for quantum information processing with photons . </S>",
    "<S> a fascinating application of this kind is implementing a deterministic two - qubit gate , the building block of photonic quantum computing . </S>",
    "<S> apart from the scenarios working with slowly traveling photons @xcite , a gate operation could be performed with stopped photons that are converted to rydberg atomic excitations , so that the nonlocal interaction between the long - living rydberg spinwaves achieves much more significant nonlinear phases than those generated by the collisional interaction between atoms @xcite . however , because the vdw interaction also brings about unwanted effects , the previous schemes @xcite in this category require more sophisticated technical steps , while it was not clear whether the simplest way to store and regenerate two photons ( without extra procedures ) properly under vdw potential could realize a good gate operation . </S>",

    "<S> the attractive potential @xmath15  pulls \" the central frequency component initially under the eit condition away from the absorption peak , but it  pushes \" the corresponding component in the latter toward the peak . then the positively detuned photons will virtually see two - level systems when they get closer , but the same medium becomes opaque to the negatively detuned ones . </S>",

    "<S> a fast switching with small @xmath53 can immediately stop the pulses at any moment . </S>",
    "<S> one question is whether the non - adiabatic corrections @xcite , connected with terms containing the time derivatives of @xmath0 on the right - hand side of eq . </S>",
