    "it is important to note that all idler - field photons have nearly the same wavelengths which means that signal - field photons emitted into different radial emission angles @xmath51 use different wavelengths of the pulsed - pump spectrum .",
    "the transverse pump - beam profile affects the radial width through the phase - matching condition in the radial plane .",
    "this radial phase matching condition is an additional requirement that must be fulfilled by a generated photon pair .",

    "this behavior is related to the fact that indexes of refraction of the interacting fields are nearly constant inside the correlation area .",

    "the azimuthal width of correlation area is determined predominantly by a pump - beam transverse profile for geometric reasons . to be more specific , it is the pump - beam spatial spectrum in azimuthal direction that affects the azimuthal extension of the correlation area through the phase - matching conditions in the azimuthal direction . as material dispersion characteristics of the crystal",

[ fig10 ] has been experimentally confirmed for several values of the width @xmath204 of pump - beam waist both for cw and pulsed pumping .    on the other hand and in our geometry , it is the width @xmath205 of the pump - beam waist that determines the angular width @xmath206 of angular cross - section @xmath200 .",
