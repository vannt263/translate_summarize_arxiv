    "the purpose of high energy experiments is to resolve the unanswered questions in the standard model ( sm ) through searches of new physics ( np ) using complimentary approaches .",
    "the first approach is at the energy frontiers where the key representatives are the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the main purpose of these two detectors is to smash the particles at sufficiently large energy and then study the different particles produced after this collision .",
    "the second approach is at the rare / precision frontier where lhcb experiment at the lhc and the belle ii at the super kekb are the names of two important experiments in regard to the flavor physics .    in the precision approach",
    "the observable signature of new particles or processes can be obtained through the measurements of flavor physics reactions at lower energies and collect the evidence of any deviation from these predictions .",
    "a natural place is to investigate the flavor - changing - neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes in @xmath8-meson decays where one of the heavy quark makes them an ideal laboratory to test the non - perturbative aspects of the qcd and also make them a fertile hunting ground for testing the sm and probing the possible np effects .",
    "undoubtedly , the predictions of the sm are in good agreement with the collider data until now , however , still there exists some mysteries that are unanswered in this model . just to name the few",
    ", they include neutrino oscillations , baryon asymmetry , dark matter , unification , the strong @xmath4 violation and the hierarchy problems . to answer these issues there exists a plethora of the np models such as the extra dimension models , various supersymmetric models , etc . in grand unification theories such as @xmath9 or string - inspired @xmath10 models @xcite ,",
    "one of the most pertinent is the @xmath3 scenarios that include the family non - universal @xmath3 @xcite and leptophobic @xmath3 models @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the gauge group @xmath9 can be extended to the next important group @xmath11 which has one extra rank and hence lead to an idea of an extra heavy neutral @xmath12 boson @xcite . even though @xmath3 gauge couplings are family universal @xcite , however , due to different constructions of the different families in string models it is possible to have family non - universal @xmath3 couplings .",
    "for example in some of them , three generation of leptons and also the first and second generation of quarks have different coupling to @xmath3 boson when compared to the third families of quarks @xcite .",
    "the details about this model can be seen for instance in @xcite .",
    "searching of an extra @xmath3 boson is an important mission of the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite experiments .",
    "performing constraints on the new @xmath3 couplings through low - energy precise processes is , on the other hand , very crucial and complementary for these direct searches @xmath13 at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a family non - universal @xmath3 model could bring new @xmath4-violating phases beyond the sm and have a large effect on many fcnc processes @xcite , such as the @xmath14 mixing @xcite , as well as some rare @xcite and hadronic @xmath15meson decays @xcite .    in the present study",
    "we will analyze the @xmath16 decay in the family non - universal @xmath3 scenario .",
    "at quark level this decay is governed by the fcnc transition @xmath17 , which aries at loop level in the sm because of the glashow - ilipoulos - maiani ( gim ) mechanism where the new heavily predicted particles of different models can manifest themselves .",
    "in particular , by analyzing the different physical observables like the decay rate , the forward - backward asymmetry and different lepton polarization asymmetries and comparing them with the sm predictions one can test the sm as well as find the traces of the physics beyond it .",
    "a detailed analysis of the above mentioned physical observables in family non - universal @xmath3 model for @xmath18 is discussed in length in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , the study of the polarized and unpolarized @xmath4 violation asymmetries as well as the polarized branching ratio is still missing in the literature .    with the motivation that the behavior of the other observables in the presence of the @xmath3 boson may play a crucial role in redefining our knowledge about the family nonuniversal @xmath3 model , we have studied both polarized and unpolarized @xmath4 violation asymmetries and the polarized branching ratio for @xmath18 , in the sm and @xmath3 model .",
    "in the context of @xmath4 violation asymmetry , it is important to emphasize that the fcnc transitions are proportional to three ckm matrix elements , namely , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ; however , due to the unitarity condition , and neglecting @xmath21 in comparison of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , the @xmath4 violation asymmetry is highly suppressed in the sm .",
    "therefore , the measurement of @xmath4 violation asymmetries in fcnc decays play a pivotal role to find the signatures of the @xmath3 model .",
    "this paper is schemed as follows : in section ii we briefly describe the theoretical formulation necessary for the transition @xmath22 , including , effective hamiltonian , matrix elements in terms of form factors and then define the amplitude by using these matrix elements . in section iii",
    "we give the explicit expression of polarized branching ratio , polarized and unpolarized @xmath4 violation asymmetries for @xmath18 .",
    "section iv presents the phenomenological analysis and discussion on the numerical results .",
    "the summary of the results and concluding remarks will also be given in the same section .",
    "the effective hamiltonian for the decay channel @xmath23 with @xmath24 , proceed through the quark level transition @xmath25 in the sm , can be written as @xmath26where @xmath27 is a fermi coupling constant and @xmath28 are the matrix elements of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix . in above equation ( [ effective hamiltonian 1 ] )",

    ", we have analyzed the effects of np coming through the neutral @xmath3 boson on the polarized branching ratio , unpolarized and polarized @xmath4 violation asymmetries in @xmath117 decays .",
    "we observed that the polarized branching ratio shows a clear signal of the @xmath0 model especially for the extreme values of the parameters corresponding to this model and the values of @xmath118 and @xmath119 are almost 3 times the sm values both for @xmath120 and @xmath111 as final state leptons .",
    "it is well known that in the sm the @xmath4 violation asymmetry is negligible , where as in the present study we have seen that the unpolarized @xmath4 violation asymmetry is considerable in both @xmath121 and @xmath122 channels and hence it is giving a clear message of np arising from the neutral @xmath3 boson .",
    "in addition , all the polarized @xmath4 violation asymmetries are significantly large in @xmath122 decay and they show strong dependence on the parameters of the @xmath3 model .",
    "keeping in view that detection of leptons polarization effects is really a daunting task at the experiments like the atlas , cms and at lhcb , but if we can just keep this issue aside , these @xmath4 violation asymmetries which suffer less from hadronic uncertainties provide us a useful probe to establish the np coming through @xmath3 model .",
