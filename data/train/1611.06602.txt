    "according to quantum chromodynamics , at sufficiently high energy density which can be achieved in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , a new state of matter , called quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) , is created .",

    "the angle @xmath9 determines the direction of maximum final - state particle density and can be reconstructed from the emitted particles themselves .",
    "the most analyzed anisotropic flow is the second order fourier coefficient , @xmath1 , called elliptic flow. the angle @xmath10 corresponds to the event plane which is correlated with the participant plane spanned over the beam direction and the shorter axis of the approximately elliptical shape of the nucleon overlap region . due to the initial - state fluctuations of the position of nucleons at the moment of impact , higher - order deformations of the initial geometry",

    "they are measured with respect to the corresponding event plane angles , @xmath9  @xcite .    if particles are correlated with the event plane than they are also mutually correlated .",

    "<S> the leading modes of the elliptic and triangular flow reproduce rather well the @xmath1 and @xmath2 coefficients experimentally measured using the two - particle correlations . at high-@xmath0 region , where the effect is greatest , the sub - leading flow mode which corresponds to @xmath3 has a small non - zero value and slowly increases from central to peripheral collisions , while the one which corresponds to @xmath4 is even smaller and does not depend on centrality . for @xmath5  2 </S>",
