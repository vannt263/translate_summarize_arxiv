    "supernovae ( sne ) of types ib , ic , and ii are believed to have massive progenitors , because they have been found frequently in or near spiral arms and regions but not in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "few sne ( e.g. , sn1987a ) have recognized massive progenitors ; consequently , little is known about the stellar evolution immediately before the sn explosion",
    ".    evolved massive stars are known to undergo copious mass loss , forming circumstellar nebulae .",
    "the rings around sn  1987a are an example of such a nebula @xcite .",
    "the chemical composition and kinematics of the rings have provided essential constraints that lead to the hypothesis that the b3i progenitor sk@xmath169@xmath2202 was a binary @xcite .",
    "these circumstellar nebulae can also be detected from the presence of narrow h@xmath3 emission lines ( fwhm @xmath4 200 km s@xmath5 ) in spectra of type iin sne @xcite .",
    "the circumstellar nebulae of distant sne can not be resolved spatially , but their expansion , physical conditions , and chemical enrichment can be investigated by high - dispersion ( r @xmath6  30,000 ) spectra , as recently demonstrated for sn1997ab @xcite and sn1978k @xcite .",
    "most available spectroscopic observations of sne have been made with low or intermediate spectral dispersion to study the broad spectral lines of sn ejecta .",
    "these spectra are useful for revealing the presence of narrow nebular lines , but are not adequate for analysis of nebular kinematics and physical conditions .",
    "therefore , we have undertaken a high - dispersion spectroscopic survey of 16 type ii sne .",
    "the results are reported in this paper .",
    "high - dispersion spectra were acquired with the echelle spectrograph using the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope in march 1999 .",
    "the 79 line mm@xmath5 echelle grating was used in combination with a 226 line mm@xmath5 cross - disperser and the long - focus red camera to achieve a reciprocal dispersion of 3.5   mm@xmath5 at h@xmath3 .",
    "the spectra were imaged with the t2 kb ccd detector , where the pixel size of 24 @xmath7 m corresponds to 024 pixel@xmath5 along the slit and @xmath03.7 km  s@xmath5 pixel@xmath5 at the h@xmath3  line along the dispersion axis .",
    "the spectral coverage was roughly 40007000  .",
    "the instrumental resolution for the 1  wide slit , as measured from the widths of sky lines , was @xmath010 km  s@xmath5(fwhm ) at h@xmath3 .",
    "the sky conditions were moderate to poor due to variable high cirrus and nearly full lunar phase , making the target acquisition difficult at times .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the echelle and longslit packages in iraf with careful attention paid to the orders that contained h@xmath3  emission .",
    "observations of the spectrophotometric standard gd140 were used to correct for the blaze , illumination , and spectral response , but the resulting spectra were not calibrated to an absolute flux scale as the observing conditions were not photometric .",
    "in addition to the objects observed at kpno , we have also observed sn1978k with the echelle spectrograph on the 4 m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in december 2000 . the instrument was configured with similar optical elements as were used for the kpno observations , and the spatial and spectral parameters are therefore similar .",
    "all observations are summarized in table  [ tab_obssum ] .",
    "our high - dispersion echelle observations are useful in distinguishing among three sources of line emission in distant sne :    * sn ejecta , which can be identified by a broad ( width @xmath8 1000 km  s@xmath5 ) , spatially - unresolved h@xmath3 line ; * unshocked circumstellar material ( csm ) ejected by the sn progenitor , which shows narrow ( width @xmath9 200 km  s@xmath5 ) , spatially - unresolved h@xmath3 and [ ] @xmath106548 , 6583 lines ; and * interstellar medium ( ism ) of the host galaxy , which is characterized by narrow , spatially - extended h@xmath3 emission and forbidden lines such as [ ] @xmath115007 and [ ] @xmath106716,6731 .    to search for emission from the sn , csm , and ism in each of our spectra , we used the spatio - kinematic descriptions of line emission given above along with the criterion that the statistical significance of the peak of an emission component be @xmath83@xmath12 per resolution element ( e.g. , @xmath010 km  s@xmath5@xmath13 1  at h@xmath3 ) with respect to the background rms noise .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab_observe ]",
    ".    of the 16 sne observed , we clearly detect broad line emission from the sn ejecta from four sources : sn1978k , sn1995n , sn1997eg , and sn1998s . in two further cases , sn1999e and sn1999z ,",
    "broad h@xmath3  emission line may be detected , but significant portions of the line profiles are lost between echelle orders .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the line and continuum emission components from the sn ejecta of these two latter objects .",
    "our low detection rate of the sne is likely caused by the faintness of the sne and the poor sky condition .",
    "the majority of the sne observed were not visible in the images taken by the acquisition camera .",
    "blind offsets from nearby stars had to be employed for target acquisition .",
    "if the coordinates of a sn from the literature were off by more than 1  perpendicular to the slit , our blind - offset observations would have missed the target entirely .",
    "the h@xmath3 echellograms and line profiles of sn1995n , sn1997eg , sn1998s , sn1999e , and sn1999z are presented in figure  [ fig_sndetecta]&b , along with finding charts .",
    "spectral scales are given in both observed wavelengths and velocities relative to the host galaxy s systemic velocity .",
    "the broad h@xmath3 emission from the sn ejecta , detected over several thousand km  s@xmath5 , is evident in each image .",
    "sn1978k was detected with the highest signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio ; several lines were detected .",
    "its h@xmath3 line image and the profiles of 10 spectral lines are presented in figure  [ fig_sn1978k ] . while h@xmath3 , h@xmath14 , and @xmath115876 lines of the sn ejecta are broad , they are not as broad as the h@xmath3 line of the other three sne we detected . more interestingly",
    ", a narrow nebular component is detected in h@xmath3 , [ ] @xmath106548 , 6583 and [ ] @xmath115007 lines .",
    "the high [ ] /h@xmath3 ratio indicates that this narrow component originates from a circumstellar nebula @xcite .    besides sn1978k",
    ", the only other sn in our sample that shows emission components from a circumstellar nebula is sn1998s . in figure  [ fig_sn1998s ]",
    "we show the narrow h@xmath3 , [ ] , and [ ]   components detected in this spectrum .",
    "the identification of a circumstellar component in sn1998s is not as straightforward as that for sn1978k because of the presence of a bright interstellar component .",
    "details of this identification are given in  3.5 below .",
    "extended interstellar emission is detected in our observations of 12 sne .",
    "this high detection rate ( 12 out of 16 ) is fully consistent with their being type ii sne with massive progenitors .",
    "three examples of interstellar h@xmath3 emission are presented in figure  [ fig_nosn ] .",
    "the interstellar h@xmath3 line , compared to the telluric oh and h@xmath3 lines , is broader and shows velocity variations along the slit .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we summarize the observed properties of individual objects that are interesting .",
    "sn1954j and sn1961v , in ngc2403 and ngc1058 respectively , had spectral properties similar to a type ii sn , but were peculiar in four respects : 1 ) the linewidths of sn1961v correspond to an expansion velocity of only 2000 km  s@xmath5 , 2 ) the progenitors were known , 3 ) they were underluminous , and 4 ) their sn light curves were followed in the optical for up to eight years .",
    "it has been suggested that sn1954j and sn1961v are luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) similar to @xmath15  car @xcite .    in optical and near - infrared imaging observations more recent than our echelle observations ,",
    "@xcite have identified a faint red star with a position consistent with v12 , the progenitor of sn1954j .",
    "similarly , using _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) wfpc1 images of sn1961v , @xcite have tentatively identified a faint red star with a position consistent with sn1961v . in either case , these red sources could be a post - eruption lbv , but neither observation can rule out that these sources are an unrelated red supergiant .",
    "spectroscopic observations similar to those reported in this paper are needed .",
    "our observations of sn1954j and sn1961v were based on the best coordinates for the sne that were available .",
    "while no emission from a sn or a post eruption lbv are detected in these spectra , interstellar emission red - shifted by @xmath0 20 km  s@xmath5  with respect to the systemic velocity of each host galaxy are present in the spectra .",
    "the coordinates of the candidate post - eruption lbv tentatively associated with sn1954j @xcite place it more than 2  from our 1  echelle slit center and therefore our observations do not include significant emission from this source .",
    "optical h@xmath3@xmath16 [ ] , [ ] , and [ ]  images of the vicinity of sn1961v show two regions separated by @xmath03  @xcite that are coincident with two non - thermal radio sources @xcite .",
    "the eastern source is roughly coincident with sn1961v .",
    "recent vla observations at 6  cm and 18  cm by @xcite confirm that both radio sources are non - thermal and show that sn1961v s radio emission has decayed .",
    "these observed properties are consistent with many known sne that have been recovered at radio wavelengths .",
    "our observations of sn1961v show two narrow - line ( @xmath030 km  s@xmath5 ) sources in h@xmath3  and [ ]  that are coincident with the two regions , but no broad h@xmath3 emission line is detected in 2 hrs of integration time .",
    "furthermore , we do not detect [ ]  emission that might be expected if nitrogen enriched material in an lbv ejecta nebula is present .",
    "it is possible that our slit just missed sn1961v .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig_sn1961v ] , the two radio sources are not exactly coincident with the two regions . the eastern radio source , corresponding to sn1961v and coincident with the lbv candidate identified by @xcite , is @xmath02  southwest of the core of the eastern region . since our e - w echelle slit was centered on the two regions , whose central star clusters were the only objects visible in the telescope acquisition image , the 1  slit width could have easily missed sn1961v and the lbv candidate .",
    "a host of lines are detected from sn1978k in ngc1313 ( see figure  [ fig_sn1978k ] ) .",
    "we clearly detect broad h@xmath3 , h@xmath14 , and @xmath115876 emission lines .",
    "furthermore , we have a tentative weak detection of broad [ ] @xmath116363 emission .",
    "note that the stronger [ ] @xmath116300 was not detected because it has been doppler shifted into a gap between echelle orders .",
    "in addition to broad emission lines , we detect narrow , spatially unresolved , emission from @xmath114686 , [ ] @xmath10 4959,5007 , [ ] @xmath115755 , and [ ] @xmath106548,6583 .",
    "interestingly , the [ ] @xmath106716,6731 lines are not detected .",
    "the implications of the line detections and non - detections from sn1978k will be discussed further in   [ discuss ] .",
    "we detect broad h@xmath3  emission from sn1995n ( see figure  [ fig_sndetecta ] ) , with fwzi ( full - width at zero intensity ) of @xmath03,000 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "in addition , a narrow interstellar component with fwhm @xmath030 km  s@xmath5  is present .",
    "while the interstellar emission is red - shifted by roughly 40 km  s@xmath5  from the the systemic velocity of the host galaxy arp261 , the broad h@xmath3  emission appears to be blue - shifted by @xmath0200 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "our observations of sn1997eg detect broad h@xmath3  emission with fwzi of @xmath03,500 km  s@xmath5  which is blue - shifted by @xmath0400 km  s@xmath5  with respect to the host galaxy ngc5012 .",
    "furthermore , these observations show narrow h@xmath3  and [ ] @xmath116583 emission components and possibly narrow [ ] @xmath106716,6731 emission blue - shifted by @xmath0160 km  s@xmath5  with respect to the systemic velocity of the host galaxy .",
    "the h@xmath3  and [ ]  emission are both narrow and are clearly visible throughout the echelle slit and therefore are interstellar in origin .",
    "@xcite observed sn 1997eg @xmath01 yr earlier and detected a strong , narrow , p - cygni profile caused by csm , which has completely vanished at the time of our observations .",
    "the h@xmath3  spectrum of sn1998s in ngc3877 shows a total width greater than 10,000 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "superposed on this broad component from the sn ejecta , we find a narrow h@xmath3  feature at @xmath06581    extending along the slit across the sn .",
    "the spatial distribution indicates the presence of ism in the vicinity of sn1998s .",
    "in addition we detect narrow , spatially extended , [ ] @xmath116583 and narrow , spatially unresolved [ ] @xmath104959,5007 emission ( see figure  [ fig_sn1998s ] ) .",
    "comparison between the h@xmath3  and [ ]  lines on and off the sn position does not show conclusively the existence of a circumstellar nebula .",
    "the presence of the spatially unresolved [ ]  emission indicates that there is a nebula associated with the sn progenitor .",
    "the heliocentric velocities of the narrow h@xmath3 , [ ] , and [ ]  lines extracted at the position of the sn are @xmath166 , @xmath174 , and @xmath164 km  s@xmath5 , respectively , relative to the systemic velocity of the ngc3877 .",
    "the velocity difference between the [ ]  line and the other two lines are larger than the uncertainty of the measurements , @xmath03 km  s@xmath5 , indicating that these narrow components may have a complex origin consisting of an unknown mixture of csm and ism .",
    "we can further compare our observations of sn1998s , taken @xmath01 year after its discovery , to the high dispersion spectra taken 17.4 and 36.3 days after the discovery @xcite . only the [ ]  @xmath115007 line shows continuity from one epoch to the next .",
    "the line shape changes from an asymmetric profile on day 17.4 , to a broader ( fwhm@xmath1759@xmath189 km  s@xmath5 ) and symmetric profile on day 36.3 , to a narrower ( fwhm@xmath1737@xmath183 km  s@xmath5 ) symmetric profile centered at the same velocity 1 year later . at h@xmath3 , the early nebular line had a p - cygni profile , while our spectra show the line only in emission .",
    "the most dramatic difference between the early observations and our observations is in the [ ] lines .",
    "the [ ]  lines were not detected on day 17.4 ; the auroral [ ] @xmath115755 line was observed to be at least 3 times as strong as the nebular [ ]  @xmath116583 line on day 36.3 ; 1 year later , the nebular [ ] line was detected but the auroral [ ]  line was not detected .",
    "the early line ratios indicate the presence of ionized gas denser than 10@xmath19 @xmath20 which can only be circumstellar in origin @xcite .",
    "if the narrow nebular features from all three epochs originate from the same nebula , then our observations detect the outer , low  density region of this circumstellar nebula . on the other hand",
    ", we can not rule out the possibility that the narrow , spatially unresolved spectral features we observed have a significant contribution from the ism .",
    "the galactic environment of sn1998bm is complex and it remains unclear whether it is in ngc2820 or ngc2820a .",
    "sn1998bm itself is not detected , but the interstellar emission in the echellogram appears consistent with that of an expanding shell of size @xmath0600 pc . while this interstellar emission might be from a supergiant shell , the expansion velocity , @xmath075 km  s@xmath5 , is relatively high compared to similar resolved structures in the large magellanic cloud @xcite and other galaxies @xcite . we therefore conclude that the emission lines detected are likely a superposition of the ism of both ngc2820 and ngc2820a .",
    "each of these interstellar emission components is blue - shifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the two galaxies .",
    "the brighter component ( toward the western end of the slit ) is probably associated with ngc2820a and is blue - shifted by @xmath080 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "it is less certain from which galaxy the fainter component might arise but it is blue - shifted by either @xmath0120 km  s@xmath5  or @xmath0160 km  s@xmath5  from the systemic velocity of ngc2820 and ngc2820a , respectively .",
    "our observation of sn1999e detects faint , spatially - unresolved , broad emission features throughout the entire echellogram .",
    "the high dispersion of the spectrum and the gaps between echelle orders make it difficult to identify these emission features .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that these emission features are unlike that of any stars ; therefore , we believe that the broad emission features are from the young sn1999e .",
    "in addition to the broad features , narrow interstellar h@xmath3 , h@xmath14 , and [ ] @xmath115007 emission are detected .",
    "the h@xmath3  emission detected has an average heliocentric velocity of 7,925@xmath1810 km  s@xmath5and fwhm of @xmath0100 km  s@xmath5 .",
    "both the h@xmath14  and [ ]  lines have similar redshifts and all lines have a velocity 185 km  s@xmath5  greater than the previously reported systemic velocity of the host galaxy iras13145@xmath11817 @xcite .",
    "our observation of sn1999z also detects faint , spatially - unresolved , broad emission features throughout the entire echellogram .",
    "similarly , we believe that these emission features originate from sn1999z .",
    "the h@xmath3 line is red - shifted into a gap between echelle orders but narrow interstellar components of h@xmath14 , [ ] @xmath115007 , and [ ] @xmath106716,6731 are detected .",
    "based on the two strongest lines , h@xmath14  and [ ] @xmath116716 , we find a heliocentric velocity of 15,450@xmath1810 km  s@xmath5  for the emission lines which is @xmath0350 km  s@xmath5   greater than that previously reported for ugc05608 by @xcite which were based on the apparent velocity centroid of the then newly detected sn line emission .",
    "the very last evolutionary stage of a massive star before sn explosion is not well known .",
    "it is impossible to study sn progenitors after they have exploded , but it is possible to study the csm shed by the progenitors and photoionized by uv flashes from the sne .",
    "the physical properties of these circumstellar nebulae may provide invaluable information about the doomed massive stars .    in the last hundred years",
    ", sn1987a has been the only sn observed in the local group .",
    "all the other sne are in distant galaxies , where circumstellar nebulae can only be detected in high - dispersion spectra of sne as narrow nebular lines with high [ ] /h@xmath3 ratios .",
    "the size of an unresolved circumstellar nebula can be determined if the sn is spectroscopically monitored until the sn ejecta impact the circumstellar nebula .",
    "for example , if sn1987a were at a large distance , the size of its inner ring nebula could still be determined from the 1011 years time lapse from the sn explosion to the emergence of a broader nebular component , and the 15,000 km  s@xmath5 expansion velocity of the sn ejecta inferred from its broad ly@xmath3 emission @xcite .",
    "there are apparently two types of circumstellar nebulae produced by sn progenitors .",
    "the first type of circumstellar nebulae are swept - up by sn ejecta within a year or two , as demonstrated dramatically in time - sequenced spectra for sn1988z @xcite . in the case of sn1997eg ,",
    "previous observations have shown a narrow p - cygni component to the sn spectrum @xcite which has disappeared at the time of our observations , one year later .",
    "these nebulae are small ( @xmath00.01 pc ) , and , for the case of sn1997eg , very dense ( @xmath21 @xmath20 ) .",
    "such ionized nebulae have not been observed around any known evolved massive stars .",
    "this circumstellar material may have been ejected immediately before the sn explosion @xcite or during a red supergiant phase @xcite .",
    "the second type of circumstellar nebulae are longer lived , indicating a larger size .",
    "these nebulae might be the counterparts of circumstellar nebulae observed around wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars or lbvs @xcite .",
    "for a nebular radius of 2 pc and a sn ejecta expansion velocity of 10,000 km  s@xmath5 , the impact of sn ejecta on the circumstellar nebula is expected at @xmath0200 yr after the sn explosion , and the impact will produce x - ray - luminous snrs such as the one observed in ngc6946 @xcite and the snr 0540@xmath169.3 in the large magellanic cloud @xcite .    among the sne we surveyed ,",
    "we detect csm around sn1978k and sn1998s . in the case of sn1978k ,",
    "the circumstellar nebula was not yet hit by the sn ejecta 21 years after the sn explosion .",
    "this must belong to the second type of circumstellar nebula described above . in the case of sn1998s ,",
    "the rapid temporal evolution of the spectral lines from the csm over the first year indicate that this material is interacting with the sn ejecta and must belong to the first type .",
    "our new observations of sn1978k confirm the h@xmath3  and [ ]  line emission and expansion velocity of the csm previously reported by @xcite . as",
    "this circumstellar nebula is in the second class mentioned above and ngc1313 is relatively nearby , the nebula might be large enough to be resolved by the _",
    "hst_. therefore , we obtained the _",
    "archive wfpc2 images of sn1978k taken with f656n and f606w filters on 1998 september 23 as part of program go-6713 ( pi : w. sparks ) . in these observations",
    "the sn is centered in the pc and a point - like source is detected ( see figure  [ fig_psf ] ) .",
    "also shown in figure  [ fig_psf ] are the expected point - spread - functions for position of the sn in the pc for observations with the f656n and f606w filters .",
    "these images clearly place an upper limit of 01 on the size of the circumstellar nebula of sn1978k . at the distance of the host galaxy ngc1313 , 4.5 mpc @xcite , this upper limit on the size corresponds to 2.2 pc .",
    "this small size is more consistent with the sizes of lbv nebulae than wr nebulae , as also concluded by @xcite .    in the case of sn1998s",
    ", our observations can not unambiguously determine whether the emission seen is circumstellar or interstellar .",
    "in either case , the nebular emission observed is no longer consistent with gas denser than the critical density needed for the auroral [ ]  @xmath115575 line to dominate the nebular lines .",
    "therefore , the density must be less than @xmath010@xmath22 @xmath20 and the emission seen is either from a lower density outer region of a circumstellar nebula or from interstellar material",
    ". if the narrow lines we detected are indeed circumstellar in origin , then the blueward velocity offset of the [ ] line relative to the h@xmath3  and [ ]  lines may be caused by light travel time effects similar to those used to explain the early evolution of the [ ]  line profile by @xcite .",
    "our high - dispersion ( r@xmath030,000 ) spectroscopic observations of sne have demonstrated the possibility of detecting circumstellar nebulae ejected by sn progenitors and deriving information on the progenitors from the nebular properties .",
    "our observations have also demonstrated the difficulty of such work because of the faintness of the sne and their associated circumstellar nebulae . in order to identify emission from such nebulae ,",
    "high - dispersion spectroscopic observations of sne with large telescopes such as gemini and keck are needed . only after a large number of such circumstellar nebulae",
    "have been detected and studied can we hope to better understand sn progenitors and their circumstellar environment .",
