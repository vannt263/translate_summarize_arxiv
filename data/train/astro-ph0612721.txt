    "the occurrence of various features of solar activity is not symmetric considering their manifestation in the northern and southern hemispheres of the sun .",
    "this phenomena , known as north@xmath1south ( n@xmath1s ) asymmetry , has been studied using several solar activity indices such as flares , sunspot numbers , sunspot areas , prominences & filaments , magnetic flux , coronal intensity , etc . by various authors ( newton & milson 1955 ; howard 1974 ; roy 1977 ; vizoso & ballester 1987 ; garcia 1990 ; verma 1993 ; ata & zg 1996 ; li et al .  1998 ; temmer et al .  2002 ; joshi & joshi 2004 ; knaack et al .",
    "2004 ; braja et al .  2005 ; temmer et al .",
    "these studies reveal the existence of a real n@xmath1s asymmetry that has bearing with the solar dynamo mechanism ( ossendrijver 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "a detailed analysis of n@xmath1s asymmetry has been performed with solar h@xmath0 flares that occurred during solar cycle 23 .",
    "the study covers almost full solar cycle 23 ( 1996@xmath12005 ) and is an extension of our earlier analysis ( joshi & pant 2005 ) . in section  2 ,",
    "the pattern of flare occurrence is studied with respect to heliographic latitudes and the significance of observed n@xmath1s asymmetry is evaluated using binomial probability distribution .",
    "the study also throw light on the evolution of flare activity with the progress of solar cycle .",
    "further , the comparison of asymmetric behavior of flare activity is made with sunspot numbers and areas which is presented in section 3 .",
    "the results of the study are discussed in the final section .",
    "the data used in the present study have been collected from h@xmath0 flare lists published in the sgd ( solar geophysical data ) from 01 may 1996 to 31 december 2005 , covering 10 years of solar cycle 23 . out of 21620 flares ,",
    "21608 events are selected for the study for which complete information about the heliographic location ( latitude and longitude ) was available . to study the latitudinal distribution of flares with solar cycle evolution , we compute the yearly flare counts in @xmath2 latitudinal bands ( within @xmath3 latitudes , flares above @xmath4 latitudes being very small ) in the northern and southern hemispheres from 1996 to 2005 ( table 1 ) .",
    "we find that the yearly flare counts in the northern and southern hemispheres show an asymmetry ( column 8 of table 1 ) . to evaluate the statistical significance of observed asymmetry we have used binomial probability distribution ( see joshi & pant 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "the cumulative binomial probability of getting more flares in one of the hemispheres and consequently the dominant hemisphere is also given in the table ( see columns 9 and 10 ) . in fig .",
    "[ bj - fig : ns_cum_23 ] , n@xmath1s asymmetry has been presented by plotting the cumulative counts of flares in the northern ( solid line ) and southern ( dashed line ) hemispheres during cycle 23 . the vertical distance between solid and dashed lines is a measure of northern / southern excess up to that time . to compare the n@xmath1s asymmetry observed in flares with sunspot areas and numbers",

    "we find a significant n@xmath1s asymmetry in solar flare occurrence during cycle 23 which is persistent during the course of the solar cycle .",
    "the activity dominates the northern hemisphere in general during the rising and maximum phase of the solar cycle ( i.e. , in 1997 , 1999 , and 2000 ) , while the declining phase ( i.e. , from 2001 to 2005 ) shows southern dominance .",
    "2 .   the cumulative flare counts show a southern excess in the rising phase of the cycle ( 1997 to 1999 ) , while after 1999 northern excess prevails .",
    "the northern excess first increases till mid 2001 and then decreases continuously till 2003 .",
