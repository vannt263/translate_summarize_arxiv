    "superclusters of galaxies represent the largest known conglomerations of both visible and dark matter in the universe @xcite . given the complex morphologies of superclusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as well as their huge scale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and potential alignment within the local universe @xcite , superclusters pose unique challenges for scenarios of the growth of and inter - relationship between structures on all scales , such as the hierarchical structure formation picture @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of the supercluster environment require extensive redshift information over large areas of the sky , sampling both the intra- and inter - cluster regions @xcite .",
    "wide - field , multi - fiber spectrographs are ideally suited to this task , as they permit three - dimensional probing of structures on megaparsec scales .",
    "the range of structures identified as superclusters varies widely in terms of morphology and size . on the one hand",
    "there are superclusters containing just a few major galaxy clusters connected by long spiral - rich galaxy filaments .",
    "two such examples are the coma supercluster @xcite and the nearby pisces - perseus supercluster @xcite .",
    "in contrast , other structures are perhaps more readily characterized by the presence of rich clusters , from the few in the hercules supercluster @xcite to those containing on the order of twenty major clusters , as in the case of the shapley supercluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in these latter cases , there is evidently a rich variety of substructure present in these large - scale entities .",
    "finally , @xcite have found that the superclusters within the local universe exhibit a pronounced tendency to align within the preferred plane of the virgo supercluster , representing a structure on the scale of @xmath70.1c .",
    "originally noted by shapley ( 1935 ) as exhibiting `` a considerable departure from uniform distribution , '' the horologium - reticulum supercluster ( hrs ) is now recognized as one of the largest superclusters in the local universe @xcite , containing more than twenty abell clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter aco ) .",
    "the hrs covers an area of the sky in excess of 100 square degrees , centered at approximately @xmath8 @xmath45002  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in terms of mass concentrations within 200 mpc , the hrs stands as second only to the shapley supercluster @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to note that while the shapley supercluster lies within the preferred plane discussed by @xcite , the hrs lies more than 150 mpc outside of that plane .",
    "recent studies in the hrs have focused exclusively upon the rich clusters in the region .",
    "@xcite summarize the redshift information from the eso nearby abell clusters survey ( enacs ) , which investigated aco cluster cores throughout the hrs ( specifically a3093 , a3108 , a3111 , a3112 , a3128 , a3144 , and a3158 ) .",
    "@xcite examined the merging double - cluster system a3125/a3128 , which is located in the southeast portion of the hrs .",
    "this multi - wavelength study revealed a number of rapidly infalling groups and filaments , which were accelerated by the hrs potential .",
    "the results from their observations imply that the hrs contains evolving substructures on a wide range of mass scales .    to date",
    ", no studies have been carried out that concentrate upon the dynamical state of the hrs environment outside of the rich clusters .",
    "to remedy this situation for the hrs , we have initiated a wide - field , spectroscopic study of the inter - cluster regions , and the initial results of our study are presented here .",
    "specifically , we report here on the largest scale spatial - kinematic features found in our data . in   2 , we describe the redshift sample , from the galaxy selection to the determination of optical redshifts .",
    "the four primary results of the study , all relating to large - scale kinematic features in the hrs , are presented in  3 . in   4",
    "we compare our results from the hrs with studies of the shapley supercluster , the largest mass concentration in the local universe . throughout ,",
    "the following cosmological parameters are adopted : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 kms@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , which implies a scale of 4.6 mpc degree@xmath5 ( 77 kpc arcmin@xmath5 ) at the @xmath720,000 kms@xmath5  mean redshift of the hrs .",
    "the uk schmidt telescope ( ukst ) six - degree field ( 6df ) , multi - fiber system is uniquely suited to survey large supercluster regions in the nearby universe .",
    "6df deploys 150 fibers over a circular field of diameter 6  with a minimum required spacing between fibers of 67 , set by the magnetic prism buttons .",
    "light is fed from the fibers into a fast f/0.9 ccd spectrograph @xcite .",
    "two interchangeable field plate units allow for the simultaneous observation of the current field and configuration of the next .",
    "a practical limiting magnitude for the system is b@xmath12 = 17.5 .",
    "all of these attributes taken together imply that the 6df is most effectively used to probe the large - scale inter - cluster environments of local superclusters , while avoiding the more densely crowded cluster members .",
    "consequently , in studying the hrs our goal was to produce a catalog of galaxies in the inter - cluster region .",
    "galaxy selection took place in the following manner .",
    "a 12   @xmath1 12  area of the sky centered upon @xmath135002  was chosen for the region of observation based upon previously published literature @xcite .",
    "a complete catalog of all galaxies down to a b@xmath12 magnitude of 17.5 was extracted in four equivalent ( 6@xmath1 6 ) regions from the ukst survey plates previously scanned by the supercosmos machine @xcite .",
    "there was also the addition of a fifth rectangular region ( 3@xmath1 6 ) in the far southern portion to incorporate the field surrounding aco clusters 3106 and 3164 .",
    "the galaxy classification flag assigned by supercosmos was used for the initial sample selection .",
    "the b@xmath14 magnitude limit was adopted as a practical limiting magnitude for the 1.2-m aperture ukst . to avoid expending fibers on galaxies within clusters , our original intention was to excise from the catalog all galaxies within a 1@xmath15 radius circle of sixteen aco clusters listed by @xcite as members of the hrs and intersecting our observing region .",
    "the 1@xmath15 radius exclusion corresponds to @xmath72 abell radii ( where 1 r@xmath16 2 mpc ) at the mean redshift of the hrs .",
    "this would ensure that new spectroscopic information relates only to the inter - cluster regions of the hrs .",
    "however , a coding error was discovered in the program that excises galaxies from the cluster regions only after the observations were made . the @xmath17(@xmath18 ) conversion factor in the right ascension ( ra ) coordinate , when expressed in degrees ,",
    "was not included in the calculation of angular distances of galaxies from cluster centers . as a result ,",
    "the actual excision regions are flattened in the ra coordinate and correspondingly more flattened at higher declination .",
    "the typical flattening is a factor of 1.6 .",
    "nevertheless , the result remains that we have generated a sample that is almost entirely comprised of inter - cluster galaxies .",
    "after the above constraints were applied , there remained 2848 galaxies ( figure [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the maximum number of optical galaxy redshifts that could be obtained under optimal observing conditions was estimated at 1500 .",
    "consequently , we produced a subcatalog of 1500 targets from the original list of 2848 .",
    "this was accomplished as follows .",
    "galaxies in each 6@xmath1 6  region were assigned a random number and then arranged in ascending order .",
    "this ordering provides a basis for selecting an unbiased subsample from the larger complete sample .",
    "the numbering schemes from the individual 6@xmath1 6  regions were merged into a final catalog of 1500 objects with each region weighted according to the fraction of galaxies found in that region .",
    "that is , if 25% of the galaxies in the original catalog came from a particular region , the subcatalog of 1500 galaxies also contained 25% from that region .",
    "hence the method preserves natural galaxy overdensities while randomly sampling the entire extracted region .",
    "finally , a digitized sky survey ( dss ) image of each target was examined to further reduce the number of misclassified galaxies in the sample .",
    "observations covering the 12@xmath1 14  area in the hrs were carried out on the 1.2 m ukst of the anglo - australian observatory ( aao ) in 2002 october / november .",
    "all observations were carried out as part of the 6df galaxy survey ( 6dfgs ) program being undertaken by the aao @xcite .",
    "specifically , the 6dfgs and our hrs program observations were folded together to allow for joint execution of both programs . when allocating fibers , the 1500 galaxies in the study were given highest priority within the 6dfgs for the selected fields of observation . however , whenever a 6df fiber became unassigned due to a conflict with the fiber selection from another target galaxy , the fiber was then reassigned to a target from the 6dfgs lists .",
    "the blue magnitude limit for the 6dfgs is 16.75 ( i.e. , b@xmath19 16.75 ) , hence there is considerable overlap between our target lists and the 6dfgs .",
    "over all the observed fields , approximately 70% of all targets were taken from our original list of 1500 galaxies .",
    "noticeable from figure [ f2 ] , our observed galaxy magnitude distribution closely follows the magnitude distribution of the post - extraction hrs area of 2848 galaxies . due to the brighter limiting magnitude of 6dfgs",
    ", we have slightly less proportional coverage at our faint limit .",
    "in addition , a few very faint objects were included as part of the 6dfgs , which again can be seen in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "finally , a small number of 6dfgs objects lie within our 1  excision radii around clusters , which is evident in figure [ f1 ] .",
    "observations and reductions were carried out along standard 6dfgs procedures , which are briefly summarized in the next section .",
    "eight nights were allocated to this project by the 6dfgs team , but three were adversely affected by weather ( table [ tb1 ] ) .",
    "we used a combination of the 580v and 425r volume - phase holographic transmission gratings to optimize spectral coverage .",
    "this procedure yielded an instrumental resolution of 4.9   ( 580v ) and 6.6   ( 425r ) , while covering the wavelength range 3900 @xmath4 7600  , i.e. , from [ oii]@xmath203727 through h@xmath21 over the hrs redshift range .",
    "exposure times for each grating are listed in table [ tb1 ] .",
    "hgcdne arc and quartz flat exposures were carried out before and after primary fields .",
    "547 usable galaxy spectra were obtained from the eight nights allocated ( table [ shorttb2 ] ) . in figure",
    "[ f1 ] , individual field centers are labeled and shown in reference to the survey area . altogether , 100 fibers were operational during our sequence of observations . with 9 fibers donated to sky ,",
    "this leaves a total of 91 possible galaxy redshifts per imaged field .",
    "night 7 with the 580v grating was not reduced due to a telescope focus error , so redshifts were obtained for only 25% of the 0811 field ( table [ tb1 ] ) .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio was relatively low in many of our spectra ( @xmath22 10 ) , over 95% yielded reliable redshifts ( excluding 0811 ) . due to 6dfgs priorities and galaxy overcrowding ,",
    "redshifts were obtained for some galaxies not originally included in our source lists . there remained 3 galactic stars and 27 objects with unusable spectra in the sample .",
    "the automatic 6df data reduction ( 6dfdr ) package completes the following steps directly after observation : debiasing , fiber extraction , cosmic - ray removal , flat fielding , sky subtraction , and wavelength calibration @xcite .",
    "as a final step , the post-6dfdr files from each exposure were co - added into single spectra .",
    "methods for the determination of galaxy redshifts fit into three basic categories depending on their spectral characteristics : absorption , emission , and those spectra containing both absorption and emission features . for spectra exhibiting absorption features , the iraf based cross - correlation package , rvsao , was utilized to determine radial velocities against four template spectra : two stellar spectra obtained from the coud feed spectral library @xcite and two spectra obtained from the sample ( a galactic star and a nearby galaxy whose redshift was also determined by rvsao ) .",
    "the method of determining redshifts for emission - dominated galaxy spectra was completed in two steps .",
    "first , jar and mcf independently measured wavelength centers for each detectable spectral line via gaussian fitting then determined its redshift .",
    "second , each emission line was assigned a weight by mcf based upon the sharpness of the line and the surrounding noise level .",
    "the assigned weight was based upon a 5 point scale , where a `` 5 '' denoted a peak height greater than three times the fwhm with minimal background . for expected emission lines that were faintly detectable from the background , a weighting of",
    "`` 1 '' was assigned .",
    "this appropriately distinguished between emission lines with robust redshift determinations from those compromised by noise .",
    "redshifts were averaged for galaxy spectra exhibiting both strong emission and absorption features .",
    "whenever there was a discrepancy of @xmath23 kms@xmath5  between the two methods , preference was given to the emission line value .",
    "as a last step , heliocentric corrections were applied to all redshifts .      outside the previously determined cluster areas that were excised ,",
    "there were 2848 potential targets selected by supercosmos ( galaxies with b@xmath24 17.5 ) .",
    "it was determined from a comparable sub - sample selection that @xmath715% of the targets labeled as ` galaxies ' by supercosmos were actually stars .",
    "therefore , the completeness of the survey is 547/2420 , or 23% .",
    "the optical redshifts obtained in this survey more than double the previously published information regarding the proposed supercluster field ( figure [ f3 ] ) .",
    "previous inter - cluster observations were limited both spatially ( primarily focused in the southeast portion of the supercluster ) and also by magnitude .",
    "overlap with previously observed galaxies was not intended , but in general , most of the 6df redshifts are consistent with previous estimates within the combined errors .",
    "it is noticeable from figure [ f1 ] that the coverage is not uniform over the original 12@xmath1 14   area .",
    "in fact , the total area covered by the observations is more accurately 9@xmath1 14 .",
    "furthermore , the galaxies in the western portion are more heavily sampled than those in the east .",
    "this non - uniformity is primarily a result of the weather problems coupled with the competing demands of both hrs and 6dfgs surveys when selecting field centers for the observations .",
    "although the mean completeness is 23% , the field centers in the western portion are sampled closer to 28% completeness , while the eastern field centers are at @xmath722% .",
    "we begin by briefly considering the kinematic extent of the hrs .",
    "while a supercluster clearly will not be in a state of dynamical equilibrium with well - defined boundaries , we establish provisional kinematic limits from previous studies of the horologium - reticulum ( hr ) cluster population .",
    "specifically , two separate studies applied a friends - of - friends analysis to the aco clusters within the hr region and identified between 18 and 24 clusters as related to the hrs @xcite . within our region of observation ,",
    "seventeen aco clusters were combined from these two catalogs ( column 4 , table [ tb3 ] ) .",
    "the mean redshift of these clusters is 19,900 kms@xmath5 , with a dispersion @xmath25 of 2300 kms@xmath5 .",
    "we define the `` kinematic core '' of the hrs to be roughly bounded by the fwhm of the observed redshift distribution of aco clusters , namely 5400 kms@xmath5 . when rounded to the nearest 500 kms@xmath5 , we determine the core of the hrs to be between @xmath26 of 17,000 and 22,500 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the above kinematic extent of @xmath75500 kms@xmath5  is basically consistent with the fact that the @xcite and @xcite analyses find the hrs to contain @xmath720 major galaxy clusters . assuming a mean cluster mass of 10@xmath27 and the cosmological parameters stated in  1 , we calculate the spherical hubble flow volume required to contain a mass of 20 such clusters . the calculated diameter of that volume ( 95 mpc ) does indeed correspond to a velocity spread of @xmath76500 kms@xmath5 , i.e. , similar to our defined kinematic limits .",
    "the adopted boundaries for the hrs are examined with respect to both the distribution of cluster redshifts and the distribution of 6df inter - cluster galaxy redshifts in figure [ f4 ] . for inset ( a ) ,",
    "all galaxy clusters with known redshifts in the region ( table [ tb3 ] ) are plotted , including the seventeen aco clusters considered above .",
    "although the redshift histogram for the inter - cluster galaxies is clearly clumped into several redshift concentrations , the main concentration of galaxies ( @xmath748% of the sample ) lies within the selected hrs kinematic boundaries . as shown in figure [ f4](b ) , the hrs kinematic core is bordered by a depletion in galaxy numbers both at lower ( 14,000 @xmath4 16,000 kms@xmath5 ) and higher ( 22,500 @xmath4 24,000 kms@xmath5 ) redshift ranges . while the higher redshift limit to the hrs near cz = 22,500 kms@xmath5  is quite well defined ,",
    "the lower redshift limit is less clearly defined .",
    "specifically , there is a clump of galaxies present between 16,000 and 17,000 kms@xmath5 , which is not included in our definition of the hrs `` core '' .",
    "the nature of the inter - cluster galaxies in this redshift regime is further clarified in figure [ f5 ] , where we plot coordinate versus redshift in both @xmath21 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that the galaxies between 16,000 and 17,000 kms@xmath5  in redshift are highly concentrated in @xmath18 at @xmath2854 .",
    "these same galaxies are more substantially spread in @xmath21 , although confined to the western side of the hrs .",
    "we return to this component of the hrs in subsequent sections .",
    "our extensive new redshift database allows us to calculate the mean galaxy overdensity in the _ inter - cluster _ regions of the hrs .",
    "the expected galaxy counts for a uniform distribution are based on estimates of the local galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) . to facilitate the comparison between the hrs and the ssc",
    ", we follow as closely as possible the methods described by @xcite .",
    "specifically , the expected number of galaxy counts as a function of redshift and limiting magnitude are calculated from the same @xcite galaxy lf as used by @xcite in their calculation of the overdensity in the ssc .",
    "the resulting function is plotted as a solid curve in figure [ f4 ] , with an assumed limiting magnitude of b@xmath12 = 17.5 . to calculate the expected number of galaxies within the hrs redshift and angular limits",
    ", we adopted the previously established redshift limits of 17000 @xmath4 22500 kms@xmath5 , and assumed the 9  @xmath1 14  = 126 deg@xmath29 areal coverage of our survey .",
    "however , the latter figure required reduction to 107 deg@xmath29 , due to the areas excised around clusters .",
    "finally , we observed only 23% of the total number of galaxies brighter than b@xmath12 of 17.5 within the 107 deg@xmath29 .",
    "of the observed galaxies , @xmath748% fall within the redshift limits of the hrs . taking these factors into account , we arrive at a mean density of 2.4:1 for the inter - cluster regions of the hrs ( assuming that light traces mass ) . in following a common definition of the galaxy overdensity",
    ", we find that @xmath30 1.4 , where @xmath31 .",
    "given the rather uncertain redshift and angular boundaries of the hrs , as well as uncertainty in the shape and normalization of the local lf , we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath725% in the overdensity .      having examined the overall redshift histograms for both clusters and inter - cluster galaxies ,",
    "we now utilize two - dimensional redshift slices of our 6df data as a further means of assessing the dynamical state of the hrs . in figure",
    "[ f6 ] , we present a sequence of redshift cuts through the kinematic extent of the hrs , each cut containing a redshift bin size of 1500 kms@xmath5 .",
    "an examination of figure [ f6 ] gives the impression of a systematic trend between spatial position in the hrs and redshift .",
    "specifically , we note that galaxies in panel ( a ) ( 17,000 @xmath4 18,500 kms@xmath5 ) appear preferentially located in the south and east , while the galaxies in panel ( d ) ( 21,500 @xmath4 23,000 kms@xmath5 ) preferentially populate the west and north . in other words",
    ", there appears to be a trend of systematically increasing redshift along a principal axis in the hrs that extends from the southeast to the northwest end of the supercluster .",
    "to quantify the significance of a large - scale redshift trend with spatial position in the hrs , we conducted a correlation analysis as a function of position angle ( pa ) on the sky .",
    "to begin , we selected the center of the hrs to be at ( @xmath32 ) and assumed the principal axis of the hrs to be aligned along the west - east direction .",
    "each galaxy was projected onto this principal axis , and we defined the _",
    "s_-coordinate to be the projected angular position of the galaxy along the assumed principal axis .",
    "furthermore , the _",
    "s_-coordinate was defined to run negative to positive from west to east .",
    "a linear regression analysis was carried out between the redshift and the _ s_-coordinate , which yields both the correlation coefficient , _ r _ , and the likelihood that the null hypothesis ( _ no _ correlation between redshift and projected _ s _ position ) is correct ( bevington 1969 ) .",
    "we repeated the correlation analysis at 5  increments in position angle ( pa ) of the assumed principal axis over the full 180range .",
    "when the assumed principal axis is running from se to nw , positive _ s _ values are in the nw . in the same way ,",
    "when the assumed principal axis is running from sw to ne , positive _ s _ values in the ne .",
    "the correlation analysis was completed both for the 263 6df inter - cluster galaxies with redshifts between 17,000 and 22,500 kms@xmath5  and for the 21 clusters with mean redshifts over the same interval .    for both clusters and inter - cluster galaxies , we find that the null hypothesis is rejected at probability ( p ) levels of p@xmath33 . at certain pas ,",
    "the plots of @xmath34 versus pa show a broad peak over an interval of 20 @xmath4  40 .",
    "6df galaxies show the highest correlation coefficient ( _ r _ = 0.3 ) and lowest probability for the null hypothesis ( p@xmath2210@xmath35 ) at a pa @xmath36 @xmath480  ( as measured east from north ) .",
    "the clusters also show a significant correlation , with a peak at a pa of @xmath450 . in figure",
    "[ f7 ] , we show the projected _ s _ position plotted versus redshift for all inter - cluster galaxies and clusters with redshift between 17,000 and 22,500 kms@xmath5  at a pa of @xmath480 . the expected cluster",
    "peculiar velocities are suppressed for clarity of the inter - cluster galaxy distribution .",
    "the linear regression fit for the inter - cluster galaxies is plotted as a solid line .",
    "note that the best fit line actually passes through a zone of low galaxy density ; this is examined further in  3.4 .",
    "we are now in a position to revisit the substantial population of galaxies from 16,000 to 17,000 kms@xmath5 .",
    "to determine whether or not these galaxies are associated with the large - scale redshift trend , we repeat the correlation analysis as a function of pa now expanding the redshift range to 16,000 @xmath4 22,500 kms@xmath5 .",
    "when the galaxies between 16,000 and 17,000 kms@xmath5  are included , the correlation coefficient is weakened ( _ r _ = 0.2 ) , and the probability of no correlation increases to p@xmath710@xmath37 .",
    "the deviation of the 16,000 @xmath4 17,000 kms@xmath5  galaxies from the redshift trend is evident in their spatial segregation ( especially in @xmath18 ) .",
    "we display the spatial location of these galaxies on the sky in figure [ f8 ] , where the galaxies from 16,000 @xmath418,000 kms@xmath5are separated into 1000 kms@xmath5  slices .",
    "although the galaxies from 16,000 @xmath417,000 kms@xmath5  only represent @xmath75% of the total population , the spatial segregation of this clump does not follow the overall trend of the higher redshift galaxies in the hrs and provides a significant lever arm by which the best fit correlation axis is altered . in short , while the spatially - localized galaxies from 16,000 @xmath4  17,000 kms@xmath5  may reside within the hrs , they do not appear to follow the large - scale redshift trend established by the clusters and inter - cluster galaxies over the range 17,000 @xmath4  22,500 kms@xmath5 .",
    "as noted above , the best linear fit between projected _ s _ coordinate and redshift actually runs through a zone of low galaxy density ( figure [ f7 ] ) .",
    "the implication is that the hrs has a bi - modal redshift distribution , i.e. , the hrs kinematic extent consists of two major components in redshift .",
    "the redshift bi - modality of the hrs is most clearly observed by fitting and removing the systematic spatial - redshift trend at pa @xmath3880 , then plotting the histogram of residual redshifts , as shown in figure [ f9 ] .",
    "fitting each component of the histogram with a gaussian reveals that the overall number of galaxies is roughly equal in the two components , which are separated by @xmath72500 kms@xmath5  ( 35 mpc ) .",
    "however , the fwhm of the higher - redshift component ( i.e. , corresponding to the galaxies with original redshift centered at @xmath721,000 kms@xmath5 ) is approximately twice as large as for the lower redshift component , 2200 and 1100 kms@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the two components show no spatial distinction from each other and are spread throughout the entire observed region of the hrs .",
    "to quantify the likelihood of bi - modality in the redshift distribution , we first assess the likelihood that a single gaussian provides an adequate fit to the data . at each pa , we determine the residual redshift of all galaxies from the systematic position - redshift trend , and then we employ kmm statistics to assess the likelihood of a two - gaussian versus a single - gaussian fit @xcite . for",
    "_ all _ position angles , a common covariance , two - gaussian fit is preferred to a single gaussian with a high degree of confidence ( @xmath39 99% ) .",
    "the average peak - to - peak separation of the two components over the entire pa range is 3014 @xmath40 712 kms@xmath5 , with the separation along the best - fit line ( pa@xmath3880 ) being 3003 @xmath40 174 kms@xmath5 .",
    "next , we utilize @xmath41 statistics to test the goodness - of - fit for two gaussian distributions with differing fwhm as a function of pa .",
    "the reduced @xmath41 values range from 0.95 to 4.91 with the best fit value at pa@xmath3860 . in summary ,",
    "the statistical tests confirm the bi - modal nature of the hrs redshift distribution , with the clearest distinction between the two redshift components occurring along the principal spatial - redshift axis of the supercluster .",
    "finally , we have utilized the same kmm statistical methods to assess the redshift distribution of clusters in the hrs with known redshift . for the clusters ,",
    "the best fit correlation axis was found at pa@xmath3850 .",
    "however when considering the broad nature of the correlation@xmath4pa relationship for clusters , we used the best fit line from the inter - cluster galaxies at a pa of @xmath480  ( cf . , figure [ f7 ] ) .",
    "we fitted the systematic position - redshift trend of the galaxies and found the residual mean redshift for each cluster from that trend .",
    "the resulting histogram of cluster residual redshift was plotted in figure [ f9 ] ( right ) .",
    "we then applied kmm statistics to the cluster histogram . unlike the test on the galaxies , the cluster histogram showed no clear signature of a bi - modal redshift distribution",
    "specifically , the cluster redshifts fitted a bi - modal distribution with @xmath775% confidence as compared to a single gaussian distribution .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure [ f9 ] ( right ) , the cluster redshift data were sparse and little could be concluded from their redshift distribution .",
    "the hrs is generally referred to as the second largest supercluster within 200 mpc , second only in mass to the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) @xcite . since the ssc is both well - studied and the most comparable supercluster in the local universe , we use it as a benchmark for assessing the properties of the hrs . the comparison between these two largest structures is somewhat hindered by the fact that most of the ssc studies combine inter - cluster and cluster galaxies , while our 6df data for the hrs samples only the inter - cluster galaxies .",
    "we begin by comparing the kinematic extent of the hrs ( from 17,000 to 22,500 kms@xmath5 ) with that of the ssc .",
    "the velocity boundaries of the entire ssc are generally cited as extending from 8,000 to 18,000 kms@xmath5@xcite . to put the ssc on the same quantitative footing as the hrs",
    ", we compare the cluster populations of the two superclusters .",
    "specifically , when compared with the 18 aco clusters found in the hrs by @xcite , the same authors find 24 aco clusters in the ssc , while @xcite find 25 .",
    "hence the numbers of clusters in the ssc are comparable to , perhaps slightly larger than , those in the hrs .",
    "for the 24 aco clusters combined from these studies , we used published mean redshift data from @xcite to calculate a comparative kinematic extent for the ssc .",
    "we determine the fwhm of the redshift distribution of the ssc clusters to be @xmath76000 kms@xmath5 , very similar to the @xmath75500 kms@xmath5  found for the hrs . as is discussed below ,",
    "the redshift distribution of the ssc clusters is distinctly bi - modal , thus the fwhm metric is rather an oversimplification of a complex environment .",
    "however , the basic result is that the hrs and ssc are similar in regard to their total number of aco clusters and overall kinematic extent .",
    "next , we seek to make a valid comparison between the inter - cluster overdensities of the ssc and the hrs .",
    "three studies have examined in detail the inter - cluster overdensity of the ssc @xcite . of these",
    ", only @xcite considers a similar area on the sky , so we draw a comparison with this study .",
    "the ssc inter - cluster overdensity is 3.3 @xmath40 0.1 over 151 deg@xmath29 , as compared with an overdensity of 2.4 that we find for the hrs .",
    "a radius of 0.5  ( @xmath7 2 mpc at ssc mean redshift ) was excised around aco clusters within the survey area .",
    "this radius in the ssc corresponds to 0.35  at the hrs redshift .",
    "consequently , the hrs sample is slightly more restrictive in selecting only inter - cluster galaxies , but this is likely a small difference .",
    "overall , we find a somewhat smaller , but similar , overdensity in the hrs compared to that in the ssc .",
    "in addition , we compare the total mass in the hrs inter - cluster galaxies to that in the ssc . given the differences between the hrs and ssc studies in overdensity ( 2.4/3.3 ) , angular survey region ( 107/151 deg@xmath29 ) , and relative distance ( @xmath7 20,000/15,000 kms@xmath5 ) , we conclude that the total masses of the inter - cluster regions of the hrs and ssc are virtually identical . thus our data indeed support the conclusion of previous studies of the distribution of galaxy clusters @xcite that the ssc and hrs constitute the two largest mass concentrations in the local universe .      in  3.2 , we found an overall spatial - redshift trend in the hrs , in that a systematic increase in redshift is present with increasing position along a se@xmath4nw axis .",
    "bardelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have fitted a plane in ( @xmath21 , @xmath18 , @xmath26 ) space to their inter - cluster observations in the ssc .",
    "they note a @xmath73000 kms@xmath5  increase in average galaxy velocity along the best fit plane over the 8  ( 40 mpc ) region , a result reminiscent of the position - redshift tilt in the hrs",
    ". however , when the area on the sky is expanded ( cf . , figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to include the inter - cluster galaxies in @xcite , the main peak of the galaxy distribution shifts by 7 mpc , and the entire distribution is broadened . in short ,",
    "while there appears to be a kinematic gradient in the ssc , it is not clear whether that feature extends over the entire region of the supercluster .    as is discussed in  3.3 , when the spatial - redshift trend along the pa=@xmath480  axis in the hrs is fitted and removed , the redshift distribution is bi - modal ( figure [ f9 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the bi - modal signature is observed even in the original redshift histogram in figure [ f4 ] .",
    "redshift bi - modality is also strikingly evident in the ssc ( cf .",
    ", figure 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5 ) . there is a lower redshift component to the ssc ( at @xmath78,000 @xmath4 12,000 kms@xmath5 ) that is quite distinct from the higher component at @xmath714,000 @xmath4 18,000 kms@xmath5 .",
    "while it was originally thought that the ssc redshift components are substantially different in size , an extensive follow - up study by @xcite reveals the _ inter - cluster _ populations of the two components to be roughly equal ( cf .",
    ", figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the distribution of the _ clusters _ within the ssc is also bi - modal and more heavily weighted to the higher redshift component at 13,000 @xmath4 18,000 kms@xmath5 .",
    "specifically , 16 clusters have redshifts above 13,500 kms@xmath5 , while only 6 have redshifts below 12,500 kms@xmath5 .",
    "the higher redshift component coincides with what is designated by @xcite as the collapsing `` central region , '' centered on the cluster a3558 . as a result ,",
    "the higher redshift component dominates when both the cluster and inter - cluster galaxies are considered .",
    "more reliable redshift data for the clusters in the hrs is probably required before a definitive statement can be made about their redshift distribution , but the available data ( cf .",
    ", figure [ f9 ] , right panel ) indicate that such a 3:1 imbalance in cluster numbers between lower and higher redshift components is not present .",
    "although our observations reveal a distinct arrangement of field galaxies marking the hrs , the extent and/or boundaries of the supercluster are not easily determined .",
    "in fact , percolation and friends - of - friends algorithms include other clusters in the hrs besides those listed in table [ tb3 ] @xcite .",
    "recent studies of the ssc cover a similar area on the sky and also leave some ambiguity as to the spatial and kinematic extent of the supercluster @xcite .",
    "it is quite possible that the boundaries of the hrs extend beyond the region surveyed by us with 6df .",
    "we have obtained optical redshift data for 547 inter - cluster galaxies in the region of the horologium - reticulum supercluster ( hrs ) .",
    "this extensive coverage of the inter - cluster galaxies provides an opportunity to define large - scale kinematic structures within the hrs .",
    "our initial result is the detection of a main concentration of inter - cluster galaxies from 17,000 @xmath4 22,500 kms@xmath5 , which we refer to as the hrs kinematic extent .",
    "this was followed by the comparison of our observations with a smooth , homogeneous galaxy distribution .",
    "an overdensity of 2.4 was calculated , or @xmath42 1.4 , which reveals that the hrs complex has entered the non - linear regime . through visual inspection of redshift slices ,",
    "reinforced with correlation analysis , the galaxies within the kinematic extent are found to exhibit a significant trend in redshift with position along a se@xmath4nw axis in the sense that redshift increases by @xmath71500 kms@xmath5  along this axis . furthermore , the resulting position angle of the trend is closely aligned with that found in the clusters within the hrs . in addition , when the kinematic trend found above is accounted for and removed , we find a distinct bi - modality to the redshift distribution of the inter - cluster galaxies within the hrs .",
    "thus , the hrs can be viewed as consisting of two major components in redshift space , separated by 2500 kms@xmath5  ( 35 mpc ) , each with a similar position - redshift tilt at the same position angle .",
