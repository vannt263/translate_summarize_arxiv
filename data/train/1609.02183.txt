    "a trustworthy non - lte treatment is the current challenge for accurate stellar abundances .",
    "high - precision atomic data for selected lines is important for this development ( lind _ et al _ 2012 ) .    in the case of cobalt ,",
    "a big effort was recently made by lawler _",
    "et al _ ( 2015 ) to provide improved oscillator strengths for about 900 lines belonging to the first spectrum ( ) .",
    "these were deduced from emission branching fractions measured from hollow cathode lamp spectra recorded using a fourier transform spectrometer and a high - resolution echelle spectrograph combined with radiative lifetimes determined by the time - resolved laser - induced fluorescence ( tr - lif ) technique .    concerning the second spectrum ( ) ,",
    "several papers have reported experimental determinations of radiative data .",
    "lifetime measurements have been performed by pinnington _",
    "et al _ ( 1974 ) and srensen ( 1979 ) using the beam - foil technique and by salih _",
    "et al _ ( 1985 ) and mullman _ et al _",

    "theoretical data have been published by raassen _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) who computed oscillator strengths for a large number of lines using the method of orthogonal operators .",
    "however , all these studies were limited to radiative decays from the odd - parity 3d@xmath14p configuration to lower states belonging to the 3d@xmath6 and 3d@xmath14s even - parity configurations .",
    "more extensive calculations are reported by kurucz ( 2011 ) .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to extend the knowledge of radiative data to higher energy states and to provide a consistent set of transition rates for a large number of spectral lines in singly ionized cobalt .",
    "more precisely , new experimental lifetime measurements were performed by tr - lif for 12 energy levels belonging to the 3d@xmath14p odd - parity configuration and 7 energy levels belonging to the 3d@xmath14d even - parity configuration using one- and two - step excitations , respectively .",
    "in addition , transition probabilities and oscillator strengths were computed for 5080 lines in a wide spectral region , from ultraviolet to infrared , using a pseudo - relativistic hartree - fock model including core - polarization effects .",
    "the experimental set - up for one- and two - step experiments at the lund high power laser facility has recently been described in detail ( engstrm _ et al _ 2014 , lundberg _ et al _ 2016 ) . for an overview",

    "the co@xmath0 ions were produced by focusing 10 ns long pulses from a frequency doubled nd : yag laser onto a rotating co target placed in a vacuum chamber where the pressure was about 10@xmath7 mbar .",
    "the co plasma created in the ablation process was crossed by one or two laser beams 5 mm above the target .",
    "both laser systems consisted of a frequency doubled nd : yag laser ( continuum ny-82 ) pumping a continuum nd - 60 dye laser , mostly operating with dcm dye . for the wavelengths above 225",
    "nm the second ( or only ) laser used oxazin dye instead . in all measurements the final output from the dye lasers was frequency tripled using kdp and bbo crystals .",
    "the pulse length from the first laser was 10 ns , whereas for the second ( or only ) laser we achieved a pulse length after tripling of about 1 ns by injection seeding and compressing the output from the nd : yag laser .",
    "the compressor utilized stimulated brillouin scattering in water .",
    "the fluorescence emitted by the co@xmath0 ions was dispersed by a 1/8 m grating monochromator , with its 0.1 mm wide entrance slit oriented parallel to the excitation laser beam , registered by a fast micro - channel - plate photomultiplier tube ( hamamatsu r3809u ) and finally digitized by a tektronix dpo 7254 oscilloscope .",
    "the oscilloscope , with 2.5 ghz analog band width , sampled the decay in 50 ps intervals .",
    "all measurements used the second spectral order , giving an observed line width of about 0.5 nm . the excitation laser pulse shape was recorded simultaneously using a fast photo diode and digitized in a second channel on the oscilloscope .",
    "the final decay curves and pulse shape were obtained by averaging over 1000 laser pulses .",
    "the code decfit ( palmeri _ et al _ 2008 ) was then used to extract the lifetimes by fitting a single exponential function convoluted by the measured shape of the second - step laser pulse and a background function to the observed decay .",
    "table 1 gives the wavelengths for the excitation and detection channels used in the single - step measurements .",
    "all two - step excitations started from the 3d@xmath14p z@xmath8g@xmath9 level at 47346 @xmath3 , and the excitation and detection channels used are listed in table 2 .",

    "when comparing the results obtained with our computational approach with the previously published decay rates , we find an overall good agreement .",
    "this is illustrated in figures 25 , where our calculations are compared with the experimental data reported by salih _",
    "et al _ ( 1985 ) , crespo lpez - urrutia _ et al _",
    "( 1994 ) , mullman _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) and the those obtained theoretically by raassen _ et al _ ( 1998 ) .",
    "more precisely , as shown in figure 2 , we obtain a mean ratio of 1.036 @xmath14 0.205 when comparing our transition probabilities with those of salih _ et al _ ( 1985 ) , who combined lifetime values obtained by tr - lif with branching fractions measured on spectra recorded with the 1-m fourier - transform spectrometer at the kitt peak national observatory , to deduce the decay rates for 41 transitions depopulating the 3d@xmath14p z@xmath8f , z@xmath8d and z@xmath8 g levels .",
    "figure 3 shows a slighly larger scatter between our calculations and the transition probabilities published by crespo lpez - urrutia _ et al _ ( 1994 ) . here",
    "the mean ratio @xmath15/@xmath16 is equal to 1.098 @xmath14 0.493 .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the @xmath17-values obtained by the latter authors were deduced from the combination of branching ratio measurements with available experimental lifetimes for the 3d@xmath14p z@xmath8f , z@xmath8d , z@xmath8 g levels pinnington _ et al _ 1973 , 1974 , salih _ et al _ 1985 ) but also with estimated lifetimes for the z@xmath18 g , z@xmath18f and z@xmath18d levels from the measurement of total intensity of all lines of each of these levels under the assumption of almost equal population .",
    "the branching fractions were found using intensity measurements with a special hollow electrode r.f .",
    "discharge and using a phase method with a modified wall - stabilized arc in a spectro - interferometric arrangement .",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) reported 28 oscillator strengths for ultraviolet lines deduced from laser - induced fluorescence lifetimes and branching fraction measurements using a high resolution grating spectrometer and an optically thin hollow cathode discharge .",
    "as illustrated in figure 4 , our @xmath19-values were found to agree in general within 2030 % with the results obtained by mullman _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) .",
    "more particularly , the mean ratio @xmath20/@xmath21 was found to be equal to 1.339 @xmath14 0.552 when using all the common lines , and to 1.238 @xmath14 0.411 when using the strongest transitions for which log @xmath19 @xmath13 -1 .",
    "finally , figure 5 shows the comparison between our computed oscillator strengths and those published by raassen _",
    "et al _ ( 1998 ) who used the theoretical method of orthogonal operators to determine the log @xmath19-values for ( 3d@xmath6 + 3d@xmath14s )  3d@xmath14p transitions in . in this case , the two sets of data generally agree within about 20% , this percentage difference being reduced to 12% when considering the most intense transitions with log @xmath19 @xmath13 -1 .",
    "we also note that our oscillator strengths are on average larger than those obtained by raassen _",
    "et al_. this could be due to the fact that these latter authors included explicitly a less extended set of interacting configurations in their model .",
    "transition probabilities and oscillator strengths have been obtained for 5080 spectral lines in using the pseudo - relativistic hartree - fock method including the most important intravalence correlation and core - polarization effects .",
    "the accuracy of the new data has been assessed through detailed comparisons with previously published experimental and theoretical radiative rates together with new lifetime measurements performed in the present work using the laser - induced fluorescence technique with one- and two - step excitations . in view of the overall agreement obtained between all sets of results",
    ", it is expected that the new @xmath17- and @xmath19-values should be accurate to a few percent for the strongest transitions and to within 2030% for weaker lines .",
