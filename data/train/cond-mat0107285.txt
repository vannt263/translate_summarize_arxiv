    "in this article we study quantum properties of systems which present transport behavior such as normal diffusion in the classical limit . for classical systems ,",

    ", the escape rate given by the leading pollicott - ruelle resonance , determines the diffusion coefficient of the system in the large - system limit .",
    "since the classical time evolution is a good approximation of the quantum evolution in the so - called semiclassical regime , one expects that kinetic properties such as the escape rate and the diffusion coefficient will emerge out of the quantum dynamics .",
    "connections between the quantum scattering resonances and the classical diffusive behavior are also expected because , for open quantum systems , the quantum scattering resonances determine the time evolution of the wavefunction .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore these kinetic phenomena in model systems known as quantum graphs .",
    "these systems have similar spectral statistics of energy levels as the classically chaotic systems @xcite . since the pioneering work by kottos and smilansky , several studies have been devoted to the spectral properties of quantum graphs @xcite and to their applications in mesoscopic physics @xcite .",

    "thanks to their simplicity , the quantum graphs turn out to be good models to study the quantum properties of systems which present transport properties such as diffusion in the classical limit .",
    "these properties have been previously studied in systems like the kicked rotor which has a classical dynamics ( given by the standard map ) presenting deterministic diffusion for some values of the parameters .",
    "in particular , the decay of the quantum staying probability , for an open version of the kicked rotor , has been compared to the classical decay obtained numerically from the simulation of trajectories of the corresponding open standard map @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the decay observed in the quantum staying probability is determined by the pollicott - ruelle resonances but no direct evidence has been reported . here",

    "the continuous time evolution of the wavefunction for graphs is obtained from the propagator which is obtained from the fourier transform of the green function on the graph .",

    "the pollicott - ruelle resonances are of special importance because their quantum manifestation has been found in experimental measures of some correlation functions in microwave scattering @xcite .    apart from the aforementioned time - dependent quantities we have also studied spectral quantities like the quantum scattering resonances .",

    "the distribution of their imaginary part has been conjectured to be related to the diffusion process observed for the classical system @xcite .",

    "we have studied dynamical and spectral properties of open quantum graphs with emphasis in their relation to the transport properties of the corresponding classical dynamics .",
    "the classical dynamics has been obtained as the classical limit of the quantum dynamics .",
    "the time evolution of the quantum system is obtained from the propagator which is computed as the fourier transform of the green function .",
    "a closed expression and a multi - scattering representation for the green function has been presented .",
    "we want to emphasize that both , classical and quantum evolution are considered with the continuous time in opposition to the discrete time evolution often considered in the literature of lattice networks .    in particular ,",
    "we have computed the quantum staying probability . for short times , this quantity decay exponentially in time with the classical escape rate .",
    "this classical escape rate is obtained from the classical zeta function and correspond to the leading pollicott - ruelle resonance . for large open periodic graphs",
    "the leading pollicott - ruelle resonance determines a decay dominated by diffusion and the decay of the quantum staying probability reveals at the quantum level the emerging diffusion process .    on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum spectral properties are also related to transport .",
    "the resonance spectrum reveals some features related to both , the ballistic propagation in the periodic system for the long time evolution and the diffusive classical dynamics that is an approximation for the quantum dynamics for times shorter than the heisenberg times .",
    "indeed , the fourier transform relates the long - time behavior to the variations at small energy scales . at small scales ,",
    "the resonance spectrum is arranged in bands of @xmath466 resonances that converges as @xmath467 towards the real axis .",
    "therefore the lifetime of each resonance in a band is proportional to the size of the system reflecting the ballistic transport that characterize periodic system as state the bloch theorem @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this ballistic propagation affects the long - time dynamics .",
    "indeed , the bloch theorem gives information about stationary states .",
    "the short time dynamics is determined by the large fluctuations of the resonance spectrum . at a large scale ,",
    "the resonance spectrum is uniform over the @xmath390 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.res12 ] ) .",
    "this distribution display a power law @xmath398 early obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and conjectured to be a general law for open quantum systems with diffusive classical limit .",
    "our numerical results support this conjecture for multiconnected spatially extended graphs .",
    "moreover , we have presented an alternative derivation of the density of resonances obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is based on general properties of the secular equations , namely , that is an almost - periodic function which in the appropriate limit its mean motion is in the lagrangian case .",
    "this method allows us to obtain an approximate lower bound for the distribution of @xmath468 .",
    "moroever , an upper bound for this distribution has been obtained from the topological pressure @xmath308 .",
    "this bound creates a gap in the resonance spectrum under the condition @xmath505 and is absent otherwise .    in summary",
    ", we have studied quantum properties of extended open periodic graphs .",
    "we have shown that the pollicott - ruelle resonances determine the decay of the quantum staying probability , which in turn shows the appearance of diffusion at the quantum level .",
    "the diffusion process is thus encoded in the distribution of scattering resonances .",
