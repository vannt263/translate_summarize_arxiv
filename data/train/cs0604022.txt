    "in this paper , we explore the motion - planning problem of _ reconfiguring _ or _ folding _ a hinged collection of rigid objects from one state to another while avoiding self - intersection .",
    "this general problem has been studied since the beginnings of the motion - planning literature when reif @xcite proved that deciding reconfigurability of a `` tree '' of polyhedra , amidst fixed polyhedral obstacles , is pspace - hard .",
    "this result has been strengthened in various directions over the years , although the cleanest versions were obtained only very recently : deciding reconfigurability of a tree of line segments in the plane , and deciding reconfigurability of a chain of line segments in 3d , are both pspace - complete @xcite .",
    "this result is tight in the sense that deciding reconfigurability of a chain of line segments in the plane is easy , in fact , trivial : the answer is always yes @xcite .",
    "these results illustrate a rather fine line in reconfiguration problems between computationally difficult and computationally trivial .",
    "the goal of our work is to characterize what families of planar shapes and hingings lead to the latter outcome , a _ universality result _ that reconfiguration is always possible .",
    "the only known example of such a result , however , is the family of chains of line segments , and that problem was unsolved for about 25 years @xcite .",
    "( a _ chain _ is a sequence of line segments joined end - to - end that are disjoint except except for consecutive endpoints , where they are hinged .",
    "it is called an _",
    "open chain _ when the first line segment is not joined to the last , and _ closed _ when it is joined to the last segment in a closed cycle . ) even small perturbations to the problem , such as allowing a single point where three line segments join , leads to _ locked _",
    "examples where reconfiguration is impossible @xcite .    what about chains of shapes other than line segments ?",
    "it is easy to see that a shape tucked into a `` pocket '' of a nonconvex shape immediately makes trivial locked chains with two pieces . back in january  1998",
    ", the third author showed how to simulate this behavior with convex shapes , indeed , just three triangles ; see figure [ locked 3 triangles ] . this example has circulated throughout the years to many researchers ( including the authors of this paper ) who have asked about chains of 2d shapes .",
    "the only really unsatisfying feature of the example is that some of the angles are very obtuse . but with a little more work , one can find examples with acute angles , indeed , equilateral triangles , albeit of different size ; see figure [ locked unequal equilateral ] . what could be better than equilateral triangles",
    "?    it is therefore reasonable to expect , as we did for many years , that there is no interesting class of shapes , other than line segments , with a universality result ",
    "essentially all other shapes admit locked chains .",
    "we show in this paper , however , that this guess is wrong .",
    "we introduce a family of shapes , called _ slender adornments _ , and prove that all open chains , made up of arbitrarily many different shapes from this family , can be universally reconfigured between any two states .",
    "indeed , we show that these chains have a natural canonical configuration , analogs of the straight configuration of an open chain .",
    "our result is based on the existence of `` expansive motions '' , proved in @xcite .",
    "our techniques build on the theory of unfolding chains of line segments , substantially generalizing and extending the results from that theory .",
    "indeed , the results in this paper essentially piggy - back onto the results of @xcite or any of the other results and algorithms such as @xcite that provide a continuous expansive motion of the base chain .",
    "our results go far beyond what _ we _ thought was possible ( until recently ) . as part of the methods that we describe here , we also consider discrete expansive motions of the base chain , that do not necessarily come from a continuous expansive motion .",
    "( a _ discrete expansion _ of a chain @xmath1 is simply another corresponding chain @xmath2 such that if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are two points in @xmath1 the distance between corresponding points @xmath5 and @xmath6 is not smaller than the distance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ) in that case if all the slender adornments are _ symmetric _ under the reflection about the line of the base chain , then any expansive discrete motion of the base chain will have the property that the attached adornments will not overlap .",
    "it turns out that the continuous case , when the adornments are not necessarily symmetric , follows from the discrete symmetric case .",
    "the family of slender adornments has several equivalent definitions .",
    "the key idea is to distinguish the two hinge points on the boundary of the shape connecting to the adjacent shapes in the chain , and view the shape as an _ adornment _ to the line segment connecting those two hinges , called the _",
    "base_. this view is without loss of generality , but provides additional information relating the shapes and how they are attached to neighbors , which turns out to be crucial to obtaining a universality result .",
    "an adornment is _ slender _ if the distance from either endpoint of the base to a point moving along one side of the adornment changes monotonically . if the boundary curve , defining the adornment , is sufficiently smooth , it is slender if and only if every inward normal of the shape hits the base .",
    "equivalently , an adornment is slender if it is the union , in each half - plane having the base as a boundary , of the intersection of pairs of disks centered at the two endpoints of the base .",
    "for the first and last edge of an open chain , there may be some freedom in defining the base .",
    "slender adornments are quite general .",
    "figure [ slender ] shows several examples of slender adornments .",
    "these examples are themselves slender adornments , but also any pair can be joined along their bases so that the union makes another slender adornment .",
    "our results imply that one can take any of these slender adornments , link the bases together into an open chain in any way that the chain does not self - intersect , and the resulting chain can be unfolded without self - intersection to a straight configuration , and thus the chain can be folded without self - intersection into every configuration .",
    "we also demonstrate the tightness of the family of slender adornments by giving examples of locked chains of shapes that are not slender .",
    "specifically , we show that , for any desired angle @xmath7 , there is a locked chain of isosceles triangles with apex angle  @xmath8 .",
    "this is precisely the family of isosceles - triangle adornments that are not slender .",
    "thus , for chains of triangles , obtuseness is really desirable , contrary to our intuition from figure  [ locked 3 triangles ] : the key is that the apex angle opposite the base ( in the adornment view ) be nonacute , not any other angle .",
    "the proof that our examples are locked uses the self - touching theory developed for trees of line segments in @xcite .",
    "[ [ motivation . ] ] motivation .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + +    hinged collections of rigid objects have been studied previously in many contexts , particularly robotics .",
    "one recent body of algorithmic work by cheong et al .",
    "@xcite considers how chains of polygonal objects can be _ immobilized _ or _ grasped _ by a robot with a limited number of actuators .",
    "grasping is a natural first step toward robotic _ manipulation _ , but the latter challenge requires a better understanding of reconfigurability .",
    "this paper offers the first theoretical underpinnings for reconfiguration of chains of rigid objects ( other than line segments ) .",
    "another potential application is to continuous folding of hinged dissections .",
    "hinged dissections are chains or trees of polygons that can be reconfigured into two or more self - touching configurations with desired silhouettes .",
    "for example , figure  [ dudeney ] shows a classic hinged dissection from 1902 of a square into an equilateral triangle of the same area .",
    "many general families of hinged dissections have been established in the recent literature @xcite .",
    "one problem not addressed in this literature , however , is whether the reconfigurations can actually be executed without self - intersection , as in figure  [ dudeney ] .",
    "our results provide potential tools , previously lacking , for addressing this problem .",

    "section [ slender adornments ] defines the model and slender adornments more precisely , and proves several basic properties .",
    "section [ symmetric adornments ] describes the case when each adornment is symmetric about its base and is important for proving , in section [ slender adornments can not lock ] , that simple chains of slender adornments can always be unfolded so that the base is convex or straight . in section [ generalizations ]",
    "we discuss the situation when the adornments are permitted to overlap .",
    "section [ locked sharp ] describes our examples of locked chains of isosceles triangles , including the necessary background from self - touching trees .",
    "the conclusion ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) includes several closing remarks .",
    "the results of this paper have been reviewed and sketched in the survey  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  4 ) , which cites this paper ( in its full form ) as the source of the results and the proofs .",
    "this section provides a formal statement of the objects we consider  adorned chains consisting of slender adornments  and proves several basic results about them .",
    "our object of study is a chain of nonoverlapping rigid planar shapes ( jordan regions ) that are hinged together sequentially at rotatable joints .",
    "another way to view such a chain is to consider the _ underlying polygonal chain _ , the _ core _ , of line segments connecting successive joints .",
    "( for an open chain , there is some freedom in choosing the endpoints for the first and the last bar of the chain . ) on the one hand , these line segments can be viewed as _",
    "bars _ that move rigidly with the shapes to which they belong . on the other hand",
    ", the shapes can be viewed as `` adornments '' to the bars of an underlying polygonal chain .",
    "this view leads to the concept of an `` adorned polygonal chain '' , which we now proceed to define more precisely .",
    "an _ adornment _ is a simply connected compact region in the plane , called the _",
    "shape _ , together with a line segment @xmath9 connecting two boundary points , called the _",
    "base_. there are two _ boundary arcs _ from @xmath3 to @xmath4 that enclose the shape , called",
    "_ sides_. we require the base to be contained in the shape ; i.e. , the base must be a chord of the shape .",
    "we say that two distinct adornments _ overlap _ when some point of one adornment lies in the interior of the other , and we insist that the relative interiors of the base chains be disjoint .",
    "thus , the bases of two shapes are not allowed to touch except at common hinges of the polygonal chain .",
    "adorned polygonal chain _ is a set of nonoverlapping adornments whose bases form a polygonal chain .",
    "we permit the shapes to touch on their boundary and to slide along each other .    for our main result , theorem [ thm : main ] , where we assume that the motion of the base is expansive , it is not necessary to assume that the base chain is simple .",
    "it can be any finite embedded graph with straight edges whose relative interiors are pairwise disjoint ; a vertex may touch an edge . when the base chain is simple the results of @xcite or @xcite guarantee that there is such an expansive motion . on the the other hand , although an expansive motion of the base chain of a strictly simple closed polygon to a convex convex configuration can be guaranteed , it may happen that two realizations are not in the same configuration component , as shown in figure [ fig:2-components ] , and in the conclusion ( section  [ sec : conclusion ] ) there is a description of a case when there are infinitely many components in the configuration space .",
    "the viewpoint of a chain of shapes as an adorned polygonal chain is useful for two reasons .",
    "first , we can more easily talk about the kinds of shapes , and their relation to the locations of the incident hinges , in a family of chains : this information is captured by the adornments .",
    "second , the underlying polygonal chain provides a mechanism for folding the chain of shapes , as well as a natural _ unfolding _ goal : straighten the underlying open chain or convexify the underlying closed chain .",
    "indeed , we show that , in some cases , unfolding motions of the polygonal chain induce valid unfolding motions of the chain of shapes .",
    "an adornment is defined to be _ slender _ if , for a point moving on either side of the shape , the distance to each endpoint of the base changes monotonically ( possibly not strictly monotonically ) .",
    "an adornment is called _ symmetric _ if it is symmetric about the line through the base .",
    "an adornment is called _ one - sided _ if it lies in just one of the closed half - planes whose boundary contains the base . clearly , a general adornment is the union of two one - sided adornments , and a one - sided adornment is the intersection of a symmetric adornment with a closed half - plane whose boundary contains the base . for a base segment @xmath10 $ ] and a point @xmath11 in the plane , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 , let @xmath14 be the intersection of the two disks with @xmath11 on its boundary , centered at @xmath3 and at @xmath4 .",

    "similarly , no point along the path from @xmath11 to @xmath3 intersects the interior of the circle centered at @xmath4 through @xmath11 .",

    "any slender adornment must be contained in the disk through the other end of the base , and thus it is in the intersection of those two disks .",

    "thus there is an equilibrium assignment to these stresses , unique up to scaling , and the stresses all have the same sign . because zero - length connections must be negative , we are forced to make all three of these stresses negative .",
    "we also choose this scale factor to be substantially smaller than the stresses that have been assigned so far .    by assigning @xmath120",

    "therefore @xmath124 and @xmath125 can be assigned negative stresses .",
    "finally , vertex @xmath2 is also in equilibrium because @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and the stress from the zero - length connections are the same as for @xmath1 but in the opposite direction .    in summary",
    ", we have shown the existence of a stress that is positive on all zero - length connections . by lemma  [ stress lemma ] ,",
    "the self - touching configuration is infinitesimally rigid , so by lemma  [ rigid rigid ] , the configuration is rigid . by the simplification arguments above , the original self - touching configuration is also rigid . by theorem  [ strong lock ] , the original self - touching configuration is strongly locked , so sufficiently perturbations are locked .",
    "we remark that an argument similar to the one above , using an assignment of stresses , can also be used for proving rules  [ rule 1 ] and  [ rule 2 ] , with an appropriate modification of lemma  [ stress lemma ] ; however , the direct argument that we have given is simpler .",
    "the argument relied on the isosceles triangles having an apex angle of @xmath0 ( but no more ) in order to guarantee that particular triples of stress directions are or are not in a halfplane .",
    "it also relies on the symmetry of the configuration through a vertical line ( excluding the triangle in the upper right ) .",
    "thus the argument generalizes to all isosceles triangles sharper than  @xmath64 .",
    "figure  [ locked 7 equilateral ] shows another , simpler example of a locked chain of equilateral triangles , using just seven triangles instead of nine .",

    ", the resulting simplified configuration is not infinitesimally rigid ( the middle vertex can move infinitesimally horizontally ) , so we can not use a stress argument . in this case , however , we can use a more direct argument to prove rigidity of the simplified configuration ( and thus of the original self - touching configuration ) .",

    "the left chain of two bars forces the distance between @xmath17 and @xmath41 to be at most @xmath129 , with equality as in the original configuration only if the angle between the two bars remains straight .",
    "the right chain of three bars can only open its angles , because of the three triangles on the inside , so the right chain acts as a _ cauchy arm_. the cauchy - steinitz arm lemma ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) proves that the endpoints of such a chain can only get farther away from each other .",
    "thus the distance between @xmath17 and @xmath41 is at least @xmath129 , with equality only if the angles in the right chain do not change .",
    "these upper and lower bounds of @xmath129 on the distance between @xmath17 and @xmath41 force the bounds to hold with equality , which prevents any angles from changing except possibly for the angles at @xmath17 and  @xmath41 .",

    "@xcite have utilized our results in proving that hinged dissections exist .",

    "our results have application to hinged dissections of polyregulars , e.g. , polyominoes ; this includes the ( slender ) case of squares connected at opposite corners .",
    "an interesting question arising in this context is whether every hinged dissection can be subdivided so that the pieces are slender .",
    "we note that there are examples of open and closed chains of self - touching squares ( some of which are attached at adjacent corners ) that we conjecture to be locked ( figure  [ fig : locked - squares ] ) ; while we have been unable so far to prove that they are , the methods we employed for the locked chains of sharp triangles ( section  [ locked sharp ] ) may be applicable .",
    "one difficulty of exploring the space of adorned chains is highlighted by the following construction .",
    "it consists of a closed chain , a convex parallelogram , with slender adornments attached , where each adornment together with its base is convex , such that the configuration space has infinitely many components .",
    "we attach a single obtuse triangle as a slender adornment to the top base segment , as with figure [ fig:2-components ] .",
    "if the bottom segment is fixed the path of the bottom vertex in the upper adornment traces out a circle , which is shown as a dashed circular arc @xmath1 in figure [ fig : inf - comp](a ) .",
    "the second slender adornment is attached to the bottom segment and is the convex hull of infinitely many points , each slightly above @xmath1 .",
    "the points form an infinite sequence @xmath130 converging to a point on the right @xmath131 , and they are chosen so the straight line interval from @xmath58 to @xmath132 intersects the lower portion of @xmath1 ( the open circular disk determined by @xmath1 ) .",
