    "* ) have detected many new cepheid variables through their photometric signatures , resulting in a valuable expansion of the galactic cepheid sample @xcite once confirmed by spectroscopic observation . in the case of gsc 03729 - 01127 ( tassiv 6349369 ) , a suspected cepheid studied here , the variable may be an open cluster member and a potentially valuable calibrator for the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation .",
    "cepheids continue to provide the foundation for the universal distance scale , and such variables could serve as an efficient means of quantifying the extinction to galactic and extragalactic targets .    the results of the seminal hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project yielded a hubble constant of @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 @xcite , a value supported by cosmological constraints inferred from wmap observations @xcite .",
    "the hst results are tied to large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) cepheids , which advantageously provide a large sample of common distance",
    ". however , distance estimates for the lmc exhibit an unsatisfactorly large scatter @xcite , resulting in an uncertain zero - point .",
    "moreover there exists a difference in metallicity between lmc cepheid variables relative to both galactic cepheids and those in galaxies used for calibrating secondary distance candles , the effects of which remain actively debated .",
    "@xcite , for example , suggest that the lmc cepheid pl relation appears to characterize short - period cepheids as too bright relative to their galactic counterparts , and long - period cepheids as too faint .",
    "conversely , @xcite and @xcite suggest , on the basis of revised hipparcos and newly - derived hst parallaxes , that the slopes of the pl relations ( @xmath3 ) for cepheids in the galaxy and the lmc are consistent to within their cited uncertainties .",
    "indeed , the results presented in section [ extragal ] , complementing in part those of @xcite , appear to confirm ideas put forth in each of the above studies , namely that the slope of the pl relation is not universal in certain passbands , and for _ vj _ and _ vi _ constructed relations , any putative difference in slope arising from metallicity effects appears negligible in comparison with other concerns and uncertainties related to extragalactic observations .",
    "nevertheless , a consensus has yet to emerge and a resolution to the above debate may be assisted by renewed efforts towards establishing galactic cepheids as cluster members , a connection that provides direct constraints on cepheid luminosities , intrinsic colours , masses , metallicities , and pulsation modes .",
    "@xcite compiled an extensive list of suspected cluster cepheids based upon preliminary analyses , but only a few cluster / cepheid pairs have been studied with the necessary detail to determine the parameters of the associated clusters accurately , or to obtain the necessary radial velocity measures needed to establish membership in cases where reliable proper motions are unavailable . efforts to discover new galactic open clusters @xcite and cepheid variables @xcite have resulted in a welcome increase to the number of suspected cluster cepheids .",

    "the distance to a cepheid can be established through adoption of intrinsic parameters from published pl ( @xmath10 versus @xmath11 ) and period - colour [ @xmath12 versus @xmath11 ] relations , although such estimates typically idealize the result to an object located near the centre of the instability strip .",
    "neglect of the intrinsic scatter inherent to such relationships can affect estimates of colour excess and distance to individual cepheids made from them , since the variable may lie anywhere within the strip ( e.g. , towards the red or blue edge ) .",
    "large calibrating data sets are therefore required when constructing strict two - parameter cepheid relations to ensure a reasonably even sampling of both sides of the strip and to avoid a least - squares solution biased towards predominantly red or blue edge objects , an important consideration that is often overlooked .",

    "the standard period - luminosity - colour ( plc ) relation for cepheids can be expressed as : @xmath17 equation ( [ eqn1 ] ) can therefore be rewritten as : @xmath18 or : @xmath19 a calibrating set ( table 1 ) consisting of established cluster cepheids and cepheids with parallaxes measured recently with the hst @xcite was used to determine the co - efficients in equation ( [ eqn2 ] ) that minimize the @xmath4 statistic , yielding an optimum solution given by : @xmath20 the resulting relationship reproduces the distances and colour excesses for the calibrating set with formal average uncertainties of @xmath21% ( fig .",
    "[ linearrel ] ) .",
    "the true scatter applying to use of the relationship for individual cepheids may be larger , given that the calibrating set consists primarily of large - amplitude cepheids lying near the centre of the instability strip .",
    "the colour excess term can also be characterized in terms of observable parameters as : @xmath22 where ( _ v  j _ ) colour appears to be a viable surrogate for determining colour excess , although _ h_- or _",
    "k_-band photometry could be substituted for _",
    "j_. a test of the colour excess relation using ( _ v  h _ ) and ( _ v  k _ ) produced slightly larger @xmath4 statistics than when ( _ v  j _ ) was used as the colour index , so the latter was adopted in the present study .",
    "suitable infrared and optical photometry for the calibrating cepheids ( table [ calset ] ) was obtained from @xcite , @xcite and sources identified by @xcite ( see discussion in their section 2.1 ) , with _",
    "j_-band measures being standardized on the 2mass system .",
    "the co - efficients of equation ( [ eqn3 ] ) that minimize the @xmath4 statistic are : @xmath23 the co - efficients of the same equation that minimize the @xmath4 statistic for ( _ v  h _ ) and ( _ v  k _ ) are : @xmath24 and @xmath25    equation ( [ eqn4 ] ) reproduces the reddenings for the calibrating cepheids with an average uncertainty of @xmath26 mag .",
    "[ linearrel ] ) , although the true scatter applying to use of the relationship for individual cepheids will be larger .",
    "the relation makes use of _ v _ and _ j_-band photometry ( 2mass ) that are widely available , and should provide a first order estimate in the absence of reddenings determined by means of @xmath27 photometry @xcite , spectroscopic analyses @xcite , or space reddenings @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a reddening - free distance relation analagous to the wesenheit function @xcite can be constructed by setting @xmath28 [ equation ( [ eqn3 ] ) ] , which results in a negligible increase in the @xmath4 statistic relative to the optimum solution in equation ( [ eqn3 ] ) .",
    "a reanalysis of the co - efficients then yields : @xmath29     with literature values.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   with literature values.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    published results raise questions about the pulsation modes of the s - cepheids ev sct and qz nor @xcite . with the relationship derived here",

    "otherwise , equation ( [ eqn3 ] ) with the assumption of fundamental mode pulsation results in anomalous luminosities for the cepheids , namely values that differ from those resulting from implied cluster membership by several times the mean uncertainties .",
    "such conclusions are sensitive , however , to the distances adopted for both clusters in table [ calset ] .",
    "reliable estimates for a cepheid s colour excess from equation ( [ eqn4 ] ) require the availability of precise mean _",
    "j_-band magnitudes .",
    "infrared light curves are readily available for the calibrating set ( table [ calset ] ) , but in most instances only single epoch 2mass photometry exists .",
    "the derivation of mean magnitudes from single epoch observations is complicated by several issues .",
    "first , cepheids undergo rapid period changes @xcite , so a significant time lapse between single epoch observations and those of the reference optical light curve can result in correspondingly large phase offsets . on the other hand ,",
    "most cepheids with periods between 5 and 10 days exhibit relatively slow period changes , as confirmed observationally in section [ cepheids ] .",
    "second , the mean magnitude deduced from single epoch observations is less certain because the morphological structure of the light curve can change between the optical and infrared ( e.g. , sv vul ) ; the former traces the temperature , and the latter the radius .",
    "deriving colour excesses for stars lacking multiple observations is undoubtedly less precise , especially for large amplitude cepheids and those exhibiting a significant , yet usually unknown , period change .    the mean _",
    "j_-magnitude @xmath31 can be approximated by : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the magnitude for the single epoch observation , @xmath34 is the visual magnitude at the same phase as @xmath33 , @xmath35 is the _",
    "v_-band magnitude of the star at maximum brightness , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the light amplitudes of the cepheid in the visual and _ j_-band , respectively .",
    "for the _ v _ to _ j _ amplitude relation outlined by @xcite and @xcite of @xmath38 , the equation becomes : @xmath39    a derivation of the mean magnitude for the cluster cepheids dl cas , cv mon , qz nor , v340 nor , and ev sct , which are not saturated in the 2mass survey and have been observed at a fairly recent epoch by asas , thereby minimizing the effects of period changes , yields an average difference of @xmath26 mag .",
    "relative to mean _ j_-band mangitudes found in the literature .",
    "that may be an optimistic estimate given that the light curves for cepheids in the above sample are primarily sinusoidal and of small amplitude . in spite of the cited uncertainties for single epoch 2mass observations ( @xmath40 mag . ) and the above considerations , equation ( [ eqn5 ] ) proves to be a satisfactory approximation for determining @xmath31 .",
    "the distance to the lmc and smc can be established by adopting the reddening - free relations highlighted earlier and utilizing _ v _ and _ i _ photometry from ogle @xcite , _ v _ and _ j _ photometry from a combined set of ogle and 2mass data compiled by the authors ( see fig .",
    "[ lmc ] ) , and _",

    "the distance moduli to the smc derived from _",
    "vi _ and _ vj _ photometry are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the diagrams constructed from reddening - free _ vi _ and _ vj _ relations remain generally unbiased towards redder colours , but there is an obvious bias for the _ bv _ distances that may be attributed to line blanketing effects arising from metallicity differences among milky way , lmc and smc cepheids .",
    "the effect is more pronounced for the smc , an expected trend given that smc cepheids exhibit a lower metallicity than those of the lmc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the results confirm that the slope of the pl relation is not universal when based on _ bv _ photometry , while by comparison , the slopes for the _ vj _ and _ vi _ relations seem relatively unaffected by metallicity .",
    "the derived distances are consistent with values found in the literature ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) , although distances cited in other studies are preferred since a putative zero - point metallicity correction was not addressed here .",
    "result establishes the viabilitiy of 2mass photometry in such analyses in spite of the survey s single epoch observations .",
    "indeed , the uncertainty in the _ vj _ result could be reduced by approximating the mean @xmath31-band magnitude according to the prescription described earlier or that described by @xcite .",
    "lastly , it is noted that biases towards redder colours may also result from standardization problems ( see figure 14 of * ? ? ?",
    "the giant elliptical galaxy ngc 5128 hosts large numbers of cepheids , and @xcite derived a distance of @xmath45 mpc to the galaxy using the wesenheit pl calibration ( see table 6 and section 5.3 in their paper ) . the distance to ngc 5128 established with the reddening - free _ vi _ relation formulated in section [ framework ] is @xmath46 mpc .",
    "star c43 in table 5 of @xcite is presumably not a type i cepheid .",
    "similarly , @xcite derived a distance of @xmath47 mpc to ngc 2090 from cepheids , while the reddening - free _ vi _ relation given here yields a comparable distance of @xmath48 mpc . a broader analysis including a larger sample of galaxies is needed to draw any meaningful conclusions , but to first order the results are in agreement .",

    "<S> fourier analysis of the photometry for bd cas and recent estimates of its metallicity constrain it to be a population i overtone pulsator rather than a type ii s - cepheid . </S>",
    "<S> ab cam and bd cas are not physically associated with the spatially - adjacent open clusters tombaugh 5 and king 13 , respectively , the latter being much older ( @xmath0 ) than believed previously . </S>",
    "<S> rates of period change are determined for the three cepheids from archival and published data . </S>",
    "<S> gsc 03729 - 01127 and ab cam exhibit period increases , implying fifth and third crossings of the instability strip , respectively , while bd cas exhibits a period decrease , indicating a second crossing , with possible superposed trends unrelated to binarity . </S>",
