    "in @xcite , an integral representation for the propagator of the massive dirac equation in the non - extreme kerr geometry outside the event horizon is derived in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "this integral representation has been used to study the long - time behavior including decay rates as well as the probability that the dirac particle escapes to infinity  @xcite .",
    "the shortcoming of this integral representation is that it gives a solution of the cauchy problem only outside the event horizon . in the present paper , an integral representation",
    "is constructed which completely describes the dynamics of dirac waves outside , across , and inside the event horizon , up to the cauchy horizon .",
    "the methods for deriving our integral representation are quite different from those used in  @xcite , as is now outlined .",
    "we work with horizon - penetrating advanced eddington - finkelstein - type coordinates  @xmath0  @xcite , i.e. , an analytic extension of boyer - lindquist coordinates which covers both the exterior and interior black hole regions without exhibiting poles at the horizons and which has a proper coordinate time  @xmath1 as needed for the formulation of the cauchy problem .",
    "moreover , we work with a regular carter tetrad , that is , a symmetric newman - penrose null tetrad frame which makes use of , on the one hand , the discrete time and angle reversal isometries of kerr geometry and , on the other hand , its petrov type . after computing the corresponding spin coefficients ,",
    "the massive dirac equation is given in hamiltonian form @xmath2 we introduce a scalar product on the solution space and show explicitly that the dirac hamiltonian is symmetric with respect to this scalar product ( on smooth and compactly supported wave functions ) . furthermore , it is established that this scalar product coincides with the canonical scalar product obtained by integrating the normal component of the dirac current .",
    "we point out that in this setting , the dirac equation and the scalar product are smooth at the horizons .    in order to apply the spectral theorem , we need to construct a self - adjoint extension of the dirac hamiltonian . first , to have a unitary time evolution , we must prevent that the dirac wave `` hits '' the curvature singularity . to this end , we `` shield '' the singularity by imposing _ dirichlet - type boundary conditions _ on a time - like surface inside the cauchy horizon . clearly , these boundary conditions change the dynamics of the dirac wave because the wave is reflected on the boundary surface .",
    "however , the dynamics _ outside the cauchy horizon _ is not affected ( because the reflected wave can not cross the cauchy horizon and reenter the region outside the cauchy horizon ; see fig .  1 on page  ) .",
    "since the dirac hamiltonian is not elliptic at the horizons , we employ a general method for non - uniformly elliptic boundary value problems introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this gives a self - adjoint extension , making it possible to solve the cauchy problem by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spectral measure of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the initial data . by means of stone s formula , we can represent the spectral measure via the resolvent @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the final step is to express the resolvent in terms of the solutions of the odes obtained from chandrasekhar s separation of variables .",
    "employing this separation ansatz in   and using the angular odes , the dirac hamiltonian becomes a first - order ordinary differential operator in the radial variable .",
    "the resolvent of this operator can be described in terms of the green s matrix of the radial odes . performing the sum over all angular momentum modes yields the resolvent in separated form .",

    ", \\textnormal{d}\\omega \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the azimuthal mode and @xmath11 labels the eigenvalues of the angular operator ( for details see theorem  [ prop ] ) .",
    "because the system of radial odes can not be solved analytically without making suitable approximations or by considering asymptotics , here , the asymptotic radial solutions at infinity and at the event and cauchy horizons are used for guidance in the implicit construction of the radial solutions needed for the computation of the green s matrix .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii states the settings for kerr geometry and for the dirac equation . moreover , required results from the asymptotic and spectral analysis are recalled without giving proofs .",
    "section iii contains the hamiltonian formulation of the dirac equation in kerr geometry in horizon - penetrating coordinates and a derivation of a suitable scalar product for the hilbert space of solutions of the cauchy problem .",
    "also , the symmetry of the dirac hamiltonian with respect to this scalar product is proven explicitly . in section iv",
    ", it is shown that the dirac hamiltonian has an essentially self - adjoint extension .",
    "finally , the integral representation for the dirac propagator is constructed .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the relevant basics on the non - extreme kerr geometry in horizon - penetrating advanced eddington - finkelstein - type coordinates , the dirac equation in the newman - penrose formalism , chandrasekhar s separation of variables , and asymptotic and spectral results on solutions to the corresponding radial and angular first - order ode systems .",
