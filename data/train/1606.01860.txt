    "ligo has opened a new window into the universe by successfully launching the era of gravitational wave astronomy @xcite .",
    "the ligo detector is sensitive to gravitational waves with frequencies @xmath1  hz  @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest to probe the gravitational wave spectrum in the frequency band 0.1  hz - 10  hz @xcite .",
    "inspiralling black hole and neutron star binaries have to travel through this lower frequency band before entering ligo s band @xcite",
    ". continuous observation of these inspirals may allow better estimation of binary parameters , potentially enabling their use as standard sirens for cosmological measurements @xcite .",
    "further , extremal black holes observed well before their final coalescence can constrain the existence of ultra - light bosonic particles such as axions @xcite .",
    "in addition to sources that are observable at ligo , the mergers of intermediate mass black holes @xcite ( that do not make it to ligo s band ) occur in the frequency band 0.1 hz - 10 hz .",
    "this band is also expected to be relatively free of unresolvable astrophysical gravitational wave backgrounds , making it an optimal choice to search for cosmological sources of stochastic gravitational waves such as those expected from cosmic inflation @xcite .",
    "atom interferometers have the potential to probe this spectrum in terrestrial and satellite - based experiments @xcite .",
    "these proposals are motivated by recent , demonstrated advances in atom technology such as the ability to perform large momentum transfer beamsplitters @xcite to coherently separate atomic wave - packets by @xmath2 54 cm @xcite , delta kick cooling @xcite of atom ensembles to pk temperatures @xcite and the development of optical clock metrology @xcite .",
    "additionally , the original detector concept required two - photon transitions which introduce laser noise into the measurement ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . using single photon transitions was known to preserve the needed ` accelerometer ' signal and remove laser noise ( see e.g.  @xcite ) but is not sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this problem is solved by a new technique which allows large momentum transfer beamsplitters and hence a sensitive gravitational wave detector without laser noise @xcite .",
    "thus atom interferometry shows significant potential for gravitational wave detection .    in the detector scheme considered in this paper @xcite , two widely separated atom interferometers ( essentially optical clocks )",
    "are run using common lasers , where the lasers drive single - photon transitions in the atoms .",
    "each interferometer can be thought of as precisely comparing the time kept by the laser s clock ( the laser s phase ) , and the time kept by the atom s clock ( the atom s phase ) .",
    "a passing gravitational wave changes the normal flat space relation between these two clocks by a factor proportional to the distance between them .",
    "this change oscillates in time with the frequency of the gravitational wave .",
    "this is the signal that can be measured with an atom interferometer .",
    "the signal in an individual interferometer is masked by laser phase , frequency and platform noise .",
    "however , since the same laser beams are used to operate both interferometers , their differential phase contains the gravitational wave signal with severely suppressed laser noise .",
    "this differential signal enables the operation of gravitational wave detectors with a single baseline , as opposed to the two ( or more ) baselines demanded by conventional optical interferometers .",
    "in addition , this approach also exploits the fact that the atom ensembles are inherently mechanically isolated from the environment as they free - fall during the optical interrogation sequence @xcite .",
    "we note that instead of single - photon optical clock transitions , the interferometer can also be operated using conventional two - photon bragg / raman transitions wherein the atoms serve as a phase reference to the lasers used to drive the interferometers . in this case",
    ", since the lasers are the only available clock , cancellation of laser frequency noise requires the operation of two ( or more ) baselines @xcite or an additional optical frequency reference ( e.g. , an optical lattice clock @xcite and frequency comb @xcite ) .",
    "the resonant scheme developed in this paper can be applied both to the optical clock and two photon bragg / raman atom interferometer configurations .",
    "the conventional light - pulse atom interferometer configuration based on a @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath3 pulse sequence is maximally sensitive to gravitational waves whose frequency @xmath5 is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the interrogation time of the interferometer ( the time interval between successive pulses ) . when this condition is satisfied , the gravitational wave completes a full cycle in time @xmath8 , resulting in the maximum possible change of the baseline s proper length during the interferometer . for frequencies @xmath9 ,",
    "the wave oscillates many times during @xmath7 . since the arms of the interferometer remain fixed during these rapid oscillations , the effects of the wave largely cancels , except for phase shifts accrued over a single period @xmath10 of the wave .",
    "the instrument s mechanical design fixes the maximum interrogation time @xmath11 @xcite and sets the lowest frequency accessible to the detector . in this paper , we show that for frequencies @xmath12 , the pulse sequences used to drive the interferometer can be changed to _ resonantly _ enhance the sensitivity of the detector .",
    "hence , the same instrument can be switched in real time to operate in a more sensitive , resonant mode for frequencies @xmath12 , albeit at the expense of bandwidth .",
    "we show that this narrow band resonant mode enhances the sensitivity of the detector to both coherent signals ( such as inspiralling binaries ) and stochastic sources .",
    "the interferometer can be run in a resonant mode by using the pulse sequence @xmath13 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : many diamonds ] ) with @xmath14 @xmath4 pulses instead of the standard , broadband @xmath15 pulse sequence .",
    "the pulses are equally spaced in time by @xmath16 .",
    "gravitational waves with frequencies @xmath17 oscillate by half a cycle between the pulses ( e.g. , from crest to trough ) .",
    "unlike the broadband case , the phase differences caused by subsequent oscillations continually add in the resonant sequence , since the series of @xmath4 pulses periodically swap the arms of the interferometer .",
    "such pulse sequences have been previously explored in the context of optical clocks , where they have been used to characterize laser phase noise @xcite .",
    "they have also been recently proposed in the context of gravitational wave detection using optical lattice clocks @xcite .     and the other at position @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the baseline .",
    "the spacetime trajectories of the atoms are shown in blue for the ground state and red for the excited state .",
    "pulses of light ( thin black lines ) are sent back and forth from each end of the baseline and interact with the atoms ( interactions shown as black dots ) , transferring momentum to the atoms and changing their internal state . whether or not an interaction occurs is controlled by matching the frequency of the light pulses to the doppler shift of the atoms .",
    "the sequence shown consists of two single - photon transitions for each atom optic ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 momentum transferred ) and a resonant enhancement of @xmath23 ( three diamonds ) .",
    "the interrogation time @xmath7 depicted here is near the limit for this baseline @xmath24 , so the gaps between the sequential laser pulses are small . ]      as usual , we consider a configuration consisting of two atom interferometers separated by a baseline of length @xmath20 that are driven by a sequence of common laser pulses . in the following",
    "we assume the interferometers are based on single - photon transitions , although as mentioned above a resonant sequence can similarly be implemented using conventional two - photon atom optics . to take advantage of large momentum transfer ( lmt ) phase enhancement , each atom optics",
    "` pulse ' may actually consist of @xmath25 closely spaced @xmath4-pulses which increase the separation of the interferometer arms ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lmtai ] ) .",
    "we use the following metric written in the tt gauge for a plane gravitational wave traveling the @xmath26-direction : @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the strain amplitude of the gravitational wave , @xmath5 is the frequency , and @xmath30 is the initial phase .",
    "for simplicity we assume the interferometers lie along the @xmath31-axis so that the detector is maximally aligned with the gw strain .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize this to arbitrary gravitational wave polarization and angle of incidence , as is treated in @xcite .    to calculate the detector response",
    ", we determine the phase shift of the resonant interferometer using the methods described in previous work @xcite .",
    "the phase shift can be expressed as the sum of three contributions : the propagation phase , laser phase , and separation phase .",
    "the laser phase cancels to first order in a single - photon gradiometer @xcite , and the separation phase contribution to the signal can be neglected since the wavepacket separation is small compared to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "thus the leading order signal comes from a difference in propagation phase between the two interferometers , which arises because the atoms on one end of the baseline spend a different amount of time in the excited state than atoms on the other end .",
    "figure  [ fig : lmtai ] shows an lmt interferometer sequence .",
    "the interferometer is divided into segments in the ground ( blue ) and excited ( red ) states .",

    "for such a measurement it is desirable to cross - correlate two detectors .",

    "any of these sensitivity curves can be realized by the same physical detector ( e.g. , with the same baseline , telescope , and laser design ) and the response of the detector can be rapidly changed among these by changing the pulse sequence in software . in fig .",

    "once again , since the operating frequency @xmath114 can be easily changed , the detector can be scanned sequentially across this band to study signals at all frequencies .",
    "the strain sensitivity also depends on the minimum resolvable phase shift in the interferometer . assuming technical sources of phase noise can be suppressed sufficiently well as a common - mode , the detector phase readout is ultimately limited by the quantum projection noise of the atoms .",

    "we simply describe the tool of resonant atom interferometry and several different possible uses .",
    "one consideration is that in certain configurations there may be a tradeoff between the resonant enhancement @xmath14 and the lmt enhancement @xmath25 since both require repeated atom - laser interactions .",
    "for example , there is a practical limit to the total number of atom - laser interactions that are possible before an order one fraction of the atoms are not coherently transferred .",
    "a benefit to using more lmt instead of more resonant enhancement is that while both increase the signal linearly , lmt leaves the detector broadband .",
    "this tradeoff is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : sensitivityconstraints ] .    on the other hand , it is possible that atom loss is not the limiting factor .",
    "for instance , one limit on lmt is the spatial size of the interferometer region , which can become large because of the wavepacket separation associated with lmt @xcite .",
    "using resonant enhancement while reducing lmt allows the interferometer region to remain smaller because the two halves of the atom separate at a smaller recoil velocity @xmath118 . in order to maintain a fixed target sensitivity without resonant enhancement ( @xmath119 ) ,",
    "the product @xmath120 must be kept constant by increasing @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in the case of the green sensitivity curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] , maintaining the same sensitivity at the target frequency with @xmath119 would require @xmath121 , resulting in a wavepacket separation of @xmath122 . by comparison , using a resonant sequence ( @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) leads to a wavepacket separation of only @xmath125 . this tradeoff could allow a higher sensitivity interferometer to fit inside a fixed region such as a satellite . for a satellite - based gravitational wave detector",
    ", this could be a significant advantage of using this resonant mode of operation .",
    "there are multiple possible uses for the resonant mode .",
    "an important example is detection of a stochastic background of gravitational waves such as arises from inflation or other cosmological sources .",
    "the stochastic strain sensitivity of the resonant detector is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stochastic sensitivity ] .",
    "the @xmath113 band may be a particularly promising band for detecting cosmological sources because it may have less  noise \" from astrophysical binaries @xcite .",
    "a satellite based detector may for example naturally allow a total interrogation time around 100 s , thus giving a broadband sensitivity down to @xmath126 hz .",
    "it would be useful in this case to use resonance and give up sensitivity at those low frequencies where it is not useful , to gain sensitivity around 1 hz .",
    "a resonant enhancement of @xmath127 would move the peak sensitivity to 1 hz and significantly boost the sensitivity to a cosmological signal .",
    "the resonant frequency can be changed by order one , thus allowing measurement of the shape of the spectrum for a stochastic signal , and for example possibly allowing measurement of the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum .",

    "another important use of resonance is for astrophysical signals such as inspiraling binaries . at",
    "the lower frequencies around 1 hz and below these binaries last a very long time and are thus rather monochromatic .",
    "if a binary is detected , for example in broadband mode , resonant mode can be used to focus on it , greatly increasing the snr in a much shorter time .",
    "this would allow significantly more information to be learned about the binary including parameters such as masses , distance , and in particular the direction to the binary .",
    "for both a satellite based detector and a terrestrial detector , the baseline will rotate ( either with the earth or the satellite s motion ) , periodically changing the projection of the signal onto the detector baseline .",
    "the direction of the source can be inferred by observing the resulting variation in signal amplitude , ideally at many points in time throughout the period of rotation of the detector .",
    "the high snr in resonant mode means that the source can be resolved with less averaging time , allowing a much more accurate measurement of the direction of the source than would be possible with a broadband detector .",
    "the resonant mode not only helps gain information after a source has been detected , it also improves the detectability of long - lived sources .",
    "the resonant frequency can be scanned over a broad bandwidth .",
    "for example , if one chooses to operate in this swept - resonance mode , the strain sensitivity to such an astrophysical source is improved roughly as @xmath140 .",
    "this is because the strain sensitivity on resonance is increased by @xmath14 , while the integration time spent in each particular frequency band is decreased by a factor @xmath141 but this only costs as the square root of time .",
    "thus the swept - resonance mode may have significant use for detecting astrophysical sources as well as for gaining information about them once they are detected .",
    "there are several practical constraints that determine the sensitivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] .",
    "first , as mentioned above , there is a trade - off between lmt atom optics and resonant enhancement that limits the useful range of the ideal scaling @xmath142 .",
    "in particular , due to imperfect transfer efficiency and other losses associated with the atom optics pulses , there is in practice a maximum number of pulses @xmath143 that can be applied during a single interferometer .",
    "here we assume @xmath107 , which is an order of magnitude above the current state - of - the - art for a discrete pulse lmt sequence@xcite .",
    "for the resonantly enhanced lmt interferometer , the total number of pulses is @xmath144 , so keeping @xmath145 puts a constraint on the product of @xmath25 and @xmath14 that we respect in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] .",
    "another practical constraint is that the total interferometer duration must be less than the lifetime of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the maximum useful lifetime is limited by losses due to collisions with background gas atoms , scattering of stray light , the natural lifetime of the excited state , and expansion due to finite temperature . for a resonant interferometer with @xmath14 oscillations , the total time is constrained by @xmath146 .",
    "we assume a maximum time of @xmath108 .",
    "this can be reached with modest vacuum requirements ( @xmath147 ) and with atom ensemble temperatures of @xmath148 , similar to what has already been demonstrated using delta kick cooling @xcite .",
    "this constraint limits the resonant enhancement @xmath14 at low frequencies and is responsible for the stair - step shape of the sensitivity curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] .",
    "the @xmath143 and @xmath149 combined constraints explain the shape of the black sensitivity envelope in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] .",
    "respecting @xmath149 , higher frequencies allow for larger @xmath14 , but for a fixed @xmath143 the maximum allowed @xmath14 is smaller for higher values of @xmath25 . as a result , for each value of @xmath25 ( red , green , blue , and orange shaded regions ) the sensitivity improves at first going to higher frequencies , but at a certain point @xmath143 is reached and @xmath14 can no longer increase .",
    "this corresponds to the best sensitivity for that value of @xmath25 , and at frequencies above this the sensitivity begins to degrade in accordance with eq .",

    "while increasing @xmath25 improves the sensitivity scale factor , it reduces the maximum @xmath14 , so the net result is an increase in sensitivity at low frequency but a decrease at high frequency .",
    "increasing @xmath25 also limits the maximum allowed frequency , since the total duration of each lmt atom optic must be less than the interferometer time : @xmath150 .",
    "the upshot of these considerations is that different values of @xmath25 are preferable in different frequency ranges .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath25 and @xmath14 parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] are only optimized for one particular physical design and would be different for other baseline lengths and telescope diameters .      the sensitivity curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] is only an atom shot noise limited curve .",
    "it does not take into account all the other possible noise sources , since the level of those noise sources depends on other parameters of the detector .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to point out a new tool for gravitational wave detection .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the paper to create a full detector design . instead ,",
    "in this section we will discuss several of the most relevant noise sources and simply give the requirements on the experimental design that would allow those noise sources to be below the atom shot noise .",
    "we will not discuss how to implement such constraints in a realistic design .",
    "an important consideration for long baselines is the photon shot noise of the laser link @xcite .",
    "shot noise leads to uncertainty in the phase comparison between the incoming reference laser pulses and the local oscillator laser , and these phase errors accumulate for each pulse in the atom interferometer sequence . in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] we assume a @xmath105 telescope diameter and ensure that the accumulated photon shot noise is less than the atom shot noise @xmath104 at all frequencies shown .",
    "this constraint puts limits on @xmath14 that become relevant at high frequencies when the fact that @xmath151 would otherwise allow larger @xmath14 .",
    "using the analysis described in @xcite , the minimum required telescope diameter is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the power transmitted from one end of the laser link and @xmath154 is the repetition rate of the detector . as discussed in @xcite , multiple concurrent interferometers are needed to achieve the desired repetition rates . to eliminate dead time @xcite",
    ", atom cloud preparation and interferometer operation must be interleaved .    to alleviate photon shot noise constraints further at very long baselines",
    ", it can also be advantageous to trade - off the baseline length for lmt enhancement . to achieve a fixed target strain sensitivity at shorter baseline @xmath20",
    ", the effective light path length @xmath155 of the lmt pulse sequence can be held constant by increasing @xmath25 . in this way , the lmt sequences have the effect of folding a long baseline into a smaller physical separation , much like how the fabry - perot resonators in the arms of ligo give a longer effective baseline . by reducing the physical separation ,",
    "the light collection demands on the telescopes are reduced since the beams diverge less . at a fixed level of photon shot noise , the minimum required telescope diameter scales as @xmath156 @xcite , which is reduced as @xmath25 in increased .",
    "this scaling accounts for the fact that increasing @xmath25 has the unwanted side effect of increasing the total number of pulses , and thereby contributing additional photon shot noise to the detector .    the sensitivity curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] require tight constraints on the laser wavefront .",
    "laser wavefront aberrations @xmath157 couple to satellite transverse position noise @xmath158 as discussed in @xcite . since the phase errors from aberrations add coherently with each pulse , sequences with @xmath159 near @xmath143 are the most challenging .",
    "the wavefront requirement is @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the aberration wavelength .",
    "wavefront requirements may be traded against constraints on the satellite position noise @xmath158 .",
    "it may be possible to relax these requirements to some degree by imaging the atom ensemble and resolving the phase imprint of the aberrations .",
    "timing jitter in the heterodyne laser link can result in residual sensitivity to laser frequency noise @xcite .",
    "assuming the pulses can be synchronized to ensure time delays less than @xmath162 , the frequency noise amplitude spectral density of the interferometer laser must be @xcite @xmath163    kinematic noise such as from acceleration noise of the laser platform can couple to the detector if there is a non - zero relative velocity @xmath164 between the two interferometers @xcite . for a satellite - based detector ,",
    "relative velocity between the interferometers may arise because of perturbations to the orbits .",
    "the platform acceleration noise limit for the sensitivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain sensitivity ] is @xmath165 where @xmath166 is earth s gravity and @xmath167 is the target frequency of the detector .",
    "here we consider a relative velocity of @xmath168 , but the actual velocity perturbations depend strongly on the details of the orbit .",
    "although platform acceleration noise is magnified for sequences with many laser pulses , this is somewhat compensated by the fact that the acceleration requirement scales favorably with increasing frequency .",
    "the resonant mode enhances the capabilities of previously proposed gravitational wave detectors based on atomic sensors .",
    "the same instrument could be run either in broadband or resonant mode , and the switch can be made in real time since it only requires changing the laser pulse sequence .",
    "this mode is a new tool for these detectors that can provide design flexibility .",
    "for example , it can be used to accommodate constraints on the maximum size of the interferometer region , allowing a significantly more sensitive detector to fit in a confined region , such as inside a satellite .",
    "the sensitivity to astrophysical sources and the information gained about them can be enhanced with the resonant mode of operation .",
    "for instance , it may significantly boost the precision of the direction measurement .",
    "additionally , a specific binary may be followed in frequency until it reaches the ligo band above 10  hz , improving the confidence of the detection and the measurement of the binary s parameters by observing it in multiple frequency bands .",
    "the resonant mode may significantly enhance the use of these gravitational wave detectors for cosmology .",
    "a satellite - based detector operating in the resonant mode could have significantly enhanced sensitivity around 1 hz , which may be the optimal band to search for cosmological sources such as inflation .",
    "the only known ways to directly observe such signals from inflation are the cmb @xcite and direct gravitational wave detection in this frequency band .",
    "the 1 hz band probes a very different part of the inflationary epoch than the cmb , and a different part of the inflaton potential . in the ideal scenario ,",
    "a detection in both the cmb and a direct gw detector would provide a powerful test of the inflationary spectrum over roughly 18 orders of magnitude in frequency , probing details of the mechanism behind inflation .",
    "such a long lever - arm would allow precise measurement of inflationary parameters that may not otherwise be observable .",
    "gravitational waves offer possibly the only way to directly observe the universe before last scattering , potentially probing energy scales far above laboratory experiments .",
