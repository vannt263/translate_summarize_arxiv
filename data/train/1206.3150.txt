    "the machine has been upgraded to 1.5gev electron beam energy by a harmonic double - sided microtron  @xcite .",
    "this fourth stage , called mami - c , was completed in 2007 . with mami - c",
    "the threshold beam energy for associated strangeness production off protons was reached for the first time at mami .",
    "the electromagnetic production of kaons off the nucleon provides an important tool for understanding the dynamics of hyperon - nucleon systems .",
    "theoretically , the process is described often by effective lagrangian models , commonly referred to as `` isobar '' approach . in the isobaric models",
    "the reaction amplitudes are constructed from lowest - order ( so - called tree - level ) born terms with the addition of extended born terms for intermediate particles , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 resonances , exchanged in the @xmath4- , @xmath5- , and @xmath6-channels .",
    "a complete description of the reaction process would require all possible channels that could couple to the initial and final state .",
    "most of the model calculations for kaon electrophoto - production have been performed in the framework of tree - level isobar models  @xcite , however , few coupled - channels calculations exist  @xcite .",
    "the drawback of the isobaric models is the large and unknown number of exchanged hadrons that can contribute in the intermediate state of the reaction .",
    "depending on which set of resonances is included , very different conclusions about the strengths of the contributing diagrams for resonant baryon formation and kaon exchange may be reached .",
    "the kaon - maid and saclay - lyon models characterise our present understanding of kaon photoproduction reactions at photon energies below 1.5gev .",
    "the model sla is a simplified version of the full saclay - lyon model in which a nucleon resonance with spin-5@xmath72 appears in addition .",
    "the electro - production of strangeness introduces two additional contributions , that are vanishing for the kinematic point at @xmath8 0 : the longitudinal coupling of the photons in the initial state , and the electromagnetic and hadronic form factors of the exchanged particles . concerning the differential cross - section the model variations are strongest at small kaon centre - of - mass angle . to conclude",
    ", it is fair to say that new experimental data on strangeness production will challenge and improve our understanding of the strong interaction in the low energy regime of qcd .",

    "were performed since 2008 .",
    "positive kaons were detected in the  spectrometer in coincidence with the scattered electron into spectrometer  b. the central spectrometer angle of the kaon arm was 31.50@xmath13 with a large angular acceptance in the dispersive plane of @xmath14 2143@xmath13 .",
    "the spectrometer setting for electron detection was fixed at the minimum in - plane angle of @xmath15 15@xmath13 , thereby maximising the virtual photon flux .",
    "the invariant momentum transfer , @xmath16 , was very low , the virtual photon energy , @xmath17 , was near the maximum of the kaon photoproduction cross - section at 11.2gev , which excites a total energy in the virtual - photon - nucleon center - of - mass system , @xmath18 , of 1.61.7gev .",
    "the kinematic conditions are summarised in table  [ tab : kinematics ] .",
    "the cryogenic target in the spectrometer hall that was used for the kaon electro - production experiments consists of a 49.5 mm long target cell and is made of a 10@xmath9 m havar walls .",

    "measured time - of - flight and specific energy - loss spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tofdedx ] as a function of particle momentum .",
    "the time - of - flight was corrected for the path - length dispersion assuming the particle was a pion .",
    "the data sample is dominated by background particles ( p and @xmath19 ) because of a kaon - to - background ratio of 1:200 and the event sample was enriched in kaon events by a cut in missing mass to show the position of the band of kaons in relation to the two bands from the dominant particle species .",
    "the flight time difference between protons and kaons is 1015ns , between pions and kaons 510ns .",
    "the energy - loss separation between kaons and pions is small , whereas the separation between kaons and protons is of the order of 25mev@xmath20 cm .",
    "after electron and kaon identification the measured momenta , in magnitude and direction with respect to the incoming beam , allow for a full reconstruction of the missing energy and missing momentum of the recoiling system .",
    "the missing mass @xmath21 is related to the four - momentum @xmath22 of the virtual photon and the four - momentum @xmath23 of the detected kaon according to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the target four - momentum .",

    "the transformation between the differentials @xmath43 is incorporated into the virtual photon flux @xmath44 via the jacobian : @xmath45 the experimental yield can then be related to the cross - section by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the experimental luminosity that included global efficiencies such as dead - times and beam - current dependent corrections such as the tracking efficiency , @xmath48 is the acceptance function of the coincidence spectrometer set - up , and @xmath49 is the correction due to radiative or energy losses .    with a run - time of 244h",
    "using 2@xmath9a beam current ( at 14% dead - time ) and 38h using 4@xmath9a beam current ( at 45% dead - time ) the accumulated and corrected luminosity for the 2009 data - taking campaign was @xmath50 2300fbarn@xmath51 .",
    "the geometrical acceptance of the  spectrometer set - up , the path - length from target to detectors , kaon decay in flight , and kaon scattering were determined by a monte carlo simulation using the simulation package geant4 . within the a1 collaboration a different simulation package ( simul++ ) for the experiments was developed in the past .",
    "this code allows to simulate , according to a chosen kinematics , the phase - space accepted by the spectrometers . in alternative",
    ", the events can be generated sampling a distribution given by the cross - section of a specific process .",
    "the output of the geant4 study was implemented in this simulation as a generalised acceptance map , leading to the phase - space accepted by the combination of the kaon spectrometer with the electron spectrometer together with the radiative corrections . by virtue of the monte carlo technique used to perform this integral the quantities @xmath48 and @xmath49 are not available separately or on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the general acceptance can be written in terms of the cross - section at a given point @xmath52 , called the scaling point , at @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , when studying the dependence on the remaining variable @xmath57 : @xmath58 then , the behaviour of the cross - section across the acceptance needs to be scaled according to a given theoretical description .",
    "the kaon - maid  @xcite isobar model was implemented in this analysis , however , one can as well use the full ( sl ) and the simplified version ( sla ) of the so - called saclay - lyon model  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : crosssections ] .",
    "the data points are compared to the kaon - maid model , to a variant of that model , and to the saclay - lyon model .",
    "it is expected that the final results will constrain the existing phenomenological models and generate theoretical interest .",
    "the difference between photo- and electroproduction data at small @xmath27 is very important as various models predict different transitions between the photoproduction point and the electroproduction cross - section .",
    "if , _ e.g. _ , the kaon - maid model was right , then the electroproduction data would be at @xmath64 0.5 a factor 2.5 larger than the photoproduction data .",
    "the data then could help to fix the unknown longitudinal coupling constants in this kinematical region .",
    "using the recently installed magnetic spectrometer  and a high - resolution spectrometer in coincidence it was possible measure elementary kaon electro - production at mami in a kinematic regime not covered by other experiments .",
    "the most interesting kinematic region is at at very forward laboratory angles .",
    "precise data from very forward angle kaon production are urgently required for calculating hypernuclear production cross - sections . in this kinematics the elementary amplitude serves as the basic input , which determines the accuracy of predictions for hypernuclei  @xcite .",
    "the detection of kaons in this angular range and the tagging of nearly zero - degree electrons will be achieved at mami in the very near future by steering the primary beam through the  spectrometer after passing through a magnetic chicane comprising two compensating sector magnets .",
    "the compact design of  and its capability to detect negatively and positively charged particles simultaneously under forward scattering angles complement the existing spectrometers . fig .  [ fig : kaos ] shows the layout of the coming experiments with the  spectrometer at zero degree . in order to use  as a zero - degree double - arm spectrometer a new electron - arm focal - plane detector system was built .",
    "it consists of two vertical planes of 18,432 fibres .",
    "detectors and electronics for the 4,608 read - out and level-1 trigger channels have been installed and tested .        for the year 2011 elementary kaon electroproduction measurements with the  spectrometer at zero degree scattering angle using the commissioned beam chicane and a first hypernuclear decay - pion spectroscopy experiment using the  spectrometer as kaon tagger are planned .",
