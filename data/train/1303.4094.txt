    "to `` solve the pulsar '' , one needs to describe the production , motion , and radiation of electrons and positrons .",
    "aristotelian electrodynamics ( ae ) describes the motion and curvature radiation of charges in a strong electromagnetic field .",
    "ae is applicable to pulsars .",
    "ae appears to be ready ( after going 3d , high resolution ) to calculate the lightcurves and spectra of weak pulsars ( insignificant pair production near the light cylinder ) . for strong pulsars ( high rates of pair production near the light cylinder ) , one needs to add the relevant qed kinetics",
    "this seems to be doable (  4.3 ) , but there is another problem . at high production rates , our ae code behaves in an unclear manner .",
    "since the code was written by a numerical amateur , there must be room for improvement .",
    "in  2 we describe aristotelian electrodynamics , in  3 we use ae to calculate the pulsar magnetosphere , in  4 we discuss how ae can be used to calculate the pulsar emission .",
    "in pulsar - strength electromagnetic field , because of strong radiation damping , velocities rather than accelerations of positrons and electrons are given by the local electromagnetic field : [ ae ] * v*_=*e*(b_0*b*+e_0*e*)b^2+e_0 ^ 2 . here the scalar @xmath0 and the pseudoscalar @xmath1 are the proper electric and magnetic fields defined by b_0 ^ 2-e_0 ^ 2=b^2-e^2 ,   b_0e_0=*b * ,   e_00 .",
    "equation ( [ ae ] ) gives unit velocities ( speed of light @xmath2 ) .",
    "the charges actually move slightly slower than light ( see  4 ) .",
    "is large , the charges move at high lorentz factors , ( ii ) where @xmath0 is small , the sign of @xmath1 frequently changes and the charges move at an average velocity below @xmath3 . ]",
    "equation ( [ ae ] ) says that in the frames where @xmath4 is parallel to @xmath5 , the charges move at the speed of light parallel and antiparallel to @xmath4 . as they move along ( [ ae ] ) , the charges are pulled by @xmath0 and dragged by the curvature radiation .",
    "we will assume that a charge reaches the terminal lorentz factor before it moves over the characteristic length scale of the field .",
    "for pulsars , where all the action is near the light cylinder ( see below ) , this requirement of instantaneous parallel dynamics reads [ app ] l_sdl_e ( rr_e ) ^2/3 , where @xmath6 is the spin - down power , @xmath7 is the light cylinder radius , @xmath8 is the angular velocity of the star , @xmath9 cm is the classical electron radius , @xmath10erg / s is the `` classical electron luminosity '' . in astrophysical notation ,",
    "the applicability condition ( [ app ] ) reads [ appa ] l_345.710 ^ -5 p_ms^2/3 , where @xmath11 is the spin - down power in units of @xmath12erg / s and @xmath13 is the pulsar period in ms . the applicability condition ( [ appa ] ) is satisfied , and by a large margin , by all pulsars in the fermi catalog ( abdo et al 2010 ) .",
    "to calculate the pulsar magnetosphere , one needs to solve maxwell equations .",
    "maxwell equations can be solved ( numerically ) if one knows the electric current @xmath14 . according to ae ,",
    "the current is [ cur ] * j*=_+*v*_+-_-*v*_- , where @xmath15 is the positron charge density , @xmath16 is the absolute value of the electron charge density , and @xmath17 is given by ( [ ae ] ) .",
    "the charge densities should be calculated from the continuity equations [ con ] + ( _ * v*_)=q , where @xmath18 is the plasma production rate .      in our previous ae calculation of the pulsar ( gruzinov 2012a ) , instead of modeling the plasma production @xmath18 , we postulated an expression for the charge - normalized number density @xmath19 , _ 0_++_- .",
    "( we used @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the electric charge density , @xmath22 is the spherical radius , and @xmath23 is a dimensionless parameter which we varied . )    once the plasma density @xmath19 is postulated , equation ( [ cur ] ) becomes an ohm s law ",
    "an expression giving @xmath14 in terms of the electromagnetic field  [ ohm ] * j*=+_0(b_0*b*+e_0*e*)b^2+e_0 ^ 2 , = .",
    "now the magnetosphere can be calculated in terms of the electromagnetic degrees of freedom only .",
    "the result of the calculation was non - trivial .",
    "it turned out , that the magnetosphere hardly depends on the assumed `` fiducial multiplicity '' @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , we claimed to have calculated the universal value of the pulsar efficiency ( the ratio of the pulsed bolometric luminosity to the spin - down power ) : , where @xmath24 is the spin - dipole angle .",
    "the resulting @xmath24-averaged efficiency @xmath25 is in an overall agreement with the data , especially if one ignores brighter pulsars .",
    "since in ae the drag comes from the curvature radiation , one can also give a crude estimate of the photon energy ( see  4 ) @xmath26 .",
    "this again roughly agrees with the data if the brighter pulsars are ignored .",
    "given the insensitivity to the assumed multiplicity , one might think that the actual plasma production rate is irrelevant .",
    "but it is easy to see that this can not be right .",
    "suppose the plasma production rate near the light cylinder @xmath18 is high , q_gj , where @xmath27 is the goldreich - julian ( 1969 ) density , @xmath28 is the magnetic field at the light cylinder .",
    "what is the fate of all these constantly added charges ?",
    "the charges can not be removed faster than light , and the plasma density @xmath19 will be much higher than @xmath29 . the proper electric field @xmath0 has to be small in most of the volume  otherwise the damping rate @xmath30 would be much greater than @xmath31 . at small @xmath0 , and considering the axisymmetric case for simplicity , we see from ( [ ae ] ) that the poloidal motion of the charges is along the poloidal magnetic field . then at least one of the species has to move into the equatorial current layer ( see fig.1 ) . once inside the current layer , this species will have to experience the full potential drop of the current layer .",
    "this again results in more damping power than @xmath6 .",
    "the above argument is not in contradiction with the model of ( gruzinov 2012b ) , where we show that certain plasma production rates @xmath18 do give a fixed - multiplicity ae .",
    "these models require pair annihilation ",
    "negative @xmath18 values must be allowed .",
    "then both species move into the equatorial current layer and get annihilated there .",
    "but in real pulsars the annihilation rate should be very small , and such models should not be relevant .      for the aligned rotator , we have numerically integrated the full axisymmetric ae system : ( [ ae ] , [ cur ] , [ con ] ) plus maxwell equations [ mab ] = - , [ mae ] = -*j*. the plasma production was q=_1q_1+_2q_2 , where @xmath32 models the avalanche plasma production near the star ( ruderman and sutherland 1975 ) and @xmath33 models the plasma production by photon - photon collisions near the light cylinder .    for no particular reason we used q_1=(1.4r_s - r)(e_0-e_c )",
    "( 1-e_c^2e_0 ^ 2 ) , [ q2 ] q_2=(r)^21+(r)^6 , where @xmath22 is the spherical radius , @xmath34 is the radius of the star , @xmath35 is the critical field for the near - star avalanche , @xmath8 is the angular velocity of the star .",
    "further details of the model are given in the appendix .",
    "with no plasma production near the light cylinder ( fig.1 ) , we get a magnetosphere similar to ( gruzinov 2012b ) .",
    "since the equatorial current experiences a large potential drop , this pulsar will have a high efficiency .    for significant plasma production near the light cylinder ( fig.2 ) , the number of field lines closing beyond the light cylinder decreases .",
    "the equatorial current experiences a smaller potential drop , this pulsar will have a lower efficiency . the calculated damping rate , @xmath36 , indeed drops by about a factor of 2 .    at low plasma production , the simulation results seem to converge just as nicely as in a purely electromagnetic simulation of ( gruzinov 2012ab ) . but at significant plasma production , our code probably needs improvement or better understanding .",
    "the convergence of the code ( with time step and resolution ) is unclear to the author .",
    "the results of the calculation given in fig.2 have the status of an illustration .",
    "but since the underlying physics seems to be right , we decided to show this illustration .",
    "how small can the pulsar efficiency become at high multiplicity ?",
    "a crude estimate of  4 suggests that efficiency @xmath37 ca nt decrease too much below the ideal value of @xmath38 .",
    "observationally , even the strongest pulsar ( crab ) has efficiency @xmath39  just a factor of 10 below the mean ideal value ( x - ray dominated ; the light cylinder of crab can be opaque to high - energy gamma - rays ) .    from a purely theoretical perspective",
    ", the minimal efficiency problem is unclear to the author .",
    "our results seem to indicate that at high plasma production rates the ae magnetosphere approaches the standard zero - efficiency force - free magnetosphere of contopoulos et al ( 1999 ) and spitkovsky ( 2006 ) .",
    "but one needs to remember that the `` periodic axisymmetric pulsar '' ( gruzinov 2011 ) has a 100% efficiency even at an arbitrarily high multiplicity .",
    "according to ae , the poynting energy is extracted at the current layer just beyond the light cylinder .",
    "ae predicts the terminal lorentz factor of the charges @xmath40 : cee_0=23e^2cr_c^4 , where @xmath41 is the radius of curvature of the trajectory of a charge .",
    "@xmath41 is also predicted by ae . knowing @xmath40 and @xmath41 , one calculates the spectrum of the primary gamma - rays ( usually @xmath42 gev ) .    in weak pulsars",
    ", the primary gamma - rays must be dominating the emission , while being irrelevant for the plasma production  the plasma is produced only by the near - star avalanche . in strong pulsars , the situation seems to be more complicated .",
    "the fermi catalog lists 6 pulsars with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "these have the photon cutoff energy @xmath42gev . for 3 of these pulsars ,",
    "the data of possenti et al ( 2002 ) gives a crude upper bound for the x - ray luminosity .",
    "neglecting the geometric factors , one then gets a crude estimate for the plasma production near the light cylinder . comparing to the goldreich - julian density",
    ", we conclude that these pulsars are weak .",
    "these pulsars still have copious pair production near the star .",
    "since the plasma properties near the light cylinder seem to be insensitive to how exactly the near - star avalanche occurs , ae can be used directly to predict the lightcurves and spectra .",
    "it is already known ( bai , spitkovsky 2010 ) that postulating gamma - ray emission from the current layer beyond the light cylinder gives the lightcurves crudely consistent with observations .",
    "estimating pair production near the light cylinder for millisecond pulsars in the same manner as above , we also classify them as weak .",
    "but the near - star avalanche in millisecond pulsars probably requires careful modeling , because by the usual criteria ( ruderman , sutherland 1975 ) the avalanche is barely going .",
    "the near - star avalanche can noticeably contribute to the observed emission ( although the current layer emission can not be subdominant ) .",
    "below we describe one scenario for what might be happening near the light cylinder in strong pulsars  the `` light - cylinder avalanche '' . in this scenario ,",
    "careful modeling of kinetics seems to be a must for predicting the emission .    for the sake of the argument , take the light cylinder radius @xmath45 cm and the magnetic field near the light cylinder @xmath46 kg",
    "this would be a pulsar with @xmath47erg / s .",
    "let @xmath48 be the primary gamma - ray luminosity at about 1gev .",
    "neglecting geometry , we estimate the 1gev gamma - ray density at the light cylinder n_~_1l_sd4r^2c(1gev)~10 ^ 12_1cm^-3 .",
    "now send a test 1kev x - ray photon into the light cylinder region . with a probability p~rr_e^2n_~310 ^",
    "-5_1 the test x - ray photon will produce a pair  an electron and a positron of @xmath42gev energy .",
    "in the 100 kg magnetic field , the pair will emit @xmath49 x - ray photons of @xmath42kev energy . if @xmath50 , we get an avalanche .    in the simplest model , the pulsar balances at the threshold of the light - cylinder avalanche , @xmath51 .",
    "for @xmath52 , copious pair production near the light cylinder opens the field lines ( fig.2 . ) and the efficiency @xmath37 drops . for @xmath53 ,",
    "the avalanche disappears , pairs are no longer produced near the light cylinder and the field tries to return to the high - efficiency weak - pulsar configuration ( fig.1 ) .",
