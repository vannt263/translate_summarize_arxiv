    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) evolve from intermediate mass stars . during their evolution",
    "they go through the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and then into the pn phase , ending their days as white dwarfs .",
    "the formation and early evolution of pne are a poorly understood phase of stellar evolution .",
    "in particular , it is not clear yet how the spherically symmetric agb circumstellar shells transform themselves into the non spherical symmetries observed in the envelopes of evolved pne . during their agb phase stars",
    "lose most of their initial mass , their mass loss rates ranging from 10@xmath3 up to 10@xmath4  m@xmath5  yr@xmath6 .",
    "the star develops a wind that carries away from its photosphere the enriched material produced by nucleosynthesis and dredged up from the core to the surface .",
    "this ejected material eventually cools down and creates a circumstellar envelope of dust and gas , whose chemistry is determined by the c / o ratio in the stellar outer regions @xcite . when the star has evolved past the tip of the agb ,",
    "the dust and gas circumstellar envelope is typically so thick that the star can not be detected at optical wavelengths : the expansion and subsequent dilution of the envelope leads to the optical detection of post - agb stars .",
    "the end of the post - agb evolution can be identified as the onset of the ionization in the envelope , when the central star reaches temperatures around 2030@xmath7 k. the ionization is in fact considered as the beginning of the pn phase .",
    "studies of the infrared ( ir ) properties of agb and post - agb stars have determined that in o - rich envelopes silicate features at 10 and 18  @xmath1 m are first seen in emission during the agb , then in absorption when the envelope becomes optically thick , and then again in emission , after the envelope becomes optically thin to the mid - ir radiation @xcite .",
    "a similar evolutionary scheme is observed in c - rich envelopes , although with different spectral features .",
    "low - mass o - rich stars are not expected to develop an optically thick envelope , therefore the silicate features are never seen in absorption in these stars @xcite .",
    "a small fraction of post - agb stars and pne show both o - rich and c - rich features and are therefore classified as _ mixed - chemistry _ objects .",
    "the origin of their mixed chemistry is still uncertain .",
    "for example , in the red rectangle this has been explained as due to the presence of a circumbinary disk that was formed when the star was still o - rich and then served as a silicate reservoir , while the c - rich features originate in the dredged - up outflow @xcite .",
    "a different scenario has been proposed for high mass stars , in which _ hot bottom burning _",
    "would convert @xmath8c into @xmath9n and change a c - rich envelope back into an o - rich one @xcite .",
    "many observational programs have been carried out to find new planetary and proto - planetary nebulae among unidentified iras sources with far infrared colors similar to those of known pne @xcite , with the final aim of understanding pn formation through the discovery and analysis of new transition objects ( to ) . in these sources the physical processes associated with pn formation , such as dynamical shaping , are still occurring and , as the number of known to",
    "is extremely small , the identification and study of new samples is relevant for further testing current models of stellar evolution .    to detect new to , we have selected a sample of stars classified in the literature as post - agb on the basis of their iras colors and optical spectra .",
    "we have selected our stars from lists of post - agb candidates available in the literature @xcite , with the constraint of a b - type spectral classification and far - ir excess .",
    "the b spectral type implies the central star can be hot enough to have started to ionize the circumstellar envelope .",
    "this maximizes the chance that the objects are right in the transition from post - agb to pn , although misclassifications can not be ruled out .",
    "radio observations of this sample were carried out to check for the presence of free - free emission from ionized shells .",
    "these observations have been reported in @xcite and @xcite .    to further characterize our sample , we performed observations with the spitzer space telescope .",
    "mid - ir observations probe the extended envelopes that surround post - agb stars and young pne , which are in most cases only partly ionized .",
    "the main goals of such observations are to assess the morphology of the neutral gas and dust components and to characterize their mineralogy . comparing the results of these observations to the properties of the ionized gas , as derived from previous radio observations ,",
    "could in principle provide important clues on the shaping of the nebulae .",
    "as a follow - up to our radio detections , we observed 26 objects with the spitzer space telescope ( spitzer ) .",
    "infrared imaging was performed with the infrared array camera ( irac ) @xcite at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath1 m to search for faint extended emission .",
    "the observations were carried out in several spitzer campaigns in 2006 and 2007 ( program i d : 30036 ) .",
    "the irac observations were performed in high dynamic range mode . for each target we obtained 8 dithered frames , for a total on source time of about 96",
    "s per irac channel .",
    "basic calibrated data ( bcd ) were retrieved from the spitzer archive ( pipeline versions : s14.0.0 , s15.0.5 , and s16.1.0 ) , cleaned to correct such artifacts as mux - bleeding and banding and then coadded using iracproc @xcite .",
    "the photometry was performed by psf subtraction in the final mosaics .",
    "this technique has been specifically developed to perform photometry even in heavily saturated objects @xcite .",
    "the method derives vega magnitudes of saturated stars by fitting the low level features of the saturated psf ( diffraction spikes and psf wings ) with a model of the irac psf obtained from a sample of bright stars @xcite .",
    "the psf is directly normalized to the irac observation of vega , therefore , by fitting it to the observed sources , magnitudes can be calculated with an accuracy within 13% independently of the standard irac flux calibration @xcite",
    ".    observations with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were performed within the same program in 2006 and 2007 .",
    "the observations were carried out in low spectral resolution mode ( r@xmath1060120 ) , covering the 538 @xmath1 m range , to assess the chemistry of the envelopes . each target",
    "was observed in all the available low resolution modules ( sl and ll ) with a ramp time of 6  s per cycle .",
    "two cycles per module were typically performed . those targets with iras 12 @xmath11 flux below 1 jy",
    "were observed for 3 cycles in the 5.214.5  @xmath12 modules , to keep a high enough s / n ( typically @xmath1050 ) .",
    "the irs pipeline version s17.2.0 ( partial ) bcds were retrieved from the archive .",
    "the sky subtraction was performed taking advantage of the way the data are acquired by default .",
    "each module has two sub - modules ( sl2 and sl1 , ll2 and ll1 ) observing at the same time , but not in the same direction .",
    "since the two sub - modules do not point the same target at the same time , when one is on - target , the other is performing a sky observation .",
    "the data taken by sl1 ( ll1 ) when sl2 ( ll2 ) is on target can then be used as a sky frame for a subsequent sl1 ( ll1 ) pointing and vice versa . for each bcd",
    ", we have averaged all the off - target observations and subtracted this from the single on - target bcds .",
    "the spectrum was extracted in every bcd with spice using the optimal point source extraction option .",
    "for each target , all its extracted spectra were then averaged and combined into one using smart @xcite .",
    "irac has proved to be a very sensitive instrument , revealing previously unseen structures in the outer shells of expanded pne @xcite .",
    "since the nebulae in our sample are typically very compact and ir - bright , which is normal for their evolutionary status , their core emission dominates the inner few arcsec near the central source .",
    "this unfortunately usually prevents us from detecting any weak extended emission near the core , but , by psf subtraction , does not prevent us from measuring the fluxes of our sources . given the size of the psf , an upper limit of @xmath105@xmath13 to the sizes of the nebulae can be estimated ( marengo , private communication ) .    in table",

    "more than @xmath2 of the stars in our sample show both polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) and silicate features , while a smaller percentage ( @xmath1010% ) is expected . among these mixed - chemistry objects about 70% are radio detected .",
    "we distinguished o - rich and c - rich envelopes on the presence of amorphous silicate ( 10-@xmath1 m bump ) or pah features ( mainly 6.2 and 7.7  @xmath1 m ) .",
    "objects with both a 10-@xmath1 m silicate feature and pah transitions were classified as mixed  chemistry .",

    "therefore , besides being a rare feature , the chances for its detection are even lower in b stars as those in our sample , because of the harder radiation field from the central star .",
    "the sources iras 01005 + 7910 and 19200 + 3457 show a strong broad feature around 30  @xmath1 m that has been previously observed in other post - agb stars and pne and is attributed to mgs .",
    "the peak position and width of this feature change as the temperature of the underlying continuum changes , corresponding to the evolution from post - agb to pn .",

    "the data points are sparse in the diagram : though a similar trend as in young stars might be present , we can not conclude that this is the case .",
    "the absence of linear correlation may be explained as due to non - linear effects in highly processed dust ( 11.3/9.8 flux ratio @xmath20 ) , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "our results match with those found by @xcite , who inspected disks around post - agb stars .",
    "the similarity of the results leads us to the conclusion that in spite of the absence of correlation , the dust in our targets shows a high degree of processing , which points to the presence of a stable structure where the grains can have time to grow and anneal .",

    "this trend for a decrease of ionization fraction in the post - agb has been reported in @xcite for 3 objects .",
    "we find this as a general trend within our sample .",
    "since the ionization fraction does not seem to correlate with the temperature of the central star , we tried to link it to the local physical conditions experienced by the pahs , by plotting the i@xmath25i@xmath26 ratio versus the ionization factor g@xmath29n@xmath30t@xmath31 , where g@xmath29 is the radiation field in habing units , n@xmath30 the electron density in @xmath32 , and t the gas temperature in 10@xmath33 k. we have calculated this parameter by applying the empirical formula in @xcite that links it to i@xmath27i@xmath26 in its lorentzian formulation , since it extends to lower values of i@xmath27i@xmath26 . in figure",

    "once again , no clear correlation with t@xmath28 is observed , indicating that the local conditions in the envelope play a major role .",
    "the results of our analysis of the pah features are somewhat conflicting .",
    "on one side we see that the central wavelengths of the features are shifted toward the blue , as expected in photo - processed molecules ; on the other side , we find a low ionization fraction , which implies low processing .",
    "we conclude that a higher effective temperature implies a harder field and stronger processing in terms of shift of the central wavelength toward the blue , but not necessarily a higher ionization fraction , this being dependent on the available amount of ionizing photons , thefore on the distance to the central star .",
    "our plots indicate that the pah molecules in our stars are located in the outflows , where they are subject to a more diluted field .",
    "although the probability of interaction between photons and molecules far from the star is smaller , the hard photons from the central star - when interacting - determine a major damage to the molecules , resulting in the shift in central wavelength . in this scenario ,",
    "the closer molecules must have been previously destroyed by the radiation field .",
    "since pah features with red central wavelengths are found in post - agb stars ( rafgl  2688 is one of the two class _ c _ objects in @xcite ) , this disruption should occur during the few 10@xmath33  yr between the early post - agb and the development of an ionized shell .",
    "high - angular resolution observations in the pah emission ranges are necessary to support such an interpretation , which confirms the idea of c - bearing molecules being located in the outflows of mixed - chemistry nebulae .",
    "finally , it must be noticed that the wavelength shifts observed can be determined not only by photo - processing : nitrogenation can in fact be another explanation @xcite .      as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the mass that goes into pahs can be linked to the ratio of the flux emitted in the pah features to the continuum flux in the far infrared range ( fir ) , nominally between 40 and 500  @xmath1 m . we have therefore taken advantage of our sed models ( see   [ seds ] ) to calculate the fir flux by integrating our curves in the mentioned interval .",

    "our models , though often reproducing the overall shape of the sed quite well , fail in reproducing the correct shape of the 10 @xmath1 m bump especially in its longer wavelength part , where it overlaps with the underlying rising continuum .",
    "the shape of the feature depends on several factors , including dust temperature , grain size , and composition .",

    "this can point out the presence of additional hot dust , but another possibility is the presence of a free - free contribution from the ionized envelope , which is neglected in dusty .",

    "we have modeled the radio continuum spectra assuming the central star is surrounded by a shell of ionized gas with constant density .",
    "the usual approximation of the gaunt factor at radio wavelengths typically results into a quick cutoff of the free - free emission in the far - ir , where , compared to the dust emission , such contribution is indeed negligible .",
    "nevertheless , in the near - ir , where the central star and dust fluxes are at a minimum , the free - free contribution to the observed flux may not be much smaller than the contributions from the other emitting components .",

    "therefore , we decided to estimate the gaunt factor following @xcite for a 10@xmath58 k electron temperature , extending the calculation of the emission curve from the cm range to 0.8 @xmath1 m . for details about the radio modeling ,",
    "see @xcite .    where radio data were available , we summed up the free - free and dust model contributions",
    ". this often results into a substantial correction to the dust - only model , not only in the cm range , as expected , but also in the near - ir . in figures  [ fig : dusty1 ] and [ fig : dusty2 ] we show examples of the performed dusty and radio fits for about half of our sample .            during the various trials performed to match the data , we have found that in some sources it is necessary to add an extra - component that does not match chemically with the classification of the target .",
    "specifically , in half of the o - rich targets ( iras 17364 - 1238 , 17542 - 0603 , 18435 - 0052 , 19157 - 0247 , 20572 + 4919 ) we had to include an am - c component to match the observational points . similarly , in two of the c - rich sources ( iras 06556 + 1623 and 19200 + 3457 ) we had to include a silicate component . it must be considered that this may be due to limits in the modeling code , in particular the current knowledge of the opacity coefficients in the mid - ir , and does not necessarily represent a mixed - chemistry nature of the targets .",
    "iras 17423 - 1755 has been modeled with amorphous carbon grains , although it does not show any pah features .",
    "this target is reported to show c@xmath59h@xmath59 absorption feature @xcite , which indicates it has a c - rich chemistry .",
    "such a chemistry also matches with its featureless mid - ir spectrum . in our attempts to model it with silicates",
    ", we have found that if silicates were present they would determine a distinct 10-@xmath1 m emission feature , because of their high temperature ( peak in irac bands ) . in two targets showing both pah and silicate features ( iras 18379 - 1707 and 21289 + 5815 ) a silicate - only",
    "chemistry is sufficient to fit the continuum spectrum .",
    "iras 17423 - 1755 is our only target with mm measurements @xcite .",
    "we have assumed as size of the dust region the angular size of its co shell as reported in @xcite , @xmath102@xmath13 , with a distance of 5.8 kpc and luminosity 12600 l@xmath5 .",
    "when using in dusty the opacity calculated at 60 @xmath1 m from the iras data , we find that the model highly overestimates the far - ir emission .",
    "changes in the opacity input value do not improve the model , nor do different density distributions ( we tried r@xmath6 and r@xmath60 ) .",
    "a good match can be obtained if a maximum grain size of 100 @xmath1 m is introduced ( figure  [ fig:17423 ] ) .",
    "this is remarkable , since hints for such large grains have been found so far only in a handful of stars , such as the red rectangle @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that in another target , iras 20462 + 3416 , our point at 1 cm seems not to follow the free - free curve , being well above it ( see figure  [ fig : dusty1 ] ) .",
    "if we combine this to the shape given by the iras long - wavelength data points , we can speculate that this target might have an excess of radiation in the sub - mm as well .",
    "we could not classify iras 18367 - 1233 because the iras coordinates turned out to be off - set respect to the actual position of the target , as we can see in our irac images .",
    "since the irac imaging was not available at the time of the irs observations , the target resulted to be out of the irs slits .",
    "modeling our sources allows us to estimate the mass of the envelopes of our targets .",
    "we follow here the procedure in @xcite .",
    "the mass is estimated as @xmath61 in eq .",
    "[ eq : dustmass ] @xmath51 is the inner radius of the envelope , @xmath62 is the outer - to - inner radius ratio , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the optical depth and the absorption coefficient at 100  @xmath1 m , and @xmath65 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "no distance information is available for most of our targets , therefore we assume as @xmath51 a typical value of 10@xmath66  cm .",
    "@xmath62 is the value given as input in dusty and @xmath63 is given by the code as an output . for @xmath65 ,",
    "whose value depends on the evolutionary stage , we consider a typical value of 200 .",
    "@xmath64 depends on the chemistry of the envelope : we use 92  g  @xmath40 for amorphous carbon @xcite and 34  g  @xmath40 for silicates @xcite .",
    "we have used the values for silicates not only in the targets that we have classified as o - rich , but also in mixed - chemistry environments , neglecting any contribution from c - bearing molecules . as already noticed by @xcite",
    ", the code seems to underestimate the amount of cold dust in the envelope or anyhow not to be very sensitive to the contribution from such grains .",
    "if we also consider that we lack measurements in the sub - mm / mm range - which would help constrain the cold - dust emission - the values listed in table  [ tab : masse ] are to be regarded as lower limits to the circumstellar mass .",

    "2mass and iras data were combined with our irac and radio observations to construct the seds of the sample stars .",
    "dusty modeling shows the presence of more than one emitting component in the dust envelopes and indicates that dust temperatures range from @xmath101000 k to @xmath10100 k. the modeling also gives hints about the presence of large ( @xmath70 1 @xmath1 m ) grains , although sub - mm and mm observations are necessary to constrain the seds in these ranges , where such grains would give a major contribution . as an example , in iras 17423 - 1755 it is necessary , to account for its mm emission , to have three dust components ( at 1150 , 132 , and 80 k ) with grain size up to 100 @xmath1 m ( see fig  [ fig:17423 ] ) .",
    "the irs spectra we obtained allow us to classify the to candidates as c - rich , o - rich , or mixed - chemistry .",
    "we have classified as mixed - chemistry objects those stars with both a 10 @xmath1 m silicate bump and pah features in the 611  @xmath1 m range . a possible explanation for the mixed chemistry involves the presence of a circumbinary disk / torus , where o - bearing molecules would be preserved from the third dredge up , while elsewhere in the outflow features from c - bearing molecules would arise .",
    "this picture appears to be confirmed by our analysis of the pah features , which indicates that pah molecules in our targets are not located close to the central star .",
    "since these objects are typically compact ( @xmath102@xmath13 ) , sub - arcsec imaging may evidence if different dust species have different spatial distributions . in most of our targets with o - rich dust",

    "such processing , which typically consists in dust growth and crystallization , indicates again the presence of large dust grains and/or of crystalline silicates and more interestingly is a further hint for the presence of a circumstellar / circumbinary disk : a stable structure where the grains can have the time to grow and crystallize .    whereas the expected fraction of mixed - chemistry envelopes is less than 10%",
    ", we find that about 40% of the stars in our sample show both pah and silicate features . our sample has been selected on the basis of b optical spectral type and far - ir excess .",
    "these two conditions are indeed typical of hot post - agb stars .",
    "nevertheless , selections based on infrared thermal emission ( iras fluxes , for instance ) introduce a bias towards far - ir bright objects . among post - agb stars , objects hosting a disk or torus are stronger ir emitters .",
    "these circumstellar ( or circumbinary ) structures are highly stable and store the dust around the central star / s on a much longer time - scale than in stellar envelopes without a disk / torus @xcite . as these envelopes are brighter and live longer , selections based on far - ir emission are biased towards stars surrounded by a disk or torus .",
    "the higher percentage of mixed - chemistry envelopes in our sample can therefore be connected to a higher percentage of disks ( or tori ) .",
    "this confirms the general picture of a disk / torus as a reservoir preserving o - bearing molecules from the third dredge up .",
    "if we refer to the red rectangle as an example , mixed chemistry and large grains are linked together by the presence of a disk , where the particles can survive enough orbits to grow by coagulation to sizes as large as 1  mm @xcite . with only a few examples of this phenomenon , several hints for it found in this project",
