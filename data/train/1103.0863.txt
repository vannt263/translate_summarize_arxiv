    "paul s cathedral is famous for its rich history and architecture ; one of the most unique aspect of this building is the whispering gallery that runs along the interior wall of its dome @xcite .",
    "when sounds are uttered in low voice against the wall , sound waves generated circulate around the wall many times before fading away .",
    "as these waves propagate , they bring with them sounds that are audible on the opposite side of the dome . on the contrary , if the same sounds are uttered at higher volume , the frequencies of these sounds waves will not match and a lot of noise is created , making the message difficult to be heard at any part of the wall .    the physical explanation of this effect was firstly given more than a century ago in terms of reflection of acoustic _",
    "rays _ from a surface near the dome apex .",
    "it was initially assumed that the rays that propagate along different large arcs of the dome in a form of a hemisphere should concentrate only at the point diametrically opposite to the source of the sound .",
    "afterwards lord rayleigh , in his _ theory of sound _",
    "@xcite , provided a different explanation of the effect that he named _ whispering gallery waves _ : sound clutches to the wall surface and creeps along it without diverging as fast as during the free space propagation : these sound waves then propagate within a narrow layer adjacent to the wall surface .",
    "it was then discovered , at the beginning of the last century , that optical whispering gallery waves can exist even in dielectric spheres @xcite .",
    "an optical resonator that shows this particular wave structure was then called _ whispering gallery resonator _ ( wgr ) . in recent times",
    "whispering gallery waves have found new fame with the development of nano - optics , in particular with the ability to manufacture spherical and toroidal wgr with very high quality factors that ranges from @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this motivated a large theoretical and experimental work around these devices ( see for example ref . @xcite and references therein ) . the ability to store light in microscopic spatial volumes for long periods of time ( due to the high @xmath3-factor ) resulted in a significant enhancement of nonlinear interactions of various kinds like four - wave mixing @xcite , raman @xcite , parametric and brillouin scattering @xcite , microwave up - conversion @xcite , second and third order harmonic generation @xcite .",
    "besides the field of nonlinear optics , wgrs were recently used even for cavity qed experiments @xcite . for",
    "an exhaustive review on the applications of wgrs see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since many of the applications of these resonators involve nonlinear optics , wgr are commonly fabricated using nonlinear materials or anisotropic crystals @xcite . despite the wide scientific production in the theory of anisotropic",
    "spherical resonators , that ranges from generalization of scattering methods @xcite , potential method @xcite , dyadic green function approach @xcite and fourier - based analysis @xcite , and even though an extensive study of isotropic wgrs was done in the past @xcite , detailed studies on anisotropic wgrs are still very few . to the knowledge of the authors anisotropic wgrs",
    "are mainly reported in literature as studied with fdtd models @xcite , cavity loading @xcite and direct solution of maxwell s equation with a surface nonlinear polarization as a forcing term @xcite .    in this work , we intend to develop a suitable analytic theory for wgrs , starting from a review of the solutions of maxwell s equations in an uniaxial spherical resonator , then presenting and discussing its mode structure in the limit of small anisotropy , and finally obtaining the spectrum of whispering gallery modes sustained by the resonator and their structure , discussing how anisotropy influence those modes .",
    "a detailed discussion on the application of boundary conditions to this resonator is also presented , pointing out how to apply correctly these conditions and discussing some of their basic features that , to the knowledge of the authors , is not present in earlier works .",
    "it is opinion of the authors that this discussion is important in order to better understand the physics behind this problem .",
    "this is the first main result of this work .",
    "finally , we introduce a more accurate approximation for the field outside the resonator when the index of the hankel function tends to infinity , as we noticed that the commonly used power expansion ( as , for example , the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) does not match the exact function completely , i.e. it has an additional phase factor respect to the real function .",
    "such phase factor becomes relevant when field amplitude , as opposed to field intensity , turn to be fundamental .",
    "this happens , for example , when one wants to quantize the electromagnetic field inside the resonator , as required for a proper treatment of spontaneous emissions processes .",
    "thus , the present work may serve as basis for a quantum theory of wgrs .",
    "this is the second main result of this work .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii the debye method of potentials for solving maxwell s equations is briefly presented and then used in section iii to develop the theory of an anisotropic spherical resonator for a dielectric uniaxial sphere . in section iv , _ whispering gallery modes _ ( wgms ) are obtained as limiting case of the normal modes of the dielectric sphere with high quantum numbers and their spectrum is discussed .",
    "before considering the problem of an uniaxial spherical resonator , it is pedagogical to briefly review the method of debye potentials @xcite , largely used to solve maxwell s equations in integrable systems .",
    "let us consider a monochromatic field with an harmonic time dependence ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) in an isotropic sourceless domain @xmath5 ; maxwell s equations inside @xmath5 can be written in the following symmetric form : +    [ maxeqgeneral ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the wavevector in vacuum and and @xmath8 is the dielectric constant inside @xmath5 .",
    "in order to fully determine the fields , it is necessary to specify their values on the domain boundary @xmath9 .",
    "electromagnetic boundaries are usually of two types : perfectly conducting walls ( the field is zero on @xmath9 ) , or open systems , where the field components inside @xmath5 and the ones outside @xmath5 must match on @xmath9 . the boundary , together with symmetry considerations , gives a hint on which is the more suitable coordinate system to be used to solve the problem ( e.g. spherical coordinates for spheres , cilindrical coordinates for wires etc . ) @xcite .",
    "let us specify our problem by considering an open system constituted by a sphere of dielectric constant @xmath8 and radius @xmath10 surrounded by an isotropic medium ( i.e. air ) @xcite .",
    "the set of maxwell s equations in the spherical reference frame can be written in the following compact form : +    [ maxwell ] @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the spherical coordinates ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 are the metric coefficients of the spherical reference frame ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the levi - civita symbol @xmath21 on the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "is equal to 1 if @xmath22 is equal to @xmath23 or any of its even permutation , is equal to @xmath24 for any odd permutation of @xmath23 and equal to zero elsewhere .",
    "in this reference frame , the fields can be decomposed in the so - called transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) waves : te waves are characterized by having @xmath25 , i.e. the electric field is transveral with respect to the radial direction @xmath26 .",
    "tm waves are instead characterized by having the magnetic field transveral with respect to the radial direction ( i.e. @xmath27 ) @xcite . for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "let us fix our attention on tm waves ; the calculations for te waves can be straightforward obtained by analogy . from eqs . for @xmath28 , by substituting @xmath27 it is possible to introduce the @xmath29 function such that +    [ potw ] @xmath30    by substituting relations into eqs",

    "therefore , all the components of the electric field are expressed in terms of the @xmath33 potential solely . in order to explicit them ,",
    "it is necessary to find the equation which the @xmath33 potential satisfy .",
    "to do this , we can use one of the last two equations left available from eq .",

    "the solution is straightforward .",

    "while the complex exponential is a solution of eq . .",
    "@xmath54 is a normalization constant that guarantees that the integral over the solid angle is unitary .",
    "the radial equation can be transformed into a bessel equation by the substitution @xmath55 that brings to : + @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 ; the solutions to this equation are the four bessel functions @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "physically , the solution inside the sphere must be finite at the origin , and the only plausible solution is @xmath59 because @xmath60 has a divergence at the origin .",
    "outside the sphere , instead , the solution should have the form of a runaway wave with the sommerfeld condition at the infinity ( i.e. , the solution must drop at infinity as the inverse square of the distance ) .",
    "for this reason the correct solution in this domain is the hankel function of the first kind @xmath63 because its asymptotic form decreases to zero as the inverse square of the distance for @xmath64 . putting everything together , the tm debye potential reads as follows : + @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the angular quantum numbers that address the single mode of the resonator , @xmath67 is the radial bessel - type function that is equal to the bessel function @xmath68 inside the dielectric sphere , and is equal to the hankel function of the first kind @xmath69 outside the dielectric sphere .",
    "the constants @xmath70 are to be determined by applying suitable boundary conditions .",
    "note that the argument of the bessel function inside the sphere contains the sphere dielectric constant @xmath8 via the wavevector @xmath7 while the argument of the hankel function outside the sphere contains only the vacuum wavevector @xmath71 because @xmath72 .",

    ", the wave vector @xmath78 inside the dielectric sphere has to match the wave vector @xmath71 outside the sphere and the constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 should be chosen properly . + there is not a unique way to fulfill boundary conditions : in fact , one could apply  pure \" or ",
    "mixed \" conditions : the former consists in applying the boundary conditions to all the components of only electric _ or _ magnetic field , while the latter applies the boundary to certain components of one field and certain other components of the other field .",

    "the condition for the radial component of the displacement vector ( @xmath83 ) across the resonator surface gives the ratio between the inner and outer coefficients + @xmath84 while the continuity of the tangential component @xmath85 of the field gives rise to the so called characteristic equation , that allows to determine the allowed values for the wave vector @xmath78 ( i.e. , to find the spectrum of the allowed modes ) inside the resonator , and it turns out to be + @xmath86'}{j_{\\nu}(kr)}=\\sqrt{\\varepsilon } \\frac{[h_{\\nu}^{(1)}(k_0r)]'}{h_{\\nu}^{(1)}(k_0r)},\\ ] ] for tm waves and @xmath87'}{j_{\\nu}(kr)}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon } } \\frac{[h_{\\nu}^{(1)}(k_0r)]'}{h_{\\nu}^{(1)}(k_0r)},\\ ] ] for te waves . in these equations @xmath88 and @xmath89",

    "although formally corrected , as they are these boundary conditions do not provide a unique solution to the determination of the mode patterns in the resonator .    in order to better understand this not - uniqueness of the solution ,",
    "let us consider the general structure of eqs . and .",
    "let @xmath92 be a piecewise function defined across an interface , placed at @xmath93 , between two region of space , such that @xmath94 for @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 , with @xmath98 and @xmath99 two arbitrary real valued and regular functions .",

    "this fact makes only possible to obtain the ratio between the two constants @xmath119 and not their explicit value : in order to do that , another condition must be applied to the problem .",
    "this condition depends on the particular problem we are dealing on ; in scattering problems , for example , the incoming field is known , and determines the field pattern on the resonator surface . in this case",
    "@xmath80 is known and the ambiguity is removed .",
    "another situation in which the ambiguity is overcome is by embedding the whole system ( resonator plus surrounding medium ) in an ideal perfectly reflective sphere of big , but finite radius @xmath120 , in such a way that the boundary conditions at the metallic surface will completely determine the fields : this second approach is very useful if we are dealing with the quantization of the field in such a system .",
    "we want to end this discussion by pointing out that the first situation ( derivative continuous at the interface ) corresponds to the boundary condition for the electric field across a dielectric surface : the normal component with respect to the separation surface is discontinuous by a factor equal to the ratio of the two dielectric constants of the two regions , while the tangential components ( i.e. , the derivative of the radial field in our spherical case ) is continuous at the interface . the second situation , instead , corresponds to put continuous the normal component of the displacement vector across the separation surface , resulting in a discontinuity of the tangential component of the displacement vector at the interface . while the former correspond to the usual way of imposing boundary conditions in an electromagnetic problem , the latter is never used , but still valid .",
    "in this work , however , we are neither interested on scattering problems nor on field quantization , and so in the rest of the paper this ambiguity will not be removed .",
    "this does not create too much problems because we are only interested on the mode structure of the resonator .",
    "we leave this problem of not - uniqueness to future works .",
    "let us consider the same dielectric spherical resonator of radius @xmath10 of the previous section , but with an uniaxial anisotropy along the @xmath121-axis described by the following dielectric tensor : + @xmath122 in order to use this dielectric tensor in eqs .",

    "we have then defined @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the fact that the tensor components depend on the polar coordinate @xmath133 makes the problem to find the eigenmodes of the spherical resonator much more difficult .",
    "moreover , in an anisotropic system it is in general no longer possible to divide the electric and magnetic fields in their tm and te components . in order to overcome the latter problem",
    ", we will focus our attention on the case of small anisotropy , i.e. @xmath134 ( this approximation is very good if we consider , for example , a dielectric sphere made of lithium niobate ( @xmath135 ) for which we have @xmath136 , @xmath137 and therefore @xmath138 ) . in such a way the fields can be decomposed in quasi - te and quasi - tm oscillations , allowing us to solve the problem using the method of debye potentials illustrated above .",
    "to this aim , and for the sake of clearness , let us rewrite the set of eqs .",
