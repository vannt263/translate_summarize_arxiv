    "the effects of magnetic fields on quantum particles is of great interest , which already yielded the observation of many exotic quantum phases in experiments , such as hofstadter butterfly @xcite and quantum hall effects @xcite in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems .",
    "more exotic behavior , including spin liquid @xcite , bosonic integer quantum hall effect @xcite , density - dependent synthetic magnetism @xcite are proposed and engineered based on the uniform ( or density - dependent ) gauged fields @xcite .",
    "ultra - cold atoms offer a clean and controllable platform to simulate these many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the synthetic magnetic fields were recently generated to realize hofstadter butterfly in ultra - cold gases using laser assisted tunneling in 2d optical lattices @xcite .",
    "it is well known that 2d hofstadter model can be mapped to one - dimensional ( 1d ) harper ( or aubry - andr ) model @xcite , where periodic chemical potentials serve the same effect as magnetic fields .    besides the realization of magnetic fields in 2d systems , chiral currents and vortex and meissner phases were also observed with an artificial magnetic field in bosonic ladders @xcite .",
    "ladder systems with fluxes were also modelled experimentally with purely 1d but multi - component bosonic  @xcite as well as fermionic  @xcite ultracold quantum gases , effectively realizing two - leg @xcite and three - leg ladders @xcite . in the latter two studies @xcite ,",
    "the sites along the rung direction correspond to the different hyperfine states , forming a synthetic lattice dimension @xcite .",
    "interacting bosonic ladder systems with uniform flux besides the above mentioned meissner and vortex phases that already exist for non - interacting particles , show various spontaneously symmetry broken phases @xcite .",
    "there has been relatively little work on topological phases in ladder systems with synthetic magnetic field .",
    "recently it was suggested that a ladder system in a uniform flux can mimic spin - orbit coupling and reproduce edge modes of 2d hofstadter model @xcite . in another recent",
    "work shows that a 1/2 laughlin - type fractional state can be realized in ladder systems with @xmath0 flux in every second plaquette @xcite .",
    "in addition , a triangular ladder - like geometry is exploited using trapped ions and atoms with next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite , showing that a uniform flux can split the dispersion and lead to topological phases , which are absent on a square ladder .     or along rungs",
    "i.e. @xmath1 , with the corresponding flux @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 in neighbouring plaquette .",
    "the total flux of a unit cell is @xmath5 + @xmath3 + @xmath4.,width=325 ]    in 1d systems , topological phases are usually introduced by a cosine - like modulation of either in chemical potentials @xcite or in hopping amplitudes @xcite .",
    "one may also engineer topological phases by a simple extension of the above schemes ( or two - component systems with spin - orbit coupling @xcite ) in ladders or in synthetic dimension lattices @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the above schemes , in this paper we focus on the effects of purely synthetic magnetic fields in ladder systems . using the exact diagonalization , we show that non - interacting fermionic ladders with periodic synthetic magnetic fields can reproduce the whole hofstadter - butterfly spectrum , non - trivial 2d topological band structures characterized by edge states and non - zero chern numbers .",

    "it is important to note that the flux of a unit cell of the system ( with @xmath44 ) is @xmath45 that is an integer multiple of @xmath0 .",

    "we note that these two branching hofstadter - butterflies are separated only when rung hoppings @xmath85 ( see fig.[density ] ) since it is a metallic phase @xcite for @xmath62 at @xmath49 and @xmath33 .",
    "to have a deeper understanding of topological phases , we present the whole phase diagram in fig.[phasediagram ] in @xmath86 plane using the exact diagonalization for @xmath70 rungs with @xmath6 and auxiliary angle @xmath44 . from it , one can follow nicely how topological phases evolute .    for @xmath87",
    ", the ladder is decoupled into two 1d free fermionic chains , for which magnetic fields can be gauged out . for @xmath88 and zero flux @xmath49 , @xmath44 , as mentioned before , the system is a metallic state for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for any @xmath23 . while at exactly half - filling @xmath59 , the system starts to develop a gap at @xmath91 ( at @xmath92 ) and become a band insulator .",
    "in contrast to zero - flux ladder , a gap opens immediately for any infinitezimal @xmath23 with a periodic magnetic field @xmath6 and @xmath44 , resulting in a topological phase with non - zero chern number @xmath75 at filling @xmath10 and @xmath76 .",
    "the whole band is split into 3 subbands : band a ( @xmath93 ) , band b ( @xmath94 ) and band c ( @xmath95 ) , separated by the filling @xmath10 and @xmath76 . further increasing the tunneling @xmath96 , band a and band c each start to split into two subbands resulting in a topological phase with chern number @xmath72 at filling @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath97 ( at @xmath92 at @xmath59 ) , the last band b gets starting to split , which happens earlier compared to the zero - flux free fermionic case ( @xmath98 ) .    in summary ,",
    "a ladder in a periodic magnetic field has more chance to form insulating phase because of the special band structure , preventing particles hopping from one subband to another .",
    "we have shown that a ladder system can present topological phases and hofstadter - butterfly - like energy spectrum with a periodic synthetic flux .",
    "the periodic synthetic magnetic field plays a similar role as superlattices in contrast to the uniform flux that induces a meissner phase and a vortex phase .",
    "edge states and non - zero chern numbers verify that insulating phases are non - trial topological phases .",
    "our study opens new questions : whether a ladder system with periodic flux can exhibit all similar physics as 1d chain model with superlattices .",
    "it would be very interesting to extend the system to interacting systems to check whether ladder systems with the periodic flux and long - range interactions can also give rise to a fractional topological phase @xcite , to check whether a many body localization phase can exist in interacting ladders when @xmath99 is an irrational number ( or when systems are placed in disordered magnetic fields ) @xcite",
    ".    it would be also very interesting to understand the physics of interacting hard - core bosonic and soft - core bosonic systems , where new phases are expected to appear as is the case for uniform flux @xcite .",
