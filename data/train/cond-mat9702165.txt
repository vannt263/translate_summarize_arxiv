    "<S> the specific heat jump at a normal - superconducting phase transition in an anisotropic superconductor with nonmagnetic impurities is calculated within a weak - coupling mean field approximation . </S>",

    "<S> this effect may be used as a test for the presence of an @xmath2-wave admixture in the cuprates .    there </S>",
    "<S> now exists a considerable experimental evidence supporting @xmath3-wave superconductivity in the cuprates , but the most direct probes of the superconducting state like the electromagnetic penetration depth , photoemission and quantum phase interference measurements neither confirm nor exclude a possible small @xmath2-wave admixture in a predominantly @xmath0 superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the linear temperature dependence of the penetration depth at low temperatures @xcite observed in ybco agrees with the theoretical predictions for a @xmath3-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , the measurements only went down to about 1k and an exponential behavior below this temperature , indicating a small nonzero gap minimum can not be eliminated . even by taking data at much lower temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a small @xmath2-wave component in the order parameter can not be entirely excluded in the penetration depth experiments . </S>",
    "<S> similar constraints limit the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) method . </S>",
    "<S> although arpes data @xcite are consistent with a @xmath0 scenario in bscco as well as in ybco , the experiments can not decide with an accuracy greater than an instrumental resolution if the order parameter completely vanishes at the @xmath0 nodal lines . </S>",
    "<S> this leaves the possibility of a small ( @xmath4 2mev ) @xmath2-wave admixture . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the above experimental methods do not rule out the presence of a small isotropic component , but place an upper bound on the minimum of the gap function . as analyzed in ref . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , the emerging picture from the josephson experiments supports a scenario of a real mixture of @xmath2 and @xmath0 states in ybco , but also does not definitely confirm the presence of the @xmath2-wave component . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of even a small @xmath2-wave admixture in a @xmath3-wave superconductor may be tested by thermodynamic measurements in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the @xmath3-wave state is strongly suppressed by the defects , @xcite and the @xmath2-wave state is not affected by the nonmagnetic scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in the case of ( @xmath5)-wave superconductor a power - law @xmath6 suppression @xcite should be observed above certain impurity - doping level and the thermodynamic properties at large impurity concentration should resemble those of the @xmath2-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the critical temperature of ybco is decreased below 12k by the electron - irradiation , @xcite and the pr - doping or ion - beam damage lead to a long tail @xmath6 suppression @xcite characteristic for a small nonzero value of the gap function integrated over the fermi surface . </S>",

    "<S> we study a nonmagnetic impurity effect on the specific heat jump at a superconducting - normal phase transition in anisotropic superconductors and show that the result depends on the fermi surface ( fs ) averages of the first four powers of the superconducting order parameter . a particularly large difference in the specific heat jump between the states with a nonzero and a zero value of the order parameter fs average is observed . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this measurement may be used as a test for the presence of an @xmath2-wave admixture in a @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath7 throughout the paper . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite this approach introduces two parameters describing the scattering process : @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the overall density of states at the fermi level , the impurity ( defect ) potential and the impurity concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we assume an @xmath2-wave scattering by the impurities , that is @xmath18 does not have an internal momentum- dependence . </S>",
    "<S> it is particularly convenient to think of @xmath20 as a measure of the scattering strength , with @xmath21 in the unitary limit and @xmath22 for weak scattering i.e. the born limit .    </S>",

( [ e17 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> agrees with that of an isotropic s - wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has a simple intuitive interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> a nonzero fermi surface average of the order parameter leads to an asymptotic power - law critical temperature suppression for large impurity concentration @xcite @xmath83^{(1 - 1/\\left < e\\right>^2)}$ ] , therefore @xmath6 is almost constant for large @xmath84 values . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity effect , then , in the large impurity concentration range is the same as in the case of s - wave superconductivity , where @xmath6 is not changed by the nonmagnetic impurities . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as it has been shown for the representative order parameters , @xcite the gap anisotropy is smeared out by the isotropic scattering when @xmath80 and the density of states approaches that of an isotropic @xmath2-wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , for @xmath72 we observe a strong impurity - induced suppression of the critical temperature @xcite leading to a zero value at finite impurity concentration , which is reflected by a zero specific heat jump limit value in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e18 ] ) . as a nonzero value of @xmath60 can be achieved only when @xmath9 contains a component belonging to an identity representation of the crystal point group , the measurement of the specific heat jump at the phase transition in the limit of @xmath78 ( and large impurity concentration ) may be used as a stringent test for the occurrence of even a small @xmath85 admixture to the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the effect at large impurity concentration for @xmath80 ( eq . ( [ e17 ] ) ) is independent of the amount of the @xmath2-wave content in the order parameter , however , as we discuss below , it may be hard to detect for a very small @xmath2-wave component as it would require an experiment at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> + we discuss our results in a context of high-@xmath6 superconductivity , considering a @xmath0 state , @xcite that is the order parameter given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e1 ] ) with @xmath86 . as we have mentioned above , </S>",
    "<S> our main result that is the value of the specific heat jump at @xmath78 is independent of the amplitude of the @xmath2-wave component and its origin . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to establish a quantitative behavior of @xmath87 in a whole range of impurity - doping we must work with a particular level of @xmath2-wave admixture . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by assuming that the @xmath2-wave component is an artifact of an orthorhombic anisotropy of the system and relate the amount of the @xmath2-wave admixture to the degree of this anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this approach gives a semi - microscopic justification for the @xmath88-wave state . </S>",
    "<S> the orthorhombicity in the case of ybco means that the @xmath89 and @xmath90 crystal axes in the @xmath91 planes become inequivalent , which leads , with a simple approximation of an elliptical fermi surface , to the following form of an energy band @xcite    @xmath92    where a ratio of the effective masses @xmath93 is a dimensionless parameter describing the orthorhombic anisotropy of the fermi surface and @xmath94 is the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to see within this model , that a ( @xmath1 ) state emerges from a @xmath0 in a natural way due to the orthorhombic distortion of the crystal lattice . a straightforward calculation based on a transformation from an elliptical fs to a circular </S>",
    "<S> one shows that the normalized @xmath0 order parameter defined on the fs given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e2 ] ) can be represented on a circular fs as    @xmath95^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\left[cos2\\varphi+\\frac{{\\displaystyle}1-\\frac{c_x}{c_y } } { { \\displaystyle}1+\\frac{c_x}{c_y}}\\right]\\ ] ]    where @xmath96 is the polar angle . in order to clarify the terminology </S>",
    "<S> , we will refer to the circular fermi surface when classifying the superconducting states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as a @xmath0 we define a state with @xmath9 proportional to @xmath97 and the states with a nonzero @xmath2-wave contribution are called ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note , that the order parameter from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e3 ] ) is @xmath0 when @xmath98 only , that is for a tetragonal symmetry , otherwise it contains a nonzero @xmath2-wave component proportional to @xmath99 . in tab . </S>",
    "<S> i we present as the functions of the orthorhombic anisotropy parameter @xmath93 the fermi surface averages which enter the ginzburg - landau coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 given in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e13 ] ) and ( [ e14a ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize , that the assumption of the orthorhombic asymmetry as the mechanism producing the @xmath2-wave admixture in the order parameter does not affect the results since only the amplitude of this component matters in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can obtain the same results in a more phenomenological way assuming the presence of the @xmath2-wave phase and taking its level as given by @xmath60 in tab . </S>",
    "<S> i for the @xmath93 values considered in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    based on the discussion of the specific heat jump for a large impurity concentration in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e17])-([e18 ] ) we can discuss this limit for @xmath3- and @xmath88-wave superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> for a pure @xmath100 state ( @xmath98 ) we have @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the specific heat jump decreases to zero with a critical temperature driven to zero by impurities as in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e18 ] ) . on the other hand , for even a slight s - wave component </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath80 and the specific heat jump increases and reaches a finite nonzero value at @xmath101 given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e17 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> below , we present the specific heat jump at the phase transition normalized by the specific heat in a normal state as a function of the normalized impurity scattering rate @xmath102 in the born limit ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) , where @xmath103 and in the unitary limit ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) with @xmath104 . note that @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a sample surface area , hence @xmath107 is different for different values of @xmath108 product . in the figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and 2b we show the same @xmath109 data versus the normalized critical temperature @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> the considered states contain a small @xmath2-wave admixture varying from about @xmath111 to @xmath112 , therefore we observe a strong @xmath6 suppression by the nonmagnetic impurities and a fast decrease in the specific heat jump as long as a significant @xmath3-wave component is present . once it is almost destroyed and the @xmath2-wave part , which is insensitive to the nonmagnetic defects , prevails , the bcs normalized specific heat jump value of about @xmath113 is restored in a sudden increase of @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the general tendency of the @xmath6 suppression , given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e9 ] ) at @xmath42 , changes at that doping level too and the critical temperature asymptotically goes to zero ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . for the sake of comparison </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 the specific heat jump @xmath87 normalized by @xmath65 as a function of the impurity scattering rate @xmath102 in the born and unitary limits for the ( @xmath114 ) state , where the @xmath2-wave component is large ( @xmath115 ) and the @xmath0 part is considered as minor .    one can notice from the above figures that the unitary and born scattering limits differ for small values of the pair - breaking parameter and fall on the same curve in the range where practically the @xmath2-wave superconductivity is only left . </S>",
    "<S> the pair - breaking parameter @xmath116 , however , has a different meaning in either case .    </S>",
    "<S> we have mentioned before that a detection of a small @xmath2-wave component would need a measurement at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , in a superconductor of the critical temperature in a clean limit @xmath117 the @xmath2-wave content of about @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) can be observed at a temperature of @xmath120 , which is the estimated position of @xmath109 minimum in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2a and 2b . </S>",
    "<S> this minimum is a place where a distinct signal from the @xmath2-wave component appears , therefore its position is of special interest for possible experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we have found the minimum coordinates @xmath121 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 ) and @xmath122 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 ) as the functions of the order parameter fs average value @xmath60 , which multiplied by @xmath123 gives the @xmath2-wave fraction in per cent in the normalized to unity order parameter @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> a plot of @xmath121 vs @xmath60 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 may be also of the experimental use , since the scattering rate @xmath116 is proportional to the impurity concentration , which can be estimated in the measurements . as one can see from figs . 5 and 6 </S>",
    "<S> the measurements at low temperatures are required for small @xmath2-wave admixtures , however , they are to be performed at the phase transition which should be accessible as long as @xmath6 is measurable . assuming that a possible @xmath2-wave admixture is of the order of magnitude of the experimental resolution error ( @xmath125 ) in the arpes measurements @xcite of the smallest energy gap values , we can estimate its fraction as a ratio @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is a measured maximum @xmath128 value . therefore from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 6 we get that the abrupt rise in the normalized specific heat jump should be observed at @xmath129 in a superconductor of the critical temperature in the absence of impurities @xmath117 </S>",
    "<S> . experiments @xcite investigating the disorder effect on the specific heat jump at @xmath6 in ybco show @xmath130 suppression to zero with the increasing impurity concentration . </S>",
    "<S> however , the magnetic defects , which act as the pair - breakers on both the @xmath3-wave and the @xmath2-wave states , were probably present in these studies .    </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that the effect of an abrupt rise in the specific heat jump at @xmath6 may be observed even in the purely @xmath3-wave superconductors in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath131 c - axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-wave component in this case may be induced by the vortices . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite + we have derived the specific heat jump from a mean field weak - coupling theory , neglecting the fluctuations and the strong - coupling effects . </S>",
    "<S> as the observation of thermodynamic fluctuations in the specific heat of crystals of ybco has been reported , @xcite we expect our bcs result to be modified by the deviations from the mean field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we hope , however , that the feature of a sharp upturn in the specific heat will be still present . </S>",
    "<S> the strong - coupling corrections will rescale the scattering rates @xcite and may change the magnitude of the specific heat jump . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite + in conclusion , we have calculated the electronic specific heat difference between superconducting and normal state at the phase transition as a function of nonmagnetic impurity scattering rate in the general case of an anisotropic superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the result depends on the symmetry of the order parameter , given by a function @xmath132 , and that of the fermi surface through the following fs averages : @xmath60 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 . a remarkably different dependence of the specific heat jump on the impurity concentration for the systems with @xmath72 and @xmath80 is observed . </S>",
