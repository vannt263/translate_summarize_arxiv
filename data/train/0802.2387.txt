    "graphene , the latest carbon allotrope to be discovered@xcite , is made out of carbon atoms organized into a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the characteristics of the honeycomb lattice make graphene a half filled system with a density of states ( dos ) that vanishes linearly at the neutrality point , and an effective , low energy quasiparticle spectrum characterized by a dispersion which is linear in momentum close to the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "these two features underlie the unconventional electronic properties of this material , whose low energy excitations behave as massless dirac fermions@xcite .",
    "there have been intensive theoretical and experimental studies on graphene to this date , for instance , half integer and unconventional quantum hall effect@xcite , quantum minimum conductivity@xcite , bipolar supercurrent@xcite , ferromagnetism@xcite , optical conductivity@xcite and the possibility of superconductivity@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the most interesting and promising properties from the technological point of view are its great crystalline quality , high mobility and resilience to very high current densities@xcite , the ability to tune the carrier density through a gate voltage@xcite , as well as the fact that graphene exhibits both spin and valley degrees of freedom which might be harnessed in envisaged spintronics@xcite . for a review of other remarkable properties of such systems as well as a discussion of possible technological applications ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref.@xcite .",
    "graphene is poised to become a new paradigm in solid state physics and materials science .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) is usually an excellent technique for probing the electronic properties of materials as it is sensitive to the dos near the fermi edge , and this method allows one to study static magnetic correlations and low - energy spin excitations . for a material with a fermi liquid state , the temperature dependent spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath8 follows the well - known korringa relation where @xmath9 varies linearly with temperature@xcite .",
    "as one of the most powerful methods for investigating mechanisms of superconductivity of the many exotic types of superconductors being discovered today , it has turned out that the explanation for the peak in the nmr relaxation rate just in superconducting state was that the dos peaked dramatically at the edge of a energy gap@xcite .",
    "recent nmr experiments by singer _",
    "et al . _ showed a deviation from fermi liquid behavior in carbon nanotubes with an energy gap evident at low temperatures@xcite . in the framework of the tomonaga - luttinger liquid",
    ", the low temperature properties are governed by a gapped relaxation due to a spin gap , which crosses over smoothly to the luttinger liquid behavior with increasing temperature@xcite .    in spite of being few atoms thick",
    ", the system of graphene was found to be stable and ready for exploration@xcite , and , it is believed that nmr should provide cornucopian and significant information on the electronic properties of graphene@xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the nmr relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility of graphene within a tight - binding description . at half filling , the nmr relaxation rate follows a power law as @xmath0 on the particle - hole symmetric side , while away from half filling and with a finite next - nearest neighbor @xmath2 , the @xmath3 terms dominate at low excess charge @xmath4 .",
    "the static spin susceptibility is linearly dependent on temperature @xmath5 at half filling when @xmath6 , while with a finite @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it should be dominated by @xmath7 terms in low energy regime .",
    "these unusual phenomena are direct results of the low energy excitations of graphene , which behave as massless dirac fermions . furthermore",
    ", when @xmath4 is high enough , there is a pronounced crossover which divides the temperature dependence of the nmr relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility into two temperature regimes : the nmr relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility increase dramatically as temperature increases in the low temperature regime , and after the crossover , both decrease as temperature increases at high temperatures .",
    "this crossover is due to the well - known logarithmic van hove singularity in the dos , and its position dependence of temperature is sensitive to @xmath4 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the theoretical framework is introduced in section ii .",
    "our numerical result and discussion are shown in section iii , and the paper is concluded with a summary in section iv .",
    "graphene is a two dimensional crystal of carbon atoms with a honeycomb lattice , which can be described in terms of two interpenetrating triangular sublattices , a and b , and then the electronic structure of graphene can be captured within a tight - binding description@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) annihilates ( creates ) electrons at the site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) on sublattice a , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) annihilates ( creates ) electrons at the site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) on sublattice b. @xmath18 and @xmath2 are the nearest neighbor and next - nearest neighbor hopping energies respectively , and @xmath1 is the chemical potential .",
    "the presence of @xmath2 introduces an asymmetry between the valance and conduction bands , thus violating particle - hole symmetry .",
    "specific values for @xmath18 and @xmath2 have been estimated@xcite by comparing a tight - binding description to first - principle calculations .",
    "following their estimates , we take @xmath192.7ev . to learn more on the effect of @xmath2 in graphene , cases with different values of @xmath2 will be studied , and a typical @xmath200.27 ev will be paid more attention@xcite in the following .    in the sublattice system , there are two coupled sublattices , and the energy spectrum has two branches . in this case , the one - particle green s functions are matrices @xmath21 where the longitudinal and transverse parts are defined as @xmath22with @xmath23 is the imaginary time , and @xmath24 is the @xmath23 order operator .",
    "then the green s functions are obtained as @xmath25 respectively , where @xmath26,\\nonumber \\\\ \\gamma_{k}&=&2[\\cos{\\sqrt{3}k_{x}}+2\\cos{\\frac{3}{2}k_{x}}\\cos{(\\frac{{\\sqrt 3}}{2}k_{y})}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from these , the dos follows as @xmath27 with @xmath28 . for @xmath6 an analytical expression for the dos per unit cell",
    "can be derived@xcite : @xmath29 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\displaystyle{\\frac{2}{\\pi^2 } \\frac{|\\omega|}{t^2 } \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z_0 } } \\mathbf{k}[z(\\omega)]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . with a finite @xmath2 ,",
    "the dos is evaluated by inserting unity in the form of an integral over the dirac delta function as @xmath33 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac 1n\\sum_{k,\\nu}\\delta(1-\\xi(k)^{(\\nu)})\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\frac 12\\sum_{\\lambda=1,2}\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty d\\epsilon \\delta[\\epsilon-(-1)^\\lambda t\\sqrt{3+\\gamma_k}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , by interchanging the integration with @xmath34 summation , we obtain @xmath35\\delta[\\epsilon-(-1)^\\lambda t g_k]\\ ] ] with @xmath36 .",
    "the second delta function enables us to replace @xmath37 by @xmath38 , yielding to @xmath39\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\frac { 1}{2n}\\sum_{k\\lambda}\\delta[\\epsilon-(-1)^\\lambda t g_k]\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\nu}\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{d\\epsilon}{2 } \\delta[\\omega - t'\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{t^2}+3t'-(-1)^{\\nu}\\epsilon]\\rho_0(\\epsilon),\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the dos with @xmath6 , and then @xmath41 } , \\nonumber \\\\ \\widetilde{\\protect\\omega}_{\\nu}&=&{\\frac{t^{2}}{2t^{^{\\prime } } } } [ 1+(-1)^{\\nu}\\protect\\sqrt{% 1 + 4\\frac{t^{\\prime } } { t^{2}}(\\protect\\omega + 3t^{\\prime } ) } ] .",
    "\\protect\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now let us turn to evaluate the nmr relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility . in general , @xmath9 measures the local dynamics of the spins , and it is related to the transverse spin susceptibility @xmath42 , which reads as@xcite @xmath43 and after a straightforward calculation , we obtain @xmath44 with the help of spectral representation , we define @xmath45 which has a relationship with the dos @xmath46 in this representation , we can obtain the nmr relaxation rate finally @xmath47 in which @xmath48 is the bohr magneton , @xmath49 is the electron @xmath49 factor , @xmath50 is the planck constant , and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the boltzman constant .",
    "the @xmath53 are hyperfine form factors , which do not vary much with @xmath34 in general .",
    "so we write all these form factors as @xmath54 , which is independent of temperature . in the similar way , the static spin susceptibility can be derived as @xmath55 and @xmath56 comes from @xmath57    : ( a ) @xmath2=0 ; ( b ) @xmath2=0.27 ev ; ( c ) @xmath2=0.54 ev ; ( d ) @xmath2=0.81 ev with @xmath18=2.7 ev . ]",
    "nmr is a powerful method to characterize correlated states of materials as it is sensitive to the dos near the fermi edge .",
    "so we study the dos firstly , and our results for different values of the next neighbor hoping @xmath2 have been shown in fig.1 . focusing on the particle - hole symmetric case , in fig.1 ( a )",
    ", it is clear that , besides the linear vanishing of the dos at the fermi level , there are marked van  hove singularities at the hopping energy , @xmath58 . with a finite @xmath2 ,",
    "as shown in fig.1 ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) , these van  hove singularities shall appear at @xmath59 , which is derived from eq .",
    "12 , and we will show that @xmath2 plays an important role in graphene as it breaks the particle - hole symmetry .    for both @xmath6 and @xmath60 cases , the dos in graphene is markedly different from that in normal metals@xcite as its low energy excitations are two - dimensional massless dirac fermions@xcite , and the presence of @xmath2 shifts in energy the position of the dirac point and breaks particle - hole symmetry .",
    "our further results shall indicate that these kinds of important features of the dos are at the origin of interesting properties of the nmr relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility in graphene , as well as many transport anomalies in this material@xcite .",
    "having been familiar with the main features of the dos in graphene , we now turn to the evaluation of the nmr relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility . in fig.2 ( a ) and ( b ) , the nmr relaxation rate and the static spin susceptibility as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath18=2.7 ev",
