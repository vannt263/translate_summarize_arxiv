    "spin foam models provide a well defined framework for background independent diffeomorphism invariant quantum field theory . a surprising great deal of approaches have led to this type of models@xcite . in particular , due to their non perturbative features , spin foam models appear as a very attractive framework for quantum gravity .",
    "spin foam models provide a rigorous implementation of the wheeler - misner - hawking@xcite sum over geometries formulation of quantum gravity .",
    "the 4-geometries summed over are represented by foam - like structures known as spin foams .",
    "they are defined as colored 2-complexes .",
    "a 2-complex @xmath0 is a ( combinatorial ) set of elements called `` vertices '' @xmath1 , `` edges '' @xmath2 and `` faces '' @xmath3 , and a boundary relation among these , such that an edge is bounded by two vertices , and a face is bounded by a cyclic sequence of contiguous edges ( edges sharing a vertex ) .",
    "a spin foam is a 2-complex plus a `` coloring '' @xmath4 , that is an assignment of an irreducible representation @xmath5 of a given group @xmath6 to each face @xmath3 and of an intertwiner @xmath7 to each edge @xmath2 .",
    "the model is defined by the partition function @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 correspond to the amplitude associated to faces , edges , and vertices respectively ( they are given functions of the corresponding colors ) .",
    "@xmath12 is a normalization factor for each 2-complex .",
    "spin foam models related to gravity have been obtained as modifications of topological quantum field theories ( corresponding to bf theory ) by implementation of the constraints that reduce bf theory to general relativity@xcite .",
    "so far , these constructions were restricted to the euclidean sector",
    ". a crucial step towards the definition of a physical lorentzian model has been taken by barrett and crane in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "barrett and crane construct a well defined vertex amplitude for lorentzian quantum gravity , based on the representation theory of @xmath13 .",
    "based on the work of barrett and crane , in this letter we complete the definition of a lorentzian spin foam model for gravity .",
    "that is , we give an explicitly formula for the partition function of the model .",
    "to this aim , we use the technology provided by field theory over group manifolds , developed in in @xcite . in this language ,",
    "spin foams ( quantum 4-geometries ) appear as the feynman diagrams of a certain nonlocal scalar field theory over a group .",
    "strikingly , the barrett - crane lorentzian vertex appears completely naturally in this context .",
    "two important points should be emphasized .",
    "first , the theory defined in this way implements automatically the sum over 2-complexes @xmath0 in ( [ z ] ) , and in particular , fixes the @xmath12 value .",
    "this sum is necessary to restore full general covariance of a theory with local degrees of freedom such as gr @xcite . indeed , in the case of a topological field theory @xcite the sum over 2-complexes in ( [ z ] )",
    "can be dropped ( for fixed topology ) due to the triangulation invariance of the partition function .",
    "this is a consequence of the absence of local degrees of freedom in the topological theory .",
    "when the constraints are implemented , however , the theory acquires the local degrees of freedom of gravity and different 2-complexes carry physical information . in the language of standard qft ,",
    "they represent higher order radiative corrections . in our model , the sum over 2-complexes is automatically implemented by the formalism .",
    "the second point is about divergences . the euclidean model in @xcite",
    "is defined in terms of a quantum deformation of the gauge group ( @xmath14 , with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the quantum deformation is needed to regularize divergences in ( [ z ] ) . in the limit in which the quantum deformation is removed ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "these divergences appear whenever the 2-complex @xmath0 includes bubbles @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , using the field theory over group technology , we have defined a variant of the model , in which the basic bubble amplitudes are finite for @xmath17 .",
    "the definition of the lorentzian model presented here corresponds to this variant .",
    "although further study is certainly needed , we suspect that the lorentzian model presented here might be finite even with @xmath17",
    ".    many issues remain open . in particular : ( i ) can we get stronger evidence that the model gives general relativity in the classical limit ?",
    "( ii ) can finiteness be proven ?",
    "( iii ) what is the physical meaning and the physical regime of validity of the expansion in the number of vertices ?",
    "( iv ) do the transition amplitudes of the model have a direct physical interpretation ?",
    "if answers to these questions turned out to be positive , the model presented here might provide an interesting candidate for a quantum theory of gravity .    in the bulk of the paper",
    "we introduce the new model and discuss its properties . in an appendix we present a compendium of known results on harmonic analysis and representation theory of @xmath13 on which our construction is based .",
    "we start with a field @xmath18 over @xmath19 . we assume the field has compact support and is symmetric under arbitrary permutations of its arguments to appear in the feynman expansion@xcite . ] .",
    "we define the projectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath22 and @xmath23 where @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 denote the corresponding invariant measures .",
    "we define the action of our model as @xmath28=\\int dg_i \\left [ p_{\\gamma } \\phi(g_i ) \\right]^2 + { \\lambda \\over 5 ! } \\int dg_i \\left [ p_{\\gamma } p_{u}\\phi(g_i ) \\right]^5,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 denotes @xmath18 , and the fifth power in the interaction term is notation for @xmath31 ^ 5:=\\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4)\\   \\phi(g_4,g_5,g_6,g_7)\\ \\phi(g_7,g_3,g_8,g_9)\\   \\phi(g_9,g_6,g_2,g_{10 } ) \\ \\phi(g_{10},g_8,g_5,g_1).\\ ] ] the @xmath32 integration projects the field into the space of gauge invariant fields , namely , those such that @xmath33 for @xmath34 . ) is proportional to the trivial diverging factor @xmath35 .",
    "this divergence could be fixed easily , for instance by gauge fixing and just dropping one of the group integrations . for the clarity of the presentation",
    ", however , we have preferred to keep gauge invariance manifest , use the action formally to generate the feynman expansion , and drop the redundant group integration whenever needed.[foot ] ] the vertex and propagator of the theory are simply given by a set of delta functions on the group , as illustrated in @xcite , to which we refer for details .",
    "feynman diagrams correspond to arbitrary 2-complex @xmath0 with 4-valent edges ( bounding four faces ) , and 5-valent vertices ( bounding five edges ) .",
    "once the configuration variables @xmath36 are integrated over , the feynman amplitudes reduce to integrals over the group variables @xmath32 and @xmath37 in the proyectors in ( [ action ] ) . these end up combined as arguments of one delta functions per face @xcite .",
    "that is , a straightforward computation yields @xmath38 in this equation , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 come from the group integration in the projectors @xmath20 in the two vertices bounding the edge @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath41 comes from the projector @xmath20 in the propagator defining the edge @xmath2 .",
    "finally , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the @xmath44 integration variables in the projector @xmath45 in the two vertices .",
    "notice that each @xmath37 integration variable appear only once in the integrand , while each @xmath32 integration variable appears in four different delta s ( each edge bounds four faces ) .",
    "the index @xmath4 denotes the number of edges of the corresponding face .",
    "now we use equation ( [ vani ] ) to expand the delta functions in terms of irreducible representations of @xmath13 .",
    "only the representations @xmath46 in the principal series contribute to this expansion .",
    "we obtain @xmath47.\\ ] ] next , we rewrite this equation in terms of the matrix elemets @xmath48 of the representation @xmath46 in the canonical basis , defined in the appendix .",

    "the generators of the simple representations satisfy precisely the bf to gr constraint .",
    "namely @xmath53 has the appropriate @xmath54 form @xcite .",
    "notice however that the representations @xmath52 are not the only simple representations ; there are also simple representations of the form @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the two sets have a simple geometrical interpretation in terms of space and time like directions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we suspect that to recover full gr both set of simple representations should be included . ]",
    "that is , after the integration over @xmath42 , the matrix @xmath57 collapses to @xmath58 .",
    "one of these two kroeneker deltas appears always contracted with the indices of the @xmath59 associated to a vertex ; while the other is contracted with a propagator .",
    "we observe that the representation matrices associated to propagators ( @xmath60 ) appear in four faces in ( [ aj ] ) .",
    "the ones associated to vertices appear also four times but combined in the ten corresponding faces converging at a vertex .",
    "consequently , they can be paired according to the rule @xmath61 . in fig.([figure ] ) we represent the structure described above .",
    "a continuous line represents a representation matrix , while a dark dot a contraction with a projector ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "taking all this into account , we have    [ vertex ]    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is given by @xmath65 and @xmath66 by @xmath67 in fig.([figure ] ) , each @xmath68 in the previous expressions corresponds to a line bounded by two dark dots .",
    "the functions @xmath68 are known explicitly in the literature@xcite ; they can be realized as functions on the hyperboloid ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70 , @xmath71 in minkowski spacetime in the following way .",

    "it is easy to see that the parameter @xmath76 associated to @xmath32 corresponds to the hyperbolic distance from the point @xmath81 to the apex of the hyperboloid ( boost parameter ) .",
    "the hyperboloid is a transitive surface under the action of @xmath13 , i.e. , it is lorentz invariant .",

    "equivalently , it corresponds to the hyperbolic distance between @xmath86 and the lorentz transformed apex @xmath87(namely , @xmath88 ) .",
    "we define @xmath89 finally , the invariant measure on @xmath13 is simply the product of the invariant measures of the hyperboloid and @xmath44 , that is @xmath90 . using all this , the vertex and edge amplitudes can be expressed in simple form .",
    "the edge amplitude ( [ edge ] ) becomes @xmath91 where we have dropped the @xmath92 s from our previous notation , since now they all take the value zero .",
    "this expression is finite , and its explicit value is computed in @xcite .",
    "finally , the vertex amplitude ( [ choclo ] ) results @xmath93 we can now remove the trivial divergence ( the integration over the gauge group ) by dropping one of the group integrations ( see footnote [ foot ] above ) .",
    "the vertex amplitude ( [ vv ] ) is precisely the one defined by barrett and crane in @xcite .",
    "the spin foam model is finally given by @xmath94 it corresponds to the lorentzian generalization to the one defined in @xcite .",
    "we have carried over the generalization of the model defined in @xcite to the lorentzian signature .",
    "the model is given by an @xmath13 bf quantum theory plus a quantum implementation of the additional constraints that reduce bf theory to lorentzian general relativity .",
    "the analog model in the euclidean @xmath95 case was shown to be finite up to first bubble corrections .",
    "it would be very interesting to study this issue in the lorentzian case .",
    "evidence in favor of the conjecture of finiteness comes from the fact that , as in the euclidean case , the edge contribution in the model tends to regularize the amplitudes .",
    "divergences appear when compatibility conditions at edges fail to prevent colors associated to faces to get arbitrarily large .",
    "this happens when there are close surfaces in the spin foam , namely , bubbles . in @xcite",
    "this divergences were cured by the dumping effect of edge amplitudes . as in its euclidean relative , in the lorentzian model presented here",
    "the edge amplitude goes to zero for large values of the colors .",
    "more precisely , the amplitude ( [ eee ] ) behaves like @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "the state sum contains only representations of the form @xmath52 .",
    "these correspond to the simple irreducible representations representing space - like directions@xcite . to obtain full general relativity",
    ", it might be necessary to generalize the present construction to include the others simple representations ; that is , those of the form @xmath98 , with @xmath92 an arbitrary integer , which correspond to time - like directions .",
    "a simple modification of the action ( [ action ] ) should allow these other balanced representation to be included .",
    "these important issues will be investigated in the future .",
