    "we have measured the rate of autoionized @xmath69na@xmath10 dimers as a function of the trapped atomic population : this measures the relative cold molecular population of the mot as a function of atomic population , since the formation rate of autoionized dimers must be related to the formation rate of cold , ground state , trapped dimers .",

    "the amplitude of the corrected background spectrum is determined by fitting the trap - on beta decay tof spectrum in regions away from the recoil ion and molecular peaks .",
    "the amplitude of the background term is then fixed in the fits to the recoil - ion tof spectrum .",
    "another issue in subtracting a background tof spectrum is the contribution from events caused by the coincident detection of a @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 ) with the electron mcp and a positively charged recoil @xmath1ne ion .",

    "the @xmath91 ( or @xmath92 ) triggered events select a direction for the @xmath91 momentum , favoring recoil ions with a preferred momentum direction towards the ion mcp , which would give a distorted measurement of @xmath9 in the shakeoff - triggered tof spectrum .",
