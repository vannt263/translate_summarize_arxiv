    "the x - ray emission could correspond to either inverse compton emission of the low - energy electrons involving cmb target photon field (  ic / cmb  model ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , or an additional synchrotron component due to a higher - energy electron population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "overall , the broad - band spectral indices appear consistent with the ( 1+@xmath0)@xmath76 amplification of the cmb energy density ,  @xmath77 ( with the doppler factor , @xmath78 , the bulk lorentz factor , @xmath79 , and the cmb and magnetic field energy densities in the jet rest frame , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ) , as would be expected in the ic / cmb model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and the knot diameter is @xmath88 smaller than the assumed 1  limit , we obtain @xmath89 @xmath54 g and @xmath90 .",
    "these estimates assume a single x - ray / radio emitting zone applies to our @xmath21 ( 6.6 kpc ) angular resolution element .    similarly applying the ic / cmb model to the other high - redshift x - ray jet , gb  1508 + 4714 ( @xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . although the number of quasar x - ray jets found at such very high - redshifts ( @xmath93 ) is still small , the slower large - scale jets implied in our analysis for the current sample seem to indicate that they are either : ( 1 ) intrinsically less relativistic , or ( 2 ) decelerate more rapidly out to @xmath1 10 s @xmath94 100 s kpc - scales than their lower - redshift counterparts . in the first case",
    ", this would be consistent with the recent finding that the relative abundance of high - power blazars relative to the parent population of radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies decreased substantially above @xmath95 , likely as a result of a decrease of the average bulk lorentz factor of blazar jets in the early universe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the latter possibility could be supported by the fact that the environments of high - redshift ( @xmath96 ) radio sources are believed to reside in more inhomogeneous and multi - phase environments than in nearby radio sources ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this may manifest in the slower large - scale jets due to an enhanced entrainment of the ambient gas when the jet propagates through the host galaxy .",
    "an argument put forth against the ic / cmb model comes from observations of the unresolved ( at  resolution ) quasar `` cores '' at high - redshift . in this interpretation for the kpc - scale emission",
    ", one may expect that the x - ray emission in these cores could also be enhanced , as they contain an unresolved portion of the jet ( which we know are highly relativistic from , e.g. , vlbi superluminal motion studies ) . this could manifest in different x - ray core properties at high-@xmath0 ( x - ray , and optical - to - x - ray spectra ) , but  studies thus far show no such trends with redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , these analyses are hampered by the fact that most of the sources analyzed so far in this context are only moderately radio - loud , and in general , only a small fraction of jets in radio - loud quasars extend to kpc - scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio structures of higher - redshift samples are now being investigated in more detail ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gobeille et al . , in preparation ) , and will pave the way for further  x - ray studies .",
    "x - ray observations of a larger sample of kpc - scale radio jets over a broad redshift range ( @xmath97 ) should provide further elucidation of the correct x - ray emission mechanism which will give us insight on the deeper physics contained in the data .",
    "such high redshift systems allow us to study jets which result from the `` earliest '' actively accreting black hole systems .",
