    "as realized firstly by derishev , kocharovsky @xmath5 kocharovsky ( 1999a ) , the fireball of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may contain a significant neutron component in several progenitor scenarios .",
    "for the neutron - rich fireball , the acceleration will be modified ( bachall & mszros 2000 , hereafter bm00 ) and there could be many novel observational signatures : ( 1 ) if the neutron abundance is comparable to that of proton , the inelastic collision between differentially streaming protons and neutrons in the fireball will provide us observable 5 - 10 gev neutrinos / photons ( derishev et al . 1999a ; bm00 ; mszros & rees 2000 ; koers & giannios 2007 ) ; ( 2 ) the very early afterglow emission of grbs would be modified significantly because of the @xmath6decay ( @xmath7 ) of the  fast \" neutrons carried in the outflow ( derishev et al .",
    "1999b ; pruet @xmath5 dalal 2002 ; beloborodov 2003b ; fan , zhang & wei 2005b ) ; ( 3 ) in the neutron - rich internal shock model , for grbs with a duration @xmath8 s , the @xmath6decay products of the earlier  slow \" neutrons with a typical lorentz factor ( lf ) @xmath9 tens will interact with the ion shell ejected at later times and give rise to detectable uv / optical flashes ( fan & wei 2004 ; fan , zhang & wei 2005a ) ; ( 4 ) as shown in vlahakis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , for a magnetized neutron - rich outflow , the neutrons can decouple from the protons at a lf @xmath10 in the tens , while protons , which are collimated to a narrower angle by the electromagnetic force , continue to be accelerated to a value of @xmath10 in the hundreds . as a result , a two - component jet might be formed ( vlahakis et al .",
    "2003 ; peng et al .",
    "jin et al . ( 2007 ) claimed that the x - ray flat segment of short grb 051221 was attributed to such a scenario .",
    "( 5 ) razzaque & mszros ( 2006 ) calculated the synchrotron radiation of the electrons resulting in the @xmath6decay and found unique temporal and spectral signature .    in this work , we show that in the neutron - rich ( unmagnetized ) internal shock model , besides the possible uv / optical flashes predicted in fan & wei ( 2004 ) , there could be strong gev emission .",
    "this high energy radiation component is a result of the inverse compton cooling of the electrons due to the spacetime overlapping between the prompt soft @xmath11-ray photon flow and the interaction region between the proton shell and decay products of the neutron shell .",
    "such a cooling process , suppressing the uv / optical emission significantly , has been taken into account by fan et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "these authors , however , did not calculate the possible gev emission .",
    "in the standard baryonic fireball model , the prompt emission of long grbs are likely to be powered by the violent collision of shells with different lfs ( paczyski & xu 1994 ; rees & mszros 1994 ) . until now",
    ", the practical lf distribution of shells in neutron - free internal shocks model is unknown , let alone the case of neutron - rich . to reach a high efficiency of radiation , significant difference of lfs between two shells with approximately the same mass ( @xmath12 )",
    "are favored ( piran 1999 ) .",
    "the unmagnetized outflow is controlled by the dimensionless entropy @xmath13 at @xmath14 , where @xmath15 being the total luminosity of the ejecta and @xmath14 being the radius of the central engine .",
    "the decoupling of protons and neutrons in a fireball occurs in the coasting or accelerating regime , depending on whether @xmath16 is below or above the critical value @xmath17^{-1/4}$ ] , @xmath18 being the ratio of number density of neutrons to protons ( bm00 ) .",
    "the convention @xmath19 has been adopted in this letter , in units of cgs .",
    "if a slow shell is concerned with @xmath20 , neutrons are coupled with protons until the end of the acceleration episode .",
    "however , for a fast shell , were derived ( e.g. , zhang et al . 2006 ; molinari et al .",
    "2007 ) . for @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 .",
    "so the assumption @xmath23 is reasonable . ]",
    "@xmath24 , neutrons decouple from protons , keeping the velocity at that time , while protons can be accelerated to higher velocity . as a result ,",
    "@xmath25 for slow shells and @xmath26 for fast shells , where the subscripts @xmath27 , @xmath28 represent the proton /neutron component ; @xmath29 represent the fast / slow shells respectively ( bm00 ) .",
    "so far we have four kinds of shells , i.e. , slow neutron / ion shells and fast neutron / ion shells .",
    "similar to the standard neutron - free fireball , the fast ion shell will catch up with the slower but earlier one and forms a new one moving with a lf @xmath30 at a radius @xmath31 , suppose that the ejection time - lag between these two shells is about 0.01s ( hereafter the formed `` new '' shell is named as the `` i - shell '' ) . the @xmath0-decay radius of a neutron shell ( hereafter , the ",
    "n - shell \" ) reads as @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , so the @xmath6decay of these fast neutrons wo nt influence the physical process taking place at @xmath35 significantly .",
    "however , the much later ejected i - shell will catch up the earlier slow n - shell at a radius @xmath36 , where @xmath37 being the ejection time - lag between the earlier slow n - shell and the later i - shell and @xmath38 being the redshift of grb . as long as @xmath39 is comparable with @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41 the decay - product of earlier ejected but slower neutron shells will be swept orderly by the later ejected ion shells in a range @xmath42 and interesting uv / optical and gev emission are produced .    in this letter , following fan & wei ( 2004 ) , we assume : ( 1 ) the lf of shells has bimodal distribution , @xmath43 or @xmath44 with equal probability , which is favored by its relatively high efficiency of energy conversion and high peak energy of the internal shock emission ( guetta , spada & waxman 2001 ) .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath45 . as a result ,",
    "the ratios between the mass of the fast neutrons , slow neutrons and i - shells are @xmath46 .",
    "( 3 ) proton and neutron shells move with lf @xmath47 for fast shells and @xmath48 for slow shells . after the merger of a pair of fast / slow ion shells , the resulting i - shell moves with @xcite @xmath49 ( 4 ) the ejecta expands into low density interstellar medium ( ism ) , as mostly found in afterglow modeling ( panaitescu @xmath5 kumar 2002 ) .",
    "the ism has been swept by the early and fast ions as well as the decayed products of fast neutrons , so the decay products of slow neutrons move freely .",
    "notice that in front of the i - shells ejected at a time @xmath50 sec , there are hundreds of decaying n - shells . with assumptions made before , the whole process of each i",
    "- shell interacting with these decaying n - shells is rather similar . for convenience , in our following treatment ,",
    "the discrete interaction of each i - shell with these decaying n - shells has been simplified as the situation of an i - shell sweeping a moving proton trail ( the lf of which is @xmath51 ) with a number density ( fan & wei 2004 ) @xmath52 continually , where @xmath53 is the rest mass of protons and @xmath54 is the mass of the decaying / slow neutron shell .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the i - shell is governed by the energy conservation of the system and can be estimated as ( fan & wei 2004 ) : @xmath55 where @xmath11 represents the lorentz factor of the decreasing i - shell and @xmath56 indicates the lf of the i - shell relative to the n - shell . in the adiabatic situation , the radiation efficiency factor @xmath57",
    "is assumed as zero .",
    "@xmath58 is the thermal energy in the comoving frame .",
    "the swept mass satisfies @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 are the corresponding velocity of @xmath11 and @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig : dyn ] ) . here , the luminosity of the prompt @xmath11-ray emission is taken as @xmath63 .",
    "the rapid increase of @xmath64 is due to the exponential decline of the mass of the decay product of the neutron shell .",
    "note that the upper thick line is the result assuming a series of parameters as in section 2.2 , while the lower one is for the same parameters except @xmath65 .",
    "the solid line indicates the dynamical evolution of the i - shell ( @xmath11 ) , while the dotted and dashed - dotted line represent the minimum lf of accelerated electrons ( @xmath66 ) and the cooling lorentz factor ( @xmath67 ) , respectively.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the numerical calculation , we take the following parameters : the mass of i - shell and n - shell @xmath68 g , the initial lf of i - shell @xmath69 , the lf of n - shell @xmath70=30 , and the width of n - shell is taken to be @xmath71 cm . @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the fraction of shock energy given to the electrons and magnetic field ,",
    "are taken as 0.3 and 0.01 , respectively .",
    "the minimum lf of the shocked electrons is estimated as @xmath74 where @xmath75 being the rest mass of electrons and @xmath27 being the power - law index of the distribution of accelerated electrons .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig.[fig : dyn ] .",
    "the electrons lose their energy via synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering on the soft @xmath4ray photons with a luminosity @xmath76 .",
    "the inverse compton is usually in the thompson regime because @xmath77 , where @xmath78 kev is the typical peak energy of grbs ( preece et al .",
    "so the inverse compton parameter can be estimated by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the numerical estimate of @xmath82 has been presented in fig.[fig : dyn ] .",
    "one can see that the cooling of electrons is dominated by the inverse compton process .",
    "now the seed photons are from a region separated from the scattering electrons and along the direction in which the ejecta moves .",
    "following fan & piran ( 2008 ) , we call this kind of inverse compton scattering as the external inverse compton ( eic ) .",
    "the corresponding synchrotron self - compton parameter @xmath83 can be estimated as follows .",
    "following sari & esin ( 2001 ) , in the case of fast cooling ( see below for the reason ) , we have @xmath84 which gives ( see also fan & piran 2006 ) @xmath85 from fig.[fig : dyn ] , * we see that @xmath86 * in most cases , so the eic emission always dominates the ssc emission .",
    "the cooling lorentz factor @xmath87 of the electrons can be estimated as ( piran 1999 ) @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the observer s timescale , @xmath90 is the thomson cross section , and b is the comoving downstream magnetic field @xmath91 .    as shown in fig.[fig : dyn ] , @xmath92 .",
    "the electrons are in the fast cooling regime .",
    "the electrons accelerated in the interaction between i - shell and the decay product of n - shells will subsequently compton scatter the prompt soft @xmath4ray photons , and boost them to an energy @xmath93    the total energy of the gev emission can be estimated as follows .",
    "note that in our simplest model , the energy released in an i - shell interacting with the @xmath6decay products of a series of neutron shells is equivalent to that of the interaction between an ion - shell and all the decay products of a neutron shell .",
    "so the gev emission is largely the same as that resulting in the internal shocks at @xmath94 powered by two ion - shells .",
    "following piran ( 1999 ) , we consider a collision between these two shells with mass @xmath95 and @xmath96 which are moving with different lfs : @xmath97 . here , the same parameters are taken as in section 2.2 .",
    "the resulting bulk lf @xmath98 in an elastic collision is @xmath99 the total internal energy ( the difference of the kinetic energies before and after the collision ) is @xmath100 then the total energy given to electrons : @xmath101    since the electrons are in the fast cooling regime , the gev radiation efficiency can be estimated as ( for @xmath102 ) @xmath103 with the typical parameters adopted in this work , we get @xmath104 . this is comparable to the typical grb efficiency @xmath105 ( guetta , spada & waxman 2001 ) .",
    "we thus draw the conclusion that the total energy of our gev radiation component is comparable to the total energy of the soft @xmath4ray photons in some very long grbs .",
    "the eic photons may be absorbed due to pair production by photons with energy above @xmath106 . and",
    "the corresponding optical depth can be estimated as ( e.g. , svensson 1987 ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the total number of photons of the prompt emission satisfying @xmath109 , @xmath110 is the timescale of the late prompt emission overlapping with eic emission and its power - law index @xmath111 has been used to get the analytical coefficient .",
    "the ultimate optical depth is @xmath112 and the spectrum around 5 gev would not suffer a significant absorption .",
    "now we estimate the detectability of this gev component by the upcoming satellite glast . the large area telescope on board covers the energy range from 20 mev to 300 gev .",
    "the effective area around 1 gev is @xmath113 .",
    "so the expected number of the gev photons is @xmath114 usually at least 5 high energy photos are needed to claim a detection ( e.g. , zhang & mszaros 2001 ) , so we conclude that this component is detectable for some bright long grbs .",
    "please see fig.[fig : spectrum ] for a numerical example , which shows @xmath115 below the peak as a result of the scattering electrons in the fast cooling phase .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ]    -ray emission upscattered by electrons in the neutron - rich internal shocks model .",
    "glast sensitivity with corresponding exposure time is also labelled as the dashed line ( galli & guetta 2008 ) . ]",
    "the physical composition of grb outflows is not clear yet . the outflows , in principle ,",
    "could be poynting - flux dominated or neutron - rich .",
    "people found some evidences for either model .",
    "for example , the modeling of optical flashes in some grbs suggested the magnetization of the reverse shock regions and favored the hypothesis that these grb outflows were at least weakly magnetized , while the delayed / prompt optical flares detected in grb 041219a and some other afterglow modeling got some indication evidences for neutron - rich outflows ( see zhang 2007 for a review ) . the physical composition of grb outflows may be not universal and more effects are needed to get some  unique \" signatures of the poynting - flux dominated or neutron - rich ejecta . in this work",
    ", we calculate the possible gev emission signature of the unmagnetized neutron - rich internal shocks .",
    "this high energy component , only emerging in some very long grbs , is accompanying some uv / optical flares ( fan & wei 2004 ) and is expected to be correlated with the prompt @xmath11-ray emission but to have a @xmath116 s lag .",
    "this is very different from li & waxman ( 2008 ) , in which the uv / optical / gev flares are powered by a series of weaker and weaker internal shocks at a distance @xmath117 cm and are almost simultaneous with the prompt @xmath4rays without an obvious lag .",
    "the time delay of the eic emission , caused by the anisotropic emission of the scattered photons in the rest frame of the shocked medium ( see fan & piran 2008 for a recent review ) , @xmath118 , is also ignorable in the case we consider .    in some very long bright grbs",
    ", the delayed gev emission discussed in this work is energetic enough to be detectable for the upcoming glast satellite ( see section 2.3 for details ) .",
    "it , however , might be outshined by the synchrotron - self compton ( ssc ) radiation of the regular internal shocks at a radius @xmath119 cm .",
    "so only for the regular internal shocks having @xmath120 , the delayed gev emission may be the dominant signal .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig : dyn ] , for @xmath121 , @xmath122 at @xmath123 .",
    "so most of the energy generated at a radius @xmath124 is lost into the eic gev emission . for gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ; @xmath125 mev ) onboard glast , the field of view is all sky not occulted by the earth and that of the large - area telescope ( lat ; @xmath126 ) is @xmath127 sr .",
    "so @xmath128 grbs will be detected by gbm and lat simultaneously . with a good quality of kev@xmath12910 gev spectrum",
