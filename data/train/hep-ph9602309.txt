    "the study of exclusive semileptonic decays of heavy mesons has attracted much interest in recent years .",
    "semileptonic decays of heavy mesons to heavy mesons , such as @xmath8 , provide an ideal testing ground for heavy - quark symmetry and heavy - quark effective theory . by comparison ,",
    "weak decays of heavy mesons to light mesons are much more complicated theoretically , since in general there exists no symmetry principle for guidance .",
    "nevertheless , it is essential to understand the reaction mechanisms of these decay modes , because they are the main sources of information on the ckm mixing matrix elements between heavy and light quarks . in particular , the study of the @xmath9 decay is important for the determination of matrix element @xmath10 whose value is only poorly known@xcite .",
    "recently , the @xmath11 decay has been investigated by many groups @xcite using various different approaches , such as quark models , qcd sum rules , heavy - quark symmetry , perturbative qcd , and so on . in most studies ,",
    "transition form factors are calculated only at one kinematic point , @xmath12 , so that extra assumptions are needed to extrapolate the form factors to cover the entire range of momentum transfer . in @xcite",
    "chiral perturbation is employed , so that the results are valid for soft pion emission only . in @xcite perturbative qcd",
    "is applied , in conjunction with hadronic wave functions obtained from qcd sum rule , to calculate the decay amplitudes ; therefore the result is valid only when the final pion is energetic .    in this study , we first calculate the @xmath9 decay form factors using relativistic light - front hadronic wave functions [ fig .",
    "the parameters in these wave functions are determined from other informations , and melosh transformation is used to construct meson states of definite spins .",
    "although light - front wave functions and quark model in the infinite momentum frame have been used in the past to study @xmath11 decay and other heavy - light transitions@xcite , the decay form factors were only calculated for @xmath13 . in this work ,",
    "we directly evaluate for the first time the form factors in the entire kinematic region , so that additional extrapolation assumptions are no longer required .",
    "secondly , we note that the @xmath14 transition involves time - like momentum transfers .",
    "that means @xmath15 in the light - front coordinate , so that one must also consider the effects of the so - called nondiagonal light - front diagrams ( or z - graphs)@xcite , as depicted in fig .",
    "these contributions are generated by the quark - antiquark ( @xmath16 ) excitation or higher fock - states in the hadronic bound states .",
    "we shall effectively represent the @xmath16- configuration of the @xmath1-meson by the mesonic @xmath3 state , giving rise to the @xmath17-pole contribution shown in fig .",
    "it was first noted by isgur and wise@xcite that the @xmath17-pole effect is important in the zero - recoil region .",
    "previous investigations either simply added this effect to the valence - quark contribution@xcite , or totally ignored it . in our more unified approach ,",
    "the @xmath17-pole contribution arises from the @xmath3-component of the @xmath1-meson bound state .",
    "the mixing of different fock - state configurations naturally requires a consistent wave function renormalization which has not been mentioned in all the previous works .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii , the basic theoretical formalism is given . in section iii ,",
    "numerical results are present and discussed , and finally a summary is given in section iv .",
    "the weak current that is responsible for @xmath18-quark decay is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 stands for a light quark .",
    "for @xmath0 , only the vector current contributes , and our main task is to evaluate the hadronic matrix element , @xmath21 , which can be parametrized as @xmath22    in the previous calculations of hadronic matrix elements in the infinite momentum frame or with light - front wave functions , one usually set @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to @xmath24 , implying a space - like momentum transfer . however , momentum transfers in real decay processes are always time - like .",
    "hence matrix elements calculated with @xmath25 is relevant only at the maximum - recoil point with @xmath13 , and one needs an extrapolation ansatz to extend the result to other physical momentum transfers . a direct calculation of the form factors for",
    "the whole momentum transfer range has not been performed . in this work ,",
    "we work in a frame where the  @xmath26\"- components of @xmath27 and @xmath28 vanish , so that @xmath29 , and we can evaluate the form factors in the entire physical range of momentum transfer . as mentioned earlier , in a frame with @xmath30 , there are two distinct contributions to the matrix element .",

    "as we have discussed , for time - like momentum transfers , one must also consider the effects of higher fock - states corresponding to configurations containing quark - antiquark pairs in addition to the valence particles .",
    "such contributions are shown in fig .",
    "unfortunately these higher - fork - state wave functions are not available , and we shall estimate their contributions in an effective mesonic picture . in the case of the @xmath1-meson , it is expected that the effective higher - fock - state configuration @xmath121 is the most important if the relative momentum is small .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath17 masses are almost degenerate due to heavy - quark symmetry , and also the pion mass is small .",
    "consequently , when the relative momentum is small , the @xmath3 configuration is close to the energy shell ( i.e. , the energy denominator is small ) , and is thus enhanced .",
    "this can be readily seen in eq.([wf ] ) , where the interaction hamiltonian @xmath34 describing the @xmath35 coupling is given in chiral perturbative theory by@xcite @xmath122 with @xmath123 = 93 mev being the pion decay constant .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath46 are functions of @xmath7 because @xmath131    however the above results are not quite complete , because chiral perturbation theory is a low - energy effective theory , such that the chiral @xmath35-vertex given in eq .",
    "( [ hi ] ) is valid only for soft pions .",
    "a suppression factor is generally expected when the pion momentum increases .",
    "this can also be understood in the quark picture by the following reasoning .",
    "the higher fock - state @xmath3 arises from quark - pair creation which is a predominently soft process .",
    "first of all , there is not much probability for producing hard @xmath132 pairs .",
    "moreover , once produced , a hard @xmath133 has little chance of forming a pion with a slow @xmath134 , likewise a hard @xmath135 is not likely to form a @xmath17-meson with a slow @xmath18 quark .",
    "therefore configurations with a high - momentum pion in @xmath3 is expected to be suppressed .",
    "this physical requirement can be implemented phenomenologically by introducing a damping form factor , @xmath136 , to the chiral @xmath35-vertex , such that , @xmath137 we shall take @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the 4-velocity of the @xmath1-meson , and @xmath140 is the cutoff momentum which is expected to be of the order of the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath141 gev .",

    "the value of the form factor at @xmath13 is however increased by 20% to @xmath157    it is a common practice in the literature to extrapolate @xmath6 away from the @xmath13 point by a monopole @xmath7-dependence , even though such a @xmath7-dependence is expected to be reasonable only near the zero - recoil point [ @xmath158 .",
    "our result does not confirm such a @xmath7-dependence .",

    "( 2 ) , we see that , near the zero - recoil point , the valence - quark prediction decreases as @xmath7 increases , and no longer bears any resemblence to eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) .",
    "the dipping of the valence - quark contribution toward the zero - recoil point can be understood as follows .",
    "recall that the decay amplitude involves an overlapping integral of the wave functions of the initial and final mesons .",
    "if both mesons were heavy , then it is obvious that , by heavy - quark symmetry , maximum overlapping must occur at the zero - recoil point .",
    "however , in the present situation , a heavy ( @xmath1 ) and a light meson ( @xmath2 ) are involved , and their internal momentum distributions peak at different values of @xmath79 .",
    "specifically , @xmath163 has a narrow peak near @xmath164 , whereas @xmath165 peaks with a much larger width at @xmath166 .",
    "consequently maximum overlapping of the wave functions actually occurs somewhat away from the zero - recoil kinematics .    to test the sensitivity to the @xmath1-meson wave function used",

    "we find that the result is not changed significantly except in the zero - recoil region , @xmath168 gev@xmath5 .",
    "as we shall see , in the zero - recoil region , the @xmath17-pole contribution dominates , and the valence contribution is relatively not important .",
    "next we consider the @xmath17-pole ( or higher - fock - state ) contribution given by eqs .",

    "we take @xmath169 where the values taken for @xmath170 and the ratio @xmath171 are consistent with qcd sum rule and lattice qcd results@xcite .",

    ". qcd - sum - rule calculations@xcite usually obtain smaller values , namely , @xmath179 .",
    "results from various other approaches tend to fall between these two limits @xcite . in eq .",
    "( [ numval ] ) , we have simply taken the average of the non - relativistic quark model prediction and the lowest of the qcd sum - rule results . the cutoff momentum @xmath140 in eq .",

    "it thus seems that a measurement of @xmath6 near zero - recoil would give a rather good estimate of the @xmath35 coupling constant @xmath172 , which is not obtainable from direct strong decays .",
    "the exclusive @xmath11 decay is studied in this paper . we have calculated two different contributions to the decay process : the valence - quark contribution is calculated using light - front wave functions for mesons , while the @xmath17-pole contribution is evaluated with the help of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "in contrast to previous works using relativistic wave functions , the decay form factors have been calculated directly in the entire range of momentum transfer , so that extrapolation from @xmath13 is no longer required .",
    "furthermore , in a more unified approach , the @xmath17-pole contribution is calculated from the higher - fock - state configuration @xmath3 of the @xmath1-meson wave function .",
