    "as an incidental fact , recall that in either theorem , even without conditions ( 2 ) , the quotient space @xmath2 is necessarily an anr , since by hypothesis @xmath2 is a union of two finite dimensional subsets ( namely , the image of the nondegeneracy set of @xmath3 , and its complement ) , hence @xmath2 is finite dimensional .",

    "the rationale is this .",
    "given @xmath17 as in the first theorem , suppose that for any @xmath18 one can come up with a quotient map @xmath19 , with point - inverses of diameter @xmath20 , such that the composition @xmath21 is approximable by homeomorphisms .",

    "we proceed with the proof .",
    "if the nondegeneracy set of the given map @xmath17 were compact , we would argue as follows .",
    "given @xmath18 , let @xmath23 be a finite cover of the 0-dimension image of nondeg@xmath24 by disjoint open subsets of @xmath2 of diameter @xmath20 . fixing @xmath25 , let @xmath26 be a strictly decreasing sequence of compact , not - necessarily - connected manifold neighborhoods of nondeg@xmath27 in @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 , and such that each component of each @xmath30 is null - homotopic in @xmath31 .",

    "( the @xmath33 can be chosen to be manifolds because without loss @xmath28 is a pl manifold , since each point inverse of @xmath3 , being cellular by say @xcite , has a pl manifold neighborhood . )    to connect the @xmath30 s , we start with @xmath34 , and proceed in increasing order of the @xmath35 s , joining the components of @xmath30 together by tubes in @xmath36 ( let @xmath37 be @xmath38 here ) , to get a compact connected manifold @xmath39 which is null - homotopic in @xmath40",
    ". then let @xmath41 , which is a cell - like set containing nondeg@xmath42 .",
    "we can assume @xmath43 has codemension @xmath12 , because the connecting operation can be done carefully so that , for example , @xmath44 has countably many components , each a locally flatly embedded interval .",
    "let @xmath45 be the quotient space @xmath46 .",
    "then the quotient map @xmath47 serves as the map @xmath48 in the preceding paragraph .    in the general case , when the nondegeneracy set of the given map @xmath11 is not compact , but only @xmath49-compact , one essentially does a countable number of connecting operations as above , first for the 1-nondegeneracy set of @xmath3 , then for the 1/2-nondegeneracy set of @xmath3 , etc . , where the @xmath50-nongeneracy set of @xmath3 is the compact set @xmath51 . but some care , and explanation , is required .",
    "first , a little care is necessary to ensure that the new intervals , which are introduced to connect nontrivial point - inverses of @xmath3 , miss all of the original nontrivial point - inverses .",
    "this is easily done , using the codemension hypothesis .",
    "the second point , requiring explanation , is more fundamental .",
    "one can do the connecting operation on the 1-nondegeneracy set , then on the 1/2-nondegeneracy set the new 1-nondegeneracy set , then on the 1/3-nondegeneracy set the new 1/2-nondegeneracy set , etc . , and this will produce a countable upper semi - continuous decomposition , but it may not be null , since at the second stage one may actually be producing a countable number of new nondegenerate point - inverses of diameter @xmath52 .",
    "one way to get around this is , when working on the 1/2-nondegeneracy set , to allow the finitely many already - constructed new 1-nondegenerate point - inverses to enlarge a little , by connecting to them the 1/2-nondegenerate point - inverses which are sufficiently close .",
    "this way one can arrange to have only finitely many 1/2-nondegenerate point - inverses at the end of the second stage . at the next stage , one again allows an arbitrarily small enlargement of the already constructed 1/2-nondegenerate point - inverses , so as to wind up with only a finite number of 1/3-nondegenerate point - inverses .",
    "since the amount of enlarging is arbitrarily small at each stage , one can arrange in the limit that the nondegenerate point - inverses be cell - like and codemension @xmath12 , as well as countable and null .",
    "the following rigorization of the above proof turns out to be a little bit different in detail , but is the same in spirit , and has the virtue of relative brevity . basically , the idea is to intertwine the choice of the connecting tubes with the choice of the manifold neighborhood sequence .",
    "let @xmath53 be a not - necessarily - connected compact manifold neighborhood of 1-nondeg@xmath24 , so small that each component of @xmath53 @xmath54 lies in the 1-neighborhood of some point - inverse in 1-nondeg@xmath24 , and @xmath55 has image in @xmath2 of diameter @xmath20 ( where @xmath18 is given at the start , as explained earlier ) .",
    "let @xmath56 be a not - necessarily - connected compact manifold neighborhood of 1/2-nondeg@xmath24 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are disjoint and each is a union of components of @xmath59 , so small that each component of @xmath59 @xmath54 lies in the 1/2-neighborhood of some point - inverse in 1/2-nondeg@xmath24 , and @xmath55 has image in @xmath2 of diameter @xmath20 , and so that @xmath60 @xmath57 is a neighborhood of 1-nondeg@xmath24 , @xmath61 each component of @xmath57 lies in , and is null homotopic in , some component of @xmath53 ( but the components of @xmath58 may have no relation to @xmath53 at all ) , and @xmath62 each component of @xmath58 has diameter @xmath63 .",
    "one way to do all of this choosing is first to find a partitioning @xmath3(1/2-nondeg@xmath64 of the image of the 1/2-nondegeneracy set of @xmath3 into two disjoint closed ( 0-dimensional ) subsets @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that 1-nondeg@xmath67 .",
    "then choose in the quotient @xmath2 two disjoint open neighborhoods @xmath68 of @xmath65 and @xmath69 of @xmath66 , so small that the preimages @xmath70 and @xmath71 and their components satisfy conditions @xmath72 above .",
    "now let @xmath57 be any compact manifold neighborhood of 1/2-nondeg@xmath73 in @xmath70 , and likewise choose @xmath58 .",
    "at this time , we tube together the various components of @xmath57 which lie in a common component of @xmath53 ( but the components of @xmath58 ) are not tubed together ) .",
    "we would like these tubes to miss @xmath58 ; a priori that may not be possible , because @xmath58 may disconnect some of the components of @xmath53 .",
    "so what we do is first to choose the various connecting tubes in @xmath74 , so thin and well - positioned that they miss 1/2-nondeg@xmath24 , but possibly may intersect @xmath58 , and then we throw away from @xmath58 a small neighborhood of the intersection of the tubes with @xmath58 , producing a smaller manifold @xmath75 which can take the place of @xmath58 .",
    "finally , let @xmath76 denote the union of @xmath77 and the tubed - together components of @xmath57 .",
    "so @xmath76 has one component for each component of @xmath53 , and one component for each component of @xmath75 .",
    "this process is now repeated , to construct @xmath78 , etc . to save words ,",
    "let it suffice to say that , in order to construct @xmath79 given @xmath80 , the above procedure works word - for - word , after making the substitution @xmath80 for @xmath53 ; @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath58 and likewise for the @xmath85 s and @xmath86 s ; @xmath79 for @xmath76 ; and elsewhere @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "( the very first substitution listed is the single exception to the general theme @xmath91 and @xmath92 . )    as part of the construction , one is obtaining at each stage an correspondence @xmath93 components of @xmath94 components of @xmath79 , such that for any component @xmath95 of @xmath80 , @xmath96 is null - homotopic in @xmath95 .",
    "hence for each @xmath97 is a cell - like set , @xmath98 say , of codemension @xmath12 by the usual additional case .",
    "( this latter claim uses @xmath54 , to conclude that the set @xmath98 minus the 1-demensional connecting intervals in @xmath98 lies in nondeg@xmath24 , hence the codemension @xmath12 ) .",
