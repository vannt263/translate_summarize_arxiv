    "surveys at x - ray energies allow us to obtain a more complete view of the agn population , as they cover a broader range in luminosity and are simultaneously less affected by baises due to obscuration . while optical surveys of quasars , like the sdss or 2df , are used to obtain a large sample of unobscured and high - luminosity sources , it is with x - ray surveys that the obscured low - luminosity population can be well traced . in particular , surveys at hard x - ray energies , 210  kev , are almost free of selection effects up to columns of @xmath12 . in the work of ueda et al .",

    "one of the important conclusions of this paper is the confirmation of a luminosity - dependent density evolution , in the sense that lower luminosity sources peak at lower redshifts , @xmath14 , while only the high luminosity sources are significantly more abundant at @xmath15 , as observed in optical quasar surveys ( e.g. , boyle et al .",

    "these authors reported in general a good agreement between observations and the density inferred from agn relics , suggesting that there is little or no room for further obscured accretion , once compton thick agn are properly accounted for .",
    "a similar conclusion was also obtained by barger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from an independently determination of the luminosity function , thus confirming this result .",
    "below we discuss plausible scenarios for forming these umbhs at low redshift .",
    "there are 2 feasible channels for doing so : ( i ) expect extremely rare umbhs to form from the merging of black holes due to the merging of galaxies via the picture suggested by volonteri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; ( ii ) form from accretion onto high redshift ` seeds ' with perhaps a brief period of super - eddington accretion , the descendants of the smbhs that power the most luminous quasars at @xmath16 as proposed recently by volonteri & rees ( 2005 ) ; begelman , volonteri & rees ( 2006 ) ; lodato & natarajan ( 2007 ) and volonteri , lodato & natarajan ( 2007 ) .",
    "we discuss these two possible channels for growing umbhs in more detail below .      following the merging dm hierarchy of halos starting with seed bhs at @xmath17 , populating the @xmath18 peaks , volonteri et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are able to reproduce the mass function of local bhs as well as the abundance of the rare @xmath19 bhs that power the @xmath20 sdss quasars . proceeding to rarer peaks",
    "say , @xmath21 at @xmath17 in this scheme yields the rarer @xmath22 local umbhs . and in fact , the formation of a very small number density of umbhs at @xmath1 is inevitable in the standard hierarchical merging @xmath23cdm paradigm . a massive dm halo with mass , @xmath24 at @xmath1 which is the likely host to an umbh , is likely to have experienced about 100 mergers between @xmath16 and @xmath1 , starting with @xmath25 at @xmath16 .",
    "recently a numerical calculation of the merger scenario mentioned above has been performed in simulations by yoo et al .",
    "focusing on the merger history of high mass cluster - scale halos ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "they find that in ten realizations of halos on this mass scale , starting with the highest initial bh masses at @xmath27 of @xmath13 few times @xmath28 , 4 clusters contain umbhs at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , rare umbhs are expected in the local universe .",
    "yoo et al . ( 2007 ) argue that black hole mergers can significantly augment the high end tail of the local bh mass function .    similarly , using a model for quasar activity based on mergers of gas - rich galaxies , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2006a ) showed that they could explain the observed local bh mass at low to intermediate bh masses ( 10@xmath29 - 10@xmath30@xmath31 ) .",
    "however , at higher bh masses , their calculations overpredict the observed values even considering a possible change in the eddington fraction at higher masses .",
    "conventional models of black hole formation and growth start with initial conditions at high redshift with seed bhs that are remnants of the first generation of stars in the universe . propagating these seeds via merger accompanied accretion events leading to mass growth for the bhs ( volonteri , haardt & madau 2003 ) it has been argued that in order to explain the masses of bhs powering the bright @xmath32 quasars by the sdss survey ( fan et al .",
    "2004 ; 2006 ) that either a brief period of super - eddington accretion ( volonteri & rees 2005 ) or more massive seeds are needed ( begelman , volonteri & rees 2006 ; lodato & natarajan 2006 ; lodato & natarajan 2007 ) .",
    "massive seeds can alleviate the problem of assembling @xmath33 bhs by @xmath16 which is roughly 1 gyr after the big bang in the concordance @xmath23cdm model .",
    "the local relics of such super - grown black holes are expected to result in umbhs .",
    "we note here that following the evolution of the massive black holes that power the @xmath34 quasars , in a cosmological simulation , di matteo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find that these do not necessarily remain the most massive black holes at subsequent times .",
    "therefore , while umbhs might not be direct descendants of the smbhs that power the @xmath35 quasars , there is ample room for umbhs to form and grow .",
    "below , we briefly present scenarios that provide the massive bh seeds in the first place that will eventually result in a small population of umbhs by @xmath1 .",
    "these physically plausible mechanisms are critical to our prediction of umbhs at low redshift .",
    "two models have been proposed , one that involves starting from the remnants of population iii stars with brief episodes of accretion onto them exceeding the eddington rate to bump up their masses ( volonteri & rees 2006 ) and the other that explains direct formation of massive bh seeds prior to the formation of the first stars ( lodato & natarajan 2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "volonteri & rees ( 2005 ) have proposed a scenario to explain the high bh masses @xmath36 needed to power the luminous quasars detected @xmath16 in the sdss .",
    "this is accomplished they argue by populating the @xmath37 peaks in the dark matter density field at @xmath38 with seed bhs which arise from the remnants of population iii stars in the mass ranges @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "these remnant bhs then undergo an episode of super - eddington accretion from @xmath41 .",
    "they argue that in these high redshift , metal - free dark matter halos @xmath42 gas can cool in the absence of @xmath43 via atomic hydrogen lines to about @xmath44 . as shown by oh & haiman ( 2002 ) the gas at this temperature settles into a rotationally supported ` fat ' disk at the center of the halo under the assumption that the dm and the baryons have the same specific angular momentum .",
    "further , these disks are stable to fragmentation and therefore do not form stars and exclusively fuel the bh instead . the accretion is via stable super - critical accretion at rates well in excess of the eddington rate due to the formation of a thin , inner feeding disk . the accretion radius is comparable to the radiation trapping radius which implies that all the gas is likely to end up in the bh . any further cooling down to temperatures of @xmath45 for instance , halts the accretion , causes fragmentation of the disk which occurs when these regions of the universe have been enriched by metals .",
    "this process enables the comfortable formation of @xmath19 bhs by @xmath16 or so to explain the observed sdss quasars . in a @xmath23cdm universe ,",
    "the time available from @xmath16 to @xmath1 is @xmath46 gyr . to grow by an order of magnitude during this epoch",
    "requires an accretion rate of @xmath47 which is well below the eddington rate ; however , it requires a gas rich environment .    in recent work , lodato & natarajan ( 2007 )",
    "have shown that an ab - initio prediction for the mass function of seed black holes at high redshift can be obtained in the context of the standard @xmath23cdm paradigm for structure formation combined with careful modeling of the formation , evolution and stability of pre - galactic disks .",
    "they show that in dark matter halos at high redshifts @xmath48 , where zero metallicity pre - galactic disks assemble ( prior to the formation of the first stars ) , gravitational instabilities in these disks transfer angular momentum out and mass inwards efficiently . note that the only coolants available to the gas at this epoch are either atomic or molecular hydrogen . taking into account the stability of these disks , in particular the possibility of fragmentation",
    ", the distribution of accumulated central masses in these halos can be computed .",
    "the central mass concentrations are expected to form seed black holes .",
    "the application of stability criteria to these disks leads to distinct regimes demarcated by the value of the @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the temperature of the gas and @xmath51 is the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "the three regimes and consequences are as follows : ( i ) when @xmath52 the disk fragments and forms stars instead of a central mass concentration ; ( ii ) @xmath53 , when both central mass concentrations and stars form ; ( iii)@xmath54 , when only central mass concentrations form and the disks are stable against fragmentation . using the predicted mass function of seed black holes at @xmath48 , and propagating their growth in a merger driven accretion scenario",
    "we find that the masses of black holes powering the @xmath35 optical quasars can be comfortably accommodated and consequently a small fraction of umbhs is predicted at @xmath1 . evolving and growing these seeds to @xmath1 , the abundance of umbhs can be estimated ( volonteri , lodato & natarajan 2008 ) .",
    "the new evidence that we present in this work for the existence of a rare population of umbhs stems from using x - ray luminosity functions of agn and the implied accretion history of black holes .",
    "hard x - rays have the advantage of tracing both obscured and unobscured agn , as the effects of obscuration are less important at these energies .",
    "in particular , we use the hard x - ray luminosity function and luminosity - dependent density evolution presented by ueda et al .",
    "( 2003 ) defined from @xmath55 out to @xmath56 .",
    "we further assume that these agn are powered by bhs accreting at the eddington limit . in order to calculate bolometric luminosities starting from the hard x - ray luminosity the bolometric corrections derived from the agn spectral energy distribution library presented by treister et al .",
    "( 2006 ) are used .",
    "these are based mainly on observations of local agn and quasars and depend only on the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the source , as they are based on the x - ray to optical ratios reported by steffen et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . to account for the contribution of compton - thick agn to the black hole mass density missed in x - ray luminosity functions",
    ", we use the column density distribution of treister & urry ( 2005 ) with the relative number of compton - thick agn adapted to match the spatial density of these sources observed by integral , obtained from the agn catalog of beckmann et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in order to account for sources with column densities @xmath57=10@xmath58 - 10@xmath59  @xmath60 which do not contribute much to the x - ray background , but",
    "can make a significant contribution to the bh mass density ( e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "2004 ) , we multiply the bh mass density due to compton - thick agn by a factor of 2 , i.e. , we assume that they exist in the same numbers as in the @xmath57=10@xmath61 - 10@xmath58  @xmath60 range , in agreement with the assumption of marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and consistent with the @xmath57 distribution derived from a sample of nearby agn by risaliti et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the contribution of sources with @xmath57@xmath6210@xmath58  @xmath60 to the total population of smbhs is @xmath137% .",
    "we then convert these x - ray lf s to an equivalent bh mass function , and evolve these mass functions by assuming that accretion continues at the eddington rate down to @xmath55 .",
    "the results of this procedure are shown in fig .  2 for three different values of the accretion efficiency @xmath63 .",
    "note that we do not consider models in which the efficiency parameter varies with redshift or bh mass since such models merely add more unconstrained parameters . as can be seen clearly in fig .  2 , these simple models do not reproduce the observed local black hole mass function at the high mass end .",

    "this is fairly robust as this population is predicted for a large range of efficiencies .",

    "( 2007 ) and references therein ) , suggesting that the x - ray view presents a fairly complete picture of the accretion and growth of bhs .",
    "note that our estimates of the black hole mass function are in general agreement with those of marconi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) [ for a direct comparison see their fig .   2 , right - hand panel ]",

    "estimates by other authors are also in agreement with our treatment here out to masses of a few times @xmath72 . for bh masses",
    "@xmath73 , there appears to be consistency between the optical and x - ray views of black hole growth .",
    "however for @xmath74 , all models that assume eddington accretion with varying efficiencies systematically over - estimate the local abundance of high mass black holes .        as can be seen in fig .  2 , for a reasonable value of the efficiency , @xmath75",
    ", there is a good agreement between the bh mass density at @xmath55 , as obtained from the velocity dispersion of bulges , and the density inferred from agn relics , for bh masses smaller than @xmath76 .",
    "however , for higher masses , in particular the umbh mass range , independent of the value of @xmath63 assumed , the bh mass density from agn relics is significantly higher than the observed value , indicating that umbhs should be more abundant than current observations suggest .",
    "if there is a mass dependent efficiency factor for accretion such that higher mass bhs tend to accrete at higher efficiency and hence at lower rates , then our estimate of the high mass tail would be an over - estimate .",
    "there is however no evidence for such a mass dependence at lower masses ( hopkins , narayan & hernquist 2006 ) .",

    "such a steepening simulates the cut - off of a self - regulation mechanism that limits black hole masses and sets in at every epoch*.    in fig .  3 ,",
    "the results of such a self - limiting growth model are plotted .",

    "we predict the abundance of umbhs at @xmath1 to be @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , requiring consistency between the x - ray and optical views of black hole growth and assembly with the observed number of umbhs at @xmath1 , points to the existence of a self - regulation mechanism that limits bh masses .",
    "the self - regulation is implemented as a steepening of the x - ray agn lf at the luminous end ( the value of @xmath82 needed is plotted in fig .  4 ) and does not have an important effect on the x - ray background , since this change in slope only affects sources with x - ray luminosities @xmath90 greater than 10@xmath91  erg  s@xmath92 , while most of the x - ray background emission is produced by sources with luminosities of 10@xmath93  erg  s@xmath92 , as found by treister & urry ( 2005 ) .",
    "note that the use of a bolometric luminosity function , as reported by hopkins , richards & hernquist ( 2007 ) does not match the slope at the high mass end ( shown as the dashed curve in fig .",
    "one key consequence of our model is that the slope of the @xmath94 relation at the high mass end likely evolves with redshift .",
    "recent cosmological simulations find evidence for such a trend ( di matteo et al 2008 ) .",

    "given that star formation and black hole fueling appear to be coupled ( e.g. di matteo et al . 2005 and references therein ; silk & rees 1998 ) , it is likely that there is a self - limiting growth cycle for bhs and therefore a physical upper limit to their masses . here",
    "we present several distinct arguments that can be used to estimate the final masses of bhs ( haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ; silk & rees 1998 ; murray , quataert & thompson 2004 and king 2005 ) .",
    "these involve self - limiting growth due to a momentum - driven wind , self - limiting growth due to the radiation pressure of a momentum - driven wind , and from an energy - driven superwind model .",
    "murray , quataert & thompson ( 2004 ) argue that the feedback from momentum driven winds , limits the stellar luminosity , which in turn regulates the bh mass .",
    "they argue for eddington limited star formation with a maximum stellar luminosity , @xmath96 where , @xmath97 is the gas fraction in the halo and @xmath3 the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy .",
    "star formation in this scheme is unlikely to evacuate the gas at small radius in the galactic nucleus , therefore , all the gas in the inner - most regions fuel the bh .",
    "the growing bh itself clears out this nuclear region with its accretion luminosity approaches @xmath98 . at this point",
    "the fuel supply to the bh is shut - off and this may shut off the star formation as well . the final bh mass is then given by , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "for the most massive , nearby early - type galaxies at the very tail of the measured sdss velocity dispersion function with velocity dispersions of @xmath13 350 - 400 kms@xmath92 ( bernardi et al . 2005 ) this gives a final bh mass of @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , normal galaxies with large velocity dispersions are the presumptive hosts for umbhs .",
    "furthermore , there appears to be a strong indication of the existence of an upper mass limit for accreting black holes derived from sdss dr3 by vestergard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in every redshift bin from @xmath102 .",
    "an alternative upper limit can be obtained when the emitted energy from the accreting bh back reacts with the accretion flow itself ( haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ) .",
    "the final shut - down of accretion will depend on whether the emitted energy can back - react on the accretion flow prior to fuel exhaustion .",
    "this arguement provides a limit , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the fraction of the accretion luminosity which is deposited as kinetic energy into the accretion flow ( cf .",
    "silk & rees 1998 ) , @xmath105 is the spin parameter of the dm halo , @xmath106 is the specific angular momentum of the disk , @xmath107 is the disk mass fraction .",
    "the back - reaction timescale will be related to the dynamical timescale of the outer parts of the disk and/or the core of the dm halo and should set the duration of the optically bright phase .",
    "it is interesting to note here that the accretion rate will change from super - eddington to sub - eddington without much gain in mass if the back - reaction timescale is shorter than the salpeter time .",
    "the overall emission efficiency is then determined by the value of @xmath108 when the back - reaction sets in and is reduced by a factor @xmath109 compared to accretion at below the eddington rate . by substituting the value of the velocity dispersion of nearby cd s @xmath110 , we obtain a limiting value of the mass , if we assume that the bulk of the mass growth occurs in the optically bright quasar phase . due to the dependence on the spin parameter @xmath105 of the dm halo ,",
    "the desired umbh mass range can arise preferentially in high velocity dispersion halos with low spin .    king ( 2005 ) presents a model that exploits the observed agn - starburst connection to couple black hole growth and star formation . as the black hole grows , an outflow drives a shell into the surrounding gas which stalls after a dynamical time - scale at a radius determined by the bh mass .",
    "the gas trapped inside this bubble cools , forms stars and is recycled as accretion and outflow .",
    "once the bh reaches a critical mass , this region attains a size such that the gas can no longer cool efficiently .",
    "the resulting energy - driven flow expels the remaining gas as a superwind , thereby fixing the observed @xmath4 relation as well as the total stellar mass of the bulge at values in good agreement with current observations .",
    "the limiting bh mass is given by : @xmath111 where @xmath97 is the gas fraction ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 the electron scattering opacity and @xmath3 the velocity dispersion .",
    "this model argues that black hole growth inevitably produces starburts and ultimately a superwind .",
    "note that both the murray , quataert & thompson ( 2004 ) model and the king ( 2005 ) model predict @xmath114 while the haehnelt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and silk & rees ( 1998 ) predict a @xmath115 dependence .",
    "the current error bars on the observational mass estimates for black holes preclude discrimination between these two possibilities .",
    "shutdown of star formation above a critical halo mass effected by the growing agn has also been proposed as a self - limiting mechanism to cap bh growth and simultaneously explain the dichotomy in galaxy properties ( croton et al .",
    "2006 ; cattaneo et al .",
    "umbhs are expected to be rare in the local universe , from our analysis of the x - ray luminosity function of agn , we predict an abundance ranging from @xmath13 few times @xmath116 .",
    "these estimates are in good agreement with those obtained from optical quasars in the sdss dr3 by vestergard et al .",
    "the results of the first attempts to detect and measure masses for umbhs is promising .",
    "dalla bonta et al . ( 2007 ) selected 3 brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) in abell 1836 , abell 2052 and abell 3565 . using acs ( advanced camera for surveys ) aboard the hubble space telescope and the imaging spectrograph ( stis ) , they obtained high resolution spectroscopy of the @xmath117 and @xmath118ii emission lines to measure the kinematics of the central ionized gas .",
    "they present bh mass estimates for 2 of these bcgs , @xmath119 and @xmath120 and an upper limit for the bh mass on the third candidate of @xmath121 .",
    "it is interesting to note that bernardi et al .",
    "( 2005 ) in a census of the most massive galaxies in the sdss survey do find candidates with large velocity dispersions @xmath122 .",
    "the largest systems they find are claimed to be extremes of the early - type galaxy population , as they have the largest velocity dispersions . these @xmath123 systems ( see table 1 of bernardi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for details on these candidates ) are not distant outliers from the fundamental plane and the mass - to - light scaling relations defined by the bulk of the early - type galaxy population .",
    "clear outliers from these scaling relations tend to be objects in superposition for which they have evidence from spectra and images .",
    "we argue that these extreme early - type galaxies might harbour umbhs and likely their abundance offers key constraints on the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "although the observations are challenging , a more comprehensive and systematic survey of nearby bcgs is likely to yield our first local umbh before long . as discussed above",
    ", candidates from the sdss are promising targets for observational follow - up as they are extremely luminous . utilizing the hubble space telescope",
    ", the light profile might show evidence for the existence of an umbh in the center ( e.g. lauer et al .",
    "in fact , for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , it may be possible to measure spatially resolved velocity dispersion profiles even from ground - based facilities .",
    "the interplay between the evolution of bhs and the hierarchical build - up of galaxies appears as scaling relations between the masses of bhs and global properties of their hosts such as the bh mass vs. bulge velocity dispersion - the @xmath126 relation and the bh mass vs. bulge luminosity @xmath127 relation .",
    "the low bh mass end of this relation has recently been probed by ferrarese et al .",
    "( 2006 ) in an acs survey of the virgo cluster galaxies .",
    "they find that galaxies brighter than @xmath128 host a supermassive central bh whereas fainter galaxies host a central nucleus , referred to as a central massive object ( cmo ) .",
    "ferrarese et al .",
    "report that a common @xmath129 relation leads smoothly down from the scaling relations observed for more more massive galaxies .",
    "extrapolating observed scaling relations to higher bh masses to the umbh range , we predict that these are likely hosted by the massive , high luminosity , central galaxies in clusters with large velocity dispersions .",
    "the velocity dispersion function of early - type galaxies measured from the sdss points to the existence of a high velocity dispersion tail with @xmath130 ( bernardi et al .",
    "if the observed scaling relations extend to the higher mass end as well , these early - types are the most likely hosts for umbhs .",
    "recent simulation work that follows the merger history of cluster scale dark matter halos and the growth of bhs hosted in them by yoo et al.(2007 ) also predict the existence of a rare population of local umbhs . however , theoretical arguments suggest that there may be an upper limit to the mass of a bh that can grow in a given galactic nucleus hosted in a dark matter halo of a given spin . clearly the issue of the existence of umbhs is intimately linked to the efficiency of galaxy formation and the formation of the largest , most luminous and massive galaxies in the universe .",
    "possible explanations for the tight correlation observed between the velocity dispersion of the spheroid and black hole mass involve a range of self - regulated feedback prescriptions .",
    "an estimate of the upper limits on the black hole mass that can assemble in the most massive spheroids can be derived for all these models and they all point to the existence of umbhs .    in this paper , we have argued that while rare umbhs likely exist , there is nevertheless an upper limit of @xmath131 for the mass of bhs that inhabit galactic nuclei in the universe .",
    "we first show that our current understanding of the accretion history and mass build up of black holes allows and implies the existence of umbhs locally .",
    "this is primarily driven by new work that predicts the formation of massive black hole seeds at high redshift ( lodato & natarajan 2007 ) and their subsequent evolution ( volonteri , lodato & natarajan 2008 ) . starting with massive seeds and following their build - up through hierarchical merging in the context of structure formation in a cold dark matter dominated universe",
    ", we show that a viable pathway to the formation of umbhs exists .",
    "there is also compelling evidence from the observed evolution of x - ray agn for the existence of a local umbh population . convolving the observed x - ray lf s of agn , with a simple accretion model",
    ", the mass function of black holes at @xmath1 is estimated .",
    "mimic - ing the effect of self - regulation processes that impose an upper limit to bh masses and incorporating this into the x - ray agn lf we find that the observed umbh mass function at @xmath1 is reproduced .",
    "this self - regulation limited growth is implemented by steepening the high luminosity end of the agn lf at the bright end .",
    "we estimate the abundance of umbhs to be @xmath132 at @xmath1 .",
    "the key prediction of our model is that the slope of the @xmath4 relation likely evolves with redshift at the high mass end .",
    "probing this is observationally challenging at the present time but there are several bright , massive early - type galaxies that are promising host candidates from the sdss survey as well as a survey of bright central galaxies of nearby clusters .",
    "observational detection of umbhs will provide key insights into the physics of galaxy formation and black hole assembly in the universe .",
