    "it is fundamental to ask how an amplification of canonical variables modifies the phase - space distribution of amplified states under the physical constraint due to canonical uncertainty relations .",
    "the standard theory to address this question is the _ so - called _ amplification uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "it describes the property of inevitable noise addition on canonical variables when the field amplitude of an unknown state is linearly transformed through a quantum channel .",
    "this traditional form of quantum amplification limits is directly derived from the property of canonical variables , and gives an important insight on a wide class of experiments in quantum optics , quantum information science , and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the linearity of amplification maps assumed in this theory is hardly satisfied in the experiments @xcite , although this assumption corresponds to a covariance property that works as an essential theoretical tool to analyze a general property of amplification and related cloning maps .",
    "it is more realistic to consider the performance of amplifiers in a limited input space .",
    "in fact , one can find a practical limitation by focusing on a set of input states or an ensemble of input states @xcite .",
    "there has been a growing interest in implementing probabilistic amplifiers in order to overcome the standard limitation of the traditional amplification limit . in these approaches",
    ", one can obtain essentially noiselessly amplified coherent states with a certain probability by conditionally choosing the output of the process .",
    "recent theoretical studies have determined amplification limits for such cases of probabilistic quantum channels or general quantum operations @xcite .",
    "certainly , these results can reach beyond the coverage of the traditional theory .",
    "however , it seems difficult to find a precise interrelation between these theories .",
    "for example , it is not clear whether the traditional form can be reproduced as a special case of the general theory . at this stage",
    ", we may no longer expect an essential role of canonical uncertainty relations in determining a general form of amplification limits .",
    "another topical aspect on the probabilistic amplification is its connection to entanglement distillation . on the one hand ,",
    "the no - go theorem of gaussian entanglement distillation tells us that gaussian operations are unusable for distillation of gaussian entanglement @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been shown that a specific design of non - deterministic linear amplifier ( nla ) can enhance entanglement @xcite , and experimental demonstrations of entanglement distillation have been reported in @xcite .",
    "thereby , such an enhancement of entanglement could signify a clear advantage of no - gaussian operations over the gaussian operations .",
    "interestingly , a substantial difference between an optimal amplification fidelity for deterministic quantum gates and that for probabilistic physical processes has been shown in ref .  @xcite . in there ,",
    "a standard gaussian amplifier is identified as an optimal deterministic process for maximizing the fidelity , while the nla turns out to achieve the maximal fidelity for probabilistic gates in an asymptotical manner .",
    "however , these amplification fidelities have not been associated with the context of entanglement distillation .",
    "hence , it is interesting if one can find a legitimate amplification limit for gaussian operations such that the physical process beyond the limit demonstrates the advantage of non - gaussian operations .",
    "more fundamentally , we may ask whether an amplification limit for gaussian operations could be derived as a consequence of the no - go theorem .    the fidelity - based amplification limit @xcite",
    "is defined on an input - state ensemble called the _",
    "gaussian distributed coherent states_. this ensemble has been utilized to demonstrate a non - classical performance of continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum memories @xcite .",
    "the main idea underlying this ensemble is to consider an effectively uniform set of input states in a cv space by using a gaussian prior .",
    "we can sample coherent states with modest input power around the origin of the phase - space with a relatively flat prior while a rapid decay of the prior enables us to suppress the contribution of impractically high - energy input states .",
    "given this ensemble , an experimental success criterion for cv gates is to surpass the classical limit fidelity due to _ entanglement breaking _ ( eb ) maps @xcite .",
    "the classical fidelity was determined for unit - gain channels in ref .",
    "@xcite and for lossy / amplification channels in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "further , the framework was generalized to include whole completely - positive ( cp ) maps , i.e. , general quantum operations @xcite .",
    "recently , a different form of such classical limits has been derived using an uncertainty product of canonical variables @xcite .",
    "it gives an optimal trade - off relation between canonical noises in order to outperform eb maps for general amplification / attenuation tasks .",
    "this suggests that , instead of the fidelity , one can use an uncertainty product of canonical variables to evaluate the performance of amplifiers .",
    "however , for a general amplification process , it remains open ( i ) how much excess noise is unavoidable on canonical variables and ( ii ) whether there exists a simple trade - off relation between noises of the canonical pair .",
    "in this paper we resolve above questions by presenting an uncertainty - product form of amplification limits for general quantum operations based on the input ensemble of gaussian distributed coherent states .",
    "it is directly derived by using canonical uncertainty relations and retrieves basic property of the traditional amplification limit .",
    "we investigate attainability of our amplification limit and identify a parameter regime where gaussian channels can not achieve our bound but the nla asymptotically achieves our bound .",
    "we also point out the role of probabilistic amplifiers for entanglement distillation . using the no - go theorem for gaussian entanglement distillation",
    "we find a condition that a probabilistic amplifier can be regarded as a local filtering operation to demonstrate entanglement distillation .",
    "this condition establishes a clear benchmark to verify an advantage of non - gaussian operations beyond gaussian operations with a feasible input set of coherent states and standard homodyne measurements .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ ourlimit ] ,",
    "we present our amplification limit which is regarded as an extension of the traditional amplification limit @xcite for two different directions : ( i ) it determines the limitation with an input ensemble of a bounded power ; ( ii ) it is applicable to stochastic quantum processes as well as quantum channels . in section  [ attainabilityamplimit ] , we consider attainability of our amplification limit for gaussian and non - gaussian amplifiers . in section  [ distilbound ] , we address the connection between our amplification limit and entanglement distillation .",
