    "these states can be obtained from the vacuum using the creation and annihilation operators as @xmath11 the transformation properties of the creation and annihilation operators under poincar  group are fixed by this relation .",

    "extensively discussed in @xcite and which we will adopt here , the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are just the clebsch - gordon coefficients to select from the chosen hlg representation the desired poincar  irrep .",
    "the case of particles with well defined parity in the @xmath16 representation of the hlg can be found in @xcite and yields the conventional dirac formalism where the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are now interpreted as states with well defined parity .",
    "form this point of view , dirac theory is appropriate for the description of particles with well defined parity and it can be shown that dirac equation is just the equation for projection onto well defined states in the @xmath16 representation .",
    "similarly , the conventional proca equation is just the projection onto a subspace with well defined parity in the @xmath17 representation of the hlg . unlike the @xmath16 representation which contains only spin 1/2 ,",
    "in the @xmath17 case there are two poincar sectors and it can be shown that parity projection and poincar projection coincide .    in @xcite",
    "a formalism was developed for the description of spin 3/2 fields using the projectors over well defined mass and spin in the spinor - vector representation .",
    "these ideas were also applied to the vector representation in @xcite . gauging the formalism to account for electromagnetic interactions , in both cases",
    "we obtain a theory containing a free parameter , @xmath2 , which can be identified with the gyromagnetic factor . for elementary particles ,",
    "this parameter is fixed using general arguments . in the spin 3/2 case it is shown in @xcite",
    "that causality of the interacting theory requires @xmath18 at tree level .",
    "this value for the gyromagnetic factor has been obtained for general fields using unitarity , gauge invariance and rotational symmetry arguments @xcite ( see also @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , but to the best of our knowledge has never been related to causality of the interacting theory which historically has been a severe problem for interacting high spin fields .",
    "the poincar projector formalism was used to calculate compton scattering off spin 3/2 particles @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that @xmath18 is necessary for the good behavior of differential cross section for compton scattering off spin 3/2 particles in the forward direction . concerning vector fields ,",
    "the good behavior of the total cross section for compton scattering at high energies also requires @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that this value is required also by the good behavior of the differential cross section in the forward direction . with this value",
    ", the poincar projector formalism predicts the same electromagnetic couplings for the @xmath20 as those obtained in the standard model .    as a side result ,",
    "since the electromagnetic couplings of vector and spinor - vector fields are described by a single parameter beyond the electric charge , the poincar projector formalism predicts specific relations between the multipole moments of spin 1 particles transforming in the vector representation and spin 3/2 particles transforming in the spinor - vector representation of the hlg . in the vector case",
    ", these relations are explicitly given in @xcite and in particular are well satisfied by the @xmath20 boson whose magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments have been measured by the delphi coll .",
    "a closer look at these relations will be presented elsewhere .    in this work",
    ", we will be interested in developing a formalism for the description of spin 1/2 particles using poincar projectors .",
    "these projectors fix only the properties defining a particle , mass and spin , but do not fix any other property such as parity thus we expect a proper description of general spin 1/2 particles , not only dirac particles ( spin 1/2 particles with well defined parity ) .",
    "poincar projectors yield second order equations thus we obtain a second order formalism for spin 1/2 fermions .",
    "such possibility was addressed by feynman and gellmann long ago aiming to describe chiral fermions required by the weak interactions @xcite .",
    "some authors studied a second order formalism for fermions along feynman - gellmann proposal @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite@xcite .",
    "we will see below that the projector formalism differ from feynman - gellmann like formalisms .",
    "the structure of this work is the following : in the next section we give all the elements concerning the solving of the hlg algebra for the @xmath0 representation , section iii is devoted to the construction of the formalism , in section iv we calculate compton scattering and compare with some experimental results for compton scattering off protons at low energies .",

    ", it is clear that the description of the proton electromagnetic properties at low energies requires a more elaborate analysis . in particular",
    "it is necessary to include the polarizability of the proton which is strong and due mainly to the @xmath194 resonance .",
    "this is more transparent when we analyze the experimental data for the differential cross section at a fixed angle as a function of the incident photon energy .",
    "for example , taking @xmath187 and @xmath188 , from eq .",
    "( [ angdist ] ) we obtain the results shown in figure [ ds ] together with data form mami @xcite for fixed @xmath195 .     as a function of the incoming photon energy @xmath156 .",
    "data is taken from table 2 of @xcite .",
    "the solid line is the prediction of the second order formalism when we use the central values for @xmath186 and @xmath196 in the fit to the angular distribution in figure [ angdistplot ] . ]",
    "we obtain the correct description at very low energy . for photon energies above 80 mev",
    "the effects of the @xmath194 , which has a width of the order of 120 mev , start being visible .",
    "we remark that a complete description of the proton electromagnetic properties at low energy is beyond the scope of this work and we just aim to show that such description is possible in the second order formalism and that , from the effective theory point of view , it is a more natural starting point .",
    "finally we would like to stress that our formalism differs from the feynman - gellmann second order formalism for fermions in @xcite .",
    "indeed , feynman - gellman description is based on the decomposition of dirac states into weyl states and the rewriting of the conventional dirac theory in this basis . as a consequence ,",
    "this formalism is still appropriate to describe particles with well defined parity , although in a non conventional basis .",
    "the physics under gauging is the same as that of dirac theory and in particular a feynman - gellman fermion has also @xmath179 .",
    "clearly , our formalism generalize these results .",
    "in this work we develop a second order formalism for spin 1/2 fermions based on the projection over poincar invariant subspaces in the @xmath0 representation of the homogeneous lorentz group .",
    "the theory fixes only the mass and spin of the particle but not any other property and in general contains two free parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which can not be fixed from poincar projectors , the latter being related to odd - parity lorentz structures . gauging the formalism",
    "we obtain a gauge invariant second order description for the electromagnetic interactions of a spin 1/2 fermion .",
    "we calculate compton scattering off a spin 1/2 fermion in this formalism . in the particular case @xmath197 and for states in @xmath16 with well defined parity",
    "reduces our results reduce to those of the conventional dirac theory .",
    "in the general case we find the correct classical limit and a finite value @xmath5 for the forward differential cross section , independently of the photon energy and of the value of the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , the differential cross section vanishes at high energies for all @xmath6 except in the forward direction . for the total cross section at low energies we obtain the thomson value for all @xmath6 and at high energies it vanishes only for @xmath4 , reaching a finite value otherwise .",
    "we argue that from the effective theory point of view , the formalism is more appropriate than dirac theory as a starting point for the description of electromagnetic properties of baryons and illustrate the point analyzing the low energy electromagnetic properties of the proton and comparing with recent experimental results .",
