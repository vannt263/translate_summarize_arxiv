    "several previous studies@xcite of the metal - insulator transition and the magnetic properties of the insulating phase@xcite of the @xmath0 family have been interpreted in terms of the hubbard model . however ,",
    "this is inadequate because , at quarter filling , the hubbard model is expected to be metallic .",
    "following seo@xcite , we argue that the nearest neighbour coulomb repulsion @xmath2 plays a crucial role in these materials .",
    "this has been emphasized before for other organics.@xcite    specifically , the simplest possible strongly correlated electron model that can describe the competition between all of the above phases is the extended hubbard model ( or a @xmath10 model with no double occupancy ) at quarter - filling on a square lattice .",
    "we show that in the charge - ordered insulating phase antiferromagnetic interactions arise due to a novel fourth - order superexchange around a plaquette on the square lattice .",
    "we then consider the su(n ) generalization of the @xmath10 model and perform a slave boson study which becomes exact in the limit of large n. we find there is a critical value of the ratio @xmath11 , above which the metallic fermi liquid phase undergoes an instability to a charge ordered state .",

    "the only member of the @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1x family that is superconducting is x = i@xmath6 which has a transition temperature of 3.6 k. the fermi surface of the metallic phase has been mapped out using angular - dependent magnetoresistance and magnetic oscillations.@xcite several of the @xmath0-(bets)@xmath1x family undergo a metal - insulator transition and several are metallic down to 4 k ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",

    "band structure calculations@xcite predict that all these materials are metallic .",
    "hence , the different phases must be due to strong electronic interactions .",
    "the hubbard interaction @xmath17 describing the coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same bedt - ttf molecule has been estimated from quantum chemistry calculations to be about 4 ev.@xcite thus @xmath17 is much larger than the band width associated with the hopping integrals given in table 1 , confirming that these are strongly correlated materials .",
    "the hubbard model on the square lattice at quarter filling is expected to be always metallic and so one must consider longer range coulomb interactions to explain the existence of insulating , charge ordered and antiferromagnetic phases .",
    "the nearest neighbour coulomb repulsion between various arrangements of pairs of bedt - ttf molecules has also been estimated from quantum chemistry calculations@xcite and is generally found to have a value of about 2 - 3 ev .",
    "it is approximately given by coulomb s law @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is in @xmath20 .",
    "mori calculated @xmath2 as a function of the angle @xmath0 ; variations of about ten per cent occur in the range ( 98 - 130 degrees ) relevant to the @xmath0-type materials .",
    "these calculations involve isolated pairs of molecules and so one expects that the values of @xmath17 and @xmath2 in a molecular crystal to be less than this due to screening .",

    "the difference @xmath21 can be estimated from the charge transfer excitation seen in optical absorption measurements . for ( bedt - ttf)hgbr@xmath6",
    "it is estimated to be 0.7 ev.@xcite thus we are led to the extended hubbard model on the anisotropic triangular lattice at half filling .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that for many of the @xmath0 materials , @xmath22 and so , as a first approximation , we neglect the diagonal hopping @xmath23 .",
    "this means we are left with a square lattice model . in section [ slave ] we will show that this diagonal term has little effect on the metal - insulator transition . the hamiltonian is @xmath24 where @xmath17 is the coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the same site , @xmath2 is the nearest neighbour coulomb repulsion , @xmath25 denotes nearest neighbours , and @xmath26 is the chemical potential .",
    "if we consider the large @xmath17 limit and so preclude doubly occupied sites , the hamiltonian then reduces to @xmath27 where @xmath28 projects out the doubly occupied states .",
    "we refer to this as the @xmath10 model .    for large @xmath11",
    "the ground state is an insulator with charge ordering ( section [ afm ] ) .",
    "we expect that for small @xmath11 a metallic phase exists because the quarter - filled fermi surface is poorly nested .",
    "hence , as @xmath11 decreases the charge ordering should be destroyed at a non - zero value of @xmath11 .",
    "we are not aware of any previous study of this model on the square lattice .",
    "mazumdar , clay , and campbell@xcite have studied coupled chains of the extended hubbard model at quarter filling .",
    "most of their numerical results are for @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( where the @xmath31 refers to the chain direction ) so that @xmath32 is smaller than the critical value necessary to form the charge ordered state considered here .",
    "they find that when interactions with phonons are included there is a tendency to formation of a bond - order wave .",
    "henley and zhang recently considered a similar model involving spinless fermions on the square lattice.@xcite mila considered the extended hubbard model on the square lattice at a quarter filling with finite @xmath17 and infinite @xmath2.@xcite in section [ slave ] we consider the su(n ) generalization of the @xmath10 model and show that in the large n limit , slave boson theory implies that there is a critical value of @xmath11 above which the metallic phase becomes unstable to formation of charge ordering .",
    "we now briefly review previous work on the extended hubbard model ( in the large @xmath17 limit ) at quarter filling on different lattices .",
    "numerical calculations show that a single chain undergoes a transition from a luttinger liquid to a charge - density wave insulator at @xmath33.@xcite the one - dimensional @xmath10 model can be solved exactly via the bethe ansatz@xcite .",
    "it is equivalent to two decoupled xxz spin chains and so will undergo a metal - isulator transition at @xmath33 .",
    "we note that the ring exchange process responsible for antiferromagnetic interactions discussed above will be absent in a single chain .",
    "vojta , hbsch , and noack@xcite recently studied the model ( [ ham ] ) on a ladder using the density matrix renormalisation group .",
    "they find that the charge ordered phase is destroyed for @xmath34 but claim that there will be a charge gap for all @xmath11 .",
    "the model in infinite dimensions was studied by pietig , bulla , and blawid using dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite at low temperatures they found that for @xmath35 , charge ordering occured for @xmath36 .",
    "for large @xmath11 there will be charge ordering and the ground state will be an insulator with a charge gap of magnitude @xmath37",
    ". there will be two possible ground states with the checker - board covering of the lattice ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this defines a new square lattice rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the original square lattice .",
    "it should be stressed that these ground states are distinct from the commensurate charge density waves , associated with a lattice distortion , and seen in some organics . to zero - th order in @xmath38 all possible spin states",
    "will be degenerate .",
    "we consider a single placquette ( fig . [ fig3 ] ) containing two spins .",
    "to second order in @xmath38 both the singlet and triplet states have their energy lowered by @xmath39 .",
    "the degeneracy of the singlet and triplet states is only broken to fourth order in @xmath38 .",
    "we show below that this results in an effective antiferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath40 which acts along the diagonals of the original square lattice .",
    "thus the spin degrees of freedom are described by a spin-@xmath41 heisenberg model on a square lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes a spin operator on site @xmath44 , and the sum @xmath45 runs over pairs of next - nearest neighbor lattice sites in the original square lattice .",
    "we now calculate the singlet - triplet splitting from fourth - order perturbation theory . if @xmath46 is an eigenstate of @xmath47 then a perturbation @xmath48 , which has no effect to third order , shifts the energy by @xmath49 where the intermediate states labelled by @xmath50 are not degenerate with @xmath46 .",
    "the following process involving exchange of electrons around a placquette will contribute to a shift in the energy of the ground state .",
    "for the triplet states it can be represented as @xmath51 the first , second , and fourth matrix elements are @xmath3 and the third is @xmath52 .",
    "the intermediate states have energy @xmath37 , @xmath53 , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "( note one needs to take into account the interaction with the neighbours not shown in the above representation ) .",
    "there are eight distinct ways of doing this exchange : at the first step there is four choices and at the third step there are two choices .",
    "thus , the expression ( [ pert4 ] ) implies that the triplet is increased in energy by @xmath54 .",
    "a similar process for the singlet is @xmath55 thus , for the singlet this fourth - order process brings one back to the singlet wave function with a sign change and so the energy shift is opposite to that of the triplet .",
    "hence , we arrive at ( [ jeff ] ) for the difference in energy between the singlet and triplet .    it should be pointed out that there are also fourth order processes of the form @xmath56 which will produce a decrease in the ground state energy . however , because they produce the same shift for the singlet and triplet states we neglect them here .",
    "our value of @xmath13 is consistent with a recent calculation@xcite of the effective exchange interaction in the charge ordered phase of the extended hubbard model on a ladder when that result is rescaled to allow for different excitation energies of the intermediate states .",
    "for the ladder , the energies of the intermediate states are all @xmath57 . thus the ladder exchange is larger than for the square lattice by a factor of 9/2 .",
    "we now consider whether this possible explanation for the origin of antiferromagnetism in the @xmath0 type materials is quantitatively reasonable .",
    "roughly , it predicts that the value of @xmath13 will be some fraction of @xmath3 , typical values@xcite from table [ table1 ] are of the order of 500 - 1000 k for the materials with insulating ground states .",
    "@xmath0-(c@xmath15tet - ttf)@xmath1br is an insulator with a charge gap of 600 mev and a value of @xmath3@xcite of about 60 mev.@xcite since the charge gap is @xmath37 for @xmath58 this gives @xmath59 200 mev .",
    "using @xmath60 gives @xmath61 4 k ( check ) which is in reasonable agreement with the observed value of 6 k. we do not make quantitative comparisons of equation ( [ jeff ] ) because they are not so clearly in the regime @xmath58 , required for its validity .",
    "for example , for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)[n(cn)@xmath1]@xmath1 hckel calculations give @xmath62 80 mev and the measured charge gap@xcite is about 200 mev .",
    "this is inconsistent with the fact that the charge gap would be @xmath37 if @xmath58 .",
    "we consider the su(n ) generalization of the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) for which the spin index , @xmath64 , runs from 1 to @xmath65 , and consider @xmath66 as a small expansion parameter assuming that @xmath65 is large .",
    "slave boson fields are introduced to allow treatment of the no double occupancy constraint required by the @xmath63 limit .",
    "the effective action for the slave boson fields can be expanded in powers of @xmath66 .",
    "the mean - field solution corresponds to the gutzwiller approximation and is exact in the @xmath67 limit.@xcite this approach has been used to study other strongly correlated models such as the kondo model for magnetic impurities@xcite in metals , the hubbard model@xcite , the hubbard - holstein model@xcite and the anderson@xcite and kondo lattices.@xcite it has also been used to analyze the phase diagram of two - dimensional t - j model@xcite , and extended hubbard model at half - filling.@xcite it is convenient to describe the projected hilbert space associated with the hamiltonian ( [ ham2 ] ) , using the slave boson representation.@xcite the electron creation operator is replaced by : @xmath68 , where the spinless charged boson operator , @xmath69 , is introduced to keep track of the empty sites , and @xmath70 is a fermion operator carrying spin . in order to preserve the anticommutation relation for the electrons the new operators must satisfy the local constraint @xmath71 for @xmath72 it reduces to the condition that either an electron or a boson can occupy each lattice site at all times .",

    "while the divergence at @xmath147 appears because it is not possible to have charge ordering when there is no charge in the lattice , the divergence at @xmath148 is a consequence of the condition that there can be , at most , one electron at each lattice site : a charge ordered state of alternating singly and doubly occupied sites would cost infinite energy to be formed . the divergence at @xmath149 is non - trivial and presumably is a consequence of the finding made by tandon _",
    "et al._@xcite that close to half - filling , @xmath150 , the @xmath66 fluctuations drive the @xmath63 hubbard model into phase separation .",
    "hence , the creation of a charge ordered state is forbidden by the breakdown of periodicity in the charge distribution of the lattice . at a quarter filling ( @xmath111 ) equation ( [ vcrit ] ) gives @xmath151 .",

    "the critical value changes from 0.68 for the square lattice to @xmath154 for the triangular lattice ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "this can be understood if we plot the fermi surfaces for different ratios of the hopping integrals for fixed band filling : @xmath111 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "while for the square lattice case , @xmath156 , the fermi surface shows some remnants of the perfect nesting property present at half - filling , it gradually elongates along the @xmath157 direction becoming elliptical as @xmath153 is increased.@xcite this effect makes it even harder to connect two points at the fermi surface by the wavevector @xmath158 . the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , also shows that it is possible to go from the metallic phase to the charge ordered state by varying either the @xmath153 or @xmath11 ratios . because the dependence of @xmath159 on @xmath153 is weak",
    "we conclude that the ratio @xmath11 plays a more important role than @xmath153 in driving the metal - insulator transition , within the large - n approach used here .",
    "hence , as a first approximation we are justified in neglecting the effect of the diagonal hopping , as was done in section [ afm ] .",
    "mori@xcite found that the coulomb repulsion @xmath2 varied little with the angle @xmath0 .",
    "this is because it scales roughly with the inverse of the distance between the molecules .",
    "in contrast the hopping integrals @xmath16 and @xmath23 depend strongly on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath16 varies by about a factor of five as @xmath0 varies from 100 to 140 degrees .",
    "this is because the overlap integral depends exponentially on the distance between the molecules .",
    "hence , the main effect of varying @xmath0 is to change the band width .",
    "this is what will be driving the metal - insulator transition .    for @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1cu@xmath1(cn)[n(cn)@xmath1]@xmath1",
    "the measured charge gap@xcite is about 200 mev , suggesting that @xmath2 is of the order of 100 mev . assuming that @xmath2 does not vary much between materials the above calculations suggest that the critical value of the hopping integral @xmath3 is about 100 mev",
    "this is consistent@xcite with the values in table [ table1 ] ; i.e. , it is quite possible that the materials listed there are close to the metal - insulator transition , as is observed experimentally .",
    "the family @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath5yso@xmath6 has been studied@xcite with y = ch@xmath1cf@xmath1 , ch@xmath1 , chf .",
    "the first material is superconducting with a transition temperature of 5.2 k. y = ch@xmath1 is insulating with a charge gap of 56 mev and evidence for charge ordering is found in the fact that alternate molecules have a different bond length and phonon frequency associated with the central carbon double bond.@xcite the charges are estimated to be @xmath160 and @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the electronic charge .",
    "below room temperature the spin susceptibility decreases monotonically , consistent with a spin gap of 8 mev .",
    "y = chf is a bad metal and may undergo a metal - semiconductor transition below 10 k. it is estimated that alternate molecules have charges of @xmath163 and @xmath164 a recent experimental study@xcite estimated charges of @xmath165 and @xmath166 in y = ch@xmath1cf@xmath1 .",
    "the fermi surface of the metallic phase of y = ch@xmath1cf@xmath1 has been mapped out using angular - dependent magnetoresistance and magnetic oscillations.@xcite however , the metallic phase differs significantly from a conventional fermi liquid .",
    "first , in contrast to most bedt - ttf metals,@xcite even at a temperature as low as 14 k no drude peak is present in optical conductivity.@xcite second , anomalous properties of the magnetoresistance were recently interpreted in terms of a magnetic field induced superconductor - insulator transition.@xcite the temperature dependence of the penetration depth in the superconducting phase was recently found to go like @xmath167 at low temperatures.@xcite this is inconsistent with an s - wave state , but also deviates significantly from the linear temperature dependence expected for a d - wave state .",
    "the arrangement of the bedt - ttf molecules within a layer of the family @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath5yso@xmath6 are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "table [ table2 ] lists values of the hopping integrals calculated in the hckel approximation .",
    "note that generally the diagonal terms a and a are smaller than the vertical and horizontal terms .",
    "hence , as a first approximation the system can be described by an anisotropic square lattice . however , we note that the main difference between the hopping parameters for the three different anions in table [ table2 ] is that the diagonal terms a and a vary as the anion is changed",
    ". this will change the proximity to the charge ordering instability and so lead to the three different ground states for these materials .",
    "in summary , we have argued that the essential physics of the electronic and magnetic properties of layered molecular crystals of the @xmath0 type can be captured by an extended hubbard model on the square lattice and at quarter filling . for large coulomb repulsion ( @xmath168 ) between nearest neighbours ,",
    "the ground state is a charge - ordered insulator .",
    "antiferromagnetic interactions arise due a novel fourth - order exchange process .",
    "a slave boson treatment was given of the su(n ) generalization of the model .",
    "it was found that for sufficiently small @xmath11 the metallic phase was stable against charge ordering .",
    "we briefly mention the relation of this work to a recent paper of mazumdar , clay , and campbell@xcite .",
    "they have studied the extended hubbard model at quarter filling on an anisotropic square lattice and discuss its relevance to a wide range of organics , but not those considered here .",
    "they argue that in the real materials the nearest - neighbour coulomb repulsion is smaller than the critical value necessary to form the charge ordered state considered here .",
    "coupling to phonons produces an insulating phase with a different kind of charge order ( a bond - order - wave ) .",
    "x - ray scattering experiments which can resolve the charge on individual molecules ( due to different bond lengths ) should be able to distinguish these two different ground states .",
    "there is controversy about whether nuclear magnetic resonance measurements can distinguish these two charge orderings.@xcite the charge distribution observed@xcite for @xmath4-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1sf@xmath5ch@xmath1so@xmath6 is consistent with charge ordering considered here .",
    "we acknowledge that the actual @xmath0 type materials are more complicated than the simplest hubbard model considered here .",
    "for example , along the diagonals of the square lattice ( corresponding to the vertical direction in figure [ fig1 ] ) there is also coulomb repulsion .",
    "in fact , mori@xcite finds the corresponding @xmath2 to be larger than along the horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "seo@xcite has shown how the latter can lead to competition between different charge ordered states ( i.e. , those associated with wave vector @xmath144 and @xmath169 ) .",
    "also , x - ray scattering suggests that in ( bedt - ttf)@xmath1rbm(scn)@xmath12 [ m = co , zn ] there is a structural transition associated with the charge ordering and that this changes the electronic structure in the insulating phase.@xcite however , our view is that the @xmath10 model on the square lattice captures the essential physics and first we need to understand it .",
    "\\(i ) is there superconductivity in the model ?",
    "the idea that proximity to a quantum critical point increases the tendency towards superconducting instabilities is supported by recent experiments on heavy fermion materials.@xcite it was first shown by scalapino , loh , and hirsch@xcite that proximity to a spin - density wave or charge - density wave transition can lead to d - wave superconductivity . in a future publication",
    "we will investigate whether charge fluctuations near the charge ordering transition can produce superconductivity.@xcite    \\(ii ) are charge ordering , the charge gap , and antiferromagnetism destroyed at the same critical value of @xmath11 ?",
    "in section [ afm ] it was shown that for large @xmath11 the ground state has a charge gap , charge ordering , and antiferromagnetism . in section [ slave ]",
    "it was shown that , for @xmath11 less than a critical value , the metallic phase is stable , at least in the large n limit .",
    "it is quite possible that the above three properties disappear at different values of @xmath11 . for the case of the quarter - filled extended hubbard model on a ladder",
    ", numerical calculations found that the charge ordering disappeared below a non - zero value of @xmath11 , but the charge gap did not.@xcite this unusual result may be an artefact of the one - dimensionality of the ladder . for the square lattice ,",
    "this issue will probably be only resolved by careful numerical work .",
    "\\(iii ) does non - fermi liquid behavior occur in the metallic phase near the quantum critical point ?",
    "this is generally expected@xcite and is observed in heavy fermion materials.@xcite slave boson theory has been used to show that in the doped hubbard model near a charge instability the quasi - particle scattering becomes singular leading to anomalous metallic properties.@xcite    we thank m. brunner , r. j. bursill , o. cepas , c. j. hamer , c. j. kepert , r. r. p. singh and j. a. schlueter for helpful discussions .",
