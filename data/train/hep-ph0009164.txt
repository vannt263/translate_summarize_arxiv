    "chacaltaya laboratory offers unique possibility to observe possible imprints of strangelets arriving from the outer space .",
    "they are lumps of strange quark matter ( sqm ) , a new possible stable form of matter ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "following @xcite it is fully sensible to search for strangelets in cosmic ray experiments , especially at chacaltaya level ( @xmath0 g/@xmath1 of atmosphere ) because @xcite the specific features of strangelets @xcite allow them to penetrate deep into atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the point is that there exists some critical size of strangelet given by the critical value of its mass number @xmath2 such that for @xmath3 strangelets are absolutely stable against neutron emission .",
    "( however , small strangelets might probably also gain stability due to the shell effect @xcite . ) . below this limit",
    "strangelets decay rapidly evaporating neutrons .",
    "the geometrical radii of strangelets turn out to be comparable to the radii of ordinary nuclei @xcite , i.e. , their geometrical cross sections are similar to the normal nuclear ones . to account for their strong penetrability one has to accept that strangelets reaching deeply into atmosphere are formed in many successive interactions with air nuclei by the initialy very heavy lumps of sqm entering the atmosphere and decreasing due to the collisions with air nuclei ( until their @xmath4 reaches the critical value @xmath5 @xcite ) .",
    "the opposite scenario advocated recently in @xcite faces some difficulties and will not be discussed here .",
    "such scenario is fully consistent with all present experiments @xcite . in this scenario interaction of strangelet with target nucleus",
    "involves all quarks of the target located in the geometrical intersection of the colliding air nucleus and strangelet .",
    "it is assumed that each quark from the target interacts with only one quark from the strangelet ; i.e. , during interaction the mass number of strangelet is diminished to the value equal to @xmath6 at most .",
    "this procedure continues unles either strangelet reaches earth or ( most probably ) disintegrates at some depth @xmath7 of the atmosphere reaching @xmath8 .",
    "this results , in a first approximation ( in which @xmath9 ) , in total penetration depth of the order of @xmath10 .",
    "the characteristic features of strangelets propagation are illustrated in fig .",
    "all numerical calculations presented here were done using suitable modifications of the showersim @xcite modular software .",
    "strangelets propagation and nuclear - electromagnetic cascades through the atmosphere were simulated with primaries ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and strangelets ) initiating showers sampled from the power spectrum @xmath13 with energies above @xmath14 tev per particle .",
    "eas detected at chacaltaya with @xmath15 were then analysed .",
    "( 14,8 )    fig",
    ". @xmath16 an example of the predicted decrease of the actual size of strangelet @xmath4 with depth @xmath7 of the atmosphere traversed for two different initial sizes : @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( dotted lines correspond to @xmath19 ) .",
    "( b ) number of nucleons released in @xmath20 g/@xmath21 at depth @xmath7 of the atmosphere from the strangelet with mass number ratios @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "there are several reports suggesting existence of direct candidates for sqm @xcite ( characterized mainly by their very small ratios of @xmath23 ) .",
    "all of them have mass numbers @xmath4 near or slightly exceeding @xmath5 ( including centauro event which contains probably @xmath24 baryons @xcite ) .",
    "analysis of these candidates for sqm shows @xcite that the abundance of strangelets in the primary cosmic ray flux is @xmath25 at the same enery per particle .",
    "efficiency for registration of strangelets at chacaltaya level is shown in fig .",
    "2a . to detect strangelets with @xmath26 at chacaltaya the mass of the initial strangelet",
    "should be @xmath27 what leads to @xmath28 as the relative abundance of such strangelets .",
    "for normal flux of primary cosmic rays @xcite the expected flux of strangelets is then equal to @xmath29 m@xmath30h@xmath31sr@xmath31 for the energy above @xmath32 gev per initial strangelet .",
    "the high altitude exposure of passive nuclear track detector arrays @xcite and their operation for one year allow therefore detection of such objects .",
    "in fact , the exposed cr39 detector should detect at least @xmath33 strangelets with masses above @xmath5 and with energies per registered strangelet above @xmath20 gev .",
    "the mass distribution of strangelets , which can be observed at chacaltaya is shown in fig .",
    "( 14,7.8 )    fig .",
    "2 . @xmath16 registration eficiency for strangelet with mass number @xmath3 at the chacaltaya level as funcion of initial mass number @xmath34 .",
    "consecutive full circles indicate ( for @xmath35 ) points where @xmath36 , respectively . @xmath37",
    "mass distribution of strangelets at chacaltaya level ( solid histogram ) resulting from primary mass spectrum @xmath38 ( solid line ) . the corresponding initial mass distribution for detected strangelets",
    "is shown by dotted histogram .",
    "experimental results obtained at chacaltaya show a wide spectrum of exotic events ( centauros , superfamilies with halo , strongly penetrating component , etc . ) which are clearly incompatible with the standard ideas of hadronic interactions known from the accelerator experiments . some new mechanism or new primaries are therefore needed . assuming that strangelets represent such new primaries one is able to explain @xcite ( at least to some extend ) a strong penetrating nature of some ` abnormal ' cascades associated with their very slow attenuation and with the apperance of many maxima with small distances between them ( about @xmath39 times smaller than in the normal hadron cascades ) .",
    "already mentioned centauro ( and mini - centauro ) events , characterized by the extreme imbalance between hadronic and gamma - ray components among produced secondaries , are probably the best known examples of such exotic events .",
    "they require deeply penetrating component in cosmic rays .",
    "we claim that they can be products of strangelets penetrating deeply into atmosphere and evaporating neutrons @xcite .",
    "both the flux ratio of centauros registered at different depths and the energy distribution within them can be successfully described by such concept .",
    "another example of exotic event is phenomenon of alignment of structural objects of gamma - hadron families near a stright line in the plane at the target diagram @xcite .",
    "the excess of aligned families observed is incompatible with any conventional concept of interaction .",
    "one can speculate therefore that it is caused by the arrival of strangelets with high spin ( @xmath40 ) gradually dispersing their masses @xmath41 when propagating through the atmosphere .",
    "anomalous events have been reconfirmed by measuring extensive air showers ( eas ) @xcite . among them",
    "was the striking observation @xcite of extremely long - delayed neutrons in conjection with the large eas which can not be explained by the known mechanism of hadronic cascades development",
    ". also muon bundles of extremaly high multiplicity observed recently by aleph detector ( in the dedicated cosmic - ray run ) can orginate from strangelets collisions with the atmosphere @xcite . as an illustration of sensitivity of eas characteristics on primary strangelets we shown in fig . 3 our predictions the corresponding distributions of hadrons and muons in eas detected at chacaltaya .",

    "4 . @xmath16 the expected flux ( our results ) of strangelets compared with the upper experimental limit , compiled by price @xcite , and predicted astrophysical limits : big bang estimation comes from nucleosynthesis with quark nuggets formation ; dark matter one comes from local flux assuming that galactic halo density is given solely by quark nuggets .",
    "@xmath37 comparision of the estimated mass spectrum @xmath44 for strangelets with the known abundance of elements in the universe @xcite .",
    "the experimental data mentiond before lead to the flux of strangelets which is consistent ( cf .",
    "4a ) with the astrophysical limits and with the upper limits given experimentally @xcite .",
    "it follows the @xmath45 behaviour , which coincides with the behaviour of abundance of normal nuclei in the universe ( fig .",
    "4b ) @xcite .",
    "the fascinating subject of searches for strangelets as a new form of matter can be succesfully realised at experiments located in the mountain region of chacaltaya .",
    "interpretation of indirect observations ( anomalous events observed in emulsion chambers and results from the measurements of eas ) can provide signals of strangelets . moreover , direct identification ( by implementing passive nuclear track detector arrays ) of sqm is quite realistic in the near future .",
    "all these justifies interest in further experimental search for the sqm and for its cosmological and elementary particle physics aspects .",
