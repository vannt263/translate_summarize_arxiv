    "after the discovery of helium superfluidity by kapitza and allen independently @xcite , london @xcite proposed that this novel phenomenon could be a consequence of the bose - einstein condensation(bec ) predicted by einstein in 1925 @xcite .",
    "london himself calculated the critical temperature of a 3d ideal bose gas with mass and density equal to that of helium four ; the critical temperature obtained is 3.2 k , which is very close to the temperature at which helium four becomes superfluid , i.e. , 2.17 k. this result feed the idea that helium superfluidity was motivated by a bec of the helium atoms .",
    "however , the specific heat of helium four near absolute zero temperature had been observed and measured @xcite to increase exponentially with temperature which is not expected for a 3d ideal bose gas whose specific heat increases proportional to @xmath1 . to reproduce this exponential behavior with temperature , an artificial gap in the dispersion relation",
    "was introduced @xcite .",
    "although the exponential behavior is reproduced for low temperatures , the critical temperature increases beyond the bose - einstein critical temperature when the energy gap increases .",
    "this behavior is contrary to what is observed in helium , where the interaction reduces the superfluidity critical temperature below the 3d bec critical temperature when the density is that of liquid helium four .",
    "although many theoretical efforts @xcite have been made to justify the gap as a result of interactions among the particles , the gap not only has not showed up but there are arguments against its existence @xcite .",
    "now days , when it is possible to reproduce almost any space lattice structure trapping fermions or bosons in the laboratory , we consider relevant to reconsider the surface effect on the dispersion relation of quantum particles placed in optical periodic lattices which simulate crystalline solids . many year ago , after the publication of the kronig - penney model @xcite for an infinite solid , tamm @xcite discussed the finite size effect on the particle energy spectrum using a semi - infinite idealized one - dimensional crystal .",
    "tamm reported the occurrence of an isolated energy level for each allowed energy band . these isolated surface level",
    "are called tamm s surface states .    in this article",
    "we return to the london s idea to introduce a gap in the energy spectrum of bosons but keeping in mind the existence of tamm surface states , to give details of the energy gap effects on the bose - einstein critical temperature , its isochoric specific heat as a function of temperature as well as the its specific heat jump at @xmath2 .    in sec .",
