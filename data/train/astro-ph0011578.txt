    "a growing number of snrs ( listed in table 1 ) are thought to show evidence for synchrotron x - rays , for a variety of reasons .",
    "most are suspected of nonthermal x - rays because they show hard energy excesses that can be fit with powerlaws .",
    "a few ( sn  1006 , g347.3 - 0.5 ) have nearly featureless x - ray spectra which are clearly dominated by nonthermal emission . some remnants ,",
    "while not dominated by nonthermal emission in the asca band , show other evidence pointing to its presence .",
    "osse observations of cassiopeia a at 400 - 1250 kev ( the 1996 ) are well described by a broken power law , steepening to higher energies ( allen 1997 ) .",
    "rcw 86 is an especially interesting case .",
    "it shows anomalously low abundances when fit with thermal models ( vink 1997 ) , but the addition of a synchrotron model bring the abundances to within expected ranges ( borkowski 2001 ) .    the most straightforward explanation for nonthermal x - ray emission ( non - plerionic in these snrs ) is synchrotron emission from the same mechanism that is responsible for the radio emission .",
    "it is straightforward to determine the synchrotron spectrum from the electron energy population however , the extrapolation from the radio spectrum measured by single dish instruments , over - predicts the x - ray flux ( see figure 1 )  there must be a mechanism that causes the electron population to roll off at the highest energies .",
    "reynolds & chevalier ( 1981 ) attributed this rolloff to synchrotron losses .    the sharpest physically plausible spectral rolloff would be the emission resulting from an exponential cutoff of the electron power - law energy distribution , radiating in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "this was embodied in the xspec model _ srcut _ and used by reynolds & keohane ( 1999 ) to set limits on the energies to which snrs could accelerate electrons ( with implications for cosmic ray ions ) .",
    "a more sophisticated treatment requires addressing the mechanism limiting electrons at the highest energies .",
    "the cutoff could be due to the age of the snr , radiative losses from synchrotron or inverse - compton emission , or electron escape(reynolds 1998 ) .",

    "the escape - limited model is a single parameter model that is particularly well suited to x - ray analysis programs such as xspec , and has been released as _",
    "sresc _ in xspec 11 ( it should also be available for chandra data analysis in ciao 2.1 ) .",
    "this model uses the sedov solution to specify the electron distribution and assumes a uniform upstream magnetic field , with a shock compression ratio of 4 .",
    "the model takes the radio spectral index and 1 ghz flux as inputs ( available from green 2000 for galactic snrs and now for some magellanic cloud snrs in williams 2000 ) and fits one parameter , the rolloff frequency  proportional to the product of the maximum mhd wavelength scattering the electrons and the magnetic field strength .",
    "we have applied _ sresc _ to archival observations of the integrated asca spectrum of sn 1006 as a test case .",
    "as well as describing the physics behind the emission the sresc model is much better constrained for fitting purposes than a powerlaw model .",
    "the synchrotron model allows more accurate abundance determinations in the thermal emission  these abundances are close to predictions for type ia sn ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) and include half a solar mass of iron .",
    "since tev detections can be used to determine the relativistic electron density in sn 1006 , fitting the rolloff frequency with the sresc model uniquely determines the magnetic field .",
    "this suggests that sn  1006 is in fact far from equipartition , violating a common assumption for astrophysical plasmas .",
    "the model also makes spatial predictions and is capable of reproducing the morphology of sn 1006 at energies at which it is dominated by nonthermal emission , shown in figure 2 .",
    "however , a much more stringent test of the model is to apply it to spatially resolved spectra from sn 1006 .",
    "as shown in figure 2 we have developed subsets of the escape - limited synchrotron model for different regions of the supernova remnant , describing the polar caps , the limbs and the center .",
    "these models predict slightly different curvature for the nonthermal emission in each region for a particular rolloff energy .",
    "the models should allow us to make more accurate determinations of the abundances as well as mapping the thermal and nonthermal distribution across the remnant .",
    "preliminary results have been very promising .",
    "contrary to expectation , all regions of sn 1006 have a significant amount of nonthermal emission , including the polar caps and center which have been fit in the past with thermal - only models .",
    "the limbs are dominated by nonthermal emission but require a thermal component while fits to the thermally dominated center will tolerate a significant amount of nonthermal emission .",
    "in addition we find that the north limb and south limb will not support the identical thermal and nonthermal models  we find the spectra to be detectably different .",
    "we have found , both in integrated and spatially resolved models , that the measured abundances and temperature change with the addition of accurate synchrotron models . in the future ,",
    "accurate accounting for a possible nonthermal component will be a necessary precondition to using nucleosynthesis model predictions to interpret abundances in any snr .",
    "_ srcut _ and _ sresc _ , new models in xspec 11 , accurately describe this emission and are a substantial improvement over powerlaw models both in terms of physical description and fitting .",
    "all regions of sn 1006 , even the polar caps which show obvious thermal lines , seem to have significant nonthermal emission .",
    "we also find that the spectra of the north and the south limb are not identical .",
    "while most of the emission from the center does seem to be thermal , the fit can tolerate a significant amount of nonthermal emission .",
    "technology is surpassing theory ",
    "chandra arcsecond - resolution observations of snrs including sn  1006 will soon be available , requiring models capable of describing extremely small scale variations",
    ". these synchrotron models will be useful both for analyzing higher resolution observations of sn  1006 , and for interpreting other snrs with nonthermal x - ray emission ."
