    "in any course of undergraduate thermodynamics , thermodynamical cycles and their efficiencies hardly miss their parts .",
    "the discussion of thermodynamical cycles is always followed by , or is parallel to , the discussion of the second law of thermodynamics . for a reversible cycle between two single temperatures ,",
    "it is well - known that the efficiency @xmath0 of such cycle is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the absolute temperatures of hot and cold heat reservoirs . for an irreversible cycle , since the total change of entropy is positive , the efficiency of such cycle is less than ( [ efficiency ] ) .",
    "there are many theoretical cycles that satisfy the efficiency ( [ efficiency ] )  @xcite , but the so - called _ carnot cycle _ is of interest because of its simple manner in describing a reversible cycle .",
    "the carnot cycle consists of two isothermal processes and two adiabatic processes as shown in . in most textbooks of either elementary physics or thermodynamics , the carnot efficiency ( [ efficiency ] )",
    "is derived with the ideal gas as its working substance because of its mathematical simplicity using the following customary procedure : _ calculating the heats involved in isothermal expansion and compression in @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 diagrams , then relating them with the associated adiabatic relations_. however , the second law of thermodynamics proves that the efficiency ( [ efficiency ] ) should be independent of working substance  @xcite , so it is natural to question whether the carnot efficiency can be obtained from other equations of state using the procedure above .",
    "some attempt has been made to do the task above , among them is the work of agrawal and menon  @xcite who used the van der waals equation of state to derive the carnot efficiency through the procedure above , and it turned out that their result agreed with ( [ efficiency ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , they pointed out that there were some calculation difficulties arising when the derivation was done for other real gases equations of state ( such as the redlich - kwong gas  @xcite ) using the same procedure , and suggested to derive eq.([efficiency ] ) through an infinitesimal cycle using a suitable taylor expansion of thermodynamic variables about the initial state of the cycle  @xcite .",
