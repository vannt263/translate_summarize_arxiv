    "on the onset of global ecological crisis questions related to regulation technologies and safe handling of environmental resources become urgent .",
    "the equilibrium between the economic growth and environmental variables is an actual problem of every government .",
    "the environmental science must deal with the task how to design robust sensorial nets and control systems to manage the balance between the immediate economic needs and the long - time perspectives of mankind .",
    "there are several instruments for control and decrease the local and global pollution rate : energy taxation , pollution rights and introduction of cleaner technologies . unfortunately , direct and naive application of these approaches does not result relevant emission reductions .",
    "enforcing pollution rights is difficult and has high administrative costs  @xcite . as an example can serve the multi - country control model of international coordination of emission charges and pollution trading  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite pollution trading may result a non - cooperative equilibrium with high pollution rates .",
    "it is often argued that if the only tool of policy is the energy taxation it may cause the loss of the competitiveness between firms .",
    "moreover , the tax rate which is be able to stabilize the emissions would be too high to be economically and politically acceptable . because of energy taxation and network effects in society , the firms tend to delay adoption to cleaner technologies  @xcite .",
    "all these unexpected emergent regulatory effects stimulated our interest about the problem of dynamics of emissions that can be seen as a consequence of the competitive interaction of the environmental and economical ( acquisition ) agents .",
    "a key principle we applied to define a robust environmental policy is the feedback mechanism . in general , the nonlinear feedback is one of the key up - bottom mechanism that enables to keep control over the dynamics of complex systems .",
    "the mechanism has been exploited in many different systems .",
    "the problem discussed in  ref.@xcite is focused to the feedback localization of the parametric boundary between periodicity and chaos generated by a logistic map .",
    "stabilization of dynamical regimes via feedback appears in the simulations of investments  ref.@xcite . in  ref.@xcite model",
    "has been suggested , where the speculative market expectations are linked via the positive feedback to the prevailing price trend .",
    "as stated in  ref.@xcite , the steady _ self - organized critical _ ( soc ) regime  ref.@xcite implies the operation of inherent feedback mechanism that ensures a steady state marginally stable against disturbances .",
    "it is important here to note that _ criticality _ is accompanied by the absence of characteristic scale of the _ power - law distributions _ of avalanches . according",
    "ref.@xcite the nonlinear feedback allows to transform the models of the `` unstable '' phase transitions ( i.e. classic models ) to soc models . in the works devoted to self - adjusted monte carlo methods  ref.@xcite ,",
    "the feedback which drives the physical system to a critical regime is expressed in terms of estimated statistical averages .",
    "additionally , catastrophic environmental collapses in consumption / pollution feedback models were described in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present feedback control distributed over the population of autonomous sensing mobile agents that control the behavior of factory agents .    as usual , the thinking about distributed control is motivated by the expected robustness against accidental failures .",
    "nevertheless , most of agent systems face to the general problem of agency that is the imperfect incentives  @xcite to satisfy the global goal function of system .",
    "our motivation is to show , that this property of distributed agent system may drive the environment to a critical state with extremal emission ratio .",
    "the idea of walking sensorial agents in our model is very similar to the idea of distributed pollution sensing by pigeon bloggers proposed by de costa  ref.@xcite , where pigeon agents are equipped by communication chips and sensors for carbon monoxide .",
    "similar idea had been reported as a concept of randomly walking sensors for detection of dynamically changing gradient sources  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as it follows . in the next section",
    "the multi - agent ecological model is introduced . in section sec.[numres ] the results of numerical study are discussed .",
    "finally the conclusions are presented .",
    "the first point we consider is the dynamics of diffusive emissions of factory agents .",
    "the base substance of model is a square lattice with dimension @xmath0 which represents the physical space for emission spreading .",
    "the factories are located on random lattice sites and the spatial distribution of their emissions is directed by discrete rule of diffusion . for this purpose",
    ", we implement a cellular automaton ( ca ) based on integer rules .",
    "our suggestion for computation of diffusion is partially inspired by the lattice gas models of pollutants  ref.@xcite .",
    "however , we preferred formulation where the concentration field on lattice sites varies via the recursive rule @xmath1 that replaces in one time step @xmath2 the @xmath3 `` integer pieces '' of emission at the position @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the emission inflow caused by the factory agents @xmath5 is discussed in below  eq.([ifeq2 ] ) the emission current between the nearest neighbor cells @xmath6_{\\rm int }    +   \\sum_{{\\bf r}\\in { \\rm nn}({\\bf r } ) } \\ ,    [ \\ , m(t,{\\bf r})/5 ] _",
    "{ \\rm int}\\,\\ , ,    \\label{cure2}\\ ] ] where the brackets @xmath7_{\\rm int}$ ] denote the integer part of argument and @xmath8 refers to the four nearest neighboring sites of @xmath9 .",
    "eq.([inn ] ) preserves the total emission for transitions between the lattice sites .",
    "other words , the natural purification of emission is absent , emissions are exclusively depleted by the outflow through opened lattice bounds . for @xmath10",
    "the mass equidistribution of emissions becomes satisfied with @xmath11 order . under these conditions , @xmath12 acts as 2d laplace of @xmath13 , and",
    "thus ca rules describe the stylized diffusive transport .",
    "the local concentration of emissions is permanently monitored by @xmath14 number of _",
    "sensing agents_. the sensing agents are random walkers with the lattice positions @xmath15 , @xmath16 $ ] , @xmath17 , @xmath14 . the lattice position of the @xmath18th walker is given by @xmath19_{\\bmod l}\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber { s _ { y } } ( t+1,j ) & =    & [ s _ { y } ( t , j ) + s _ { y}(t , j)]_{\\bmod l}\\,;\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the shift @xmath20 $ ] is chosen randomly from the set of four unit vectors @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "eq.([walker ] ) preserves the periodic boundary conditions for @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , we checked that the statistical dependencies studied in this paper do not change remarkably for closed boundary conditions .",
    "the source of emissions are the _ factory agents _ localized at random positions @xmath26 , @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "they are characterized by an integer value of emission production @xmath29 .",
    "the condition of sensorial feedback system is that over a predetermined local pollution threshold @xmath30 every sensorial agent with @xmath31 sends a feedback request to the nearest  ( in the euclidean sense ) factory @xmath32 @xmath33 the concentration threshold @xmath30 is analogous to that in  ref.@xcite where the feedback operation is mediated by the chemical sensors with specific thresholds for different pollutants .",
    "any request of sensorial agent instantly decreases the local emission production @xmath29 of the @xmath34th factory by a constant additive factor @xmath35 . in the absence of feedback signal , to satisfy economic needs , the factory increases its production automatically .",
    "both alternatives are described by the equation @xmath36 the eventuality @xmath37 ( zero emission means no production ) yields the bankruptcy of @xmath38 and the appearance of a new factory at random position with initial production @xmath39 .",
    "the zero initial emission assure that new factory may start its production only when it survives at least one time period without feedback request .",
    "the total number of factories is conserved by the death - birth rules . since the production strategies of new generation of factories does not change",
    ", the implicit assumption here is that system is locked to the inferior technology  @xcite .    what remains unspecified in eq.([dif2 ] ) is the emission inflow caused by the @xmath40 type of agents @xmath41 it is worth nothing that all the agent systems in common with ca subsystem are updated synchronously .",
    "the asynchronous update rules can be also of interest , but we dismiss them from our considerations .    after the completion of the agent - based model , its relationship to the standard sandpile model of soc  @xcite should be noted .",
    "the level of emissions is confronted with a threshold which is similar to the height ( slope ) threshold in soc models . in sandpile models",
    "if the height of a pile exceeds a given threshold , a `` signal '' is transmitted to the central site and to its neighboring sites .",
    "the abundant grains are then toppled from the center .",
    "spatial expansion of a sandpile avalanche corresponds to the emission spreading around a factory agent .",
    "the power - law distribution of avalanches in sandpile model is a consequence of the local conservation of sand grains .",
    "the property coincide with the conservation of emissions , but contradicts to the non - local conservation of factory agents .",
    "the opened boundary conditions for emissions are also borrowed from the sandpile model .",
    "the simulations have been performed for lattices @xmath42 . to avoid the influence of transients , the initial @xmath43 updates per site were discarded ;",
    "about @xmath44 updates have been used to collect information about the steady - state for the fixed parameters @xmath45 . in",
    "further we limit ourselves to the systems with @xmath46 . in the world with large number of sensors @xmath14 the emissions fluctuate around @xmath30 .",
    "this oversaturated population of the sensors prevents from unbearable contamination but yields a non - efficient economy .",
    "much different is the situation for @xmath14 small , where the steady - state regime become unstable since the rate of emissions diverges in time .",
    "the dynamics corresponds to a catastrophic regime .",
    "the preliminary numerical work on steady - state statistics yields the conclusion that @xmath3 is remarkably lowered at the corners of @xmath47 lattice world with opened bounds .",
    "such inhomogeneity induces secondary effect of the accumulation of factories at boundary regions . as @xmath48 increases",
    ", the overall contribution of corners decays faster than the contribution of edges . in this context",
    ", the important is the aspect of finite - size scaling carried out in the next section .",
    "the outcome of our simulation experience is the decision to accumulate the statistics of those factories that have received even one feedback request during the step @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we define the following order parameter @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the temporal average calculated over @xmath51 epochs . if source @xmath38 received a feedback signal @xmath52 and @xmath53 otherwise .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the @xmath14 dependencies of @xmath54 that attain abrupt jump interpreted as a discontinuous transition form the safe ( nondestructive ) to the destructive economy .",
    "moreover , we found that @xmath14 dependencies of @xmath54 collapse onto the single finite - size scaling form @xmath55 with exponents @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "the algebraic combination @xmath58 , where the scaling function @xmath59 attains the jump @xmath60 and @xmath54 tends to the @xmath61 asymptotics , is interpreted as a critical point . for given @xmath62",
    "we have estimated @xmath63 .",
    "for sufficiently small lattices ( @xmath64 ) the scaling violation is indicated .",
    "the problem with sensorial system manifests itself when @xmath65 . in this regime",
    "a sensor multiply affects the same nearest factory and lowers its emission production , while other hidden sources , maybe more influential and dangerous polluters , could left without feedback requests .",
    "hereafter , this process is referred as _",
    "spatial screening_. the screening emerges as a result of _ co - evolution _ and _ self - organization _ in multi - agent system .",
    "the statistical significance of the screening is clarified in fig.[fig2 ] where the auxiliary order parameter @xmath66 is plotted against @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68 when the request comes from the @xmath18th sensorial agent , @xmath69 otherwise . at the critical point",
    "@xmath70 both the order parameters attain discontinuous jump .",
    "the ratio @xmath71 reflects the _ screening _ efficiency which at the critical point reads @xmath72 .",
    "the proportionality @xmath73 reveals the interpretation of the index @xmath74 .",
    "the difference @xmath75 reflects the impact of the screening as well as the most pronounced situation at @xmath76 .",
    "the vicinity of criticality is corroborated by the broad - scale statistics of production rates ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) .",
    "we see that the most pronounced power - law dependence belongs to @xmath77 . in the economic models",
    "ref.@xcite , the emission rates are usually related to the overall production of goods with a proportionality factor called emission - output ratio .",
    "standard and widely accepted assumption is that this ratio is fixed and irrespective to the investments in clean technology . with such idealization",
    ", the critical fluctuations of @xmath29 can be assigned to the empirical zipf s law . as we see from fig.[fig4 ] , the cumulative probability distribution function @xmath78 corresponding to ( @xmath79)- parametric domain have been characterized by the effective exponents within the broad range @xmath80 .",
    "it means that feedback mechanism we proposed is not sufficient to fix the realistic exponents of the zipf s law ( according ref.@xcite the empirical exponents are @xmath81 ; @xmath82 ) .    since the place for new factory is chosen randomly , the snapshots showing the spatial distributions of @xmath40 agents evoke the images of the short - range ordered molecular patterns . from this perspective the system of factories have features of 2d molecular liquid or `` vapor '' . within such viewpoint",
    "the `` vapor '' of @xmath38 agents prepared for @xmath83 belongs to the safe economy , whereas stronger correlated `` liquid condensate '' ( @xmath65 ) corresponds to the catastrophic regime . in",
    "further , these arguments are applied in favor of scenario of discontinuous transition .     as a function of sensorial agent density @xmath84 scaled by @xmath85 factor .",
    "the simulation was performed for different @xmath48 with fixed density of factories @xmath86 . , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    [ scale_all1 ]     scaled by @xmath85 factor for @xmath87 .",
    "the other parameters as in fig.1.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    [ difag ]     for @xmath88 .",
    "the boundary power - law regime ( @xmath89 ) is the most pronounced .",
    "thereupon for @xmath90 the dynamics has no steady state and steady - state distributions do not exist.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    [ scale ]     obtained for different @xmath48 and @xmath91 the inset table lists the effective exponents @xmath92.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    , @xmath93 .",
    "the averaged inter - replica distance @xmath94 [ see eq.([demspr2 ] ) ] is plotted versus @xmath95 .",
    "the position of the critical point coincides with fig.[fig1 ] within the statistical error . , scaledwidth=70.0% ]     ( for @xmath87 ) .",
    "the interval ( @xmath96 ) approximately delimits the fast ca purification through the opened bounds .",
    "the steady - state becomes formed above @xmath97 ( above the crossing point).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the transition concept is examined in further ( in a manner that is independent of @xmath98 ) via damage spreading  ( ds ) method ref.@xcite .",
    "the ds is based on the comparative analysis of simultaneously evolving replicas .",
    "let us consider the pair of the systems i , ii with equal number of agents . at certain time @xmath2 the copy ii",
    "is replicated from i and , consequently , single grain of the emission ( damage ) is added to its randomly chosen cell @xmath99 : @xmath100 the subsequent @xmath101 time steps are executed with the identical sequences of random numbers for updating of the both of replicas i and ii .",
    "the whole process starting from the configuration given by eq.([ini2 ] ) is repeated many times .",
    "the idea of ds is to look for averages @xmath102 of the hamming distance @xmath103 where @xmath104 . in fig.[fig5 ] we show @xmath105 calculated as an average taken over the @xmath106 steps of the steady - state .",
    "it is seen that ds technique confirms @xmath67-driven transition @xmath70 maintained previously by the direct inspection of @xmath107 dependence .",
    "next , the system is studied via nonequilibrium relaxation method@xcite that is an efficient tool of analysis of equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "the numerical results are shown in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "the initial configuration has been prepared in a such way that at the beginning , the factories are generated at random positions .",
    "subsequently , the emissions have been left to increase freely without control .",
    "after the level @xmath108 is reached , the sensors become active . the resulting relaxation dependence",
    "is then constructed by averaging over 1000 repetitions of the whole relaxation process .",
    "we found that relaxation strongly depends on how far @xmath67 is from @xmath109 .",
    "three distinct dynamical regimes have been identified when inspecting averaged relaxation process . in early stage of development",
    "practically all sensors are active since @xmath110 .",
    "later , when content of the most of cells are still above @xmath30 , relatively fast exponential relaxation dominates .",
    "it corresponds to the purification through bounds .",
    "as it can be clearly seen , the processes at large times are well separated from the initial relaxation .",
    "the long - time process is associated with the positional adjustment ( or self - organization ) of the factories .",
    "the statistical properties of the multi - agent system including the environmental - economic interactions have been studied .",
    "it should be noted that at early stages of the work we were motivated by the particular hypothesis about implementation of feedback and direct generation of soc regime .",
    "however , even preliminary runs have uncovered that not all the regimes conducted by feedback acquire soc signatures as are the power - law distributions and power - law autocorrelation functions . with these facts in mind ,",
    "we shift our focus to give an interpretation in terms of phase transitions ( `` unstable '' in sense of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "our simulation confirmed that only optimized feedback induces attractiveness of the critical state .",
    "in other words , the distributed feedback ( as many other approaches ) does not automatically guarantees the attractiveness of critical point .",
    "the agents proposed here hold only rudimentary thinking and thus more intelligent entities should be considered in future work .",
    "a variety of problems can be formulated where the establishment of new factory is subjected to a place - search optimization strategy . with such modification the formation of",
    "highly correlated _ factory - sensorial agent _ structures are expected .",
    "one can extend the idea to models with crystal - like ordering and formation of the compact aggregates of factories - industrial complexes enhancing the effect of screening .",
    "an alternative representation of distributed feedback mechanism may be the notion of individual energy taxation of factories which is proportional to the local contamination level .",
    "contrary to plethora of possible additional realistic entries omitted , the hypothesis posed by simulation is that the phase transition appears to be a generic statistical aspect of the groups of autonomous agents with conflicting interests .",
    "the main implication from the present model is the identification of power - law  ( nearly catastrophic ) pdf s of fluctuations of emission rates .",
    "we believe that focus to power - law distributions will open new perspectives of the environmental diagnostics ."
