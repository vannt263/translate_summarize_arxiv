    "in this paper we analyze the effect of two modelling approaches , stochastic programming ( sp ) and robust optimization ( ro ) , to a supply planning problem under uncertainty .",
    "stochastic programming and robust optimization are considered two alternative techniques to deal with uncertain data both in a single period and in a multi - period decision making process .",
    "the main difficulty associated with the former is the need to provide the probability distribution functions of the underlying stochastic parameters .",
    "this requirement creates a heavy burden to the user because in many real - world situations , such information is unavailable or hard to obtain ( see for example @xcite and @xcite ) . on the other side ro addresses the uncertain nature of the problem without making specific assumptions on probability distributions :",
    "the uncertain parameters are assumed to belong to a deterministic uncertainty set .",
    "the drawback of this approach is the potentially strong dependence of the solution on the rather arbitrarily chosen uncertainty set .",
    "ro adopts a min - max approach that addresses uncertainty by guaranteeing the feasibility and optimality of the solution against all instances of the parameters within the uncertainty set @xcite . a vast literature about the hypotheses that have to be imposed on the structure of the uncertainty set in order to have computationally tractable problems are available ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for polyhedral uncertainty sets and @xcite for ellipsoidal uncertainty sets . the original ro model deals with static problems where all the decision variables have to be determined before any of the uncertain parameters are realized .",
    "this is not the typical situation in most problems that are multi - period in nature , and where a decision at any period can and should account for data realizations in previous periods .",
    "an extension of robust optimization to a dynamic framework was analyzed in @xcite and many others via the concept of adjustable robust counterpart ( arc ) and affinely adjustable robust counterpart ( aarc ) , where part of the decision variables , the so - called adjustable variables , have to be determined after a portion of the uncertain data is realized . in the case of aarc",
    "the dependence of the adjustable variables on the realized data is represented by an affine function .",
    "the introduction of aarc is motivated by the fact that in most of the cases the arc approach is computationally intractable .",
    "comparing sp and ro methods considering a cost - based approach is somehow unilateral .",
    "the philosophy of the two approaches to deal with uncertainty is completely different indeed .",
    "the ro approach is well - suited to the cases where the optimizer wants to hedge the result against all imaginable outcomes of the uncertain events .",
    "such methods can be successfully implemented usually only in the cases where the hedging against rare events is cheap or at least at low cost with respect to possible consequences . on the other side ,",
    "the sp approach includes the probabilistic information about the events into consideration . as a consequence ,",
    "less probable events are counted only with small weights implying less conservative and , in many cases , cheaper solutions .",
    "as drawback , we have a risk of appearance of rare but expensive events which can result in high actual costs if such an `` unhappy '' event is realized .    to make a fair comparison between the above approaches we consider a _ scenario - based framework _ ,",
    "which does not just compare the different solution approaches in terms of costs ; it compares the costs of implementing the non - adjustable ( or first - stage ) solutions obtained using the information available up to now , with sp or ro .",
    "the adjustable variables are then determined when the uncertainty is revealed by solving a deterministic problem .",
    "this heuristic methodology allows also to overcome the typical problem of computational intractability of arc and can be applied to any optimization problem affected by uncertainty .",
    "the efficiency of the methodology has been illustrated on a supply planning problem to optimize vehicle - renting and procurement transportation activities to satisfy demand in several destinations out of several origins .",
    "uncertainty on demands and cost of extra vehicles is considered .",
    "the problem consists in determining the number of vehicles to book , at the end of each time period , from each plant of the set of suppliers , to replenish a certain good at factories in order to minimize the total cost , given by the sum of the transportation costs from origin to destinations ( including the discount for vehicles booked but not used ) and the cost of buying units of product from external sources in case of inventory shortage at the destinations .",
    "we formulate and solve the problem as a two - stage stochastic programming model and as robust optimization models with different uncertainty sets where scenarios of demand and buying costs are built on historical data . since the demand of goods is in general highly affected by the economic conditions , a reliable forecast and reasonable estimates of probability distributions are difficult to obtain .",
    "furthermore , the supply - planning company would avoid to negotiate the quantity of vehicles with the suppliers every time period , being immunized against every possible demand realization allowing to save a lot of operational activities .",
    "this motivates us to consider besides the sp approach , also ro approaches and to quantify the value ( or extra - cost ) of ro guarantees .",
    "first we consider static approaches where the uncertain parameters belong to box or box - ellipsoidal uncertainty sets , and then dynamic approaches , via the concept of arc with scenario generated uncertainty set and scenario - based framework methodology .",
    "a robust solution at the tactical level allows to find a feasible solution for the operational planning problem for each possible realization of demand in the uncertainty set considered .",
    "both sp and ro allow to determine the nonadjustable variables , i.e. , the number of vehicles to book at the end of each time period , using the information available at that time . as new information on demand and buying costs from external sources become available , the adjustable ( or recourse ) decision variables have to be determined .",
    "we describe five strategies for updating the adjustable variables given the values of the already determined values of the nonadjustable variables .",
    "the methodology allows to quantify the cost saving of the sp approach compared to the ro , as well as the value of a more conservative strategy avoiding a negotiation of the number of vehicles every period with the suppliers or third - party service providers ( 3pl ) .",
    "numerical experiments through the scenario - based framework allow a fair comparison in real instances inspired by a gypsum replenishment problem of an italian cement factory producer .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : stochasticversusrobustoptimization ] introduces basic concepts about stochastic and robust optimization .",
    "a scenario - based framework used to compare the two approaches is presented in section [ sec : ascenariobasedframeworkforcomparisonofmodellingapproachesunderuncertainty ] while section [ spuu ] describes the supply planning problem .",
    "section [ models ] discusses the two - stage stochastic programming formulation , robust formulations and the scenario based framework for comparison .",

    "freight transportation @xcite is one of todays most important logistic activities that influences the performance of many other economic activities .",
    "the two most important factors for having high performance level are the economic efficiency and the service quality .",
    "the former relates to the facts that those firms that make use of freight transportation service want to move the right amount of goods at the best cost .",
    "the latter highlights the importance of the quality of service , i.e. being able to satisfy clients demand of a good eventually avoiding inventory costs . bolstering one almost certainly causes the other to suffer : for example , if one lowers his / her inventory to reduce costs , it will become difficult to meet varying customer demand . if one increases safety stock to meet peak demands , one could wind up with a great deal of excess inventory with nowhere to sell it , see @xcite .",
    "traditionally , two prevailing supply chain strategies have dominated the industry : push and pull . however , new technologies , have enabled the creation of a third strategy , a hybrid push - pull model that offers the best of both worlds without their corresponding disadvantages , see @xcite .",
    "the problem of transporting goods or resources from a set of supply points ( production plants ) to a set of demand points ( destination factories or customers ) is an important component of the planning activity of a manufacturing firm .",
    "a particular case is given by the so - called single - sink transportation problem , in which a single retailer is served by a set of suppliers .",
    "this problem has been extensively studied , in particular when the total cost is given by the sum of a variable transportation cost and a fixed charge cost to use the supplier ( @xcite ) .",
    "critical parameters such as customer demands , row material prices and resource capacity are quite uncertain in real problems . an important issue is then represented by the decision on quantities to acquire and store at each destination factory before actual demands reveal themselves .",
    "this is involved in the tactical planning @xcite of the firm supply chain operations . in this paper",
    "we are dealing with a tactical planning problem of a firm supply chain operations , where decision on quantities to acquire and store at each destination factory before actual demands reveal themselves have to be chosen .",
    "detailed information on the capacity of transportation vehicles , capacity of origin plants and destination warehouse are given .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for differences among planning levels , strategic , tactical and operational ones .",
    "example of strategic models are those for designing physical networks and their evolutions , for location of the main facilities of a plant , for resource acquisition , for defining tariff policies .",
    "they usually involve long - term investment decision and strategic policies and they deal with planning at international , national and regional levels .",
    "tactical planning problems modeling works over a medium term horizon for a rational and efficient allocation of existing resources in order to enhance the performance of the whole system .",
    "they usually incorporate seasonal changes in the data and not daily information : vehicle routing models belong to this class of models . on the other hand ,",
    "the notion of cost is central to the operational planning model and it may have different components related to different events that may happen at the decision time ( scarcity of goods at the origin , full capacity at destinations , delay , risk , etc . ) see @xcite .",
    "the significance of uncertainty has prompted a number of works addressing random parameters in tactical level supply chain planning involving distribution of raw material and products ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "nowadays firms are engaged in a continuous procurement process and collaboration with their supply chain partners .",
    "the firm regularly orders products from suppliers in a given area according to inventory , forecasted demand and inventory policy @xcite .",
    "firms may negotiate directly with carriers but very often they deal with a third - party logistic service provider ( 3pl ) @xcite . in the recent past ,",
    "3pl , also referred to as logistics outsourcing ( e.g. @xcite ) , has received considerable attention due to a steadily increasing number of companies across industry sectors using third - party providers for the management of their logistics operations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the functions performed by the third party can encompass the entire logistics process or selected activities within that process @xcite .",
    "the 3pl combines goods into containers or trucks ensuring shipping usually with a fixed schedule .",
    "the firm needs to book in advance sufficient capacity to satisfy the demand leading to a negotiation with 3pl to reserve the necessary number of trucks .",
    "usually the agreement between the firm and 3pl is made _ under uncertainty _ without full information about the demand of goods .",
    "extra vehicles must be then purchased at a much higher cost than the initial one .",
    "we consider a supply planning problem to optimize vehicle - renting and transportation procurement activities to satisfy demand in several destinations out of several origins .",
    "uncertainty on the demands and on the costs of extra vehicles is considered .",
    "the logistic system is organized as follows : a set of suppliers , each of them composed by a set of plants ( origins ) has to satisfy the demand of a certain good from a set of factories ( destinations ) belonging to the same producer .",
    "the demand at the destination factory is considered stochastic .",
    "we assume a uniform fleet of vehicles with fixed capacity and we allow only full - load shipments .",
    "shipments are performed by booking a number of capacitated vehicles in advance , before the demand is revealed . when the demand becomes known , the number of used vehicles is determined and there is an option to discount vehicles booked but not actually used .",
    "the cancellation fee is given as a proportion of the transportation costs .",
    "if the quantity shipped from the suppliers using the booked vehicles is not enough to satisfy the demand at destination factory , residual product is purchased from an external company at a higher price , which is considered stochastic as well .",
    "the problem is to determine the number of vehicles to book from each plant of the set of suppliers to replenish the good at factory in order to minimize the total cost for the producer of good , given by the sum of the transportation costs from origins to destinations .",
    "we adopt the following notation .    [ not ]",

    "the objective function of our optimization problem is of the form @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes the booking costs of the vehicles , while @xmath126 represents the cost of recourse actions , consisting of buying good from external sources ( @xmath127 ) and canceling unwanted vehicles .",
    "we note that @xmath128 involves only deterministic parameters and nonadjustable , or first stage decision variables while , while @xmath129 also involves uncertain or stochastic parameters as well as adjustable or second stage decision variables .",

    "we will always impose nonnegativity constraints on the vectors @xmath141 , @xmath142 and sometimes integrality constraints on the vectors @xmath47 and @xmath143 , i.e. , @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the set of natural numbers .",
    "if the vectors @xmath146 and @xmath147 were known the optimization problem presented above would be a simple linear programming problem .",

    "we introduce several robust formulations ( ro ) for the problem described above .",
