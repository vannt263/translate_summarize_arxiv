    "quantum dots ( qds ) can be regarded as artificial atoms @xcite with an addition spectrum that depends on the single - particle state defined by the confinement @xcite as well as on the coulomb interaction and the exchange interaction between the electrons @xcite . a successive filling of a spin up and a spin down electron into the same orbital state",
    "is called a spin pair .",
    "the addition spectra of quantum dots have been investigated in various materials and for different geometries @xcite . while for qds formed in carbon nanotubes normally a successive filling with spin pairs is observed @xcite",
    ", this is usually not the case for qds in @xmath0 heterostructures @xcite .",
    "indeed , the exchange interaction in @xmath0 heterostructures is typically large enough to prevent a successive filling of spin up and spin down electrons into a qd by favoring parallel spins , and hence , spin pairs are observed only occasionally @xcite .",
    "signatures of spin - pairing @xcite were also observed in a statistical analysis @xcite of even and odd nearest neighbor peak spacings @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the measurement of many consecutive spin - pair candidates in a lateral @xmath0 quantum dot similar to the qds investigated in previous studies @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , pairwise parallel shifts in magnetic field of 20 and more consecutive coulomb peak pairs @xcite are observed .",
    "tunneling rates are recorded as a function of magnetic field and detuning of the chemical potential of the qd using time - resolved charge detection techniques .",
    "our device , shown in fig.[figure1](a ) , contains a quantum dot with a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) formed with metal electrodes .",
    "they are fabricated by electron beam lithography on a @xmath1heterostructure with a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) located 34@xmath2below the surface .",
    "the 2deg has a mobility of @xmath3 and an electron density of @xmath4 at a temperature of @xmath5 .",
    "the device is measured in a dilution refrigerator at an electron temperature of @xmath6 which corresponds to @xmath7 .",
    "the qd is investigated in a regime where it is populated by at least 160 - 200 electrons and where the current through the dot is equal to or less than @xmath8 .",
    "accurate measurements of such small currents are challenging .",
    "we therefore use a qpc charge detector capacitively coupled to the qd in order to detect the tunneling of single electrons in a time - resolved manner .",
    "a bias voltage of @xmath9 is applied to the qpc .",
    "the resulting time - resolved current is recorded with a sampling rate in the range of @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "the time - traces contain a random telegraph signal where the steps in the signal correspond to single electrons leaving or entering the qd .",
    "for the data evaluation it is crucial that the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is large enough to avoid false counts .",
    "therefore , after sampling , the data is digitally filtered ( @xmath12 or @xmath13 , 8th order bessel filter ) and resampled before extracting the number of electrons which entered and left the qd during a certain time . from the average times",
    "the qd is occupied ( unoccupied ) by an excess electron , the rate for tunneling out ( in ) can be determined accurately .",
    "a part of a time - trace is exemplarily shown in fig.[figure1](b ) .",
    "it corresponds to a point inside the white diamond in fig.[figure1](d ) .",
    "the evolution of the coulomb peaks in a magnetic field @xmath14 of up to @xmath15 is shown in fig.[figure1](c ) for @xmath16 .",
    "their positions fluctuate in magnetic fields up to @xmath15 by @xmath17 which is about 15 - 30% of their spacing @xcite .",
    "a pairwise correlation is clearly visible , suggesting the occurrence of spin pairs . in our sample",
    "the perpendicular magnetic field dependence is determined by the orbital wave functions rather than by the spin .",
    "therefore , two parallel shifting peaks indicate the same orbital wave function and therefore opposite spins due to the pauli principle@xcite .",
    "differences in the fluctuations between the first and the second peak of a spin pair@xcite are observed occasionally but are not in the focus of this paper .",
    "two examples of such deviations are visible for peak x and x at @xmath18 and at @xmath19 marked by blue arrows in fig.[figure1](c ) .    in total ,",
    "46 consecutive coulomb resonances are investigated and the pairwise correlation for all of them is as clear as for those shown in fig.[figure1](c ) . in five cases , however ,",
    "triples are observed instead of pairs .",
    "the triples are most likely pairs where one coulomb resonance is recorded twice due to corresponding charge rearrangements @xcite .",
    "these charge rearrangements can be clearly identified in coulomb - blockade diamond measurements .",
    "they are caused by single charge traps close to the quantum dot and occur at a certain plunger gate voltage .",
    "additionally , several times over the total measurement period of about 4 months , spontaneous small charge rearrangements happened .",
    "for example between the measurement in fig.[figure1](c ) and fig.[figure1](d ) , a shift of @xmath20 occurred .",
    "the fluctuations and the order of the peaks did not change due to the rearrangements . for small rearrangements",
    "no triples where observed and the positions of all peaks shifted only slightly .",
    "however , for large rearrangements , happening at a certain plunger gate voltage , triples were measured and all peaks occurring at larger plunger gate voltages are shifted with respect to the others .",
    "+      in fig.[figure1](d ) , the number of electrons entering and leaving the qd per second is plotted as a function of the bias voltage applied to the qd and the plunger gate voltage @xmath21 . in the black areas in the middle of the coulomb blockade",
    "diamonds the number of electrons in the dot is constant .",
    "the charging energy is about @xmath22 and the single - level spacing is estimated to be @xmath23 with @xmath24 , which is in agreement with the excited states observed in the measurement . according to ref .",
    ", the ratio of electron - electron interaction energy and fermi energy , characterized by the electron gas interaction parameter @xmath25 , is a measure for the probability to observe spin pairs . if @xmath26 , spin pairs are expected to be the norm .",
    "however , there is still a finite probability for s=1 states@xcite . for increasing values of @xmath25 , the probability for higher spin values increases and hereby the occurrence of spin pairs is less likely .",
    "it is expected that for typical values of @xmath27 spin pairs are still likely to appear @xcite . for our structure",
    "the electron gas interaction parameter can be estimated to be @xmath28 , with the effective bohr radius @xmath29 , the bohr radius @xmath30 , the relative dielectric constant @xmath31 , the electron mass @xmath32 and the effective electron mass @xmath33 . at low interaction strength",
    "the exchange energy can be calculated via the relation @xmath34 valid for @xmath35 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath36 , hence the obtained value @xmath37 might be a lower bound for @xmath38 as for stronger interactions @xmath39 the exchange energy is expected to become a significant fraction of the single - particle level spacing of @xmath40@xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , the exchange interaction seems negligible in the investigated regime of our device in contrast to previous results @xcite .",
    "one possible reason for this could be shielding due to the top gates located only @xmath41 above the 2deg in this heterostructure .",
    "however , it is unlikely that this effect plays a major role as the top gates are not located exactly above the qd and the screening length of the 2deg is estimated to be only around @xmath42 .",
    "+      in fig.[figure2](a ) two other spin pairs ( ii / ii and iii / iii ) are shown as a function of plunger gate voltage @xmath43 and perpendicular magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "the color code corresponds to the number of electrons entering and leaving the qd per second extracted from the qpc current measured as a function of time . from these time traces",
    "( see fig.[figure1](b ) ) , the tunneling rates @xmath44 , @xmath45 can be extracted assuming a single - level model . for the peaks",
    "ii / ii and iii / iii the tunneling rates are shown in fig.[figure2](b ) at zero magnetic field .",
    "they are fitted by the single - level expressions @xmath46 and @xmath47 using a maximum likelihood method , where the contribution of the individual data points is weighted by the inverse square of the statistical error . here",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 are constant fitting parameters and @xmath50 is the fermi function , where @xmath51 is the chemical potential . from the fits",
    "an upper limit for the electron temperature of @xmath52 is extracted .      for further investigation ,",
    "the tunneling rates are determined also as a function of perpendicular magnetic field @xmath14 .",
    "the results for pair iii/iii ( shown in fig.[figure3](f),(g ) ) are presented in fig.[figure3](a - e ) . in fig.[figure3](a )",
    "the tunneling - out rate @xmath53is plotted , where clear step - like transitions are visible ( marked by arrows ) .",
    "a cut of fig.[figure3](a ) and ( d ) is presented in fig.[figure3](c ) to emphasize these step - like transitions in the tunneling - out rate of peak iii. the data corresponding to peak iii are plotted in fig.[figure3](b),(e ) , ( g ) .",
    "the step - like features can be explained by a crossing of two energy levels@xcite .",
    "additionally , four cuts at various magnetic fields are plotted in fig.[figure3](h - k ) and discussed later on in the paper . in the following section we focus on the investigation of the individual tunneling rates of single levels .",
    "spin up and down electrons are filled alternately into a single spin - degenerate energy level of the qd in a model where the exchange interaction is neglected .",
    "the rates for tunneling into and out of the qd are expected to behave as depicted in fig.[figure4](a,@xmath54b ) assuming zero bias voltage , equal electrochemical potential for @xmath55 and @xmath56 electrons in the qd ( @xmath57 ) and equal tunnel coupling for both spin species . for these assumptions",
    "the spin relaxation time has no influence on the resulting tunneling - in and tunneling - out rates .",
    "the red arrows mark options for a tunneling - in or -out event and the gray ( white ) filled circles refer to occupied ( unoccupied ) states .",
    "the first electron of the spin pair can either be a spin up or a spin down electron ( see fig.[figure4](a ) ) .",
    "as soon as one electron tunneled into the qd , a second electron can only enter if the spin is opposite to the one of the first electron of the spin pair and if it has a larger energy due to the extra charging energy needed ( see fig.[figure4](b ) ) . if the qd is occupied with the first electron of the spin pair",
    ", this electron has the chance to tunnel out .",
    "if however both the spin - up and the spin - down electron are filled into the qd either of them can tunnel out .",
    "therefore the tunneling - in rate for the first electron of the spin pair is expected to be twice as large as the tunneling - out rate and vice versa for the second electron of the spin pair@xcite .",
    "here we used the additional assumption that the tunnel coupling is independent of any extrinsic parameter such as gate voltage and magnetic field .",
    "even though there is evidence that spin pairs are present in the investigated qd regime due to the parallel coulomb peak evolution at finite magnetic field , the simple model presented in fig.[figure4](a,@xmath54b ) only predicts the rates observed in the experiment approximately .    as an example we consider the peaks ii / ii and iii / iii in fig.[figure2](b )",
    "the first electron of the spin pair is marked with a prime symbol while the second electron has a label without prime symbol . for peak iii ( @xmath58,@xmath59 ) and iii ( @xmath60,@xmath61 )",
    "we find : ( @xmath62/@xmath63= @xmath64 , @xmath65/@xmath66=@xmath67 , @xmath62/@xmath66= @xmath68,@xmath65/@xmath63=@xmath69 ) .",
    "similarly for the other presented pair ( ii , ii ) we find ratios of @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "investigating the tunneling rates of 12 pairs / triples at zero magnetic field we find that most of them do not behave precisely as predicted by the model , meaning that the ratio @xmath74 of the tunneling rates is often neither exactly 2 nor 1/2 .",
    "+ possible reasons why the model does not hold at zero magnetic field are discussed in the following . the wave function overlap of an electron in the qd with the lead might depend on the spin with the consequence that @xmath75 is not necessarily true .",
    "however , the effect that electrons with a specific spin direction ( @xmath55 or @xmath56 ) prefer to tunnel would only bring the ratios of tunneling rates closer to one .",
    "hence , this argument does not qualify for explaining the measured tunneling rates .",
    "the capacitive cross - talk of the plunger gate to the source and drain barrier can have an influence on the tunneling rates as well .",
    "the barriers are expected to close slightly for more negative gate voltage values and hence we would expect @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this model does not fully explain the experimental observations either .",
    "as there are at least @xmath80 electrons in the qd , multi - level transport due to orbital degeneracies might be another reason for the measured tunneling rates at zero magnetic field partly shown in fig.[figure2 ] .",
    "+      the tunneling rates at small finite magnetic fields are analyzed using the data shown in fig.[figure3 ] .",
    "for the first electron of the spin pair the extracted ratios of the tunneling rates @xmath81 are @xmath82 ( fig.[figure3](i ) ) and @xmath83 ( fig.[figure3](j ) ) , also marked in fig.[figure3](a , d ) by dash - dotted white lines .",
    "for the second electron the ratios of the tunneling rates @xmath84 are @xmath85 ( fig.[figure3](h ) ) and @xmath86 ( fig.[figure3](k ) ) , also marked in fig.[figure3](b , e ) by dash - dotted white lines .",
    "even though the measured values are around the expected ratio of @xmath87 , significant deviations can be identified .",
    "we therefore conclude that the assumptions for the model described in sec.[subsecmodel ] and fig.[figure4 ] are not entirely valid for our measurements .",
    "specifically , the dependence of the tunneling rate on the magnetic field and on the energy is not included in the model . in addition we observe signs of resonances in the leads .",
    "a potential candidate for such a resonant state in the leads is marked by an orange arrow in fig.[figure3](b / h ) .",
    "the presented data reveals many consecutive spin pairs in a regime where at least 160 - 200 electrons populate the qd .",
    "surprisingly , all investigated coulomb peaks appear in pairs ( or in triples in the case where one of the peaks is measured twice due to a charge rearrangement ) .",
    "one possible reason why exchange interaction is negligible for these measurements might be the shielding by the top gates located only @xmath41 above the 2deg in this heterostructure .",
    "furthermore , the tunneling rates are investigated as a function of plunger gate voltage and magnetic field .",
    "a comparison of the data with a standard model reveals discrepancies between data and expectations .",
    "however , resonances in the leads and energy dependent tunnel barriers seem to be promising candidates to explain the deviation .",
