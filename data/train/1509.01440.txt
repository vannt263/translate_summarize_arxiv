    "this is typically the low energy limit of the theory , and in this limit , the d - brane theory becomes a supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory . since d - branes can carry mass and charge we can find supergravity solutions carrying the same mass and charge .",
    "supergravity solutions are valid as long as the curvatures are locally small compared to the string scale @xmath2 .",

    "such quantum corrections can be implemented into the supergravity action by adding quadratic terms of the riemann tensor at the leading order as shown by gross and witten@xcite . including such quantum corrections one obtains the metric near the horizon as [ eq : metric - near - horr ] ds^2 & = &  ( - dt^2 + du^2 + u^2 d_8 ^ 2 ) , where h_i(u ) & = & ( + h_i ( u ) ) , [ eq : f1u ] f_1(u ) & = & 1 - + f_1 ( u ) , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are functions of @xmath24 .",

    "we perform a simple dimensional reduction along two lattice directions using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the resultant lattice action corresponds in the naive continuum limit to the target sixteen supercharge yang - mills theory in two dimensions . in this limit",
    "its exact supersymmetry is enhanced to four supercharges corresponding to the four scalar fermions that now appear in the dimensionally reduced theory@xcite .",
    "we will be interested in this theory at the large @xmath1 limit with t hooft coupling @xmath10 .",
    "the lattice theory is then governed by the coupling = , where @xmath180 and @xmath81 denote the number of lattice sites in the spatial and temporal directions , respectively .",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions for the fields on the remaining spatial circle and anti - periodic boundary conditions for fermions in the temporal direction in order to access the theory at finite temperature .",
    "simulations can be carried out using rhmc algorithm .",
    "it has been shown that the existence of a non - compact moduli space in the theory may render the thermal partition function divergent@xcite . in order to regulate this divergence",
    "one introduces mass terms for the scalar fields appearing in the lattice action with a dimensionless mass parameter m = m_phys .",
    "the mass terms added to the action have the form s_m = _ * n*tr ( u_^u_+ ( u_^u_)^-1 - 2 ) .",
    "such mass terms are effective at suppressing arbitrarily large fluctuations of the exponentiated scalar fields and reduces to simple mass terms for small fluctuations characterizing the continuum limit .",
    "these infrared regulator terms break supersymmetry softly and lift the quantum moduli space of the theory . in ref .",
    "[ ] simulations were performed for a range of the mass parameter in order to allow for an extrapolation @xmath181 .      in this section",
    "we present the numerical results of the studies performed in refs . [ ] .",
    "the simulations are based on the polyakov lines for both the thermal and spatial circle .",
    "these are defined in the usual way p_x & = & | tr_a_x=0^l-1 u_a_x | , + p_&= & | tr_a_=0^t-1 u_a _ | , where the unitary piece of the complexified link @xmath182 has been extracted to compute these expressions .",
    "the spatial and temporal polyakov lines are evaluated as functions of @xmath183 for various lattice sizes and number of colors .",
    "the temporal polyakov line remained close to unity in the simulations over a wide range of @xmath183 , indicating that the theory is ( temporally ) deconfined .",
    "the spatial polyakov line has a different behavior , they take values close to unity for small @xmath183 and fall rapidly to plateau at much smaller values for large @xmath183 .",
    "it is tempting to see the rather rapid crossover around @xmath184 as a signal for a would be thermal phase transition as the number of colors is increased .",
    "this conjecture is seen to be consistent with the lattice data .",
    "the plateau evident at large @xmath183 falls with increasing @xmath1 and the crossover sharpens .",
    "this is consistent with the thermal system developing a sharp phase transition in the large @xmath1 limit .",
    "simulations show that the @xmath185 model does exhibit the same thermal instability observed in the case of sixteen supercharge quantum mechanics for sufficiently low temperature @xmath186 , in agreement with the general arguments given in ref .",
    "the gravity prediction for the parametric behavior @xmath187 is consistent with the lattice data , and @xmath162 was estimated to be@xcite c_crit 3.5 , which indeed obeys the gravity prediction that @xmath162 is order one and @xmath163 .",
    "the value of the ratio gives the ratio of the gl thermal phase transition temperature to the gl dynamical instability temperature ( the minimum temperature to which uniform strings can be supercooled ) , so = .",
    "the gl instability temperature is known@xcite ( corresponding to the behavior @xmath188 at strong coupling ) however , the gl phase transition temperature is not known in the gravity theory as the localized solutions have not been constructed yet .",
    "the lattice estimation@xcite 1.5 provides a prediction for the thermal behavior of the gravity solutions .",
    "this was the first time a prediction about the properties of non - trivial classical gravity solutions had been made from the yang - mills side of a gauge - gravity correspondence .",
    "since the dual localized black hole solutions have not been constructed , this constitutes a prediction for these non - trivial gravity solutions , which hopefully will be tested by their construction in the near future .",
    "in this review we have focused on maximally supersymmetric lattice yang - mills theories in one and two dimensions and showed how they can validate and provide insight into the gauge - gravity duality conjecture . for the case of one - dimensional theories we have detailed the duality conjecture connecting d0-branes and black hole geometries at finite temperature to maximally supersymmetric thermal gauge theories at the same temperature .",
    "the internal energy of a quantum black hole with its leading order quantum gravity and string theory corrections has been derived recently in the gravitational theory .",
    "the predictions from supergravity can be verified by simulating the dual strongly coupled thermal gauge theories on the lattice and calculating the internal energy of the thermal system for a given number of colors and t hooft coupling .",
    "recent simulations indicate that the gauge theory results give excellent agreement with the quantum gravity predictions , thus proving strong evidence for the validity of the duality conjecture .",
    "we detailed the naive and manifestly supersymmetric constructions of maximally supersymmetric lattice yang - mills theories and the simulation algorithms used to probe the strong coupling regimes of these gauge theories at finite temperature and number of colors .",
    "we have also briefly detailed the results on the duality in two - dimensional sixteen supercharge thermal gauge theories and corresponding supergravity solutions .",
    "we also note that the existing results for the two - dimensional system can be improved using improved lattice simulation methods recently proposed in refs .",
    "[ ] .    it would be interesting to extend the analysis of the gauge - gravity duality to three- and four - dimensional yang - mills systems , which are thought to be dual to d2- and d3-branes systems .",
    "such theories are easily accessible through the exact lattice supersymmetry formulation .",
    "another interesting matrix model to investigate in the context of gauge - gravity duality is the berkooz - douglas matrix model@xcite .",
    "this model is holographically dual to the back - reacted d0-d4 system .",
    "investigations on this model can give more extensive tests of the gauge - gravity duality .",
    "numerical simulations of the sixteen supercharge quantum mechanics model become increasingly difficult for smaller @xmath1 and lower temperatures .",
    "the simulations suffer from technical difficulties related to the divergence of the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices while sampling the important field configurations that contribute to the action",
    ". it would be remarkable if we could tackle this problem using new numerical or analytical methods to provide more insight into the gauge - gravity duality and the internal structure of quantum black holes .",
