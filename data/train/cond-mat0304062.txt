    "an efficient statistical description of complex fluids and biomolecular assemblies generally requires some degree of coarse - graining to be tractable .",
    "a good example is the `` implicit solvent '' description of colloids or biomolecules in aqueous solution where water is replaced by a polarizable continuum .",
    "an important , largely unsolved , question that arises is that of inhomogeneous screening of solute ions near interfaces .",

    ", an attempt was made to calculate the permittivity of a polar fluid near a planar interface by a generalization of onsager s cavity model  @xcite . in this letter , we reconsider the problem in a general statistical mechanics framework and a number of exact results are established to assess the validity of the concept of a local permittivity .",

    "the surrounding media that confine the fluid may be polarisable , and are treated using macroscopic electrostatics .",
    "the molecules carry a permanent dipole moment @xmath5 and are assumed to be non polarisable . the position and the dipole moment of the @xmath6th molecule",

    "the molecules interact via the pair potential @xmath8 where the first term is a short - range interaction must decay at least as @xmath9 at large relative distances .",
    "in addition to short - range repulsion , it may include the effects of higher multipole moments of the molecules . ] and the second term is the dipolar interaction with a cut - off for distances @xmath10 less than the molecular diameter  @xmath11 [ @xmath12  is the heaviside function ] .",
