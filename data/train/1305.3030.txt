    "<S> we examine the wavefunctions and their scalar products of a one - parameter family of integrable five vertex models . at a special point of the parameter </S>",
    "<S> , the model investigated is related to an irreversible interacting stochastic particle system the so - called totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) . by combining the quantum inverse scattering method with a matrix product representation of the wavefunctions , </S>",
    "<S> the on / off - shell wavefunctions of the five vertex models are represented as a certain determinant form . </S>",
    "<S> up to some normalization factors , we find the wavefunctions are given by grothendieck polynomials , which are a one - parameter deformation of schur polynomials . introducing a dual version of the grothendieck polynomials , and utilizing the determinant representation for the scalar products of the wavefunctions , we derive a generalized cauchy identity satisfied by the grothendieck polynomials and their duals . several representation theoretical formulae for grothendieck polynomials </S>",
    "<S> are also presented . as a byproduct , the relaxation dynamics such as green functions for the periodic tasep are found to be described in terms of grothendieck polynomials .    </S>",
