    "there has been much interest recently , both theoretically and experimentally , in the quantum phases of the two - dimensional electron system in higher landau levels ( lls ) .",
    "hartree - fock ( hf ) studies@xcite have shown that , for small partial filling factors @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 the total filling factor and @xmath6 the landau level index ) , the electrons form a triangular wigner crystal ( wc ) , while for @xmath1 close to @xmath7 the ground state of the system is a unidirectional charge density wave or `` stripe '' state.@xcite between these two regions , hf@xcite and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods,@xcite as well as exact diagonalization on small systems,@xcite have suggested the existence of a new kind of crystal structure , the `` bubble crystal '' ( bc ) , with more than one electron per lattice cell . while hf predicts transitions between bubble phases with increasing number @xmath8 of electrons per bubble , with @xmath8 going up to @xmath9 electrons in ll @xmath6 , in dmrg the last bubble phase is absent , and a transition takes place directly from the bc with @xmath10 electrons per bubble to the stripe state .",
    "it is noteworthy that the difference in cohesive energy between all these different phases remains very small , of order @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 the electronic charge , @xmath13 the dielectric constant of the host semiconductor and @xmath14 the magnetic length ) .    on the experimental side , evidence for the existence of these different phases",
    "is found mainly through transport experiments .",
    "early dc measurements@xcite have shown strongly anisotropic transport around half - filling , which was interpreted as evidence for a stripe state .",
    "crystal phases of electrons , which are pinned by quenched disorder , should all be insulating in the dc regime .",
    "one has therefore to resort to other experimental techniques to resolve the transitions between these different crystal phases ( e.g. wc to bc ) .",
    "one particular such technique consists in measuring the microwave response of the 2des , which would give different resonant behavior for different electronic crystalline phases .",
    "while early microwave conductivity experiments@xcite gave considerable support to the existence of a wc around integer filling @xmath15 and @xmath16 for @xmath17 , it was not until recently that coexistence between two phases with two distinct resonant peaks was observed by lewis _ et al._@xcite .",
    "it is our aim in this paper to discuss in some detail the experimental results of this last reference , in light of recent advances in resonance pinning theories of two - dimensional electronic solids.@xcite in order to do so , we will need to develop a microscopic picture of the 2des as a system of interacting _",
    "guiding centers_. indeed , after projection of the electronic density on the uppermost landau level the problem at hand reduces to one of interacting guiding centers ( of quenched kinetic energy ) with an appropriately defined effective interaction potential that includes quantum effects at the hartree - fock level .",
    "the knowledge of the effective interaction potential between guiding centers will allow us to find the elastic moduli and the normal eigenmodes of the wigner and bubble crystals .",
    "in agreement with the results of maki and zotos@xcite for the wc in the lowest ll , we find that the shear moduli ( @xmath0 s ) of the wigner and bubble crystals show a non - monotonic behavior as a function of the partial filling factor @xmath1 at any given landau level , with @xmath0 increasing for small values of @xmath1 , before reaching a maximum at some intermediate filling factor @xmath2 , and then monotonically decreasing for @xmath3",

    "we find that , while the @xmath1 behavior of the first resonance peak observed in this last reference is in good qualitative agreement with existing theoretical predictions for the pinned wigner crystal,@xcite the second resonance peak has a behavior as a function of @xmath1 which is quite different from what a linearized solution of self - consistent equations for the microwave response theories predict for the two - electron bubble state .",

    "the values of the cohesive energies shown , and of the partial filling factor @xmath1 , at which transitions between the different phases occur in both landau levels , are in excellent agreement with recent hartree - fock calculations by ct _",
