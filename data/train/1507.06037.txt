    "irc+10216 ( cw leo ) is the closest asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star to earth ( @xmath23  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "during the last decades this star was usually considered as an isolated star with an effective temperature of @xmath24  k @xcite and surrounded by an optically thick c - rich circumstellar envelope ( cse ) composed of molecular gas and dust , which results from the ejection of stellar material at a rate @xmath25 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although there were indirect evidences suggesting that it could be actually a binary system @xcite , @xcite recently reported the discovery of what could be a faint companion of the agb star responsible of the ejected matter .",
    "more than 80 molecular species have been detected in its cse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although most of them form in the outer envelope , the so - called parent molecules ( e.g. , co , c@xmath18h@xmath18 , hcn , sis , sio , cs , sic@xmath18 , si@xmath18c ) are formed in warm and dense shells near the stellar photosphere @xcite , where strong dynamical mechanisms probably exist @xcite and an active chemistry has been inferred @xcite . the dust formation and the subsequent gas acceleration involved in the development of the envelope ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are supposed to be intimately related to the refractory nature and abundance of the parent molecules , in particular to c- and si - bearing species such as sis , sic@xmath18 , and si@xmath18c @xcite .",
    "these molecules are believed to be highly depleted due to dust throughout the first @xmath26@xmath14 outwards from the stellar photosphere @xcite .",
    "the emission of sis has been analysed in the mid - infrared @xcite , the submillimetre @xcite , and the millimetre frequency ranges @xcite .",
    "its abundance throughout the middle and outer envelope is reasonably well estimated ( @xmath27 outwards from @xmath28  arcsec ) but its value in the innermost envelope is still controversial due to discrepancies of up to one order of magnitude between the results of several works .",
    "the main goal of the current work is to derive a reliable sis abundance profile for the innermost envelope of irc+10216 in order to settle the controversy through the analysis of high spectral resolution molecular observations in the mid - ir , which has been proven as a powerful method to probe the region close to the central star @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the identification of 265 lines of the vibrational bands @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 of the silicon sulphide isotopologues @xmath0si@xmath1s , @xmath2si@xmath1s , @xmath0si@xmath3s , and @xmath4si@xmath1s observed with high - spectral resolution ( @xmath29  km  s@xmath17 ) towards irc+10216 .",
    "about 30  per  cent of them have enough quality to be properly fitted and analysed . the observing procedure is included in section  [ sec : observations ] .",
    "comments on the fitting process of the molecular lines can be found in section  [ sec : modelling ] .",
    "the description of the observed sis lines , the results of the fitting procedure , and their analysis are addressed in section  [ sec : results ] . finally , a brief summary of the current work and our conclusions can be found in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we observed irc+10216 with the texas echelon - cross - echelle spectrograph ( texes ; * ? ? ? * ) at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on 2002 dec 12 .",
    "we used the texes high resolution echelon grating with a first order grating as the cross - disperser . in this mode , a single setting covered a spectral range of @xmath30 m . the entire range ( @xmath31 m )",
    "was covered with 10 separate settings .",
    "we nodded irc+10216 off the slit for sky subtraction .",
    "the weather was good enough during the observations that the median background level measured in the _ off _ positions showed no significant variations .",
    "we used a black body - sky difference spectrum to correct for the atmosphere .",
    "the data were reduced with the standard texes pipeline @xcite .",
    "we normalised each spectrum by removing the baseline with a polynomial fit .",
    "the rms of the random noise is @xmath32  per  cent of the continuum emission .",
    "although most of the lines in the spectrum are produced by c@xmath18h@xmath18 , hcn , and their main isotopologues @xcite , we have identified 204 lines of @xmath0si@xmath1s , 26 of @xmath2si@xmath1s , 20 of @xmath0si@xmath3s , and 15 of @xmath4si@xmath1s in the frequency range between 720 to 790  @xmath6 .",
    "a hundred and fifteen of the @xmath0si@xmath1s lines belong to band @xmath7 , 54 to band @xmath22 , 13 to band @xmath33 , 16 of band @xmath34 , and 6 of band @xmath35 .",
    "seventy three of them are unblended or partially blended and can be fitted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "the identified lines of @xmath2si@xmath1s , @xmath0si@xmath3s , and @xmath4si@xmath1s pertain to band @xmath7 .",
    "three , two , and one of them , respectively , are unblended or partially blended and can be reasonably fitted .",
    "the lines of bands involving vibrational states with higher energy are below the detection limit .",
    "no lines of the other sis isotopologues , which are at least 100 times less abundant than @xmath0si@xmath1s ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been detected in our spectrum .",
    "we have used the low spectral resolution _",
    "iso_/sws observations carried out on 1996 may 31 @xcite to determine the properties of the dusty envelope .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty of these observations due to noise and the calibration process in @xmath36  per  cent .",
    "the observed sis lines were fitted and analysed with the aid of the code developed by @xcite , which solves numerically the radiation transfer equation of a spherically symmetric envelope composed of gas and dust in radial expansion .",
    "it was successfully used to analyse the mid - ir spectra of c@xmath18h@xmath18 , hcn , c@xmath37h@xmath18 , and c@xmath38h@xmath18 at 8 and @xmath39 m towards irc+10216 and the protoplanetary nebula crl618 @xcite .",
    "the code _ does not _ solve the statistical equilibrium equations , which would require a very large amount of cpu time to determine the population of all the ro - vibrational levels involved in the calculations .",
    "instead , it makes use of rotational and vibrational temperature profiles provided by the user .",
    "the code solves the radiation transfer equation and produces the spectrum of the envelope convolved with a given gaussian beam .",
    "the new 3d version of this code , presented in @xcite , allowed us to calculate as well the emission of a simple asymmetrical envelope . a deeper insight on how this code works in its 1d and 3d versions and its benchmarking",
    "can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    ".stellar and envelope parameters involved in the fits [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     \\(1 ) this work ( 2 ) @xcite ( 3 ) @xcite ( 4 ) @xcite ( 5 ) @xcite ( 6 ) @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the isotopic ratios by @xcite presented here were calculated by assuming as reliable the isotopic ratios derived from optically thin lines that do not show extended emission when possible ( see table  6 of this reference ) .",
    "the observed lines of @xmath2si@xmath1s , @xmath0si@xmath3s , and @xmath4si@xmath1s belong to band @xmath7 and show shapes compatible with p - cygni profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "these lines are weak , with differences between the maximum emission and absorption of about three to four times @xmath40 for lines with @xmath41 .",
    "most of the lines in the observed frequency range are blended with c@xmath18h@xmath18 , hcn , and @xmath0si@xmath1s lines .",
    "only a handful of lines over the detection limit are sufficiently isolated and can be conveniently fitted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) .",
    "the lines of @xmath2si@xmath1s and @xmath0si@xmath3s were strong enough to derive the isotopic ratios @xmath0si/@xmath2si and @xmath1s/@xmath3s with a relatively good accuracy of @xmath42 and 40  per  cent , respectively ( table  [ tab : table4 ] ) .",
    "the fit to the only @xmath4si@xmath1s line suitable to be analysed gave an isotopic ratio @xmath0si/@xmath4si of 39 with an error of 60  per  cent .",
    "the lack of available lines and the large uncertainty prevent us to derive reliable conclusions about this isotopic ratio .",
    "the ratios @xmath0si/@xmath2si and @xmath1s/@xmath3s are compatible with previous estimates derived from observations carried out in the mm wavelength range ( table  [ tab : table4 ] ) .",
    "these observations mostly recovered the long scale emission of the envelope that comes from layers composed of matter expelled more than @xmath43  yr ago @xcite , while our observations traced gas recently ejected .",
    "hence , no significant changes in the nucleosynthesis of the most abundant si and s isotopes are expected to have happened during the last 1000  yr .",
    "in this paper , we have presented high spectral resolution observations in the mid - ir range ( @xmath44 m ) towards the agb star irc+10216 .",
    "two hundred and four lines coming from band @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 of @xmath0si@xmath1s , 26 from @xmath7 of @xmath2si@xmath1s , 20 from @xmath7 of @xmath0si@xmath3s , and 15 from @xmath7 of @xmath4si@xmath1s have been identified in the observed spectrum .",
    "about 30  per  cent of the total set of detected lines are unblended or partially blended and could be fitted and analysed .",
    "we have found that :    * the quality of the fits is higher by assuming that the gas expansion velocity profile grows linearly from the photosphere up to 5@xmath14 following the dependence @xmath45  km  s@xmath17 compared to the fits based on a constant velocity of 5  km  s@xmath17 .",
    "our fits support the expansion velocity profile proposed by @xcite outwards from 5@xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath46  km  s@xmath17 and @xmath47  km  s@xmath17 . *",
    "the abundance of @xmath0si@xmath1s is @xmath19 between the stellar photosphere and the inner acceleration shell ( located at 5@xmath14 ) and decreases linearly down to @xmath20 at the outer acceleration shell ( at 20@xmath14 ) .",
    "the observed lines are compatible with an abundance of @xmath21 at 50@xmath14 .",
    "the decrease in the abundance beyond the inner acceleration shell is probably explained by the depletion of sis on to the dust grains due to its refractory nature and the lack of gas - phase chemical reactions expected to be enabled in this region of the cse .",
    "* @xmath0si@xmath1s is vibrationally out of lte in most of the envelope .",
    "the vibrational temperature for the vibrational ground state is @xmath48  k between the stellar surface and the inner acceleration shell ( region i ) and @xmath49  k up to the outer acceleration shell ( region ii ) . for the @xmath50 vibrational state ,",
    "the relation is @xmath51  k in region i and @xmath52  k in region ii . beyond the outer acceleration shell ,",
    "the vibrational temperature for these states is compatible with an exponent of @xmath53 . for @xmath54 , 3 , and 4 ,",
    "the vibrational temperature is compatible with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57  k in region i , respectively .",
    "* @xmath0si@xmath1s can be assumed to be rotationally under lte with a rotational temperature of @xmath58  k between the stellar photosphere and the inner acceleration shell and @xmath59  k outwards .",
    "* there is a red - shifted emission excess at large velocities in the @xmath0si@xmath1s lines of bands @xmath7 and @xmath8 not noticed in the lines of bands @xmath33 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "this excess can be explained by an asymmetry of the vibrational temperature distribution for what the gas behind the star shows a higher excitation around @xmath60 that mostly affects the lines of band @xmath7 . * the isotopic ratios @xmath0si/@xmath2si and @xmath1s/@xmath3s derived from our observations are 17 and 14 , respectively .",
    "these ratios , referred to matter in the vicinity of the star , are compatible with the previously proposed values for outer shells of the envelope .",

    "in order to fit the observed lines , we initially chose the expansion velocity profile derived by @xcite from the analysis of several hundreds of c@xmath18h@xmath18 and hcn lines in the mid - ir . during the current work we slightly modified this velocity profile to improve the quality of the fits to the sis lines proving that the velocity profile derived by @xcite is essentially compatible with the actual profile .",
