    "after the astonishing numerical solution of bartnik and mckinnon  @xcite of the static spherically symmetric einstein - yang - mills equations with a su(2 ) gauge group , a fundamental question arose : do there exist essentially non - abelian static globally regular solutions or blackholes , which carry non - zero electric and/or magnetic charges  @xcite ?",
    "in first instance , one could prove in the spherically symmetric case  @xcite the existence of static solutions which are asymptotically flat and with finite mass .",
    "the members of this family of solutions could be characterized by the number of zeros of one of the gauge potentials .",
    "in fact the repulsive yang - mills force can balance the gravitational attractive force and prevent the formation of singularities in spacetime .",
    "later  @xcite the class of solutions were extended to blackhole solutions with a horizon at some @xmath0 and oscillating solutions which are not asymptotically flat .",
    "these non - abelian blackholes could represent counter examples to the no - hair conjecture .",
    "further , it was claimed  @xcite that both regular and blackhole solution in the spherically symmetric case will have gravitational - like and sphaleron - like instabilities . when it was found that the bm solution is unstable , a lot of researchers ( see for example  @xcite ) tackled the general stability problem of the coupled eym system and investigated the possible critical behavior of the solutions .",
    "it was realized that they had much in common with the electroweak sphalerons . in the spherical symmetric case",
    "the critical behavior was formulated by choptuik  @xcite .",
    "it occurred at the boundary in phase space between initial data which eventually form a blackhole and data which do not .",
    "recently it was found , in a two dimensional weinberg - salam model with an axially symmetric ansatz , that there is evidence for the existence of an electrically charged sphaleron state  @xcite .",
    "here we consider the eym system on an axially symmetric time dependent spacetime and will compare our investigations with the spherical symmetric case and the well known abelian cosmic string solution  @xcite , particularly the supermassive case . in these u(1)-gauge cosmic string models",
    "it was found that as the energy scale of symmetry breaking increases , the geometry around the string changes from conical to an analog of a kasner spacetime .",
    "but supermassive cosmic strings may also arise at gut scales if the coupling between scalar and gauge fields is weak .",
    "further , these low - energy supermassive strings are closely related to global strings : they both show singular behavior at finite distance from the core of the string .",
    "we conjecture that the string - like solution in the eintein - yang - mills model shows some similar behavior .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive the time dependent equations for the einstein - yang - mills system on an axially symmetric spacetime using the algebraic manipulation program maple . in section iii",
    "we consider the static situation in order to gain insight into the asymptotic and singular behavior . in section",
    "iv we solve the equations numerically and in section v we present a conclusion and prospect concerning the stability .",
    "we conjecture that conventional ( linear ) stability analysis is inadequate to be applied to the situation where a singularity is formed .",
    "the reason is that the oscillatory behavior of some of the gauge field components are of high - frequency .",
    "we suggest to apply the multiple - scale method  @xcite , a method suitable for handling high - frequency perturbations . in a future work",
    ", we will extend the investigation to the spinning case , as initiated before  @xcite .",
    "consider the lagrangian of the su(2 ) eym system @xmath1,\\ ] ] with the ym field strength @xmath2 @xmath3 the gauge coupling constant , @xmath4 newton s constant , @xmath5 the gauge potential and @xmath6 the curvature scalar .",
    "the field equations then become @xmath7 @xmath8    with @xmath9 the energy momentum tensor @xmath10 we are interested in solutions on the cylindrical symmetric spacetime @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "this cylindrical symmetric line element can formally be obtained from the stationary axisymmetric line element used by kleihaus and kunz  @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 functions of @xmath15 and @xmath19 , by the complex substitution @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "following bais and sasaki  @xcite we then can specify the gauge field potentials @xmath22 , where the @xmath23 are the anti - hermitian generators of the gauge group , by @xmath24dz+[\\chi_2\\hat\\tau_r + \\chi_1\\hat\\tau_z]d\\varphi,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 and @xmath26 functions of @xmath14 and @xmath15 and where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the axial generators of the su(2 ) normalized such that @xmath29=\\epsilon_{ijk}\\hat\\tau_k$ ] .",
    "one can reduce the number of gauge field potentials . on the euclidean spacetime ,",
    "the self - duality condition eliminates two of the six functions  @xcite .",
    "one also can use the additional u(1 ) gauge freedom on the @xmath5 , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "here we use the condition that on the spacetime ( 2.6 ) , the energy - momentum component @xmath32 must vanish .",
    "the most simple way to fulfil this condition is @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "there are some other possibilities , comparable with those found by manton  @xcite",
    ". however , these are quite complicated as already noticed by manton .",
    "so in our case , @xmath35 becomes @xmath36 we then have two possibilities : i. @xmath37constant@xmath38 and @xmath39 , or , ii .",
    "we consider here case i. the condition of case ii means that the ym mass scale @xmath41 . in section 3",
    "we shall see that it corresponds in the static case with a singular solution .",

    "now we can investigate the asymptotic behavior of @xmath87 and @xmath49 on the conical spacetime ( 3.17 ) and compare the asymptotic features with the abelian counterpart model . substituting the conical spacetime ( 3.17 ) into ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.7 )",
    "one obtains solutions for @xmath87 and @xmath49 .",
    "the solution is not sensitive for @xmath88 and @xmath89 . for positive @xmath90",
    "the solution will possess singular behavior at finite distance of the core , as expected from the abelian investigations of laguna and garfinkle  @xcite . in figure 1 - 3",
    "we plotted @xmath87 and @xmath49 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 and for different values of @xmath93 .",
    "it is observed that the singularity is pushed to infinity for smaller values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "this kind of singular behavior is also encountered in the abelian higgs model  @xcite when the scale of the symmetry breaking is far beyond the gut scale , i.e. , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "in fact , the conical picture of the string then fades away .",
    "it was found that the metric of the transition between conical and kasner - like is cylindrical , i.e. , @xmath97 .",
    "further it was found that supermassive strings can be formed at gut scales if @xmath98 , where e is the gauge coupling constant in the abelian model and @xmath99 the higgs self coupling constant , is very small .",
    "the singularity must then occur at a distance from the core of the string which is many orders of magnitude greater than the present hubble scale . in our model",
    "we find a comparable dependency on @xmath93 of the behavior of the singularity .",
    "in general , however , one has to solve simultaneously the coupled system .",
    "moreover , one should make a distinction between the interior and exterior field equations with proper matching conditions , in order to get insight in the behavior close to the z - axis  @xcite .",
    "the set of equation ( 2.10)-(2.14 ) can be solved numerically .",
    "we used the isml software package for numerically solving coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "the package implements finite element collocation methods based on piecewise polynomials for the spatial discretization techniques .",
    "the time integration process is then accomplished for a set of ordinary differential equations using banded jacobians . for the order of the piecewise polynomial space we took 5 and for the number of subintervals into which the spatial domain is to be divided we took 11 .",
    "the relative error bound was @xmath100 . in order to obtain from ( 2.15 ) a regular and asymptotically correct initial value for @xmath49",
    ", we choose as initial values @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "figures 4 , 5 and 6 show a typical regular solution of @xmath104 and the metric component @xmath105 for some values of @xmath93 and @xmath106 and suitable boundary conditions .",
    "the behavior of @xmath87 remains regular everywhere . in figure 7",
    "we plotted @xmath49 for a smaller value of @xmath93 .",
    "we observe that @xmath49 approaches asymptotically a constant value .",
    "for runs where @xmath49 starts to oscillate , @xmath105 decreases strongly , signalling the formation of a singularity .",
    "however , a thoroughly investigation of the dependency on @xmath107 and @xmath4 will be necessary .",
    "this is currently under study .",
    "we investigated the existence of a possible solution of the coupled eym system on a time - dependent axially symmetric spacetime .",
    "at least on the conical spacetime we find evidence for regular behavior of the electric and magnetic components of the ym field for suitable values of the parameters @xmath93 , g and @xmath106 .",
    "the formation of a singularity at finite distance of the core of the string depends critically on @xmath93 , the constant value of one of the gauge field potentials , and @xmath106 . just as in the static spherically symmetric eymh case ,",
    "where the ratio @xmath108(@xmath96 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field ) plays a crucial role in the behavior of the solution , we find a crucial dependency on the ratio @xmath109 . in the abelian supermassive model  @xcite a similar behavior",
    "is encountered where the singularity arises at finite distance from the core of the string not only for large symmetry breaking scales as found by  @xcite , but also for gut scale .",
    "there is for fixed symmetry breaking scale of order of the gut scale a critical value for the coupling of the scalar to the gauge field ( i.e. , @xmath110 with e the coupling constant and @xmath99 the higgs self coupling ) for which the singularity occurs at finite distance of the core .",
    "these low energy solutions are more realistic because the larger the energy scale the larger the angle deficit and it no longer makes sense to talk about string type solutions . in our model , there will be a critical value @xmath111 for which the singularity is pushed to infinity .    in order to analyze the stability of the solutions ,",
    "one usually linearizes the field equations  @xcite , or one expands the field variables in a physically unclear small parameter  @xcite .",
    "one better can apply the so called multiple - scale ( or two - timing ) method , developed decades ago by taub  @xcite and choquet - bruhat  @xcite .",
    "this method is is particularly useful for constructing uniformly valid approximations to solutions of perturbation problems .",
    "the idea is to expand the several field variables in power series of the ratio of the characteristic wavelength of the perturbations and the characteristic dimension of the background .",
    "one writes  @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 a phase function .",
    "the parameter @xmath115 measures the ratio of the fast scale to the slow one .",
    "the rapid variation only occur in the direction of the vector @xmath116 . for a function @xmath117 one",
    "has @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 . substituting the expansions of the field variables into the equations and collecting terms of equal orders of @xmath115 , one obtains propagation equations for @xmath121 and @xmath122 and back - reaction equations for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "it is clear from the propagation equation that there will be a coupling between the high - frequency gravitational field and the high - frequency behavior of @xmath49 when the singularity will be approached . on his turn",
    ", @xmath49 will create a high - frequency perturbation in @xmath87 .",
