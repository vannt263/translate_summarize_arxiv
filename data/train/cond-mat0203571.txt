    "<S> matter * 14 * , l591 ( 2002 )    understanding the nature of strong many - body correlations in condensed - matter finite systems is a fundamental task , which can be facilitated by devising analytical or semi - analytical many - body wave functions that approximate well the exact solutions and capture the essential physical properties of such systems . </S>",
    "<S> the description of strong correlations in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron gas in a high magnetic field by the laughlin wave function @xcite represents a celebrated example of such a methodology .    </S>",
    "<S> here we construct semianalytical correlated wave functions for electrons in 2d single and molecular quantum dots ( qd s ) , which are manmade devices created at semiconductor interfaces and are most often referred to as artificial atoms and molecules ( since they contain a finite number of electrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> to this end , we employ a two - step approach consisting of symmetry breaking at the hartree - fock single - determinantal level and subsequent symmetry restoration via projection techniques ( pt s ) resulting in multi - determinantal wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> pt s have been introduced earlier in quantum chemistry @xcite for the restoration of the total spin of a molecule and in nuclear physics @xcite for the restoration of the total 3d angular momentum ( space rotational symmetry ) of deformed open - shell nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> our application of these methods to circular single quantum dots ( sqd s ) requires the simultaneous restoration of both the spin and the angular - momentum symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement poses a more demanding challenge compared to the task of restoring a single broken symmetry , as is the case with the quantum - chemistry and nuclear - physics many - body problems .    </S>",
    "<S> since the approach of restoration of broken symmetries is largely untested and unknown in the framework of 2d qd s , we aim in this paper at focusing on methodological aspects . for simplicity and conceptual clarity </S>",
    "<S> , we construct below strongly correlated wave functions for the case of two interacting electrons in a sqd ( artificial helium , he - qd ) and in a lateral double quantum dot ( artificial hydrogen quantum dot molecule , h@xmath0-qdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> two strongly - correlated electrons ( with or without an external magnetic field ) may exhibit a complex behavior @xcite and can provide the foundation for understanding the properties of a larger number of interacting electrons . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the recent growth of interest in quantum computing focussed attention on the potential ability to manipulate the ground - state entanglement of two - electron quantum - dot systems @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the two - body hamiltonian for two interacting electrons constrained to move on a plane is given by , @xmath1 where the last term is the coulomb repulsion with @xmath2 being the dielectric constant of the semiconductor material . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 is the single - particle hamiltonian for an electron in an external perpendicular magnetic field @xmath4 and an appropriate potential confinement . for a qdm </S>",
    "<S> , the external confinement is given by a two - center - oscillator potential , and the single - particle hamiltonian is written as , @xmath5 where @xmath6 with @xmath7 for @xmath8 ( left ) and @xmath9 for @xmath10 ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 denotes the coordinate perpendicular to the interdot axis ( @xmath12 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , and the last term in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hsp ] ) is the zeeman interaction with @xmath15 being the effective @xmath16 factor , @xmath17 the bohr magneton , and @xmath18 the spin of an individual electron . </S>",
    "<S> the shapes described by @xmath19 are two equal semi - circles connected by a smooth neck [ @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 are the centers of these semi - circles , @xmath22 is the interdot distance , and @xmath23 is the effective electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> the case of a sqd is obtained for @xmath24 , and in this case the confining potential is purely parabolic . for the smooth neck , we use @xmath25 \\theta(|y|-|y_k|)$ ] , where @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be expressed via one parameter , as follows : @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where the barrier - control parameter @xmath34 is related to the actual ( controlable ) height of the bare barrier ( @xmath35 ) between the two qd s , and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle levels of @xmath19 are obtained by numerical diagonalization ( for details see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    in each case , in the first step of our procedure , the two - electron hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ ham ] ) ] </S>",
    "<S> is solved @xcite in the ( symmetry - breaking ) spin - and - space unrestricted hartree - fock ( ss - uhf ) approximation ; for comparison , the symmetry - adapted restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) will also be considered . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> , we will use @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 ( this effective - mass value corresponds to gaas ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will vary the dielectric constant @xmath2 , however , in order to control the ratio of the strength of the coulomb repulsion relative to the zero - point kinetic energy ( see in particular the case of the sqd and figure 3 below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of this ratio provides us with the ability to study the whole range of electron correlations , from the regime of weak correlations to that of strong correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> we start with the case of a lateral h@xmath0-qdm in a magnetic field , where only the spin projection needs to be considered , since the confining potential lacks circular symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the example we discuss here - qdm at different values of @xmath2 [ including @xmath39 ( gaas ) ] and interdot barrier heights , demonstrating gate control of the entanglement of a pair of electrons , see ref .  @xcite . ]  corresponds to the case of weak interelectron repulsion ( the full choice of parameters is given in the caption of fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ss - uhf determinant ( henceforth we drop the prefix ss in subscripts ) which describes the `` singlet '' ( see below ) ground state of the h@xmath0-qdm is given by the expression , @xmath40 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ det ] ) , we have used a compact notation for the slater determinant with @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the @xmath45-like ( left ) and @xmath46-like ( right ) localized orbitals of the ss - uhf solution , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote the up and down spin functions , respectively . such orbitals for the field - free case </S>",
    "<S> are displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ( left column ) . similar localized orbitals ( which are complex functions ) can appear also in the @xmath49 case [ see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , right column ] .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath50 is an eigenstate of the @xmath51-projection of the total spin , @xmath52 , with eigenvalue @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not an eigenstate of the square , @xmath54 , of the total spin ( thus the quotation marks in `` singlet '' above ) . from the determinant @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> , one can generate a singlet eigenstate of @xmath54 ( with zero eigenvalue ) by applying the projection operator @xmath55 , where the operator @xmath56 interchanges the spins of the two electrons .    </S>",
    "<S> thus the singlet state of the two localized electrons is given by the projected wave function , @xmath57 in contrast to the single - determinantal wave functions of the rhf and ss - uhf methods , the projected many - body wave function ( [ prj0 ] ) is a linear superposition of two slater determinants , and thus it is an entangled state representing a corrective ( post - hartree - fock ) step beyond the mean - field approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the spatial reflection symmetry is automatically restored along with the spin symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ prj0 ] ) has the form of a heitler - london ( hl ) or valence bond @xcite wave function . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike the original hl scheme which uses the orbitals @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the separated ( left and right ) qd s , expression ( [ prj0 ] ) employs the ss - uhf orbitals which are self - consistently optimized for any separation @xmath60 , ineterdot barrier height @xmath35 , and magnetic field @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> . consequently , expression ( [ prj0 ] ) can be characterized as a generalized heitler - london ( ghl ) wave function . in the context of qd s </S>",
    "<S> , the simple hl approach has been proven very useful in demonstrating @xcite that the h@xmath0-qdm under an external magnetic field can function as an elemental two - qubit logic gate . </S>",
    "<S> our more accurate ghl approach has the potential of greatly improving the quality of similar investigations regarding the implementation of quantum computing using solid - state nanodevices .    </S>",
    "<S> we further notice that our ghl method belongs to a class of projection techniques known as variation before projection ( vbp ) , unlike the familiar in quantum chemistry generalized valence bond method @xcite , or the spin - coupled valence bond method @xcite , which employ a variation after projection ( vap ) ( see e.g. ch . </S>",
    "<S> 11.4.2 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in the context of qd s </S>",
    "<S> , a generalization of our ghl approach along the vap technique may provide even more accurate results . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is left for future work , including the development of the pertinent computer codes .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy of a projected state is given @xcite in general by the formula , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the many - body hamiltonian and @xmath64 is a general projection operator with the property @xmath65 .    </S>",
    "<S> using the spin - projection operator @xmath66 in place of @xmath64 , we find for the total energy , @xmath67 , of the singlet ghl state , @xmath68~ , \\label{engvb}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , are the matrix elements of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath19 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham ] ) , and @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the direct and exchange matrix elements of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath73 is the overlap integral of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 orbitals , @xmath74 and the normalization parameter is given by @xmath75    at zero magnetic field , the electron orbitals are real functions and eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ engvb ] ) @xmath76 ( [ nuv ] ) reduce to a form familiar from the generalized valence bond theory of quantum chemistry @xcite .    for the triplet state with @xmath77 , </S>",
    "<S> the projected wave function coincides with the original hf determinant , so that the corresponding energies in all three approximation levels are equal , i.e. , @xmath78 .    * figure 1 * + * separate gif *     +    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) , we display the singlet - triplet energy gap , @xmath79 , of the h@xmath0-qdm as a function of the magnetic field @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> for all three levels of approximation , @xmath80 starts from a negative minimum ( singlet ground state ) and after crossing the zero value it remains positive ( triplet ground state ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , after crossing the zero line , the rhf curve incorrectly continues to rise sharply and moves outside of the plotted range . after reaching a broad maximum , the positive @xmath80 branches of both the ss - uhf and ghl curves approach zero for sufficiently large @xmath61 , a behavior which indicates that the h@xmath0-qdm dissociates with @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this molecular dissociation can be further seen in the orbitals themselves : at @xmath81 t [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) ] the orbitals are well localized on the individual dots , while at @xmath82 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) ] they extend over the entire qdm . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in addition to having the proper symmetry , ghl is energetically the best approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> we further note that systematic explorations for determining the border of hf instability ( i.e. , the appearance of broken symmetry solutions with lower energy ) in the case of the h@xmath0-qdm are not available . at @xmath82 , </S>",
    "<S> this border depends on all four parameters @xmath83 , @xmath2 , @xmath60 , and @xmath35 . for @xmath84 mev , @xmath85 </S>",
    "<S> nm , and @xmath86 , it was found @xcite that this border can be crossed by reducing the interdot barrier @xmath35 to zero . </S>",
    "<S> for the same values of @xmath61 , @xmath83 and @xmath60 , but for a different @xmath87 ( stronger interelectron repulsion , as is the case for gaas ) , however , all values of the interdot barrier ( @xmath88 ) represent cases that lie well within the region of instability .    </S>",
    "<S> next we address the case of two electrons at b=0 in a single qd with a parabolic confinement . as we have shown in earlier publications @xcite , the ss - uhf solution does not preserve the rotational symmetry for @xmath89 ( for @xmath90 , the ss - uhf solution collapses onto the rhf one ) . </S>",
    "<S> the wigner parameter @xmath91 expresses the ratio between the interelectron repulsion @xmath92 and the zero - point kinetic energy @xmath71 ; it is customary to take @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the spatial extent of an electron in the lowest state of the parabolic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath96 , showing that it can be varied through the choice of materials ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) and/or the strength of the confinement ( @xmath97 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath89 and for @xmath53 , the ss - uhf yields @xcite an infinite manifold of azimuthally degenerate ground - state configurations consisting of two localized antipodal orbitals , suggesting formation of an electron molecule @xcite ( also referred to as wigner molecule ) . for @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and for a specific azimuthal direction ( i.e. , @xmath100 ) , the two localized orbitals , @xmath101 and @xmath102 with up and down spin , respectively , are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) . as was the case with the double - dot example studied above , the @xmath53 ss - uhf determinant @xmath103 for @xmath100 is given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ det ] ) and thus , in addition to the rotational symmetry , it does not preserve the total - spin symmetry . for the singlet state , one can restore both symmetries successively , namely , one can generate appropriate projected wave functions , @xmath104 by applying the product operator , preserves the total spin , and thus the application of @xmath105 alone is sufficient.]@xmath106 [ both ] where the spin - projection operator @xmath66 produces a two - determinant singlet ghl wave function as previously explained . the angular - momentum projection operator @xmath105 yields multideterminantal wave functions having good total angular momentum @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter operator produces a linear superposition of an infinite number of azimuthal ghl wave functions and it is given ( see also ch . </S>",
    "<S> 11.4.6 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . ]  by @xcite , @xmath108~ , \\label{amp}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 is the operator for the total angular momentum . in the following we focus on the ground state , in addition to the ground state ( @xmath110 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the yrast - band states with odd values , @xmath111 1 , 3 , 5 , ... , are generated via a projection of the triplet state . ]  of the system with @xmath110 .     </S>",
    "<S> +    * figure 2 * + * separate gif *     +    it is instructive to examine the transformations of the ground - state electron densities ( ed s ) resulting from the successive approximations , rhf , ss - uhf , spin projection ( sp ) , and combined spin and angular momentum projection ( s&amp ) . for @xmath98 , such ed s </S>",
    "<S> are shown in fig .  2 . since the exact solution for two electrons in a parabolic confinement is available @xcite , we also plot the corresponding ed for the exact ground state in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ed s of the initial rhf [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ] and the final s&amp [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(e ) ] approximations are circularly symmetric , while those of the two intermediate approximations , i.e. , the ss - uhf and sp , do break the circular symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior graphically illustrates the meaning of the term restoration of symmetry and the interpretation that the ss - uhf broken - symmetry solution refers to the _ intrinsic _ ( rotating ) frame of reference of the electron molecule . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the s&amp electron density exhibits a characteristic flattening at the top in contrast to the more gaussian - type rhf one . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although not identical ( the exact ed is slightly flatter at the top ) , the s&amp ed closely resembles the exact one displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , we remark that the sp electron density exhibits in the middle a shallower depression than the corresponding ss - uhf one , in keeping with the fact that the covalent bonding increases the probability of finding the electrons between the individual dots .    using the projection operator ( [ cpr ] ) in the general eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ epr ] ) , we obtain for the energy @xmath112 of the fully projected ground state of the two - electron single qd , @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 @xmath116 and @xmath117 being the @xmath43 and @xmath44 ss - uhf orbitals rotated by an angle @xmath118 , respectively . @xmath119 and @xmath120 are two - body matrix elements of the coulomb repulsion .. in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ engvb ] ) @xmath121 and @xmath122 . ]  observe that @xmath112 represents a rotational average over all the possible orientations of the electron molecule and that @xmath123 coincides with the expression ( [ engvb ] ) for the energy @xmath67 of the covalently bonded h@xmath0-qdm .    to further examine how closely expression ( 9 ) describes the ground state of the he - qd </S>",
    "<S> , we display in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 the energy deviations of the four approximation steps ( i.e. , rhf , ss - uhf , sp , and s&amp ) from the exact ( ex ) @xcite ground state , as a function of the dielectric constant @xmath2 . </S>",

    "<S> the curve labeled rhf gives the correlation energy . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of parameters is : parabolic confinement @xmath124 mev , and effective mass @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=253 ]   +    the correlation energy , @xmath125 , is defined as the difference between the rhf ground - state energy and the exact one , and thus it coincides with the top curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 denoted as rhf . </S>",
    "<S> the ordering ( from top to bottom ) of the curves in fig .  3 reflects the fact that each subsequent approximation step captures successively a larger portion of the total correlations , and thus lowers the total energy . </S>",
    "<S> from fig .  3 , one sees that there are two correlation regimes : in the regime of weak correlations , the three lower curves collapse onto the rhf one ; naturally , this regime corresponds to the normal fermi liquid and extends to @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of strong correlations and of symmetry - broken hf solutions occurs at @xmath127 @xmath128 and extends to @xmath129 .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the percentage , @xmath130 , of correlations with respect to the exact energy is 6.8% and 49.5% for @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values are much higher than the values encountered in natural atoms ; for this reason , 2d qd s are referred to as strongly correlated systems . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is not surprising that the rhf error in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 grows exponentially for stronger correlations ( smaller @xmath2 or larger @xmath91 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is remarkable that the s&amp approximation ( where all symmetries have been restored ) converges to the exact result for smaller @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the exact ground - state energy is 19.80 mev for @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and 51.83 mev for @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) , resulting for the s&amp in a relative error of 4% and 0.7% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> , the fraction of correlation energy captured by the successive approximations is : ss - uhf 44.4% , sp 57.2% , and s&amp 73.1% ; the corresponding values for @xmath132 are : 94.5% , 94.5% , and 98.5% . ]  </S>",
    "<S> these results are in agreement with the experience from nuclear physics , where it has been found @xcite that the vbp yields reliable results in the case of strong symmetry breaking ( strongly deformed nuclei ) .    </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the sp curve collapses onto the ss - uhf one for @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior defines @xcite an intermediate regime , see pichard j - l et al _ cond - mat/0107380_. ]  between the fermi - liquid and the regime of strongly crystallized wigner molecules ( @xmath134 ) . in the latter regime , </S>",
    "<S> the overlap ( @xmath73 ) between the antipodally localized electron orbitals is very small , such that the ss - uhf energy is not effectively lowered by the spin projection ( sp ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the ss - uhf method in conjunction with the companion step of restoration of the spin and space symmetries via projection techniques ( when such symmetries are broken ) can provide appropriate semianalytical wave functions for an accurate description of strongly correlated electrons in artificial atoms and molecules .    </S>",
