    "wireless sensor networks ( wsns ) employ numerous sensors deployed in target environments to gather sensing data via wireless links . in the conventional wsns , installation placement of sensor nodes operated by electrical plug",
    "are restricted by limited placements of the plugs .",
    "employing electrical batteries instead can release wsns from the wired cables however increase the cost for battery replacement .",
    "therefore , the demand of battery - less sensor nodes has been increasing in wsns .",
    "one of the battery - less solutions is energy harvesting from light source@xcite , rf ( radio frequency ) @xcite , vibration @xcite and so on .",
    "however , the ambient energy source is easily influenced by the surrounding environment .",
    "for example , light source can only be employed in the daytime and vibration source needs to be triggered by the external force e.g. pushing by human finger .    to overcome the power supply problem ,",
    "a system called wireless grid to supply wireless energy to sensor nodes has been proposed @xcite .",
    "wireless energy transmission schemes are categorized into three types , i.e. radio wave emission , resonant coupling , and inductive coupling @xcite . in the radio wave emission method , power emitted from the wireless energy transmitter attenuates in proportion to the distance .",
    "however , the attenuation can be compensated by enhancing antenna gain .",
    "the most important advantage of this scheme is that it can supply energy to unrestricted numbers of sensors without any strict knowledge of sensor locations .",
    "since our study focuses on supplying wireless energy to ubiquitous sensor nodes distributed in indoor environments , the radio wave emission approach is employed .",
    "radio wave emission technology has long been employed in rfid ( radio frequency identification ) systems to manage products in the factories .",
    "however , the wireless energy transmission systems were not designed to achieve the ubiquitous coverage demanded of the wireless grid . in single transmitter",
    "( tx ) systems , the coverage of energy supply field is restricted by the maximum transmit power or eirp ( equivalent isotropic radiated power ) defined by radio regulation . to extend the coverage , multiple txs",
    "are introduced to the systems .",
    "however , interference can occur between multiple txs .",
    "once multiple txs simultaneously transmit radio wave , destructive interference occurs and creates deadspots where sensor nodes can not be charged and activated . to deal with this problem",
    ", we proposed to introduce carrier shift diversity ( csd ) to the multi - point system @xcite@xcite .",
    "since the csd creates artificial fading and the instantaneous received power fluctuates against the required power for activating sensor node , capacitor playing the role of rechargeable battery is introduced to average the received power over the period of artificial fading .    in our previous works @xcite@xcite",
    ", we conducted indoor experiments performed in a three dimensional space of an empty room by measuring only the propagation characteristics using a receiving antenna of ic tag and spectrum analyzer .",
    "the experimental results showed that the multi - point wireless energy transmission with csd can mitigate power attenuation due to the path - loss as well as the effect of standing - wave created by multipath and interference between multiple wave sources .",
    "however , in these papers , the coverage of sensor activation was not confirmed with real battery - less sensor nodes . in the scenario of real battery - less sensor node , rf /",
    "dc conversion efficiency is non - linear against received power and the consumed power varies according to the activation status of the sensor node . therefore , @xcite@xcite could not prove the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of activating real battery - less sensor nodes . in this paper",
    ", we develop battery - less sensor node composed of off - the - shelf devices and conduct indoor experiments by using the developed sensor node . in the experiments ,",
    "we measure both received power and sensor activation using the developed battery - less sensor node whose consumed power and required power to activate sensor node are respectively @xmath2w and @xmath3w .",
    "the experimental results show that the coverage of sensor activation of the single - point scheme , the simple multi - point scheme without csd , and the proposed multi - point scheme are 84.4% , 83.7% , and 100% respectively . in this paper , the details of the developed battery - less sensor node , measurement scheme , and measurement results",

    "it is noted that the frequency bandwidth in the case of csd is as same as that in the cases of sp and mp because csd merely divides the original dedicated channel into the subcarriers .          in order to understand the effectiveness of the proposed multi - point scheme ,",
