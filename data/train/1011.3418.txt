    "the cosmological observations , interpreted in terms of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model , suggest that the universe underwent an accelerated expansion at least twice in its history . the first one is called the cosmic inflation and it is specific to the very early universe @xcite .",
    "the second one is the presently observed dark energy domination area @xcite . in both cases the evolution",
    "can be explained , to some extent , by a constant or nearly - constant contribution to the energy density modeled by the so - called cosmological constant @xmath2 . in gravitational physics one",

    "in particular , we quantize the space _ volume _ function to find the relation between @xmath2 and the length @xmath1 specifying loop geometry underlying lqc . in",
    "what follows , we consider a flat frw model with the cosmological constant and a free scalar field .    in standard lqc",
    "one applies the dirac quantization method @xcite , which postpones solution of the hamiltonian constraints to the quantum level . in the nonstandard lqc",
    "one solves constraints already at the classical level and quantization is carried out on the _ physical _ phase space .",
    "it is called the reduced phase space quantization method .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to the frw @xcite and the bianchi i @xcite models with a free scalar field .",

    "it is instructive to check the value of @xmath86 in the observed universe .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath2 can be related with the observed dark energy , which dominates the energy density of the universe . in this case",
    "one can rewrite the definition of @xmath32 parameter in the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fractional density of the cosmological constant , and @xmath89 is the present value of the hubble parameter .",
    "the five years of observations of the wmap satellite yield @xmath90 and @xmath91 @xcite . assuming that @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the planck length and @xmath94 @xcite , we find @xmath95 because this value is extremely small , the value of @xmath86 with the high precision overlaps with @xmath96 , obtained in the @xmath34 limit",
    ". therefore @xmath97 , where we have assumed @xmath92 , as previously . with @xmath98 , the quanta of volume takes a value @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a planck volume .",
    "we propose to relate the quantum of the volume @xmath86 , defined by ( [ gap ] ) , with the volume @xmath23 of an _ elementary _ lattice cell as follows @xmath101 which leads to the equation @xmath102    because @xmath103 , it is clear that @xmath104 , where @xmath105 .",
    "therefore ( [ l2 ] ) leads to the constraint on the value of @xmath1 from below .",
    "the minimum value @xmath106 corresponds to the case @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ post ] ) is analogous to the equation postulated in standard lqc for the determination of the _ minimum _ length of a loop along which the holonomy is defined .",
    "one requires that the area of the minimum loop in lqc equals the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the area operator of loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in our case we make the postulate at the _ physical _ sector of lqc , contrary to the case of @xcite where one compares the corresponding quantities from lqc and lqg in the _ kinematical _ sector of both theories .",
    "equation ( [ l2 ] ) can be inverted into the form @xmath107 where @xmath104 as shown previously . this way we have turned the cosmological constant @xmath2 into a _ variable _ cosmological constant , a function depending explicitly on @xmath1 .",
    "one may treat the relation ( [ lam ] ) as an analogue of the expression for the vacuum energy obtained within the framework of quantum field theory .",
    "namely , the vacuum energy may be estimated by summing up energies of the zero modes down to some cut - off length scale @xmath108 .",
    "therefore , for the cosmological constant interpreted as a vacuum energy , one gets @xmath109 here , @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the number of bosons and fermions , respectively .",
    "the value of cosmological constant is explicitly expressed in terms of some minimal length scale @xmath108 .",
    "substitution @xmath112 leads however to the known problem of the large vale of cosmological constant , @xmath113 ( that can be `` solved '' by imposing the condition of supersymmetry @xmath114 , which leads to @xmath115 ) .",
    "now , let us make use of the relation ( [ lam ] ) .",
    "it is helpful to expand ( [ lam ] ) in terms of @xmath116 , where @xmath117 .",
    "so we get @xmath118 we can see that the value of our cosmological constant is also proportional to @xmath119",
    ". however , there is additional factor @xmath120 , that can be used to match @xmath2 with the observed value . from the observations we have that @xmath121 , which leads to @xmath122",
    ". the value of @xmath1 must be therefore very close to @xmath123 in order to reproduce observed value of the cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the field theoretical approach to @xmath2 , in our case , the observed value of @xmath2 can be obtained for discretization scale @xmath124 ! to examine the relation @xmath125 in more details",
    ", we introduce the @xmath126function ( it should be not confused with the canonical variable @xmath22 ) as follows @xmath127 this function is defined in analogy to the @xmath126function in the renormalization group theory @xcite .",
    "however , in our case , this function is only a tool that we use to visualize the scale dependence .",
    "we plot the resulting @xmath126function in fig .",
    "[ rgf ] .    .",
    "the arrows indicate flow from uv ( @xmath128 ) to ir limit ( @xmath129 ) . the dotted part of the curve denotes the region of large @xmath1 ( @xmath130 ) where considerations become speculative . in the plot @xmath131 and @xmath132,width=264 ]",
    "one can see that on the very small scale , @xmath2 grows from @xmath133 at the first fixed point @xmath106 , and approaches the maximum @xmath134 at the second fixed point @xmath135 . in the high energy domain ( small @xmath1 ) the value of @xmath2 grows from zero to the planck scale level .",
    "while approaching the largest scales with growing @xmath1 , the value of the cosmological constant tends to zero again , @xmath136 .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that as @xmath1 grows , our lattice interpretation becomes less and less justified , and it does not make sense as @xmath137 .    using the above arguing one may suggest that , in a sense , cosmological constant can be interpreted as a running coupling constant . in such an interpretation , @xmath1 is treated as a scale at which the high energy degrees of freedom are integrated . however , systematic verification of this suggestion is needed .",
    "we believe that our considerations give some hints which can stimulate further investigations in this direction .",
    "in this paper we present quantization of the frw model with the cosmological constant and the free scalar field in the framework of the nonstandard loop quantum cosmology .",
    "we investigate spectral properties of the volume operator .",
    "we find the eigenfunctions as well as corresponding spectrum which is shown to be discrete . based on this",
    ", we find an expression for the elementary quanta of volume as a function of cosmological constant @xmath2 . in the limit @xmath74",
    ", our formula reduces to the expression that was found earlier in @xcite for the @xmath34 case .    postulating the relation of the quantum of a space volume with the volume of a lattice cell",
    ", we express the cosmological constant @xmath2 in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "based on this we _ suggest _ that @xmath2 may play the role of a running constant similar to the coupling constant in qcd which decreases with increasing energy scale . in the ir limit ( where our model is little justified ) , @xmath2 behaves similarly to the fine structure constant in qed .",
    "we are conscious that our dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath1 is not a renormalization group flow in any _ standard _ sense .",
    "the renormalization group in quantum field theory comes from integrating out high energy degrees of freedom and requiring that this be compensated by changes in the coupling constants .",
    "we simply put forward a _",
    "hypothesis _ of interpreting @xmath2 as a running constant to be verified by future studies of the nature of the cosmological constant .",
    "the free parameter @xmath1 , of the classical level , can be restricted after quantization by making use of ( [ l2 ] ) . as it was shown earlier",
    ", the _ lowest _ allowed value of @xmath1 equals @xmath106 . for this value , the corresponding critical energy density @xmath138 , for @xmath139 ( see , @xcite )",
