    "a well - known method to compute the galois group @xmath1 of a number field ( e.g. , of the splitting field of a polynomial @xmath2 $ ] with integral coefficients ) can be described roughly as follows : ( 1 ) find a group @xmath0 which contains @xmath1 , e.g. , because of symmetry considerations ( 2 ) this group @xmath0 is our `` guess '' for @xmath1 , and we try to prove that @xmath3 by reducing modulo successive primes , using the fact that the frobenius automorphisms give _ conjugacy classes _ in the galois group @xmath1 , and hence conjugacy classes in @xmath0 .    if the guess in ( 1 ) was right , and if one is patient enough in ( 2 ) that the conjugacy classes observed are only compatible with the galois group being our candidate @xmath0 , then we have succeeded .",
    "this method is particularly simple when @xmath0 is `` guessed '' to be the symmetric group acting on the roots of the polynomial : it can lead quickly to examples of equations with this galois group . in general , however this is not the most efficient algorithm ( if only because the first step ( 1 ) is hard to formalize ! ) , and thus computer algebra systems use other techniques .",
    "still , this method is well - suited for certain theoretical investigations , for instance for probabilistic galois theory ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and it can be surprisingly efficient even for fairly complicated groups ( see for instance our joint works  @xcite and  @xcite with f. jouve , for a case where the weyl group of the exceptional lie group @xmath4 is the galois group involved , and for for further developments along these lines ) .    in view of this , it is somewhat surprising that no general study of the efficiency of the underlying algorithm seems to have been performed . among the very few references we know is a paper of dixon  @xcite , who considers informally the case of the symmetric groups @xmath5 and mentions some earlier work of mckay . on the other hand ,",
    "there has been a fair amount of interest in the question of determining the probability that a tuple of elements generate a finite group , which is the analogue problem where conjugacy is ignored , see for instance the paper  @xcite of kantor and lubotzky .",
    "the paper  @xcite of c. pomerance considers the question for abelian groups , when the conjugacy issue is also irrelevant , and his results do apply to our setting . the current paper will provide the beginning of the theoretical analysis of this type of algorithm for general finite groups . as a specific result",
    ", we will prove the following result ( informally stated ; theorem  [ th - cheb - symmetric ] gives the precise statement using the definitions of section  [ sec - chebotarev ] ) :    [ th - intro ] there exists a constant @xmath6 with the following property : for all integers @xmath7 , the average number of independently , randomly chosen conjugacy classes of the symmetric group @xmath5 one must pick before ensuring that any tuple of elements taken from each of these classes generate @xmath5 , is at most @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath9 , there exists @xmath10 such that the average of the @xmath11-th power of this number is bounded by @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .    here is the rough outline of this work :",
    "we consider probabilistic models in section  [ sec - chebotarev ] , and define an invariant , which we call the _ chebotarev invariant _ of a finite group , using such a model ( the name , based on the chebotarev density theorem , is justified in section  [ sec - arith ] ) ; it makes precise the informal notion in the statement of theorem  [ th - intro ] .",
    "computing this invariant is seen to be related to very interesting questions of group theory , independently of any arithmetic motivation . in section  [ sec - ex1 ] ,",
    "we indicate how to compute this invariant for abelian groups ( based on pomerance s work ) and in section  [ sec - solvable ] we consider solvable groups of a certain `` extremal '' type . in sections",
    "[ sec - non - ab-2 ] ,  [ sec - sym - alt ] and  [ sec - ex2 ] , we consider theoretical and numerical examples for non - abelian , often non - solvable , groups  in particular alternating and symmetric groups , proving theorem  [ th - intro ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec - arith ] makes some informal remarks concerning the applicability of our results to arithmetic situations ( the original motivation ) ; as we will see , there are non - trivial difficulties involved , and we hope to come back to these questions later .    * notation .",
    "* as usual , @xmath14 denotes the cardinality of a set , and @xmath15 is a field with @xmath16 elements . if @xmath0 is a finite group , and @xmath17 , we write @xmath18    we write @xmath19 for the set of conjugacy classes of @xmath0 , and for @xmath20 , we also write @xmath21 or @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the union of all conjugacy classes in @xmath25 .    in fact , as a matter of convenience , we will usually denote in the same way a subset of conjugacy classes and the corresponding set of elements in @xmath0 , unless it is not clear in context if @xmath26 means that @xmath8 is a conjugacy class or an element of @xmath0 ( we will write often @xmath27 for a conjugacy class , avoiding most ambiguity ) .",
    "we recall that a geometric random variable @xmath28 with parameter @xmath29 $ ] on a probability space is a random variable taking almost surely values in the set of positive integers , with @xmath30 for @xmath9 .",
    "we then have @xmath31    by @xmath32 for @xmath33 , or @xmath34 for @xmath33 , where @xmath28 is an arbitrary set on which @xmath35 is defined , we mean synonymously that there exists a constant @xmath36 such that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "the `` implied constant '' refers to any value of @xmath25 for which this holds .",
    "it may depend on the set @xmath28 , which is usually specified explicitly , or clearly determined by the context .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 means that @xmath32 and @xmath40 on the same set . on the other hand @xmath41",
    "as @xmath42 means that @xmath43 as @xmath42 .",
    "in this section , we describe a natural probabilistic model for the recognition algorithm described previously .",
    "fix a finite group @xmath0 .",
    "we first remark that , whereas it does not make sense to say that a conjugacy class lies in a certain subgroup , unless the latter is a normal subgroup , it does make sense to say that it lies in a conjugacy class of subgroups . with that in mind , we define :    let @xmath0 be a finite group , and let @xmath44 be a subset of conjugacy classes in @xmath0",
    ". then @xmath25 _ generates _",
    "@xmath0 if , for any choice of representatives @xmath45 for @xmath46 , the elements of the tuple @xmath47 generate @xmath0 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath25 generates @xmath0 if and only if there is no ( proper ) maximal subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath0 that has non - empty intersection with each of the @xmath48 .",
    "_ invariably generate _",
    "@xmath0 if their conjugacy classes generate @xmath0 in the sense above . ]",
    "the equivalence of the two definitions is quite clear contrapositively : if there are @xmath49 which generate a proper subgroup @xmath50 , then each @xmath48 intersects any maximal proper subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath0 that contains @xmath50 , and conversely .",
    "note also that the second condition can be stated by saying that there is a conjugacy class of maximal subgroups containing @xmath25 .",
    "the following well - known lemma ( due to jordan ) is the basic fact underlying the whole technique :    [ lm - triv ] let @xmath0 be a finite group",
    ". then the set @xmath19 of conjugacy classes generates @xmath1 . in other words",
    ", there is no proper subgroup of @xmath0 which contains a representative from each conjugacy class .",
    "simple as this is , one should also recall at this point that the analogue of this lemma is false for infinite groups ( even compact groups , such as @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) ; for further discussion of various interpretations of this lemma , see  @xcite .",
    "now , let @xmath53 be a fixed probability space with a sequence @xmath54 of @xmath0-valued random variables @xmath55 and let @xmath56 be the conjugacy class of @xmath57 in @xmath19 : those are @xmath19-valued random variables .    intuitively , those @xmath58 are the conjugacy classes that we see coming `` one by one '' ; the chebotarev invariant(s ) looks at when we get enough information to conclude that those conjugacy classes can not all belong to some proper subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "we now define a random variable @xmath59 ( a _ waiting time _ ) by @xmath60.\\ ] ]    this depends on the sequence @xmath61 , and it may be always infinite ( e.g. , if @xmath62 for all @xmath13 ! ) .",
    "but it is , in an intuitive sense , the `` finest '' invariant in terms of this probabilistic model . to obtain more compact and purely numerical invariants , it is natural to first take the expectation ; this takes values in @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finite group , @xmath61 a sequence of @xmath0-valued random variables and @xmath59 the waiting time above .",
    "the _ chebotarev invariant _ of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath28 , denoted @xmath64 , is the expectation @xmath65 of this random variable .",
    "we focused on conjugacy classes because this is how applications to galois theory are likely to arise , but of course one can similarly define an invariant using the original random elements @xmath66 in @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is abelian , the two coincide .    to have an unambiguously defined invariant , we must use a specific choice of sequence @xmath66 .",
    "the natural model is that of independent , uniformly distributed elements in @xmath0 : if @xmath66 are independent and identically uniformly distributed @xmath0-valued random variables , so that @xmath67 and hence @xmath68 then we call @xmath64 _ the _ chebotarev invariant , and we just write @xmath69 .",
    "it may be of interest , at least for numerical purposes , to use a sequence @xmath66 which is not independent , but is obtained , for instance , by a rapidly mixing random walk on @xmath0 .",
    "also , the arithmetic analogue for computing galois groups may be interpreted as involving non - independent and non - uniform choices of conjugacy classes ( see section  [ sec - arith ] ) .",
    "other numerical invariants may of course be derived from @xmath59 , starting from the higher moments @xmath70 for @xmath9 . since it is probabilistically most important , when the expectation of a random variable is known , to also have a control of its second moment , we define formally the _ secondary chebotarev invariant _ :    let @xmath0 be a finite group , @xmath61 a sequence of @xmath0-valued random variables , and let @xmath59 be the waiting time above .",
    "the _ secondary chebotarev invariant _ of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath28 , is the second moment @xmath71 .",
    "if @xmath66 is a sequence of independent , uniformly distributed random variables , then we write @xmath72 and call it _ the _ secondary chebotarev invariant .",
    "we will now give formulas for the two chebotarev invariants ( in the independent case ) , which are expressed purely in terms of group - theoretic information .",
    "this is useful for explicit computations , at least for groups which are very well understood ( but often the probabilistic origin of @xmath69 should also be kept in mind . )    to state the formulas , we must introduce the following data and notation about @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath73 be the set of conjugacy classes of ( proper ) maximal subgroups of @xmath0 ( if @xmath0 is trivial , this is empty ) ; for a conjugacy class of of maximal subgroups @xmath74 , let @xmath75 denote the set of conjugacy classes @xmath25 of @xmath0 which `` occur in @xmath76 '' , i.e. , such that @xmath77 for _ some _ @xmath50 in the conjugacy class @xmath76 .. ] moreover , if @xmath78 is a set of conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups , we let @xmath79 the set of conjugacy classes of @xmath0 which appear in all subgroups in @xmath80 .",
    "then we have :    [ pr - comput ] let @xmath0 be a _",
    "non - trivial _ finite group . with notation as above , we have @xmath81 and @xmath82    these formulas do not apply for the trivial group , since they lead to empty sums which are zero , whereas the definition leads to @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "probabilists will have noticed that the first formula ( at least ) is very similar to the one for the expectation of the waiting time for a general coupon collector problem .",
    "there is indeed a link , which is provided by the next lemma where independence of the random elements @xmath57 is not required .",
    "[ lm - link ] let @xmath0 be a non - trivial finite group and @xmath61 a sequence of @xmath0-valued random variables .",
    "the waiting time @xmath59 is equal to @xmath85 where @xmath86 note that @xmath87 depends also on @xmath28 .    in other words",
    ", @xmath59 is also the maximal @xmath13 such that we need to look at @xmath88 for @xmath89 up to @xmath13 , before we witness , for every conjugacy class @xmath76 of maximal subgroups , some @xmath57 which is incompatible with the groups in this class @xmath76 .",
    "this is very close to a coupon collector problem ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a general description of this type of problems ) , where the `` coupons '' we need to collect correspond to the conjugacy classes which are not in @xmath75 , as @xmath76 ranges over @xmath73 .",
    "but since a single @xmath57 may serve as coupon for more than one @xmath75 , this does not exactly correspond to standard coupon collector problems . because of this , we state and prove the following general abstract result , which may have other applications .",

    "the integral expression  ( [ eq - integrale ] ) is a consequence of  ( [ eq - expect - collect ] ) and the additivity of measure for disjoint sets : it suffices to expand the product and use @xmath114    finally , to compute the second moment in the independent case , we start with the same formula  ( [ eq - incl - excl ] ) to get @xmath115    we first transform this by applying  ( [ eq - prod - geom ] ) in lemma  [ lm - prod - geom ] below to compute @xmath116 .",
    "this gives @xmath117    to continue , consider more generally arbitrary complex coefficients @xmath118 defined for @xmath95 , and the expression @xmath119 note that @xmath120 is a simple combination of two such expressions .",
    "we proceed to reduce @xmath121 to a single sum over @xmath113 by rearranging the sum according to the value of @xmath122 : @xmath123    the inner sum is rearranged in turn as @xmath124 since the subsets @xmath125 with @xmath126 are parametrized by @xmath127 using the correspondence @xmath128 with inverse @xmath129 .    for fixed @xmath80 , the last summation condition @xmath130",

    "note the following strange - looking `` linearity '' property , which can be checked from our formulas and  ( [ eq - prod - geom ] ) : for @xmath140 , we have @xmath141    these formulas can only be useful for practical computation if the number of conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of @xmath0 is fairly small , or if they are very well understood . as a theoretical instrument , they suffer from the fact that it is very hard to use them to guess or estimate the actual value of @xmath69 .",
    "for instance , it is not clear how to recover even the trivial lower bound @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the minimal cardinality of a generating set of @xmath0 .",

    "another natural formula is @xmath144 which is also valid for @xmath145 .    indeed ,",
    "since @xmath146 takes positive integer values , we have the familiar formula @xmath147 and clearly @xmath148 for @xmath7 . when @xmath149 , this is the certain event , with probability one , thus leading to  ( [ eq - formula - probas ] ) .",
    "a moment s thought shows that one can also identify this formula with the one coming from  ( [ eq - comput ] ) by expanding the geometric series : @xmath150 ( where the term with @xmath151 is only equal to @xmath152 for @xmath153 , i.e. , @xmath140 ) .",
    "this is not really a different proof of proposition  [ pr - comput ] since the relation @xmath154 is proved by inclusion - exclusion , exactly as in the proof of proposition  [ pr - collect ] .",
    "the point of  ( [ eq - formula - probas ] ) is rather that it leads to another lower bound ( for @xmath140 ) : @xmath155 for any fixed @xmath9 , and this may be quite useful because there has been a large amount of work on the estimation of those probabilities when @xmath11 is small , e.g. , @xmath156 if @xmath0 is not cyclic .",
    "for instance , dixon ( for @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) and kantor and lubotzky ( for @xmath159 a simple classical group and @xmath160 ) have shown that in those cases we have @xmath161 as @xmath13 ( resp .",
    "@xmath16 ) goes to infinity , indeed with quantitative estimates ( see  @xcite )  but note the probabilities with elements and with conjugacy classes may behave rather differently ( e.g. , for @xmath162 , the probability that two random elements generate @xmath0 is very close to @xmath152 for large @xmath163 , but there is a probability converging to @xmath164 that two random conjugacy classes do not generate @xmath0 , see the proof of theorem  [ th - psl ] ) . in a sense ,",
    "the chebotarev invariant is thus a refinement of these type of probabilities .",

    "of course in practice , one usually considers the ( non - random ) sequence @xmath646 , @xmath647 , @xmath648 , @xmath649 .",

    ", we can define chebotarev invariants for the family @xmath654 by averaging : @xmath661    the basic arithmetic question is then : for a given family , is it true that @xmath662 is , for @xmath663 sufficiently large at least , close to @xmath69 ( and similarly for the secondary chebotarev invariant ) ?",
    "the basic reason one can expect this is the chebotarev density theorem  ( [ eq - cheb - density ] ) .",
    "we want to point out a few difficulties that definitely arise in trying to make this precise .",
    "first of all , quantifying the chebotarev density theorem is _ hard _ : it almost immediately runs into issues related to the generalized riemann hypothesis ; even in the seemingly trivial case where @xmath664 ( quadratic extensions of @xmath464 ) , the basic question of estimating the size of the smallest prime @xmath163 for which the corresponding frobenius is non - trivial , i.e. , the smallest quadratic non - residue modulo @xmath163 , in terms of the discriminant of the field , is unsolved ( see , e.g. ,  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop . 5.22 , th .",
    "7.16 ) for conditional and uncontional results in that case ) .",
    "this is a problem because if we sum with uniform weight , a single `` bad '' field @xmath665 can destroy any chance of approaching the chebotarev invariant . indeed : note that in that case @xmath666 where @xmath667 is the index of the first non - trivial frobenius conjugacy class . in the current state of knowledge",
    ", it can be that there exists @xmath665 with @xmath668 for some constant @xmath669 ( see  @xcite ) ; on the other hand , if the family @xmath654 is defined as that of splitting fields of monic polynomials of degree @xmath13 , and the subfamily @xmath657 is that of polynomials of height @xmath670 , then we know that most @xmath671 have galois group @xmath522 , that @xmath672 if @xmath663 is an integer , and the discriminant is obviously often also _ at least _ a power of @xmath663 . thus  ( [ eq - bad ] ) might already be bad enough to preclude any comparison . on the other hand , on the riemann hypothesis , we have @xmath673 ( where the implied constant depends on @xmath0 ) , and the problem would then be alleviated .",
    "another issue is that one can not expect , as stated , to have @xmath674 for interesting families for the simple reason that the statistic of small primes is typically _ not _ the uniform one , i.e. , if we fix a prime @xmath163 , we can not expect to have @xmath675 even if we assume that all the fields involved are unramified at @xmath163 .",

    "in particular , not even the relative frequencies are preserved ! on the other hand , it is well - known that if @xmath163 is increasing , the discrepancy between the distribution of the factorization patterns of squarefree polynomials modulo @xmath163 and the density of conjugacy classes disappears : we have @xmath696\\,\\mid\\ , \\text{$f$ squarefree of degree    $ n$ with $ \\operatorname{\\mathrm{fr}}_f = c^{\\sharp}$ } \\}| \\sim \\nu_{g}(c^{\\sharp})\\ ] ] uniformly for all conjugacy classes @xmath697 .",
    "this suggests that it is likely that one can prove some relevant results : one would consider some increasing starting point @xmath698 and a modified waiting time @xmath699 and hope to prove ( possibly under the generalized riemann hypothesis , possibly unconditionally after throwing away a few `` bad '' fields ) that @xmath700 for suitable @xmath701 .",
