    "the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory @xcite has been a successful approach to describing properties of nuclei along the stability line as well as far away from it @xcite . due to the dirac - lorentz structure of spin - orbit interaction ,",
    "it has been shown to be advantageous over the conventional non - relativistic skyrme theory in describing properties such as anomalous isotope shifts in pb nuclei @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that an isospin dependence of the spin - orbit interaction or essentially a lack of it is responsible for the anomalous behaviour of the isotope shifts .",
    "the non - relativistic approaches based upon the skyrme and gogny forces have been unable to reproduce the kink @xcite . on the other hand , by significant alterations in the isospin dependence of the spin - orbit potential in the skyrme theory @xcite , it becomes possible to describe the above anomaly in isotope shifts .",
    "the prevalent model within the rmf theory is that of non - linear couplings of @xmath0 meson @xcite . herein , the nonlinear scalar self - couplings of @xmath0 meson play a pivotal role in describing finite nuclei .",
    "it was realized earlier on @xcite that @xmath3 + @xmath4 terms have ingredients appropriate for a proper description of the surface properties of nuclei . by virtue of this ,",
    "the scalar self - coupling terms have become indispensable for finite nuclei .",
    "one of the first nuclear forces constructed for calculation of ground - state properties of finite nuclei was nl1 @xcite",
    ". a larger value of the asymmetry energy of nl1 , however , made its application to nuclei far away from the stability line difficult . within this model ,",
    "one of the first successful nuclear forces was nl - sh @xcite which was obtained with a significant improvement in the asymmetry energy .",
    "the force nl - sh has an incompressibility of nuclear matter which is on the higher side of physical acceptable region .",
    "sunsequently , force nl3 was obtained @xcite with an improvement in the nuclear incompressibility of nuclear matter .",
    "this has in meanwhile become successful in several respects .",
    "a problem that afflicts the model with @xmath3 + @xmath4 , in general , is that it gives an equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear and neutron matter that is very stiff .",
    "consequently , it is considered as incompatible with the observed spectrum of neutron star masses .",
    "a quartic term @xmath5 was added recently to the above model that was intended to improve the shell effects in nuclei @xcite .",
    "it has subsequently been shown that the addition of the vector self - coupling of @xmath1 meson has the advantage of softening the eos of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "variations in the relativistic approach based upon point - coupling model @xcite or of density - dependent meson couplings @xcite have been made . with the inclusion of a larger number of parameters a good degree of success",
    "has been achieved @xcite",
    ". there has also been significant discussion on the use of the effective field theoretical approach based upon expansion of the interaction lagrangian in higher order terms in fields @xcite .",
    "addition of higher order terms and cross terms between the fields are shown to improve description of properties of finite nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , a coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath6 meson has shown to be promising in reduction of neutron skin to reasonably accepted values as well as for obtaining a softer eos of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "thus , within the effective lagrangian approach , the field of the rmf theory has become widely open with many possibilities of interaction terms .",
    "it is , however , not known as to what form of density dependence of nucleon - meson interactions or of meson - meson interactions would be the most suitable one . in other words ,",
    "which terms nature prefers in the expansion scheme is not known a priori .",
    "emergence of nuclear data in extreme regions of the periodic table including those on finite nuclei , giant resonances and neutron star masses put nuclear interactions to test .    with the initial success of the rmf theory in nuclear structure ,",
    "there is thus a strong need to construct a theory that should be appropriate for broader aspects of finite nuclei as well as for nuclear matter .",
    "as improved and refined predictions of nuclear properties especially the masses ( binding energies ) of nuclei are required for regions often very far away from the stability line such as those for r - process nucleosynthesis , it is pertinent to devise new models and approaches to deliver the same .",
    "this may include other degrees of freedom or alternative forms of interactions .    in this work ,",
    "we have explored the rmf lagrangian in the effective lagrangian approach with a limited number of terms in the expansion with a view to see as to whether such an approach is feasible .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to a meson - meson interaction term between @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "specifically , we have added a coupling of the form @xmath7 , in addition to the @xmath3 + @xmath4 couplings which have so far been the most important terms in the rmf lagrangian and are indispensable for finite nuclei and nuclear matter .",
    "the basic ( linear ) rmf lagrangian that describes nucleons as dirac spinors interacting with the meson fields is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the bare nucleon mass and @xmath10 is its dirac spinor .",
    "nucleons interact with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath6 mesons , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the respective coupling constants . the photonic field is represented by the electromagnetic vector @xmath14 .",
    "the nonlinear @xmath0-meson - couplings added by boguta and bodmer @xcite are of the form @xmath15 the parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the nonlinear couplings of @xmath0-meson in the conventional @xmath3 + @xmath4 model .",
    "the effective lagrangian that is commonly used is @xmath18 here , we add an interaction term between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson . then , the effective lagrangian becomes @xmath19 the last term represents the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson that we introduce .",
    "the constant @xmath20 is the coupling constant of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson - meson interaction .",
    "the field tensors of the vector mesons and of the electromagnetic field take the following form : @xmath21 the variational principle gives rise to the dirac equation : @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the @xmath24 potential : @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the @xmath27 potential @xmath28 which defines the effective mass as given by @xmath29 the corresponding klein - gordon equations can be written as @xmath30 where , @xmath31 these equations imply an implicit density dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson masses .",
    "these density dependences are then responsible for the density dependence of nuclear interaction in a nucleus .",
    "this is in contrast to the nonrelativistic skyrme approach wherein the density functional is well - defined at the outset .",
    "an explicit density dependence of mesons has been introduced in refs .",
    "this approach requires several additional parameters besides the usual coupling constants in order to model a density dependence whose form is not known a priori .    for the case of an even - even nucleus with a time - reversal symmetry , the spatial components of the vector fields , and vanish .",
    "the klein - gordon equations for the meson fields are then time - independent inhomogeneous equations with the nucleon densities as sources : @xmath32 for the mean - field , the nucleon spinors provide the corresponding source terms : @xmath33 where the sums are taken over the valence nucleons only .",
    "the stationary state solutions @xmath34 are obtained from the coupled system of dirac and klein - gordon equations self - consistently .",
    "the solution of the dirac equation is obtained by using the method of oscillator expansion @xcite .",
    "the ground - state of the nucleus is described by a slater determinant @xmath35 of single - particle spinors @xmath34 ( i = 1,2, .... a ) .",
    "the centre - of - mass correction is added using the harmonic oscillator estimate : @xmath36",
    "the parameters of the new lagrangian model are obtained by fitting binding energies and charge radii of a set of nuclei within the rmf theory .",
    "the procedure has been described in ref .",
    "the nuclei included are @xmath37o , @xmath38ca , @xmath39ca , @xmath40zr , @xmath41sn , @xmath42sn , @xmath43sn , and @xmath44pb .",
    "the sn isotopes @xmath41sn , @xmath42sn and @xmath43sn are included with a view to take into account the broad range of isospin dependence of the nuclear interaction . for open - shell nuclei ,",
    "the pairing is included within the bcs scheme , where the pairing gaps are obtained from the experimental masses of neighbouring nuclei .",
    "the binding energies and charge radii of nuclei have been used as constraints .",
    "in addition , we have tagged the spin - orbit splitting of @xmath45 in @xmath37o . however , we have avoided putting explicit conditions or constraints on the nuclear matter properties .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath6 meson masses have been fixed at their empirical values .",
    "the procedure of obtaining the parameter sets of the new lagrangian is the same as that applied in obtaining other forces such as nl - sh and nl3 .",
    "it may recalled that the set nl3 was obtained by putting constraints explicitly on the nuclear matter properties as well .",
    ".the parameters of the lagrangian sig - om with the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons .",
    "the lagrangian sets with the non - linear scalar self - coupling nl - sh , nl3 are shown for comparison . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is interesting to note that sig - om with its slightly lower value of @xmath46 mev than that of nl3 provides gmr energies which are closer to the experimental data , especially those of @xmath40zr and @xmath44pb considered frequently in analyses . in comparison , nl3 with a higher value of @xmath47 mev underestimates the data by @xmath481 mev . generally , a force with a lower value of @xmath49 would yield smaller values of gmr energies .",
    "this difference in the predictions of sig - om and nl3 may be due to a difference in some finite size effect of a nucleus .",
    "the other two factors which play a role for gmr energies are the coulomb term and the asymmetry component . at present",
    ", it is difficult to estimate as to which factor brings about the apparent paradoxical behaviour of sig - om and nl3 .",
    "we believe that it may be due to a different surface component ( arising out of a different density dependence of the interactions ) in sig - om vis - a - vis nl3 .",
    "it will , therefore , be important to carry out calculations of surface incompressibility using the semi - infinite nuclear matter .",
    "these calculations are in progress .",
    "moreover , it is also to be seen as to what response the two lagrangian models provide in relativistic radom - phase approximation calculations of the breathing - mode gmr energies .",
    "the density dependence of the effective mass @xmath50 is to an extent a reflection of the density dependence of interactions in a nucleus , though it corresponds to that of the @xmath0 field to be exact",
    ". it would be instructive to see as to how @xmath50 changes with density in different lagrangian models .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the density dependence of @xmath50 for different lagrangian models . fig .",
    "3(a ) shows the effective mass @xmath50 for the density region of a nucleus up until a 4 - 5 times the saturation density .",
    "both nl - sh and nl3 bunch out together and show a small difference in the high density region .",
    "nl - sv1 splits out from nl - sh and nl3 at higher densities . in the high - density region , three forces nl - sh and nl3 with the scalar self - couplings and nl - sv1 with the scalar self - coupling along with the vector self - coupling exhibit a similar pattern of variation with density as seen in fig .",
    "the model sig - om with @xmath51 coupling , on the other hand , shows a density dependence that is different from that of nl - sh , nl3 and nl - sv1 and it is especially so in the high density region .",
    "the region of the density relevant to finite nuclei is shown in fig .",
    "the saturation point is indicated by a square in each case .",
    "both sig - om and nl - sv1 have a slightly larger @xmath50 than that of nl - sh and nl3 .",
    "it may be pointed out though that in each case the spin orbit splitting of @xmath37o is reproduced well and yet overall fits to finite nuclei lead to slightly different effective mass for each model .",
    "this is no coincidence that within the @xmath52 lagrangian model , the effective masses for nl - sh and nl3 are very close to each other .",
    "the variation in @xmath50 for these two forces in this region is also very similar . on the other hand , in the region of interest for finite nuclei ,",
    "it is seen clearly that sig - om shows a density dependence that deviates strongly from that of nl - sh and nl3 .",
    "this may possibly lead to a different features of surface with sig - om .",
    "detailed surface properties using various lagrangian models are in progress .",
    "it is a matter for further investigation as to whether this difference in density dependence leads to different predictions of breathing - mode energies with sig - om as discussed above .",
    "the eos of nuclear and neutron matter is important for structure and properties of neutron stars .",
    "there has recently been a significant discussion on eos of nuclear matter @xcite especially in view of recent observations of neutron stars which have been found to exist with masses in the vicinity of two solar masses or even more @xcite . in accordance with the known spectrum of neutron star masses which lie below",
    "@xmath53 1.8 solar mass ( @xmath54 ) , the conventional wisdom has been that a softer eos is required for describing the observed masses",
    ". however , recent discoveries of masses close to @xmath55 or more than @xmath55 seem to put new demands on the high - density eos of nuclear matter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the neutron star exo 0748 - 676 with mass @xmath56 has been reported .",
    "consequently , very soft eos for nuclear and neutron matter are ruled out .",
    "then , one requires an eos that should encompass even the heavier neutron star masses in the region of @xmath57 .    solving the equations for nuclear matter self - consistently",
    ", we have calculated the eos of nuclear and neutron matter with the new lagrangian model .",
    "the eos of nuclear matter with sig - om shows a significant softening at higher densities as compared to that of nl - sh and nl3 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) . the coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson does have a softening effect at higher densities .",
    "in contrast , eos with the @xmath3 + @xmath4 model is known to be stiff due to preponderance of @xmath1 term at higher densities .",
    "the corresponding eos for neutron matter is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "it can be seen that neutron eos due to sig - om is also softer than that for nl - sh and nl3 . for a comparison",
    ", we show the eos due to friedman and padharipande ( fp ) @xcite .",
    "the fp eos for nuclear as well as neutron matter is very soft and was intended to describe lower mass neutron stars with masses @xmath58 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "4 , the softening achieved by the @xmath51 coupling is not strong enough to match that of fp which is a very soft eos leading to smaller values of maximum mass of neutron stars @xcite . in view of new observations such as those of ref .",
    "@xcite , a softer eos in the high density region may not be required .",
    "it has to be seen from neutron - star structure calculations whether the eos due to sig - om which is neither as stiff as nl3 nor as soft as fp would be suitable for describing the newly observed neutron star masses .",
    "the lagrangian sig - om with the coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons in the rmf theory has been developed .",
    "we have explored the feasibility of adding the @xmath0-@xmath1 coupling in the rmf lagrangian .",
    "properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter have been explored with the model sig - om .",
    "it is shown that sig - om provides a very good description of the ground - state properties such as binding energies and charge radii of nuclei over a large range of isospin .",
    "taking the case of the isotopic chain of sn nuclei , it is shown that it describes the binding energies of nuclei between the two magic numbers @xmath59 and @xmath60 very well .",
    "it will be interesting to see in further investigations as to what implications this improvement in shell structural aspects may have in the other regions and most importantly in the regions close to the r - process path .",
    "the breathing - mode giant monopole resonance energies for a few nuclei have been calculated using the constrained gcm calculations .",
    "it is shown that the model sig - om with the incompressibility of nuclear matter @xmath61 mev describes the breathing - mode gmr energies well .",
    "a comparative analysis of breathing - mode gmr energies with the gcm approach in the rmf theory suggests that some finite - size effects with sig - om may be different than with lagrangians with nonlinear scalar self - couplings .",
    "it is important to carry out calculations with relativistic rpa approach to see as to whether such a feature would persist .",
    "this is a matter of further investigations and requires a detailed study .",
    "the equation of state of nuclear and neutron matter have been obtained with sig - om .",
    "a comparison is made with the eos obtained with the interactions within the nonlinear scalar self - coupling .",
    "as it is well - known , the latter model gives very stiff eos .",
    "the equation of state of nuclear and neutron matter obtained with the new lagrangian sig - om is significantly softer than that with non - linear scalar self - couplings ."
