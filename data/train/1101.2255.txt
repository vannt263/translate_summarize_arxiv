    "these simulations showed that the nonlinear evolution of the reconnection - plasmoid system involves complicated structures , such as slow shocks of the petschek outflow @xcite and various shocks around the plasmoid @xcite .",
    "recently , reconnection research has been rapidly developing in relativistic astrophysics , too.@xcite in this context @xcite carried out mhd simulations on relativistic magnetic reconnection .",
    "they discussed several shock structures that were not known in the nonrelativistic plasmoid physics : the postplasmoid vertical shocks and the shock - reflection structure in the plasmoid - front .",
    "it is known that reconnection is highly influenced by upstream conditions .",
    "one key parameter is the alfvn speed , which usually approximates the outflow jet speed .",
    "another key parameter is the plasma beta , the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure .",
    "as will be discussed later , it corresponds to the ratio of the alfvn velocity and the sound velocity .",
    "the beta is typically below the unity in the lower corona @xcite and the lobe ( upstream region ) of the magnetotail plasma sheet @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore fine structures of a plasmoid in fast reconnection when the upstream region consists of low - beta plasmas by using two - dimensional mhd simulations . employing a high - resolution shock - capturing ( hrsc ) code ,",
    "we successfully resolve a variety of shock structures .",
    "we confirm that the new shock structures in ref . similarly appear in the nonrelativistic regime .",
    "we further discuss the condition for these shocks , and argue that they are common features of plasmoids in the low - beta plasmas .",

    "as the time goes on , the plasmoid grows bigger and bigger as it travels to the @xmath30-direction .",
    "it seems that the macroscopic picture evolves self - similarly in later stages.@xcite this is because the resistive spot and the harris - sheet thickness become relatively smaller than the entire system , as the system grows larger .",

    "consequently , gas pressure drives plasma flows in the field - aligned directions .",

    "the reconnection inflows usually move to the @xmath83-directions , but they are accordingly modulated by the reverse flows ( fig .",

    "[ fig : snap]b ) .",

    "a similar effect is reported by @xcite , who claimed that deconfinement of the outflow channel leads to an adiabatic - type fluid acceleration .",
    "we think that two mechanisms work in the shadow region .",
    "first , the system adjusts the balance condition of the petschek shock , based on the upstream conditions . in the left quiet region ( @xmath89 ) , plasmas from the downstream side of the vertical shock come in to the petschek shock .",
    "the outflow speed is well approximated by the upstream alfvn velocity there . in the shadow region ( @xmath90 ) , plasmas from the upstream side of the vertical shock come in to the petschek shock .",
    "the upstream alfvn speeds are faster there , @xmath91 , mainly due to the lower density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rh]b ) .",
    "then , the lorentz force at the petschek shock accelerates plasmas to the `` new '' outflow speed of @xmath92 .",
    "one can see a rarefaction - like transition between the left petschek flow and the right new petschek flow in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcut ] .",
    "second , an adiabatic - type acceleration further boosts the jet.@xcite this is a simple hydrodynamic effect .",
    "since the outflow speed exceeds the local sound speed of @xmath93-@xmath94 , such a supersonic flow is adiabatically accelerated when its cross section increases like a nozzle .",
    "it particularly works near the fast shock , where the plasmoid opens up the outflow channel,@xcite and so the final outflow speed of @xmath95 exceeds the maximum upstream alfvn speed of @xmath91 .    according to the rankine ",
    "hugoniot analysis ( no . 2 in table [ table ] )",
    ", the petschek shock in the postplasmoid region is stronger than the left - side ( no . 1 ) .",
    "the shocked plasmas are hotter and the entropy is higher than plasmas which come from the left petschek shock , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]b .",
    "a sharp boundary separates plasmas from the left and right petschek shocks .",
    "we think this boundary is a contact discontinuity , which originates from the shock - shock interaction point .",
    "similarly , we expect that the field - aligned mixing will blur the discontinuity in the real world .",
    "the plasmoid is surrounded by a relatively sharp boundary .",
    "the rankine  hugoniot analysis across this outer shell ( nos . 5 and 6 in table [ table ] ) tells us that it is a slow shock @xcite .",
    "judging from the heating ratio of @xmath80 , the shock is stronger in the back side of the plasmoid than that in the front side , as discussed in previous literature@xcite .",
    "in addition to the reconnection jet , the slow shock on the outer shell supplies hot plasmas into the plasmoid .    outside the plasmoid , we find another pair of slow shocks around @xmath96 .",
    "the rankine ",
    "hugoniot result is presented in no . 7 in table [ table ] .",
    "this shock is rather weaker than the other shocks .",
    "in fact , one can hardly find a jump in the measure @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]b , because dissipation is quite limited .",
    "however , our code does capture a clear jump structure in the velocity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vx]b ) .",
    "interestingly , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : vx]a and the movie available online , the shock is originally located near the front edge .",
    "it gradually shifts backward to a stable location as the system evolves .",
    "the reconnection jet hits the plasmoid at the fast shock ( sec .",
    "[ sec : acc ] ) , where plasmas enter the plasmoid . in the downstream side , there is a busy transition region at @xmath97 , where the shocked flow further slows down and accumulate the magnetic fields @xmath98 ( fig . [ fig:1dcut ] ) .",
    "this region corresponds to the loop - top front@xcite .",
    "plasmas hit the loop - top front and then they diverge from the central region to the upper and lower regions inside the plasmoid .",
    "the reconnected fields are piled up between the loop - top front and the sharp tangential discontinuity ( td ) at @xmath99 .",
    "the field @xmath98 is remarkably strong in the left side of the td .",
    "the td separates upstream - origin plasmas and plasmas initially located inside the harris current sheet .",
    "this is visible in the @xmath79-profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap]b .",
    "the entropy is high in upstream - origin plasmas , because they are shock - heated or joule - heated . on the other hand ,",
    "the right plasmas just come from the low - entropy harris sheet .",
    "figure [ fig : plasmoid]a presents the density profile inside the plasmoid . while the plasmoid is dynamically growing and expanding , the td travels in the @xmath30-direction at a nearly constant speed of @xmath100 . to understand the plasma motion better , the velocity profile in the moving frame of @xmath101",
    "is shown by arrows .",
    "plasmas at @xmath41 constantly travels in the @xmath102-direction from the right . after they hit the td , they turn to the @xmath103 direction , and then they are reflected to the @xmath30-direction around @xmath104 .",
    "the td works as a `` magnetic wall '' to reflect plasmas from the right side . in the original frame",
    ", this traveling wall hits the immobile harris - sheet plasmas ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "therefore , the reflected flows are twice faster than the wall motion in fig .",
    "[ fig : vx]b , @xmath106 .",
    "the fast reflected flow triggers velocity - shear - driven turbulence . in the online movie",
    ", one can see that a vortex rolls up where the flow turns its direction and that the reflected flow is deformed to a kink - type structure .",
    "we think this is due to the kelvin - helmholtz instability between the reflected jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "for example , typical parameters on the upper side of the reflected jet are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the velocity shear . from the linear theory,@xcite we find that the shear is strong enough to bend the magnetic field lines , @xmath111 , but is slower than the sonic upper limit , @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the shear layer would be unstable to the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "one can see that the reflected flow is violently flapping in fig .",
    "[ fig : vx]b and the online movie . the reflected flow and the resulting turbulence mix plasmas inside the plasmoid .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : plasmoid]a and the online movie , one can also see that the incoming flow repeatedly flaps in the right region of @xmath113 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is related to the shock - reflection structure which will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : front ] .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plasmoid]b is the @xmath27-profile in the front side of the plasmoid .",
    "the outer shells reach the leading edges of the plasmoid at @xmath114 . around the central region , there is immobile plasmas ( @xmath105 ) , because high - density harris - sheet plasmas are initially confined here .",
    "outside the center , plasmas fast travel in the + @xmath4 direction .",
    "these twin flows are essentially driven by the reconnection outflow or the reflection by the magnetic wall .",
    "the central plasmas and the twin flows are separated by transition regions .",
    "the magnetic fields and plasmas flows are rather parallel to the transition regions , but they gradually enters from the central harris sheet to the plasmoid flows .    as pointed out by @xcite , the transition region looks like an intermediate shock , across which the tangential magnetic fields change their polarities .",
    "unfortunately , our rankine  hugoniot analysis fails to tell whether or not this is an intermediate shock ( no . 8 in table [ table ] ) .",
    "this is probably due to the following three reasons .",
    "first , the assumption for the analysis may be invalid here . the rankine  hugoniot analysis deals with a time - stationary and one - dimensional structure",
    ". however , oblique shocks repeatedly hit the boundary regions as discussed later . a time - dependent flow and a weak curvature makes our analysis difficult .",
    "second , the slow and intermediate speeds are hard to separate when the field lines are quasiperpendicular to the normal direction .",
    "third , our numerical scheme ( hll scheme ) is not ideal for the structure here .",
    "the hll code excellently captures the fast shocks but handles other discontinuities in an _ upwind _ manner . when the characteristic speeds are slower than the fast - mode speeds by order of magnitude , the code smoothes the structure . here",
    ", the fast speeds are typically @xmath115-@xmath116 , while intermediate and slow speeds are on an order of @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "these three reasons make it difficult to discuss the slow / intermediate mach numbers . in table",
    "[ table ] , we add asterisk signs to such unreliable mach numbers .",
    "the third issue will be improved by a better scheme which fully considers intermediate discontinuities @xcite . in the right side near the flow edges ( no . 9 in table [ table ] ) , the boundaries look like slow shocks@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we fail to classify this shock for the same reasons .",
    "we expect that the intermediate shock changes to the slow shock through the switch - off shock @xcite .    in the central channel",
    ", one can see that the oblique shocks propagate from the twin flow edges ( fig .",
    "[ fig : plasmoid]b ) .",
    "they are fast shocks ( no . 10 in table [ table ] ) .",
    "this is because the edges travel faster than the fastest right - going wave inside the central channel .",
    "these oblique shocks are repeatedly reflected by the intermediate shock regions @xcite .",
    "such shock - reflection leads to a chain of the diamond - shaped patterns , as denoted by the `` diamond - chain '' structure in ref . .",
    "the second and third right ones look irregular in this case , but one can see that all other rectangles are excellently in order in fig . [",
    "fig : plasmoid]b .",
    "the repeated shock - reflection explains a violent fluctuation in sonic properties in the front region ( @xmath118 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:1dcut ] .    roughly speaking , the plasmoid edges travel at a sizable fraction of the reconnection jet speed @xmath119 , which is well approximated by the initial upstream alfvn speed , @xmath120 . on the other hand ,",
    "since magnetic fields are very weak inside the current sheet , the right - going fast - mode speed is approximated by the sound speed in the current sheet .",
    "therefore , a requirement for the oblique shock and the diamond - chain is @xmath121 where the subscript @xmath122 denotes the current sheet properties . needless to say , our initial configuration satisfies this : @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    in the fronst side , there are small bow - shock - like structures around @xmath125 , @xmath126@xmath127 , extending outward from the plasmoid edges .",

    "figure [ fig : beta]a represents a snapshot with a lower upstream beta , @xmath128 .",

    "interestingly , a finger - like structure can be seen on the slow shock surface , around @xmath136 outside the plasmoid - front .",
    "it slowly grows there and it may eventually destroy and blur the forward slow shocks . we think that this is a signature of the corrugation instability of the slow shock surface @xcite",
    ". however , detail analysis of the instability is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this paper we visited many structures in and around the plasmoid .",
    "they are schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : illust ] .",
    "this extends an informative result in an earlier work ( i.e. , fig . 10 in ref .  ) . among these structures , the postplasmoid vertical shocks ( sec .",
    "[ sec : shock ] ) and the shock - reflected diamond - chain structure in the front side ( sec .",
    "[ sec : front ] ) were recently found in the relativistic regime.@xcite we confirmed them in the nonrelativistic regime as well  they are ubiquitous , regardless of the relativistic effects . a reverse flow or a backward flow around the plasmoid",
    "is often found in recent large - scale simulations@xcite , however , we clearly demonstrated that a slow shock stands at the front of the reverse flow .",
    "we also introduced another vertical slow shock outside the plasmoid .",
    "those two vertical shocks are similarly found in other runs in our parameter survey .",
    "we think that the vertical slow shocks are logical consequences of the low - beta condition of @xmath137 . from the following relation , @xmath138 we see @xmath139 when @xmath137 . as already discussed , the plasmoid - front propagates at a sizable fraction of the reconnection jet speed @xmath140 .",
    "when @xmath137 , the plasmoid supersonically travels in the system . at some location ,",
    "the expanding plasmoid structure interacts with the surrounding plasmas at a supersonic speed , and then a shock stands there .",
    "another interpretation is as follows . in a self - similarly expanding coordinate of the plasmoid",
    "system,@xcite the surrounding plasmas supersonically flow in the @xmath102-direction near the plasmoid - front , while the relative flow is very small near the reconnection point .",
    "a shock stands at the point where the supersonic flow slows down to subsonic speed . in summary ,",
    "when @xmath137 , the plasmoid system will inevitably involve vertical slow shocks .",
    "in addition , the compression effects by the plasmoid introduces another pair of vertical shocks outside the plasmoid . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : shock ] , the compression invokes the field - aligned flows in the @xmath141 directions .",
    "in addition , the adiabatic heating or cooling weakly modify the local sound speed , @xmath142 . in the main run ,",
    "the relative velocity between the plasmoid system and the upstream plasmas are initially supersonic in the right side .",
    "it temporally becomes subsonic at the forward vertical shock @xmath143 ( sec . [ sec : outer ] ) due to the compression effects .",
    "however , due to the field - aligned acceleration in the @xmath102-direction , the flow becomes supersonic again , and then it becomes subsonic at the postplasmoid vertical shock at @xmath71 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : shock ] ) .",
    "the positions of the vertical shocks depend on the @xmath16 parameter , because it controls the ratio of the sound speed to the alfvnic plasmoid motion . when @xmath16 is lower than the main run ( @xmath128 ) , the expanding speed of the entire structure easily exceeds the sound speed",
    ". therefore , the postplasmoid vertical shock is closer to the reconnection point , as demonstrated in sec . [",
    "sec : beta ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beta]a ) .",
    "the forward vertical slow shock can be small , when the plasmoid compression effects are not strong enough to change the supersonic condition .",
    "probably the forward vertical shock disappears in the extreme limit of @xmath144 . on the other hand , when @xmath16 is higher ( @xmath145 ) , the vertical slow shocks are nearer to the front - side of the plasmoid : the postplasmoid and forward ones are located just behind and in front of the plasmoid , respectively . as @xmath16 increases ,",
    "the postplasmoid slow shock moves frontward even in the backward side of the plasmoid outer shell , and then it will eventually disappear",
    ". the forward slow shock will disappear when the alvn speed is no longer supersonic , @xmath146 . depending on @xmath147",
    ", we expect one or two pairs of vertical slow shocks around the plasmoid .",
    "our discoveries can readily be applied to various numerical results in low - beta plasmas .",
    "@xcite @xcite carried out large - scale mhd simulation of a plasmoid in a similar configuration . while they did not mention it in the text",
    ", one can see a shock - like structure outside the plasmoid in run 2 with @xmath148 ( the top panel in fig . 9 in ref . ) .",
    "we think that this is a forward vertical slow shock .",
    "@xcite recognized a small shock outside the plasmoid ( indicated by an arrow in fig . 2c in ref . ) in the relativistic regime with @xmath128 .",
    "inspired by this work , we carry out further analysis and confirm that it was a forward vertical slow shock . in multiple plasmoid systems , @xcite found `` bow shocks '' during the nonsteady reconnection under an anomalous - type resistivity with @xmath18 ( fig .",
    "1d in ref . ) .",
    "judging from displacements , their plasmoid velocities are sub - alfvnic , on an order of @xmath149 .",
    "in such a developing stage , the forward vertical shock is located near the front , and so it would be a forward slow shock . finally , a recent work by @xcite reported a steepening structure of slow - mode wave behind the primary plasmoid ( fig .",
    "15a in ref .  ) .",
    "it would be related to a postplasmoid slow shock , as we found it in our relevant run with @xmath150 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : beta ] ; fig .",
    "[ fig : beta]b ) .    the shock - reflection or",
    "the diamond - chain structure is also a characteristic in the low - beta condition .",
    "dropping a factor of order unity , the requirement ( eq . [ eq : diamond ] ) reads @xmath151 although we still have a free parameter @xmath152 , the condition can be easily satisfied in the low-@xmath16 regimes .",
    "let us discuss some limitations of our simulation model .",
    "first , we assumed that the evolution in the bottom quadrant ( @xmath29 ) is symmetric to that in the upper quadrant ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "we do not think the quadrant assumption affects the main shock structures , because ref .",
    "was carried out without the assumption . on the other hand , we found the kelvin - helmholtz - like turbulence in the internal region ( sec .",
    "[ sec : internal ] ) .",
    "since this class of instabilities may prefer odd - parity perturbation across the neural line ( @xmath52 ) , the central harris sheet may flap in very late stages .",
    "this is left for future investigation .",
    "second , in the three dimensions , it is known that quasiperpendicular slow shocks are unstable to the corrugation instability.@xcite we do see a potential signature of the instability even in the two dimensions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : beta ] ) . in the real world , the vertical slow shocks may be violently folded and then we will see turbulent transition layers instead . regarding the shock - reflected diamond - chain structure , the oblique fast shocks will be stable@xcite , but it is not clear how stable the intermediate shocks are .",
    "it is interesting to see how those structures are modulated in the three dimensions in future .",
    "we carried out hrsc mhd simulations to study the fine structures of a plasmoid .",
    "we introduced new shock structures : ( 1 ) postplasmoid vertical slow shocks , ( 2 ) forward vertical slow shocks , and ( 3 ) shock - reflection structures , some of which were recently reported in ref . .",
    "we further found new features such as ( 4 ) the flapping motion of the reflected jet and ( 5 ) the finger - like instability of the slow shock surface .",
    "we interpreted that the vertical slow shocks and the shock - reflection are consequences of the alfvnic plasmoid motion , which is supersonic in low - beta plasmas .",
    "we argue that these shocks are rigorous features of a reconnection system in low - beta plasmas .",
