    "the resulting configuration is dominated by the higgs field . since any additional variational degree of freedom",
    "can only lower the total energy , the embedding of this configuration in the full standard model , with the @xmath133 gauge field included , will also yield a bound object as long as mixing between this heavy and the standard model fermions can be ignored .",
    "we see binding set in at @xmath134 , which is still within the range of energy scales at which the standard model is expected to provide an effective description of the relevant physics , and also within the range to be probed at the lhc .",
    "light fermions would contribute only weakly to the binding of the string , since their yukawa couplings are small . as a result",
    ", we can add them to our model , _",
    "e.g. _ to accommodate anomaly cancellation , without significantly changing the result .",
    "one of us ( hw ) is grateful to the organizers for putting together this enjoyable conference and providing the opportunity to present this project .",
