    "it is well known that spatially coupled ldpc codes exhibit a threshold saturation phenomenon : the threshold of an iterative belief propagation ( bp ) decoder , obtained by density evolution ( de ) , is improved to that of the optimal maximum - a - posteriori ( map ) decoder @xcite . as a consequence , it is possible to achieve capacity with simple regular ldpc codes , which show without spatial coupling a significant gap between the bp and the map threshold .",
    "the concept of spatial coupling is not limited to ldpc codes .",
    "recently it has been shown that spatial coupling has a similar effect on the thresholds of turbo - like codes , i.e. , concatenated convolutional codes that can be described by sparse graphical models .",
    "some block - wise spatially coupled ensembles of parallel concatenated codes ( sc - pccs ) and serially concatenated codes ( sc - sccs ) were introduced in @xcite . for the binary erasure channel ( bec )",
    "it is possible to derive exact de equations for these ensembles from the transfer functions of the component decoders @xcite and perform a threshold analysis , analogously to @xcite .",
    "the numerical results in @xcite suggest that threshold saturation occurs if the coupling memory is chosen sufficiently large .",
    "a similar threshold analysis has been performed in @xcite for braided convolutional codes ( bccs ) @xcite , another class of turbo - like codes which have an inherent spatially coupled structure .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give an overview of spatially coupled turbo - like codes and compare the thresholds of sc - pccs , sc - sccs and bccs .",
    "we first present the ensembles considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "then we generalize the original bcc ensemble ( type - i bcc ) to larger coupling memories and demonstrate that threshold saturation occurs .",
    "furthermore , inspired by the sc - pcc construction in @xcite , we introduce and analyze a new bcc ensemble ( type - ii bcc ) in which not only the parity symbols but also the information symbols are coupled over several time instants .",
    "the thresholds are further improved by this construction , i.e. , the gap to the map threshold is smaller for a given coupling memory and vanishes as the memory is increased .",
    "in this section , we describe how the concept of spatial coupling can be applied to turbo - like codes .",
