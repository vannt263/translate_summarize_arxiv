    "the solar atmosphere is host to a variety of highly energetic events such as coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , flares , prominences , and coronal heating .",
    "the huge reservoir of energy in the solar atmosphere is related to the magnetic field originating in the convection zone , where shearing motion of field line foot points can stretch and twist the anchored field @xcite . a variety of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves are generated in the corona due to convective motion in the photosphere .",
    "the convective shearing motion not only produces , fast or , slow magnetoacoustic waves , but also brings topologically disparate parts of the magnetic configuration closer together resulting in the formation of current sheets .",
    "all in all , a tiny fraction of convective energy carried by the waves to higher altitude may suffice to heat the coronal plasma to high temperatures .",
    "this simple physical picture of wave excitation , propagation and the ensuing coronal heating is attractive as it ties the heat transport in the solar corona and heliosphere to the ultimate source of energy  shearing photospheric convective motions .",
    "therefore the investigation of wave propagation and concomitant heating of coronal plasma in the framework of mhd has been a popular topic in solar physics @xcite .",
    "most solar atmospheric heating , with the possible exception of flares , takes place in the chromosphere .",
    "the chromosphere extends up to about nine pressure scale heights , i.e. about @xmath1 mm above the photospheric surface .",
    "the lower chromosphere is threaded by strong ( @xmath2 kilogauss ) vertical flux tubes located in the network regions where they are observed as bright points .",
    "these tubes , which have a low filling factor ( @xmath3 ) near the foot point in the photosphere , expand with increasing height to fill about @xmath4 of the lower chromosphere ( altitude @xmath5 , where caii emission features are observed in h and k lines ) before filling the entire atmosphere and forming a canopy in the chromosphere .",
    "the quiet solar internetwork region is also magnetised , with patches of concentrated kg magnetic field @xcite and an order of magnitude smaller field everywhere else .",
    "observation suggests that localised active regions that emit @xmath6 of the coronal radiative loss near solar maximum contain plasma of chromospheric origin @xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that the same mechanism that transports mechanical energy from the convection zone to the chromosphere to sustain its heating rate also supplies the energy needed to heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind .    however , the number of plasma particles in the partially ionised solar atmosphere , particularly below @xmath7 is small @xcite . as a result",
    "the plasma particles are not _ frozen _ in the field owing to frequent collision with the neutral hydrogen @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ideal mhd description which is valid only for the fully ionised fluid is unsuitable to describe the low temperature photosphere - chromosphere where non  ideal mhd effects such as hall , ambipolar and ohm diffusion dominate @xcite .",
    "all in all , there is no unified ideal mhd like framework to describe the weakly ionised and weakly magnetised photosphere and fully ionised and highly magnetised corona with weakly ionised and highly magnetised chromosphere sandwiched in - between .",
    "the inclusion of neutral dynamics not only destroys the economy and simplicity of the single fluid mhd description of fully ionised plasma but the very concept of a flux tube may be difficult to define in the multi  fluid framework .",
    "furthermore , high frequency waves may not survive the collision - dominated photosphere and chromosphere @xcite .",
    "this could have been anticipated on the grounds that in the photosphere ( @xmath8 ) and chromosphere ( @xmath9 ) the plasma number density is much smaller than the neutral number density and thus , high frequency ( with respect to the ion - neutral collision frequency ) mhd waves are severely damped by collisional dissipation of the wave energy .",
    "a way out of this difficulty is to retain the mhd momentum equation for the ionized component and include the effect of collisions with the neutrals by modifying the induction and energy equations to incorporate a conductivity tensor @xcite , an approach often employed to study the lower ionosphere of the earth .",
    "however , the derivation of the _ time  independent _ conductivity tensor neglects time derivatives in the electron and ion momentum equations , i.e. @xmath10 , requiring that the dynamical response frequencies of the ions and electrons , @xmath11 , are much smaller than their respective gyro - frequencies , @xmath12 .",
    "further , the relative ion ",
    "neutral drift is assumed much smaller than the centre of mass ion ",
    "neutral velocity @xcite . therefore ,",
    "neglecting plasma inertia , a linear relationship between the electric field @xmath13 and plasma current @xmath14 can be easily derived @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the _ time - independent _ conductivity tensor .",
    "however , the mhd equation of motion assumes @xmath17 .",
    "in fact the ion carries the inertia of the fluid .",
    "therefore , on the one hand , the _ time  independent _ conductivity tensor implies @xmath18 , on the other hand , the mhd momentum equation requires @xmath17 . clearly ,",
    "investigation of the collisional effects by merely modifying the induction and energy equation in the mhd framework is highly unsatisfactory .",
    "any realistic model of the solar atmosphere must reflect two basic observational facts : ( a ) the magnetic field distribution on the solar surface is not continuous but is organised into network and internetwork elements . whereas the network field ( @xmath19 ) is predominantly vertical and organised into flux tubes ( diameter @xmath20 ) located in the intergranular lanes ,",
    "the internetwork field @xmath21 in the interior of supergranule cells is primarily horizontal @xcite ; ( b ) the plasma in the photosphere  chromosphere is weakly ionised ( with fractional ionisation , i.e.  the ratio of the electron and neutral number densities , @xmath22 , val81 ) .",
    "both the active and quiet phases of the solar atmosphere are highly dynamic and consist of convectively driven vortices and flows on a variety of spatial and temporal scales @xcite .",
    "most vortices are small ( @xmath23 ) with average size @xmath24 and typical lifetime @xmath25 , although large vortices @xmath26 with lifetime @xmath27 have also been observed @xcite .",
    "the bright points associated with the vortex motion in the intergranular lane moves with typical speed @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields appear to play a crucial role in mediating vortex motion in the photosphere and chromosphere @xcite .",
    "rotation has been invoked in the past to explain the stability of flux tubes @xcite .",
    "models of spicules also invoke rotating flux tubes @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations of solar convection display turbulent vortex flows at intergranular lanes @xcite .",
    "vorticity generation near the boundaries of granules has also been seen in numerical simulation of the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the formation of small - scale , intergranular vortices suggests that vorticity is formed due to the interaction of photospheric plasma with the ambient magnetic field in intergranular lanes @xcite .",
    "high - resolution simulations including the effects of non - ideal mhd show that the hall effect generates out - of - plane velocity fields with maximum speed @xmath29 at the interface layers between weakly magnetized light bridges and neighbouring strong field umbral regions @xcite .",
    "to summarise , both observation and numerical simulation points to the presence of shear flow at various spatial scales in the solar photosphere .    large scale shear flow acts as a source of free energy in the solar plasma that can easily destabilise waves .",
    "for example , shear driven kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) , which converts shear flow energy into vortex kinetic energy , is invoked to explain the dynamical structures in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "the khi possibly acts as a triggering mechanism for large scale solar transient phenomena such as solar flares , cmes , and associated eruptions @xcite .",
    "the generation of the highly dynamical structures observed by the solar dynamical observatory ( sdo ) is most likely due to the khi @xcite .",
    "although the solar atmosphere may be susceptible to khi , the presence of a magnetic field is not conducive to this instability .",
    "for example , a magnetic field directed along the flow suppresses khi whereas a transverse field has no effect on the instability @xcite .",
    "however , magnetic fields not only quench shear instabilities but can also facilitate them .",
    "for example , the most important instability in accretion discs , the magnetorotational instability is caused by an interplay between the angular velocity of the magnetised fluid and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "thus , depending on the presence of a velocity gradient , magnetic field , when well coupled to the plasma can suppress as well as drive the instability .",
    "therefore , before dwelling upon the role of the magnetic field on the flow driven instabilities , it is pertinent to know how well is the magnetic field coupled to the surrounding matter .    magnetic field drift through weakly ionised matter in the presence of shear flow can assist waves to grow .",
    "for example , in protoplanetary discs , both hall and ambipolar diffusion enhance the magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "clearly , the drift of the magnetic field in a weakly - ionised diffusive medium provides new pathways through which shear energy can be channelled to the waves .",
    "indeed , diffusive destabilisation of a partially ionised medium in the presence of shear flow is not unique to weakly - ionised discs but is generic @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredients required to excite this diffusion  shear instability are the presence of a shear flow , and favourable magnetic field topology .",
    "the ensuing instability is overtly similar to khi , and not surprisingly , the growth rate is proportional to the shear gradient . however , unlike khi which is hydrodynamic in nature , this is a magnetohydrodynamic instability .",
    "a detailed investigation of diffusive shear instability in the context of the solar atmosphere is carried out here , building on our previous work ( @xcite , hereafter pw12a ) , as follows .",
    "first , unlike pw12a , where only a vertical field and transverse fluctuation ( vertical wave vector ) is assumed , here field topology is more general and the wave vector may be oblique .",
    "second , in pw12a the back reaction of the fluid on the magnetic field was completely ignored , whereas here it is retained and as a result the shear driven diffusive instability does not have a cut - off wavelength .",
    "third , for vertical fields and transverse fluctuations we showed in pw12a that only hall diffusion assists the instability , with ambipolar and ohm diffusion ( which combine as pedersen diffusion ) only able to damp waves . in the present work for a more general field topology and oblique wave vector , we shall see that both ambipolar and hall diffusion can assist the instability .",
    "finally , the general stability criterion for a magnetic - diffusion - dominated plasma in the presence of shear flows is presented in this work .",
    "the paper is organised in the following fashion .",
    "the basic set of equations and dispersion relation are given in sec .  2 ; in subsection 2.1 we give the linearised equations in terms of the diffusion tensor and derive the general dispersion relation . in sec .",
    "3 the general stability criterion is described and the maximum growth rate of the instability is derived .",
    "the expressions for the maximum growth rate and critical wavelength are given in limiting cases . in sec .",
    "4 , various limiting cases of the dispersion relation are discussed . in sec .",
    "5 applications of the results are outlined . finally , in sec .",
    "6 we give a brief summary of the main results .",
    "the photosphere  chromosphere plasma consists primarily of electrons , protons , singly ionized metallic ions ,",
    "h , he i , he ii , and he iii . we shall ignore the distinction between hydrogen and helium and assume that the photosphere and chromosphere are comprised of electrons , singly charged ions and neutral hydrogen .",
    "although the fundamental set of equations describing a partially ionised plasma was formulated more than 50 years ago @xcite , we shall adopt the convenient single - fluid formulation given by @xcite obtained by clearly elucidating the relevant spatial and temporal scales of partially ionised plasmas .    in the low frequency limit",
    ", the collisional dynamics and fractional ionisation can be incorporated in the basic set of equations without having to deal with the complexity of three  fluid equations .",

    "( [ eq : ind1 ] ) , is particularly convenient for the linearization which we will conduct shortly .",
    "we note from eq .",
    "( [ eq : diffu ] ) that the magnitude of ohm diffusion is independent of magnetic field strength , whereas hall diffusion has a linear dependence on the field , i.e. @xmath56 , and the dependence of ambipolar diffusion on the magnetic field is quadratic , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "thus , as the magnetic field strength in a flux tube decreases with increasing altitude , the drop in the hall diffusivity will not be as severe as for ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the altitude dependence of the diffusivities is easily quantified once the variation of the magnetic field with altitude is specified ; for this purpose we adopt a power - law variation of the magnetic field strength with neutral number density @xmath58 , i.e. b = b_0()^0.3 , [ eq : scl ] where @xmath59 is the number density of neutrals at the surface of the photosphere ( i.e.  @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 is the typical value of the field at intergranular boundaries .",
    "such a field profile captures the height dependence of the observed field in flux tubes @xcite .",
    "we note that the above scaling of the magnetic field differs somewhat from the mass density scaling @xcite although we have retained the same power law index @xmath62 .    the neutral number density and fractional ionisation ( model c , val81 ) , the ratio of the neutral and bulk densities @xmath63 , and various collision frequencies are given in table  1 .",

    "we utilise the above magnetic field profile , along with the collision frequencies given in table  1 , to compute the diffusivities ; these are given in table 2 . in fig  [ fig : df ] we plot the diffusivities against height , demonstrating that hall diffusion dominates ohm and ambipolar diffusion in the photosphere and lower chromosphere in the intense field regions ( fig  [ fig : df]a ) . however , in the weak field regions ( @xmath66 at @xmath67 ) ohm and hall are comparable below @xmath68 , but hall diffusion still dominates the entire photosphere - chromosphere ( fig  [ fig : df]b ) .",
    "it has been suggested in the past that pedersen diffusion ( which is the sum of ohmic and ambipolar diffusions ) could play an important role in chromospheric heating @xcite .",
    "we find that in sunspots , active regions , pores and intergranular regions where the field is intense , hall and ambipolar will dominate ohm diffusion .",
    "clearly , realistic modelling of energetic processes such as chromospheric heating , cmes etc . must include these diffusive processes . while hall diffusion is non  dissipative in nature ,",
    "it does have a role in extracting energy from the convective motion of the largely neutral medium . as we have shown recently @xcite , hall diffusion in the presence of shear flow destabilises low frequency fluctuations which may lead to the turbulent cascade of convective energy to smaller scales where dissipation can convert it to heat .",
    "therefore , it is quite plausible that the hall effect may play an important role in heating the chromospheric plasma .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : dift ]    how much diffusion is too much in the solar atmosphere ?",
    "for example , if magnetic diffusion dominates fluid convection in the induction equation  ( [ eq : ind ] ) , the magnetic field will be poorly coupled to the plasma @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall compare the advection term @xmath69 with the diffusion terms in the induction eq .",
    "( [ eq : ind ] ) by defining magnetic reynolds numbers = , = , = . note that both am and hm depend on how well the plasma is coupled to the magnetic field since both ambipolar and hall diffusion depend on the magnetic field and @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "thus = / ( _ i_e ) , = / _ e. the dependence of am and hm on the plasma hall parameters @xmath52 is not surprising given that both ambipolar and hall diffusion arise from the magnetisation of the medium .",
    "this also explains the inherently different nature of ohm and ambipolar diffusion : whereas ohm diffusion acts isotropically , ambipolar diffusion owing to its dependence on the magnetic field is anisotropic .",
    "as we shall see , in the presence of shear flow , the anisotropic nature of ambipolar diffusion is at the centre of wave destabilization .",
    "the height dependence of rm , hm and am for both kg and 0.1 kg fields were discussed in pw12a .",
    "it was shown that when @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 is the speed ) , @xmath74 suggesting that the ohm diffusion is unimportant in comparison with the advection term .",
    "in contrast , hm and am are three to four orders of magnitude smaller than rm .",
    "the recent 2d numerical simulation of the partially ionized solar atmosphere also suggests that in the weak field regions ( @xmath75 g ) in the chromosphere , hall diffusion is two orders of magnitude larger than ohm diffusion whereas ambipolar diffusion is four to six order of magnitude larger than ohm diffusion @xcite . clearly , the ambipolar and hall diffusion terms are of critical importance in the induction equation .",
    "magnetic elements in the photosphere - chromosphere are highly dynamic , being accompanied by numerous flows with different spatial and temporal scales .",
    "recent numerical simulations of umbral magnetoconvection @xcite suggest that the dynamical scale over which hall diffusion can generate magnetic and velocity fields are much smaller and faster than the spatial and temporal scale of a typical flux tube ( @xmath2 1020 km and @xmath76 cf .",
    "@xmath77 few hundred km and @xmath2 few days , respectively ) .",
    "the simulation results are easily scalable to @xmath78 with temporal scale @xmath79 .",
    "we note that at present the best achievable resolution is @xmath80 @xcite .    as the spatial scale over which the flow and field generation occurs is much smaller than the typical diameter of a flux tube , we shall approximate part of the cylindrical tube by a planar sheet and work in cartesian coordinates where @xmath81 correspond to the local radial , azimuthal and vertical directions .",
    "we assume an initial homogeneous state with azimuthal shear flow @xmath82 .",

    "<S> macroscopic gas motions are widespread throughout the solar atmosphere and shearing motions couple to the non  ideal effects , destabilising low frequency fluctuations in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic instability lies in the collisional coupling of the neutral particles to the magnetized plasma in the presence of a sheared background flow . </S>",

    "<S> when the magnetic field and wave vector are both vertical , ambipolar and ohm diffusion can be combined as pedersen diffusion and cause only damping ; in this case only hall drift in tandem with shear flow drives the instability . </S>",
    "<S> however , for non - vertical fields and oblique wave vectors , both ambipolar diffusion and hall drift are destabilizing .    </S>",
