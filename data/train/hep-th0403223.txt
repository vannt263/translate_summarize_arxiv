    "in the last few years significant progress has been made in constructing string theoretic cosmological models where inflation is driven by the naturally occuring potentials between d - branes and their antibranes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the formation of lower - dimensional branes at the end of inflation can lead to interesting signals : cosmic - string - like or higher dimensional defects could be observable remnants @xcite , possibly providing a rare clue to the stringy origin of inflation . a more radical idea was explored in @xcite : perhaps our own observable universe is such a defect in the higher - dimensional spacetime predicted by string theory . since the stable branes in type iib string theory have spatial dimensionalities which are odd , a 3-brane would have descended from annihilation of 5-branes in this picture , and thus they would be codimension - two defects in of the effective 6d theory .",
    "codimension - two braneworlds have attracted interest lately because of their novel features , which might have some bearing on the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "our interest in this scenario is motivated by questions about the efficiency of reheating in brane - antibrane inflation @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the energy density liberated from the brane collisions will be converted mostly into closed string states , ultimately gravitons , and not necessarily into visible radiation @xcite .",
    "a generic mechanism which could avoid this problem was proposed in @xcite , wherein the reheating in d - brane driven inflation is due to the coupling of massless gauge fields to a time - dependent tachyon condensate , which describes the annihilation process .",
    "however , ref.@xcite considered only the formation of a tachyon kink instead of the more realistic case of a vortex , and it used a somewhat crude ansatz for the background tachyon field .",
    "the problem of finding the actual tachyon background predicted by string theory was studied numerically in @xcite but no attempt was made to improve on the reheating computation . in this paper",
    "we aim to analytically determine the dynamics of formation of lower dimensional branes described as tachyon defects  both kinks and vortices  and to improve on the reheating calculation of @xcite .",
    "let us begin by describing the scenario we have in mind .",
    "in the simplest version of d - brane inflation a parallel brane and antibrane begin with some separation between them in one of the extra dimensions .",
    "although parallel branes are supersymmetric and have no force between them , the brane - antibrane system breaks supersymmetry so that there is an attractive force and hence a nonvanishing potential energy .",
    "it is the latter which drives inflation .",
    "once the branes have reached a critical separation one of the stretched string modes between the branes , @xmath2 , becomes tachyonic and the branes become unstable to annihilation .",
    "the tachyon field starts from the unstable maximum @xmath3 and rolls towards the vacuum @xmath4 .",
    "however , topological defects may form through the kibble mechanism @xcite so that @xmath3 stays fixed at the core of the defect .",
    "these defects are known to be consistent descriptions of branes whose dimension is lower than that of the original branes @xcite .",
    "for example , the brane - antibrane system has a complex tachyon field , leading to vortices which represent codimension - two branes . on the other hand",
    ", an unstable brane has a real tachyon which leads to kinks representing codimension - one branes .",
    "the formation of tachyon defects at the endpoint of d - brane inflation is a dynamical process where the tachyon couples to gauge fields which will be localised on the descendant brane .",
    "it is thus expected that some radiation will be produced by the rolling of the tachyon and the problem of reheating becomes quantitative : can this effect be efficient enough to strongly deplete the energy density of the tachyon fluid so the the universe starts out being dominated by radiation rather than cold dark matter ?",
    "it is important to stress that though the situation is somewhat analogous to that of hybrid inflation ( where the tachyon plays the role of the unstable direction in field space which allows for inflation to end quickly ) the mechanism for reheating is qualitatively different .",
    "the difference is that in the low energy effective field theory which describes the tachyon @xmath2 , the potential is minimized at @xmath5 and there are no oscillations about the minimum of the potential . in a normal hybrid inflation model , @xmath2 would have a minimum at some finite value and the oscillations of @xmath2 around its minimum would give rise to reheating in the usual way . in the present case ,",
    "the time dependence of the background is monotonic , not oscillatory .",
    "reheating thus might seem to resemble gravitational particle production @xcite rather than the standard picture in which the inflaton decays .",
    "however , in this work we highlight an important difference between reheating through tachyon condensation and gravitational particle production , which can make the former much more efficient : there is a divergence in the stress - energy tensor of the tachyon field within a finite time , which corresponds to the formation of the lower - dimension d - brane .    in this paper",
    "we study analytically the dynamical formation of the tachyon vortex and improve the reheating calculation , using a slightly simplified model of particle production by tachyon condensation , which captures the essential physics revealed by the analysis of vortex formation . in section",
    "ii we review the formation of tachyon kinks which describes the condensation of a brane to a brane of codimension - one . in sections iii",
    "- v we study analytically the formation of a tachyon vortex on the brane - antibrane pair .",
    "section iii introduces sen s action for the complex tachyon field describing this situation .",
    "section iv presents new analytic results for the time - dependent , complex tachyon field representing vortex formation , both near to and far from the vortex core . in section",
    "v we show that the stress - energy tensor for the system splits into a localized , singular piece describing the descendant branes , plus a bulk contribution that describes the rolling tachyon condensate .",
    "section vi introduces the effective action for u(1 ) gauge bosons which become localized on the final - state 3-brane , in the rolling tachyon background .",
    "this provides a model for the visible radiation produced during reheating . in section vii",
    "we calculate the energy density of this produced radiation on the 3-brane , using some reasonable simplifying assumptions .",
    "section viii gives our conclusions , including speculation about how the final brane - antibrane system could be stabilized .",
    "in this section we review the dynamical formation of a d@xmath6-brane through tachyon condensation on an unstable d@xmath0-brane , and derive a few new results .",
    "the equations of motion in this case are simpler than in the case of the vortex and we will use the analysis of this section to reinforce our conclusions when we analyze the vortex since many of the results are quite analogous .",

    "since reheating on each final - state brane should be equally efficient , the 3d energy density available for reheating on one them , which we call the critical energy density @xmath420 , is half the difference between the initial and final tensions of the branes and antibranes : @xmath421 where we have used the recursion relation @xmath422 .",
    "the tension of a d3-brane is given by @xcite @xmath423 the string coupling @xmath424 , in 5 + 1 dimensions of which two are compact , is determined by the gauge coupling evaluated at the string scale , @xmath425 @xcite : @xmath426 thus we have [ rhoceq ] l_s^4 _ c = ( 1 - ) .",
    "in the regime where @xmath427 , which was where we could most easily quantify the particle production , the second term in parentheses can be neglected , and in any case it would be unimportant for a rough estimate unless it accidentally canceled the first term ( @xmath428 ) to high accuracy .",
    "hence we drop this term and take @xmath429 .",
    "the energy density @xmath420 is the critical value at which the conversion into radiation would be 100% efficient . in our analysis we take @xmath430 @xcite which gives @xmath431 .",
    "the critical energy density is shown as a dashed horizontal line in figures [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] .",
    "we see that the criterion for efficient reheating can be achieved for moderate values of the parameters .",
    "we only need for the length - scale cutoffs @xmath432 and @xmath314 to be somewhat smaller than the string scale , while the size of the extra dimensions should exceed a few times @xmath315 . using ( [ mainresult ] )",
    ", we can write the criterion for efficient reheating as ( 2(m_s))^1/4 l_s 0.7 l_s    we have not taken into account the back - reaction of the particle production on the tachyon background , which is why our calculation allows for more reheating than is energetically possible . the back reaction will suppress somewhat the actual efficiency of reheating , but we do nt expect a dramatic reduction . given that we have been conservative in our estimates , such as ignoring the contributions from produced kk photons which will decay into massless photons , our result makes it plausible that a large fraction of the original energy can be converted into visible radiation .",
    "we have argued for the possibility that our visible universe might be a codimension - two brane left over from annihilation of a d5-brane / antibrane pair at the end of inflation . in this picture , reheating is due to production of standard model particles ( _ e.g. _ photons ) on the final branes , driven by their couplings to the tachyon field which encodes the instability of the initial state as well as the vortex which represents the final brane .",
    "we find that reheating can be efficient , in the sense that a sizable fraction of the energy available from the unstable vacuum can be converted into visible radiation , and not just gravitons .",
    "the efficiency of reheating is greatest if the radius of compactification of the extra dimensions is larger than @xmath433-@xmath434 times the string length @xmath315 .",
    "the efficiency also depends on phenomenological parameters we had to introduce by hand in order to cut off ultraviolet divergences in the calculated particle production rate : namely @xmath314 , a nonvanishing radius for the final brane , and @xmath435 , an explicit cutoff on the momentum of the photons produced .",
    "the latter must be introduced to correct for discontinous time derivatives in our simplified model of the background tachyon condensate ; the actual behavior of the condensate corresponds to a cutoff of order @xmath436 .",
    "it is less obvious why the effective field theory treatment should give divergent results as the thickness of the final brane ( @xmath437 ) goes to zero , but it seems clear that a fully string - theoretic computation would give no such divergence , and therefore it is reasonable to cut off the field - theory divergence at @xmath411",
    ". given only these mild assumptions , our estimates ( [ mainresult],[rhoceq ] ) predict that the fraction of the available energy which is converted into visible radiation is @xmath438 .",
    "this simple estimate counts only photons ; in a more realistic calculation , it would be enhanced by the number of light degrees of freedom which couple to the tachyon , which could be much greater 1 .",
    "moreover it could also be enhanced by the production of massive kk modes , which correspond to string excitations when the vortex has formed @xcite .",
    "our analysis makes significant improvements to the previous work of @xcite .",
    "we considered the formation of a vortex in the tachyon field rather than a kink , in line with the descent relations for stable dp - branes .",
    "we found analytic solutions for the tachyon field which give the time dependence in the vicinity of the defect while it is forming , for both the vortex and the kink solutions . in the latter case we verified that this solution reproduces the known dynamics of kink formation which was determined numerically in @xcite , giving us more confidence in the vortex solutions , which are quite analogous .",
    "our explicit solution for the tachyon background is nevertheless too complicated for computing the production of particles on the defect .",
    "we therefore approximated it by a simpler ansatz with the same qualitative behavior , which allows for analytic solutions of the gauge fields in the background .",
    "this ansatz resembles a gauge field in a 6d spacetime with two compact spatial dimensions which are contracting with time , and leads to simple analytic results for the energy density of photons produced during the contraction , in the regime where the extra dimensions are large compared to the string scale .",
    "there are still some outstanding questions to be addressed concerning this scenario .",
    "first , we have made reference to the kibble mechanism for the creation of the final state defects .",
    "if we assume the causal bound of one defect per hubble volume then this would imply that the size of the extra dimensions must exceed the inverse hubble rate ; otherwise there would be enough time for the fields to straighten themselves out and the putative vortex - antivortex pair would immediately annihilate .",
    "for example if we take the string scale @xmath439 to be @xmath440 gev then @xmath441 and we would need the compactification scale to be of order @xmath442 .",
    "our results indicate that efficient reheating is compatible with a large compactification scale .",
    "however , taking the remaining four extra dimensions ( which the initial 5-brane / antibrane pair do not wrap ) to be string scale is not consistent with getting inflation since the initial state 5-brane and antibrane can not be sufficiently separated to satisfy the slow roll conditions .",
    "one the other hand , our results indicate that the reheating _ can _ be efficient for @xmath311 only a few times the string length , though in this scenario a naive application of the kibble mechanism does not favor having the final state defects span the three large dimensions .",
    "these requirements may not be prohibitive since the question of how these defects form dynamically at the end of inflation is a quantitative one which merits further investigation . in principle",
    "the correlation length for the initial fluctuations of the tachyon field could be as small as the string length .",
    "we point out also that it is possible that the dynamics of the formation of tachyon defects is qualitatively different from defect formation in a conventional scalar field theory .",
    "for example , the numerical investigation of @xcite , it was found that small kinks in the initial configuration which are in causal contact with each other _ do not _ dynamically straighten themselves out as they would in a conventional , nontachyonic field theory .",
    "instead , every place where the field crosses zero in the initial state develops a full - blown kink , so long as there was enough energy in the bulk to produce the required number of kinks . another indication that the dynamics of the tachyon field may be qualitatively different from an ordinary scalar field theory comes from the @xcite in which the causal structure of the tachyon dirac - born - infeld action was studied .",
    "the authors of @xcite found that small fluctuations of the tachyon field propagate according to an effective metric which depends on the tachyon background . in the case of a homogeneous rolling background",
    "it was found that as the condensation proceeds the effective metric contracts to the carroll limit of the lorentz group so that the tachyon light cone collapses into a timelike half line and the tachyon fields at different spatial points are decoupled .",
    "we feel that quantitatively determining the dynamics of the formation of tachyon defects at the endpoint of d - brane inflation is a question which deserves further investigation .    in the present analysis we have not included the gravitational or ramond - ramond forces between the vortex and antivortex which would attract them toward each other and lead to their eventual annihilation .",
    "how do we insure that the braneworld on which we are supposed to live is safe from annihilation with an antibrane in the bulk ?",
    "one possibility is to have warping caused by a stack of branes which wraps only the equator of the extra dimensions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lastfig ] .",
    "such a braneworld scenario using the ads soliton solution for the bulk has been considered in ref .",
    "the advantage for our scenario is that the warping can provide a barrier to the annihilation of the brane - antibrane pair , since it is energetically favorable for them to remain within their respective throats .      in solving for the tachyon background we have also ignored the possibility of caustic formation in the bulk @xcite by taking initial profiles without too much curvature .",
    "it is possible that caustic formation may be an artifact of the derivative truncation which leads to the born - infeld type of lagranian for the tachyon .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of the problems of dynamical equations with infinitely many derivatives .",
    "brane - antibrane inflation and braneworld cosmology are two of the most important applications of string theoretic ideas to cosmology .",
    "we find it intriguing that these two ideas might be combined in the way we have described .",
    "an outstanding challenge is to find some observable signatures that would be able to test our scenario , for example through the gravitational wave component which is expected to be a major component of the radiation produced during reheating .",
    "we thank horace stoica for helpful discussions concerning warped compactifications as well as robert brandenberger and henry tye for helpful comments regarding the kibble mechanism .",
