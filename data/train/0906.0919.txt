    "the presence of flat ring structures is a characteristic feature of the four giant planets of the solar system , in particular , the famous saturn s rings .",
    "planetary rings are the thinnest of all astrophysical discs , with a ratio of the thickness to the radius of order @xmath0 @xcite . on a larger scale , several ring galaxies , or r galaxies , objects in the form of approximate elliptical rings with no luminous matter visible in their interiors , are known ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . sometimes , as the result of interactions between galaxies , a ring of gas and stars is formed and rotates over the poles of a galaxy , originating the so called polar - ring galaxies ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the exact gravitational potential of a ring of zero thickness and constant linear density is given by an elliptic integral , which in practice is often approximated by a truncated multipolar expansion .",
    "the potential of a disc with negative mass density whose rim has positive mass density can be obtained by a process of complexification of the potential of a punctual mass @xcite .",
    "this potential was used by letelier and oliveira @xcite to construct superpositions of static bodies with axial symmetry in the context of general relativity .",
    "an exact solution representing the superposition of a disc with a central hole and a schwarzschild black hole was obtained by lemos and letelier @xcite .",
    "the properties of this space - time and of space - times that represent superpositions of a schwarzschild black - hole and a ring were investigated in @xcite .",
    "recently , letelier @xcite constructed several families of flat rings using the superposition of morgan and morgan @xcite discs of different densities .",
    "the main advantage of these models is that the density and the gravitational potential are given in terms of elementary functions .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to use the same method to construct other potential - density pairs representing flat ring structures by superposing members of the classical kuzmin - toomre family of discs . because the kuzmin - toomre discs have infinite extension , so do the resulting rings , while the letelier rings have a finite outer radius or a central hole .",
    "all the potential - density pairs can be explicitly stated in terms of elementary functions .",
    "we construct systems composed of one and two concentric flat rings and a central kuzmin - toomre disc surrounded by a flat ring . by using a suitable transformation ,",
    "some of these flat ring systems are used to generate three - dimensional potential - density pairs with toroidal mass distributions .",
    "similar toroidal analytical systems have been recently obtained by ciotti and giampieri @xcite , and ciotti and marinacci @xcite using a different technique , known as complex - shift method .",

    "we calculate the circular velocity of particles moving inside these structures and study the stability under radial perturbations of circular orbits on the plane of the rings .",
    "we also briefly discuss the influence of a point mass located at the centre of a ring on the rotation profile and on the stability of the ring . in section [ sec_thick ] , we `` inflate '' some flat ring models by using a transformation proposed by miyamoto and nagai @xcite .",
    "the resulting three - dimensional potential - density pairs have toroidal concentrations of matter . in section [ sec_discuss ] , we summarize and discuss the results . in appendices [ ap_a ] to [ ap_f ] , we collect , for reference , several equations expressing potential - density pairs , circular velocities and epicyclic frequencies for the structures discussed in the main text .",
