    "neutron stars ( ns ) are some of the densest manifestations of massive objects in the universe which provide very rich information for testing theories of dense matter physics and also provide a connection among nuclear physics , particle physics , statistical physics and astrophysics @xcite . the global aspects of neutron stars , such as the masses , radii and composition are determined by solving the so - called tolman - oppenheimer - volkov ( tov ) equations @xcite .",
    "however there are large variations in predicted radii and maximum masses because of the uncertainties in the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) near and mainly above the saturation density @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the total energy of neutron rich matter ( the case of a neutron star ) can be written as a sum of two parts .",
    "the first one is the contribution of the symmetric nuclear matter ( which is well known ) and the second is the symmetry energy ( se ) which still is uncertain although several constraints exist from ground state masses ( binding energies ) and giant dipole resonances of laboratory nuclei .",
    "a consequence of this uncertainty is that different models predict up to a factor of 6 , variations in the pressure of neutron star matter near @xmath0 , even though the pressure of symmetric matter is better known , being nearly zero at the same density .",
    "this pressure variation accounts for the nearly 50% variation in the predictions of neutron star radii @xcite",
    ".    in general , the value of the se at nuclear saturation density and mainly the density dependence of the se are both difficult to be determined in the laboratory .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to propose a new parameterization for the potential part of the symmetry energy @xmath1 in order to be able to reproduce the results of a variety of microscopic models both in low and high values of the baryon density .",
    "especially the trend of the symmetry energy just above the equilibrium density @xmath0 is a critical factor in determining the neutron star radius .    in order to calculate the global properties of neutron stars ( mass , radius ets . )",
    "the hydrostatic equilibrium equations of tolman , oppenheimer and volkov have to be solved once the equation of state is specified . however , the composition of a neutron star still remains uncertain and the construction of the eos , which is based on the ingredients of the ns s and the kind of interactions which characterize them , is subjected to several assumptions . in any case",
    "the calculated eos has to satisfy the following requirements @xcite :",
    "i ) it must display the correct saturation point for symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) ; ii ) it must give a se compatible with nuclear phenomenology especially at high densities ; iii ) for snm the incompressibility at saturation must be compatible with the values extracted from phenomenology ; iv ) both for neutron matter and snm the speed of sound must not exceed the speed of light ( causality condition ) , at least up to the relevant densities .",
    "in the present work we consider that the neutron star core is composed only by an uncharged mixture of neurons , protons and electrons in equilibrium with respect to the weak interaction ( @xmath2-stable matter ) .",
    "however in general , in the range of densities @xmath3 , the hadronic phase of superdense matter with a rich spectrum of particles ( hyperons , baryonic resonances , @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons , and a small portion of leptons ) is realized .",
    "the model which is used for the construction of the eos is a generalization of a schematic potential model based on a previous work of prakash et al . @xcite .",
    "the model reproduces the results of most microscopic calculations of dense matter @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that there many ways to determine the equation of state through the many - body approach of interacting hadrons .",
    "some of the most recent ones are based on variational methods @xcite and some are based on microscopic calculations @xcite . in order to face the problem that stems from the uncertain behavior of the se at high densities we perform a suitable parameterization both in low and high densities . in the previous work of prakash et al @xcite the parameterization of the potential term of the se is achieved by the introduction of three different choices of the potential contribution to the se . to advance , in the present work , we suggest a more generalized parameterization of the potential term of the se which is more flexible and efficient , reproduces the predictions of most microscopic calculations of dense matter @xcite and confirms the results of various empirical data .",
    "the most striking feature of the proposed parameterization is the different form of the parameterization function @xmath6 for densities below saturation point and for densities above this point .",
    "this is not surprising since this was already entailed in microscopic calculations .",
    "although the behavior of the se for densities below the saturation point still remains unknown , significant progress has been made only most recently in constraining the se at subnormal densities and around the normal density from the isospin diffusion data in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "this has led to a significantly more refined constraint on neutron - skin thickness of heavy nuclei @xcite and the mass - radius correlation of neutron stars @xcite . for densities above the saturation point the trend of the se is model dependent and exhibits completely different behavior .    the above characteristic of the se is well reflected in our proposed models . in view of the previous comment ,",
    "the proposed parameterization of the potential term of the se has the advantage to be able to reproduce microscopic calculations in cases where the se , at low densities , increases along with the density and then begins to fall although the density continues to increase .",
    "this is a well known characteristic of a class of skyrme interactions @xcite and of gogny hartree - fock calculations @xcite .",
    "special effort has been devoted to find analytical relations between the radius @xmath7 and the pressure @xmath8 which correspond to a special density @xmath9 for a fixed value of the mass @xmath10 of the neutron star .",
    "so an accurate determination of a neutron star radius will permit evaluation of the pressure of neutron star matter .",
    "all the above will provide a direct determination of the density dependence of the nuclear se at these densities @xcite .",
    "finally , we also address on the problem of neutron star cooling @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the direct urca process can occur in neutron stars if the proton concentration exceeds some critical value in the range of 11 - 15 % .",
    "the proton concentration can be determined by the trend of the se especially just above the equilibrium density .",
    "so , the detailed knowledge of the se behavior is crucial for the existence of the direct urca process .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "@xmath11 the proposed model and the relatives formulas are discussed and analyzed .",
    "results are reported and discussed in section @xmath12 , while the summary of the work is given in section @xmath13 .",
    "in general , the energy per baryon of neutron - rich matter may be written as @xmath14 to a good approximation , it is sufficient to retain in the above expansion only the quadratic term . thus , the above equation takes the form @xmath15 where @xmath9 is the baryon density ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 is the proton fraction ( @xmath18 ) . the symmetry energy @xmath19 can be expressed in terms of the difference of the energy per baryon between neutron ( @xmath20 ) and symmetry ( @xmath21 ) matter @xmath22    in the present work we consider a schematic equation for symmetric nuclear matter energy ( energy per baryon @xmath23 or equivalently the energy density per nuclear density @xmath24 ) which is given by the expression @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fermi energy per baryon in equilibrium state and @xmath0 is the saturation density .",

    "are determined in order that @xmath42 mev , @xmath43 @xmath44 and @xmath45 mev . in general",
    "the parameter values for three possible values of the compression modulus @xmath46 @xmath47 are displayed in table i , on ref .",
    "@xcite .    to a very good approximation",
    ", the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath48 can be parameterized as follows @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the se at the saturation point , @xmath51 . in general ,",
    "theoretical predictions give @xmath52 mev . in the present work we consider @xmath53 mev .",
    "the function @xmath6 parameterizes the potential contribution of the nuclear se and has to satisfy the constraints @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "equation ( [ esym-2 ] ) can be written in a more instructive form by separating the kinetic and the potential contribution of the se .",
    "@xmath56    in the previous work of prakash et .",
    "@xcite , three representative forms that mimic the results of most microscopic models are used and have the following form @xmath57    in the present work we generalize the previous form of the function @xmath6 in two ways .",
    "first , the function @xmath6 is parameterized as follows @xmath58 where the parameter @xmath59 ( hereafter called potential parameter ) varies between @xmath60 in order to get reasonable values for the se .",
    "it is obvious that according to the above formula the trend of the potential part is the same both in low and high values of the baryon density .",
    "the information gained from microscopic theoretical calculations shows that this is not the general case for the potential part of the se . on the contrary ,",
    "the se exhibits different trends in low and high densities .",
    "so , one should try to find a new formula for the function @xmath6 which satisfies the above restrictions . in the spirit of the previous statement we propose a new parameterization of the function @xmath6 .",
    "the new function which is more flexible compared to the previous ones , reproduces the se for most realistic calculations and has the following form @xmath61    the function @xmath6 satisfies the constraints @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the derivative of the function , compared to equation ( [ fu-1 ] ) , is determined by the parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 ( hereafter called potential parameters ) .    in order to construct the nuclear equation of state , the expression of the pressure is needed . in general , the pressure , at temperature @xmath66 ,",
    "is given by the expression @xmath67    from equations ( [ en-1 ] ) , ( [ esnm-1 ] ) and ( [ pres-1 ] ) we found that the contribution of the baryon to the total pressure is given by the relation @xmath68 + n_s(1 - 2x)^2 u^2 \\frac{d e_{sym}(u)}{d u } .\\ ] ]    the leptons ( electrons and muons ) originating for the condition of the beta stable matter contribute also to the total energy and total pressure @xcite . to be more precise",

    "what remains is the determination of the proton fraction @xmath17 in @xmath2-stable matter . in that case",

    "it is worthwhile to notice that the present model satisfies the relativistic causality .",
    "that means the speed of sound which was defined from the relation , @xmath94 does not exceed the speed of light for any value of the baryon density .",
    "this is a basic treat for any realistic eos , regardless the details of the interactions among matter constituents or the many body approach @xcite .",
    "the most efficient process , which leads to a fast cooling of a neutron star , is the direct urca process involving nucleons @xmath95    this process is only permitted if energy and momentum can be simultaneously conserved @xcite .",
    "this requires that the proton fraction must be @xmath96 . from equation ( [ prf-1 ] ) it is obvious that the proton fraction @xmath17 is sensitive to the density dependence of the se and as consequence to the parameterization of the potential part of @xmath1 .",
    "so , in the present work it is worthwhile to study the relation of the proton fraction and the relative parameterization and also to check if our parameterization satisfies the constraints for the beggining of the urca process .    in order to calculate the gross properties of a ns we assume that a ns has a spherically symmetric distribution of mass in hydrostatic equilibrium and is extremely cold ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "this point defines r as the coordinate radius of the star .",
    "to do this , one needs an initial value of the pressure at @xmath100 , called @xmath102 .",

    ", we studied the correlations between the derivative of the symmetry energy @xmath187 and the radius @xmath130 close to the saturation point @xmath140 . in figure 7a",
    "we plot the radius @xmath130 versus the derivative of the symmetry energy @xmath139 for fixed values of the potential parameter @xmath65 .",
    "one can see that there is a linear relation between @xmath130 and @xmath139 just like in figure 3a .",
    "the effect of the parameter @xmath65 is to induce a parallel shift of the best fit lines . in figure",
    "7b we indicate the inverse relation , that means @xmath139 versus @xmath130 .",
    "the least - squares fit values for both cases and for various values of the parameter @xmath65 are given for the following equations @xmath188",
    "@xmath189 @xmath190    in figure 8a , likewise with the figure 4a we display the ratio @xmath143 as a function of the density for various cases .",
    "it is obvious that the relativistic causality is satisfied once again . in figure",
    "8b we display the proton fraction @xmath144 as a function of the density for various cases . a more systematic study of the @xmath144 leads to the conclusion that the potential parameter @xmath64 plays the most critical role for the occurence of the urca process .",
    "specifically a higher value of the @xmath64 leads to the beggining urca process in smaller values of the baryon density .",
    "figure 9 illustrates the behavior of the quantity @xmath161 as a function of the radii @xmath130 for pressure determined at @xmath191 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and also for @xmath192 ( figure 9a ) , @xmath193 ( figure 9b ) and @xmath194 ( figure 9c ) .",
    "in figure 10 we plot the quantity @xmath195 as a function of @xmath130 for the pressure determined at @xmath191 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and for @xmath192 ( figure 10a ) , @xmath193 ( figure 10b ) and @xmath194 ( figure 10c ) .",
    "it is obvious once again that the quantity @xmath195 is almost constant only when the pressure is calculated at the saturation point @xmath0 .",
    "when the pressure is calculated at densities @xmath140 and @xmath196 the quantity @xmath195 is an increasing function of the radius @xmath130 .",
    "thus , as in the case of the simple parameterization of the se , it is concluded that there is a dependence of the quantity @xmath195 from the first potential parameter @xmath64 as well as from the second potential parameter @xmath65 and consequently from the trend of the se both for low and high values of the baryon density .",
    "in the present work we performed a systematic study of the effect of the potential part of the se on the global properties of neutron stars ( masses , radii and composition ) .",
    "the potential part of the se was parameterized in a generalized form both for low and high values of the baryon density in order to be efficient in reproducing the results of most microscopic calculations of dense nuclear matter .    in the case of the simple parameterization of the se the most striking feature of our study was the derivation of a linear relation which stands between the maximum mass @xmath133 , the radius @xmath127 and the radius @xmath130 with the potential parameter c. in addition",
    ", a linear relation stands between the @xmath130 and the derivative of @xmath197 for densities close to the saturation point ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "it was concluded that quantity @xmath161 ( with @xmath165 and @xmath166 fitting parameters ) appears to be constant for the densities @xmath199 .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath195 exhibits an increasing behavior as a function of @xmath130 for @xmath200 .    in the case of the more complicated parameterization , where the se is parameterized in a different way for low and high values of the density ,",
    "similar results were taken .",
    "specifically @xmath130 is a function of both potential parameters @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this means that the value of @xmath130 is affected from the density dependent trend of the se , both in low and high densities .",
    "however , we showed that for fixed values of the parameter @xmath65 , close to the saturation point ( @xmath140 ) , a linear relation between the @xmath130 and the @xmath139 stands .",
    "finally , the quantity @xmath201 appears to be constant after a suitable parameterization of the parameters @xmath165 and @xmath166 but still remains dependent from the second potential parameter @xmath65 . the quantity @xmath195 , as in the previous case , exhibits an increasing behavior as a function of the @xmath130 for density values above the saturation point .",
