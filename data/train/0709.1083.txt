    "this is a new aspect of the gluonic phase at @xmath47 , which is not shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "since the phase transitions from the gluonic phase to the chromomagnetically stable 2sc / g2sc phases are of second - order or weakly first - order , we expect that the corresponding critical line shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ( i.e. , the right branch of the thick solid line ) is not drastically altered by the self - consistent analysis .",

    "the low - temperature region of the g2sc phase and a part of the 2sc phase is replaced by the gluonic phase .",
    "furthermore , the gluonic phase wins against a part of the nq phase and enlarges its region .",
    "we argue therefore that the gluonic phase which could resolve the chromomagnetic instability related to gluons 47 is a strong candidate for the ground state of a neutral two - flavor color superconductor in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "alternatives include other types of the gluonic phases @xcite , the crystalline phases @xcite and the mixed phase @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that , at @xmath4 , the gluonic color - spin locked phase is more stable than the gluonic cylindrical phase ii in some region of @xmath10 and moreover is free from the chromomagnetic instability at moderate densities @xcite .",
    "although we concentrated on the phase diagram in @xmath3-@xmath10 plane in this work , it is obviously worthwhile to revisit the phase diagram in @xmath3-@xmath80 plane . a preliminary study @xcite indicates that currently known phase diagrams @xcite must be significantly altered . in addition , the critical temperature for the gluonic phase could reach a few tens of mev and , therefore , it is interesting to study astrophysical implications of the gluonic phase , e.g. , the quark matter equation of state , neutrino emission from compact star cores , and so on",
    ".      finally we briefly look at a mixed phase consisting of the nq and the 2sc phases @xcite . for the mixed phase to exist",

    ", there still is a wide window where the mixed phase is more stable than the g2sc phase , but the mixed phase is less favored than the gluonic phase .",
    "it should be mentioned here that , however , we did not take into account the thickness of the boundary layer , which has been estimated to be comparable to the value of the debye screening length in each of the two phases , and therefore the results shown in fig .",
