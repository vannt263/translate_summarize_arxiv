    "factorized cross sections in perturbative qcd separate universal parton densities from process - specific factors that describe the perturbative hard scattering of the partons @xcite .",
    "these factors , or hard - scattering functions , may include singular distributions , defined by their integrals with smooth functions , such as the parton densities relevant to the process . to be specific , for the production of a system of mass @xmath0 , through the collision of partons of invariant mass squared @xmath1 , the hard - scattering function will contain , at @xmath2th order , terms as singular as @xmath3_+$ ] , with @xmath4 .",
    "the limit @xmath5 is the edge of partonic phase space , or partonic threshold , at which no energy remains for qcd radiation .",
    "these singular contributions often increase the cross section .",
    "the classic case is the production of drell - yan pairs , with @xmath6 the invariant mass of the electroweak vector boson produced by the annihilation of a quark pair .",
    "the possibility of controlling such singular distributions to all orders in perturbation theory was recognized early @xcite , and the full analysis , including nonleading logarithms was carried out @xcite . the formalism is closely related to the even earlier resummation of logarithms in the transverse momenta of the pairs @xcite .",
    "finally , it was noted that the resummation in logarithms of @xmath7 can be performed , not only for the fully inclusive drell - yan cross section @xmath8 , but also for the cross section at fixed rapidity , @xmath9 @xcite . we will have occasion to recall and employ the explicit forms of these resummations below .    in this paper , we shall derive threshold resummation for several physically - relevant dijet cross sections at large momentum transfer .",
    "we will find both similarities and differences compared to drell - yan and related cross sections , due to the color content of partons emerging from the hard scattering .",
    "one difference is that in jet production the hard scattering is itself a qcd subprocess , and involves color exchange .",
    "another is that the kinematics at threshold depend upon the method used to define the event .",
    "we shall see that both of these features of jet production influence higher - order corrections in an essential way .",
    "the broad outlines of our reasoning , however , follow the derivation of resummation from factorization , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when a hard process is mediated by qcd , rather than color - singlet electroweak annihilation , the situation becomes , not surprisingly , more complex .",
    "nevertheless , it is not difficult to recognize that the leading threshold logarithms associated with the initial state are the same for qcd processes as for drell - yan at each order in perturbation theory .",
    "this observation was made the basis for the first estimates of the effects of resummed perturbation theory in heavy quark production @xcite .",
    "the extension to nonleading logarithmic corrections has been carried out recently for heavy quarks @xcite . at this level , intriguing effects begin to show up , in which the color structure of the underlying hard scattering influences the pattern of soft radiation near threshold .",
    "these results are related to the long - standing program of developing observable consequences of qcd coherence , in which properties of hadronic final states reflect color flow in partonic subprocesses @xcite .    for dijet ( as opposed to heavy quark ) production",
    ", threshold singularities also differ from the drell - yan case because of the presence of the final - state jets , of momentum @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "when the cross section is evaluated at fixed dijet total invariant mass , @xmath12 , these differences turn out to be at the level of next - to - leading logarithm in the singular distributions .",
    "as we shall show , however , when the cross section is evaluated at fixed @xmath13 , new leading - logarithmic contributions arise , which are negative .",
    "depending on the partonic subprocess , these new contributions may even overcome the enhancements from initial state interactions , and produce an overall suppression of the cross section , relative to lowest order .",
    "the resummation of singular distributions at partonic threshold is important because corrections very close to the edge of phase space may be numerically large , and taken at leading logarithm often ( although not always ) grow , rather than decrease , with the order @xcite .",
    "the resummed cross section also requires integrals over the argument of the running coupling @xcite , indicating enhanced sensitivity to soft gluon effects , and suggesting the necessity of incorporating nonperturbative corrections . in addition",
    ", the resummation of threshold singularities in qcd hard scattering requires a general approach to the interplay of color exchange at short distances with the pattern of gluon radiation into the final state @xcite .",
    "we shall see that beyond leading logarithms it is in general not possible to separate initial from final state emission , and that , in fact , the color structure of the hard scattering directly influences the flow of energy into the final state , not only at low order , but to all orders in perturbation theory .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall make strong use of the factorization properties of gauge theory cross sections at high energy . the basic complication in these arguments arises from the divergences of massless field theories in minkowski space , in which the separation of long- and short - distance dynamics must be carried out relative to the light - like directions intrinsic to the problem .",
    "the principles and methods underlying the arguments below have been developed , for instance , in refs .",
    "we shall try , however , to make the discussion relatively self - contained , and to explain our use of technical results as they arise .",
    "we begin in sec .  2 by identifying the cross sections , based on cone algorithms for jets , which we shall use as illustrative examples in this paper .",
    "in the following two sections , we go on to discuss the factorization properties of these cross sections ( sec .",
    "3 ) , and then to give interpretations for the various functions that appear in the factorized cross section in terms of field - theoretic matrix elements of nonlocal operators ( sec .  4 ) .",
    "the pattern of these arguments is close to that used previously for resummation in heavy quark cross sections @xcite , but now modified to treat the extra collinear divergences associated with the final - state jets . in sec .  5",
    ", we organize the singular behavior of each of the component functions of the factorization formula . as in the case of heavy quarks",
    ", we identify an anomalous dimension matrix , which controls color - sensitive gluon radiation into the final state . combining these results , we give the resummed expressions for dijet cross sections in moment space .",
