    "a proposal for a gravity theory with non - symmetric metric began with an idea of einstein to unify gravity and electromagnetism ( refs .  ) .",
    "in general relativity , the metric of the riemannian manifold is a symmetric bilinear form .",
    "interpreted as an invertible map from the tangent to the cotangent space , it is natural to allow also an anti - symmetric part . while the original hope of einstein that the anti - symmetric part of a non - symmetric metric tensor may be directly related to the electromagnetic force turned out to be incorrect , there is nevertheless phenomenological interest in non - symmetric gravity theories .",
    "et al . _ ( ref .  ) discussed the problems associated with the construction of non - symmetric gravity theories , where theories were typically in need for treatment of ghost terms .",
    "there have since been numerous studies on the topic ( refs .  ) . on the other hand , generalized geometry ( refs .  ) , which incorporates symmetries of string theory ( t - duality , @xmath0-transform ) and spacetime geometry ( diffeomorphisms ) seems to offer a well - suited geometrical framework for string theory as well as non - symmetric gravity theories .",
    "generalized geometry as an extension of riemannian geometry can reproduce the einstein - hilbert and supergravity actions ( refs .  ) . in the present work ,",
    "we consider an alternative approach that naturally incorporates torsion .",
    "for a recent work on metric connections with skew torsion in riemannian geometry , see ref .  .",
    "an alternative approach to einstein - hilbert type actions using structures of generalized geometry can be found in ref .  .",
    "we consider a vector bundle @xmath1 .",
    "the elements of the space of sections of the vector bundle are formal sums @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a vector field and @xmath4 is a one - form .",
    "we have a natural pairing @xmath5 which is symmetric and non - degenerate .",
    "the signature of the pairing is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the spacetime dimension of @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the pairing is invariant under @xmath10 transformations .",
