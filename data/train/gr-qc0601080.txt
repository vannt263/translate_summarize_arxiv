    "hyperboloidal hypersurfaces have gained some importance in the study of radiative systems in general relativity .",
    "this is because in a sense they interpolate between space - like hypersurfaces which become asymptotically flat and null hypersurfaces which extend out to null - infinity .",
    "since these hypersurfaces are space - like one can use them to formulate an initial - value formulation for the einstein equations and because they extend to null - infinity one has in principle full control over the radiation which propagates outward .",
    "one can even go further and compactify the space - time following the work of penrose  @xcite and arrive at the system of conformal field equations set up by friedrich  @xcite . for a review on these matters see  @xcite .    in the asymptotically flat regions of a space - time",
    "hyperboloidal hypersurfaces behave like the space - like hyperboloids in minkowski space - time .",
    "these are defined by @xmath0 .",
    "they are the only everywhere smooth spherically symmetric hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature in minkowski space - time .",
    "they also have constant negative curvature @xmath1 . when studying the properties of hyperboloidal hypersurfaces in simple examples like the schwarzschild and kruskal space - times we noticed that much is known for hypersurfaces with constant mean curvature ( see  @xcite and references therein ) , while the class of hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature ( csc ) seems to have been ignored .",
    "therefore , we decided to explore this class of hypersurfaces in some detail .    we find that hypersurfaces in this class are characterised by three constants : the scalar curvature , the location of the hypersurface in space - time ( i.e.  an event in space - time lying on the hypersurface ) , and an integration constant .",
    "the hypersurfaces can be space - like or time - like . the latter ones either connect the white - hole singularity with the black - hole singularity or they stop with a diverging extrinsic curvature somewhere inside the white - hole .",
    "most space - like hypersurfaces connect one asymptotic region of the kruskal extension with the other one .",
    "but they all remain below the bifurcation sphere .",
    "there is another class of space - like hypersurfaces which come in from null - infinity and reach a minimal radius where the extrinsic curvature diverges .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : initialdata ] we solve the constraints for a hypersurface with constant negative scalar curvature . in sect .",
    "[ sec : embedding ] we discuss the embedding equation for such hypersurfaces in schwarzschild and derive the qualitative behaviour of the embedded slices . in sect .",
    "[ sec : kruskal ] we look at the behaviour of the hypersurfaces in the kruskal extension of the schwarzschild space - time and close the paper with a short discussion of our findings .",
    "in this first section we want to determine spherically symmetric initial data @xmath2 on a 3-dimensional hypersurface  @xmath3 with constant scalar curvature . in our discussion",
    "we follow closely the treatment of  @xcite .",
    "first we determine the spherically symmetric metrics with constant scalar curvature and then proceed to solve the vacuum constraints for the extrinsic curvature .",
    "we are interested in spherically symmetric 3-dimensional metrics with constant negative scalar curvature @xmath4 on a 3-manifold @xmath3 .",
    "these can be obtained directly by solving the equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary positive constant on @xmath3 .",
    "the general spherically symmetric metric on a 3-dimensional manifold can be written in the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the geodesic radial distance on the 3-manifold and @xmath9 is the metric on the unit 2-sphere .",
    "the function @xmath10 determines the radius @xmath11 of the spheres of symmetry and hence determines the intrinsic geometry .",
    "we find the scalar curvature for this metric and obtain the equation @xmath12 multiplying with @xmath13 and rearranging we obtain the equation . ] @xmath14 which can be integrated once @xmath15 with an integration constant @xmath16 .",
    "then we can write @xmath17 and this equation can not be integrated in closed form any further .",
    "the explicit solution involves elliptic integrals and is not very illuminating .",
    "however , writing @xmath18 and introducing @xmath11 as a new coordinate , the metric takes the form @xmath19 clearly , rescaling the metric with a constant @xmath20 so that @xmath21 rescales the scalar curvature @xmath22 so that @xmath23 .",
    "this can also be seen from   which , in addition , reveals that @xmath24 .",
    "note that the transition to this form   of the metric is valid only as long as @xmath25 .",
    "we consider now the vacuum constraints .",
    "they are written as @xmath26 here @xmath27 denotes the covariant derivative compatible with the metric @xmath28 and @xmath29 . using the spherical symmetry we find that the extrinsic curvature necessarily has the form @xmath30 for two functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath33-tensor @xmath34 is diagonal in the given coordinate basis with components @xmath35 hence , the trace of the extrinsic curvature is @xmath36 thus defining the mean curvature @xmath37 . expressing @xmath38 in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 as @xmath41 and inserting into the constraints we have @xmath42 here the metric has a constant negative scalar curvature @xmath4 , which we write as @xmath1 as before . rescaling the metric with a constant @xmath43 results by virtue of the constraint equations in a rescaling of the extrinsic curvature @xmath44 with @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "when @xmath2 is a solution of the constraints , then @xmath45 is also a solution .",
    "we first solve the hamiltonian constraint for the function  @xmath40 @xmath46 and insert this into the momentum constraint .",
    "we get the equation @xmath47 this equation has the solution @xmath48 for some constant of integration @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 the mean curvature is defined for all values of @xmath11 , while for @xmath51 there is only a limited range given by @xmath52 .",
    "this means that the hypersurface has to stop somewhere because the extrinsic curvature blows up .",
    "for @xmath53 we have constant mean curvature . from   we find @xmath54 and , finally , @xmath55 the ambiguity in sign is inherent in the vacuum constraints because with @xmath44 also @xmath56 is a solution of the constraints .",
    "it corresponds to the choice of the time orientation .",
    "we will concentrate in the following on the @xmath57 sign , the case where the mean curvature is positive . then @xmath58 and approaches @xmath6 for @xmath59 .",
    "so far we have not considered the fact that the hypersurface should be embedded in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "this can be taken into account by the consideration of the misner - sharp mass  @xcite .",
    "this mass @xmath60 is defined in a spherically symmetric space - time by the equation @xmath61 where , in our case , @xmath62 , and it has the property that in the schwarzschild space - time it is constant , equal to the mass parameter @xmath63 .",
    "inserting @xmath64 from   and @xmath65 from above we obtain a relation between the integration constants @xmath49 , @xmath16 , and @xmath6 @xmath66 in particular , substituting into , the mean curvature in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath16 is @xmath67 remarkably , the case @xmath68 , in which @xmath69 and also @xmath70 , characterises a hypersurface with constant mean curvature and constant scalar curvature , for which the extrinsic curvature is ` pure trace ' @xmath71 .",
    "in the next two sections we ask how hypersurfaces with the intrinsic and extrinsic geometries determined in the previous sections can be embedded into the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "we first discuss this question in the well - known chart of schwarzschild coordinates and discuss the qualitative behaviour of the hypersurfaces .",
    "then we write down a system of equations for use in the kruskal completion of the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "we consider the schwarzschild space - time and write its metric in the usual schwarzschild coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath11 .",
    "however , in order to simplify the formulae we rescale the coordinates with @xmath73 , i.e. we measure them in units of the schwarzschild radius .",
    "then the areal radius is @xmath74 . in these coordinates the metric is @xmath75 which is valid for @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "we locate a spherically symmetric hypersurface by using a height - function @xmath78 with an equation of the form @xmath79 for such a hypersurface one can find the intrinsic metric , the normal vector , and the extrinsic curvature expressed in terms of derivatives of the height function . the intrinsic metric is @xmath80 with @xmath81 notice , the hypersurface will be space - like ( resp .",
    "time - like , null ) whenever @xmath82 ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) .",
    "defining @xmath85 , the normal unit vector is @xmath86 this vector is chosen such that it is future - pointing whenever @xmath82 . from this expression",
    "we compute the extrinsic curvature @xmath87 and obtain for the function @xmath40 and @xmath39 the following expressions @xmath88 we have two conditions on the height - function @xmath78 : @xmath89 the intrinsic metric should be of the form   and @xmath90 the mean curvature should be given by   with the positive sign .",
    "from condition @xmath89 we find , after adjusting the @xmath11 coordinate and redefining the constants @xmath91 and @xmath92 , that @xmath93 holds .",
    "solving this equation for @xmath94 yields @xmath95 condition @xmath90 implies with @xmath96 @xmath97 which can be integrated once to the equation @xmath98 this can be transformed into an expression for @xmath94 @xmath99 thus , the two conditions on @xmath94 agree if and only if @xmath100 i.e. if and only if the relation   between the integration constants holds .    for large @xmath11",
    "we get @xmath101 and from the two branches of @xmath94 we restrict ourselves to the positive sign for which @xmath102 . in this case",
    ", the hypersurface extends out to future null - infinity .",
    "so we define @xmath103 then we have the embedding equation @xmath104      clearly , in the schwarzschild space - time , where the only relevant coordinate is the radial coordinate @xmath11 , the hypersurfaces given by @xmath105 are necessarily also hypersurfaces of constant scalar curvature .",
    "these hypersurfaces can not be obtained by using a height - function .",
    "they are time - like outside the horizon and space - like inside .",
    "obviously , is singular at the horizon @xmath106 .",
    "but , since the singularity at @xmath106 is only a coordinate singularity , this does not imply that the hypersurface itself ends at the horizon .",
    "this can be seen in several ways .",
    "we switch to a different time coordinate @xmath107 so that the schwarzschild metric takes the form @xmath108 which is manifestly regular at the horizon . with this time",
    "coordinate the hypersurface is given by the equation @xmath109 and we get @xmath110 except for the special case when @xmath111 , the function @xmath112 is smooth at @xmath106 with @xmath113 .",
    "hence , the function @xmath114 is smooth as well at @xmath106 , so that the hypersurfaces extend smoothly across the horizon .",
    "the exceptional case @xmath111 will be discussed below .",
    "knowing that the hypersurfaces are smooth across the horizon we restrict ourselves in our discussion to the usual schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "the crucial object in our consideration are the polynomials @xmath115 in terms of which we get @xmath116 the behaviour of the hypersurfaces is characterised by the zeros of numerator and denominator of @xmath117 .",
    "since both polynomials are increasing with @xmath11 they can have at most one zero .",
    "from the metric   it follows that the dependence of the areal radius on the geodesic distance is given by the equation @xmath118 therefore , the zero of @xmath119 is the extremal value of the area of the spheres of symmetry .",
    "the sign of @xmath120 decides about the causal character of the hypersurfaces . for positive values the hypersurfaces are space - like and for negative values they are time - like .",
    "since at these values the second derivative of @xmath11 with respect to @xmath8 is @xmath121 these are minimal surfaces when the hypersurfaces are space - like and they are maximal surfaces when they are time - like .",
    "we notice , at the extremal point the hypersurface is tangent to the hypersurface of constant @xmath11 through that point .",
    "it follows from equation   that @xmath122 is negative for all values of @xmath11 .",
    "so @xmath37 is decreasing with @xmath11 , which implies that @xmath39 is maximal at the extremal point in the space - like case , while it is minimal in the time - like case .",
    "at the zero of the numerator of @xmath117 we have @xmath123 comparison with  ,  , and shows that these are the locations where the extrinsic curvature blows up .",
    "this implies that the surfaces stop at this radius because they can no longer be embedded into the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "the extremal surface is located at the point with @xmath124 , while the extrinsic curvature diverges at the point with @xmath125 .",
    "the location of these points is determined by the values of the constants @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the graph of the polynomial @xmath120 always intersects the abscissa with slope @xmath128 .",
    "the value at the intersection is @xmath129 .",
    "since @xmath119 grows unboundedly for large @xmath11 with a rate given by @xmath130 and since @xmath127 determines the intersection at @xmath131 , we have generically three main cases ( the non - generic special cases will be discussed in the next section ) characterised by the intersection points of the polynomial with the line @xmath132 . of course",
    ", the hypersurfaces can exist only in regions in which @xmath120 and @xmath133 have the same sign , i.e. when the polynomial takes positive values and lies above @xmath134 or when the polynomial takes negative values and lies below @xmath134 .",
    "the various cases are     and its relation to the line @xmath134 for different values of @xmath126 and @xmath127.,width=302 ]    1 .   @xmath135 . in this case @xmath136 and @xmath137 for all @xmath138 , so there are no extremal surfaces and no singularities .",
    "the surfaces exist for all @xmath11 and they are space - like . 2 .",
    "again , @xmath140 but @xmath120 becomes negative for small values of @xmath11 .",
    "there is a zero at a value @xmath141 .",
    "so the surfaces in this case have a minimal surface but no singularity .",
    "the hypersurfaces are space - like .",
    "they come in from null - infinity reach a minimal hypersurface at @xmath142 and then extend out again to null - infinity .",
    "3 .   @xmath143 .",
    "this is a more complicated case .",
    "for all values of @xmath126 the polynomial @xmath119 has a zero at a value @xmath144 and intersects the line @xmath134 at a value @xmath145 .",
    "we have to distinguish two subcases : 1 .",
    "@xmath146 . in this case",
    "the hypersurfaces exist in the region @xmath148 where they are time - like and @xmath149 where they are space - like .",
    "the time - like hypersurfaces reach the schwarzschild singularity at @xmath131 and grow towards larger radii but stop at @xmath150 where their extrinsic curvature diverges .",
    "the space - like hypersurfaces come in from null - infinity and , crossing the horizon , reach a minimal surface with radius @xmath142 .",
    "then they go out again to null - infinity .",
    "2 .   @xmath151 . here",
    "@xmath152 and the two regions for existence of the hypersurfaces are reversed .",
    "the hypersurfaces on @xmath153 extending from the singularity are time - like , grow towards a surface of maximal radius and then shrink back to @xmath131 .",
    "the outer hypersurfaces on @xmath154 are space - like , come in from null - infinity and end at @xmath155 with a diverging extrinsic curvature .",
    "the kruskal extension of the schwarzschild space - time is covered by coordinates @xmath156 and @xmath157 which are related to the schwarzschild coordinates by the relations @xmath158 in these coordinates the metric takes the form @xmath159 where @xmath11 has to be regarded as a function of @xmath160 via  .      to obtain the embedding equation in terms of the kruskal",
    "coordinates we write @xmath11 and @xmath72 as functions of some parameter @xmath8 , so that @xmath161 , and then regard also @xmath157 and @xmath156 as functions of @xmath8 . using the relationship between the coordinates and the embedding equation one derives the equations @xmath162 with @xmath163 one derives easily the equation for the height function @xmath164 as @xmath165 from which it is obvious , that the horizon at @xmath106 is not a concern . from this form of the embedding equation one",
    "quickly derives the following symmetry properties of the solutions .",
    "if @xmath166 is a solution of the equation with @xmath167 taken from the positive branch of the square root , then @xmath168 is a solution for @xmath169 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath166 is a solution for positive @xmath170 , then @xmath171 is a solution for @xmath169 .    in order to derive further properties we write down the embedding equation in parametric form by choosing @xmath172 as the geodesic distance along the radial directions and we arrive at the system @xmath173 in terms of the null coordinates @xmath174 and @xmath175 this system can be written as @xmath176 we list some of the obvious properties of the system :    1 .   in the asymptotic region",
    "@xmath59 we have @xmath177 which implies that the hypersurfaces approach the light cones @xmath178 for large  @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   similarly , for large values of the parameter  @xmath126 the hypersurfaces approach null hypersurfaces .",
    "this can easily be seen already from the form of the metric  .",
    "with @xmath179 it is clear that the metric degenerates for @xmath180 .",
    "note that the case @xmath181 for @xmath59 referred to in sect  [ subsec : schwarzschild ] corresponds to a hypersurface which approaches future null - infinity for large values of @xmath156 , while the case @xmath182 gives a hypersurface approaching future null - infinity in the other asymptotic region of the kruskal extension where @xmath183 .",
    "this implies that for hypersurfaces connecting both null - infinities we have to consider @xmath170 and @xmath169 .",
    "changing the branch of @xmath184 corresponds to the interchange of @xmath185 and  @xmath186 , i.e. to @xmath187 .",
    "similarly , the system is invariant under the transformation @xmath188 .",
    "these transformations together correspond to the @xmath189 .",
    "so we can restrict ourselves to consider only hypersurfaces which lie in the region @xmath190 , corresponding to the regions  i and  iii in the standard kruskal extension .",
    "5 .   at the extremal surfaces given by @xmath124 we have",
    "@xmath191 this means that at these points @xmath192 , so that the hypersurfaces touch the hypersurface @xmath105 at these points .",
    "6 .   at the locations with @xmath193 , where the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurfaces diverges",
    ", we have @xmath194 in this case , the condition implies that @xmath195 , i.e. the hypersurfaces touch the hypersurface @xmath196 through that point .",
    "the horizon at @xmath106 corresponds to the two null lines in the kruskal extension defined by either @xmath197 or @xmath198 . in order to see the behaviour of the system close to these lines we need to expand the function @xmath199 for small @xmath185 , respectively @xmath186 .",
    "we make the discussion for the case where @xmath119 and @xmath200 are positive , an analogous argument applies to the case where they are negative .",
    "we have @xmath201 which can be inverted to @xmath202 furthermore , near @xmath106 we have ( in the generic case @xmath203 ) @xmath204 thus , near @xmath106 the system can be written as @xmath205 clearly , in the neighbourhood of @xmath198 the system is regular and has regular solutions .",
    "the hypersurfaces determined by the system cross the horizon @xmath198 in a regular way .",
    "however , the horizon at @xmath197 is different . in this case",
    "there is no way to approach the horizon because the equation becomes singular at @xmath197 .",
    "the behaviour at the two horizons @xmath197 , i.e. @xmath206 , and @xmath198 , i.e. @xmath207 , can be obtained directly from equation  . since @xmath170 is positive ,",
    "we find that @xmath206 is a solution , while @xmath207 is not a solution .",
    "this implies , by uniqueness of solution , that @xmath206 can not be crossed by other solutions , while @xmath207 can be crossed .",
    "let us now discuss the different cases found in the previous section and determine the generic behaviour of the hypersurfaces .",
    "in this case @xmath119 and @xmath200 have no zeros and @xmath208 for @xmath77 , while @xmath209 for @xmath210 .",
    "thus , it is easy to see that @xmath211 for @xmath190 and @xmath212 for @xmath213 .",
    "this implies that a hypersurface which happens to get into region  i where @xmath190 and @xmath213 will approach @xmath197 for large positive values of @xmath8 , while in the other direction it will approach @xmath198 and , because the equation is regular there , it will cross into region  iii , the white hole region , where @xmath214 and hence @xmath212 .",
    "so , in this case , the hypersurfaces emerge from the white hole and extend all the way out towards null - infinity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : case1 ] we show hypersurfaces for @xmath215 .",
    "we exhibit three different classes of hypersurfaces . within each class",
    "there are three hypersurfaces with different values of @xmath126 which go through the same space - time event .",
    "the values of @xmath126 are @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the large values of @xmath126 result in an almost null hypersurface .",
    "three classes of hypersurface in different regions of space - time for the case @xmath215 . within each class",

    "also in this case the hypersurfaces from any space - time event emerge from the singularity at @xmath131 except that now the location @xmath131 is also a point where @xmath220 , so it is a minimal surface .",
    "the hypersurfaces run into the singularity tangentially .      in this case",
    "the polynomial @xmath120 vanishes at @xmath144 between @xmath131 and @xmath106 .",
    "so a corresponding hypersurface has a minimal surface . at that minimal surface",
    "the geometry of the hypersurface is completely regular .",
    "the hypersurface which is space - like comes in from null - infinity at large positive values of @xmath156 , and touches the hypersurface of constant radius @xmath144 in a minimal surface .",
    "tyhere the solution switches the branch and continues on into region  iv where it ultimately reaches the other future null - infinity .",
    "along the way it smoothly crosses both horizons . since one branch of the solution only covers the part of the hypersurface up to the minimal surface , the complete hypersurface is obtained by switching the branch of @xmath221 at the minimal surface .",
    "all the hypersurfaces in this case connect one null - infinity with the other .",
    "they all lie below the throat at @xmath222 .    again , for large values of @xmath126 the hypersurfaces approach null - hypersurfaces . in this case",
    "these are two null - hypersurfaces intersecting in the minimal sphere at @xmath144 outside the singularity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : case2 ] we show again a sample of hypersurfaces with @xmath223 and the same values for @xmath126 and initial conditions as in fig .",

    "dropping the regular term we arrive at the system @xmath237 which has the solution @xmath238 following the hypersurface backward for @xmath239 from any initial point @xmath240 we find that at @xmath241 both @xmath185 and @xmath186 become zero , the hypersurface runs into the origin and stops there .",
    "the singularity at the origin therefore has the consequence that uniqueness of the solution is lost , see  fig .",

    "in this paper we have discussed the class of spherically symmetric hypersurfaces with constant scalar curvature embedded in the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "we found several types of hypersurfaces with qualitatively different behaviour .",
    "we have looked at this class of hypersurfaces because we were interested in finding ways of slicing the schwarzschild space - time with hypersurfaces which become asymptotically hyperboloidal , i.e. for which the scalar curvature approaches a negative constant for large radii .",
    "we can now see that for the subclass of space - like hypersurfaces with @xmath243 one might be able to achieve this .",
    "all of these hypersurfaces connect the two future null - infinities of the kruskal extension .",
    "hypersurfaces with @xmath135 could foliate the regions  i and  iii , i.e. the white hole and the asymptotic region .",
    "however , note that the hypersurfaces shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : case2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : case3a ] do not form a foliation because they intersect .",
    "so one needs to vary the available parameters @xmath126 and @xmath127 , as well as the location of the hypersurface in the space - time , in order to avoid intersections . to illustrate this we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : foliation ]     and equidistant intersection with the @xmath157-axis .",
    "[ fig : foliation],width=302 ]    several hypersurfaces with the fixed value of @xmath217 that are symmetric under @xmath187 .",
    "so they have their minimal surface on the @xmath157-axis . from the intersection of the hypersurfaces with this axis",
    "we can determine the corresponding value of  @xmath127 .",
    "in this part of the space - time the family of hypersurfaces seems to give a foliation , although we have not proved this .",
