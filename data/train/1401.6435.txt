    "nuclear physics plays a key role in our quest to understand the universe.@xcite in recent years , researchers have made remarkable progress in our fundamental understanding of the complex and fascinating system that is the nucleus.@xcite this progress has been driven by new theoretical insights and increased computational power , as well as by experimental access to new isotopes with a large excess of neutrons or protons .",
    "however , while much has been learned so far about nuclear systems and associated phenomena , much remains to be understood .",
    "the facility for rare isotope beams ( frib),@xcite which is a sponsored project of the us department of energy , office of science , will push the frontiers of nuclear science by providing access to the widest range of isotopes possible . for example , to explore changes in shell structure , useful yields of nickel isotopes will be available from @xmath0ni to @xmath1ni , thereby spanning the full range of neutrons in the @xmath2-shells .",
    "the key is for the facility to deliver very high power heavy - ion primary beams,@xcite 400kw minimum , at energies of at least 200mev / u to be used in the production of rare isotopes.@xcite these high - power beams will be generated by a superconducting linear accelerator coupled with a production area designed to operate at high current.@xcite the broad scientific program requires rare - isotope beams at energies ranging from stopped ions in traps@xcite to ions at relativistic energies of hundreds of mev / u .",
    "frib will have these capabilities by using full - energy beams following in - flight separation , stopped ions thermalized using a variety of ion catcher schemes , and reaccelerated ions delivered by the rea superconducting linear post - accelerator.@xcite the goal is to reach reaccelerated beam energies of 1220mev / u . as a result , the full complement of direct reactions ( including high-@xmath3 transfer and deep - inelastic reactions ) will be accessible for experimentation .",
    "an advantage of the in - flight production and reacceleration approach is that isotopes of all elements will normally be available with very short development times and high efficiency ( approaching 10 to 20% )",
    ". the technique will also provide beams of most isotopes , even those with short ( tens of ms ) half - lives .",
    "this offers the possibility to perform experiments , for example , with beams of highly refractory elements along the @xmath4 line of isotones below @xmath5pb , as required to improve @xmath6-process nucleosynthesis models .",

    "the members of the frib theory users group regularly join the annual low - energy nuclear physics community meetings . during the last 10 years",
    ", the theory community has produced two important documents : the ria theory bluebook ( 2005)@xcite and an frib theory users group report ( 2011).@xcite the former report outlined various scientific directions necessary for an impactful theory effort , while the latter focused on issues surrounding education and training of the next generation of theorists , and included results from a survey on the needs of the field .",
    "while the 2011 survey is new from a time perspective , we note that the nsac theory report from 2003@xcite also recommended ways to address pipeline issues .    to address the concerns discussed in the 2011 report , the pipeline of young theorists must be maintained .",
    "in particular , post - doctoral appointments are crucial for r&d career development .",
    "an national frib theory fellow program would address the problem , creating opportunities for young post - doctoral fellows to mature and fostering continuous interactions among theorists and experimentalists .",
    "the need for faculty or laboratory positions in nuclear theory has also been noted in the past , and was the second concern documented in ref .  .",
    "to overcome this problem , a bridging program for young faculty could be developed enabling needed growth into areas of critical need .    the nuclear theory community in the u.s .",
    "has also extended beyond its boundaries .",

    ", doe has created exchange programs for nuclear theorists with selected countries .",
    "these programs should be expanded and include joint graduate education with international partners . ''",
    "there are a number of initiatives already in place , that foment collaborations between countries , namely justipen@xcite , fustipen@xcite , and custipen@xcite , which are theory exchange programs .",
    "in addition , international collaborations in nuclear theory@xcite coordinates theory topical programs between nscl / frib , gsi and riken , to address theoretical issues relevant to those laboratories . finally , the talent initiative in graduate education , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : talent ] below , has also spurted from an international framework .",
    "the theory effort around frib will also play an important role in the development of a broad , modern , and attractive educational curriculum addressing the nuclear many - body problem and related areas .",
    "a thorough knowledge of up - to - date theoretical methods and phenomenology will be required to tackle the theoretical and experimental challenges that will be faced by the next generation of nuclear physicists working in frib science . however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ organization ] , most university low - energy nuclear theory groups are small and , therefore , unable to offer a broad spectrum of advanced research - based nuclear physics courses .",
    "fortunately , with advances in modern educational and computational tools , we are in a situation where globally coordinated efforts can make a significant qualitative difference in the way nuclear physics students are educated .    recently , nuclear physicists in north america and europe have teamed up to launch an educational initiative dubbed nuclear talent ( training in advanced low - energy nuclear theory).@xcite the long - term vision of talent is to develop a coherent graduate curriculum that will provide the foundations for a cross - cutting low - energy nuclear theory research program , and will link modern theoretical approaches with on - going experimental efforts .",
    "to meet these objectives , educational modules are being commissioned from the best teachers and specialists in low - energy nuclear theory .",
    "the resulting unique material is being collected in the form of web - based courses , books , and other educational resources .",
    "the development of such a knowledge base will allow highly specialized university groups to benefit greatly from a broad selection of topics taught by world - leading experts .    in its initial phase",
    ", talent has selected several topics in low - energy nuclear physics for teaching modules .",
    "the range of courses is broad , from nuclear forces and _ ab initio _ approaches , to the theory of complex nuclei , to nuclear reactions and open quantum systems , to nuclear astrophysics , to computational tools for nuclear physics .",
    "some of the topics have already been taught as intensive three - week courses hosted by the european centre for theoretical studies in nuclear physics and related areas in trento , the national institute for nuclear theory in seattle , and ganil in caen .",
    "other courses are in the pipeline , including one at the joint institute for nuclear astrophysics .",
    "one of the major challenges facing talent is to develop a robust model for funding . to this point",
    ", all courses have been run on a voluntary basis , with financial support for students ( lodging and local expenses ) provided by the hosting institutions .",
    "obviously , to put this educational initiative on solid ground , sustainable funding is needed . in addition , a proper model for transferring academic credit must be developed .",
    "there exist examples of educational collaborations between various universities in the u.s . where bilateral agreements have been developed between various colleges of natural science , enabling an economically sustainable model for credit transfers . with such bilateral agreements",
    ", talent courses can be included in course curricula of participating institutions , and teaching duties could also be transferred . with an frib theory center on the horizon ,",
    "there are good prospects for a better coordination of educational efforts in advanced theory of nuclei and nucleonic matter .",
    "while the current talent effort is built around theoretical and experimental activities in north america and europe , its expansion into other regions is envisioned . in particular , considering the scale of experimental efforts in rare - isotope science in japan and china , it is anticipated and hoped that asia will soon join the initiative .",
    "an understanding of the properties of atomic nuclei and their reactions is essential for a complete description of nuclei , an explanation of element formation and the properties of stars , and for present and future energy , defense , and security applications .",
    "this requires a coherent picture across many energy scales , all the way from the interactions between nucleons to the superheavy nuclei and neutron stars .",
    "the roadmap for low - energy nuclear theory is well established.@xcite it involves the extension of _ ab initio _ and configuration interaction approaches all the way to medium - heavy nuclei , and the quest for a universal nuclear density functional that will allow description of all nuclei up to the heaviest elements and neutron stars .",
    "it also includes developments in reaction theory required for a meaningful link to experiment .",
    "the direct coupling from nucleon - nucleon interaction scales ( @xmath35100 mev ) to nuclear binding scales ( @xmath35110 mev ) to collective excitation scales ( @xmath361 mev ) , facilitated by effective field theory , provides a coherent picture of the structure and dynamics of all nuclei and nucleonic matter found in astrophysical environments . to realize this vision , the properties of rare isotopes are an essential guide .    the development of a theoretical framework that connects the light and heavy nuclei , proton - rich and neutron - rich rare isotopes , and dense neutron matter is within reach . in the next decade",
    ", these developments will have profound implications for nuclear physics , nuclear astrophysics , and neighboring areas , such as high - energy astrophysics , fundamental interaction physics , and hadron structure .",
    "with frib , the field has a clear path to achieve its overall scientific goals and to answer the overarching questions .",
    "with frib , we will have the ability to produce the key isotopes now unavailable .",
    "frib will be the world s most powerful facility to explore the rare - isotope frontier , making nearly 80% of the isotopes predicted to exist for elements up to uranium and providing access to beams of the most interesting isotopes . by taking advantage of the unique coupling of crucial data from frib and other radioactive beam facilities with advanced theoretical frameworks and high - performance computing",
