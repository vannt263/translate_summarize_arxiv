    "we refer to the ability to control the binding threshold @xmath111 through the choice of the target sequence @xmath37 _ alone _ as `` programmability '' of the binding threshold . assuming that programmability is a desirable feature of tf - dna interaction ( since sequence changes can be easily accomplished by point mutation if the functional need arises ) , we seek to determine the specifics of the tf - dna interaction , e.g. , the binding matrix @xmath50 , the length of the binding sequence @xmath6 , and the threshold energy @xmath34 , which allow the targets to be _ maximally programmable_.      specifically , let us require programmability of the binding threshold over the entire range @xmath112 , since typical cellular tf concentrations range from a few to a few hundred per cell .",

    "the large value of @xmath153 also provides us with an intuitive understanding of the simple dependence ( [ mu.1 ] ) of the chemical potential @xmath82 on the cellular tf concentration @xmath83 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) . as mentioned already , the expression ( [ mu.1 ] )",
    "is obtained if multiple occupancy of the background sequences is negligible at the tf concentration @xmath83 .",
    "since there is a large number ( i.e. , @xmath153 ) binding sequences which contribute significantly to the net effect of background binding , multiple occupancy of these sequences is indeed not likely if @xmath168 .",
    "thus for @xmath169 , the expression ( [ mu.1 ] ) can be taken as a good approximation of the chemical potential over the typical range of cellular tf concentration @xmath170 , as shown in fig .",

    "we expect this result to hold even if there are multiple target sequences , say @xmath171 , whose binding energy @xmath43 is much lower than @xmath172 , as long as @xmath173 such that @xmath44 is not affected by the addition of these target sequences to the density of states .",
    "having @xmath85 independent of the number of targets is a desirable functional robustness property from a system perspective , since one would nt want to perturb the recognition of the tf s and the existing targets by the addition of a few new targets .",
    "it will be interesting to see to what extent this feature is preserved by studying the energetics of tf s with a large number of target sites , e.g. , the catabolic repressor protein crp in _",

    "finally , we compare the values of the optimal interaction parameters according to our theory to those of the well - studied tf s . from the values listed in table",
    "[ compare ] , we see that all of the available data is in the neighborhood of the expectation based on the maximal programmability criterion .",
    "we do not suggest here that programmability was necessarily the selective driving force that constrained the tf - dna interaction to its observed form ( there could be other reasons , e.g. biochemical restrictions , for the interaction to be of this form ) .",
    "however , the rough correspondence between theory and observation does indicate that it is _ possible _ ( and perhaps even very likely ) that tf s generally have the required energetics for their binding threshold to be programmable over a wide range .    .",

    "@xcite [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     one obvious short - coming of the above comparison is that the three tf s for which the interaction parameters are known are all from bacteriophages and may not represent typical prokaryotic tf s .",

    "the results of a sufficient number of such studies will inform us whether programmability is a generic feature of tf - dna interaction .",

    "<S> we study theoretical `` design principles '' for transcription factor - dna interaction in bacteria , focusing particularly on the statistical interaction of the transcription factors ( tf s ) with the genomic background ( i.e. , the genome without the target sites ) . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce and motivate the concept of _ programmability _ , i.e. the ability to set the threshold concentration for tf binding over a wide range merely by mutating the binding sequence of a target site . </S>",
    "<S> this functional demand , together with physical constraints arising from the thermodynamics and kinetics of tf - dna interaction , leads us to a narrow range of `` optimal '' interaction parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this parameter set agrees well with experimental data for the interaction parameters of a few exemplary prokaryotic tf s . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that tf - dna interaction is indeed programmable . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest further experiments to test whether this is a general feature for a large class of tf s </S>",
    "<S> .    with rapid advances in the sequencing and annotation of entire genomes , the task of understanding the associated regulatory networks becomes increasingly prominent . </S>",
    "<S> currently , many experimental and computational efforts are devoted to deciphering the genetic wiring diagram of a cell @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most of these efforts are focused on locating the functional dna binding sites of transcription factors ( tf s ) . </S>",
    "<S> this knowledge , together with the genomic sequences , will provide a qualitative picture of which gene products may directly affect the expression of which genes . </S>",
    "<S> while obtaining such wiring diagrams is tremendously important for the eventual understanding of gene regulation at the system level , this knowledge in itself is not sufficient for the quantitative understanding of system - level effects . </S>",
    "<S> this has been dramatically shown in a detailed experimental study of the regulation of the _ endo16 _ gene in sea urchin development @xcite , which revealed an intricate regulatory function where a dozen or so tf s control the expression of a _ single _ gene . </S>",
    "<S> it would have been impossible to infer even the gross qualitative features of the transcriptional control from the knowledge of the binding sites alone .    </S>",
    "<S> a major obstacle to progress is the lack of a _ quantitative _ understanding of the physical interaction between the tf s . </S>",
    "<S> however , even the simpler interaction between tf s and dna sequences is not so well - understood quantitatively : it is common to classify a potential tf - binding dna sequence in a `` digital '' manner  either the sequence is designated for tf - binding or it is not . in this view of tf - dna interaction , differences between the tf - binding sequences are only nuisances which impede straightforward bioinformatic methods of target sequence discovery . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> there are plenty of examples where differences between target sequences are known to be _ functionally important _ @xcite . in many cases , </S>",
    "<S> the binding of a tf to one site occurs only in the presence of some other tf , while the binding of the same tf to a different site does not require other tf s . </S>",
    "<S> this is often accomplished by differences in the binding sequences , and is believed to be the basis for combinatorial control and signal integration in gene regulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , different binding sites of the same tf can be `` tuned '' to bind at different tf concentrations , as suggested by a recent study of the _ e.  coli _  </S>",
    "<S> flagella assembly system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if further experimental studies confirm that tuning of binding thresholds is indeed used genome wide to establish desired gene regulatory functions , then tf - dna binding should be regarded more in an `` analog '' instead of a `` digital '' manner .    in this work , we report our theoretical study on the `` design '' of tf - dna interaction , assuming the analog scheme of operation . specifically , we impose the functional requirement that the threshold concentration for tf binding to a site can be controlled over a wide range by the choice of the sequence alone ; we refer to this as the `` programmability '' of tf - dna binding . </S>",
    "<S> taken together with thermodynamic and kinetic constraints , this functional requirement leads to a narrow range of `` optimal '' tf - dna interaction parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare our result to experimentally known parameters for exemplary tf s to determine whether the design of these tf s would indeed _ allow _ the analog scheme of operation .    </S>",
    "<S> to focus our discussion , we limit ourselves exclusively to the case of bacterial tf s which are the best characterized experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> we study both the equilibrium occupancy of a target sequence , and the dynamics of locating the target . </S>",
    "<S> von hippel , berg , and winter have already discussed many aspects of these issues in a series of seminal articles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our study is built firmly upon their work , but includes a number of additional issues : ( i ) the effect of sequence - specific binding to the genomic background ( non - target sequences ) on the equilibrium occupation of a target sequence ; ( ii ) kinetic traps arising statistically from the genomic background , and ( iii ) the desired programmability of tf - dna binding . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the model developed by von hippel and berg , and allow both the sequence - specific and non - specific modes of tf - dna binding . </S>",
    "<S> sequence - specific binding occurs if the binding sequence is sufficiently close to the best binding sequence , and is governed quantitatively by a specificity parameter . for typical bacterial tf s </S>",
    "<S> whose binding sequences are no more than @xmath0 bases long , we find that our physical and functional requirements are best satisfied within a narrow regime of _ intermediate specificity _ , amounting to the loss of about @xmath1 for each additional base mismatch from the best binding sequence . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the kinetic constraint favors a low threshold to non - specfic binding , while the programmability requirement pushes the threshold to larger values . </S>",
    "<S> the optimal trade - off value depends only on the genome size , and lies about @xmath2 above the energy of the best binding sequence for a genome of @xmath3 bases . </S>",
    "<S> these values correspond well with the interaction parameters of a number of well - characterized tf s , which suggests that programmability of tf - dna binding is compatible with the reality of protein - dna interaction and may be used by the organism to accomplish biological functions . </S>",
    "<S> we hope to stimulate further experiments determining the interaction parameters for a wider range of tf s ( see ` discussion ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments could either strengthen or falsify the programmibility concept , depending on whether the interaction parameters are generally in agreement with our prediction . </S>"
