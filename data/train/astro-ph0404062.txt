    "recent measurements of the distance - redshift relation using type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) @xcite obtained using the hubble space telescope further strengthened the evidence that the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing in time @xcite . this accelerated expansion is ascribed to a mysterious component called dark energy that comprises about 70% of the energy density of the universe . in addition to supernova data , additional pieces of evidence come from the combined study of the large scale structure and the cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements @xcite . while the presence of dark energy is by",
    "now well established , we are at an early stage of studying and understanding this component .",
    "it is hoped that more accurate cosmological measurements will further constrain parameters describing dark energy and eventually shed light on the underlying physical mechanism .",
    "dark energy is most simply described by its present day energy density relative to the critical value , @xmath4 , and its equation of state defined as the ratio of pressure to density , @xmath5 @xcite . in general , @xmath6 is allowed to freely vary with time ( or redshift ) , as is @xmath7 . in practice , it is difficult to constrain @xmath8 or , say , the scaled energy density @xmath9 , when they are described by more than a few parameters due to severe parameter degeneracies entering the observable quantity ( luminosity distance , in the case of sne ia ) .",
    "even though it is in principle possible to recover the function @xmath10 or @xmath8 directly from supernova measurements @xcite , in practice one has to fit the noisy data with a smooth functional form @xcite which introduces error and bias ( for a valiant attempt to do this with current data , see @xcite ) .",
    "another general approach is to model @xmath6 or @xmath11 using a cubic spline in redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) , but again the paucity of data limits the spline to a few points in redshift , while having more points would correlate the measurements making the interpretation somewhat difficult .",
    "constraints from the new sn ia data  @xcite suggest that dark energy is consistent with the cosmological constant scenario @xcite , agreeing with previous work @xcite .",
    "however , these ( and other ) analyses are typically based on particular models  either a linear variation with redshift @xcite or the evolution that asymptotes to a constant @xmath6 at high redshift @xcite , or perhaps a more complicated parameterization @xcite  that are used to describe redshift variation of the dark energy equation of state . while these forms do a very good job in fitting @xmath8 due to a variety of proposed mechanisms that could be responsible for dark energy @xcite",
    ", one should keep in mind that we are far from having any solid leads as to what to expect for the dark energy evolution .",
    "given the constant increase in the quality and quantity of sn ia data , it is timely to consider whether one can use current data to derive model independent conclusions on the evolution of dark energy .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a variant of the principal component analysis advocated in ref .",
    "we make use of the most recent type ia supernova data from ref .",
    "@xcite and present a view of dark energy complementary to other approaches . at the same time , we are seeking to answer one of the most important questions at present : is dark energy consistent with the cosmological constant scenario or not ?",
    "our analysis is facilitated by the fact that our measurements are completely uncorrelated .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on the applicability of this approach to future datasets . throughout",
    "we assume a flat universe .",
    "we would like to impose constraints on the parameters @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) that describe the dark energy equation of state @xmath8 or its energy density @xmath10 , each @xmath12 being suitably defined in the @xmath14 redshift bin .",
    "in addition to these , we have two more parameters : matter density relative to the critical @xmath15 and the hubble constant @xmath16(100km / s / mpc ) .",
    "we first marginalize the full @xmath17dimensional likelihood over these two ( for the priors and assumptions , see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) , and project them onto the @xmath12 space .",
    "the covariance of the @xmath18 resulting parameters is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the vector of parameters @xmath12 and @xmath21 its transpose .",
    "these parameters can now be rotated into a basis where they are diagonal by choosing an orthogonal matrix * w * so that it diagonalizes the fisher matrix @xmath22 where @xmath23 is diagonal .",
    "it is clear that the new parameters @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 , are uncorrelated , for they have the covariance matrix @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath24 are referred to as the principal components and the rows of @xmath27 are the window functions ( or weights ) that define how the principal components are related to the @xmath12 .",
    "we refer the reader to huterer & starkman @xcite for a discussion on the application of principal components to the dark energy equation of state .",
    "let us now define @xmath28 by absorbing the diagonal elements of @xmath29 into the corresponding rows of @xmath30 , so that @xmath31",
    ". then , as emphasized by hamilton and tegmark @xcite in the context of matter power spectrum measurements , there are infinitely many choices for the matrix @xmath28 , as for any orthogonal matrix @xmath32 , @xmath33 is also a valid choice that makes the parameters @xmath24 uncorrelated . while the principal components , @xmath24 , have several nice features  in particular , the best - determined @xmath24 are smoother and have support at lower redshift than the poorly determined ones  their corresponding window functions are oscillatory , making the intuitive interpretation of the components somewhat difficult .    here",
    "we advocate another choice for the weight matrix @xmath34 : the square root of the fisher matrix , @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "this choice is interesting since the weights ( rows of @xmath28 ) are almost everywhere positive , with very small negative contributions , and this has been recognized as a useful basis in which to represent measurements of the galaxy power spectrum from large - scale structure surveys @xcite .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 is computed by first diagonalizing the fisher ( inverse covariance ) matrix , @xmath36 , and then defining @xmath37 .",
    "we normalize @xmath28 so that its rows , the weights for @xmath12 , sum to unity . with this choice , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cov ] ) shows that the covariance of the new parameters , @xmath38 , is @xmath39 and parameters @xmath24 are manifestly uncorrelated .",
    "furthermore , their weights are mostly positive and are localized in redshift fairly well .",
    "we illustrate this in the next section using current supernova data .",
    "we perform the analysis of the `` gold '' dataset from riess et al .",
    "first , we need to parameterize @xmath8 and @xmath10 in redshift , thereby defining the parameters @xmath12 from sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "we choose @xmath8 to be piecewise constant in redshift and @xmath10 to be piecewise linear ( and continuous ) .",
    "these two assumptions are consistent , since the two functions are related as @xmath40 .",
    "note that , in the limit of the large number of parameters @xmath12 , the shape of the function across the redshift bin becomes irrelevant .",
    "we choose @xmath41 bins with redshifts @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , for both @xmath8 and @xmath10 constraints .",
    "while our choice of the number of parameters ( or bins ) is limited by the computing power required to perform the maximum likelihood analysis , we have repeated the same analysis with five parameters in each case and found consistent results .",
    "future sn ia data will lead to better constraints at all redshifts , requiring more parameters and perhaps the use of markov chain monte carlo techniques , but for our purpose a simple analysis is sufficient .",
    "furthermore , we have explored in detail the choice of the redshift binning , trying to strike a balance between band powers being narrow and having small error bars . not surprisingly , we find that the constraints on @xmath8 or @xmath10 are much better at low redshift , and we put three of our four bins there , choosing their widths so as to get comparable constraints in each . we have varied the exact spacing of the bins , and found results consistent with the same underlying @xmath8 or @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we describe the piecewise linear @xmath10 as follows : we write @xmath46 ( note that @xmath47 corresponds to the cosmological constant scenario ) .",
    "we describe @xmath48 by the sawtooth basis in redshift , where each tooth is @xmath49 wide and peaks in the middle of the corresponding bin .",
    "the highest - redshift bin presents a problem , since it is much wider than the others and implies that @xmath10 may be forced to vary strongly across this bin . to prevent this ,",
    "we make all basis vectors of the sawtooth 100% correlated in the highest redshift bin , essentially making @xmath10 flat across this bin .",
    "we have checked that these details do not affect the results appreciably by repeating the analysis with a few alternative choices , and we believe that these assumptions are reasonable and intuitive .",
    "the analysis is now straightforward : we compute the goodness - of - fit statistic @xmath50 for each model in the six - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "we allow a generous range for the parameters @xmath12 ( corresponding roughly to the vertical range in the left panels of the two figures ) and verify that changing the range leads to insignificant changes in the final constraints .",
    "we then marginalize the full likelihood over @xmath52 and all values of @xmath53 and project it onto the @xmath54 space .",
    "we use a flat prior @xmath55 , corresponding to the @xmath56 allowed range from the joint analysis of various cosmological probes @xcite .",
    "we have repeated our analysis with the gaussian prior @xmath57 and found that the results are largely insensitive to the exact choice of either prior : the only notable change was that the first band power increases by about 0.15 with the gaussian prior .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 are then rotated into the new parameters @xmath24 , which are now uncorrelated , following the methodology described in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the final 68% and 95% cl constraints on the four band powers ( i.e.  the parameters @xmath24 ) representing @xmath8 .",
    "we also show the weights that describe going from correlated parameters @xmath12 to the uncorrelated @xmath24 , as well as the full likelihoods of the four band powers .",
    "the horizontal error bars in the left panel show the extent of the original bins ; although the components weights extend across the whole redshift range , the most weight ( @xmath58% or more ) is in these respective bins and the band powers are therefore sufficiently localized in order to be easily interpreted .",
    "note also that the weights are mostly positive and have small negative contributions , as found in the context of matter power spectrum measurements  @xcite .    as shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "the equation of state is consistent with @xmath59 at the 95% cl in three out of four bins .",
    "we do find some ( @xmath60 cl ) evidence that @xmath61 at @xmath62 ; however , to confirm this result with certainty will require more data , and in particular more stringent control of the systematic errors . nevertheless , it is interesting that we find a similar tendency in the data as seen in completely independent analyses that use different , and less general , parameterizations @xcite . the present approach , however , is less model dependent than these methods . in particular , any variations in the equation of state on redshift scales",
    "smoother than the binning scale can in principle be detected ; more rapid oscillations can not .",
    "this is why we consider this approach to be _ nearly _ model independent  it would be truly model independent if we used a large number of bins , as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now consider another parameterization of dark energy ",
    "its energy density relative to the present value , @xmath10 .",
    "we repeat the analysis and obtain constraints on @xmath10 shown in fig .",
    "they are roughly consistent with those for @xmath6 , and are also consistent with the cosmological constant case at the 95% cl .",
    "note that the likelihoods are fully contained in the allowed ranges , and we see no evidence for negative @xmath10 .",
    "the weights of @xmath11 are somewhat less well localized ; however , the band powers are better determined than those of @xmath6 , as expected from the fact that @xmath11 is related to the luminosity distance data through a single , and not double , integral relation .",
    "we have used a variant of the principal component technique to produce uncorrelated , nearly model independent estimates of the equation of state of dark energy @xmath8 and its scaled energy density @xmath10 .",
    "we used four redshift bins in each case , and found results that are in good agreement with previous analyses .",
    "we further argued that the present approach nicely complements other methods that use conventional parameterizations of @xmath8 and @xmath10 . given that our band powers are uncorrelated",
    ", the interpretation of the cumulative evidence is particularly easy .",
    "if dark energy is due to the cosmological constant , then @xmath59 and @xmath63 , and all of our band powers should be consistent with those values , independently of their window functions .",
    "conversely , if we ever find strong statistical evidence that _ even just one _ band power is different from @xmath64 ( for @xmath6 ) or @xmath65 ( for @xmath11 ) , we will have ruled out the cosmological constant scenario .",
    "while we do find a hint of such evidence in the first band power of @xmath8 , a definitive analysis will have to await more data and a careful assesssment of the systematics .",
    "while we have presented an analysis with @xmath3 150 supernovae and restricted ourselves to four bins in redshift , the generality and power of this method should make it perfectly suitable for the analysis of future supernova datasets , when the error bars are expected to improve by up to an order of magnitude and enable a much more quantitative analysis and comparison with models . furthermore , the same techniques can be applied to a variety of other cosmological probes , as one can expect that their complementarity will considerably strengthen the sn ia results .",
    "finally , one can customize the proposed technique specifically to maximize the return of any given test ( say , whether @xmath66 or not ) . with an increase in the number of type ia supernovae at high redshift , it is likely that these interesting possibilities will be considered in the future .    _",
