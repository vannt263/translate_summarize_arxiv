    "game theory is the systematic study of decision - making in strategic situations .",
    "its models are widely used in economics , political science , biology and computer science to capture the behavior of individual participants in conflict and competition situations .",
    "the field attempts to describe how decision makers do and should interact within a well - defined system of rules to maximize their payoff .",
    "the kind of games we will be considering here is called minority games and arises in situations when a group of non communicating agents has to independently choose between two different choices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "payoff $ of one unit goes to those agents that makes the minority choice .",
    "if agents are evenly distributed between the two choices , everybody loses . in the classical case",
    ", the game has a mixed - strategy solution , where agents chooses randomly between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this yields an expected payoff @xmath5 which is given by the number of combinations that results in some player being in the minority group divided by the total number of possible combinations . for a four player game",
    "there are 16 possible combinations , with two minority states for each player .",
    "this gives an expected payoff < $ > of 1/8 to each .    generally a game is defined as a set @xmath6 , where @xmath0 denotes the number of players , @xmath7 the set of available strategies of player @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the payoffs of different game outcomes .",
    "for quantum games , we add the associated hilbert space @xmath10 , generally of dim @xmath11 , and the initial state @xmath12 . in a quantum game",
    ", the choice of strategy @xmath13 translates to choosing a unitary operator @xmath14 , which is applied locally on the qubit held by the player .",
    "the games will be analyzed with regard to two of the most important solution concepts in game theory is the nash equilibrium and pareto optimality .",
    "nash equilibrium is defined as the combination of strategies @xmath15 for which no player gains by unilaterally changing their strategy .",
    "pareto optimality occurs when no player can rise its payoff without lowering the payoff of others .",
    "following the scheme presented in @xcite , in the quantum version of the minority game , each player is provided with a qubit from an entangled set .",
    "strategy @xmath15 of player @xmath8 is played by doing a local unitary operation on the players own qubit , by applying its strategy operator @xmath16 su(2 ) .",
    "@xmath17 will be parameterized in the following way :      with @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the game starts out in an entangled initial state @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 where@xmath23 is usually taken to be a @xmath0 qubit ghz - state , from which each player is provided with one qubit [ 2][3 ] .",
    "the final state @xmath24 of the game becomes @xmath25 to calculate the expected payoff of player @xmath8 we take the trace of the final state @xmath24 multiplied with the projection operator @xmath26 of the player .",
    "the projection operator projects the final state onto the desired states of player @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath27 the sum is over all the @xmath28 different states @xmath29 , for which player @xmath8 is in the minority . for @xmath30",
    ", we have the following projection operator @xmath31 for player 1 .",
    "@xmath32 . in the 6-player game",
    ", each player has a sum of 12 such states .",
    "the expected payoff @xmath5 is finally given by : @xmath33.\\ ] ] the local unitary operations of the players eliminates the possibility for the system to end up in most states where nobody wins , and therefore yields higher than classical payoff .",
    "as a generalization of the broadly used ghz - state as the initial state @xmath34 we consider a superposition with products of symmetric bell pairs .",
    "a four qubit version of this state was used in a experimental implementation of a quantum minority game by c. schmid and a.p .",
    "flitney in @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 the parameter @xmath36 $ ] denotes the level of mixture .",
    "@xmath37 just gives back the ghz - state and @xmath38 product of the bell - pairs . to account for loss in fidelity in the creation of the initial state , we form a density matrix @xmath21 out of @xmath39 and add noise that can be controlled by the parameter @xmath40",
    "we get : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 identity matrix . by adjusting @xmath44 ,",
    "the initial state gets mixed with an even distribution of all basis states in @xmath45    for the ghz - state alone i.e @xmath37 and @xmath46 it has been shown that the nash equilibrium solution @xmath47 for the 4-player game is @xmath48 , and for the 6-player game , @xmath49 . for the state",
    "above , schmid and flitney showed that when starting with only the product of bell - pairs i.e @xmath38 , no advantage is achieved over the classical counterpart .",
