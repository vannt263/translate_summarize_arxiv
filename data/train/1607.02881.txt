    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are extragalactic off - nuclear point - like sources with luminosities exceeding the eddington limit for a 10 m@xmath7 black hole ( bh ) ( @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 ) @xcite . if the emission is isotropic , the compact object in some of the bright ulxs might be intermediate - mass black holes with masses @xmath11 10@xmath1210@xmath13 m@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "conversely , some ulxs might contain stellar - mass bhs and their high luminosities may arise from supercritical accretion @xcite .",

    "the nature of the ulx binary systems is still unclear .    studying the x - ray spectral states and state transitions of ulxs with the help of available multi - epoch data and comparing them with the well - known characteristics of galactic bh binaries ( bhb ) are essential tools to understand the radiation mechanisms of these sources .",
    "there are three active states that have been defined for galactic bhbs ; thermal , hard and steep power law . in thermal state ,",

    "the similar correlation between luminosity and photon index has been found in ulxs x-1 in ngc 1313 @xcite and x37.8 + 54 in m82 @xcite . although there are some ulxs that exhibit opposite behaviour ( ngc 1313 x-2 , @xcite ; ngc 4736 x-2 , @xcite ) .",

    "also , xm3 data seems better fitted with diskbb .",
    "but for the remaining datasets , the spectra of the source yielded relatively better fits with pl .",
    "the analyses revealed that x-6 generally has a hard spectrum ( @xmath39 1.8@xmath52.1 ) .",
    "however , the spectrum becomes somewhat softer in xm5 data with a steeper photon index of @xmath40 and a lower inner temperature of t@xmath41 kev as derived from pl and diskbb models , respectively .",
    "the calculated flux of x-6 between 0.3 to 10 kev is not constant throughout the observations .",

    "statistically , addition of a disk component did not improve the fit significantly .",
    "the energy spectra of some ulxs may show curvature above 2 kev which is expected from the optically thick corona @xcite .",
    "therefore , to search spectral curvature , we fitted the spectra of x-6 in xm6 and xm7 data with broken pl model .",
    "the modelling gave the best - fit break energies as @xmath112.9 and 3.6 kev , respectively .",
    "however , according to f@xmath5test , the improvement of the fits over the pl model were @xmath44 .",
    "a possible iron line was seen in the spectrum of the source in xm6 data .",
    "the observation of iron line emission in some ulx spectra could be interpreted to be in its high state @xcite .",
    "this line was fitted with an additional gaussian line component to the pl model ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the best - fit model parameters for the gaussian line were @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "we carried out two tests to check whether the line is associated with the ulx .",
    "for the first one , a combined spectrum was obtained by stacking all the pn data of all _ xmm - newton _ data to increase signal - to - noise ratio around 7 kev .",
    "the line is not significantly detected in the combined spectrum .",
    "this is consistent with the possibility that the line emission appears only at certain epochs . for the second one",
    ", an image was obtained from pn data that was filtered between 6.6@xmath57.5 kev to see whether those few line photons are centered on the position of the source or are spuriously contaminating the source region .",
    "the photons seem to center on the source .",
    "these results suggest that the iron line ( if real ) is a variable phenomenon associated with the ulx and not with diffuse emission from gas in the host galaxy .    additionally , we tried to fit the spectra of x-6 with absorbed diskpbb model ( also known as @xmath47-free disk or extended disk blackbody ) to interpret the difference between standard disk and slim disk .",
    "disk temperature has a radial dependence as t(r ) @xmath48 r@xmath49 , where @xmath47 is a free parameter .",
    "when @xmath50 the standard disk model is obtained and if @xmath51 then radial advection becomes important .",
    "the spectral parameters for each observation are given in table 4 .",
    "the spectra of x-6 is well modelled with @xmath47-free model with a @xmath47 parameter that is indicative of a non  standard disk ( @xmath110.5 ) except for c1 data where the model indicated a @xmath47 parameter consistent with a standard disk .",
    "however , we note that the fit statistics is not good enough to distinguish models . additionally in xm1 , xm2 , xm4 and xm5 data the calculated inner disk temperatures ( t@xmath52 ) were @xmath53 3 kev .",
    "therefore , we fixed the inner disk temperatures to the averaged value ( @xmath11 1.70 kev ) while fitting these data ( see table 4 ) .",
    "we also calculated bolometric luminosity integrating the diskbb model fluxes between 0.01@xmath5100 kev energy range to obtain l@xmath54t@xmath52 plot ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "the calculated luminosity values are given in column 9 of table 4 .",
    "the plot was fitted with a power - law relation and a l@xmath55 t@xmath56 was found with a correlation coefficient of @xmath110.8 , instead of l@xmath55 t@xmath57 .",
    "this relation is expected from an optically thick standard accretion disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems rather difficult to interpret the emission of ulx x-6 as result of a standard disk .",
    "we could not perform spectral fits to the _ swift _ data , since the spectral quality was not good enough . however , the maximum 2@xmath2 limit on the flux was calculated using the longest _ swift _ data ( s1 ) as 3@xmath58 erg @xmath37 s@xmath1 by fixing the parameters to the best pl parameters of xm7 data .",

    "three distinct sources were detected by psf photometry .",
    "hence , we have analysed these three sources as possible optical counterparts of x-6 .",

    "this task was used for photometry on the images by taking the f435w drizzled image as the positional reference .",

    "@xcite derived the extragalactic extinction for ngc 4258 in the range of @xmath169 mag using 69 cepheids .",
    "the mean extinction obtained from a few cepheids close to the region around the ulx is @xmath170 mag .",

    "however , the light curves from the _ swift _ data do not show significant variation and indicate a rather persistent behaviour ( see figure 3b ) .",
    "most notably in xm5 data , it has the lowest hr value .",
    "the source has a steeper pl photon index ( @xmath211 ) and the lowest inner disk temperature ( t@xmath212 ) in this epoch .",
    "if we assume the source emits at the eddington limit in xm6 data ( in which spectrum gives the highest l@xmath213 erg s@xmath1 ) the mass of the compact object in this system is found as @xmath214 .",
    "the luminosity of x-6 changes a factor @xmath112 during these variations .",

    "the luminosities are usually lower in the hard state , higher in the thermal ( soft ) state and switches to a very high value in the spl state . however , there are some galactic bhbs and ulxs that do not show similar behaviour ( e.g. xte j1550 - 564 , @xcite ; ngc 1313 x-2 , @xcite ; ic 342 x-1 , @xcite ; ngc 4736 x-2 , @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account that the ulxs are different than usual galactic bhbs , they might harbour stellar - mass bh with supercritical accretion disk ( scad ) @xcite similar to grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "in scad scenario the disk is excepted to be slim ( @xmath215 ) within a spherization radius ( r@xmath216 ) and the radial dependence of the temperature is expected to be r@xmath217 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath47 parameters were found consistent with slim disc model with one exception ( c1 data , @xmath218 0.75 ) .",
    "this may be due to the decrease in the flux of x-6 in c1 data .",
    "the inner disk temperatures obtained from diskpbb fits are consistent with the model @xcite and similar to some other ulxs ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible to constrain the mass of the compact object using the disk models ( diskbb and diskpbb ) parameters . for this calculations",
    ", we used the technique described by @xcite .",
    "since the spectrum of x-6 is relatively better modelled with diskbb model in xm3 data , the diskbb normalization parameter obtained using that observation were adopted for this calculation .",
    "we found an apparent inner disk radius of @xmath219 km .",
    "the apparent radius were corrected to true value using @xmath220 equation , where the correction factor @xmath221 and @xmath222 is spectral hardening factor ( see @xcite ) .",

    ", we may calculate another mass value for the compact object .",
    "we derived a true inner disk radius of @xmath227 km using the correction factor @xmath228 and a spectral hardening factor @xmath229 3 @xcite . assuming a moderate disk inclination @xmath224 and taking the mass correction factor as minimum ( @xmath11 1.2 ) the mass of the compact object in x-6 can be calculated as @xmath226 for a nonspining bh .",
    "this value is consistent with the estimation in the paragraph above .",
    "three optical counterpart candidates were identified after the astrometric correction .",
    "we calculated the x - ray to optical flux ratios for three sources .",
    "this ratio is given as log(f@xmath230/f@xmath231)@xmath18logf@xmath230",
    "@xmath232 m@xmath231/2.5 @xmath232 5.37 where m@xmath231 is the extinction corrected visual magnitude and f@xmath230 is the unabsorbed x - ray flux in the 0.3@xmath53.5 kev energy band @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous x - ray and optical observations are not available for x-6 .",
    "therefore we calculated log(f@xmath230/f@xmath231 ) using the minimum ( xm5 ) and maximum ( xm6 ) f@xmath230 values adopted from pl model parameters .",
    "for source 2 , log(f@xmath230/f@xmath231 ) was found to be 1.5@xmath51.8 .",
    "although these values are within the given ratios for the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( @xmath51 to 1.7 , @xcite ) , they are acceptable values also for a high mass x - ray binary . for source 1 and 3 , the ratios were found to be 2.2@xmath52.5 and 2.0@xmath52.3 , respectively .",
    "these ratios are greater than values of agn , normal stars , normal galaxies and bl lac objects @xcite and are similar to the optical counterparts of other ulxs @xcite .    colors and absolute magnitudes of these sources were obtained ( see table 5 ) .",
    "these sources have m@xmath231 values that are consistent with the optical counterparts of ulxs in table 4 of @xcite that range from @xmath57 @xmath94 m@xmath231 @xmath94 @xmath53 .",
    "assuming the optical emission of x-6 is dominated by the companion star and using the schmidt - kaler table ( @xcite ) intrinsic colors , the probable spectral type of source 1 , 2 and 3 can be estimated between b2@xmath5a3 , b6@xmath5a5 and b0@xmath5a7 supergiants , respectively .",
    "we also found that the counterpart candidates of x-6 possibly belong to a star cluster using the _ hst_/acs / wfc images . after obtaining cmds for the stars in the cluster and using the padova isochrones , the age of source 1 , 2 and 3",
    "have been estimated in the range 15@xmath530 , 12@xmath514 and 6@xmath525 myr , respectively .",
    "the mass of the counterpart candidates are estimated from the parsec isochrones by taking into account their ages and absolute magnitudes as 9@xmath513 m@xmath7 for source 1 , 14@xmath516 m@xmath7 for source 2 and 10@xmath525 m@xmath7 for source 3 .",
    "the mass range of candidates are compatible with the donor stars of other ulxs @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the optical emission could also arise from the accretion disk .",
    "when the disk is dominant , this emission is expected to vary significantly as most of the ulxs , e.g. m101 ulx-1 ( @xcite ) . if the optical variability of the counterpart candidate is taken into account , source 1 is a promising candidate in the present case , disk contribution can not be ignored .",
    "therefore , both the donor star and the accretion disk may give comparable contribution to the optical emission of x-6 .    in summary",
    ", even though the source does not exhibit x - ray spectral variations similar to the galactic bhbs , there are some spectral changes both in hardness ratios and spectral model parameters . nonetheless , it is hard to say anything conclusively about the accretion regime .",
    "additional x - ray data with better statistical quality can constrain the physical parameters better shedding more light in to the origin of the x - ray emission from x-6 .",
    "both broadband photometric and high resolution spectroscopic observations will help to distinguish the optical counterpart and find out the origin of the optical emission .",
