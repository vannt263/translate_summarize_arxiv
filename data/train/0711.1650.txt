    "the recent synthesis of stricty two - dimensional atomic crystals of carbon ( monolayers of graphite  graphene ) @xcite is promising a wealth of new phenomena and applications in technology .",
    "the observation of anomalous transport properties , and , most exciting , the discovery of substantial field effect and magnetism at room temperature allows one to envisage graphene as a reasonable replacement of nanotubes in electronic applications @xcite .    in the case of isolated graphene",
    ", the electronic states near the fermi level can be described in a simple manner @xcite . by symmetry , the lower and upper bands touch at the corners of the hexagonal brillouin zone . in the vicinity of these points ,",
    "the dispersion relation is isotropic and linear , and the density of states at the fermi level is strictly zero . using the tight - binding approximation for the nearest neighbour interaction in the honeycomb lattice",
    ", an effective long - wavelength description of electronic states in graphene can be written in terms of a continuum model which is based on the dirac ",
    "weyl equation for massless electrons in 2 + 1-dimensional space - time with the role of speed of light @xmath0 played by fermi velocity @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the one - particle hamiltonian operator of the model takes the form @xmath2 where the @xmath3 matrices can be chosen in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the one - particle electronic wave function possesses 4 components : @xmath6 where subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 correspond to two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice and subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to two inequivalent fermi points .",
    "the linear dispersion law , @xmath11 , results in the density of states @xmath12 which is the density of states of two - dimensional ultrarelativistic fermi gas ( here @xmath13 is the area of the graphene sample ) .",
    "consequently , the thermal average charge of electronic excitations in graphene , @xmath14 is evidently zero , because eq.(4 ) is even in energy ( @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "topological defects in graphene are disclinations in the honeycomb lattice , resulting from the substitution of a hexagon by , say , a pentagon or a heptagon ; such a disclination rolls up the graphitic sheet into a cone .",
    "more generally , a hexagon is substituted by a polygon with @xmath16 sides , where @xmath17 is an integer which is smaller than 6 .",
    "polygons with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) induce locally positive ( negative ) curvature , whereas the graphitic sheet is flat away from the defect , as is the conical surface away from the apex . in the case of nanocones with @xmath18 ,",
    "the value of @xmath17 counts the number of sectors of the value of @xmath20 which are removed from the graphitic sheet .",
    "if @xmath19 , then @xmath21 counts the number of such sectors which are inserted into the graphene sheet . certainly , polygonal defects with @xmath22 and @xmath23 are mathematical abstractions , as are cones with a pointlike apex . in reality , the defects are smoothed , and @xmath18 counts the number of the pentagonal defects which are tightly clustered producing a conical shape ; such nanocones were observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "theory predicts also an infinite series of the saddle - like nanocones with @xmath21 counting the number of the heptagonal defects which are clustered in their central regions .",
    "saddle - like cones serve as an element which is necessary for joining parts of carbon nanotubes of differing radii and for creating schwarzite @xcite , a structure appearing in many forms of carbon nanofoam @xcite . as it was shown by using molecular - dynamics simulations @xcite , in the case of @xmath24 , a surface with a polygonal defect",
    "is more stable than a similarly shaped surface containing a multiple number of heptagons ; a screw dislocation can be presented as the @xmath25 limit of a @xmath16-gonal defect .    in the present paper",
    "we shall consider the influence of topological defects in graphene on its electronic properties at finite temperature .",
    "the effects of the variation of the bond length or the mixing of @xmath26- with @xmath27-orbitals caused by curvature of the lattice surface are neglected , and our consideration , focusing on global aspects of coordination of carbon atoms , is based on the long - wavelength continuum model originating in the tight - binding approximation for the nearest neighbour interactions .",
    "we employ a general theory of planar relativistic fermionic systems in the singular vortex background @xcite ; its version for the case of massless fermions was elaborated in @xcite .",

    "all radial components behave asymptotically at large distances as outgoing waves , i.e. as @xmath47 at @xmath48 and as @xmath49 at @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and a physical sheet for the square root is chosen as @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) . in the cases of @xmath54 all radial components are regular at small distances , i.e. at @xmath55 and at @xmath56 . in all other cases",
    "there are radial components that are irregular at @xmath57 and @xmath58 for some values of @xmath59 .",
    "this is related to the fact that in these cases hamiltonian ( 16 ) is not essentially self - adjoint and is characterized by the nonzero deficiency index . according to the weyl ",
    "von neumann theory of self - adjoint operators ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , a procedure of the self - adjoint extension is implemented yielding the condition for the irregular radial components , which depends on the set of self - adjoint extension parameters .",
    "it should be emphasized that only irregular radial components can produce a piece in the density of states , which is odd in energy .",
    "thus , if charge ( 5 ) is nonvanishing , then it depends on the set of self - adjoint extension parameters .",
    "let us consider the possibility of charge generation in the cases of @xmath60 , when hamiltonian ( 16 ) is characterized by deficiency index @xmath61 , and there is only one self - adjoint extension parameter ",

    "we get the expression for the piece of the density of states , which is odd in energy : @xmath80 @xmath81 where the summation over @xmath82 is performed .",
    "although quantity ( 25 ) is negligible as compared to the ideal gas contribution ( 4 ) , lacking the factor of the sample area , it provides the generation of nonzero charge on some graphitic nanocones .",
    "substituting ( 25 ) into ( 5 ) , we get the thermal average of charge , @xmath83 taking into account relation ( 24 ) , one can present thermal average ( 5 ) in the form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the contour consisting of two collinear straight lines , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , in the complex @xmath46-plane . by deforming contour @xmath85 to encircle poles of the hyperbolic tangential function on the imaginary axis , one gets @xmath88 where @xmath89 . using ( 23 ) and summing over @xmath90 , we get @xmath91^{2f}{\\rm tan}\\left(\\frac \\theta 2 + \\frac \\pi",

    "watson transform of the infinite sum representation ( 29 ) .",
    "thus , the charge is zero for graphitic nanocones with @xmath92 , since in these cases one has @xmath93 , see ( 21 ) .",
    "note that one has : @xmath94 for @xmath95 , @xmath96 for @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the charge , if any , for the one - pentagon ( @xmath95 ) defect is of opposite sign to that for the one - heptagon ( @xmath97 ) defect and is of the same sign to that for the three - heptagon ( @xmath99 ) defect .    in the high - temperature limit",
    "@xmath100 the charge tends to zero as inverse power of temperature : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the riemann zeta function ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . in the zero - temperature limit the charge tends to finite value @xcite : @xmath103,\\ ] ] where @xmath104 thus , there is a remarkable equation relating the ground state charges which are induced by the one - pentagon , one - heptagon and three - heptagon defects : @xmath105 as it is shown in @xcite , the induced ground state charge is accumulated around a defect .",
    "this suggests that the same happens for the temperature - induced charge as well , and the local density of states is modified in essential way in the vicinity of a defect .",
    "we conclude that the theory predicts the dependence of the induced charge on the self - adjoint extension parameter in the cases of graphitic nanocones with one pentagon , one heptagon and three heptagons at the apex .",
    "this is due to the fact that the density of electronic states attains an additional piece which is odd in energy , see ( 25 ) . actually , there are three possibilities : @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 .",
    "the question of which of the possibilities is realized has to be answered by future experimental measurements .",
