    "we let @xmath399 where @xmath400 are both continuous non - negative functions on @xmath395 .",

    "the key difference is that @xmath395 includes some geodesics ( i.e. @xmath468 ) sharing one ideal endpoint with @xmath34 , and @xmath444 extends continuously to these points , giving @xmath469 .      if @xmath473 then @xmath474 by the definition of @xmath79 .",
