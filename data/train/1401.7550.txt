    "a large number of observational data  @xcite supports that the post - inflationary universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic and that the expansion of the universe is accelerating .",
    "it was also shown that the universe is spatially flat at large distances .",
    "there are two possible ways of describing the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "the assumption that general relativity is the correct theory of gravity leads to the conclusion that there exists and currently dominates a smoothly distributed , slowly varying cosmic fluid with negative pressure , so - called dark energy  @xcite . the simplest way to describe",
    "the dark energy is to add the cosmological constant to the einstein ",
    "hilbert action .",
    "another popular variant is to consider models with scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "there are a few reason to consider cosmological models with scalar fields .",
    "first of all there is no doubt that the evolution of the universe can be described by the spatially flat friedmann  lematre  robertson ",
    "walker ( flrw ) background and cosmological perturbations .",
    "models with scalar fields are very useful to describe such a type of the evolution .",
    "that is why scalar fields play an essential role in modern cosmology , in particular , in the current description of the evolution of the universe at the early epoch  @xcite .    to specify",
    "the cosmic fluid one typically uses a phenomenological relation @xmath0 between the pressure ( lagrangian density ) @xmath1 and the energy density @xmath2 of this fluid .",
    "if a model includes only one cosmic fluid then in the flrw metric the equation of state parameter @xmath3 and the hubble parameter @xmath4 are connected as follows : @xmath5 where differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath6 is denoted by a dot .",
    "the cosmological constant corresponds to a constant @xmath4 ( de sitter universe ) .",
    "the standard way to obtain an evolving hubble parameter is to add scalar fields to a cosmological model .",
    "it has been demonstrated that dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter provides a compelling alternative to a cosmological constant if data are analysed in a prior - free manner and the weak energy condition is not imposed by hand  @xcite . for the model with minimally coupled scalar with the standard kinetic term",
    "we get @xmath7 and the hubble parameter is a monotonically decreasing function .",
    "to get non - monotonic behaviour of the hubble parameter one needs either to add a phantom scalar field and get a quintom model  @xcite , or consider a scalar field with the second - derivative lagrangian ( see  @xcite as a review ) .",
    "note that the dark energy equation of state parameter can be less than @xmath8 , since this possibility is not excluded by astrophysical data  @xcite . at the same time",
    "the cosmological models with @xmath9 violate the null energy condition ( nec ) , this violation is generally related to the phantom fields appearing .",
    "the standard quantization of these models leads to instability , which is physically unacceptable .",
    "examples of cosmological models with nonstandard scalar fields that admit solutions violating the nec and having no obvious pathologies are presented  in  @xcite .",
    "note that consideration of models with phantom scalar fields can be motivated by the string field theory  @xcite .",
    "the theory with @xmath9 can be interpreted as an approximation in the framework of the fundamental theory .",
    "because the fundamental theory must be stable and must admit quantization , this instability can be considered an artefact of the approximation . in the flrw",
    "metric the nec violating models can have classically stable solutions cosmology . in particular , there are classically stable solutions for self - interacting ghost models with minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "moreover , there exists an attractor behavior in a class of the phantom cosmological models  @xcite .",
    "alternative way to describe the dark energy is to modify the theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "some of popular modified gravity models , for example , @xmath10 gravity models , can then be mapped into general relativity models with additional scalar fields by a suitable conformal transformation of the metric ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "another example is a class of nonlocally modified gravity models which were proposed to explain the current phase of cosmic acceleration without dark energy  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and the review  @xcite ) .",
    "these models do not assume the existence of a new dimensional parameter in the action and include a function @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the dalembertian operator .",
    "these nonlocal models have a local scalar - tensor formulation that has been proposed in  @xcite , developed and used in  @xcite .",
    "predictions of simplest inflationary models are in disagreement with the planck2013 results  @xcite . at the same time",
    "many of these inflationary scenarios can be improved by adding a tiny non - minimal coupling of the inflaton field to gravity  @xcite . in the last years ,",
    "the higgs - driven inflation that includes non - minimal coupling between the higgs boson and gravity has attracted a lot of attention  @xcite .",
    "the models with the ricci scalar multiplied by a function of the scalar field are being intensively studied in cosmology  @xcite ( see also  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "generally these models are described by the following action : @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are differentiable functions of the scalar field @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath18 and the signature @xmath19 is used .    the reconstruction procedure for the induced gravity models ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a constant ) has been proposed in  @xcite . in such a case",
    "it has been shown that one can linearize all the differential equations that should be solved in the reconstruction procedure to get the potential corresponding to a given cosmological evolution .",
    "this property allows one to obtain the explicit forms of potentials reproducing the dynamics of a spatially flat flrw universe , driven by barotropic perfect fluids , by a chaplygin gas and by a modified chaplygin gas  @xcite .    in  @xcite another reconstruction procedure for the models described by action",
    "( [ action ] ) has been considered .",
    "such a method is similar to the hamilton ",
    "jacobi method ( also known as the superpotential method or the first - order formalism ) and is applied to cosmological models with scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "note that similar method is used for the reconstruction procedure in brane models  @xcite and in holographic models @xcite .",
    "the key point in this method is that the hubble parameter is considered as a function of the scalar field @xmath16 .",
    "these two methods described above supplement each other and together allow one to construct different cosmological models with some required properties .",
    "in this paper we study the stability of solutions in the flrw metric , considering isotropic and homogenous fluctuations only .",
    "in other word , we assume that not only background solution , but also perturbations are homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "we analyse the stability with respect to small fluctuations of the initial data .",
    "in  @xcite , induced gravity models with the sixth degree polynomial potentials and physically interesting behaviors of the hubble parameter have been obtained . to get these models",
    "the superpotential method has been used , because the explicit form of the hubble parameter @xmath22 is too complicated to be guessed . in particular , solutions with non - monotonic behaviors of the hubble parameter",
    "have been obtained . in this paper",
    "we consider the stability of these solutions .",
    "the stability of a continuous solution tending to a fixed point ( kink or lump like solutions ) implies the stability of this fixed point .",
    "this fixed point is a de sitter solution if the corresponding hubble parameter is not equal to zero .",
    "de sitter solutions which are attractors of the system describing the cosmological dynamics of non - minimally coupled scalar field have been investigated in  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we use the lyapunov theorem  @xcite and find conditions under which the fixed point and the corresponding kink ( or lump ) solution are stable . in these cases",
    "the necessary condition of exact solution s stability is boundedness of the first corrections for positive time semiaxis . in particular",
    "we find conditions under which solutions this nonmonotonic behaviour of the hubble parameter are stable .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 , we review the basic equations for a induced gravity model and remind the algorithm of the superpotential reconstruction procedure . in section  3",
