    "dwarf irregular ( dirr ) galaxies are commonly assumed to be `` simple '' systems . compared with more massive star - forming galaxies , such low - mass dwarfs",
    "lack bulk sources of energy that can `` trigger '' star formation ( e.g. , spiral density waves , rotational shear ) .",
    "rather , dirrs are often observed undergoing solid - body rotation ( see discussion in skillman 1996 and numerous recent examples ; e.g. , begum etal .",
    "this implies that star formation ( sf ) proceeds largely in situ , with turbulence and stellar evolution being important dynamical processes .",
    "this deceiving simplicity raises an important unanswered question in galaxy evolution : how do relatively isolated , low - mass systems sustain sf for extended periods of time ?",
    "recent resolved stellar population work has shown that dwarf galaxies can host remarkably long episodes of heightened sf activity .",
    "the durations of these bursts of sf are commonly defined by a modified birthrate parameter , _ b _ @xmath3 sfr/@xmath4sfr@xmath5 ; @xcite sets a threshold of _ b_@xmath62 as a `` starburst '' . using this metric ,",
    "burst durations of order 100 myr , and extending to @xmath61 gyr in some cases , have been derived for nearby dwarfs ( weisz etal .",
    "2008 ; mcquinn etal .",
    "2009 , 2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "further , these works have shown that relatively young stars ( @xmath7100 myr ) can occupy a large fraction of the surface area of the galaxy : the sf events can , at times , pervade the entire disk .",
    "these points serve as pertinent reminders that the commonly - used instantaneous sf tracers ( e.g. , h@xmath8  emission ) are only a small piece of a much larger , temporally extended , puzzle ( see , e.g. , the detailed discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the current and past sf traced by these spatially resolved stellar population studies naturally leads to mechanical energy input into the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the form of supernovae ( sne ) and stellar winds ( hereafter collectively referred to as `` feedback '' ) . while dwarf galaxies have small potential wells ( dynamical masses are typically of order 10@xmath910@xmath10 m@xmath11",
    "; e.g. , mateo 1998 ) , simulations suggest that it is difficult to eject material from low - mass galaxies completely .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that only systems with gas masses @xmath710@xmath9 m@xmath11  are susceptible to large - scale mass loss from mechanical feedback .",
    "multi - phase outflows of gas that apparently remain bound to the systems , however , are predicted theoretically ( see references above ) and verified observationally ( e.g. , heckman etal.2001 ; martin etal .",
    "2002 ; cannon etal .  2004",
    "; young etal.2007 ; kobulnicky & skillman 2008 ) .    a parallel question to that posed above is what mechanism(s ) , if any , serve(s ) to regulate the ongoing sf in dwarfs ?",
    "what properties are found in systems that have hosted a previous burst but now are comparatively quiescent ? while such `` post - starburst '' galaxies are not as well - studied as systems hosting ongoing bursts ( see , for example , the sample presented in lee etal .  2009 ) , they offer a unique opprtunity to study the stellar and gaseous components of systems after vigorous sf episodes have terminated .",
    "what halts or slows the sf in these systems ? if they are sufficiently massive to maintain most or all of their gaseous component during a sf event , then the cessation of sf can not be caused by complete `` blowaway '' of the galaxies available fuel .",
    "one decidedly simplistic potential solution is that mechanical `` feedback '' slowly but cumulatively increases the velocity dispersion and turbulence of the neutral gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this can heat and distribute the gas over a sufficiently large volume to slow or halt sf . after this energy dissipates in the ism",
    ", the neutral gas will eventually begin to move downward in the potential well of the galaxy . sf",
    "would then re - ignite in jeans - unstable regions . in this simplistic scenario",
    ", one would expect localized regions of sf to impact their surroundings as the massive stars contained within undergo the stellar life cycle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some dwarf galaxies show abundant evidence for this sf - ism interaction .",
    "the ism of the m81 group dwarf ic2574 is littered with holes , shells and depressions @xcite ; some of these are associated with remnant stellar clusters within ( e.g. , stewart & walter 2000 ; cannon etal .",
    "2005 ) , and some are not .",
    "further , some of these kinematic features directly correlate with both high column density neutral gas and with high surface brightness nebular emission .",
    "recent spatially resolved work has shown that sf is energetically and temporally capable of creating the `` super giant shell '' structure , and of igniting subsequent sf around the shell rim @xcite .",
    "similarly , in the m81 group dirr galaxy holmbergii , temporally extended sf was found to be energetically capable of creating the numerous holes in the ism ( weisz etal .",
    "2009b ; see also puche etal .",
    "1992 and rhode etal .",
    "1999 ) . taken together",
    ", these results suggest that concentrated sf ( i.e. , `` bursts '' ) and subsequent stellar evolution can ( but do not always ) lead to the formation of prominent structures in the ism of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the scenarios discussed above raise another question that is important for understanding the evolution of dwarf galaxies : over what timescales do we expect to find correlations between intense sf , high column density neutral gas ( i.e. , the `` schmidt '' law ; kennicutt 1989 , 1998 ) , and the `` canonical '' sf tracers ( e.g. , h@xmath8  emission ) ?",
    "numerous works have shown that current sf correlates well with emission in various wavebands ( e.g. , uv , optical and infrared , or combinations thereof ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , we do not yet know if similar correlations hold true for sf intensity 100 myr ago , 200 myr ago , and so on .",
    "the aforementioned stellar population studies , combined with multiwavelength imaging , provide an opportunity to address this important issue .    in the present work we discuss these science themes as applied to the intriguing dwarf galaxy ddo165 ( a.k.a .",
    "ugc 8201 ) .",
    "located on the far side of the m81 group at a distance of 4.47@xmath120.20 mpc ( using the magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this relatively isolated system ( tidal index @xmath13 @xmath3 0.0 ; karachentsev etal .",
    "2004 ) has drawn attention due to its peculiar properties . a sharp boundary or cutoff of stars",
    "distinguishes the galaxy s optical appearance . @xcite and",
    "the _ whisp _ survey @xcite noted that the h  ikinematics were highly disturbed .",
    "a member of the _ sings _ sample @xcite , the metal abundance in the ism of ddo165 is sub - solar ( @xmath013% z@xmath11 ; see walter etal.2007 , croxall etal .",
    "this , in part , contributes to the very weak mid- and far - infrared emission ( see images in walter etal .  2007 ) ; @xcite do not estimate a dust mass based on the marginal detections at 70 and 160 @xmath14 m using _ spitzer _ imaging .",
    "the narrowband studies by lee etal .",
    "( 2007 , 2009 ) , and the stellar population work by @xcite , have identified ddo165 as being in a post - starburst state .",
    "the latter study provided sf intensities as a function of time throughout the galaxy back to @xmath01 gyr , and a global average value over the hubble time .",
    "this lifetime average star formation rate ( sfr ) was found to be a relatively quiescent @xmath00.013 m@xmath11yr@xmath1 ; however , over the last 1 gyr , ddo165 has formed 17% of its total stellar population .",
    "further , during this last gyr , the sfr was significantly elevated above the lifetime average ( that is , the galaxy was `` bursting '' ; see mcquinn etal .",
    "2010b ) . around 25 myr",
    "ago , however , the global sfr plummeted to the current low level ; weak h@xmath8  emission ( see further discussion below ) verifies this dramatic reduction in current massive sfr .",
    "given these intriguing properties , we wish to ascertain what effects the recent ( @xmath0500 myr ago to present ) sf has had on the ism of ddo165 .",
    "further , we seek clues as to what mechanism(s ) have contributed to the decreasing recent sfr . to this end , we present new h  i  spectral line imaging of this system , and compare these rich data with optical ground- and space - based imaging . we have discovered a wealth of morphological and kinematic structure in the ism of ddo165 ; we discuss these features in detail in this work .",
    "a companion paper uses spatially resolved stellar population analyses to quantitatively study the stellar - ism interaction over the last 500 myr in ddo165 ; there we find that sf has occurred throughout the entire disk over this interval .",
    "ddo165 ( see basic parameters in table  [ t1 ] ) was observed with the nrao very large array ( vla ) in the h  i  spectral line for program ac842 ( pi cannon ) . to be sensitive to h  i  emission on various scales ,",
    "observations were acquired in the b , c , and d configurations ( see discussion in walter etal .",
    "the vla was being upgraded to the _ evla _ during this program ; we thus used a set frequency to acquire all data ( i.e. , doppler tracking was not applied ) .",
    "the on - source integration times were approximately 6.5 hr in the b array , 3 hr in the c array , and 1.5 hr in the d array .",
    "a bandwidth of 1.56 mhz was used over 128 channels , resulting in a velocity resolution of 2.58 kms@xmath1  after online hanning smoothing .",
    "table  [ t2 ] shows the observational parameters for each of the observation sessions .",
    "the primary calibrator 1331@xmath15305 ( 3c286 ) was used for flux calibration ; the secondary calibrator was 1313@xmath15675 , with a flux density of 2.40 jy .",
    "we reduced the data from each observation separately using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) package .",
    "first , the data were inspected and bad data points removed .",
    "flux , gain , and phase calibrations were then applied .",
    "all three data sets were then combined and imaged .",
    "line emission was prominent between @xmath1620 kms@xmath1  and @xmath1580 kms@xmath1 .",
    "the task imagr in aips was used to clean to 2.5 times the rms noise level .",
    "this task was conducted twice , once to create a naturally weighted data cube with an output beam size of 12.5  @xmath17 11.3  ( @xmath18 @xmath3 0.59 mjybm@xmath1 ) and a second time to create a robust weighted cube ( robust = 0.5 ; briggs 1995 ) with an output beam size of 7.5  @xmath17 5.9  ( @xmath18 @xmath3 0.67 mjybm@xmath1 ) .",
    "we convolved these cubes to four different circular beam sizes : 20  @xmath17 20  and 15  @xmath17 15  from the naturally weighted cube , and 10  @xmath17 10  and 7.5  @xmath17 7.5  from the robust weighted cube .",
    "we explicitly account for the different beam sizes of the dirty and clean maps using residual flux scaling ( e.g. , jrster & van moorsel 1995 ; walter etal .",
    "2007 ) .    to differentiate noise from real emission ,",
    "the naturally weighted 20  cube was spatially smoothed and then blanked at the 2@xmath18 level .",
    "after blanking , the cube was further inspected by hand .",
    "emission was classified as real when it appeared in three or more consecutive channels .",
    "this master blanked cube was then used to blank all cubes , ensuring that the same regions contribute at each resolution .",
    "using the blanked cubes , h  i  surface brightness , velocity field , and velocity dispersion maps were created using the task xmom in aips .",
    "observations of ddo165 were obtained with the bok 2.3 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) on may 29 , 2001 .",

    "the data were processed by the standard _ hst _ pipeline .",
    "the v and i band photometry was presented in @xcite ; the integration times were 9536 seconds in each filter .",
    "the treatment of the _ hst _ data are discussed in detail in paper ii .",
    "h  i  emission from ddo165 is detected in the velocity range @xmath1620 to @xmath1580 kms@xmath1 .",
    "figure  [ figcap1 ] presents the individual channel maps from the 20  @xmath17 20  datacube .",
    "the curious nature of the h  i  in ddo165 , which was previously noted by @xcite and @xcite , is immediately evident in this figure .",
    "if solid - body rotation were present ( as is typical for dirrs ; skillman 1996 ) , it would appear as a smooth change in the position of neutral gas as a function of velocity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "ordered rotation is decidedly absent in ddo165 .",
    "the channel maps reveal two main components of the h  i  gas . moving upward from negative velocities ,",
    "there is emission in nearly all channels from the `` southern '' h  i  component , which contains two column density peaks on the east and west sides of the system ( consider , for example , the panel at 21.5 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the `` northern '' h  i  component appears between @xmath0 24 to 58 kms@xmath1 .",
    "these two features surround a large cavity in the center of the h  i  distribution .",
    "this h  i  hole is especially evident between radial velocities of @xmath050 to 25 kms@xmath1 .",
    "we discuss this `` hole '' in detail below .",
    "the h  i  flux from each channel of the 20  @xmath17 20datacube is plotted as a function of velocity in the global profile presented in figure  [ figcap2 ] .",
    "the profile is approximately gaussian , although the higher velocity side contains significantly more flux than the lower velocity side ; it is very similar in shape to the single - dish profile shown in @xcite .",
    "the departures from symmetry are suggestive of the presence of multiple h  icomponents ( see discussion above ) ; our kinematic analysis verifies this interpretation ( see   [ s4 ] ) .",
    "the systemic velocity , v@xmath22 @xmath3 ( 29@xmath122 ) kms@xmath1 , is found from the velocity at full width half maximum of this global profile ; at the adopted distance of 4.47@xmath120.20 mpc @xcite , this low systemic velocity implies a significant peculiar motion within the m81 group .",
    "the total h  i  flux integral was derived from the 20  cube , yielding s@xmath23 = 23.2@xmath122 jykms@xmath1 .",
    "this is 18% lower than the single dish flux integral of 28.2 jy kms@xmath1  found by @xcite using effelsberg 100 m observations .",
    "we note that our maximum single - channel flux density of 550@xmath1250 mjy is in fair agreement with the corresponding maximum value from @xcite of 601@xmath1211 mjy .",
    "as discussed above , we applied residual flux scaling in the imaging process , and thus the small difference between these global flux integrals is most likely due to the lack of very short baselines in our interferometric observations , and our corresponding insensitivity to diffuse , extended neutral gas .",
    "the total detected h  i  mass is ( 1.1@xmath120.3)@xmath1710@xmath24 m@xmath11 .",
    "figures  [ figcap3 ] and [ figcap4 ] show moment zero ( representing h  i  surface density ) , moment one ( representing intensity - weighted velocity field ) , and moment two ( representing velocity dispersion ) images at 20  and 10  resolution , respectively . the h  i  column density peaks in three regions in ddo165 ; the two largest peaks ( n@xmath23 @xmath252@xmath1710@xmath26 @xmath21 ) are associated with the southern component of the system , which comprises @xmath085% of the total h  i  mass .",
    "the northern component reaches a maximum column density of n@xmath23 @xmath251.1@xmath1710@xmath26 .",
    "low column density gas connects the northern and southern features , primarily in the western section of the disk .",
    "we estimate the mass of the northern component to be ( 1.6@xmath120.4)@xmath1710@xmath9 m@xmath11 .",
    "a central h  i  depression is very prominent in the moment zero images .",
    "the physical diameter of this feature is @xmath02.2@xmath171.1 kpc ( see further discussion below ) , making this one of the largest such known in a dwarf galaxy .",
    "we hereafter refer to this feature as the central h  i  hole .",
    "the size and morphology is reminiscent of the central holes in several well - studied systems ( e.g. , m81dwa , sargent etal .  1983 ; sextansa , skillman etal .  1988 ; holmbergi , ott etal .",
    "note that there is only very low column density neutral gas in the northeast region of the galaxy . in that regard ,",
    "the central hole can be considered incomplete , as it is not surrounded by higher column density gas around the entire circumference .    as expected from the channel maps ( see figure  [ figcap1 ] ) , the representations of the velocity field of ddo165 shown in figures  [ figcap3 ] and [ figcap4 ] are very complex and highly disturbed . there is evidence for rotation of the southern component , although the axis of rotation is position dependent . in the southeast region ,",
    "the isovelocity contours suggest rotation on a position angle of @xmath0310 ; however , the central region of the southern component appears to be rotating more or less east - west .",
    "the northern component shows weak evidence for rotation at a third position angle ( @xmath00 ) .",
    "the velocity field of ddo165 is highly irregular compared to most dwarf galaxies of comparable mass ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we explore the velocity field further in   [ s4 ] .",
    "we attempted a tilted ring analysis of these velocity fields using the gipsy task rotcur .",
    "we experimented with numerous iterations of the fit parameters , including dynamical center position , inclination , and rotation position angle . since rotcur assumes a symmetric velocity distribution for its input , it is perhaps not surprising that our fits did not identify a unique set of parameters to describe the complex velocity field of ddo165",
    "the primary difficulty is in identifying a unique dynamical center position ; holding other parameters constant , we were able to derive a convergent solution for essentially any central position . in a final attempt to attain a successful solution , we convolved the velocity field to low resolution ( 1 ) , but were again unable to derive an unambiguous rotation curve",
    ".    previous analysis of the h  i  kinematics by @xcite identified similar difficulties in fitting the h  i  velocity field .",
    "the position angle of the maximum velocity gradient from that work was found to be ( 130@xmath1210 ) , on a line from southeast to northwest ( equivalent to [ 310@xmath1210 ] measured east of north ) . in our tilted ring analysis",
    ", we identify the same position angle for the largest coherent velocity gradient .",
    "we again stress that a unique rotation curve was not identified , but nonetheless use this position angle in the position - velocity ( pv ) analysis presented in   [ s4.1 ] .",
    "we note that no unique optical position angle is listed in the catalog of principal galaxies @xcite or the sloan digitized sky survey @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion images shown in figures  [ figcap3 ] and [ figcap4 ] reveal interesting characteristics of the h  ikinematics .",
    "the southern component has a higher average velocity dispersion ( @xmath012 kms@xmath1 ) than the northern component ( @xmath08 kms@xmath1 ) ; the difference is larger than the velocity resolution of the data ( 2.56 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the @xmath012 kms@xmath1  average in the southern component is slightly larger than the characteristic @xmath27 values found for three _ things _ dwarf galaxies in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the characteristic @xmath27 value for the northern component is in good agreement with that average .",
    "note that @xmath27 is elevated to values larger than 20 kms@xmath1  in the center of the southern component .",
    "this region of increased velocity dispersion is located between the two column density peaks .",
    "it is coincident with the position at which the isovelocity contours show significant changes in direction ( see also discussion above ) . taken as a whole , these interesting characteristics of the h  i  morphology and dynamics prompted a detailed investigation of the small - scale gas motions within ddo165 ; we discuss the results of those analyses in   [ s4 ] .      in figure  [ figcap5 ] , we compare the neutral gas distribution with optical observations .",
    "figures  [ figcap5](a ) and ( b ) show the same moment zero image as figure  [ figcap3 ] .",

    "it is interesting to note that each of these systems is a well - studied , `` canonical '' dwarf starburst galaxy , typically with multi - phase outflows and high equivalent width h@xmath8emission from ongoing sf .",

    "finally , while the ism is clearly highly disturbed ( see also the discussion in   [ s4.1.2 ] below ) , recent simulations have shown that most of the energy from turbulence is contained on scales of a few hundred pc or less @xcite ; it is unlikely that turbulence could be capable of remaining coherent over kpc scales or of injecting sufficient energy to cause bulk motion of the @xmath010@xmath9 m@xmath11  of neutral gas associated with the northern h  i  component .",

    "the spatially resolved pv slices through the 20  datacube reveal a remarkable wealth of localized , high - velocity neutral gas features in the disk of ddo165 .",
    "these features are spatially compact but extended in velocity space ; such features have been observed in a few starbursting dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , ngc625 - cannon etal .",

    "there , slices 9 through 11 sample the center of the southern h  i  component before traversing the giant h  i  hole .",
    "while the velocity extent of these h  i  features is slightly smaller than the southeast features discussed above , they still span more than @xmath040 kms@xmath1 , from @xmath0@xmath1610 kms@xmath1  through @xmath030 kms@xmath1 . continuing westward along the southern component , slices 13 through 15 pass through the main h  i  column density peak and its associated active sf region",
    ". the @xmath040 kms@xmath1  velocity extent of the neutral gas is again seen in the southern component . finally , moving from slice 16 through slice 18 , the material in the western disk",
    "is also extended in velocity space .",
    "these localized features span up to @xmath050 kms@xmath1 , from @xmath020 kms@xmath1  through @xmath070 kms@xmath1  ( see especially slice 17 ) .",
    "the physical conditions of the gas in the southern and northern components appear to be quite different .",
    "most of the gas in the southern component is extended in velocity space ( confirming the elevated velocity dispersion discussed in   [ s3.1 ] ) .",
    "however , all slices through the northern h  i  component ( slices 9 through 14 in the major - axis pv diagrams shown in figures  [ figcap8 ] and [ figcap10 ] , and slices 13 though 18 in the minor - axis pv diagrams shown in figures  [ figcap9 ] and [ figcap11 ] ) show it to be comparatively compact in velocity space , spanning @xmath020 - 25 kms@xmath1   along both axes .",
    "the information in these spatially resolved pv diagrams , and in the velocity dispersion images discussed above , highlight a factor of @xmath02 difference in velocity extent of localized gas features between the northern and southern h  i  components .",
    "recall by examining figures  [ figcap5 ] and [ figcap6 ] that the southern h  i  region contains the two largest h  i  column density maxima , the most luminous h@xmath8  emission source , and a much higher stellar density than the northern region .",
    "these high velocity gas features suggest that dynamical effects , either localized due to feedback from recent sf or globally due to an interaction , are having a dramatic impact on the neutral gas in the southern region of ddo165 .",
    "we quantitatively interpret the nature of these high velocity features in the context of the feedback model in paper  ii .      as discussed in ",
    "[ s1 ] , feedback from massive star evolution can directly shape the surrounding ism .",
    "the post - starburst characteristics , disrupted velocity field , and extended velocity features in the neutral ism of ddo165 suggest that this feedback mechanism could be especially efficient at creating ism structures . in a simplistic case",
    ", one would expect multiple holes and shells in the neutral gas if the past sf has created coherent structures via energy deposition in stellar winds and/or sne , and if those structures had not yet been erased by either dynamical processes or by the re - establishment of pressure equilibrium with the surrounding multi - phase ism .",
    "we thus undertook a search for such structures in both pv space and radius - velocity ( rv ) space .",
    "we use the kpvslice and kshell tools in the karma visualization software package , as well as gipsy / sliceview . note that each type of analysis has certain advantages , but",
    "the primary gain in moving from pv to rv space is the increased signal - to - noise ratio as one averages over more pixels than in a pv slice .    in this kinematic exploration , we characterize potential coherent structures using the formalism described by @xcite .",
    "h  iholes and shells are classified into three groups . in a type  1 hole ,",
    "h  i  gas has been completely evacuated from a particular region , and no signature of expansion is apparent in either pv or rv space . in a type  2 feature ,",
    "one side of the hole has broken out of the plane of the galaxy , while the other side retains a shell structure .",
    "these type  2 structures are perhaps the most difficult to identify ; in pv space they appear as broken ellipses ( see also the numerical simulations of these structures discussed by silich etal.1996 ) .",
    "finally , a type  3 hole represents a complete , expanding shell that is easily identified in rv space as an unbroken half - ellipse or in pv space as a complete ellipse .",
    "type  3 holes provide the most kinematic information , as both a diameter and an expansion velocity are directly measurable in rv space .",
    "we searched for these types of structures in both the naturally weighted cubes ( 15  and 20 , sensitive to large - scale holes and shells ) and in the robust weighted cubes ( 7.5  and 10 , sensitive to smaller holes and shells ) .",
    "we examined pv cuts across the entire system ( see discussion above and figures  [ figcap10 ] and [ figcap11 ] ) and on smaller scales and at arbitrary position angles .",
    "we also examined rv diagrams with a minimum radius of the beam size throughout the galaxy .",
    "we identified 8 holes and shells in the neutral ism of ddo165 in this analysis ; the locations and properties of these holes are listed in table  [ t4 ] in order of increasing central right ascension position .",
    "their positions , sizes , and orientations are shown overlaid on the 20  h  i  column density image and velocity field in figure  [ figcap12 ] .",
    "forunately , 6 of these 8 structures fall within the _ hst _ field of view ; as figure  [ figcap13 ] shows , holes # 3 and # 8 have no detailed stellar population information available .",
    "the most easily identifiable structure is the giant h  i  hole ( identified as # 6 in table  [ t4 ] and in figures  [ figcap12 ] and [ figcap13 ] ) .",
    "this appears as an obvious evacuated cavity in surface density maps and in the spatially resolved pv cuts ( see discussion in   [ s4.1.1 ] ) .",
    "a pv cut through hole # 6 is shown in figure  [ figcap14 ] ; note the evacuated nature of the hole .",
    "rv analysis of this structure shows no expansion signature , and we thus classify this structure as a type  1 hole . note that the major axis of the hole is aligned with the major axis used to create the pv slices shown in figures  [ figcap10 ] and [ figcap11 ] .",
    "as figure  [ figcap13 ] shows , this hole occupies a significant fraction of the entire galaxy , measuring 2.2@xmath171.1 kpc in diameter .",
    "the stellar density within the hole is non - uniform , with areas of higher density in the southeast and west , and sampling the transition into the halo in the north .",
    "we identify two other type  1 holes in the neutral ism of ddo165 .",
    "hole # 4 appears as a slight under - density in the h  i  column density map ( see figure  [ figcap12 ] ) .",
    "it is located well south of the characteristic stellar `` cutoff '' in the southern region of the galaxy ( see figure  [ figcap13 ] ) .",
    "it is the smallest structure that we detect with confidence and is only resolved in the robust - weighted datacubes .",
    "hole # 1 is a highly elliptical feature ( nearly 1 kpc in length but only @xmath0400 pc wide ) located in the northwest region of the system .",
    "the stellar density is somewhat lower than that within hole # 6 .",
    "we identify five type  3 holes in our analysis ; holes # 2 and # 3 are apparent in both pv and rv space , while holes # 5 , # 7 , and # 8 are only found in the rv plane .",
    "holes # 2 and # 8 share similar characteristics ; both are located on the edge of a large h  i  column density maximum ( but offset from the regions of high h@xmath8equivalent width ) .",
    "figure  [ figcap13 ] shows an apparent over - density of stars near the center of hole # 2 ; hole # 8 falls outside of the _ hst _ field of view .",
    "hole # 3 is located in the outer disk in a region of comparatively low h  i  surface density ; it is the largest expanding structure that we identify in this analysis .",
    "holes # 5 and # 7 are located in similar regions , immediately to the south of the main stellar disk , just overlapping the transition region to high surface densities ( see figure  [ figcap13 ] ) .",
    "both structures are coincident with some of the high velocity h  i  features identified in   [ s4.1.2 ] . as an example of the clarity of the expansion signal in the rv plane",
    ", we show in figure  [ figcap15 ] an rv diagram of hole # 5 ; note the closed half - ellipse structure .",
    "the diameter of the structure is estimated to be 17 , and the minimum velocity is estimated to be @xmath07 kms@xmath1 .",
    "we estimate the errors on these measurements to be at the @xmath030% level .    the five structures with kinematic information span a range of physical sizes ( from @xmath0400 pc to @xmath0900 pc ) and measured expansion velocities ( 7 kms@xmath1  to 11 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "we stress that coherent neutral gas structures can elude our detection methods in three ways .",
    "first , expanding structures may have expansion velocities below our 2-channel velocity resolution limit ( 5.12 kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "second , the structures can be smaller than our reliable physical resolution limit ( @xmath0165 pc from the 7.5  datacube ) .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , the expansion signature can be taking place out of our line of sight .",
    "we speculate that this effect may in part explain the lack of type  2 holes recovered by our analysis .",
    "a region of significant interest is the northern h  i  component ; recall the kinematic discontinuity between this region and the southern h  i  component ( see discussion in   [ s4.1.1 ] ) .",
    "the northern h  i  component harbors a visually identified stellar association and ongoing sf ( see figures  [ figcap6 ] and [ figcap7 ] ) .",
    "we searched for signatures of expansion caused by localized feedback from this sf , but none were found .",
    "the separation of the northern and southern h  i  components , both physically and in velocity space , is apparently not the result of feedback from recent sf in the northern region alone .",
    "we consider this issue in more detail in paper  ii .",
    "note that we do not detect holes or shells directly associated with either of the h@xmath8-bright sf regions in the main disk ( compare figures  [ figcap13 ] and [ figcap5 ] ) .",
    "while these sf regions are coincident with high velocity gas features ( see discussion in   [ s4.1.2 ] ) , the recent ( @xmath710 myr ) feedback from massive stars has not produced coherent h  i  structures large enough to be prominent at our resolution limit .",
    "we postulate that in these regions , the mechanical energy from sf has increased the local velocity dispersion of the gas , producing incoherent gas motions that are extended in velocity space but that are not identifiable as coherent h  i  holes or shells .",
    "the coherent h  i  structures that show evidence for expansion offer an opportunity to derive the amount of energy needed to create the structure .",
    "the basic approach is to adopt the observed expansion velocity as the constant , past expansion velocity .",
    "one then uses the physical radius of the structure to infer a kinematic age , and an estimate of the mass of gas within it ( i.e. , assuming a volume density of neutral hydrogen ) to derive the amount of energy needed to evacuate the region .",
    "this energy may originate from sne and stellar winds , and may be tied fundamentally to the recent sf patterns in a given region of a galaxy .",
    "many past investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have adopted this formalism to infer the energetics of holes and shells in external galaxies .",
    "most applications of this formalism use the single - blast model of @xcite . here",
    ", the energy of an expanding h  i  shell is given by    @xmath30    where e@xmath31 is the energy needed to create the expanding structure in ergs , n@xmath32 is the h  i  volume density ( for our calculations we assume n@xmath32=0.1 @xmath33 , an appropriate average value for the outer disks of dwarf galaxies and for ddo165 ; see detailed discussion in paper  ii ) , d is the diameter of the shell in parsecs , and v@xmath34 is the observed expansion velocity in kms@xmath1 .",
    "this simplistic model has well - known difficulties ; some of the most pronounced include the unknown conversion efficiency of sne energy into gas momentum ( assumed to be 100% in a direct application of equation  [ eq1 ] ) , the explicit values of hydrogen volume density as a function of position , the shape and depth of the gravitational potential well prior to the creation of the hole , among many others .",
    "we stress that the above estimate is uncertain at the 50% level or more ; however , it is used frequently in the literature and we thus include its application here for ease of comparison with previous works . following weisz etal .",
    "( 2009b ) and references therein , we revise some of the assumptions above to attempt a more accurate calculation of the h  i  hole energetics in paper  ii .    for the type  3 holes identified in ddo165",
    ", we list in table  [ t4 ] their kinematic ages in myr and the energetic requirements derived using equation  [ eq1 ] .",
    "these energies can be compared to the canonical energy output of a type  ii sn explosion , @xmath010@xmath35 erg @xcite .",
    "one can thus infer the number of massive stars required to create a given hole .",
    "we note that the energies derived in table  4 are uncertain due to the assumption of a constant expansion velocity .",
    "the kinematic ages range from @xmath02050 myr , while the energy requirements are in the @xmath010@xmath3510@xmath36 erg range .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the creation energies derived in previous studies of h  i  holes in dwarf galaxies ( see , e.g. , walter & brinks 1999 , weisz etal .  2009b , and references therein ) .",
    "taken at face value , these modest energy requirements suggest that the creation of coherent h  i  holes and shells can be accomplished by modest numbers of massive stars . however , the small number of detected holes , and the extended recent sf throughout ddo165 ( see weisz etal .",
    "2008 ) , cloud this simplistic interpretation and provide the motivation for the comparison of h  i  and stellar energetics that is the focus of paper  ii .",
    "the lack of coherently expanding neutral gas structures associated with the h@xmath8-luminous regions in ddo165 can be explained by three possible scenarios .",
    "first , the timescale for the creation of coherent h  i  structures from small numbers of massive stars could be longer than the characteristic timescale for h@xmath8  emission ( 10 myr ) .",
    "second , the ongoing sf in ddo165 , concentrated in the h@xmath8-luminous regions , could be too weak to create such structures at all ; the efficiency of individual sne at accelerating natal neutral gas could be very low .",
    "third , if that efficiency is low , then the creation of such structures might require sf that is extended temporally in order to inject the requisite amounts of energy .",
    "evidence is mounting that these long burst episodes are important in the ism of dwarf galaxies .",
    "elevated sfrs have been measured to span hundreds of myr , much longer than the instantaneous sf traced by ionizing photons ( mcquinn etal .",
    "2009 , 2010a , 2010b ) .",
    "these temporally extended sf episodes have been shown to be energetically capable of creating the h  i  holes observed in nearby galaxies ( weisz etal .  2009a , 2009b ) .",
    "taken together , these lines of evidence suggest that it is not surprising that the holes and shells we observe in ddo165 are in fact not associated with the currently most massive stars .    while the expanding holes in ddo165 provide important kinematic information , the type  1 holes are equally intriguing .",
    "we again draw attention to hole # 6 , the giant structure that spans a @xmath02.2@xmath171.1 kpc region offset from the center of the stellar body .",
    "this structure has been nearly completely evacuated of neutral gas ( n@xmath23 @xmath410@xmath28 @xmath21 at 10  resolution ) ; given the number of young stars located within the hole ( see paper  ii for details ) , it is logical to conclude that whatever mechanism conspired to evacuate it did so during or after the formation of this interior stellar population .",
    "we note that the blue stellar density distribution presented in @xcite contains a significant number of stars in both the southern h  i  component and in the area now covered by the giant h  i  hole .",
    "while the estimates of the requisite energetics are difficult in the absence of kinematic information , we nonetheless explore the connection between recent sf and this giant h  i  structure in more detail in paper  ii .",
    "we have presented new vla multi - configuration h  i  21  cm spectral line observations of the intriguing post - starburst dwarf irregular galaxy ddo 165 .",
    "the neutral gas morphology and dynamics are quite complex for an apparently isolated low - mass system .",
    "the two major h  icomponents appear to be kinematically distinct .",
    "the southern h  icomponent contains the bulk of the neutral gas mass ( @xmath085% or 9.4@xmath1710@xmath9 m@xmath11 ) and is spatially coincident with the regions of highest stellar density and with the characteristic `` cutoff '' of the stellar population in the southern disk .",
    "two column density peaks in this southern h  i  component are spatially coincident with the highest surface brightness h@xmath8  emission .",
    "the northern component also harbors dense gas and ongoing sf .",
    "the h  i  morphology is dominated by a giant evacuated hole that spans @xmath02.2@xmath171.1 kpc .",
    "this feature is offset from the region of highest stellar density , but still contains a significant portion of the entire stellar population of the ddo165 system .",
    "in addition to this visually obvious h  i  hole , we find seven other hole or shell features via pv or rv analysis .",
    "five of these features have kinematic information ( i.e. , measured expansion velocities ) , while the other three ( including the aforementioned giant h  i  hole ) are currently static in the h  i  spectral line .",
    "a coarse estimate of the requisite energetics is performed using the oft - cited single - blast , kinematic age model @xcite ; paper  ii presents a more sophisticated derivation of the energetic requirements of the h  i  holes based on a mass model derived from infrared imaging .",
    "a spatially resolved pv analysis shows multiple high velocity gas features along the southern h  i  component , spatially coincident with the truncated stellar population .",
    "these localized features span an average velocity range of @xmath040 kms@xmath1 , with some features reaching @xmath060 kms@xmath1 .",
    "these features are interpreted as the localized effects of stellar feedback that have created incoherent motion of the surrounding h  i  gas ; this hypothesis is explored in detail in paper  ii .",
    "this interpretation is strengthened by the results of the spatially resolved sf history analyses of ddo165 presented in @xcite and in mcquinn etal .",
    "( 2010a , 2010b ) ; the past sf was extended over hundreds of myr , and we postulate that feedback from this sf has produced the highly disturbed h  i  dynamics of the system .    using the kinematic information in our h  i  datacubes , we can reject certain models for the origin of the two kinematically distinct h  icomponents .",
    "specifically , scenarios involving turbulence , counter - rotating or superposed disks , and coherent global rotation each fail to reproduce the kinematic signatures in our data .",

    "<S> the bulk of the neutral gas is associated with the southern section of the galaxy ; a secondary peak in the north contains @xmath015% of the total h  i  mass . </S>",
    "<S> these components appear to be kinematically distinct , suggesting that either tidal processes or large - scale blowout have recently shaped the ism of ddo165 . using spatially - resolved position - velocity maps </S>",
    "<S> , we find multiple localized high - velocity gas features . </S>",
    "<S> cross - correlating with radius - velocity analyses , we identify eight shell / hole structures in the ism with a range of sizes ( @xmath0400900 pc ) and expansion velocities ( @xmath0711 km s@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these structures are compared with narrow- and broad - band imaging from _ kpno _ and _ hst_. using the latter data , recent works have shown that ddo 165 s previous `` burst '' phase was extended temporally ( @xmath21 gyr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus interpret the high - velocity gas features , h  i  holes , and kinematically distinct components of the galaxy in the context of the immediate effects of `` feedback '' from recent star formation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to creating h  i  holes and shells , extended star formation events are capable of creating localized high velocity motion of the surrounding interstellar material . </S>",
