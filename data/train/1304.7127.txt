    "most of existing data on neutrino oscillations from the solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite experiments have established a framework of neutrino oscillations among three flavor neutrinos mixed with three mass eigenstates .",
    "these sets of eigenstates are related through a @xmath0 unitary matrix , called the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix  @xcite which is commonly parameterized by three angle , @xmath1 , and a cp - violating phase , @xmath2 . the oscillation parameters from the global fits of the current neutrino oscillation data with 1 @xmath3 uncertainity have been determined as @xmath4 and @xmath5 for normal hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "cp violation phases are unknown .",
    "on the other hand , there exist a few experimental results , at the level of anomalies ( i.e. with a significance around 2 - 4 @xmath3 ) , that can not be explained in the standard three flavour picture .",
    "the first anomaly is coming from the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "they studied the transitions @xmath6 with a baseline of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 ( @xmath9 mev ) is the neutrino energy and @xmath10 ( @xmath9 m ) is the distance between source and detector .",
    "they reported a @xmath11 excess of about 3.8 @xmath3 above the expected background including standard three flavour neutrino oscilations ( `` lsnd anomaly '' ) .",
    "this excess requires @xmath6 oscillations with @xmath12 in the range from 0.2 2 to 2 2 .",
    "if neutrino oscillations are responsible , a solution might require additional , sterile , neutrino species which do not couple to the z boson .",
    "the miniboone experiment  @xcite was designed to examine the lsnd parameter space at the same baseline @xmath13 by studying @xmath14 and @xmath6 transitions . from combined analysis of both channels ,",
    "an excess of 3.8 @xmath3 in the range @xmath15 mev have been observed ( `` miniboone anomaly '' ) . by interpreting the data in terms of neutrino oscillations , the extracted parameter values are consistent with the ones coming from lsnd .",
    "re - evaluation of the neutrino flux emitted by nuclear reactors @xcite has been increased by @xmath16 .",
    "based on the new flux calculation , the results of previous short - baseline ( @xmath17  m ) reactor experiments show a @xmath18 deficit ( about @xmath193 @xmath3 effect ) in the measured @xmath11 flux . this deficit can be explained by assuming @xmath20 disappearance due to oscillations with @xmath21  ev@xmath22 ( `` reactor anomaly '' ) .    an additional anomaly was raised from radioactive source experiments at the gallium solar neutrino experiments sage  @xcite and gallex  @xcite .",
    "they have obtained an event rate induced by @xmath23 fluxes produced by intense @xmath24cr and @xmath25ar sources which is lower of about @xmath26 than expected .",
    "this effect can be explained by the hypothesis of @xmath27 disappearance due to oscillations with @xmath28  ev@xmath22  @xcite ( `` gallium anomaly '' ) .",
    "these anomalies in neutrino oscillation data can be explained by a hypothetical fourth neutrino separated from the three standard neutrinos by a squared mass difference of few 2 .",
    "furthermore , analysis of cosmological data  @xcite such as cosmic microwave background , big bang nucleosynthesis allows one extra sterile neutrino .",
    "therefore we would conclude that these studies are becoming one of the most important topics to be addressed in neutrino physics .",
    "a large number of experiments will be coming up with the aim of investigating their possible presence with a variety of methods and approaches  @xcite",
    ".    one of them is the icarus - nessie experiment ( spsc - p-347 )  @xcite .",
    "it is a joint proposal for the search of sterile neutrinos with a short - baseline neutrino beam based at cern . in the following",
    ", the new short - baseline neutrino beam facility at cern and the nessie detector concept , as well as the physics reach of the experiment , will be discussed .",
    "the detail on icarus lar - tpc detector and techniques have been discussed elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "a new short - baseline neutrino beam facility , cenf  @xcite , was proposed in the cern north area , shown in figure  [ fig : cenf ] , in order to study anomalies mentioned above .",
    "it will consist of an sps fast extraction system and a new proton transfer line to bring high energy protons to the target area .",
    "the primary target will be followed by a decay tunnel terminated by a beam dump .",
    "11  m underground ; decay pipe : 110  m , 3  m diameter ; beam dump : 15  m of fe with graphite core , followed by muon stations ; neutrino beam angle : pointing upwards ; at @xmath193 m in the far detector @xmath195  mrad slope.,width=453,height=188 ]    the neutrino beam will be produced by accelerating protons of 100 gev / c by the cern super synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "these protons will be ejected towards a graphite neutrino production target in two extractions , separated in time by 50 ms .",
    "each sps cycle length will be 3.6 s long .",
    "secondary particles , mainly charged pions and kaons , will be focused by magnetic horns and decay in flight into neutrino in 110 m long hellium filled decay tunnel of about 3 m diameter .",
    "neutrino(antineutrino ) beam with a peak energy around 2 gev , will travel through the identical detectors located in `` near '' and `` far '' detector site , 450 m and 1600 m , respectively .",
    "the proton beam intensity of @xmath29 pot / year is expected . at the appropriate oscillation path l / e@xmath30",
    ", the experiment is going to undoubtedly shed more light on the @xmath31 window for expected anomalies .",
    "the nessie near and far detectors , as shown in figure  [ fig : detector ] , will be placed just downstream of icarus lar - tpc detector , in order to measure with high precision the charge and the momentum of muons produced by neutrino interactions in the lar target and those interacting in the spectrometer itself .",
    "the nessie detector will consist of an air - core magnet ( acm ) followed by an iron - core magnet ( icm ) .",
    "the icm is dedicated to the precise reconstruction of high - energy muons ( up to 30 gev ) and to reach few @xmath32 precision , through range measurement , on the momentum of muons with energy lower than 4 gev .",
    "the acm covers the low momentum region where it ensures high momentum resolution and charge discrimination ( allowing to separately study the @xmath33 and @xmath34 component ) .",
    "the dipolar icm spectrometers are instrumented with vertical iron plates ( 210 slabs with a total of 800 tons for the near , 294 iron slabs with a total of 1500 tons for the far detector ) interleaved with detector layers composed by resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) for a total of 700 m@xmath22 and 12000 digital channels in the near and 1800 m@xmath22 and 20000 digital channels in the far sites .",
    "rpcs provide the tracking inside the magnet with 1 cm resolution and range measurement for stopping muons .",
    "the typical values of the magnetic field is about 1.5 t. most of the detectors from the opera spectrometers  @xcite might be recovered and re - used .",
    "the possibility of reusing the iron slabs of the opera spectrometers is under study , too .",
    "the acm is instead a new design , using 51 ( 39 ) coils 9 meters long in the straight parts and two half circular bending regions for the return of the conductors outside the beam region in the far ( near ) site . aluminium material have been chosen both for the conducting cables and the supporting structure .",
    "all coils are connected electrically and hydraulically in series .",
    "planes of high precision tracker ( hpt ) will be placed in the acm in order to provide tracking with 1 mm resolution .",
    "the total mass of the acm is about 6 tons .",
    "the magnetic field in acm can reach 0.1 t using a dedicated power supply .",
    "and the fringe field outside the magnet is below the constraints imposed by the lar electronics , as shown in figure  [ fig : fringe ] .",
    "both icm and acm are going to provide a charge misidentification probability as low as 1% over a momentum range from 0.1 to 10 gev , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fringe ] .",
    "assuming the @xmath35 around 2 2 and @xmath29 pots for 1 year of operation , either with negative or positive polarity beam , the expected cc interaction rates in the lar - tpcs at the near ( effective 119 t ) and far locations ( effective 476 t ) , and the expected rates of fully reconstructed events in the nessie spectrometers at the near ( effective 241 t ) and far locations ( effective 661 t ) , with and without lar contribution are shown in table  [ tab : rates ] . the spectrometer will be able to correctly identify about 40% of all the cc events produced in , and escaped from the lar - tpc s , both in the near and far sites .",
    "therefore complete measurement of the cc event spectra will be possible , along with the nc / cc event ratio in synergy with the lar - tpc and the relative background systematics .",
    ".the expected rates of interaction ( lar ) and reconstructed ( nessie ) events 1 year of operation .",
    "values for @xmath36 around 2 ev@xmath22 are reported as example . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     on the top of that a high number of cc events will be produced in the spectrometers .",
    "this will also allow to study the nc / cc ratio in an extended energy range , and to perform an independent measure of @xmath37  disappearance    the shapes of the radial and energy spectra of the neutrino beam component , in the far and near locations , are practically identical . in the absence of oscillations , all cross sections and experimental biases cancel out , and two experimentally observed event distributions must be identical .",
    "any emerged difference of the event distributions at the locations of the two detector might be attributed to the possible existence of neutrino oscillation due to additional sterile neutrinos .",
    "the difference of the expected spectra for the measured cc muon events for non - oscillation and with the oscillation hypothesis , for both neutrino and antineutrino exposure , are shown in figure  [ fig : rates ] , for the `` nessie alone '' detection .",
    "the @xmath38 disappearance signal is well studied by the nessie spectrometers , with large statistics and by disentangling @xmath38 from @xmath39  @xcite . as an example",
    ", figure  [ fig : limits ] shows the sensitivity plot ( at @xmath40 c.l . ) for two years negative - focusing ( neutrino ) plus one year positive focusing ( antineutrino ) . a large extension of the present limits for @xmath38 by cdhs  @xcite and the recent sciboone+miniboone  @xcite will be achievable in the sin@xmath41 , and @xmath35 space .     from ccfr  @xcite , cdhs  @xcite and sciboone+miniboone  @xcite experiments",

    ", scaledwidth=55.0% ]    the physics reach on electron neutrino oscillation both in appearance and disappearance mode in icarus - nessie experiment can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the icarus - nessie experiment will explore in a definitive way a region of parameter space completely covering the possible anomaly claimed by lsnd and a large fraction of the region relevant to the reactor anomalies .",
    "looking for the muon neutrino cc and nc disappearance as well as the electron neutrino oscillation both in appearance and disappearance modes will allow disentangling the different possible couplings to sterile neutrinos and cover all possible light sterile neutrino signatures for masses up to a few 2 .",
    "the measurements of the neutrino flux at the near detector in the full muon momentum range is relevant to keep the systematic errors at the lowest possible values .",
    "moreover , the measurement of the muon charge will enable to separate @xmath37 from @xmath42 which is very important since the @xmath37 contamination is large in antineutrino beam mode .",
    "this will also allow to fully exploit the experimental capability of observing any difference between @xmath14 and @xmath43 ( cp violation signature ) .",
