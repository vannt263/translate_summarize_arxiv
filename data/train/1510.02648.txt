    "novel optical , electronic , magnetic and conductive properties appear in materials when structures are formed with sizes comparable to the nanometer scale , dominated by quantum confinement of the electron wavefunction .",
    "the paramagnetic silver clusters with unpaired electrons were expected to be chemically and catalytically active @xcite . among others ,",
    "the paramagnetic six - atom cluster exhibited more activities against nitrogen monoxide than other silver clusters @xcite .",
    "our electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) studies suggested that the adsorbed no is on a previously diamagnetic and therefore a magnetically silent silver cluster .",
    "furthermore , electron spin echo envelope modulation ( eseem ) methods allowed us to identify the small hyperfine couplings , of the order of nuclear zeeman and nuclear quadrupole interactions , of @xmath5n nuclei that were distributed even more farther away from the unpaired electron of the six - atom silver cluster .",
    "these results suggested that the reduced coordination of low - nuclearity paramagnetic clusters is an important characteristic to maintain the open - shell configuration , correlated well with the _ electronic size effect_.    the _ surface size effect _ arises from the boundary condition for the confined electronic wavefunction at the surface . for sufficiently small metal clusters",
    "the relative merit is a fraction of atoms at the surface , and the low mean coordination number in turn implies a large fraction of the surface atoms @xcite .",
    "this surface characteristic features uniquely and is seen neither in ordinary bulk metals nor in compounds containing many complicated electronic bands .",
    "the properties of the surface atoms basically depend on the type of supports in particular .",
    "micro - porous zeolite supports have the advantages of preserving the metal cluster structure with the controlled size and distribution which are one of the most important factors in an activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysts @xcite .    extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) is a part of x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) and provides information about electronic and local structure of gas - adsorbed metal cluster catalysts under various conditions @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the coordination number and inter - atomic distance are the main structural parameters used extensively to evaluate the mean size and surface construction of small metal clusters",
    ". this technique can detect up to five nearest coordination shells surrounding absorber atoms @xcite .",
    "since exafs is an averaging technique , it detects an ensemble of ag clusters with the nearly same atomic size and structure , no matter whether these clusters are diamagnetic or paramagnetic according to their electron spin configuration and unpaired density distribution of silver clusters .",
    "the high sensitivity of exafs experiments provided us with accurate information of the local structure and coordination , which were significantly altered following adsorption @xcite .",
    "high nitric oxide ( no ) adsorption is of great interest for environmental applications in gas separation and no@xmath6 traps for lean burn engines .",
    "no is also an extremely important agent in biology , e.g. in the cardiovascular , nervous , and immune systems @xcite , and a storage of no in solids has potential applications as antithrombosis materials @xcite .",
    "the naa ( si / al = 1 ) zeolite was supplied by cu chemie uetikon ag in switzerland .",
    "zeolite samples were heated up in air at a rate of 0.5 k min@xmath7 to 773 k where they were kept for 14 hours in order to burn off any organic impurities .",
    "subsequently , 7 g of the heated sample was washed by stirring in 150 ml bi - distilled water containing 40 ml ( 10% ) solution and 2.76 g of salt at 343 k. this washing processes was repeated at least nine times .",
    "the washed sample was dried in air at 353 k for 24 hours .",
    "ag / naa samples were prepared in a flask containing 2.25 g of pre - treated zeolite by aqueous ion - exchange with 50 ml 50 mm solution ( chempur gmbh in germany , 99.998% ) by stirring at 343 k in the dark for 24 hours . the ion - exchanged sample was filtered and rinsed with deionized water several times , and dried in air at 353 k overnight .",

    "while the sample was held at the final temperature , the residual gas in the reactor was purged by ( westfalen ag , 99.999% ) gas for 1 hour . at 673 k , the heat treatment under oxygen leads to the extensive color changes from white to reddish yellow or dark yellow of ag / naa and it is a strong indication of the silver cluster formation .",
    "more importantly , xrd measurements proved the naa zeolite structure remained intact even after such a high temperature treatments ( diffraction pattern not shown ) .",
    "the xas measurements were performed at the ag k - edge ( 25.514 kev ) at the swiss - norwegian beamline ( snbl ) bm01b of the storage ring at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( grenoble , france ) .",
    "the x - rays were passed through a si(111 ) channel - cut monochromator and a chromium - coated mirror to reject the higher harmonics .",
    "all measurements were performed in transmission mode using ionization chambers for detection .",
    "a spectrum of a silver foil was acquired simultaneously with each measurement for energy calibration using a third ionization chamber .",
    "the oxidized catalyst samples of 12% ( wt . ) ag / naa were pressed into a self - supported wafer form with optimal thickness and positioned in a _ in - situ _ cell @xcite .",
    "all xas spectra of oxidized silver clusters were collected under dynamic vacuum ( or simply evacuation ) at 298 k. the sample was further reduced under an atmosphere of static hydrogen ( 5% in ) , and xas spectra were collected under 500 mbar partial pressure .",
    "the reduced sample was exposed to 1% in , and the spectra were collected under 1000 mbar partial pressure at 298 k. subsequently , oxygen ( 5% in ) was exposed to the nitrogen oxide adsorbed sample . complying with the safety regulations ,",
    "all of diluted gases were supplied by the storage ring .",
    "xas data analysis was carried out using the commercially available xdap software @xcite .",
    "the adsorption data were background - subtracted by means of standard procedures @xcite .",
    "the spectra were normalized on the height of the edge step at 100 ev above the edge .",
    "multiple - shell fitting was performed in @xmath1 space ( @xmath8  ) using a @xmath9-weighting of 1 , 2 , and 3 and a @xmath9 range of @xmath10 @xmath7 @xcite . a silver foil and were measured as references and analyzed using the feff8 @xcite .",
    "the only results of exafs at the ag @xmath0-edge of the oxidized and reduced six - atom clusters were reported in our peer - reviewed article @xcite .",
    "the highest fraction of the surface atoms implies a low mean coordination number of @xmath11 , which is accompanied by a direct consequence of the bond length contraction of ag - ag in the cluster . in total , the distance of the split ag - ag shell is contracted by @xmath12 as compared to the bulk distance of 2.889  .",
    "this effect is generally caused by the increased electron density between the atoms because of the re - hybridization of the @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 metal orbitals @xcite .    -weighted @xmath16 function ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 = 3.0 - 14 @xmath7 ) of the experimental exafs ( solid line ) with their theoretical fits ( dashed line ) with a split ag - ag shell and a single ag - o(n ) shell .",

    "after adsorbing in _ ex - situ _ , contributions of these atoms were identifiable from our pulsed epr experiments since oxygen is not magnetic with a zero nuclear spin @xcite .",
    "the intense peak at 2.5  in @xmath1-space of fourier transform of the @xmath17-weighted @xmath16 function represents the split ag - ag shell , while the ag - o(n ) shell is also observable at 1.9  ( figure [ fig : xas1]a ) .",
    "the coordination of the second ag - ag shell is of the order of @xmath19 , indicating that only @xmath20 atom was displaced from its position in this shell @xcite .",
    "the coordination of the first ag - ag shell remained intact with @xmath21 .",
    "the inter - atomic distances were almost the same 2.77  and 2.69  as previous for both shells .",
    "the local structure withstands the adsorption reaction , and the silver cluster exhibits the same atomic size as the reduced cluster .",
    "exafs is an averaging technique , and its detection is not limited as to whether the no adduct is adsorbed on diamagnetic or on paramagnetic clusters .",
    "it is therefore concluded that all six ag atoms are still at the cluster surface , thus possessing the same coordination numbers at virtually unchanged inter - atomic distances of the split ag - ag shell @xcite .",
    "a higher debye - waller factor corresponds to a large static disorder due to a high fraction of ag atoms at the cluster surface .",
    "the coordination of the ag - o shell plus nitrogen is of the order of @xmath22 at a distance of 2.29  .",
    "this distance reflects the bond length between silver and nitrogen atoms ( ag@xmath23n ) , compatible with the value obtained from the point - dipole approximation for the electron and nuclear spin magnetic dipoles @xcite .",
    "the value is considerably smaller than the oxygen shell coordination of the reduced silver cluster @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the silver clusters were just partially reduced by and became more reduced in the local structure when adsorbing .",
    "this also suggests that there was a number of oxygen atoms interspersed between the silver atoms of the cluster and decreased by adding more reductive gas molecule . above 3.5  ,",
    "a negligibly small deviation between the theoretical and experimental spectra is actually due to a contribution of light scattering n and o atoms ( figure [ fig : xas1]a ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fits are very good , especially the imaginary parts .",

    "raw data minus fitted ag - ag(2 ) and ag - o(n ) contributions ( red lines ) and the best fits of ag - ag(1 ) ( blue lines ) . ]    by exposing the no adsorbed cluster to , the silver cluster structure experienced further changes in the local structure ( figure [ fig : xas1]b ) . the same effect was observed that the epr signal of the no adduct shifted to the completely new hyperfine spectrum of the active species , namely paramagnetic after exposing that sample to at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the coordination of the first shell remained unchanged at the same distance of 2.70  .",
    "in the second ag - ag shell , the silver coordination increased to @xmath25 at an average distance of 2.76  , indicating that the silver cluster became less compact .",
    "thus , the total ag - ag coordination increased to a certain extent .",
    "a major change occurred to the ag - o(n ) shell as its coordination also increased to @xmath26 at an average distance of 2.26  .",
    "the intensity of this shell increased significantly in the @xmath1-space spectrum , suggesting that the silver clusters were oxidized again upon oxygen exposure .",
    "more importantly , the coordination difference before adding oxygen demonstrates again the silver to nitrogen ( ag - n ) coordination .",
    "the contribution of ag - o(n ) shell probably arose from only n atom , and hence one no molecule was adsorbed per cluster .    *",
