    "the theory of supertropical matrices , laid out in  @xcite , shows that although the ghost ideal in supertropical semifield @xmath0 , where  @xmath1 is a copy of  @xmath2 obtained as the image of the one - to - one ghost map  @xmath3 sending  @xmath4 , helps to recover many of the classical matrix theory properties , supertropical matrices still show a very undesired behavior when one wants to use them to decompose the supertropical vector - space @xmath5 as the sum of the eigenspaces of a matrix .",
    "previous work on the connection between supertropical matrices and their powers shows that the pathological behavior of a matrix , such as ghost level of its entries , its singularity , and dependency of its eigenvectors , can be avoided by passing to high enough powers of the matrix ( see  @xcite ) . in this paper",

    "we refer to the permutation track yielding the highest value in this sum as * the dominant permutation track*.    0.25 truecm we notice that over the supertropical structure the determinant is tangible whenever only one tangible permutation track dominates this sum , and ghost whenever either a ghost permutation track dominates it or at least two permutation tracks dominate it .",
